 is able to bring high speed internet to those areas who currently are 
either not able to receive high speed via traditional in ground 
copper/fiber or need more reliable service than currently is offered in 
their area. Most specifically this is found in suburban/rural areas and 
smaller communities on the outer ring “Last Mile” of urban areas like 
Minneapolis.</p><p>SkyNet’s solution for these areas, utilizes a digital
 wireless signal sent/broadcast through the air, similar to a cell

<p>SkyNet Broadband, Inc. offers fixed wireless broadband internet 
access. The internet service, which is up to 10x faster than DSL, only 
needs a roof radio antenna and must live within range of the signal 
which covers about a 3.5 mile radius from each tower site.</p><p>The 
high-speed technology is based off of the 3.65GHz licensed spectrum. 
This frequency is not in use by consumer communication devices(i.e. 
cordless phones, baby monitors etc.) which eliminates any interference 
compared to the antiquated 900 MHz channels. The network cable from the 
roof antenna into your home can be connected directly to a device (i.e. 
laptop) or into a wireless router to enable the signal to be sent 
wirelessly throughout your home.</p><p><b>Voice</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435170299/qmmucjqx7hqpuqykawdm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>                                               No more long distance charges!</i><b></b> <p>

</p><p>According to the FCC, the term “broadband” means 768 Kbps. According 
to the Minnesota Broadband Task Force’s definition, the minimum 
broadband speed should be 10-20 Mbps (download) and 5-10 Mbps (upload) 
for all residents of Minnesota. These speeds allow communities to grow 
jobs, improve educational opportunities and have faster access to health
 care services. As of October 2014 only 78% of Minnesotans had access to
 these speeds.</p><p>For the most part, broadband networks have evolved 
from two existing networks: cable and telephone. Only in the last few 
years have new networks been deployed that are specifically built for 
the purpose and use of broadband. The various types of broadband are 
outlined below:</p><p>    Cable. A coaxial connection that uses the 
cable TV wiring for transmission.
    DSL (digital subscriber line). A connection that utilizes the copper
 phone lines as the method of transmission.
    Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH). To be classified as FTTH, the access fiber
 must cross the subscriber’s premises boundary and terminate inside the 
premises, or on an external wall of the subscriber’s premises, or not 
more than 2 meters from an external wall of the subscriber’s premises.
    Mobile wireless. A connection that uses the mobile phone towers for 
transmission.

<p>SkyNet’s website 
is designed to allow a potential customer to enter their address and 
determine if they are within our coverage area. On a daily basis, our 
website takes in numerous requests for service from outside of our 
coverage area. These customers have used or are currently using either 
satellite internet or cellular hotspot technology and are extremely 
dissatisfied due to the huge limitations and disadvantages. Satellite 
and Cellular have much of the same issues between them, such as:</p>
<p>    Both require the leasing or purchasing of equipment
    Both have data caps preventing customers from utilizing the full potential of the internet
    Both have high latency times, which causes additional lag time to access the internet and disrupts VoIP service.
    Both require contracts
    Both are very costly when compared to the service being provided.</p>
<p>Simply
 put, rural areas outside the current coverage area are begging to have a
 better alternative to their current options. SkyNet’s solution for 
rural areas can not only address their needs but exceed their 
expectations.  </p>
<p><b>Expansion Plan Strategy and Implementation Summary</b></p>
<p>SkyNet’s
 strategy is to expand our service into neighboring cities by activating
 additional sites. SkyNet Broadband, Inc. will facilitate its expansion 
via a phased approach, expanding tower site by tower site across the 
targeted areas.</p>
<p><b>Competitive Edge</b></p>
<p>SkyNet’s competitive
 edge lies in our ability to be the first internet service provider to 
bring high speed wireless internet with fiber optic speeds. The “state 
of the art” SkyNet equipment is the first of its kind to be deployed in 
our target market.</p>
<p>Additionally, SkyNet is able to install and 
activate a broadcast site in a fraction of the time and cost it would 
take for traditional hard line connections.</p>
<p><b>Marketing Strategy</b></p>
<p>SkyNet employs a multi-pronged marketing approach:</p>
<p>
    Mailings. SkyNet utilizes a targeted mailing campaign to the local 
residents.
    Website. SkyNet leverages its website as a comprehensive and 
efficient source of marketing/sales information.
    Outside Sales. SkyNet uses an outside sales staff to have direct 
contact with business owners and in turn with employees.
    Billboards. SkyNet’s use of billboards will increase name 
recognition and encourage visits to our website.
    Public transportation. SkyNet’s use of advertising on public 
transportation vehicles will increase name recognition and encourage 
visits to our website.
    Company Vehicle. All of SkyNet’s vehicles have been wrapped entirely
 with our logo and company identity which acts as a moving billboard 
throughout the communities we service.
    Word of Mouth. Last but not least is the word of mouth results from 
our extremely satisfied customers.</p>
<p><b>Sales Strategy</b></p>
<p>The
 sales strategy SkyNet employs is based on developing awareness of 
SkyNet’s service as a viable alternative to cable and DSL within the 
community. The message we use is “you can receive broadband connections 
to your computer, wherever it may be, even your laptop on your front 
lawn, at higher speeds than what your current options provide.” <br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary (Note reduced goal! $35,000 Revised to $20K!!)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have been in sales and marketing for 30 years, Several of those years in residential roofing as a general contractor.</li>
<li>Split boots lack structural support, take too long to install, and usually don't do any favors for the new appearance expected. With no reasonably priced  visually appealing products on the market, I designed one.</li>
<li>Patent was submitted in early December (already had the provisional for a year), First 2 quarters of sales and marketing has been laid out (8 states). Tooling, packaging, printed materials, office expenses and first production run for early sales and demonstration samples funding is needed.</li>
<li>All tooling is laid out and ready to mill the molds and start production, just need MONEY!</li>
<li>Reaching the funding goal will allow all aspects of the first 180 days of operations to move forward. Marketing to the contractors who will use the product and selling to the distributors who those contractors buy from will be established enough that sales will fund operations after 180 days. First orders and revenue will begin 60-90 days after launch.</li>
<li>Client relationship manager software bundled with prospect database access has been sourced. Packaging needs have been sourced, All marketing and sales leads have been laid out for the first 180 days and rough drafts for 4 quarters following,</li>
<li>Wages, advertising expenses, necessary printed materials, sales trip expenses are planned. Looking for<strong> $20,000</strong>toward the total required.  Falling short of this goal will slow the launch but not stop it. In reality it started years ago, this campaign is to fund finishing the roll out but the process was started years ago.</li>
<li>A comfortable, 2 quarter roll out is what has been planned but it may instead be an uncomfortable 3 or 4 quarter bumpy roll out with erratic sales and marketing plans, which route is dependent on how much of the funding goal is reached.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>$15000 Packaging materials, web site for contractors, website for distributors to order, office supplies, envelopes and printed materials to send to contractors and potential distributors .</li>
<li>All contribution promotional perks include catch phrase ""if you cant get over it, go around it"" with the exploded drawing of the Garrdal 2 piece boot.</li>
<li>The goal is to reach <strong>$20000</strong> (now)knowing that will get Garrdal over the 180 day hump.</li>
<li>All aspects of Garrdal compared to alternatives, favor Garrdal. Price, installation speed, reliability and how it looks. Potential customers, roofers in particular need to know it exists.</li>
<li>Mailing information to roofing contractors with websites in larger counties will stimulate activity with contractors asking their local suppliers about availability.</li>
<li>Roofing contractors contacting their suppliers will stimulate interest from those suppliers and increase traffic to Garrdal related social media. Most importantly, distributors will react faster as buyers if their customers have asked about a product. Their own research after a customer inquiry will have many trying to stock the product before a Garrdal sales call.</li>
<li>Availability through suppliers needs to be established as quickly as possible not only for revenue but to assure interested contractors actually get the chance to use the product sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>Contractors will call the branch, the branch will be mailed, a Garrdal representative will call the branch and purchaser, I will visit the branch to demonstrate with a sample.</li>
<li>The potential market is over a million units yearly! 600,000 or more roofs with electrical weather head masts are re-shingled each year and another million with roof mounted satellite receivers. Only a portion of the potential market is the target for the first couple of years. Controlled growth is easier to manage. 3000 units monthly is enough to cover expenses.  As volume grows so can staff for more growth.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>For those who haven't shingled a roof, a pipe boot is the flashing that gets pushed over a <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484060710/dbxqdxv0siob3omoomxf.png"" src="""" style=""""/>pipe. It is fastened to the roof and shingled around to weatherproof the perforation.</li>
<li>What if there is something that prevents the roofer from pushing the boot over the pipe? Wires? Antennas? Knuckles?<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484061278/ybyeuyakbtv5rpmmm2f3.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484061411/jsk0oxzntl3roozcfhf3.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484061790/ttygbclyrwlay6xgylqs.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>When replacing or repairing the roof conventional boots can't go over these obstacles. The solution is a lot of messy caulking and paint and trying to reuse the existing flashing or an expensive split boot with no structural support except a metal clip or zipper or pipe clamp, Each of these are time consuming, unreliable and often unsightly.</li>
<li>600,000 roofs with electrical service masts are re-shingled each year in USA, plus repairs.</li>
<li>There are 34 million satellite dish TV subscribers in the USA, 25 million roof mounted. Replacing a roof every 25 years equals 1 million roofers yearly need to remove and realign the  receiver. Alternatively you could seal the receiver arm with a Garrdal 2 piece boot.</li>
<li>Numerous knuckled clay or cast iron soil stacks protrude through roofs on older homes. Reusing existing boots or modifying 1 piece boots with lots of caulk is a common solution to weatherproof these boots. A time consuming endeavor with unsightly results. Another practical instance that Garrdal pipe boot can be used. And save time and money.</li>
<li>A possible market of easily over 1 million units yearly.</li>
<li>Your contribution will help take Garrdal from years of planning and designing to actual production, marketing and sales of the product.</li>
<li>Even if total funding goals aren't met from the campaign, manufacturing can begin and Garrdal can be introduced to the marketplace.</li>
<li>If the campaign is short, marketing and sales will be behind schedule but at least they can start, even if at a slower pace than hoped.</li>
<li>A monetary contribution or sharing of this page are each very much appreciated!</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Production keeping up with sales</strong> may become a problem but what a great problem to have. If sales go beyond manufacturing capabilities a second set of tooling will be needed. That would mean Garrdal having more profits to pay for the tooling though. Looking forward to that problem!</p>
<p><strong>Sales growth</strong>, most industries face the challenge of finding quality salespeople who are also familiar with the industry. Garrdal sells 1 product to a relatively small, easily defined set of buyers. New hires will be account managers who maintain those accounts with very little if any cold calling required. Qualified candidates can be found with a customer service or account management background or someone with industry experience, especially shingle roofing and good organizational and communication skills. Controlled growth and hiring and training will be an easy burden to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Office location needed </strong>in the future. In the short term an account manager can work with me. This will be an added expense that fortunately  will be covered by revenues. This additional expense will only be necessary when sales growth and revenues and staffing needs warrant.</p>
<p>I have trained sales teams, phone rooms and customer departments as well as built sales offices from scratch in the past. Each of these potential obstacles are welcomed especially since each challenge means Garrdal sales are growing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Roofers have been spending more than a Garrdal boot costs to modify 2 boots and mash them together for years. Share this page with your entire social network and it will find it's way to them.</p>
<p>Share it often, even with those you know  can't help fund the  campaign, they can share it!!</p>
<p>Contributions and brand awareness or people knowing about the product are equally important. If someone sends this to someone who sends it to a roofer that isn't on a mailing list we will use, a goal has been reached. That roofer will remember the product and talk about it.</p>
<p>Share, share, share. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. The funding campaign is relatively short. The more eyes and sharing of the campaign the faster goals can be reached and recognition maximized.</p>
<p>There are really 2 campaigns in play here. A funding campaign and a product recognition campaign. Expanding on either side is helpful.</p>
<p>Share <a href=""http://www.garrdal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.garrdal.com</a> , there are more photos and information about the product and it's uses there but remember that it is under construction still.

This means that you pay all duties or taxes in your country if applicable. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through indiegogo.If you would like to estimate your duties, you can use this online tool (remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency):simplyduty.com/import-calculator/For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs (including marking an order as a gift, which we cannot do). Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery. Shipping & Return PolicyIt is critical that you enter your correct, valid address when placing your order. If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't get it because you’re not there, wrong address or moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.We are not accepting returns of the blacksor disk on key that are ordered via Indiegogo . However, if your device is not perfect, please reach out to us at info@blacksor.com, and we will do whatever we can to help make it right! Risks and ChallengesAs you can see on the timeline, we have been working on this product for more than a year, and have already completed the design / development and have moved forward on the process of creating all the molds, fixtures, and processes needed for mass production.Here are a few risks and challenges that we can think of:Product Manufacturing DelaysWe’ve produced a small run of samples and we feel confident that a large production order will be successful; however, it is common that factories can have unforeseen setbacks. We plan to stay in constant communication with our manufacturer including working on-site to resolve any challenges that may arise.Shipping DelaysAs with any manufactured good, delays can happen -- a typhoon can hit, or a pallet can get stuck in a shipyard. We’ve padded our schedule to accommodate some changes, but will let our backers know immediately if we foresee any updates to the timeline for delivery.",55.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Because we spent so long developing and testing The Food Lover, we can be 100% sure that it will become the first thing you reach for when you want to cook up some more magical memories.Whether it’s an old family recipe passed down from your ancestors to something brand new to wow your dinner guests, The Food Lover will help you produce meals no one will ever forget. Features    ColorsYour pan and grill lid are both in classic black Pure Iron color.For your main pot, select from RED and obviously PURE IRON. Your choice will be processed after the end of the campaign.  Technical Specs The Food Lover are among the lightest cast iron pots on the market. They are perfectly weight balanced with a double handler for easy grip. The removable stay-cool silicone handle grips withstand temperatures up to 500 degrees F.Every piece of iron at our foundry is sampled and tested to meet the highest standards.  Food Lover pots and pans are made from 75-90% recycled iron. They’re non-toxic, with no added paints or chemicals. Plus, we recycle all the sand from the casting so, no waste! We offer a lifetime guarantee on all our cookware. Perks  Timeline TimelineMeet The Team  When it comes to food, Italy like nowhere else in the world. In Italy, food is art, passion. TheFoodLover is a team of Italian cooks and designers in search of the perfect taste. In the last few years, The Food Lover team has brought dozens of ideas to life, helping cooks just like you create better dishes and have more fun in the kitchen. Now, we’ve created a revolutionary cookware system. We can’t wait for you to enjoy it!",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

How it worksZero Ossigeno Lamps can be turned on and off with just a small wave of your hand. They have no physical switch, using instead a proximity sensor connected to a microprocessor that allows the lamp to be turned on and off by simply placing your hand over the light source. The name is derived from the amount of oxygen that remains during the combustion of a flame when it gets covered. The two lamps, presented as prototypes for the first time at Operae 2015 Independent design festival, are entirely self produced. The design of the circuit has been realized by Laboratorio Creativo Geppetto.Zero Ossigeno Candle         In
this version the lamp can be turned on by placing your hand on it.

How awesome is that! <b>Help us fund this project, every amount counts! </b>You will also allow us to stop breaking the filament down into 50 gram samples by hand and help us get the right equipment so that we can keep our prices affordable for everyone.

By backing us we will be able to solve all three of those problems by allowing you to try unique and awesome filament at a very low cost, which you most likely wouldn't have purchased other wise.<b> Help us reach our goal and you can choose what filament samples you want every month!</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will help bring jobs, happy faces, and a beautiful woman (My Wife) who is about to have a baby in July some comfort knowing that things are going to be all right.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>There has been a lot of time put into getting partnering companies together to work with us at a low cost to help keep it affordable for everyone. Now that we have the partnering companies, we need your help! We are confident in our partners, however, we do feel that there are a few challenges.</p>
<p><b>First Challenge</b> is the fulfillment process. Once we have reached our goal on Indiegogo we will start receiving filament spools and breaking them down into 50 gram samples. We have confidence in our partners getting us the spool amounts needed but we know there can be unexpected time delays with producing the filament. We will do our best in this aspect to get our partners shipping us the spools as soon as we reach our Indiegogo goal so that we can make sure to get any delays out of the way early.</p>
<p><b>Second Challenge</b> is to accurately cut and weigh our filament samples. Currently we have been cutting the filament samples by hand into 50 gram samples and weighing them on a scale. We are confident that with the right equipment we can get them into 50 gram samples cheaper and quicker to make it affordable for everyone.</p>
<p><b>The Third Challenge</b> is customer confidence and satisfaction. We want to make sure that once our backers have our product and are printing with the samples, that they feel like they can count on us every month to continue to deliver to their expectations. We will continue finding out what samples from what companies people are wanting, so that we can do all we can to make sure to get them every month.</p>
<p><b>We want to make sure you, the backer, is confident and happy with your purchase!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>By the end of the Campaign</b> <br/>- Filament spools will begin being shipped to our location</p>
<p><b>By May</b><br/>- Filament spools will start being broken down into 50 gram samples <br/>- 3D printers will start printing with samples to get the best printer settings</p>
<p><b>By June </b><br/>- Start shipping out first month's filament samples</p>
<p><b>By July</b><br/>- Start getting feedback from customers about what we can do better every month to make their experience with us unforgettable!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you don't own a 3D printer or have a need for our monthly subscription, don't worry, you can share our unique video and campaign with someone you know who does. You can even help us reach out through social media or even come and help us get started breaking down the filament and testing them to get the best printer settings. We want you to get into 3D Printing if you don't have a 3D Printer. Click on the Indiegogo share tools and help us get started!</p>

My name is Cole Washburn and I have been working in the 3D Printing Industry for about 3 years now. My background is in Manufacturing Engineering and Technology and I have worked in and 3D printed parts for the Oil-Field and Aerospace Industry. I believe that 3D printing is one of the keys to using creativity to make new prototypes to help make our lives easier and more enjoyable.
What We Need & What You Get In order for Filapack to ship out filament samples that people want every month and keep it affordable for everyone, we need to get the right equipment, inventory, and partnering companies.
When you help us get funded we will be able to establish ourselves as a more reliable company which will help us get more partnering companies so that you can get the filament samples that you want each month at a low cost. How awesome is that! Help us fund this project, every amount counts! You will also allow us to stop breaking the filament down into 50 gram samples by hand and help us get the right equipment so that we can keep our prices affordable for everyone. Let's work together to get this project funded. And once we're funded simply let us know what filament size (1.75mm or 3mm) you want shipped every month and it will arrive! Also, every subscription has FREE U.S. SHIPPING!
      




    The Impact Everyone hates wasting money, time, and filament. By backing us we will be able to solve all three of those problems by allowing you to try unique and awesome filament at a very low cost, which you most likely wouldn't have purchased other wise. Help us reach our goal and you can choose what filament samples you want every month!
Your contribution will help bring jobs, happy faces, and a beautiful woman (My Wife) who is about to have a baby in July some comfort knowing that things are going to be all right.
    Risks & Challenges  
There has been a lot of time put into getting partnering companies together to work with us at a low cost to help keep it affordable for everyone. Now that we have the partnering companies, we need your help! We are confident in our partners, however, we do feel that there are a few challenges.
First Challenge is the fulfillment process. Once we have reached our goal on Indiegogo we will start receiving filament spools and breaking them down into 50 gram samples. We have confidence in our partners getting us the spool amounts needed but we know there can be unexpected time delays with producing the filament. We will do our best in this aspect to get our partners shipping us the spools as soon as we reach our Indiegogo goal so that we can make sure to get any delays out of the way early.
Second Challenge is to accurately cut and weigh our filament samples. Currently we have been cutting the filament samples by hand into 50 gram samples and weighing them on a scale. We are confident that with the right equipment we can get them into 50 gram samples cheaper and quicker to make it affordable for everyone.
The Third Challenge is customer confidence and satisfaction. We want to make sure that once our backers have our product and are printing with the samples, that they feel like they can count on us every month to continue to deliver to their expectations. We will continue finding out what samples from what companies people are wanting, so that we can do all we can to make sure to get them every month.
We want to make sure you, the backer, is confident and happy with your purchase!

By the end of the Campaign - Filament spools will begin being shipped to our location
By May- Filament spools will start being broken down into 50 gram samples - 3D printers will start printing with samples to get the best printer settings
By June - Start shipping out first month's filament samples
By July- Start getting feedback from customers about what we can do better every month to make their experience with us unforgettable!
    Other Ways You Can Help If you don't own a 3D printer or have a need for our monthly subscription, don't worry, you can share our unique video and campaign with someone you know who does. You can even help us reach out through social media or even come and help us get started breaking down the filament and testing them to get the best printer settings. We want you to get into 3D Printing if you don't have a 3D Printer. Click on the Indiegogo share tools and help us get started!
Thanks a million!

<p><b>The Car Caddie Journey:</b></p>
<p>I
have been a serial entrepreneur all my life. I was always looking for simple
products that would help people resolve some difficulties, or just make life a
little easier and fun. I was working on hypoallergenic foam that removes sand
off of the body at the beach, for many years. As I was testing different
densities, shapes, sizes, and textures of foam, I discovered this particular
foam, which I fell in love with, immediately. The texture, flexibility,
property, and the overall quality of the foam were captivating. I realized it
had many distinctive and amazing functional attributes. I then started the
arduous task of testing and retesting this remarkable foam, in order to perfect
the density, use, and function. There were many hurtles along this journey like
figuring a way to bring my product to patent and finding someone to manufacture
it, but all the work paid off. After, years of working with unique foams, I
proudly bring you Car Caddie.  </p>
<p><b>An Idea is Born:</b></p>
<p>Brainstorming
with a thin piece of foam in my hand, I was on the way to the office one
morning and as usual I picked up a cup of coffee. I always hated driving with
my cell phone in my pocket because it was very uncomfortable, so I had my cell
phone in the cup holder. With the foam in my hand and the cell phone in the cup
holder, I just casually threw the foam onto the dashboard. It landed on the
curved part of the passenger side dashboard and it stuck there. The light went
on, I knew exactly what to do with the cell phone needing the cup holder for my
coffee. When I was exiting my car and reached over to grab my cell phone and
the foam, I noticed the area where the foam was sitting was cleared of dust. I
proceeded to dust off the dashboard and the adventure began. I have really
committed myself to this project and really hope that the Car Caddie will bring
a little joy and cleanliness into your life.</p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>RISK AND CHALLENGES:</b></p>
<p>1.
There is a production quantity minimum due to the nature of the foam and the
difficulty of manufacturing. That minimum can be satisfied if there is a
commitment for at least 5,000 pieces. If the 5,000 piece minimum is not
fulfilled production may be delayed.</p>
<p>2.
It is foam and like most foams it does absorb moister. When moister is absorbed
it temporarily losses it's shape. When dried the shape is reestablished.
Customers need to be patient and allow for the foam to dry.</p>
<p>3.
It is not a sponge and using it as a sponge is a misuse of the product.</p>

<p>The principles of Best Frame Shops have a combined 50 years of experience in dealing with fine and rare art as well as museum caliber custom framing.<br/>The principle acquired a small San Diego art and framing operation in 2013 after operating one of the largest galleries in a large eastern city for many years. </p>
<p>The chief technician is a meticulous craftsman with 20 years of experience in a vast array of fabrication skills that many sales persons in the big box stores have never heard of.</p>
<p>While his skills can't cover all the anticipated fabrication needs of the company, his ability to train others and set quality standards is essential to growing this business.</p>
<p>The art operations of the gallery continues as dealing in rare and fine art can be done in the age of the internet almost anywhere. However the framing operation evolved in an entirely unexpected manner.  </p>
<p>Most of the retail framing customers that we met were looking for an alternative to the big box national brands. They wanted a more personalized, professional service, faster turnaround than could be found in remotely serviced ""stores"" along with reasonable prices and quality workmanship all of  which they found seriously lacking at the big box stores.</p>
<p>Perhaps more surprising, the best employees of the big box stores came by looking for employment.  Many of these employees had artistic backgrounds, which is a particularly fragile vocation, and were all too easily manipulated by the Wall St. run firms to accept anything in their field meaning low wages, part time benefit free work and impossible scheduling.<br/> </p>
<p>Kicking this around we realized that this corporate model was all too often seen in America in recent years.

</div></div>","The principles of Best Frame Shops have a combined 50 years of experience in dealing with fine and rare art as well as museum caliber custom framing.The principle acquired a small San Diego art and framing operation in 2013 after operating one of the largest galleries in a large eastern city for many years. 
The chief technician is a meticulous craftsman with 20 years of experience in a vast array of fabrication skills that many sales persons in the big box stores have never heard of.
While his skills can't cover all the anticipated fabrication needs of the company, his ability to train others and set quality standards is essential to growing this business.
The art operations of the gallery continues as dealing in rare and fine art can be done in the age of the internet almost anywhere. However the framing operation evolved in an entirely unexpected manner.  
Most of the retail framing customers that we met were looking for an alternative to the big box national brands. They wanted a more personalized, professional service, faster turnaround than could be found in remotely serviced ""stores"" along with reasonable prices and quality workmanship all of  which they found seriously lacking at the big box stores.
Perhaps more surprising, the best employees of the big box stores came by looking for employment.  Many of these employees had artistic backgrounds, which is a particularly fragile vocation, and were all too easily manipulated by the Wall St. run firms to accept anything in their field meaning low wages, part time benefit free work and impossible scheduling. 
Kicking this around we realized that this corporate model was all too often seen in America in recent years. Big investment funds, usually handling money for wealthy individuals would set up well funded businesses which outsourced their suppliers to get very low prices and then hire low paid domestic employees to sell them.  The profits were often kept offshore and the owners were paid in low or no tax dollars using various offshore and other tax avoidance strategies which the Wall St. investment banks specialize in.  The Wall Street off shore model dominates most brands and it is no accident that they have a competitive advantage as they keep most of their costs at bare minimums to maximize profits.And this model was seen in the picture framing industry as practiced in the big box stores as well. 
 It seemed to us that another model could be developed where employees could earn middle class wages with basic 21st century benefits like health insurance and earned leave if the profits were not siphoned off by various financial strategies engineered by Wall St. financiers. Shareholders would benefit as well if corporate earnings were sent directly to the stockholders instead of passing through the sticky hands of Wall Street.  And, it seems to us,  an unusual confluence of circumstances exists in this industry that makes it possible for these benefits to be realized with the the Best Frame Shops model as there is little comparable competition in this market

<p> </p>
<p>DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT</p>
<p>One Note at a Time, set in New Orleans, has been nine years in the making. Four of these were spent following a small number of musicians from different genres, as they came to terms with their changed city, musical landscape and life. Intertwined are their musical and health stories, as they frequent the New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic, a lifeline and comfort, that simultaneously had its own struggles, whilst aspiring to fulfil a mission to ‘keep the music ALIVE’.</p>
<p>I felt compelled to make this film having visited the city throughout my life to see my family. I’m British born to an English mother and African American father. School summer holidays were regularly spent in New Orleans. As an adult I came to know the city in a new way, and very much appreciated the live sound of the music which beat through my childhood in England and America. I think the storm and subsequent destruction made me sad for my own loss, as well as the people who suffered directly. I had only started to get to know the city on my own terms for the few years before Katrina hit.</p>
<p>Through the film we were able to capture a special moment in music history, even though the issues raised in the film are ongoing. One unusual aspect to the film is that a number of the musicians have sadly passed away since we started filming, and so the film includes some of their last performances and interviews, and honours them; these musicians include Wardell Quezergue, Uncle Lionel Batiste, Walter Payton Jr, Herman ‘Roscoe’ Ernest and Clarence ’Trixzey’ Slaughter.</p>
<p>I believe as a black, female film maker, who led a team of American and English crew, and almost all American cast, that I was able to tell this story in a unique way, because of my own heritage and history.</p>
<p>Bethany Ewald Bultman, co-founding director of the New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic, featured in the documentary, wrote me recently after viewing the film, ""The powerful question of your film is IF New Orleans’ music will survive? You artfully depict the factors from without and within which are undermining its health and survival. No other film has ever accomplished this.’</p>
<p>I’m very happy we have achieved this, and hope the audience enjoys it, and finds it a valuable record and salute to all the musicians of New Orleans and their supporters.</p>

DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
One Note at a Time, set in New Orleans, has been nine years in the making. Four of these were spent following a small number of musicians from different genres, as they came to terms with their changed city, musical landscape and life. Intertwined are their musical and health stories, as they frequent the New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic, a lifeline and comfort, that simultaneously had its own struggles, whilst aspiring to fulfil a mission to ‘keep the music ALIVE’.
I felt compelled to make this film having visited the city throughout my life to see my family. I’m British born to an English mother and African American father. School summer holidays were regularly spent in New Orleans. As an adult I came to know the city in a new way, and very much appreciated the live sound of the music which beat through my childhood in England and America. I think the storm and subsequent destruction made me sad for my own loss, as well as the people who suffered directly. I had only started to get to know the city on my own terms for the few years before Katrina hit.
Through the film we were able to capture a special moment in music history, even though the issues raised in the film are ongoing. One unusual aspect to the film is that a number of the musicians have sadly passed away since we started filming, and so the film includes some of their last performances and interviews, and honours them; these musicians include Wardell Quezergue, Uncle Lionel Batiste, Walter Payton Jr, Herman ‘Roscoe’ Ernest and Clarence ’Trixzey’ Slaughter.
I believe as a black, female film maker, who led a team of American and English crew, and almost all American cast, that I was able to tell this story in a unique way, because of my own heritage and history.
Bethany Ewald Bultman, co-founding director of the New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic, featured in the documentary, wrote me recently after viewing the film, ""The powerful question of your film is IF New Orleans’ music will survive? You artfully depict the factors from without and within which are undermining its health and survival. No other film has ever accomplished this.’
I’m very happy we have achieved this, and hope the audience enjoys it, and finds it a valuable record and salute to all the musicians of New Orleans and their supporters.

Have you ever started packing for a trip, only to realize you need to store your toothbrush somewhere and simply cannot find a clean place to leave it? Among the piles of dirty socks, and old zipper bags, or just wrapped in toilet paper you may leave those bristles for several hours of flight time and baggage claim, yuck!

So let's take a trip somewhere awesome, safe in the knowledge your toothbrush has never been this clean!</p>

<h3>how do we manage quality?</h3>
<p>To start with we use the same quality bristles as the leading brands! We also invest heavily in human and robotic controls throughout the entire manufacturing process of your brushettes. First the PE, POM, and filaments raw materials get a one-time SGS laboratory inspection. During the assembly lines we have quality control checkpoints at each stage until we reach the finished product. With QC/QA from TÜV laboratories we report every step of the process to comply with ISO 9001:2015 (latest) norms. The quality of the products you put in your mouth is our top priority. As with every product in the world, sometimes during manufacturing defects can arise. We strive for perfection but if for any reason you remain unhappy with your order we offer full customer support to resolve this.</p>

I feel free and cleaner.""Dr Arielle Van Krey - dentist""From the basic functions to the specific ones everything has been thought of. Glad Brushette® figured everyone's hygiene needs a different treatment.""Stephanie Bloomstein - Apaga Technology""We were handed a full set of toothbrush, sterilizers and bristles. Well as Head of HR the personnel perceive this as a great perk. Highly recommended to the corporate world."" Patrick Lorey - early adopter""I've been using brushette for 3 months and it's particularly convenient for travelling. Toss in a few packets in your vanity case, they don't break and become very handy between 2 planes.""

Led socket is 3D printed in our 3D printing farm in the Netherlands. 
The bulb socket is in high quality aluminium.
Two of our lamps were exposed in their show room during the factory's Open Days. We already produced the components for first 100 lamps. Actually, we are in the assembling phase and first lamps should be finished in the middle of February. The deliveries will start before the end of the campaign so that our contributeurs can receive their lamps very fast.We will keep you informed in the updates and comments section when the first deliveries will start. The biggest challenge was the lighting. The lamp is attractive and eye catching and as it's made in full transparent glass, we had issues with blinding. We also wanted the lighting source to be central and, finally, 3D printing technology helped us solving this problem. We have experimented a lot and made adjustments till we found the perfect solution. We enjoyed the 3D printing so much, that we decided to continue producing our led sockets by ourselves in our own 3D printing farm. Wire engraving was another issue. For 3D engraving you need a perfectly flat penetration zone for the laser beam. It's not possible with our curved bulbs. We had to develop our own engraving technique that allows us to not only use the rare flat zones for engraving, but also to get them in a good angle.    Pressing the glass into the bulbs.Laser engraving of the wire.Led socket 3D printing.     As we already produced all the components for 120 first lamps, we will start the assembly production few days after the beginning of Indiegogo campaign. Like this we can begin deliveries in the second half of February.  Our first goal is to satisfy our backers very fast.",37.0,1,"1 Campaign

VR PREVIEWUsing a VR Head Mount Device, you can immerse yourself into the designed space from your point of view to get the real world feel of how it looks from your perspective.
Archisketch automates all the laborious works from measuring, modeling to planning so you can start interior designing your own space on our platform in a matter of MINUTES. Whether it is for

Moving-in to a new place 

Renovating your current place or 
Simply changing you furniture 
Archisketch makes it easy.Compatible with the workflows of pre-existing softwares, you can import and export 3D files from/to Archisketch.Watch how you can even import your own furniture into our platform in a matter of seconds.The idea of the Archisketch came from personal frustrations that we have repeatedly faced as Architects. In almost every renovation or interior construction projects;
Even experts walk around each corner of a building & measure them one-by-one 


3D Modeling is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that requires months of training to be proficient at
The traditional way of interior designing involves a tape measure or a laser with tedious steps of measuring, making notes, measuring again and so on. On top of that, you have to use difficult and expensive 3D software to build a model.The existing solutions were either
Too expensive


Limited in functionalities

Fragmented in terms of the scope it covers and

SLOW  
Archisketch is a byproduct of countless hours of research on pre-existing solutions. Putting aside professional devices that were too expensive and not accessible to everyday people, the mobile application based interior designing software was simply inaccurate and fragmented.Our new measuring method combines hardware sensors and computer vision technology software, so you can get accurate measurements of lines, areas, and floorplans of enclosed spaces in high precision.Sensors within our hardware complements and completes the software side of Archisketch to innovate shortcomings of traditional measuring software - combining the pros to provide even more accurate AR driven measuring solution.

Aside from the tools used and types of spaces measured, we measure spaces with a tape measure, put samples on the wall and floor in advance - just like the professionals -  to see how it would look while searching for decors presented on the web. 

It's a personal assistant in your pocket to fulfill your interests in designing your own home like the professionals do except that it is

Intuitive
Easy

Automated 





Mode 01. Laser Distance Measure

Measures distance between you & target object

Archisketch's laser pointed at the target accurately measures the distance between you and your object up to 1,574 inches (40 meters).

Mode 02. AR Distance Measure

Measures distance between any two objects

Driven by augmented reality, AR distance mode measures distance between any two objects up to 787 inches (20 meters).
 


 
Mode 03. Space Capture
Measures any space 3-dimensionally to auto-generate 2D & 3D floorplans
Mark each corner to automatically generate 2D and 3D floor plans of your space. Capable of measuring up to 787 inches (20 meters).







ACCESSORY MODULE
This particular accessory is an external battery, 9-axis sensors and a bluetooth module that allows Archisketch to be standalone. That means, Archisketch doesn't have to be attached to your phone any longer and still communicates with your phone regardless of your model.
 

Following are the photos of the most up-to-date working prototype of the Accessory Module. 

 

We’re redefining the way we design our spaces. While we’ve come this far with an incredibly small team and a boot-strapped budget, we need your help in making this technology a reality.
Our goal is to not only develop a product but help educate the world on the potential of ARCHISKETCH. To do this, we need your support from this initial campaign to not only fund our production but also get the word out about what we’re developing.

 
Our team got together for a habitat project, a volunteer activity group to build and design homes for disadvantaged people. After debating about Architecture and the problems that lie within the current system, Archisketch has been founded and joined by experts in electronics and telecommunication fields.Once we start manufacturing our products in the mass scale after a successful campaign, we would like to make a promise to you backers and Habitat Community that we will be distributing spare Archisketch devices to Habitat for free to support fellow volunteers that work hard for noble cause.




This is the most capital-intensive part of our next phase. We’ve developed many products over the course of our careers, so we’ve got a very good idea on costs needed to produce the initial molds, purchase supplies, meet the minimum quantity order, and ship to consumers. We need your help to get us to the production phase of our hardware.


 
 

Even as we are running a Kickstarter campaign, we are still working hard to improve our product by listening to you. Not only that, we are constantly on the move to let the world know about our product.
We will keep you updated on where and when to find us.

<p>There are several studies that examine the impact of leaks in homes and the impact of metering. Studies by the EPA and USGS indicate that as much as 15% of the average homeowner’s water use is attributed to leaks. Other studies demonstrate the presence of a monthly-read meter can reduce water consumption by 5-30%. Analysis of U.S. consumption behaviors suggest there is a 20% reduction opportunity for homeowners by improving water habits. The conclusion is that a device like H2know can help save the average U.S. homeowner $250 in water-related expenses every year.</p>
<p>In addition, a plumbing leak or burst pipe is the most common non-weather related home insurance claim. There are various studies on this topic, we use the mid-range estimates of 1 million insurance claims at an average of $10,000 per claim. This means the average home has a 1 in 75 chance of a catastrophic leak this year and every year. We want to put an end to those leaks and give you peace of mind.</p>

<p>The sum of leaks and unwanted use across all homes in the U.S. is a staggering 2 trillion gallons of water. That is enough water to meet the needs of homes in our 50 largest cities for an entire year. Access to clean water and the infrastructure to deliver that water is increasingly stressed and puts demands on the environment. In addition, water conveyance (moving water from its source to the home to sewage treatment) is one of the leading consumers of energy. The energy consumption on leaks and unwanted water usage alone produces an estimated 3.7 million MT Tons of CO2 every year.</p>

After extensive testing for over a year, the Conservation Labs team began a more aggressive and formal private field test program in October 2017 that included both residential and commercial properties.
Our goal with these tests is to identify and solve real-world plumbing and environmental challenges.
The current field test program will continue through 2018 to identify and solve challenges before the first product ships.
The Device
On the device side of our solution, our engineering team has brought multiple products to market and manages relationships with multiple manufacturers.
We intentionally built the H2know device with as few components as possible, reducing the chance of a break or malfunction.
As with any wireless device, H2know must be certified to meet all FCC specifications.
Although we design and test to these specifications, when H2know is sent off to the certifying lab, any issues that arise during these tests may lead to design changes. In this event, these issues will be addressed before delivery as quickly as possible and as close to the projected timeline as possible.The AppThe success of the device relies on our proprietary machine-learning software and approach that we have developed at Conservation Labs.
The approach is continuously improving as we test and collect more data.
Our key team members working on the machine learning approach each have over 25 years of experience solving large, complex challenges with data science.
The current version of H2know is fully functional: from the device, to water flow estimates, to reporting.
Conservation Labs recognizes that the H2know™ device and app may require additional testing, hardware adjustments, software engineering, industrial design checks. Any changes to the device will be followed by further testing before manufacturing and delivery. How do you install H2know? There are three steps: (1) Connect the device to your WiFi. (2) Attach the device to your water pipe and plug it in. (3) Install the app. Where do you install H2know? 
 
The H2know sensor attaches over your water pipe in an indoor area of your house with access to an electrical outlet and WiFi connection.
More specifically, H2know attaches to your water pipe on the house side of the meter on the main pipe that “feeds the house” before it branches into sections. If your water meter is located outside of the house (e.g., in a meter pit), then you will attach it to the main pipe as it enters the home.
If you do not have a meter, H2know attaches to your water pipe on the house side of the pump or other systems for moving and cleaning water.
 
 What type of pipe does H2know work with? At launch, H2know is optimized for ¾ inch copper. We will add additional material and sizes after the initial product launch. Are there additional requirements that I should be aware of? Since H2know transmits data through your WiFi, the location of the device must be in range of your WiFi. You will also need access to an electric outlet. How does H2know work? 
 
H2know consists of a sensor device and an app.
The device takes many measurements from the pipe every second. These measurements are transformed into a second-level water flow estimate. Our team of mathematicians and engineers designed a proprietary machine learning approach to transform low-cost sensor data to insights including: accurate water flow estimates, categorization of water use, identification of leaks and burst pipes, identification of specific leaking appliances, and custom conservation recommendations.
The app delivers water usage and alerts in an easy-to-use and understandable interface.
 
 Is there an ongoing fee? 
 
We are planning a zero-cost service that provides water use by the day as well as real-time leak and burst pipe alerts. More advanced features will be available through a nominal subscription fee. These features include categorization of water use (e.g., by appliance), water use down to the hour or minute, identification of the location of the leak, custom conservation recommendations, and custom DIY tips and recommendations. We are planning features beyond these, stay tuned!
 
 Will H2know shut off my water? 
 
H2know is a monitoring-only device. However, we are already working on a companion device that will automatically or remotely shut off water based on user configurations.
 
 How does H2know save me money? 
 
There are several studies that examine the impact of leaks in homes and the impact of metering. Studies by the EPA and USGS indicate that as much as 15% of the average homeowner’s water use is attributed to leaks. Other studies demonstrate the presence of a monthly-read meter can reduce water consumption by 5-30%. Analysis of U.S. consumption behaviors suggest there is a 20% reduction opportunity for homeowners by improving water habits. The conclusion is that a device like H2know can help save the average U.S. homeowner $250 in water-related expenses every year.
In addition, a plumbing leak or burst pipe is the most common non-weather related home insurance claim. There are various studies on this topic, we use the mid-range estimates of 1 million insurance claims at an average of $10,000 per claim. This means the average home has a 1 in 75 chance of a catastrophic leak this year and every year. We want to put an end to those leaks and give you peace of mind.
 
 How does H2know help the environment? 
 
The sum of leaks and unwanted use across all homes in the U.S. is a staggering 2 trillion gallons of water. That is enough water to meet the needs of homes in our 50 largest cities for an entire year. Access to clean water and the infrastructure to deliver that water is increasingly stressed and puts demands on the environment. In addition, water conveyance (moving water from its source to the home to sewage treatment) is one of the leading consumers of energy. The energy consumption on leaks and unwanted water usage alone produces an estimated 3.7 million MT Tons of CO2 every year.
Conservation Labs was one of the winners of the inaugural CES Climate Change Innovator Awards for our ability to demonstrate a reduction greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions if H2know is widely implemented.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

Because now it is.    Pepper Your Steak In 7 Cranks Instead of 70  What Others Say:  10X The Output of Top-Rated Mills Speed:  At up to 10x the output of top-rated pepper mills, the Pepper cannon produces extravagant quantities of fresh ground pepper.  You may briefly think ""That's too much pepper"" when you first use your new Pepper Cannon.  Don't be alarmed, this is normal.   Simply decrease the coarseness until the output is merely excessive, pepper your eggs with 1/2 crank instead of 5 cranks, and with your extra time cure cancer and give your partner proper lovin'. More work for inconsistent results OR less work for better results? Hmmm...
  
Love pepper? Go ahead and add a FULL crank, you animal you.
 3 cranks per side is better than 30.
 60 seconds of cranking with an ordinary mill, OR 6 seconds with a Pepper Cannon?
 Okay, okay-we get it. No, that's not even close to the highest setting. Yes, I did eat that egg.  More Grind Options  Ordinary pepper mills are capable of producing pepper in the 12-28 mesh size range.   The Pepper Cannon can grind from 8 to over 60 mesh, producing pepper coarse enough for stocks and roast beef, and finer than the pepper you buy pre-ground because your old mill can't grind fine enough.  World-class Grind Quality  Traditional pepper mills use wobbly drive shafts that turn an undersized self-dulling burr.   The male and female burrs grind against each other (which is way less fun than it sounds) resulting in dull, chipped burr teeth and allowing larger than desired pepper particles to pass.   Inconsistent pepper grinds? You may be suffering from wobbly bits.
 The Pepper Cannon uses a heavy double-bearing supported drive shaft to power wicked-sharp burrs made of high-carbon stainless steel forged in the fires of Mount Yougetthepoint.  With the Pepper Cannon, you can grind everything from pixie-dust-fine-powder up to cracked pepper in seconds. Grind pepper, not teeth.
 NOTE: Grind consistency is a function of maintaining equal distance between the burrs as they rotate.  As such, it is expected that pepper particles smaller than the grind setting will pass through while larger particles will not.  So, a consistent grind means that no particles larger than a certain size will pass.  The stabilized drive shaft and precision burrs on the Pepper Cannon make it so.  Superior Consistency The traditional method of placing a rotating grind adjuster in direct contact with a rotating top is a recipe for wildly inconsistent ground pepper. The grind adjuster on the Pepper Cannon is on the base and uses dual spring-plungers and detents so it won't move unless you move it.    Make on-the-fly grind adjustments quickly and easily and rest assured the grind adjuster will stay where you set it.  Effortless Filling Having to remove the adjustment nut, remove the top, replace the top, replace the adjustment nut and recalibrate your pepper mill every time you refill it is not awesome.   The Pepper Cannon features a top that pops off with the push of a button for easy filling then presses back into place with a satisfying ""Click"".     The Bloody Hand Conundrum: Solved You've seasoned meat on one side, now what?  You've got to flip the meat over and season the other side, which means you'll either have to wash your hands mid-seasoning OR handle your pepper mill with a bloody hand. We've all been there. Don't let this inconvenience force you into using inferior pre-ground pepper. The MÄNNKITCHEN pepper mill features a removable base cup. 1/4 twist when removing & replacing the cup makes it easy. You can use the Pepper Cannon without the cup in normal operation, or you can grind up to 1/3 cup before you start handling meat, then sprinkle it directly from the cup when one-handed peppering is preferable.Grind a bunch into the cup, then pepper all at once. Superior Build Quality + Materials The MÄNNKITCHEN Pepper Cannon body is milled from a solid chunk of Aerospace Grade Aluminum and then anodized black to make the surface durable, non-reactive, and easy to clean. 
Not plastic:   Plastic breaks and deforms easily.
Not wood:   Wood retains moisture.
Not glass:  Glass shatters and allows light to degrade pepper.
  Metal construction allows us to achieve the very strict tolerances required for precision parts to produce exceptional results while adding strength and durability.  Burrs are made of hardened high-carbon stainless steel.
 Milling from a sold chunk of metal is not the way to make a cheap pepper mill, it's the way to make the best pepper mill.   Precision Engineering The Pepper Cannon is precision engineered to produce the widest range of ground pepper at the fastest speed.  It's a quantum leap forward in pepper milling.  Rewards Backers will get $40 OFF the Pepper Cannon plus FREE shipping anywhere in the USA. Backers outside the USA will pay a flat $22 for shipping (even if you order multiple units). The Pepper Cannon outperforms high priced mills in more than just speed, consistency, and grind options: There are many pepper mills that cost more than the Pepper Cannon, but In almost every case the high price is the result of form rather than function:
Super tall
Exotic materials
Famous designer/brand names
Unusual shapes
 Every decision in the creation of the Pepper Cannon was driven by function: 
High output
Maximum grind range
Consistent grind quality
Super durable
Easy to use/refill/calibrate
Low center of gravity for stability
 Does the Pepper Cannon look like a million bucks?  Of course it does.  It performs even better.     Sustainable Materials  Aluminum is the most abundant metal on planet Earth, is 100% recyclable, and can be recycled indefinitely. The pepper cannon body, top, and base cup are made from recycled Aerospace grade aluminum with anodized black exterior.  One Last Testimonial:   Things you can buy today for $159:

 Oops, Here's Another Testimonial: Sorry, this just keeps happening: Frequently Asked Questions Why build the pepper cannon?We were tired of using stale and inferior pre-ground pepper because existing mills are slow, and we were tired of cranking ordinary pepper mills an excessive number of times to get small amounts of inconsistently ground pepper.  Maybe you are tired of those things too.When you see top chefs using premium mills crank over 60 times for a simple dish, it means there's an opportunity to improve the experience.Once we started working on the speed problem, it became apparent that other problems like filling, calibrating, and grind quality/range were also fixable.  We've ground pepper one way for so long that we're used to it, but now there's a better option.  Why call it the Pepper Cannon?Two reasons.Reason 1: The more comparisons we did between our prototypes and top-rated pepper mills, the more it was apparent that there was no comparison.  The Pepper Cannon is a different animal, so it gets a different name.Reason 2: It's difficult to be upset when a product called the ""Pepper Cannon"" puts out a lot of pepper.  With a name like Pepper Cannon, you know exactly what to expect.  Is the pepper cannon REALLY  better?  What difference does it really make?For professional cooks, it means better food made faster.For pepper lovers, it means finally getting the amount of pepper you want.It's the difference between using fresh ground and musty pre-ground pepper. It's using 15 cranks to pepper a side of brisket instead of 150.  It's the ability to get super fine and super coarse pepper from one device, in seconds.It's the only pepper mill that will prompt you to say ""Whoa"" when you use it. But, will there be too much pepper?No.  There will be the exact amount of pepper you want, ground more consistently, in a fraction of the time.If you want to decrease the output, either crank it less or adjust the pepper cannon to a finer setting.* Unless you dial the pepper cannon wide open.  Then there may be too much pepper.  Use your new pepper power wisely.  Does the Pepper Cannon put out a lot of pepper at all settings?No, the finer the grind, the less pepper comes out.  You can adjust the Pepper Cannon so fine that pepper stops coming out completely. We call this setting ""invisibly fine"" or ""inert iocane powder"".   Why do you endorse the grind & shake method?Every pepper mill can drop remnants of pepper after grinding when you set it down.   After grinding, give the Pepper Cannon (or any other pepper mill) one shake above whatever you're seasoning before putting it down.This helps prevent wasting pepper and leaving pepper where you don't want it.  Will I have to refill my Pepper Cannon frequently?That depends on your use. The Cannon holds a half cup of peppercorns, which is generous but not excessive.  It's best to store peppercorns in a sealed container to prolong freshness, so we opted against a super large reservoir (and corresponding height) that would take home users a long time to empty.Plus the Pepper Cannon is so easy to refill that it's no longer a chore.  Pop the top, pour in fresh peppercorns, and click the top back on.  No need to remove, replace, and recalibrate the Pepper Cannon just to refill it.  Will the Pepper Cannon come pre-filled with peppercorns?The Pepper Cannon will ship empty, but we're researching options to include high-quality peppercorns as an add-on (in a separate sealed container) after the campaign ends. We hope to source various peppercorn varieties from multiple locations around the globe so you have an amazing selection of the World's best pepper to go with your favorite new seasoning machine.   If you wholesale fresh organic peppercorns, email info AT mannkitchen DOT com.  Can I grind red peppercorns, and white peppercorns, and green peppercorns, and coffee, and cloves, and fennel, and anise, and coriander in it?Yes.You should get one Pepper Cannon for each of those things though, or your coffee will taste extra bold & special. Will the Pepper Cannon be available in different colors?  I want one for each spice!Currently, to minimize costs and simplify fulfillment the Cannon will only be available in black. We're looking at the possibility of adding silicon sleeves and/or extra tops of differing colors down the road. How do I clean my Pepper Cannon?Wipe the exterior with a warm damp cloth or paper towel.  It is recommended to keep the interior of the Pepper Cannon dry.  If you must wash it, be certain to dry the interior thoroughly before refilling as it uses dry bearings, and they need to be kept dry.Do not put the Pepper Cannon in the dishwasher. What if I don’t like pepper?Purchase a Pepper Cannon to give away to someone who loves cooking. Right now you're thinking of someone who would love this.  Get one for them.  But, I’m satisfied with my existing pepper mill, aren’t I?Remember when you used to get up early to harness your horses to the carriage and the horses would poop so much-and it was everywhere?  And then you got a Tesla?  Replacing your pepper mill with a Pepper Cannon is like that. You won’t want to go back to the old way. Isn’t $199 expensive for a pepper mill?Yes, it is.  And a new car is expensive compared to a bicycle.The Pepper Cannon was engineered and built for performance and it performs exceptionally well.  We could have made it less expensively, but it wouldn't be the same quality.Hopefully one day we'll be able to order material in enough quantity to bring the cost within reach of more people because no one should have to continue grinding pepper the old way.That said, the Pepper Cannon will never be as inexpensive as ordinary mills because there's nothing ordinary about it.Also, backers will get $40 OFF + FREE Shipping to all US locations!  Will you ship outside the US?Yes, flat rate USPS shipping outside the US is $22.  Shipping stays at $22 even if you order multiple units.  If I'm outside the US, will I have to pay taxes and duties?Taxes and duties differ between countries, but if your jurisdiction taxes goods shipped internationally, yes you will have to pay them when your Cannon arrives.    Can I grind Salt in it?No, salt will corrode even stainless steel eventually.  Plus, inside each salt crystal is… more salt!  It doesn’t have any added flavor/aroma qualities that are improved by grinding, and it doesn’t degrade like pepper when pre-ground.  A salt shaker (or box, or bowl) with the size salt you want is fine, unlike a pepper shaker, which is a crime against flavor.     Will there be a salt grinder? Salt and steel don't always play well together for prolonged periods, so a salt mill would require ceramic burrs and other internal changes.  We anticipate less demand for a premium salt mill because grinding salt fresh does not change the flavor/aroma, only the texture.    But I like cranking my pepper mill many, many times every time I eat.That’s not a question.     What's the downside of the Pepper Cannon? It can't be all sunshine and butterflies...You'll probably go through more pepper. Also, the Pepper Cannon grinds more peppercorns at once so it requires more force to turn than ordinary mills at some settings.Oh, and dinner guests will try and steal it.  What does MÄNNKITCHEN mean?Männ is old Norse for “my”, so männkitchen means ""my kitchen"".  So, in a way-my kitchen is your kitchen, and your kitchen is my kitchen!  Which reminds me- you're out of cheese.  Who are you?I’m a guy who cooks a lot and appreciates kitchen tools that work exceptionally well. My background is in design, and I enjoy short walks on the beach.  Did your Mom really say you were a difficult child?Not out loud within my hearing.  Yet.  Yes, the other testimonials are real.   What if you take my money and run?I understand that running adds years to your life, but all those years are spent running. Plus I'm still working on my ""before"" picture. We had a successful crowdfunding campaign for the MK9 chef knife last year that was delivered on-time and got rave reviews, and that was way more fun than running. *I reserve the right to engage in non-running activities with your money.Like flying.  And skipping. Ok, so can you actually deliver?Yes. The Pepper Cannon has been in the works for over 2 years.  We have working prototypes in the hands of amazing cooks right now, and we have manufacturing partners ready to get to work.If there are unexpected delays, we will be transparent throughout the process and offer the option of a full refund to those who decide not to wait.  Why would anyone need a pepper cannon?Professional kitchens need it to save time and increase the consistency/quality of their black pepper.  You need it for the same reasons, plus to prompt envy in dinner guests.  I’m against firearms, is a pepper cannon a violation of my moral code?Yes, but in the best way possible.  I’m from England where firearms are illegal, and even pointy objects are coming under increasing government scrutiny.  Can I still get one?Absolutely!  Is the Pepper Cannon loud?It is the quietest cannon we've tested.  Is the Pepper Cannon better than a pepper shaker?The Pepper Cannon is better than a pepper shaker in the same way that eating your favorite meal is better than a mouthful of cat litter.   Why aluminum?Building it out of metal enables us to machine precision parts that fit together with exact tolerances so the results are consistent and fast. Also, aluminum is the most plentiful metal on Earth, is the easiest to recycle, and can be recycled again and again, indefinitely.   Do people really like me, or do they just come over because I have a Pepper Cannon?They really like you. Aaaand the Pepper Cannon helps.  What should I do with my old pepper mill?  Looking at it brings back unpleasant memories…Forgive your old pepper mill.  It served you as best it could.     Why didn’t you make this years ago?I know, right? We tried for 2 years and it took longer than expected to get the details right.  Share this link with someone who could use it! https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pepper-cannon-the-pepper-mill-for-pepper-lovers/x/22555573#/ Not awkward.

<p>TWIC has one purpose, we want to show everyone that we should connect apps

<p>But
to do so, first we have to make a much smaller beginning/start.</p>
<p>We
think most of us are using standard applications such as mail,

way of connected apps through a two way connection could be like.</p>
<p>For
every app a short introduction:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1231219/files/20150218094059-svg_1517139x902.svg?1424281259"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>                                                                                                           </p><br/><p></p>

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><b>What platforms does TWIC work with?</b></p>
<p>TWIC is going to be developed for Android first. The reason for that: most users use Android. As soon as possible, we're going to add iOS.</p>
<p><b>Does TWIC work for my Android phone as well as tablet?</b></p>
<p>First, it'll only be available for phones. We thought about where it's most useful for everyone; we decided phones are more important because you take it with you where ever you are. Of course the two way connection is also very useful for tablets but to provide the best user experience we can only do one at the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Why do you start this project with Cro</b><b>w</b><b>dfunding?</b></p>
<p>We love sharing ideas and Indiegogo is a great platform for doing so. We hope that you and all others who see our project share it because we believe that it can change the world of apps.</p>
<p><b>If TWIC strikes a deal with an OEM, what will happen to the software? Will everything be cancelled?</b></p>
<p>Our mission is not just to build this app. We want software and especially apps to get connected. If an OEM has the same view, we'll do whatever we can to succeed in our mission. But that doesn't mean that we won't build those apps, the money we get will be used for building them. But of course we always have to look if the market is about to change, if someone is doing the same as we do. We'll let you know if our schedule is changing.</p>
<p><b>I pledge 5$, what will happen when the App is available?</b></p>
<p>As soon as the app is available, you'll get access.</p>
<p><b>What kind of language support will there be?</b></p>
<p>Even though english is priority number 1, we do have plans to offer TWIC in other languages too.</p>
<p><b>Can I be involved in testing or translating?</b></p>
<p>Surely you can, just send us a mail and we'll inform you.</p>

You can access functions not included in the app you are in without leaving the current one
No annoying detour by exiting one app to access another anymore
Help-Icon provides help wherever you are
TWIC-apps should replace pre-installed apps
An API is going to allow other developers to use the two way connection to make their apps more efficient and enlarge our network

TWIC will be released on Android first

WHO WE ARE:We are two students
(Jonathan Michel, Patrice Becker) from Frankfurt, Germany.


  


WHAT WE DO:We’ve
been working on this project for nearly a year. There have been ups
and downs but finally we're able to present you an idea which makes

lives, we can make connections where we think there is none. It's

MORE SOLUTIONS THROUGH TWO WAY CONNECTION:Two
way connection includes
that you have access to different things in different ways - Like you
have it in real life. You have more solutions to go there in
whichever way you want to.                       







SEARCH & HELP SYMBOL:



You get help where
you need it.
On every screen
you'll find a search and a help symbol to guide you when you don't
know what to do.







OUR DREA IS ONE FOR ALL:





One
app for all and someday even an app for everything. The two way
connection starts a new generation of apps. It will show us the way;
let's realize our dream with your help!




OUR SCHEDULE IF EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE LIKE WE HOPE:





We did a cost estimate before starting this project. Asking several companies,  every cost estimate we got was around €80,000-120,000.
So we've chosen the amount in between that range.
After helping us the get the required money, we wanted to do everything with a company we trust and which seems to fulfil everything for the amount we received.
The dream of connected apps we are currently realizing includes offering our new technologies to other app developers, with other apps we can simplify your workflow even more and enlarge the network of apps we already have.
To do so, we want to offer a documented, easily usable API, which can be implemented by any developer and provides them everything to be a part of it.

The Beta should be finished in the fourth quarter of 2015.

We love sharing ideas and Indiegogo is a great platform for doing so. We hope that you and all others who see our project share it because we believe that it can change the world of apps.
If TWIC strikes a deal with an OEM, what will happen to the software? Will everything be cancelled?
Our mission is not just to build this app. We want software and especially apps to get connected. If an OEM has the same view, we'll do whatever we can to succeed in our mission. But that doesn't mean that we won't build those apps, the money we get will be used for building them. But of course we always have to look if the market is about to change, if someone is doing the same as we do. We'll let you know if our schedule is changing.
I pledge 5$, what will happen when the App is available?
As soon as the app is available, you'll get access.
What kind of language support will there be?
Even though english is priority number 1, we do have plans to offer TWIC in other languages too.
Can I be involved in testing or translating?
Surely you can, just send us a mail and we'll inform you.

<p><b>WHAT WE NEED?</b></p>
<p>Goal of our project is to accumulate an adequate amount of money to promote and start mass production for our iBiomech project. Why 5000 € ? Because we don't have it... but seriously...we don't have it. Ok, do the point:</p>
<p>First of all, to buy finest materials that will ensure the highest quality of products. In addition to this - the relevant promotion that will allow entering with product to the wider market, presenting him to as many people as we can.  Something else?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432730538/hsbwraodtyuq6pfjguyo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Of course ... to make the production faster and the product better we need more precise tools. Better CNC router, saws, paints. Thats only a tip of an iceberg. Other important things? Yes... But not for 5K... Unless we manage to exceed our main goal. </p>
<p>Without a relatively large inventory on hand, successful e-commerce though our website is unrealistic. With the capital raised during this campaign, we will re invest into new equipment, develop new products and build inventory to sell through our website. </p>
<p><b>Can we do it? Can you help? :) </b></p>

<p><b>SOME HIGHLIGHTS:</b></p>
<p><b>- FINEST WOOD: </b>Each lamp is made individually from high quality Polish wood. <br/>No lamp is exactly the same.</p>
<p><b>- STYLISH &amp; UNIQUE: </b>Our lamps were made to fit right in with the latest design trends, while at the same time, stand out from all the other out there. </p>
<p><b>- ORIGINAL DESIGN: </b>Lamps are 100% designed by us. Our vision how a cool lamp should look like.</p>
<p>- <b>HAND-MADE:</b> Although some parts are cut by our CNC router, most of the work is done by our own hands. Grinding, painting, assembling - it is all handmade.</p>

It all started about a year ago. We wanted to find a perfect gift for our friends wedding. The goal was clear - a steampunk lamp. After weeks of searching we've decided. We need to do this by our own!  



Our journey begun!  
iBiomech is the result of months of studying and experimenting with different designs and optimal construction methods for developing the best possible product. The final result is better then we ever imagine. 
When we decided to establish a brand to represent our craft, it was important that every aspect of design and construction was held to the highest standard of quality. Made from the best quality materials, strongest wood and tons of creativity and imagination this extraordinary lamp will make every space look better. 





WHAT WE NEED?
Goal of our project is to accumulate an adequate amount of money to promote and start mass production for our iBiomech project. Why 5000 € ? Because we don't have it... but seriously...we don't have it. Ok, do the point:
First of all, to buy finest materials that will ensure the highest quality of products. In addition to this - the relevant promotion that will allow entering with product to the wider market, presenting him to as many people as we can.  Something else?



Of course ... to make the production faster and the product better we need more precise tools. Better CNC router, saws, paints. Thats only a tip of an iceberg. Other important things? Yes... But not for 5K... Unless we manage to exceed our main goal. 
Without a relatively large inventory on hand, successful e-commerce though our website is unrealistic. With the capital raised during this campaign, we will re invest into new equipment, develop new products and build inventory to sell through our website. 
Can we do it? Can you help? :) 





SOME HIGHLIGHTS:
- FINEST WOOD: Each lamp is made individually from high quality Polish wood. No lamp is exactly the same.
- STYLISH & UNIQUE: Our lamps were made to fit right in with the latest design trends, while at the same time, stand out from all the other out there. 
- ORIGINAL DESIGN: Lamps are 100% designed by us. Our vision how a cool lamp should look like.
- HAND-MADE: Although some parts are cut by our CNC router, most of the work is done by our own hands. Grinding, painting, assembling - it is all handmade.



WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP?
- buying materials ( best / finest )
- promotional purposes
- better, more precise tools & equipment
- to face unexpectable production  challenges

8. Your iBiomech



New, original project made only for You and with You. We will design and make a lamp, including all your suggestion, guidance and desires. You want to have a beautiful thing that will be envied by all your friends? That's the right choice :-)


TIME LINE







3 guys, crazy idea and a lot of passion.  This is us, and we're proud to be here! 






 Born 1982. A self-taught master of artistic composition in wood. CNC routers specialist. Without him, no project could come to life. Thanks to him, the final version of the concept becomes better than any assumptions. A real workaholic.


 Head designer and father of iBiomech project.PhD student, Faculty of Maritime Technology at the West Pomeranian University of Technology. Co-founder and member of „Lake of the Crown of the World” expedition, which is known for 2 world records for diving in the mountain lakes.Professional diver – III class. Equipment specialist. 


 Born 1985. The guy from the clip :) Second designer. Man who initiated all this madness.  PR and Social Media Ninja.  He don't know to much about woodworking but fair enough to by a smart-ass. A real fan of terrible music and even more terrible movies. 




DESIGN PROCESS
In the design process, the very first step was the idea of a shape through sketches. We've tried to make the first model as cool and attractive as it ever could be.


In the second stage, the model was transferred into a 3d model and we could focus on new functionalities.


In the third stage several physical hand-made prototypes were made for testing and improving the features.

After evaluating the proper changes our first final model called iBiomech 1.01 . We will not show it to you - we are bored with it :-)

Few months later, after a lot of thinking, improving and argueing we came up with three new lamps, that really makes us proud. Meet iBiomech Mini, Tripod and ONE :)


 







Getting a new product to market can be a difficult process and unfortunately delays can happen due to unforeseen circumstances. Facing mass production for the first time can by challenging. We have taken every precaution to make sure our lamps meet strict quality standards.

We anticipate a production timeline of 8 weeks after reaching our goal, and then a shipping timeline of 6 weeks (max), which includes preparing the shipments. The time of shipment should not exceed 6 weeks, but will depend where the perk will be send.

We are confident with this timing, plus or minus a few weeks. We have managed out the unknowns to the best of our abilities, but as people who care deeply about our product and reputation, we will communicate with you throughout the process so that you know exactly when to expect your shipment.
We promise to do our best to make sure that everything is done efficiently and effectively. We are excited to bring iBiomech lamps to life. Thank you for your support!    Other Ways You Can Help

<p>EIOS is the first insulation in the world that offers a cladding and finishing system that completely eliminates the condensation phenomenon in the building envelope (the exterior walls of every building that separate the interior conditioned space from the exterior environment) by applying in practice a new concept of creating Vapor-Impermeable Insulation Systems, called Non-Permissive Insulations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528753432/dsf55st4fjirdyggzzeg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>EIOS is made out of high-quality Extruded Polystyrene XPS with joints invented for double-sealing with polyurethane foam and an over-sealing with polymer material. The XPS is a vapor-impermeable insulation material. By vapor sealing all joints and intersections with other objects (windows, doors, etc.), we create a vapor-impermeable insulation assembly, the Non-Permissive Insulation.</p>
<p>Condensation is avoided when vapors are prevented from passing through an insulation assembly that has been applied to an enclosure that separates two environments with different temperatures.</p>
<p>The basic theory of this new concept is expressed by the newly discovered Principle of Avoiding Condensation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529363217/xlijq3or6kmaottufjf9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>From ancient times when people started building shelters until the present, construction has been done in the same way – with the idea of controlling unwanted factors such water, air, vapors, and thermal flow. This EIOS campaign will change this field though.</p>
<p>Contemporary construction has been relatively successful in controlling water, air, and thermal flow in the building envelope. However, the vapor control, dew point and condensation in the envelope walls have left builders in a precarious position. </p>
<p>The current type of design and construction of envelope walls attempts to control moisture by reducing condensation and by creating the possibility for the walls to dry out. Some of the techniques used include leaving intentional airflow through the walls, utilizing drainage plans, and providing ventilation of the insulation.</p>
<p>While the Moisture Control concept is based on cycles of wetting and drying from season to season and makes use of vapor barriers, the Moisture Free concept is based on the complete elimination of the condensation phenomenon by creating Non-Permissive Insulations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529407820/xb9kvtj8gek3p6mopxw9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The majority of people think that the actual design and realization of envelope walls is based on Avoiding the Condensation Phenomenon, but in reality it is based on Moisture Control and Managing Condensation by applying water/air/vapor barriers, creating drainage planes, and ventilation of walls.<br/>The functioning of an envelope wall is based on cycles of wetting and drying, by accumulating humidity from condensation when the inside-outside temperature differences apply and by naturally drying the walls. The wetting of the envelope walls occurs when the inside of a structure is heated because of the outdoor colder temperatures.  It also happens when a building is cooled inside, and the outside environment is hot and humid. In cold or hot/humid climates, the heating and cooling of a building is virtually all four seasons, with only short periods of time when air/vapor driving forces are not applied to the wall. This cumulative, short period of time when condensation does not occur is just not enough time to dry the water accumulated, mainly due to the air/vapor barrier layers applied. The consequence is the occurrence of dampness, mold, and degradation such as wood rot and corrosion.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516111478/ccocnph00ffxon0ic7sc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In regular continental climates, the quantity of condensation water accumulated in a cold season (90 days) is about 1 lbs/ft² (3-6 kg/m²) and dries in 80-160 days, meaning a cycle of water accumulation and drying.</p>
<p>In cold or hot climates, the quantity of water can easily double, the wetting period increases, the drying necessary time exceeds the period of the drying season, and moisture accumulates.</p>
<p>The consequence is well known: the beginning of interstitial (in the wall) mold grown, degradation of indoor air quality, fast decay of envelope walls, expensive repairs and lowering of property value.</p>

<p><i>Each of us lives in a house or building that must maintain a comfortable temperature and humidity level. Those conditions create differences of temperatures and relative humidity which in turn generates driving forces for energy flow and air/vapor movement. Temperature differences also generate dew point and condensation with the related consequences resulting in mold and degradation.<br/>While the energy flow can be slowed down by adding real insulation value, the condensation phenomenon had no solution before the invention of the Principle of Avoiding Condensation.</i></p>

<p><strong><i>A New Principle of Technology which enables the design of envelope walls without condensation.</i></strong></p>
<p>One of the goals of this campaign is to share this new technical principle with the world. This allows builders to construct building enclosures that have completely eliminated the condensation phenomenon, the cycles of wetting and drying, mold, and degradation within envelope walls.</p>
<div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_QXw1BCZ2A?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div></div>

<p>People involved in construction can attest to the fact that, when it comes to vapor transfer, condensation, mold, and consequences our actual prescriptive requirements for moisture control depend on the “vapor diffusion paradigm” and not on scientists’ default and reproducible experiments.                                            </p>
<p>The actual fundamental principle to control water in vapor form is to keep it out and to let it out if it happens to gets into the wall. Another common principle is to encourage drying mechanisms over wetting prevention mechanisms. This gets complicated because sometimes the best strategies to keep water vapor out actually end up trapping water vapor in, plus varying climates and seasons make this even more complicated. If using these principles, there needs to be different strategies for different climates. There also has to be consideration for the differences between summer and winter if following this principle, but this is rather impossible.</p>
<p>All these stipulations lead to legitimate question:</p>
<p>Is there a situation, configuration, or assembly that could avoid the condensation completely despite the climate or season? Can we have a general rule to use as a principle to avoid condensation in building enclosures and other such enclosures?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>YES</strong>, and it makes the object of the new theory of Non-Permissive Insulation. The Principle of Avoiding Condensation can be formulated, understood, and used in designing and constructing enclosures. The value of this principle is obvious.</p>
<p>As a basic fundamental of science, the Principle of Avoiding Condensation is defined as:</p>
<p><strong>When there is a temperature difference and an enclosure is interposed between the high interior temperature and the low exterior temperature (or vice versa), in order to avoid condensation, the heat flow needs to convert the cold flow in an insulation material or in a thermo-insulation assembly without vapor diffusion or any air/vapor flow that carries warm vapor towards cold areas.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516367321/rcper8ynemy5xtwyk7rn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After a deep understanding of the phenomenology and configuration of Vapor Impermeable Insulation or Non-Permeable Insulation Assemblies, the Principle of Avoiding Condensation can have a simple definition:</p>
<p><strong>The condensation is avoided when the heat flow converts the cold flow in a Vapor Impermeable Insulation or a Non-Permissive Insulation Assembly. </strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://eios.co/principles-of-avoiding-condensation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://eios.co/principles-of-avoiding-condensa...</a></p>
<p>Be the first to read, understand, support, and implement this theory – it will change the thinking of how to construct walls and buildings.</p>
<p><strong><i>So, the philosophy of this new Principle is that heat has to meet the cold in an insulation material or system without the presence of any vapors. By achieving this, the warm environment is ""stopped"" on the warm surface of the insulation, which is a condensation-free plane, because is in a dew-point free area.</i></strong></p>
<p><img alt=""GIF-265b49.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/GIF-265b49.gif"" src=""""/>  </p>
<p>By applying this theory in practice, the engineer Marius Radoane invented a Thermal Insulation and Finishing System which eliminates all problems of condensation, intruding or absorbed water, and in certain situations, the wall that receives this system dries to an unexpected humidity level, by simply applying a difference of temperature. This revolutionary design was first called “Non-Permissive Exterior Insulation and Finishing System (NP-EIFS)” and was invented as an integrated Concept, Technology, and Details to function in all real construction situations.</p>
<p>The actual promoters of wall systems teach us that a 30-40% humidity in the wood frame and drywall is normal. However these buildings have a short lifespan and lots of problems.</p>
<p><strong>By applying the Principle of Avoiding Condensation materialized in the Design Technology to Eliminate Condensation we created EIOS (Exterior Insulation Over Specified). We bring to the world the first high insulated wall system that dries and stays dry in all environmental situations, providing an alternative to the breathing, wetting, and energy flow walls.</strong></p>
<p>A new age of high-performance building envelope starts with the Principle of Avoiding Condensation, the theory of Non-Permissive Insulation, to which all can benefit.</p>

<p>We are proud to introduce the first insulation and finish system that completely eliminates the condensation phenomenon on envelope walls. This is an integral solution to clad and insulate a building that guarantees permanently dry walls, no dampness, mold, fungi or degradation, as well as thermal efficiency Real R-value equal to the specified value of the insulation materials used.</p>

<p>The Zero Condensation Concept is the idea of eliminating the condensation phenomenon and intruding water. It also solves the problem of decreasing the specified thermal efficiency of insulation materials and/or partially applying the insulation value to envelope walls. All these things are only possible by applying the Principle of Avoiding Condensation and the theory of Non-Permissive Insulation.</p>
<p>Technology is created to achieve the Concept Goal. Regardless of how good a technology is, and what performance products uses, if the Concept does not stand up, the product results will fails.</p>
<p>A good cladding technology will also fail if the details of intersections with other constructive elements are deficient and not in accordance with the concept goal.</p>
<p>EIOS Technology provides insulation and triple sealing of every joint of insulation boards and intersection with other construction elements such as windows, doors, and other openings on the structure’s interior facing towards the exterior.</p>

<p>We consider it imperative to apply the same concept used for walls to the roof or ceiling in order to complete the thermal envelope. Roofs and ceilings, especially for low-race buildings and houses, are the most exposed part of the building to vapor flow, air leakage, and hot and cold flow.</p>
<p>For this reason, we always connect the environmental separator EIOS for walls with the environmental separator EIOS for roofs or ceilings.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516368190/cayprmots2lpqayhiary.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>EIOS Thermosystem is created by assembling air/vapor impermeable extruded polystyrene XPS boards, invented to create two sealing joints. These joints allows sealing two times with closed-cell expandable polyurethane foam.</p>
<p><img alt=""GIFEIOSSealboard.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/GIFEIOSSealboard.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The whole assembly (including intersections with other constructive elements such windows, doors, penetrations, and terminations) will be over-sealed with a special formula of polymer-based sealant material to ensure that no vapor can diffuse through the Thermosystem.</p>
<center><img alt=""EIOSAssembly.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/EIOSAssembly.gif"" src=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>A strong and durable reinforcing layer called Lamina is applied over the Vapor-Impermeable Insulation Assembly.  On the Lamina is applied the finishing coat with a desired texture and color to complete the EIOS System.</p>
<p>The envelope wall can be this simple.  Because of its Non-Permissive features, it will achieve the thermal efficiency of complicated, double-layered, expensive, moisture-controlled walls.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516276332/c7m9esjiobzhqy0fmi6l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The starter-track is sealed to the structure and creates a strong and anti-termite band on the foundation of the construction. The anti-termite band eliminates the usually costly repair needed within a few years of construction because of termite infestation.  Most common types are against the code requirements of drainage and ventilation of the cladding or exterior insulation (drainage and ventilation means a bottom provided opening to the exterior for water to drain and for air intake).</p>
<p>EIOS Thermosystem is also very strong, and does not crack like other hard-coatings.</p>
<p>EIOS System is vital for wooden, moisture-sensitive construction with air/vapor permeability and susceptibility to dampness - timber construction, wooden structure + OSB/plywood or galvanized sheet profiles + sheetrock, and new and retrofit construction.</p>
<p><strong>By contracting EIOS during this campaign, you have a 20-year Stability, Crack-Free Warranty.</strong></p>

<h3>EIOS System Projects</h3> <p>We want to introduce you the first house built according to the Principle of Avoiding Condensation.  We periodically inspect and monitor it for moisture issues, indoor air quality, and comfort in relation to thermal efficiency.</p>
<p>The house is the dream home of a family with two children, hand crafted by wood with a wonderful spirit of natural living inside.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531184626/icsgs6uuor1623q3bmur.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The project was completed in 2013 and is located in Romania, eastern Europe (equivalent to climate zone 5 in the US).</p>
<p>The specs of the construction includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>timber exterior and interior walls, 12 cm (5 inch), no air-tightness of walls and window/doors intersections;</li>
<li>rafters, wainscot apparently on the inside and batten roof decking as roof structure, zero air-tight considered;</li>
<li>upstairs attic living space (mansard);</li>
<li>EIOS 8System and EIOS 8Sky, 8 cm (about 3 inch) Non-Permissive Insulation, R18 (US Effective R-value) as Environmental Separator;</li>
<li>EIOS 8 cm Thermosystem ground floor insulation;</li>
<li>two floors of 65 m² (700 ft²) totaling a 130 m² (1400 ft²) interior living space (without walls), enclosed by 450 m² (4850 ft²) thermal envelope (including floor);</li>
<li>triple-glazed, low-e high quality windows and doors, representing about 0.1% of the total thermal envelope.</li>
</ul>
<center><img alt=""EIOS_Timber_House.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/EIOS_Timber_House.gif"" src=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>After four years of observations of the occupied home, we conclude:</p>
<ul>
<li>the wood structure has a constant moisture content around 11%, the entire house is constantly dry with no condensation or intruding water;</li>
<li>no mold grows or other organisms developed in the wood frame and the interior still holds a pleasant smell of pine tree;</li>
<li>the heating energy use over five months during winter (equivalent to NY climate zone) is about 30 - 40 kWh/m² (2.8 - 3.7 kWh/ft²) of thermal envelope per annum, including the hot water for four people;</li>
<li>the cooling energy for the hot season is zero, the house does not have any air conditioning system on the summer. Inside temperatures slightly rise above comfort for a short period of time during the day, but only for a few days out of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p>The family living in this house is complete satisfied of its decision, very happy with the comfort and the very low costs of energy bills. They are aware that they could easily made the mistakes of regular construction. They would have ended up in an uninhabitable house in the summer without the help of cooling systems and would have increased their winter energy bills by four times. Plus they would have had to deal with the inevitable mold and fungi that lives in a traditionally-built house. </p>
<p>The family is now life-long believers in the EIOS system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522260326/qgxqi9eutmis6kpjjtdd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Soon after inventing the Non-Permissive insulation for wall systems, the inventor realized that this system should apply also for roofs in connection with the walls to complete a building enclosure.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529931058/fbnl06tic8i75httt8yp.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p>Roofs are always made out of moisture sensitive materials, are made less airtight, and are the most exposed to the vicissitudes of nature.  </p>
<p>This is why the EIOS concept branched out to EIOS Sky, the Non-Permissive insulation system for roofs in 2013.</p>
<p>The most common feature of roofs is that they have very little to no existing air tightness.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516369344/acxyppwrwyolhgozy2xw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you have the resourceful idea to have a living space in the attic instead of a cold/hot attic, you face the technical dilemma of making the roof more airtight and having moisture accumulation problems or to make in-wall ventilation that lets intentional airflow through the walls to manage moisture but ends up having very less thermal efficiency.</p>
<p>Real construction is somewhere in between, and home owners deals with exposure to toxic indoor molds and pay unreasonably high energy bills.</p>
<p>As a revolutionary solution, EIOS Sky solves all these problems with the Non-Permissive Thermosystem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516369498/h60aalrho5telituxvs4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>EIOS Sky is always Non-Permissive-connected with the exterior wall insulation such as the EIOS System. </i></p>
<p>The less-airtight roof decking is the perfect substrate for applying EIOS Sky.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516890691/gwo0ksitjuuwqlreolnq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>EIOS Sky is placed in the best location for protecting the building, which is certainly on the outside of the structure. </p>
<p>The system creates an insulation shell that eliminates in-wall condensation, drastically reduces the energy demand, and protects from water infiltration, germs, and pollutants.  This results in a reduction to or even elimination of mechanical systems (in not-extreme climates).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529934001/rtq3l4v0wklkyottdzpn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The structural element (roof frame) uses less material to build, less chemicals to protect for moisture, foils and water/air/vapor barrier is not longer used, the design requirement to accommodating in-wall insulation is eliminated, and this is also an important saving for the investor, and for our natural resources.</p>
<p>The living space can be simply created, natural and pleasant, and always dry and comfortable.</p>

<h3>EIOS Sky Projects</h3>
<p>An old building in Bucharest, Romania was remodel and has been given a new look and utility.</p>
<p>The building owner chose to convert the old cold-attic in an office space. Being aware of the moisture and cooling/heating problems that this space will face, he searched for the best solution. He found EIOS.   </p>
<p>On October 2016, the old roof framing was replaced with a new one, and EIOS settled the solution to install the environmental separator - EIOS Sky.</p>
<center><img alt=""EIOS_Sky.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/EIOS_Sky.gif"" src=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>Being a massive brick-masonry construction (with walls not sensitive to moisture) the facades ware insulated and finished with the classical face-sealed EIFS, connected with the Non-Permissive EIOS Thermosystem applied on the roof.</p>
<p>During construction and interior finishing, no-condensation water was noticed on the entire roof (regardless the high RH level). It is well known that a roof system containing vapor barrier produces some kg/m² of condensation water in the cold season. Comparing this with not-a-drop on the entire roof, the building owner feels privileged. </p>
<p>The main visible feature of the new attic was the ease in which it was heated in the winter, and the less running of air-conditioning in the summer.</p>
<p>The owner is very happy with his decision and finds the price of EIOS Sky very affordable and lower than price to build with classical insulation system and moisture control solutions.</p>
<p><i>The most preferred roof systems in association with EIOS Sky are the Tiled Roof Systems, which ensures good exterior-to-exterior ventilation and a convenient attachment system.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522260647/nj8igylgbethsveximl9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>On-the-roof insulation is not always suitable for real construction solutions and renovation purposes.</i></p>
<p>Converting an attic into a nice, comfortable living space or designing the last floor of a building to be a mansard or penthouse is very efficient for living but is also very challenging for moisture control solutions and thermal efficiency.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516905830/pkpjyeqxhhdeizfdptdq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The main characteristic of attic rooms is that it cannot be inhabited in the summer without air-conditioning and the air clogs because of mold grown in the structure.   </p>
<p>Again, EIOS expands its application domain to be the complete solution for loft conversion and mansards as well.</p>
<p>An old attic with virtually zero air-tightness and exposed to high levels of cold and heat is the perfect place to install EIOS.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516979467/ogirohcnadvbppofcpw8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The special sealing ensures a vapor-impermeable insulation and guarantees that the unlimited Zero Condensation, Moisture-Free feature is applied to the entire surface.</p>

<p>EIOS now separates the two environments - your interior living space and the exterior. The roof framing is kept in one environment where in the summer the wood is dried by the heat and in the winter will be sterilized by the cold.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516980058/c9qps023ayj8wibwlkel.jpg"" src=""""/>    </p>

<p>EIOS Thermosystem again gives you a comfortable and healthy indoor, moisture-free and incredibly thermally efficient space – all lifetime guaranteed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516892927/sfzoiemx1xe1arzzkpbu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The roof of every house or building accentuates the nobility and charm of the construction, but the attic is not always suitable for living.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516897439/bbjf8yqfqcfqwszoy70e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We strongly recommend that the living space be separated from the exterior environment by a Non-Permissive Insulation Assembly for moisture-free, high thermal-efficiency reasons. The thermal envelope of the building needs to be connected and completed with the ceiling of the living space.</p>
<p>The ceiling is the area most exposed to vapor-flow and to the thermal-flow from the interior, so a special protection is needed on this part also.</p>
<p>Today’s common practices always leaves the insulation fragmented and with zero airtight capabilities after installed, and the control layers are inexistent or difficult to be applied and very ineffective.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520499863/lt6zy4ddkjbzdy5tqaqf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In alternative, we give two options for EIOS Thermosystem applied to ceilings to cover all construction situations:</p>
<p><i>EIOS for Ceilings with Lamina for direct finishing of the surfaces</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516967292/ciaxvuygv89deriiuoje.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>In many situations, the design requires a suspended ceiling to accommodate electrical and mechanical systems.</p>
<p>Also, it is well known that the poorly performing duct system in the cold/hot attic contributes to lost energy, condensation, and mold problems of the air-ducting system. </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516898107/p1hcsut4ijes0gpr117n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We solve all those problems by applying a continuous EIOS Thermosystem as the environmental separator on the ceiling, provided with a strong attachment system for the suspended ceiling, and for other mechanical attachments.</p>

<h3>EIOS for Ceiling Projects</h3>
<p>Of the many projects EIOS has, we want to introduce you to one that we did not expect to become a reality so soon.</p>
<p>This project is an eight years old house that has been lived in for five years by a young family with two children. It was extended in 2016 with a living room and a utility room on the ground floor and a master bedroom and a closet room in the upstairs living attic.</p>
<p>The house has two more bedrooms in the attic, so the homeowner knows very well how expensive it is to live in this kind of designed construction, both in winter and in summer. Searching for the best insulation solution for the new part of the house, the owner found EIOS.</p>
<p>In December 2016 an EIOS team installed the Thermosystem on the roof-ceiling and completed it with the Lamina for plastering finishing.</p>
<center><img alt=""EIOSCeilingHouseExtension.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/EIOSCeilingHouseExtension.gif"" src=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>The extreme cold outside makes it very expensive to heat the inside, which is heated by a wooden pellets furnace.</p>
<p>After completing the EIOS on the ceiling, something unusual happened: in the extension of the house attic, the temperature inside rises above the rest of the house temperature.  This was only with the heat lost by the furnace downstairs and the insulated chimney flue that passes through the upstairs living space.</p>
<p>The homeowner made a decision: He wanted to remodel the entire house with this new concept. He wanted to have EIOS on the entire roof and ceiling.</p>
<p>In early February 2017, the drywall ceiling of the entire house was demolished and replaced with EIOS Thermosystem.</p>
<center><img alt=""EIOSCeilingRemodel.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/EIOSCeilingRemodel.gif"" src=""""/></center>

<p><strong>When it comes to insulation, few may know that the actual solutions have two major issues:</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li><strong>The vapor diffusion paradigm and moisture accumulation and</strong></li>
<li><strong>The low insulation effectiveness of R-value and air-tightness weaknesses of the building.</strong></li>

<p>The two principal issues fully resolved and associated with further EIOS advantages will give you the vision in setting goals that result in benefits.</p>
<p>Applying the Principle of Avoiding Condensation for a healthy home to design, construction, renovation and maintenance do not have to result in cost increases. By understanding the interactions between EIOS and building systems without trade-offs, cost savings combined with building improved performances, we can give a general view of how to save with EIOS Thermosystem.</p>

<p><i>Any building and home can benefit today from the design technology to eliminate condensation and the use of insulation materials in ideal conditions, for an unlimited term, at the same price as deficient or illusory insulations.</i></p>

<p><strong>The unsolved problem of moisture in the building envelope of every enclosure comes to an end.</strong><br/>By contracting EIOS for your house or building investment, you will be one of the first to own a house with zero moisture in the walls due to harm from the exterior environment.<br/>Water can get in every regular construction by vapor movement and condensation, or via direct entry. EIOS is the first construction system in the world that claims to completely eliminate this issue.   </p>
<p>We all know that every single house/building without exception contains water/air/vapor barriers in the form of foils, fabric, or membranes. Even the European mineral brick wall built houses contain vapor barriers on the roof system. This practice is supposed to solve the problem of moisture in envelope walls by controlling vapor flow and water entry.  </p>
<p>Water passes barriers in different forms but always because of forces in action.<br/>Driving forces can be gravitational, capillarity, wind washing, or pressure forces occurring because of the temperature differences between the conditioned space and the exterior environment (air/vapor pressure differential).<br/>Water gets inside of walls because of those forces in action, but when we want them to dry out, there are no forces to drive water and vapors out of the walls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, this problem is not solved by classical vapor barriers, air/vapor permeable insulations, air flow through walls, drainage or wall-ventilation systems. Water that sill damages buildings is impetuous called: intruding water, incidental water or remnant humidity. In fact, the vapor barrier become a condensation plane in various heat loads along with other materials which acquire a dew point temperature. This vapor barrier always prevents this water from drying.<br/>Drainage-planes also do not work to prevent moisture. Porous materials that absorb water will not drain out until the material is saturated, containing 100% of the humidity which that material can hold. You can imagine what that’s mean for the cladding and exterior insulation…</p>
<p>The results can be seen nearly everywhere, especially when repairs and renovations are required.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528725023/bsq20amh1t1psrauzzfc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is the reality, but the accepted advice is to follow published regulations and guidance on combining insulation, air barriers, and the permeability of materials for walls to control condensation…</p>

<p><strong><i>Instead, EIOS is custom-made and created on your house/building as an insulation system that is 100% waterproof, 100% airtight and 99.9% vapor-impermeable. This will keep any form of water out of the insulation.</i></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>EIOS is consistently vapor-tight when applied to the building, including intersections with windows/doors and other penetrations, so no fluid leakage can occur.  </p>
<p>EIOS complete separates the different environments, so as the structural element of the building is entirely in one environment. Because EIOS is usually installed on the exterior, the supporting structure has the same temperature as the interior vapors, prohibiting condensation. The dew point of the warm moisture-laden air is always inside of the EIOS system, remote from the inner surface, which never become a condensation plane.<br/>Along with the water impermeability and complete air-tightness, the imperviously-created EIOS Thetmosystem solves all moisture issues that can harm your house for an unlimited time, guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong>The energy efficiency of walls is not only based how much insulation you install, but also on how much the building uses the insulation installed in order to reduce the heat flow.</strong></p>
<p>Besides accumulating condensation/intrusion water and decay, walls are a big waste of energy. Thicker or doubled walls are promoted to support more cavity insulation and to provide places for installing in-wall vapor barriers.   </p>
<p>The wasted money and time used to build those walls and to provide energy to heat or cool the environment comes out of your pocket.</p>
<p>Energy assessment audits are made exclusively by using software. The program used no matter which will simply take the R-value specified for the insulation product used (the laboratory tests for λ, R) and applies it to the building according to the wall measurements. Reduction coefficients are applied only for thermal bridges, solar exposure, etc. and are not realistic for in-cavity convection, around windows, and through the walls phenomenon (looping convection, through insulation convection, infiltration end ex-filtration, reduction of R-value by increasing the humidity content, air flow, etc.). Those phenomenon are the major source of wasting energy, water accumulation, and mold growing in the envelope walls that surround you and the problems are hidden in the case of every cavity. These issues with all the consequences can be extended to every insulation system permeable to water/air/vapors combined with the classical water/air/vapor barrier.</p>
<p><strong>It is very important to understand that in-cavity convection and the related wasting of energy does not depend on the air tightness of the wall construction.</strong></p>
<p>The in-cavity looping convection is generated by the two fronts of air generated by the high thermal conductivity of sheathing, air/vapor barrier, and cladding on the exterior, as well as the gypsum sheathing enclosure on the interior which passes a lot of heat/heat-deficit inside of the walls.</p>
<p>The two fronts of air and the air pressure differential creates air movement, looping of the insulation and direct convection.</p>

<p><strong><i>Insulation becomes an object put inside the walls that does not use its insulation value.</i></strong></p>
<p>The R-value of insulation is just a laboratory number determined and is not very often applied to the building envelope.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We present this case because of two main reasons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. With very few exceptions, most people believe that if an insulation is 95% airtight, the insulation will be about 90% effective. In fact, for a 95% air tightness of insulation, the effectiveness of R-value is less than 30% from the specifications of the insulation material installed. </strong></p>
<p><i>The “leaky pot effect” (see video) makes it easy to understand the energy lost inside of walls because the insulation is not 100% airtight. </i></p>
<p><strong>2. EIOS was </strong><strong>“</strong><strong>compared</strong><strong>”</strong><strong> in thickness with other insulation systems. To achieve code requirements, designers, builders, and home owners know that the building envelope </strong><strong><del cite=""mailto:leah%20anson"" datetime=""2018-04-13T23:57""> </del>not supposed to fall below a specified R-value, which is transposed in practice in thickness of the insulation and many times in the thickness of the walls in order to achieve the minimal energy efficiency requirements. </strong></p>
<p><strong>With the R-value of 100% effective, a regular 3-inch (7.62 cm) EIOS proves in practice a thermal efficiency above a 1 foot (30 cm) cavity padding insulation. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The effectiveness of the thermal envelope R-value of the building is decreased by the air leakage of the walls and the low air tightness of the insulation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528731304/r1ptkei1inw7afavl7y2.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p><strong><i>The R-100% effectiveness of EIOS Thermosystem makes the difference between Non-Permissive and other permissive insulations.</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528731806/wzud6xrfxjv0f7xye3ae.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>R-effective (the insulation value applied to the building in real construction) is very different than the R-Specified (the insulation value of the insulation material).</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So in translation, those who ignore these factors and do not choose the correct solution for its thermal insulation system, buys in vain thinking that it can bring a long-term continuous saving. An envelope wall, thermal inefficiency, and exposure to moistening, mold, and degradation can now be replaced with a wall that is extremely efficient, permanently dry, without the hazard of growing mold and degradation. The EIOS wall maintains a pleasant and healthy ambience to the interior.</p>
<p>Code requirements all over the world specify insulation values according to climate zone.</p>
<p>For example, in the US, the code requirements for new construction, roof systems are:</p>
<p>R30 in Miami, FL Hot-Humid climate</p>
<p>R49 in Minneapolis, MN Cold climate (BTU unit system)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By comparative observation on real projects, we estimate that an EIOS building envelope will be at least two times more thermally efficient than other buildings that meet standard code requirements. This is estimated on EIOS R17.5, 3 inch (7.62 cm) of Non-Permissive Insulation. Obviously this is not based on the R-numbers. It is a result of poor-effectiveness of air-based, permissive insulations, and of course, by the 100% Effectiveness of EIOS.</p>
<p><i>Conclusion: Do not compare EIOS with codes and requirements, just because non-permissive insulations are not yet specified by codes. </i></p>
<p>In the case of the in-cavity installed, air-permeable, air-leaky insulations, the thermal efficiency of the wall is based mostly on the air-layer enclosed in the airtight-cavity (which is not taken into consideration by energy assessment software and pros), and <strong>not</strong> by using the insulation value and conductivity of the insulation.</p>
<p><strong>If the first goal of EIOS is the elimination of moisture issues, increasing the thermal efficiency of your building all at a lower construction price is just as powerful. </strong></p>

<p><strong>What makes homes unhealthy?</strong></p>
<p>Basically speaking, a house is healthy as long as it is dry, but it becomes sick when moisture rises above normal levels.  <br/>When non-permissive insulation was first applied, either experimentally or on actual projects, the primary concern was to verify moisture content in the materials of supporting structure both before and after the insulation system was put to function as an environmental separator for a specific period of time.</p>
<p>When differences of temperature apply, usually the humidity of a wall structure increases during vapor movement from warm to cold and condensation occurs in the cold area of the enclosure walls. <br/>The nice surprise was that in every case, the humidity of structural materials decreased after heat/cold loads, instead of increasing.<br/>When we made the first experiments on non-permissive insulation, the exciting results revealed the decreasing of wood content humidity when normally a vapor-permeable constructed wall should increase its water content due to condensation.</p>
<p>For the inventor of EIOS, this was the first confirmation that the concept is right and that the system functions better than expected.<br/>Simulation programs reveal water accumulation from condensation in the quantity of 4 kg/m² (about 1 lb/ft²) for almost every wall configuration in a continental climate (non-extreme climate) on every cold season of the year.<br/>Comparing this with zero condensation and an actual decrease of moisture content, we believe that this is the best option for your structure.</p>
<p>At first the inventor founds this phenomenon baffling and named the effect Unidirectional Drying.<br/>Later, the explanation for this phenomenon became clear that a low heat flow passes through the non-permissive insulation without allowing any vapor to pass through. This small amount of heat creates a difference in temperatures from the surface of sheathing right behind insulation and the exterior environment, and other cold materials.</p>
<p>This temperature difference makes existent vapors move and water to evaporate.<br/>After finding this explanation, the inventor called it the Drying Effect.</p>
<p>Two situations are identified, depending on the thermal flow relative to the structural element of a non-permissive insulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the structure is on the side with the thermal flow and</li>
<li>when the structure is on the opposite side from the heat flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The video presents the physical phenomenon that creates the Drying Effect in the situation when the Structural Element is on the cold side of the separated environments.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYI-xe09PLc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Some people that have benefited from the EIOS advantages call this phenomenon the ""EIOS Effect"".  </i></p>
<p>The Drying Effect is not yet a certitude as the Avoiding Condensation phenomenon, but it is still an observation of facts and empirically given explanations.<br/>We hope with your support to have more funds for research in this new field of building science. We also hope that more institutions, laboratories, and even authorities will join our effort to implement the Zero Moisture Concept.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Why EIOS needs help</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>There are two main reasons why EIOS needs crowd support.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One is that the construction industry and building science is too well set in their ways with the current moisture control practice. The Avoiding Condensation concept involves a drastic change in mentality, which is not easy after thousands of years of building according to the techniques of merely controlling water, air, and vapors in buildings. More than this, by following the building codes, everyone involved in construction is absolved of responsibility, even if they know that more or less, sooner or later buildings will end up having moisture problems.</p>
<p>So, why should we make a change, and who needs to?</p>
<p>So far, except for a few building owners that understand the problem/solution, we could not find any builder or architect to adopt this new concept and use this new product on its buildings.</p>
<p>The next problem is to have the XPS extruded polystyrene EIOS Sealboard invented to suit’s the needs of double-sealing with polyurethane foam, manufactured in this shape by the industry producer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528746159/h9opmy7yee6hkzccra8b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We need projects using an industrial-producing amount of XPS, so the producer will modify its production line and only charge the conventional marketable price.</p>
<p>So far all EIOS projects were made by hand cutting every edge of insulation board. This is very labor extensive, and EIOS cannot afford to install it in the U.S. at a competitive price.</p>
<p>Our marketing strategy is to provide all package materials with the best quality and technical characteristics, as well as to provide the technical support and installation of EIOS for every project.</p>
<p>Every product in construction has an installation contractor that is more or less trained by the producer. EIOS is a new type of construction in many ways, so projects cannot be given to inexperienced contractors because failing is not an option.</p>
<p>Every project contracted through this campaign will be directly planned and led by trained specialists, and the inventor of this new concept will be available for all EIOS applications.</p>
<p>We face the common problems of startup lack of capital and slow marketing.</p>
<p>While preparing the EIOS brand to launch, our full-featured product for early adopters is an entire construction fitted with the new insulation system.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that while we have projects totaling 20,000 ft² and above in the U.S. the challenge will be to make the perfect job on every single project.</p>
<p>So far there have been no errors or defects of any kind on any EIOS project, and this is because of the high standards of the team members on the site and the direct guidance of the inventor. By contracting EIOS during this campaign, contractors will benefit directly for their contribution and effort.</p>
<p>EIOS will take the projects from this launching campaign on its own, to get each team ready to install the product, for the best quality control on providing materials, solutions, detailing, site organization, and workmanship.</p>
<p>This is not a simple task, but we have prepared teams of people with many years of experience in this field to help switch to the new concept.   </p>
<p>Not many future EIOS projects will get this much attention and the Moisture Free Lifetime Warranty. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Join us in redefining thermal insulation!</h3>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","EIOS is the first insulation in the world that offers a cladding and finishing system that completely eliminates the condensation phenomenon in the building envelope (the exterior walls of every building that separate the interior conditioned space from the exterior environment) by applying in practice a new concept of creating Vapor-Impermeable Insulation Systems, called Non-Permissive Insulations.

EIOS is made out of high-quality Extruded Polystyrene XPS with joints invented for double-sealing with polyurethane foam and an over-sealing with polymer material. The XPS is a vapor-impermeable insulation material. By vapor sealing all joints and intersections with other objects (windows, doors, etc.), we create a vapor-impermeable insulation assembly, the Non-Permissive Insulation.
Condensation is avoided when vapors are prevented from passing through an insulation assembly that has been applied to an enclosure that separates two environments with different temperatures.
The basic theory of this new concept is expressed by the newly discovered Principle of Avoiding Condensation.

 
From ancient times when people started building shelters until the present, construction has been done in the same way – with the idea of controlling unwanted factors such water, air, vapors, and thermal flow. This EIOS campaign will change this field though.
Contemporary construction has been relatively successful in controlling water, air, and thermal flow in the building envelope. However, the vapor control, dew point and condensation in the envelope walls have left builders in a precarious position. 
The current type of design and construction of envelope walls attempts to control moisture by reducing condensation and by creating the possibility for the walls to dry out. Some of the techniques used include leaving intentional airflow through the walls, utilizing drainage plans, and providing ventilation of the insulation.
While the Moisture Control concept is based on cycles of wetting and drying from season to season and makes use of vapor barriers, the Moisture Free concept is based on the complete elimination of the condensation phenomenon by creating Non-Permissive Insulations.

Those revolutionary inventions, the Principle of Avoiding Condensation and the Non-Permissive Insulation need your support and acceptance to be a current practice. 
 
 
The majority of people think that the actual design and realization of envelope walls is based on Avoiding the Condensation Phenomenon, but in reality it is based on Moisture Control and Managing Condensation by applying water/air/vapor barriers, creating drainage planes, and ventilation of walls.The functioning of an envelope wall is based on cycles of wetting and drying, by accumulating humidity from condensation when the inside-outside temperature differences apply and by naturally drying the walls. The wetting of the envelope walls occurs when the inside of a structure is heated because of the outdoor colder temperatures.  It also happens when a building is cooled inside, and the outside environment is hot and humid. In cold or hot/humid climates, the heating and cooling of a building is virtually all four seasons, with only short periods of time when air/vapor driving forces are not applied to the wall. This cumulative, short period of time when condensation does not occur is just not enough time to dry the water accumulated, mainly due to the air/vapor barrier layers applied. The consequence is the occurrence of dampness, mold, and degradation such as wood rot and corrosion.
 
In regular continental climates, the quantity of condensation water accumulated in a cold season (90 days) is about 1 lbs/ft² (3-6 kg/m²) and dries in 80-160 days, meaning a cycle of water accumulation and drying.
In cold or hot climates, the quantity of water can easily double, the wetting period increases, the drying necessary time exceeds the period of the drying season, and moisture accumulates.
The consequence is well known: the beginning of interstitial (in the wall) mold grown, degradation of indoor air quality, fast decay of envelope walls, expensive repairs and lowering of property value.

 
While the entire world builds according to principles of Moisture Control, EIOS is our proposal to start building without moisture, based on the Principle of Avoiding Condensation.
 

Each of us lives in a house or building that must maintain a comfortable temperature and humidity level. Those conditions create differences of temperatures and relative humidity which in turn generates driving forces for energy flow and air/vapor movement. Temperature differences also generate dew point and condensation with the related consequences resulting in mold and degradation.While the energy flow can be slowed down by adding real insulation value, the condensation phenomenon had no solution before the invention of the Principle of Avoiding Condensation.

A New Principle of Technology which enables the design of envelope walls without condensation.
One of the goals of this campaign is to share this new technical principle with the world. This allows builders to construct building enclosures that have completely eliminated the condensation phenomenon, the cycles of wetting and drying, mold, and degradation within envelope walls.


People involved in construction can attest to the fact that, when it comes to vapor transfer, condensation, mold, and consequences our actual prescriptive requirements for moisture control depend on the “vapor diffusion paradigm” and not on scientists’ default and reproducible experiments.                                            
The actual fundamental principle to control water in vapor form is to keep it out and to let it out if it happens to gets into the wall. Another common principle is to encourage drying mechanisms over wetting prevention mechanisms. This gets complicated because sometimes the best strategies to keep water vapor out actually end up trapping water vapor in, plus varying climates and seasons make this even more complicated. If using these principles, there needs to be different strategies for different climates. There also has to be consideration for the differences between summer and winter if following this principle, but this is rather impossible.
All these stipulations lead to legitimate question:
Is there a situation, configuration, or assembly that could avoid the condensation completely despite the climate or season? Can we have a general rule to use as a principle to avoid condensation in building enclosures and other such enclosures?
The answer is YES, and it makes the object of the new theory of Non-Permissive Insulation. The Principle of Avoiding Condensation can be formulated, understood, and used in designing and constructing enclosures. The value of this principle is obvious.
As a basic fundamental of science, the Principle of Avoiding Condensation is defined as:
When there is a temperature difference and an enclosure is interposed between the high interior temperature and the low exterior temperature (or vice versa), in order to avoid condensation, the heat flow needs to convert the cold flow in an insulation material or in a thermo-insulation assembly without vapor diffusion or any air/vapor flow that carries warm vapor towards cold areas.

After a deep understanding of the phenomenology and configuration of Vapor Impermeable Insulation or Non-Permeable Insulation Assemblies, the Principle of Avoiding Condensation can have a simple definition:
The condensation is avoided when the heat flow converts the cold flow in a Vapor Impermeable Insulation or a Non-Permissive Insulation Assembly.

Be the first to read, understand, support, and implement this theory – it will change the thinking of how to construct walls and buildings.
So, the philosophy of this new Principle is that heat has to meet the cold in an insulation material or system without the presence of any vapors. By achieving this, the warm environment is ""stopped"" on the warm surface of the insulation, which is a condensation-free plane, because is in a dew-point free area.
  
By applying this theory in practice, the engineer Marius Radoane invented a Thermal Insulation and Finishing System which eliminates all problems of condensation, intruding or absorbed water, and in certain situations, the wall that receives this system dries to an unexpected humidity level, by simply applying a difference of temperature. This revolutionary design was first called “Non-Permissive Exterior Insulation and Finishing System (NP-EIFS)” and was invented as an integrated Concept, Technology, and Details to function in all real construction situations.
The actual promoters of wall systems teach us that a 30-40% humidity in the wood frame and drywall is normal. However these buildings have a short lifespan and lots of problems.
By applying the Principle of Avoiding Condensation materialized in the Design Technology to Eliminate Condensation we created EIOS (Exterior Insulation Over Specified). We bring to the world the first high insulated wall system that dries and stays dry in all environmental situations, providing an alternative to the breathing, wetting, and energy flow walls.
A new age of high-performance building envelope starts with the Principle of Avoiding Condensation, the theory of Non-Permissive Insulation, to which all can benefit.
More details on our campaign and proofs of how EIOS technology works please visit https://eios.co/
 

We are proud to introduce the first insulation and finish system that completely eliminates the condensation phenomenon on envelope walls. This is an integral solution to clad and insulate a building that guarantees permanently dry walls, no dampness, mold, fungi or degradation, as well as thermal efficiency Real R-value equal to the specified value of the insulation materials used.
EIOS high performance rendering is not possible without an integrated system between Concept, Technology, and Details that have been integrated to achieve the final goal.

The Zero Condensation Concept is the idea of eliminating the condensation phenomenon and intruding water. It also solves the problem of decreasing the specified thermal efficiency of insulation materials and/or partially applying the insulation value to envelope walls. All these things are only possible by applying the Principle of Avoiding Condensation and the theory of Non-Permissive Insulation.
Technology is created to achieve the Concept Goal. Regardless of how good a technology is, and what performance products uses, if the Concept does not stand up, the product results will fails.
A good cladding technology will also fail if the details of intersections with other constructive elements are deficient and not in accordance with the concept goal.
EIOS Technology provides insulation and triple sealing of every joint of insulation boards and intersection with other construction elements such as windows, doors, and other openings on the structure’s interior facing towards the exterior.

Detail Solutions are unique for each particular building.
These details form an integral part of EIOS technology to achieve the goal of avoiding condensation.
 

After six years of experimentation, applications, improvements, enlarging of scopes, observations, measurements of results, and patenting, we can give a close look at EIOS features:

 

All those benefits arise from the philosophy of avoiding condensation, and EIOS is the first one in the field to utilize this concept.
When contracting EIOS, you have all those benefits under one lifetime warranty.
 


EIOS System is the most advanced cladding, insulation and finishing system that you can have for your house or building investment, with a real distance from anything else you can find, relating functionality, durability and quality.

With the Zero Moisture feature for the thermal-envelope walls for an unlimited time, we give a Lifetime Warranty that your house will be dry and healthy. The Moisture Free warranty applies to any way in which the exterior environment can cause moisture by condensation, even including any form of intruding water.
EIOS System comes with an attractive stucco appearance and can accept any architectural design, color, and finishes.
 A special price is available only with this campaign. It includes all material, scaffolding for low-rise constructions, exterior finishing, completion of the job, and EIOS Warranty.      
We consider it imperative to apply the same concept used for walls to the roof or ceiling in order to complete the thermal envelope. Roofs and ceilings, especially for low-race buildings and houses, are the most exposed part of the building to vapor flow, air leakage, and hot and cold flow.
For this reason, we always connect the environmental separator EIOS for walls with the environmental separator EIOS for roofs or ceilings.

Solutions are unique for each particular building.
EIOS Thermosystem is created by assembling air/vapor impermeable extruded polystyrene XPS boards, invented to create two sealing joints. These joints allows sealing two times with closed-cell expandable polyurethane foam.

The whole assembly (including intersections with other constructive elements such windows, doors, penetrations, and terminations) will be over-sealed with a special formula of polymer-based sealant material to ensure that no vapor can diffuse through the Thermosystem.

 
A strong and durable reinforcing layer called Lamina is applied over the Vapor-Impermeable Insulation Assembly.  On the Lamina is applied the finishing coat with a desired texture and color to complete the EIOS System.
The envelope wall can be this simple.  Because of its Non-Permissive features, it will achieve the thermal efficiency of complicated, double-layered, expensive, moisture-controlled walls.

The starter-track is sealed to the structure and creates a strong and anti-termite band on the foundation of the construction. The anti-termite band eliminates the usually costly repair needed within a few years of construction because of termite infestation.  Most common types are against the code requirements of drainage and ventilation of the cladding or exterior insulation (drainage and ventilation means a bottom provided opening to the exterior for water to drain and for air intake).
EIOS Thermosystem is also very strong, and does not crack like other hard-coatings.
EIOS System is vital for wooden, moisture-sensitive construction with air/vapor permeability and susceptibility to dampness - timber construction, wooden structure + OSB/plywood or galvanized sheet profiles + sheetrock, and new and retrofit construction.
By contracting EIOS during this campaign, you have a 20-year Stability, Crack-Free Warranty.
While the 20-year Stability and Crack Free Warranty is invaluable, we believe that the Moisture-Free Lifetime Warranty - only available in this campaign - is the most incredible benefit you can have for your house or building investment.
 
EIOS System Projects We want to introduce you the first house built according to the Principle of Avoiding Condensation.  We periodically inspect and monitor it for moisture issues, indoor air quality, and comfort in relation to thermal efficiency.
The house is the dream home of a family with two children, hand crafted by wood with a wonderful spirit of natural living inside.

The project was completed in 2013 and is located in Romania, eastern Europe (equivalent to climate zone 5 in the US).
The specs of the construction includes:

timber exterior and interior walls, 12 cm (5 inch), no air-tightness of walls and window/doors intersections;
rafters, wainscot apparently on the inside and batten roof decking as roof structure, zero air-tight considered;
upstairs attic living space (mansard);
EIOS 8System and EIOS 8Sky, 8 cm (about 3 inch) Non-Permissive Insulation, R18 (US Effective R-value) as Environmental Separator;
EIOS 8 cm Thermosystem ground floor insulation;
two floors of 65 m² (700 ft²) totaling a 130 m² (1400 ft²) interior living space (without walls), enclosed by 450 m² (4850 ft²) thermal envelope (including floor);
triple-glazed, low-e high quality windows and doors, representing about 0.1% of the total thermal envelope.


 
After four years of observations of the occupied home, we conclude:

the wood structure has a constant moisture content around 11%, the entire house is constantly dry with no condensation or intruding water;
no mold grows or other organisms developed in the wood frame and the interior still holds a pleasant smell of pine tree;
the heating energy use over five months during winter (equivalent to NY climate zone) is about 30 - 40 kWh/m² (2.8 - 3.7 kWh/ft²) of thermal envelope per annum, including the hot water for four people;
the cooling energy for the hot season is zero, the house does not have any air conditioning system on the summer. Inside temperatures slightly rise above comfort for a short period of time during the day, but only for a few days out of the year.

The family living in this house is complete satisfied of its decision, very happy with the comfort and the very low costs of energy bills. They are aware that they could easily made the mistakes of regular construction. They would have ended up in an uninhabitable house in the summer without the help of cooling systems and would have increased their winter energy bills by four times. Plus they would have had to deal with the inevitable mold and fungi that lives in a traditionally-built house. 
The family is now life-long believers in the EIOS system.
 

Soon after inventing the Non-Permissive insulation for wall systems, the inventor realized that this system should apply also for roofs in connection with the walls to complete a building enclosure.

Roofs are always made out of moisture sensitive materials, are made less airtight, and are the most exposed to the vicissitudes of nature.  
This is why the EIOS concept branched out to EIOS Sky, the Non-Permissive insulation system for roofs in 2013.
The most common feature of roofs is that they have very little to no existing air tightness.

If you have the resourceful idea to have a living space in the attic instead of a cold/hot attic, you face the technical dilemma of making the roof more airtight and having moisture accumulation problems or to make in-wall ventilation that lets intentional airflow through the walls to manage moisture but ends up having very less thermal efficiency.
Real construction is somewhere in between, and home owners deals with exposure to toxic indoor molds and pay unreasonably high energy bills.
As a revolutionary solution, EIOS Sky solves all these problems with the Non-Permissive Thermosystem.
 

EIOS Sky is always Non-Permissive-connected with the exterior wall insulation such as the EIOS System. 
The less-airtight roof decking is the perfect substrate for applying EIOS Sky.

EIOS Sky is placed in the best location for protecting the building, which is certainly on the outside of the structure. 
The system creates an insulation shell that eliminates in-wall condensation, drastically reduces the energy demand, and protects from water infiltration, germs, and pollutants.  This results in a reduction to or even elimination of mechanical systems (in not-extreme climates).
 

The structural element (roof frame) uses less material to build, less chemicals to protect for moisture, foils and water/air/vapor barrier is not longer used, the design requirement to accommodating in-wall insulation is eliminated, and this is also an important saving for the investor, and for our natural resources.
The living space can be simply created, natural and pleasant, and always dry and comfortable.

A win for the builder, the owner, and the environment. 
If this concept suits your construction needs, do not hesitate to acquire one of our perks, and you are in for the best journey from solution to completion.
The Moisture-Free Lifetime Warranty also applies to this system.
EIOS Sky Projects
An old building in Bucharest, Romania was remodel and has been given a new look and utility.
The building owner chose to convert the old cold-attic in an office space. Being aware of the moisture and cooling/heating problems that this space will face, he searched for the best solution. He found EIOS.   
On October 2016, the old roof framing was replaced with a new one, and EIOS settled the solution to install the environmental separator - EIOS Sky.

 
Being a massive brick-masonry construction (with walls not sensitive to moisture) the facades ware insulated and finished with the classical face-sealed EIFS, connected with the Non-Permissive EIOS Thermosystem applied on the roof.
During construction and interior finishing, no-condensation water was noticed on the entire roof (regardless the high RH level). It is well known that a roof system containing vapor barrier produces some kg/m² of condensation water in the cold season. Comparing this with not-a-drop on the entire roof, the building owner feels privileged. 
The main visible feature of the new attic was the ease in which it was heated in the winter, and the less running of air-conditioning in the summer.
The owner is very happy with his decision and finds the price of EIOS Sky very affordable and lower than price to build with classical insulation system and moisture control solutions.
The most preferred roof systems in association with EIOS Sky are the Tiled Roof Systems, which ensures good exterior-to-exterior ventilation and a convenient attachment system.
 

On-the-roof insulation is not always suitable for real construction solutions and renovation purposes.
Converting an attic into a nice, comfortable living space or designing the last floor of a building to be a mansard or penthouse is very efficient for living but is also very challenging for moisture control solutions and thermal efficiency.

The main characteristic of attic rooms is that it cannot be inhabited in the summer without air-conditioning and the air clogs because of mold grown in the structure.   
Again, EIOS expands its application domain to be the complete solution for loft conversion and mansards as well.
An old attic with virtually zero air-tightness and exposed to high levels of cold and heat is the perfect place to install EIOS.

The environmental separator EIOS applied to the ceiling will immediately change the indoor environment once installed.

The special sealing ensures a vapor-impermeable insulation and guarantees that the unlimited Zero Condensation, Moisture-Free feature is applied to the entire surface.

EIOS now separates the two environments - your interior living space and the exterior. The roof framing is kept in one environment where in the summer the wood is dried by the heat and in the winter will be sterilized by the cold.
    
The reinforcement layer Lamina creates the perfect support that never cracks, for the plastering finishes.

EIOS Thermosystem again gives you a comfortable and healthy indoor, moisture-free and incredibly thermally efficient space – all lifetime guaranteed.

 
The roof of every house or building accentuates the nobility and charm of the construction, but the attic is not always suitable for living.

We strongly recommend that the living space be separated from the exterior environment by a Non-Permissive Insulation Assembly for moisture-free, high thermal-efficiency reasons. The thermal envelope of the building needs to be connected and completed with the ceiling of the living space.
The ceiling is the area most exposed to vapor-flow and to the thermal-flow from the interior, so a special protection is needed on this part also.
Today’s common practices always leaves the insulation fragmented and with zero airtight capabilities after installed, and the control layers are inexistent or difficult to be applied and very ineffective.

In alternative, we give two options for EIOS Thermosystem applied to ceilings to cover all construction situations:
EIOS for Ceilings with Lamina for direct finishing of the surfaces

or EIOS for Ceilings with an attachment system.

In many situations, the design requires a suspended ceiling to accommodate electrical and mechanical systems.
Also, it is well known that the poorly performing duct system in the cold/hot attic contributes to lost energy, condensation, and mold problems of the air-ducting system.  
We solve all those problems by applying a continuous EIOS Thermosystem as the environmental separator on the ceiling, provided with a strong attachment system for the suspended ceiling, and for other mechanical attachments.


All ducting can be installed in the interior conditioned environment with obvious advantages.
 
EIOS for Ceiling Projects
Of the many projects EIOS has, we want to introduce you to one that we did not expect to become a reality so soon.
This project is an eight years old house that has been lived in for five years by a young family with two children. It was extended in 2016 with a living room and a utility room on the ground floor and a master bedroom and a closet room in the upstairs living attic.
The house has two more bedrooms in the attic, so the homeowner knows very well how expensive it is to live in this kind of designed construction, both in winter and in summer. Searching for the best insulation solution for the new part of the house, the owner found EIOS.
In December 2016 an EIOS team installed the Thermosystem on the roof-ceiling and completed it with the Lamina for plastering finishing.

 
The extreme cold outside makes it very expensive to heat the inside, which is heated by a wooden pellets furnace.
After completing the EIOS on the ceiling, something unusual happened: in the extension of the house attic, the temperature inside rises above the rest of the house temperature.  This was only with the heat lost by the furnace downstairs and the insulated chimney flue that passes through the upstairs living space.
The homeowner made a decision: He wanted to remodel the entire house with this new concept. He wanted to have EIOS on the entire roof and ceiling.
In early February 2017, the drywall ceiling of the entire house was demolished and replaced with EIOS Thermosystem.

 
The insulation was already infested with the black mold.

The house uses at least two times less energy for heating in the winter and more than ten times less energy for cooling in the summer. This saving applies while the living space is almost doubled.
 

This campaign is all about how your house or building can be built more thermally efficient with walls containing zero moisture. It will require less money invested, less money in construction costs, and getting a Lifetime Warranty for those features.

When it comes to insulation, few may know that the actual solutions have two major issues:

The vapor diffusion paradigm and moisture accumulation and
The low insulation effectiveness of R-value and air-tightness weaknesses of the building.

The two principal issues fully resolved and associated with further EIOS advantages will give you the vision in setting goals that result in benefits.
Applying the Principle of Avoiding Condensation for a healthy home to design, construction, renovation and maintenance do not have to result in cost increases. By understanding the interactions between EIOS and building systems without trade-offs, cost savings combined with building improved performances, we can give a general view of how to save with EIOS Thermosystem.

Here are some special advantages of EIOS Thermosystem over EIFS (the closest insulation system to EIOS):

Any building and home can benefit today from the design technology to eliminate condensation and the use of insulation materials in ideal conditions, for an unlimited term, at the same price as deficient or illusory insulations.
 

The unsolved problem of moisture in the building envelope of every enclosure comes to an end.By contracting EIOS for your house or building investment, you will be one of the first to own a house with zero moisture in the walls due to harm from the exterior environment.Water can get in every regular construction by vapor movement and condensation, or via direct entry. EIOS is the first construction system in the world that claims to completely eliminate this issue.   
We all know that every single house/building without exception contains water/air/vapor barriers in the form of foils, fabric, or membranes. Even the European mineral brick wall built houses contain vapor barriers on the roof system. This practice is supposed to solve the problem of moisture in envelope walls by controlling vapor flow and water entry.  
Water passes barriers in different forms but always because of forces in action.Driving forces can be gravitational, capillarity, wind washing, or pressure forces occurring because of the temperature differences between the conditioned space and the exterior environment (air/vapor pressure differential).Water gets inside of walls because of those forces in action, but when we want them to dry out, there are no forces to drive water and vapors out of the walls.
 
Of course, this problem is not solved by classical vapor barriers, air/vapor permeable insulations, air flow through walls, drainage or wall-ventilation systems. Water that sill damages buildings is impetuous called: intruding water, incidental water or remnant humidity. In fact, the vapor barrier become a condensation plane in various heat loads along with other materials which acquire a dew point temperature. This vapor barrier always prevents this water from drying.Drainage-planes also do not work to prevent moisture. Porous materials that absorb water will not drain out until the material is saturated, containing 100% of the humidity which that material can hold. You can imagine what that’s mean for the cladding and exterior insulation…
The results can be seen nearly everywhere, especially when repairs and renovations are required.
This is the reality, but the accepted advice is to follow published regulations and guidance on combining insulation, air barriers, and the permeability of materials for walls to control condensation…
 


Instead, EIOS is custom-made and created on your house/building as an insulation system that is 100% waterproof, 100% airtight and 99.9% vapor-impermeable. This will keep any form of water out of the insulation.


EIOS is consistently vapor-tight when applied to the building, including intersections with windows/doors and other penetrations, so no fluid leakage can occur.  
EIOS complete separates the different environments, so as the structural element of the building is entirely in one environment. Because EIOS is usually installed on the exterior, the supporting structure has the same temperature as the interior vapors, prohibiting condensation. The dew point of the warm moisture-laden air is always inside of the EIOS system, remote from the inner surface, which never become a condensation plane.Along with the water impermeability and complete air-tightness, the imperviously-created EIOS Thetmosystem solves all moisture issues that can harm your house for an unlimited time, guaranteed.
 


 


The energy efficiency of walls is not only based how much insulation you install, but also on how much the building uses the insulation installed in order to reduce the heat flow.
Besides accumulating condensation/intrusion water and decay, walls are a big waste of energy. Thicker or doubled walls are promoted to support more cavity insulation and to provide places for installing in-wall vapor barriers.   
The wasted money and time used to build those walls and to provide energy to heat or cool the environment comes out of your pocket.
Energy assessment audits are made exclusively by using software. The program used no matter which will simply take the R-value specified for the insulation product used (the laboratory tests for λ, R) and applies it to the building according to the wall measurements. Reduction coefficients are applied only for thermal bridges, solar exposure, etc. and are not realistic for in-cavity convection, around windows, and through the walls phenomenon (looping convection, through insulation convection, infiltration end ex-filtration, reduction of R-value by increasing the humidity content, air flow, etc.). Those phenomenon are the major source of wasting energy, water accumulation, and mold growing in the envelope walls that surround you and the problems are hidden in the case of every cavity. These issues with all the consequences can be extended to every insulation system permeable to water/air/vapors combined with the classical water/air/vapor barrier.
It is very important to understand that in-cavity convection and the related wasting of energy does not depend on the air tightness of the wall construction.
The in-cavity looping convection is generated by the two fronts of air generated by the high thermal conductivity of sheathing, air/vapor barrier, and cladding on the exterior, as well as the gypsum sheathing enclosure on the interior which passes a lot of heat/heat-deficit inside of the walls.
The two fronts of air and the air pressure differential creates air movement, looping of the insulation and direct convection.
 

Insulation becomes an object put inside the walls that does not use its insulation value.
The R-value of insulation is just a laboratory number determined and is not very often applied to the building envelope.
 
We present this case because of two main reasons:
1. With very few exceptions, most people believe that if an insulation is 95% airtight, the insulation will be about 90% effective. In fact, for a 95% air tightness of insulation, the effectiveness of R-value is less than 30% from the specifications of the insulation material installed. 
The “leaky pot effect” (see video) makes it easy to understand the energy lost inside of walls because the insulation is not 100% airtight. 
2. EIOS was “compared” in thickness with other insulation systems. To achieve code requirements, designers, builders, and home owners know that the building envelope  not supposed to fall below a specified R-value, which is transposed in practice in thickness of the insulation and many times in the thickness of the walls in order to achieve the minimal energy efficiency requirements. 
With the R-value of 100% effective, a regular 3-inch (7.62 cm) EIOS proves in practice a thermal efficiency above a 1 foot (30 cm) cavity padding insulation. 
 
The effectiveness of the thermal envelope R-value of the building is decreased by the air leakage of the walls and the low air tightness of the insulation.
 

The R-100% effectiveness of EIOS Thermosystem makes the difference between Non-Permissive and other permissive insulations.
 

R-effective (the insulation value applied to the building in real construction) is very different than the R-Specified (the insulation value of the insulation material).
 
So in translation, those who ignore these factors and do not choose the correct solution for its thermal insulation system, buys in vain thinking that it can bring a long-term continuous saving. An envelope wall, thermal inefficiency, and exposure to moistening, mold, and degradation can now be replaced with a wall that is extremely efficient, permanently dry, without the hazard of growing mold and degradation. The EIOS wall maintains a pleasant and healthy ambience to the interior.
Code requirements all over the world specify insulation values according to climate zone.
For example, in the US, the code requirements for new construction, roof systems are:
R30 in Miami, FL Hot-Humid climate
R49 in Minneapolis, MN Cold climate (BTU unit system)
 
By comparative observation on real projects, we estimate that an EIOS building envelope will be at least two times more thermally efficient than other buildings that meet standard code requirements. This is estimated on EIOS R17.5, 3 inch (7.62 cm) of Non-Permissive Insulation. Obviously this is not based on the R-numbers. It is a result of poor-effectiveness of air-based, permissive insulations, and of course, by the 100% Effectiveness of EIOS.
Conclusion: Do not compare EIOS with codes and requirements, just because non-permissive insulations are not yet specified by codes. 
In the case of the in-cavity installed, air-permeable, air-leaky insulations, the thermal efficiency of the wall is based mostly on the air-layer enclosed in the airtight-cavity (which is not taken into consideration by energy assessment software and pros), and not by using the insulation value and conductivity of the insulation.
If the first goal of EIOS is the elimination of moisture issues, increasing the thermal efficiency of your building all at a lower construction price is just as powerful. 
 


 

Before launching the EIOS brand as an integrated concept technology and details to insulate and clad buildings, tests and experiments were made to prove the true attributes and how the product will perform in practice.
 



EOTA is the European Organization for Technical Assessment in the area of construction products, based in Brussels. 

 

What makes homes unhealthy?
Basically speaking, a house is healthy as long as it is dry, but it becomes sick when moisture rises above normal levels.  When non-permissive insulation was first applied, either experimentally or on actual projects, the primary concern was to verify moisture content in the materials of supporting structure both before and after the insulation system was put to function as an environmental separator for a specific period of time.
When differences of temperature apply, usually the humidity of a wall structure increases during vapor movement from warm to cold and condensation occurs in the cold area of the enclosure walls. The nice surprise was that in every case, the humidity of structural materials decreased after heat/cold loads, instead of increasing.When we made the first experiments on non-permissive insulation, the exciting results revealed the decreasing of wood content humidity when normally a vapor-permeable constructed wall should increase its water content due to condensation.
For the inventor of EIOS, this was the first confirmation that the concept is right and that the system functions better than expected.Simulation programs reveal water accumulation from condensation in the quantity of 4 kg/m² (about 1 lb/ft²) for almost every wall configuration in a continental climate (non-extreme climate) on every cold season of the year.Comparing this with zero condensation and an actual decrease of moisture content, we believe that this is the best option for your structure.
At first the inventor founds this phenomenon baffling and named the effect Unidirectional Drying.Later, the explanation for this phenomenon became clear that a low heat flow passes through the non-permissive insulation without allowing any vapor to pass through. This small amount of heat creates a difference in temperatures from the surface of sheathing right behind insulation and the exterior environment, and other cold materials.
This temperature difference makes existent vapors move and water to evaporate.After finding this explanation, the inventor called it the Drying Effect.
Two situations are identified, depending on the thermal flow relative to the structural element of a non-permissive insulation:

when the structure is on the side with the thermal flow and
when the structure is on the opposite side from the heat flow.

The video presents the physical phenomenon that creates the Drying Effect in the situation when the Structural Element is on the cold side of the separated environments.

 
Some people that have benefited from the EIOS advantages call this phenomenon the ""EIOS Effect"".  
The Drying Effect is not yet a certitude as the Avoiding Condensation phenomenon, but it is still an observation of facts and empirically given explanations.We hope with your support to have more funds for research in this new field of building science. We also hope that more institutions, laboratories, and even authorities will join our effort to implement the Zero Moisture Concept.
 


 
Why EIOS needs help
 
There are two main reasons why EIOS needs crowd support.
 
One is that the construction industry and building science is too well set in their ways with the current moisture control practice. The Avoiding Condensation concept involves a drastic change in mentality, which is not easy after thousands of years of building according to the techniques of merely controlling water, air, and vapors in buildings. More than this, by following the building codes, everyone involved in construction is absolved of responsibility, even if they know that more or less, sooner or later buildings will end up having moisture problems.
So, why should we make a change, and who needs to?
So far, except for a few building owners that understand the problem/solution, we could not find any builder or architect to adopt this new concept and use this new product on its buildings.
The next problem is to have the XPS extruded polystyrene EIOS Sealboard invented to suit’s the needs of double-sealing with polyurethane foam, manufactured in this shape by the industry producer.

We need projects using an industrial-producing amount of XPS, so the producer will modify its production line and only charge the conventional marketable price.
So far all EIOS projects were made by hand cutting every edge of insulation board. This is very labor extensive, and EIOS cannot afford to install it in the U.S. at a competitive price.
Our marketing strategy is to provide all package materials with the best quality and technical characteristics, as well as to provide the technical support and installation of EIOS for every project.
Every product in construction has an installation contractor that is more or less trained by the producer. EIOS is a new type of construction in many ways, so projects cannot be given to inexperienced contractors because failing is not an option.
Every project contracted through this campaign will be directly planned and led by trained specialists, and the inventor of this new concept will be available for all EIOS applications.
We face the common problems of startup lack of capital and slow marketing.
While preparing the EIOS brand to launch, our full-featured product for early adopters is an entire construction fitted with the new insulation system.  
 
Risks and Challenges
 
We believe that while we have projects totaling 20,000 ft² and above in the U.S. the challenge will be to make the perfect job on every single project.
So far there have been no errors or defects of any kind on any EIOS project, and this is because of the high standards of the team members on the site and the direct guidance of the inventor. By contracting EIOS during this campaign, contractors will benefit directly for their contribution and effort.
EIOS will take the projects from this launching campaign on its own, to get each team ready to install the product, for the best quality control on providing materials, solutions, detailing, site organization, and workmanship.
This is not a simple task, but we have prepared teams of people with many years of experience in this field to help switch to the new concept.   
Not many future EIOS projects will get this much attention and the Moisture Free Lifetime Warranty.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>We have developed what we honestly believe is <strong>the world's most functional apple grinder and presser for home-juicers</strong> who have apple trees growing in their garden. We are raising funds in Indiegogo to make it available to everybody. Samo is named after a Finnish <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apple_cultivars"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">apple cultivar.</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525089785/l1trvhbgd2e8cerpurmi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Why Samo?</h2>
<p><strong>Samo is a novel and innovative apple grinder and presser that’s going to change the way apples are juiced. Once you try it, you don’t want to go back to yesterday’s methods! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Grinding apples has been slow and laborious: </strong>whether your grinder is hand-cranked or runs with a motor, they often jam and generally don’t work very well. You may even have to chop apples into smaller pieces before your grinder accepts them.<strong> Moving the ground apple pulp into a presser is the next chore:</strong> you may have to wrap the pulp inside pieces of cloth or mesh to hold it together for pressing. <strong>Only then you get to actually press,</strong> <strong>which again takes a lot of time</strong> and finally, you have to extract the dry pulp and prepare the presser for the next batch, and eventually clean everything when you have finished.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524751781/t0vquciwa6wrhecl21nb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Too much work? Not with Samo! </strong>The idea of Samo was born out of frustration towards apple grinders and pressers currently on the market. <strong>With Samo, the juicing process is streamlined.</strong> First, pour apples in Samo’s upper keg and put the lid on. Next, run Samo’s super-fast grinder with your regular power drill. <strong>In a matter of seconds, the apples are ground </strong>and apple shreds have fallen down into the lower keg. Repeat to make the lower keg full of grind. Replace the upper keg and the grinder with the presser. Secure it in place and you are ready to start pressing. Use your power drill to screw the presser rod down and finish the pressing with a wrench if needed. <strong>As you press, the juice begins to run into the container of your choice.</strong> Cleaning? Just detach the lower keg and push the dry apple pulp out of it and you're ready to fill the presser again. <strong>When you have finished juicing, spray all modules clean with a garden hose and leave them to dry.</strong></p>
<p>With Samo, we want to make juicing apples a fun chore everybody can do with ease, and without having to buy large and heavy equipment for it.</p>

<li>Pressing disc</li>
<li>Juice bowl</li>
<li>2 × Kegs</li>
<li>3 × Locking bars</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Samo is a modular system</h3>
<p><strong>Samo consist of modules that stack upon each other. For grinding and pressing, you use different module combinations.</strong> Modules help to minimize the amount of parts and material needed, and make the workflow of making juice smoother and faster than with any other presser. Samo's 19 litre keg takes roughly 6-7 kg (13-15 lbs) of apples.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Grinder</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Grinding the apples is one of the biggest bottlenecks in the whole juicing process - it’s very time-consuming.</strong> In the initial stage of Samo’s development we paid very close attention to the existing methods of grinding apples. One of the biggest reasons for difficulties in grinding is insufficient force. Another key factor contributing to the performance of the grinders currently in the market is the design of the grinder.<strong> It’s not enough to grind apples just somehow. There’s a significant difference in how much juice you get out of an apple depending on how it is ground.</strong> You want to make shreds that yield the apple pulp’s juice out easily when pressed.  </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524730603/hnd5djoaxxwxhwf6mdef.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Samo’s grinder has been designed so that it sucks apples in and doesn’t get stuck</strong> which is a common problem. With Samo’s specially designed blades, it is also not needed to push apples in with a stick to feed them: <strong>it’s enough that you pour them in the keg, close the lid and start grinding! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The tooth profile of the blades bites into apple,</strong> grabs it and cuts through it.</li>
<li>
<strong>The twin-axle design</strong> <strong>forms a maw that sucks apples in</strong> and helps prevent clogging.</li>
<li>
<strong>The arrangement of the blades </strong>contributes to the sucking effect: during a revolution of an axle, there are always blade teeth grabbing apples and pulling them into the maw.</li>
<li>
<strong>The positions of the blades </strong>are synchronised so that there are never openings through which large apple pieces could fall through.</li>
<li>The material used for blades and gears is<strong> strong and stiff POM plastic,</strong> a durable and low-friction polymer, perfect for blades and gears. The POM we use is food-grade.</li>
<li>
<strong>The</strong> <strong>axles are geared at both ends</strong> which stabilizes them and improves the grinder’s life because there’s less torque and less stress per one pair. Also, should it happen you get a broken tooth on other pair, the grinder will still run with just one pair.</li>
<li>
<strong>The axles have ball bearings in both ends to provide long life,</strong> low friction and allowing high running speeds. The ball bearings' lubricant is food-grade.</li>
<li>
<strong>The drive axle has milled hexagonal end for easy and safe fastening of drill chuck. </strong>The axles are food-grade stainless steel, just like all Samo’s metal parts. </li>
<li>Thanks to open-structure design,<strong> the grinder is very easy to clean after use.</strong> Just spray it clean with a garden hose and leave it to dry.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Presser</strong></h3>
<p>The presser consists of<strong> the presser bottom</strong> and <strong>the presser top,</strong> <strong>a keg between them, the pressing disc</strong> that presses the apple pulp inside the keg, and <strong>three locking bars</strong> that keep the presser's modules together during pressing. The juice runs into the <strong>juice bowl </strong>and into the container of your choice.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525350265/a2ajdd7ojcee3bfeh2ln.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A major thing we wanted to improve in apple-pressing is how you have to move the apple pulp into a presser after grinding it.</strong> With existing methods, you either have to scoop the pulp from your grinder into a presser, or worse still, make ""cakes"": wrap small portions of pulp in pieces of cloth or mesh, stack them in the press and then press them. Both methods are time-consuming and messy, because the pulp is moist and sticky. <strong>With Samo, the pulp falls directly from the grinder into the presser and the entire stage is skipped! </strong></p>
<p><strong>The keg's diameter and length have optimal ratio for pressing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sufficient pressure is generated with minimum force to yield maximum amount of juice.</li>
<li>The juice flows evenly out of the keg to all sides, unobstructed.</li>
<li>The pressing distance is short which contributes to easy and fast operation.</li>
<li>
<strong>The pressing disc</strong> is disconnected from the presser rod,  floating freely on the pulp and contributing to the ease of use: It's effortless to put in place and pick up after use, and easy to clean.</li>
<li>
<strong>There is no need for extra plates</strong> that have to be added in the presser during pressing, as some pressers require you to do. T<strong>he presser rod is long enough to press all the way from start to finish, </strong>yet it is fast to screw fully in and out, thanks to the optimal ratio of the keg's diameter and length.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h2>The materials</h2>
<p>Samo's parts are made of four different materials: bamboo, stainless steel, and POM and ABS plastics.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Bamboo</strong></h3>
<p>Samo's wooden kegs are a nod to the traditions in juice and cider making, and wood gives Samo a nice and warm appearance. Bamboo  was chosen because it is one of the hardest woods around which makes it an ideal wood for Samo. It also has some natural anti-bacterial qualities. Bamboo is also a sustainable choice since it grows so rapidly. The bamboo we use is from China, and the parts are made in a certified factory that makes also other food-related products such as bamboo cutting boards.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Stainless steel</strong></h3>
<p>All Samo's metal parts are made of SAE 304 stainless steel, commonly used in food-handling products and household appliances.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>POM and ABS plastics</strong></h3>
<p>POM stands for polyoxymethylene, a strong and durable polymer. It is used for all Samo's plastic parts except for the lid and the juice bowl, which are made of ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). Both plastics are safe to use for food-related products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525089130/m96xsz92e0stibw5drjo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Samo's hexagonal shape!</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Why is Samo hexagonal and not round like other pressers in the market?</strong></h3>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. When we started to develop then unnamed Samo, we pondered between different shapes for the device. With fruit grinders the shape doesn’t really matter, but <strong>most pressers are round for a reason: a cylinder is one of the strongest shapes to withstand pressure.</strong></p>
<p>When a pressing force is applied to matter inside a cylinder, this matter tries to expand to other directions, that is, towards the cylinder walls. <strong>The walls must be strong enough to counter the pressing force</strong> so the force is applied only towards the direction of pressing.</p>
<p><strong>Round shape is the strongest, but also demanding to make:</strong> with the traditional apple presser construction, you need a lot of narrow wood strips for walls. Also, you need strong bands around the cylinder to hold the strips together and to reinforce the structure to withstand the pressure.</p>
<p>A lot of strips means a lot of pieces with a lot of holes, which requires a lot of screws to attach the pieces together. The more parts, the more expensive it gets, and everything has to be very precisely manufactured. <strong>Hexagon is a kind of a shortcut from a perfect circle. But it’s also a very practical shape!</strong> It's almost round and much stronger than eg. a square, and can be formed with six straight lines - or walls, which equals to much less pieces required than for a cylinder. The steel bands holding the hexagonal keg together can also be constructed from pieces, which contributes to cheaper manufacturing and makes it easy to flat pack the product.</p>

<p>Narrow openings in the keg's corners make a natural way to run the juice out during pressing without having to perforate the walls. It doesn’t hurt either that a hexagon is a very distinguishable shape and helps Samo to stand out from the crowd!</p>

<h2>Samo's story</h2>
<p><strong>Samo is an apple grinder and presser like no other! </strong>It’s a compact yet super efficient apple juicer for everybody who has apple trees growing in their garden and who wish to make their own juice.</p>
<p>The idea of Samo was born out of frustration towards apple grinders and pressers currently on the market. They just don’t function as well as they should, thought <strong>Antti, a craft cider and wine enthusiast, who was struggling to make apple juice for his cider. </strong></p>
<p>It took a whole day from him and his father to grind and press a cart of apples into juice at their family’s summer house. Despite they worked together, it was a laborious task they had to spend all day with. As a result, they barely got a bucket of apple juice for their own craft cider. What’s more to it, the apple presser and grinder they had was big and bulky, cumbersome to move around and took a lot of space in the car.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525245354/whiymlbtr4djqey1tei7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Team Samo: Ilmari, Sid and Antti.</i></p>
<p>Antti began to think there had to be a more efficient way to juice apples. <strong>He asked help from two of his friends, Ilmari and Sid, to join him in his quest to develop the world's best apple juicer. </strong>So the three began to search for better solutions concerning the whole process of juice-making: from grinding the apples to pressing the juice out of the grind, running the juice into a container, extracting the dry pulp from the presser and finally, to the cleaning the equipment after use. </p>
<p>It appeared they were not alone with their thoughts: social media was full of videos of people showing their own solutions for grinding and pressing apples. These DIY inventions were of varying quality: some were very efficient in one particular task, but were often very crude and nevertheless had a lot of room for improvement, and none really catered for all steps of the juicing process. What was most surprising to Antti, there were few commercial products available and they were not even better than some of the solutions devised by fellow apple-juicing enthusiasts. </p>
<p><strong>It seemed there was a pressing need for an apple juicer in the market for home juicers that would</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>be compact in size, yet have a good working capacity</li>
<li>grind apples fast, without having to chop them into smaller pieces beforehand </li>
<li>press juice out of the ground apples efficiently and easily</li>
<li>be easy to clean</li>
<li>be safe to use </li>
</ul>
<p>Antti, Ilmari and Sid were sure such a machine could be developed and made available to everybody struggling with the same challenges as Antti and his father. Antti as an engineer and Ilmari and Sid as industrial designers were sure this was an issue they could solve. </p>

<h2>Shipping</h2>
<p>Samo is a compact little wonder and doesn't take much space, but it's built to last and as such, not a featherweight: weighing 18 kg, it's expensive to ship internationally. We currently offer shipping to 8 European countries but if you live elsewhere, do not hesitate to ask us about shipping to your country: we will find out the shipping costs, get back to you and let's see what can be done!

</div></div>","About
We have developed what we honestly believe is the world's most functional apple grinder and presser for home-juicers who have apple trees growing in their garden. We are raising funds in Indiegogo to make it available to everybody. Samo is named after a Finnish apple cultivar.


 

Why Samo?
Samo is a novel and innovative apple grinder and presser that’s going to change the way apples are juiced. Once you try it, you don’t want to go back to yesterday’s methods! 
Grinding apples has been slow and laborious: whether your grinder is hand-cranked or runs with a motor, they often jam and generally don’t work very well. You may even have to chop apples into smaller pieces before your grinder accepts them. Moving the ground apple pulp into a presser is the next chore: you may have to wrap the pulp inside pieces of cloth or mesh to hold it together for pressing. Only then you get to actually press, which again takes a lot of time and finally, you have to extract the dry pulp and prepare the presser for the next batch, and eventually clean everything when you have finished.


Too much work? Not with Samo! The idea of Samo was born out of frustration towards apple grinders and pressers currently on the market. With Samo, the juicing process is streamlined. First, pour apples in Samo’s upper keg and put the lid on. Next, run Samo’s super-fast grinder with your regular power drill. In a matter of seconds, the apples are ground and apple shreds have fallen down into the lower keg. Repeat to make the lower keg full of grind. Replace the upper keg and the grinder with the presser. Secure it in place and you are ready to start pressing. Use your power drill to screw the presser rod down and finish the pressing with a wrench if needed. As you press, the juice begins to run into the container of your choice. Cleaning? Just detach the lower keg and push the dry apple pulp out of it and you're ready to fill the presser again. When you have finished juicing, spray all modules clean with a garden hose and leave them to dry.
With Samo, we want to make juicing apples a fun chore everybody can do with ease, and without having to buy large and heavy equipment for it.


 
Product features

One Samo consists of:

Lid
Feeder
Grinder
Presser top
Presser bottom
Presser rod
Pressing disc
Juice bowl
2 × Kegs
3 × Locking bars

 
Samo is a modular system
Samo consist of modules that stack upon each other. For grinding and pressing, you use different module combinations. Modules help to minimize the amount of parts and material needed, and make the workflow of making juice smoother and faster than with any other presser. Samo's 19 litre keg takes roughly 6-7 kg (13-15 lbs) of apples.


When working with Samo, you combine different modules when grinding or pressing. 




 
The Grinder
Grinding the apples is one of the biggest bottlenecks in the whole juicing process - it’s very time-consuming. In the initial stage of Samo’s development we paid very close attention to the existing methods of grinding apples. One of the biggest reasons for difficulties in grinding is insufficient force. Another key factor contributing to the performance of the grinders currently in the market is the design of the grinder. It’s not enough to grind apples just somehow. There’s a significant difference in how much juice you get out of an apple depending on how it is ground. You want to make shreds that yield the apple pulp’s juice out easily when pressed.  

Samo’s grinder has been designed so that it sucks apples in and doesn’t get stuck which is a common problem. With Samo’s specially designed blades, it is also not needed to push apples in with a stick to feed them: it’s enough that you pour them in the keg, close the lid and start grinding! 
 


The tooth profile of the blades bites into apple, grabs it and cuts through it.

The twin-axle design forms a maw that sucks apples in and helps prevent clogging.

The arrangement of the blades contributes to the sucking effect: during a revolution of an axle, there are always blade teeth grabbing apples and pulling them into the maw.

The positions of the blades are synchronised so that there are never openings through which large apple pieces could fall through.
The material used for blades and gears is strong and stiff POM plastic, a durable and low-friction polymer, perfect for blades and gears. The POM we use is food-grade.

The axles are geared at both ends which stabilizes them and improves the grinder’s life because there’s less torque and less stress per one pair. Also, should it happen you get a broken tooth on other pair, the grinder will still run with just one pair.

The axles have ball bearings in both ends to provide long life, low friction and allowing high running speeds. The ball bearings' lubricant is food-grade.

The drive axle has milled hexagonal end for easy and safe fastening of drill chuck. The axles are food-grade stainless steel, just like all Samo’s metal parts. 
Thanks to open-structure design, the grinder is very easy to clean after use. Just spray it clean with a garden hose and leave it to dry.

 
The Presser
The presser consists of the presser bottom and the presser top, a keg between them, the pressing disc that presses the apple pulp inside the keg, and three locking bars that keep the presser's modules together during pressing. The juice runs into the juice bowl and into the container of your choice.

A major thing we wanted to improve in apple-pressing is how you have to move the apple pulp into a presser after grinding it. With existing methods, you either have to scoop the pulp from your grinder into a presser, or worse still, make ""cakes"": wrap small portions of pulp in pieces of cloth or mesh, stack them in the press and then press them. Both methods are time-consuming and messy, because the pulp is moist and sticky. With Samo, the pulp falls directly from the grinder into the presser and the entire stage is skipped! 
The keg's diameter and length have optimal ratio for pressing:

Sufficient pressure is generated with minimum force to yield maximum amount of juice.
The juice flows evenly out of the keg to all sides, unobstructed.
The pressing distance is short which contributes to easy and fast operation.

The pressing disc is disconnected from the presser rod,  floating freely on the pulp and contributing to the ease of use: It's effortless to put in place and pick up after use, and easy to clean.

There is no need for extra plates that have to be added in the presser during pressing, as some pressers require you to do. The presser rod is long enough to press all the way from start to finish, yet it is fast to screw fully in and out, thanks to the optimal ratio of the keg's diameter and length.

 
The High Speed Kit
With an extra keg, presser bottom and juice bowl, you can double your working speed:

Stack Samo's modules in the grinding mode. Grind enough apples to fill the lower keg with pulp.
Lift off the grinder along with the upper keg and put it atop another presser bottom and keg.
Start grinding again! Now, while you are filling the second keg with pulp, your friend can press the pulp in the first keg.
Switch places! While one of you grinds, the other one presses! This way, you will make your apples into juice in no time.


 
The materials
Samo's parts are made of four different materials: bamboo, stainless steel, and POM and ABS plastics.
 
Bamboo
Samo's wooden kegs are a nod to the traditions in juice and cider making, and wood gives Samo a nice and warm appearance. Bamboo  was chosen because it is one of the hardest woods around which makes it an ideal wood for Samo. It also has some natural anti-bacterial qualities. Bamboo is also a sustainable choice since it grows so rapidly. The bamboo we use is from China, and the parts are made in a certified factory that makes also other food-related products such as bamboo cutting boards.
 
Stainless steel
All Samo's metal parts are made of SAE 304 stainless steel, commonly used in food-handling products and household appliances.
 
POM and ABS plastics
POM stands for polyoxymethylene, a strong and durable polymer. It is used for all Samo's plastic parts except for the lid and the juice bowl, which are made of ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene). Both plastics are safe to use for food-related products.

 
Samo's hexagonal shape!
Why is Samo hexagonal and not round like other pressers in the market?
There are a couple of reasons for this. When we started to develop then unnamed Samo, we pondered between different shapes for the device. With fruit grinders the shape doesn’t really matter, but most pressers are round for a reason: a cylinder is one of the strongest shapes to withstand pressure.
When a pressing force is applied to matter inside a cylinder, this matter tries to expand to other directions, that is, towards the cylinder walls. The walls must be strong enough to counter the pressing force so the force is applied only towards the direction of pressing.
Round shape is the strongest, but also demanding to make: with the traditional apple presser construction, you need a lot of narrow wood strips for walls. Also, you need strong bands around the cylinder to hold the strips together and to reinforce the structure to withstand the pressure.
A lot of strips means a lot of pieces with a lot of holes, which requires a lot of screws to attach the pieces together. The more parts, the more expensive it gets, and everything has to be very precisely manufactured. Hexagon is a kind of a shortcut from a perfect circle. But it’s also a very practical shape! It's almost round and much stronger than eg. a square, and can be formed with six straight lines - or walls, which equals to much less pieces required than for a cylinder. The steel bands holding the hexagonal keg together can also be constructed from pieces, which contributes to cheaper manufacturing and makes it easy to flat pack the product.

Narrow openings in the keg's corners make a natural way to run the juice out during pressing without having to perforate the walls. It doesn’t hurt either that a hexagon is a very distinguishable shape and helps Samo to stand out from the crowd!

Yuch!It's surprising how few products are out there that tackle curtain cling. Yes, there are weights and magnets, and I've tried curved shower poles in the past, but they're clunky, and while they do offer some extra space, for me, it's just not enough. So, I set out to design a shower curtain that would give me all the washing space I needed, without ever having to worry that the curtain might drift in to bother me. I also wanted a simple, elegant, flexible solution, that fits a standard straight shower pole. Not too much to ask surely?Occasionally in design, you start off in the wrong section of the project, and that's what happened to me. My early ideas concentrated on the space I wanted within the shower curtain itself. I had a great time creating fabulous designs of all shapes and sizes, building many prototypes and experimenting with how to support each design within the shower curtain.

 
Then I hit a design wall. This short video explains the issue:-  That moment of revelation was a real buzz, and I'll never forget it. I later sat down with my husband Chris and explained my idea on how to offset gravity and create the lift that would bring my idea to life. He was impressed and as always, very enthusiastic.
My husband is a product designer who at that time was developing a modular building design for a disabled bathing facility. Chris's broad experience in advanced composites helped in the next process of the development of the product, and we began prototyping and testing in the search to include our four design principles for the curtain:-

Simplicity
Versatility
Practicality
Creative Space

On completion of our working design, it was a great thrill to clip the new Symmetry Rings to the shower pole and throw that curtain wide. Turning that shower on and watching the water cascade into the glorious space I had created was a fantastic sensation.My husband scratched his head, and I heard him say, ""Crikey, Mirela, I think you've done it!""

Showering for me now has become my favourite time of the day. I may be biased, but having all that space is my dream come true.

</div><p> </p><p> </p><h2>FAQ's</h2><p> </p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>Everything that's a particle, whether it's a bacteria, mold, smoke, virus-infested particle, is going to be affected by the negative charge (emitter). Therefore, it can be collected from your space and drawn to a positive charge (collector) where it is destroyed.</p><p> </p><h3>Does Iona capture the Coronavirus?</h3><p><strong>Yes</strong>, Iona does capture viruses such as the coronavirus. It is a great supplementary device to use along with CDC recommendations such as social distancing, mask wearing, and washing hands.</p><p> </p><h3>Can I use more than one set?</h3><p><b>Yes, </b>you can add it dynamically and add more collectors and emitters to your space to add coverage. </p><p> </p><h3>When will I receive my Iona?</h3><p>The Iona is in development now with the first run of devices anticipated to be completed by <strong>March 2021</strong>. You can follow the production process on our <a href=""https://getiona.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blog</a> where status updates will also be posted.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Does Iona have any filters?</h3><p><strong>No.</strong> This is one of the main benefits with Iona over other Air Purification systems. With Iona every 3-4 months you simply pull out its collector surface and wipe it clean, then reinsert it. There are no extra parts to keep it going.</p><p> </p><h3>How much does it cost to operate?</h3><p><strong>Only Pennies a day.</strong> The Iona is designed to plug into any standard home outlet costing only pennies a day in electricity costs to operate. You simply plug it in and turn it on.</p><p> </p><h3>Does Iona create Ozone?</h3><p><strong>No.</strong> The system does not produce or generate any ozone. </p><p> </p><h3>Does Iona have a warranty?</h3><p><strong>Yes. </strong>Iona Solutions warrants the Iona-branded product contained in the original packaging against defects in materials and workmanship when used normally for a period of two years.</p><h3> </h3><h3>What is your return policy?</h3><p>If you are not satisfied with the Iona you can return it within <strong>30 days</strong> of delivery using our self addressed stamped return sticker. Just close the box up and apply sticker and send it back.

    With Iona you plug it in and you're good to go. There are no filters to replace and it costs only pennies a day to operate.   In the eye of a needle Iona captures the smallest particles; .001 -.3 microns, the most dangerous and the ones others cannot get.  The Challenge of Ultra Fine Particles  Ultra Fine Particles particles are so small that they go right through our lungs and right into our bloodstream. Those tend to cause the most irritation and ultimately disease. Iona captures ultra fine particles in your indoor space and destroys them.  Sphere of Influence  Unlike other air purification devices that push air through a single unit, Iona creates a Sphere of Influence between two units, a negative (emitter) and positive (collector).This is more expensive to produce, but it creates more coverage and is of much higher quality. We have chosen quality instead of cost cutting.   Iona Captures Viruses Iona’s two-part air purification system captures particles as small as viruses. When viruses are drawn to ions released by the emitter they are taken to the collector where they are obliterated upon impact. It’s similar to insects being zapped on an electronic insect killer device but with viruses its smaller than the eye can see and silent. They are rendered dead when they come into contact with the collector. Iona Kills Mold & Bacteria Iona kills airborne mold and bacteria. An average person breathes on average 12,000 breaths or 200 cubic feet of air on a daily basis. This includes floating mold and bacteria with each breath. With Iona mold and bacteria are drawn to the collector as they take on a negative charge and are killed when they come into contact. Iona Clears Smoke & Odors The Iona clears spaces of smoke particles and odors. As Ions flow between the emitter and collector they attach to pollutants such as smoke and over a short period of time remove it from the air. In an enclosed space smoke will eventually disappear as the Iona is left running.  Get a more restful sleep 

 
We are interrupted often from challenges with breathing clearly. You want to have the cleanest possible purest air you can have while you're sleeping. Purify your air with Iona and get better more restful sleep.  
Breath is life. We can only live a few minutes without it.

 
Help us bring clean air everywhere!
 
  FAQ's How does it work?Everything that's a particle, whether it's a bacteria, mold, smoke, virus-infested particle, is going to be affected by the negative charge (emitter). Therefore, it can be collected from your space and drawn to a positive charge (collector) where it is destroyed. Does Iona capture the Coronavirus?Yes, Iona does capture viruses such as the coronavirus. It is a great supplementary device to use along with CDC recommendations such as social distancing, mask wearing, and washing hands. Can I use more than one set?Yes, you can add it dynamically and add more collectors and emitters to your space to add coverage.  When will I receive my Iona?The Iona is in development now with the first run of devices anticipated to be completed by March 2021. You can follow the production process on our Blog where status updates will also be posted. Does Iona have any filters?No. This is one of the main benefits with Iona over other Air Purification systems. With Iona every 3-4 months you simply pull out its collector surface and wipe it clean, then reinsert it. There are no extra parts to keep it going. How much does it cost to operate?Only Pennies a day. The Iona is designed to plug into any standard home outlet costing only pennies a day in electricity costs to operate. You simply plug it in and turn it on. Does Iona create Ozone?No. The system does not produce or generate any ozone.  Does Iona have a warranty?Yes. Iona Solutions warrants the Iona-branded product contained in the original packaging against defects in materials and workmanship when used normally for a period of two years. What is your return policy?If you are not satisfied with the Iona you can return it within 30 days of delivery using our self addressed stamped return sticker. Just close the box up and apply sticker and send it back. You will receive a full refund.  Quality & Safety   Iona will meet all UL requirements for electronic safety.It will be tested by industry standard CADR, which is a Clean Air Delivery Rate Test that is done by the American Home Appliance Manufacturers Association.   Our Story  Ted Flittner has had a lifelong quest to understand breath, breathing, and how to breathe easier. And in so doing he has come across some of the technology that enables everyone to breathe easily, healthily, and effortlessly.View Ted Flittner's HistoryThe Story of Iona - Video  Bill Kunde has over 30 years of clean room design and management experience. He has travelled the world installing clean rooms. He has worked on the design and build of clean rooms for Apple and IBM. His dream has always been to bring an Ionization consumer product to life based on best practices from his lifelong experiences in clear room design and engineering.View Bill Kunde's History",13.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I came to this work five years ago and I worked in a company that specialized in pools, containers and many other similiar products made from plastic. In this company I inovated reducing material in production and I made these products myself. I didn't get the space needed for selfrealization so I decided to try it alone.</p>
<p>I tried making this cellar for two years. There were very high costs for the prototype so it was difficult. After two years I finally made it and started testing it. We had tested the prototypes many times in many different conditions. The first ones had a few mistakes but with every new model we got rid of more and more of these mistakes. Today is the cellar in a perfect condition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help </h3>
<p>You can help me mainly with machine purchases which will help make to make the building of the cellar easier and the price as well. I need the money primarely for purchasing these machines for speeding the building process. If the goal is not reached I will use every euro for purchasing these machines</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is this project good for people</h3>
<p>This cellar is made from polyprophylene which is used in food industry and it's fully recyclable as well. It's very durable and it can withstand high pressure without cementing it. It can also be put in fast, with good conditions in around 1 and a half hour. Rodents don't like this material and it doesn't taste them and there is no risk of mold either.</p>
<p>With this said, it's perfect for people that didn't thought of putting in cellar when build the house. This cellar is perfect solution becouse it can be put in fast.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My accomplishments are minimizing the building costs and i minimized the waste from 8-10% to 3-5%. I also inovated way of reinforcing of the cellar so they're very durable.</p>
<p>To not involve in any risk we tested these cellars in many different conditions, but we can't quarantee that there won't be any issues. If any issues occur we will be solving them as soon as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways to help</h3>
<p>If you would like to help in any other way you can share the link to this project on your social media.</p>

The
rational use of natural resources, first of all amongst all the energetic ones,
is one of those challenges on which  the
future of humanity and the planet is based. After decades of wasteful
consumerism ,there is need for a 
profound technological  and
cultural change. A real revolution where we are all asked  to help. 

Energy equivalent to 6 bilions euro! That is what the planet consumes just on Christmas lights in December. This means that in fact, we invest 6 bilions euro every year during the Christmas period, in pollution. Do we want to do something concrete to change this next year, 2016?     
L’
impiego razionale delle risorse naturali, prime fra tutte quelle energetiche, è
una delle sfide sulle quali si gioca il futuro dell’umanità e del pianeta. Dopo
decenni di consumismo sprecone e scellerato, urge un profondo cambiamento
tecnologico e culturale. Una vera e propria rivoluzione alla quale tutti siamo
chiamati a contribuire.   
Energia pari a 6 miliardi di euro! Tanto consuma il Pianeta con le luci di Natale nel
mese di dicembre. Questo tradotto vuol dire che investiamo 6 miliardi ogni anno,
a dicembre, in inquinamento. Vogliamo
fare qualcosa di concreto per cambiare da quest'anno, 2016?                                                                                                                        


















                                             


One of the highlights of this form of technology is the use of photovoltaic cells which are applied to recycle the light emitted from other sources, which are in themselves already lit up. Thanks to these photovoltaic cells, which are placed close to the lit bulbs, more energy is generated. Hence no electricity consumption.




Uno dei punti forti di questo sistema è l’utilizzo di celle fotovoltaiche per riciclare la luce emessa da fonti luminose comunque utilizzate. Per effetto fotovoltaico, le celle posizionate nei pressi delle lampadine accese generano energia che, senza aiuto di accumulatori alimenta direttamente i diffusori di luce led. Da qui il non consumo.





                                      









The XMAS LIGHTS is the first product we have designed and tested ... and it really works!

<p>Here at Tree Top, we think it is important to bring out our inner child every now and then to remind ourselves how we used to view this world.

<p>And we get that you aren't always in the mood of using a spinning top to turn on the lamp. We understand that there will be times when you wake up in the middle of the night with numb fingers. Therefore, Spin On is also installed with a touch sensor that allows it to switch on with a light tap of your finger.</p>

<p>In addition to the fun that Spin On will bring you, it is also very durably built. The interior is encased with 2 piece of solid pine wood and a beafy acrylic ring that will endure any temper during mail.

<p>Ever since I was a child, I<strong><i> loved</i></strong> working around the house with my dad.  Somehow it just wasn't work anymore, it was an experience.  There's something about a box with all the necessary tools to fix almost anything.</p>
<p>Now I would like to return to that sector and offer sturdy, durable tools to a new generation of DIYers and their families, as well as to those steady DIYers still in the game.  I want to give that same satisfactory feeling of having a box full of tools to get a job done.</p>
<p>What I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rental place to store the tool kits ( about $1,000 a month)</li>
<li>Funding for advertisements and a team ($15,000)</li>
<li>Funding for assembling, shipping, and selling of the tool kits ($17,000).</li>
<li>Funding to pay Indiegogo &amp; miscellaneous fees ($7,000)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<strong>I know I cannot do it alone</strong>. </h3>
<p>That is why I am reaching out to you.  I would be so thrilled if you would help me build this business up. In the process, we would be</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping America build! That alone is something very necessary.</li>
<li>Help a business to grow which would eventually lead to more job creation.</li>
<li>Make a girl very, very happy to be dealing with tools again!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>My Old Lemonhead Project</strong></h3>
<p>This is the biggest project I've ever undertaken.  I used to write and illustrate ""<i>The Lemonheads</i>"" children's books under the alias, Gila Ran.  (You can check those out on Amazon. ) That took a lot of dedication, a lot of hours, a lot of push.  I know this will require much more of a push and I'm ready and willing to do what it takes to get the business up and running.</p>
<h3><strong>Consider the Impact</strong></h3>
<p>There are many minority or Black-owned or women-owned businesses that are waiting to be born.  We have been held back, but we want to contribute to America and to the world. Helping this business take off would be a step in this direction.</p>
<p>Again, I know I should not embark on this alone.  I hope to team up with accountants and advisors to ensure all I's are dotted and all T's are crossed. And if you want to contribute with advice, that is welcomed as well.</p>

Comfortable and convenient, it allows you to go to bed knowing that you’ll be alerted if your child’s fever spikes throughout the night. We’re creating a fuss-free way to monitor your child so that both you and your child gets the rest you need for a better tomorrow.In early 2017, Boon Sain’s daughter had a serious fever, rising beyond a safe threshold of 40 degrees Celsius. It even refused to go down with medication! Panicked, all he could do was worry about his precious daughter. He and his wife didn't get a wink of sleep that night!Scarred by the frightful experience, he set out to make sure no parent had to go through what had happened to him again. Over the years, we’ve surveyed parents around the world and discovered that many had gone through the same thing and that strengthened our resolve to tackle this problem. Thus, Carell was born as a way to give parents some peace of mind while they sleep for the night.With Carell, simply let your child wear the device and go to bed! Using a proprietary algorithm that monitors your child’s temperature trends, it will alert you with a loud alarm, allowing you to take action quickly in times of trouble. Convenient and safe for you and your child. Monitor your child’s temperature trends throughout the night to alert you of any unusual spikes. It’s easier and more comfortable for both parent and child. Never disrupt your child’s sleep again. Doctors sometimes prescribe a cocktail of medications that can be hard to track. Easily monitor what medications your child has taken with convenient reminders. Your doctor will thank you for this comprehensive medication log! Developing children need their sleep. Monitor their sleep duration and ensure that they’re getting the proper rest they need. Carell can also detect unusual sudden movements throughout the night, giving you a precise time of event to consult your doctor with. When we're not looking, children tend to slip away. Acting quickly is critical to ensure they don't run off into danger. The proximity alarm notifies you when your child leaves a 1-3m radius of you, allowing you to act quickly should the worst happen. Young children go through a teething phase, making hard objects around them dangerous. Carell is encased in FDA-approved TPU, which is non-toxic and BPA-free. This means teething babies won’t be harmed if they chew on the strap.Teething children can't hurt themselves with the soft, food-safe strap! The soft, BPA-free strap encases the hard shell, preventing scratch injuries too! Young children are more vulnerable to radiation. Carell comes equipped with an offline mode that disables the radio transmitter on the device. Simply set the calibration profile over a week of use before using the device in offline mode. Parenting is difficult. That’s why we’ve made Carell as easy to use as possible! Simply use the app to setup the device over Bluetooth and strap it to your child. You’ll be able to have peace of mind knowing that the device is looking after your child. Carell is designed to last, being suitable for a wide age range of children, from toddlers to school-goers. In this age of fast consumption, Carell stands out as being a device that you only need to buy once for multiple functions as your child grows up. Carell comes with a free Android and iOS application for use with the device. Download the app onto your smartphone. Charge the device using any certified USB charger. Press the button on the device and connect to it. Strap the watch onto your child’s wrist, or baby’s upper arm. Strapping it onto the wrist like a watch also works for older children, as long as it sits snugly to maintain contact. Relax for a peaceful night’s sleep! ...unless something goes wrong, in which case you’ll be alerted to react quickly. We have been prototyping and testing Carell for the past year with our talented team of engineers.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ancient cats lived in the deserts and they acquired the necessary fluid from their preys. These preys contained about 70% of water which is the major water source for cats. Because of that, people often make the false assumption that cats don't need water or they are afraid of it. However, the truth is, they do need water but they just don't know it. </span></p>
<p>Jumping to present days, cats now eat a lot of dry food which has low water content (only 10%) and they need extra water to maintain a healthy body. As a result, for cats who do not like to drink water and only eat dry food, they'll be more likely to suffer from inadequate water consumption and develop urinary issues, renal failure and even kidney deterioration. All these can lead to critical health condition of our beloved cat and it is not something we want to see.</p>

The Noa ID is a sleek and cute pet collar that is waterproof and dust-proof. Think of it as an ID card for your cat. Once it is synced with Pura, Pura will recognize the ID and transfer necessary information about the kitten’s fluid-intake and feeding habit to the Pura APP. Everything is neatly logged. No more fumbling through messy hand-writing or missed entries on your pet logs. </div><div>

<p></p>
<h4>Cat Behavior Recognition A.I.</h4>
<p>The built-in high accuracy scale within Pura can accurately gauge the water volume change in seconds. However, when with multiple cats, doing a precise record and tracking accurate water measures is not that simple. There are many factors to take into consideration. Such as, when cats are playing water bowl, when cats drink water at same bowl at same time, water evaporation rate, and other unpredictable events. These factors can easily cause the error rate to increase. In order to solve these issues, we invented an Artificial Intelligence(A.I.) to interpret cat’s drink behavior. With this advanced technology, Pura can precisely recognize what is cat’s real water consumption.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Dynamic Filter Algorithm</h4>
<p>The electric water fountain allows continuous water flow but the water movement and vibration can interrupt the water gauge accuracy. Hence, we developed Dynamic Filter Algorithm to overcome the problem of accurately gauge water volume even with a running motor and moving water. </p>

<p><b>Any consumable materials or filters?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are two parts in the water filtration system. First layer of the filtration system blocks out cat hair and food crumbs. The second layer is the activated carbon filter; it takes away the impurities. We recommend both layers to be replaced once every two months. </span></p>

Pura in the media








Let’s face it, curiosity doesn’t kill a cat, dehydration does.In fact, urinary system diseases are one of the leading causes of death. According to statistics, 46.8 % of cats have suffered from urinary system issues such as urinary calculus, cystitis, renal failure or urethral obstruction at least once in their lives. 











Help your cat to maintain a good health





Automatically monitors how much water your cat drinks
PURA can accurately detect and calculate the water-intake of each cat. We spent an enormous amount of time perfecting the stability of our hardware with unique algorithm. Now, even flowing water can be accurately measured.






Bright, Minimalistic and Ergonomic Design
Our design greatly decreases the neck stress for our furry friend and creates a joyful water-drinking experience without wetting their whiskers.


Easy to Refill: Hassle-Free & Patent-Pending Water-Changing System
Fifty thousand germs would be generated each day if the water feeder is not cleaned daily and would result in cats’ unwillingness to drink water and therefore affect their health. NoaCare’s hassle-free water-changing system makes it easy for water changing and refills. It is safe, easy and intuitive.


Multiple Puras for Multiple Water Sources
Cats are wired to be adventurous and it is in their nature to find multiple water sources. By placing multiple Pura at various locations of the household, it increases the chance for your beloved kittens to drink more water. In addition, Pura's auto sync feature allows all Puras to be connected and automatically sync the data to your phone. The more Pura fountains you have in the house, the better chance your kitten would drink more water and the better you understand his or her health.


Pura App:  Keep Tabs On Your Cat's Water-Intake 


Pura allows cat owners to monitor the water-intake of their beloved kittens and determine if he or she is having enough water even when you are not around. Based on the profile info you enter for your cat on the Pura APP and the analytics of his/her water-drinking activities, the Pura app will offer you relevant health suggestions and alerts for your kitten accordingly. With Pura, you can prevent underlying health issues and seek veterinary care for your cats even before it is needed. Now you can spend more quality time with your beloved kitten which brings so much joy to your life.

Ancient cats lived in the deserts and they acquired the necessary fluid from their preys. These preys contained about 70% of water which is the major water source for cats. Because of that, people often make the false assumption that cats don't need water or they are afraid of it. However, the truth is, they do need water but they just don't know it. 
Jumping to present days, cats now eat a lot of dry food which has low water content (only 10%) and they need extra water to maintain a healthy body. As a result, for cats who do not like to drink water and only eat dry food, they'll be more likely to suffer from inadequate water consumption and develop urinary issues, renal failure and even kidney deterioration. All these can lead to critical health condition of our beloved cat and it is not something we want to see.

















Pura is an advanced smart water feeder with artificial intelligence, sensing and robotics.In Traditional Intelligent system always usually consist in automobile robotics  system, today we realize intelligent technology on our smart fountain: Pura. We hope use this change can save more cats' life and prevent further tragedy.In order to provide the best solution for our loving cat owners, we optimized our AI algorithm and Bluetooth 4.0 BLE communication protocol and were able to reduce Pura's cost by 75% and allow it to be possible for mass production. We also embed a flash memory to log cats’ water-intake. Pura also has a built-in Real-Time Clock/Calendar (RTCC) with backup battery so that data can continuously be logged onto the flash memory for at least half an year even without power.






NOA Collar ID &  NOA 360 Cat Sensing TechnologyWith the NOA Collar ID and the Noa 360-Degree Cat Sensing Technology, even if you have multiple cats and multiple Pura fountains, Pura App can still keep track and monitor the water-intake status of each cat. The Noa ID is a sleek and cute pet collar that is waterproof and dust-proof. Think of it as an ID card for your cat. Once it is synced with Pura, Pura will recognize the ID and transfer necessary information about the kitten’s fluid-intake and feeding habit to the Pura APP. Everything is neatly logged. No more fumbling through messy hand-writing or missed entries on your pet logs. 


Cat Behavior Recognition A.I.
The built-in high accuracy scale within Pura can accurately gauge the water volume change in seconds. However, when with multiple cats, doing a precise record and tracking accurate water measures is not that simple. There are many factors to take into consideration. Such as, when cats are playing water bowl, when cats drink water at same bowl at same time, water evaporation rate, and other unpredictable events. These factors can easily cause the error rate to increase. In order to solve these issues, we invented an Artificial Intelligence(A.I.) to interpret cat’s drink behavior. With this advanced technology, Pura can precisely recognize what is cat’s real water consumption.

Dynamic Filter Algorithm
The electric water fountain allows continuous water flow but the water movement and vibration can interrupt the water gauge accuracy. Hence, we developed Dynamic Filter Algorithm to overcome the problem of accurately gauge water volume even with a running motor and moving water. 






Specification









We started Pura with a heavy heart.15 years ago, Neo, our beloved Design Director lost a family member due to acute renal failure, Moka, the cat he has had for 14 years. It was a difficult time for him and the family and we are sure he wasn’t the only one who has ever experienced that pain. According to statistics, one out of four (25%) cats suffers from kidney failure due to the lack of water intake.With insufficient knowledge about pet care, it is easy to miss out on the opportunity to prevent, discover illness and seek veterinary care before it is too late. Without a monitoring device and appropriate logging, it is hard to know what really has been going on with your pets and the trip to vet clinic will only make you even more frustrated.15 years have passed, we still felt like nothing has been done to remedy the situation and that is when we started the mission to make a change. As cat owners ourselves, we took it to heart to create something that is what we would want for our cats and Pura is exactly that.As of now, we are an efficient small team working our way to ensure we’ve done everything in our power to make things right when it comes to developing Pura for our cats. This is a life-long mission and we are hoping that you’ll be joining us on this exciting ride, giving us feedback, suggestions and support to make it even better. Let’s give ourselves and our beloved kittens the quality of life they deserve.For the past few months, we've been heads down designing, prototyping, coding, testing, breaking and building.








Custom Noa Collar IDThe announcement for offering customized Noa Collar ID (for different colors and engraving names and phone numbers) will be available after the campaign and when the Stretch Goal is reached.

Health


How many times do I have to change the water?Pura keeps your water safe and fresh. We still suggest you to change the water every day to have the best water quality.
How much water does a cat drink per day?A normal cat's daily water consumption ranges from 5 to 10 fluid ounces per day (or an average of 60 ml/kg/day). Cats eating canned food will receive much of their daily water needs from its food, since canned food is about 70 to 80 percent water. *The amount is for reference only.

Mosquitos in the tropics carry dangerous diseases like Zika and Dengue and we need to do everything we can to stop this. Works both inside and out.  Growsafe is designed to withstand the external elements, and works just as well inside.Growsafe works through entirely natural, principles meaning it doesn’t need any batteries or electricity.  It uses a patent pending self-watering system to keep your plant perfectly watered.  The water reservoir which feeds the plant is completely sealed off to insects, meaning no mosquitos can get inside and breed.We have been through dozens of iterations and prototypes of Growsafe, testing different watering mechanisms, shapes, sizes , and of course testing a huge variety of plants.  After nearly 2 years of design, development and testing we have arrived the perfect combination of size, functionality and cost.  Using Growsafe is super simple.  Plant your plant, add water, and your done!TimelineWhy we need your helpFor the past 2 years we have been developing the Growsafe, through multiple prototypes and designs.  The product is now ready to bring to the market, however we need to support in producing the moulds the make the parts for Growsafe.In return you will be one of the first to receive a discounted Growsafe, and bring us one step closer to a Dengue and Zika free world. The Team  Brighten up your home in style, and grow your own food Thank youWe would like to say thanks to all of our supporters, and all the people who have provided us with feedback and ideas for the product.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Most home security products are overpriced, unreliable and sometimes both. </strong>The average initial cost to add a security system to your house can range from $250 to $1000.

<p><strong>Crime is an ongoing issue</strong>. You never know the intentions of unknown persons at your door until you open your door. Why expose yourself to danger? Have the peace of mind that you can safely answer your door with your smartphone and protect your most prized possession. Your home. From thieves while you may be anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>The best security can be ambiguity. </strong>If you don't know the person at your door, don't give them an opportunity to case your home.

</div></div>","An evolution of the toilet brush that is long overdue, the Balance Brush brings together much-needed functionality with striking design.
A perfectly balanced redesign allows the Balance Brush to sit up and drip-dry over the toilet bowl after cleaning, disposing of wastewater down the toilet, preventing a build up of swampy waste when stowed in its holder.

A dry brush truly is a healthy brush. Drying out the excess waster from the brush before stowing, reduces the ability for harmful bacteria to otherwise thrive - not to mention an unsightly swamp of unmentionables…
So say goodbye to the swamp, wipe that grimace off your face, and welcome a hygienic and visual masterpiece into your bathroom.

<p><strong>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death, causes the death of more than 255 babies every year in the UK. The risk of SIDS is higher for babies under six months old. </p>
<p>At the top of the list of NHS recommendations to prevent SIDS is the advice, “always place your baby on their back to sleep.”</p>
<p>The Lullaby Trust is a leading UK charity, working to raise awareness of sudden infant death syndrome. The trust provides parents with expert advice on safer sleep.</p>
<p>Their advice mirrors that of the NHS. They say: <br/>“You should always place your baby on their back to sleep and not on their front or side.<br/>Sleeping your baby on their back (known as the supine position) every night is one of the most protective actions you can take to ensure your baby is sleeping as safely as possible.”</p>
<p>But there’s no way of knowing if your baby has rolled over into a vulnerable position during the night.  </p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the Night Guardian?</strong></p>
<p>The Night Guardian is a revolutionary product that helps your baby to sleep safe.</p>
<p> <br/>The Night Guardian uses smart e-textile technology to turn your baby’s sleepsuit into its own alarm system. This technology was developed by <a href=""http://www.pireta.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pireta</a>, a global leader in creating innovative and wearable smart technology.  Radical new technology developed by Pireta involves printing interconnected sensors directly onto fabric. Using this technology, Pireta can transform any cot sheet or item of baby sleepwear into a smart e-textile which can then be utilised as an alarm. It's important to note that this technology is already used in healthcare applications.</p>
<p>We will work directly with Pireta to develop our Night Guardian prototype.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why I’m raising money to create a Night Guardian prototype</strong></p>
<p><br/>I remember how anxious I was as a new parent. The transition from Moses basket to cot was difficult and I struggled to sleep with my new baby in another room, out of sight. My hope is that the Night Guardian will prevent SIDS cases and give parents peace of mind that they’re doing all they can to protect their child. </p>
<p><br/>The Night Guardian is a patented invention that has undergone a basic feasibility study with NHS innovations accelerator (NIA). NIA exists to support high-impact innovations that will benefit the health of the population and found The Night Guardian to be a 'simple yet effective way to alert the caregiver the infant has moved into a high risk sleeping position'.</p>
<p><br/>I am seeking funding to create a market-ready prototype of The Night Guardian. With a prototype I can: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate exact manufacturing costs and affordability for low income households.</li>
<li>Identify the right manufacturer to produce The Night Guardian transmitter technology and smart application</li>
<li>Refine the technical details of the production process</li>
<li>Conduct consumer research </li>

</ul>
<p>This invention could lower the risk of SIDS. I will keep the cost of the invention as low as possible to ensure it will be available to as many new parents as possible. </p>

<p>It's the most straightforward way to reuse household water, with the lowest risk.  If you look on the internet, you can quickly find many knowledgeable landscape gardeners who will help you set up a legal sub-surface irrigation system.</p>If you read no farther, read this: <b>This campaign is to bring failsafe shower water diverter valves to the market, and I want you to buy a Diverta shower water drain for your garden to help this come about.  </b><br/><br/><p>BACKGROUND<br/></p>
<p>The challenge with using shower water is simple: how do you get that water out of your house according to the building code?  If you say, ""Who cares about the building code?"", the code is there to protect you and your house.  If a shower water diverter drain passes the tests and requirements of codes and standards made for it, there is less risk to your house in ways that you mightn't have thought of before watching the video above explaining the Diverta drain.</p>
<p>OS&amp;B is a local company that has made drains for North America for 40 years.  The company knows shower drains, and knows the codes and standards that the drains have to meet.  It seemed sensible to work with a capable manufacturer to build a legal, safe, diverter valve for your new shower install to feed your sub-surface irrigation system, whether or not you have installed one.  </p>
<p>But the Diverta is not your standard drain, so in order to convince OS&amp;B to make this wonderful new shower water diverter drain for  the world, I have to convince them that there is a potential demand out there.  All kinds of market research has been done on the need for an accessible under-shower diverter valve that is easy to use and to code ... but taking that first giant step is a biggie, and I am asking for your support, please.</p>
<p>WHO AM I?<br/></p>
<p>I am Christopher Adam McLeod.  I design, patent, and build<span> better drains for our bathrooms, but my background is in environmental science.  While studying in Japan, I came to see how much change we can effect through simple decentralized technology.  Sometimes a key piece of simple &amp; affordable technology at home is all it takes.  For gardeners that technology is the Diverta Shower Drain.</span></p>
A SHOWER DRAIN FOR ALL OF US<br/>A shower drain for building inspectors?  Inspectors want to see a shower drain that is marked certified to meet the requirements of the only plumbing fixture fitting standard referred to by all three North American building codes.<br/><br/><p>A shower drain for gardeners?  Gardeners want to divert their shower water to their parched gardens.  In the USA there are good best practices established for safe sub-surface irrigation of gardens with shower water fed directly by gravity - we just need a codeworthy shower drain.</p>
<p>A shower drain for both.  Building inspectors want home safety &amp; public health. Gardeners want green &amp; cheap watering.  The Diverta delivers.</p>
<p>If you install a UPC-certified Diverta Shower Drain in your shower, and hook it up to your garden sub-surface irrigation system, you directly contribute to saving one third of your household water consumption during the growing season.  That's 365 days of the year in Arizona and California.  So pre-ordering a Diverta on Indiegogo is not only helping to produce green technology, it is a tool by which you can start saving money, protect the water environment,  and grow flowers!</p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We seek $15,000 in support toward getting the Diverta Shower Drain going.</p>
<p>In return for your $99 ( + $20 shipping) you get your own, first edition Diverta Shower Drain (a $149 value): first in world, patents pending, certified to code and ready to be installed, or used as a model to sell to your customers.    In the box will be the drain base, a sealing gasket, a flange, a diverter/hair catcher, and a turning knob, as well as full instructions.  As a special surprise, a high quality gorgeous shower drain flange and strainer will be part of the package.<br/></p>
<p>For a $25 donation to our campaign, we will ship you a stainless steel hair catcher designed to fit inside your bath drain so that you can plug the drain on top of it.<br/></p>
<p>For a $5 donation to our campaign, we will keep you on a mailing list toward developing a conversation on shower water diverter fittings.  Your e-mail will not be divulged to other parties.<br/></p>
<p>What will it cost us to produce this drain?  Why is $15,000 necessary as seed? <br/></p>
<p>Certification and Manufacturing are our two biggest barriers:</p>
<p><i>Certification:</i></p>
<p>I designed this drain to pass the tests required of it in the drain standard referred to by all building codes: ASME A112.18.2-2012/CSA B125.2-12, as well as the UPC which has extra requirements.  The cost of testing and certification by IAPMO to the standard and the UPC building code in California of this drain is about a third of this cost.  <br/></p>
<p><i>Manufacturing:</i></p>
<p>This drain has been designed to work in concert with three pieces from existing shower drains.  This still leaves the the cost of making molds for the key pieces, as well as paying for the first order of injection molded pieces.  Thanks to OS&amp;B, arranging the actual manufacture and distribution is just a matter of product development, and I can get the best production prices.  But this valve is expensive: the base requires large molds, and the top two pieces, borrowed from a high-end shower drain not yet released on the market, are expensive thick-chromed brass.  The diverter insert also must be molded.<br/></p>
<u>Have we succeeded before?</u>
<p>My most recent design &amp; produce development success with OS&amp;B was the Island Drain, a new drain debuting in late 2013 that secures to the floor and allows reversible installation of the those big standalone tubs without access from below. This certified drain is a hit success all across North America, in this just its first year of sales. From concept to hit product in mere months.</p>
<p><u>Will the Diverta happen?</u></p>
<p>A Diverta shower drain is unlike other shower drains: the customer has to need it instead of a regular drain.  Normally for a new product, OEM customers, or wholesalers, or even contractors will provide that crucial first order.  <br/></p>
<p>Half of the journey in getting a green drain to market for gardeners is bridging the big gap between the manufacturer and the home owner/interior designer team.   The traditional plumbing products people are not going to be pioneers in this product without some pull from gardeners needing it. Toward this end, I will be presenting on the concepts of shower water diverters at North America's largest show, the 2015 Kitchen and Bath Show this January in Las Vegas.  <br/></p>
<p>This will be the starting point for the Indiegogo campaign to gather public interest in seeing this drain built.  <br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Climate change is affecting our everyday environment.  Some places in North America are wetter, some, like California &amp; Arizona, are in desperate need of simple, safe, and economical tools to promote water conservation.  And yet gardeners have to garden to avoid moonscaping of their communities.  That's green too.</p>
<p>The Diverta Shower Drain delivers both water conservation and water to garden.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We've come a long way in developing a compact shower water diverting drain that will make a lot of people who want to reuse shower water happy.</p>
<div>
<div>This drain is the fruit of years of experimentation and development, accompanied by careful alterations to the relevant drain standard (and so too the building codes that refer to it), and finally independent third party testing on the prototype to see if the proposed product would pass certification.  All necessary manufacturing quotes have been gathered from regular suppliers and compared.  Accordingly, the greatest risk is the gap between financial investment and product sales.  The information gap between gardener and indoor plumbing is larger than regular for a novel drain, where plumbers promote products they know.  And yet gardeners must have this fitting to safely divert shower without putting their house at risk.  <span>So here's our path:</span>

We have a two-person Finnish family company Living Spaces Ltd together with my wife Sanna. Our furniture project started when two people with special skills met each other. Collaboration as a couple in a product development quest proved to be a blessing. I'd like to introduce our new innovation in the field of upholstered furniture.</p><p>Owning a couch has many challenges. I and my wife Sanna were both moving quite a lot. Carrying heavy upholstered furniture was such a drag that I often abandoned sofa into a recycling centre before relocation. Sanna gave away her modular sectional because it was full of animal allergens. Her previous bed sofa was destroyed by a cat's claws. Our latest sofa was ruined by wet hair which caused dark rings to emerge into the upholstery. After our daughter hurt her head to sofa arm while bouncing on the couch we decided we had enough of traditional sofas.</p><p>We wanted to give our daughter the most educative, active and safe environment possible. We also wanted complete, unlimited freedom to decide how we would like to use the living room.</p><p><strong>After five years of intensive research and development, the BiT is complete</strong></p><p>Definition of <i>couch</i> according to Merriam-Webster dictionary: <i>An article of furniture for sitting or </i><i>reclining.</i></p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our idea was to create furniture that could be reformed to meet everyone's daily needs regardless of age. We put safety and cleanability to our first priority.  Safetyness and low weight were achieved by making every piece frameless. That, in turn, helped to leave out lots of traditional sofa's components: <strong>BiT doesn't contain glue, wood, paints, lacquer or solvents.</strong> </span><font>Our sub-contractors use high-quality materials with production methods specially developed for BiT elements. Manufacturers are working continuously and closely to further develop production methods and logistics. </font></p><p>BiT adapts to a variety of everyday situations such as surprise guests, changing social situations, children's physical play and demanding project and gaming environments. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> We wanted a soft companion to follow us everywhere for years instead of months. The sofa shouldn't be a disposable product. <strong> </strong></span></p><p>In our home, we use the living room actively. Sanna piles elements away when she's doing yoga or dance. She constructs a table from the BiT elements for fabric cutting when she has an inspiration to sew. Our four-year-old daughter Taika is primarily constructing huts, castles and ball pits with her friends. I build different project-specific home offices and simulation game cabins for tournaments with neighbors. </p><p>Having this type of construction freedom has provided us with lots of joy and a socially active lifestyle. Through this Indiegogo project, we'd like to share this reshapeable furniture set with You. We sincerely hope You can experience the same comfort, happiness and laughter we've had during these testing years with BiT elements.</p><p>The BiT has permanently changed the way we use our living space and brought a whole new functional way to spend time with family and friends. Wardrobe full of mattresses for guests, inflatable (and leaking) extra beds and next to impossible couch cleaning projects are all things in the past.</p><p>Together we can expand the definition of the <i>couch</i>.</p><p><strong>For gamers everywhere: </strong>We Salute You.

We have a two-person Finnish family company Living Spaces Ltd together with my wife Sanna. Our furniture project started when two people with special skills met each other. Collaboration as a couple in a product development quest proved to be a blessing. I'd like to introduce our new innovation in the field of upholstered furniture.Owning a couch has many challenges. I and my wife Sanna were both moving quite a lot. Carrying heavy upholstered furniture was such a drag that I often abandoned sofa into a recycling centre before relocation. Sanna gave away her modular sectional because it was full of animal allergens. Her previous bed sofa was destroyed by a cat's claws. Our latest sofa was ruined by wet hair which caused dark rings to emerge into the upholstery. After our daughter hurt her head to sofa arm while bouncing on the couch we decided we had enough of traditional sofas.We wanted to give our daughter the most educative, active and safe environment possible. We also wanted complete, unlimited freedom to decide how we would like to use the living room.After five years of intensive research and development, the BiT is completeDefinition of couch according to Merriam-Webster dictionary: An article of furniture for sitting or reclining.Our idea was to create furniture that could be reformed to meet everyone's daily needs regardless of age. We put safety and cleanability to our first priority.  Safetyness and low weight were achieved by making every piece frameless. That, in turn, helped to leave out lots of traditional sofa's components: BiT doesn't contain glue, wood, paints, lacquer or solvents. Our sub-contractors use high-quality materials with production methods specially developed for BiT elements. Manufacturers are working continuously and closely to further develop production methods and logistics. BiT adapts to a variety of everyday situations such as surprise guests, changing social situations, children's physical play and demanding project and gaming environments.  We wanted a soft companion to follow us everywhere for years instead of months. The sofa shouldn't be a disposable product.  In our home, we use the living room actively. Sanna piles elements away when she's doing yoga or dance. She constructs a table from the BiT elements for fabric cutting when she has an inspiration to sew. Our four-year-old daughter Taika is primarily constructing huts, castles and ball pits with her friends. I build different project-specific home offices and simulation game cabins for tournaments with neighbors. Having this type of construction freedom has provided us with lots of joy and a socially active lifestyle. Through this Indiegogo project, we'd like to share this reshapeable furniture set with You. We sincerely hope You can experience the same comfort, happiness and laughter we've had during these testing years with BiT elements.The BiT has permanently changed the way we use our living space and brought a whole new functional way to spend time with family and friends. Wardrobe full of mattresses for guests, inflatable (and leaking) extra beds and next to impossible couch cleaning projects are all things in the past.Together we can expand the definition of the couch.For gamers everywhere: We Salute You. Sit back and enjoy!Risks: During these five years we have overcome a lot of challenges. Our manufacturers have tested every phase and they are ready to start the production.

Water bottle in the rack, mineral water, soft drinks on one side of the MrCoolit can dispensers and it’s all so easy for them to use - not to mention keeping those little fingers from freezing. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The drinks come out of the cooler with tiny icicles having direct contact with the product ensuring the drinks are just like you have pulled them out of a normal cooler full of ice.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">“YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT ICE”</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Just think how many times you open the lid; well it’s pretty simple every time you need to get a can or bottle. When you do need to open the lid the ice cold shelf gives a protective ice cold shield from the ice below.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The game changer.</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Going on family holidays has been a tradition for 30 years. Two years ago my brother Clint and I were watching Josh, my son going through the cooler - well we were all laughing! His hands were frozen by the time he got his can. Clint turned to me and said ""mate, we can fix this"", and that’s the moment the MrCoolit concept was created. We have brought high end coolers as long as they have been around and use them on camping holidays, fishing trips - you name it! Every day, the lid is constantly opened by us and the kids and unless is kept closed the ice melts quickly and we're replacing it every day in the heat of summer. Since then we have designed the systems to maximise the ice preservation so you can use it and make the most out of an expensive high end cooler.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We have put a lot of thought into high end coolers and they're great!  It is no doubt the best ice preservation you can buy and we are still replacing the ice!  Frozen hands, soggy and wasted food - all because everyone is using it... and now we have improved it out of sight!  </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">MrCoolit lasts 3 to 4+ times longer than any other cooler when using it, and it will still do its original function if you choose to close it up.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">                        </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Let’s go through it.</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478744602/awtd0r4pjmxblt5edrus.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Renderings</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477110177/ygnfu9dh01pejlt44xyn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>COOLIT Can Dispensing System​</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i65.tinypic.com/w0p7o0.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What an ice saver</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">This is so easy to use; once you load it up forget it!  “Ice cold cans not ice cold hands” is the perfect way to sum up how this works. After many years of digging around in the cooler looking for that illusive can and the chore replacing ice, we thought  there is a way to solve this and the MrCoolit can dispenser was created. It’s so effective and the can’s are perfectly chilled and crisp all without freezing your hands. Hot air is drawn to cold air so when you open the cooler lid it wants to get in, and once  it’s in there’s no escape. Ice cold air sinks to the bottom of the cooler so when you open the dispenser door to get your bottle or can, the cold air is blocking the hot air radically reducing the opportunity for hot air to get in - when you open the lid, then close it, you trap the hot air in.<strong> </strong>The  size difference between the can dispensing door opening and lid opening alone makes it an incredibly effective system.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We designed the MrCoolit can dispensers with a trap door inside the cooler so you can get the can’s and if there's one who is misbehaving you can easily fix it!  We use the slowly melting ice to our advantage, plastic mesh casings allow the icicles and ice cold water to have contact with cans and also blocking larger ice pieces from falling through jamming the can’s from rolling into position.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">COOLIT Bottle Storage</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/qK0eAwC.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It's all about the ice</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Not everyone drinks cans and having access to water, soft drinks, wine or any other bottled drink was a major consideration when designing MrCoolit, creating an easy to use and accessible bottle rack system with out opening the lid, freezing your hands and trapping in the hot air was just as important. The same principles apply as the can dispenser with the cold air being pushed out and blocking the hot air all while your bottle is being perfectly chilled and crisp.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Storing a massive 1.5 litre bottle is a huge advantage, having the capacity to keep hydrated on those scorching hot  summer days and being able to access  ice chilled water to quench your thirst and knowing your not burning through your ice supply .”We love saying that part!” .</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">                    </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Cooler</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/aOfagg0.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Heart</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">This is all about performance and having the best possible support system you can buy in ice coolers.  The cooler is in the centre of any adventure with family and friends no matter where you go - camping, fishing, hunting or BBQ’s,  it’s the most used item you take and depend on.  Everyone’s using it and that’s the reason why we created MrCoolit.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">This cooler has awesome quality and performance from having duel seal’s in the lid;  double insulation thickness lid to provide double insulation from the top where most radiant heat enters the box;  high density multi compound polyurethane insulation injected under high pressure; dual seal feature creates air lock between seals;  separate high quality food grade inner liner;  large bung with 'O' ring threaded to access tap water;  fully integrated anchor points;  marine grade stainless steel latch's for locking down lid and fully molded hinges with corrosion resistant pins.  You are investing in a commercial grade ice box!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Entertainment</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478216765/jiwjb6eyymrgfxkbztj2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Soul</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">This is where we thought what do you need; one of the most important things is power and light.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Having a powerful solar charging lithium battery on board is the way to go - place it out in the sun for top up charging and take it literally anywhere you go!  It has 100000 mAh of grunt; it’s portable, accessible and has plenty of features.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The LED in this is amazing, the ambient light it cast’s enough to light up the campsite for everyone with out blinding you, no more holding the torch when your tying on your hook and it will last 10 hrs + off a full battery - the illuminated push button  on/off switch is a nice touch and looks really cool.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Having built in USB 2.0 ports and the power to back them up is a perfect way to all keep charged all of the time.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Waterproof blue tooth speaker - this is a mini speaker with great sound to keep everyone in the groove.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Keeping your phone in a safe place to charge and out of the sun with easy access in a ventilated position keeping it cool, along with the battery in a separate position, to hold the doors closed.

Water bottle in the rack, mineral water, soft drinks on one side of the MrCoolit can dispensers and it’s all so easy for them to use - not to mention keeping those little fingers from freezing. The drinks come out of the cooler with tiny icicles having direct contact with the product ensuring the drinks are just like you have pulled them out of a normal cooler full of ice.“YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT ICE”Just think how many times you open the lid; well it’s pretty simple every time you need to get a can or bottle. When you do need to open the lid the ice cold shelf gives a protective ice cold shield from the ice below. The StoryThe game changer.Going on family holidays has been a tradition for 30 years. Two years ago my brother Clint and I were watching Josh, my son going through the cooler - well we were all laughing! His hands were frozen by the time he got his can. Clint turned to me and said ""mate, we can fix this"", and that’s the moment the MrCoolit concept was created. We have brought high end coolers as long as they have been around and use them on camping holidays, fishing trips - you name it! Every day, the lid is constantly opened by us and the kids and unless is kept closed the ice melts quickly and we're replacing it every day in the heat of summer. Since then we have designed the systems to maximise the ice preservation so you can use it and make the most out of an expensive high end cooler.We have put a lot of thought into high end coolers and they're great!  It is no doubt the best ice preservation you can buy and we are still replacing the ice!  Frozen hands, soggy and wasted food - all because everyone is using it... and now we have improved it out of sight!  MrCoolit lasts 3 to 4+ times longer than any other cooler when using it, and it will still do its original function if you choose to close it up.                        Let’s go through it. Renderings COOLIT Can Dispensing System​ What an ice saverThis is so easy to use; once you load it up forget it!  “Ice cold cans not ice cold hands” is the perfect way to sum up how this works. After many years of digging around in the cooler looking for that illusive can and the chore replacing ice, we thought  there is a way to solve this and the MrCoolit can dispenser was created. It’s so effective and the can’s are perfectly chilled and crisp all without freezing your hands. Hot air is drawn to cold air so when you open the cooler lid it wants to get in, and once  it’s in there’s no escape. Ice cold air sinks to the bottom of the cooler so when you open the dispenser door to get your bottle or can, the cold air is blocking the hot air radically reducing the opportunity for hot air to get in - when you open the lid, then close it, you trap the hot air in. The  size difference between the can dispensing door opening and lid opening alone makes it an incredibly effective system.We designed the MrCoolit can dispensers with a trap door inside the cooler so you can get the can’s and if there's one who is misbehaving you can easily fix it!  We use the slowly melting ice to our advantage, plastic mesh casings allow the icicles and ice cold water to have contact with cans and also blocking larger ice pieces from falling through jamming the can’s from rolling into position. COOLIT Bottle Storage It's all about the iceNot everyone drinks cans and having access to water, soft drinks, wine or any other bottled drink was a major consideration when designing MrCoolit, creating an easy to use and accessible bottle rack system with out opening the lid, freezing your hands and trapping in the hot air was just as important. The same principles apply as the can dispenser with the cold air being pushed out and blocking the hot air all while your bottle is being perfectly chilled and crisp.Storing a massive 1.5 litre bottle is a huge advantage, having the capacity to keep hydrated on those scorching hot  summer days and being able to access  ice chilled water to quench your thirst and knowing your not burning through your ice supply .”We love saying that part!” .                    The CoolerThe HeartThis is all about performance and having the best possible support system you can buy in ice coolers.  The cooler is in the centre of any adventure with family and friends no matter where you go - camping, fishing, hunting or BBQ’s,  it’s the most used item you take and depend on.  Everyone’s using it and that’s the reason why we created MrCoolit.This cooler has awesome quality and performance from having duel seal’s in the lid;  double insulation thickness lid to provide double insulation from the top where most radiant heat enters the box;  high density multi compound polyurethane insulation injected under high pressure; dual seal feature creates air lock between seals;  separate high quality food grade inner liner;  large bung with 'O' ring threaded to access tap water;  fully integrated anchor points;  marine grade stainless steel latch's for locking down lid and fully molded hinges with corrosion resistant pins.  You are investing in a commercial grade ice box!  EntertainmentThe SoulThis is where we thought what do you need; one of the most important things is power and light.Having a powerful solar charging lithium battery on board is the way to go - place it out in the sun for top up charging and take it literally anywhere you go!  It has 100000 mAh of grunt; it’s portable, accessible and has plenty of features.The LED in this is amazing, the ambient light it cast’s enough to light up the campsite for everyone with out blinding you, no more holding the torch when your tying on your hook and it will last 10 hrs + off a full battery - the illuminated push button  on/off switch is a nice touch and looks really cool.Having built in USB 2.0 ports and the power to back them up is a perfect way to all keep charged all of the time.Waterproof blue tooth speaker - this is a mini speaker with great sound to keep everyone in the groove.Keeping your phone in a safe place to charge and out of the sun with easy access in a ventilated position keeping it cool, along with the battery in a separate position, to hold the doors closed. We have used earth magnet’s - they are a perfect way of not using latches that can break or jam and these little magnets snap shut tight. Cool CartOptional - RRP $60.00Please Note:- Cool Cart is an additional cost of $51.00 to be added to both Perk purchases.After many, many years of carrying and using coolers with wheels  like an old shopping trolley after a week of heavy work - dragging them all through rough terrain… and we can't say coolers are not heavy when there packed, they weigh a ton!  Designing the right tool for the job was something we felt was long overdue.  The cool cart is designed for the long run and to be used as a multi-versatile tool.  The diameter of the wheels give great clearance and ease going over almost any surface. With a detachable handle from the base frame to make life easy if your setting up to travel.  It’s a tough unit! The Perks  Why We Need Your HelpOur investment into MrCoolit to date is $105K USD, which we hope you shows our commitment to the project. We have secured the Cooler manufacturer and they are one of the best!Techni Ice for those who don't know them - they a Global leader in Cooler's. The question has been raised, how do we deal with the crowdfunding controversy with a project that is a similar product to ours, this is how.MrCoolit has no investment to make in the cooler box. We have a supply arrangement with Techni  Ice Australia a division of  Global National Australia. Pty Ltd.Our most costly investment is the tooling, and investing in parts and components will be purchased according to the orders generated. Assembly and infrastructure will be accommodated to the required level to ensure production flow and efficiency on all levels.    Its time for us to ask for your help to make this project a reality and to manufacture the first cooler of its kind. With your help, we can revolutionize the industry in ice coolers.We have done our due-diligence on costing and understand the costs associated with a product with many parts and expensive investments in tooling molds, and all necessary components and infrastructure to get MrCoolit ready to go. Our family have a great deal of experience in the refrigeration and cooling industry completing  100s of specialized project’s over the last 50 years!  We have all been involved in this project  and we all know if you build a cheap product it shows sooner rather than later, this why our price reflects the quality of MrCoolit.Your contributions will help us bring MrCoolit to the production phase and into so many campsites, BBQ‘s, fishing trips all the outdoor adventures you can think of all over the world with family and friends – now that’s cool. The Schedule The TeamTroy has been involved in refrigeration since he was a small boy growing up in the industry with Glenn his father who designed and manufactured fruit ripening system's in the 80's.  Keeping products cold and fresh is his passion, with extensive experience in design and manufacturing and he has also obtained an Associate Degree of Applied Science Refrigeration at Oklahoma State University.     Clint also grew up in the refrigeration industry as a little fella with his father Glenn working and learning, took another path in the glass industry, accumulating many national awards in innovation, design and manufacturing.  He has come back to the family roots of the cold and fresh industry designing systems with Troy to bring you MrCoolit.Eddie has been running a successful business since the ripe old age of 20 in diverse industries and has been a family friend of the Troy and Clint for 20 years.  He is experienced in team management with great skill in accounting and an all rounder.  He brings a wealth of knowledge to the team.The three of us have all been camping our whole lives and that is what brings this team together for we have all had similar experiences over the years. And we believe it's time to bring  MrCoolit to the people! Managing The ProjectWe have dedicated a great deal of time and knowledge to put in place the necessary procedures to minimize the risks and unforeseen challenges of a project like MrCoolit.Our price and schedule are based on years of experience, development, fine tuning and strategy.This is not to say we will we will simply put this together, but if we can get a home ground advantage this sure will give us the edge.In a lot of ways this has been a complex project and in other ways it has come together beautifully giving us the confidence in our design, product and the way we will deliver MrCoolit to the awesome indiegogo community and beyond. Fine Tuning & AdjustmentsIn general there will be a few adjustments along the way and we have put the right team together to handle these moments swiftly.  We don’t see problems only challenges and fortunately we have ironed out most of the kinks before we begin.We have allocated the time in testing MrCoolit and the results are outstanding.  From a number of BBQ tests, having quite a few cans and bottles put through the dispensers from family and friends at home, to the hot room for days on end of testing.  We're happy and positive you will be. F.A.Q.Q.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>After asking his aging mother how she checks the water in her Christmas tree stand, Ted Sullivan, owner and creator of the Evergreen Elf, learned that she was risking her knees and back climbing over presents and under branches only to discover the tree was bone dry.</p>
<p>That same year when his wife asked him to check the water repeatedly in his own tree stand, he was determined to make life easier for everyone. Realizing the importance of keeping his family and his extended family safe, he developed a new way to check the water in the Christmas tree stand and the Evergreen Elf was born.</p>

We all love the benefits of a live Christmas tree - the fresh scent, the festive beauty and it's better for the environment! But we are all guilty from time to time of not giving our tree the attention it needs during the holidays. During the holiday hustle and bustle, remembering to check the tree becomes a chore.
Forgetting to water has caused over 17 million dollars in damages each year! Evergreen Elf was created to take the chore out of monitoring the water level in your tree stand, keeping your tree fresh and your family safe

Our Story
After asking his aging mother how she checks the water in her Christmas tree stand, Ted Sullivan, owner and creator of the Evergreen Elf, learned that she was risking her knees and back climbing over presents and under branches only to discover the tree was bone dry.
That same year when his wife asked him to check the water repeatedly in his own tree stand, he was determined to make life easier for everyone. Realizing the importance of keeping his family and his extended family safe, he developed a new way to check the water in the Christmas tree stand and the Evergreen Elf was born.

<p>Hey there! My names Kennedy Gillette and I’m a young mother from Upstate NY. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has managed to knock our family off of our feet making this start-up exceedingly difficult. Since I’m the full-time caretaker of our daughter while her father works, I haven’t been able to bring any income into our family and I would really like to change that.</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed candle making and I’ve studied the process for quite some time now. If I’m able to get some help for the start-up costs of equipment I’ll be opening my own handmade candle shop online. All of my products are made with 100% Organic/Natural waxes, fragrances, essential oils, and dyes. I also plan on setting up a program where returning customers can send their glass gars back to be repurposed for a discount on their next order!</p>
<p>There will be different sections on my product page for “New Candles” or “Repurposed Candles” and with the goal of being 100% eco-friendly in mind I will be using hemp or wooden wicks with recyclable labels. My ultimate goal is to set up a good future for my daughter, and I believe opening a business that I truly enjoy will push our family in a positive direction!</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>The initial challenge I’m facing is start-up costs. Occasionally, a candle may be accidentally poured improperly. However, I will be using reusable containers, along with eco-friendly hemp/wooden wics and 100% organic soy wax and beeswax! No product is wasted as I can give imperfect candles to local community members for free, and the jars can be sent back for reuse.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

The fact that the ball floats and spins without losing the spin or the height makes it come alive and thus brings more life into the room. By using marble in combination with metal optics, HYFER Globe stands for modernity and simplicity by still impressing the viewer.-""It reminds you that the world keeps turning no matter what.""  Hi! We are Elisabeth and Elvedin, two students from the Technical University of Munich. We founded HYFER because of our interest in technology combined with our vision to give everyone around the world a bit of life back. We are so happy that we achieved so much in such a short time and that we can present you our heart project! We are both curious and motivated to put our complete energy into this project and we want to see HYFER Globe in places all around the globe! Please back us and let's achieve this goal together!   The sphere is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. It stays at its place and spins around its axis. You can place your hand between the sphere and the base without deflecting it. Due to this technology HYFER Globe can even hang on a wall.-""Lifting force and stability in perfect balance.""  The ball still hovers in the middle, with the same distance in-between and it doesn’t fall down. If HYFER Globe hasn't been an eye-catcher so far, it certainly is now!  
 

 
We started to develop a simple but symbolic design and integrated the magnetic technology. This is the reason why HYFER Globe looks and fascinates exactly the way it does. 
A lot of time passed until we were satisfied with our prototypes. Founding a company next to our studies gave us more and a totally different kind of motivation to aim for the best results. With assistance from our friends, family and people from our university we were able to make it this far, now we need your help! We have put a lot of time, passion and commitment into this product and the only thing missing is start-up capital to finally start the production of HYFER Globe.
-""Finally putting what you have learned into practice is inspiring.""
 
 There are numerous places where you can place HYFER Globe. These are just a few examples.  Pimp up the atmosphere in your clinic’s waiting room. It is a stressful situation for most of your patients anyways so let them be reminded that everything will be fine.   HYFER Globe is perfect for your home office. Inducing more energy around you and revitalizing your work desk.  The first thing people see when they enter a room is important. Or as we say in Germany “der erste Eindruck zählt”. Let them be impressed by having HYFER Globe hovering right in front of them. They will remember you!  The living room is a place where we spend a lot of time. It is where we feel home. Where we feel safe. So there is no place as important as the heart of our house. Let it be special and give it a living touch, to support the calming atmosphere.  Not only a simple vase for your shelves again. Bring them to the next level, by including HYFER Globe. One, two or more. Whatever you like most!  Complete your spa day with the magic of HYFER Globe. Next to candles it can hover and make every second a little more precious to you. There is nothing more important than caring about yourself, so do it perfectly.  Fun fact: we gifted our first products and prototypes to our family and friends. It is an ideal gift for different occasions, as a birthday present, for a wedding, for a new home, as a company gift or just to say “Thank you!” to somebody.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to deliver the product before Christmas, but this does not mean that you cannot give it away for Christmas anyway. HYFER Globe is worth waiting for. We have designed a gift card for this purpose. You can select this option at the checkout and we will send you the card via e-mail.  There are four different designs you can choose from: Black and silver like the moon at night. White and gold like the sun during the day. Black and gold like a star at night. White and silver like a cloud in the sky.  Through the marble design we ensure that each product has a unique aspect and that each person receives that uniqueness. Additionally, as a healing stone for the soul, marble is used in the areas of courage and new beginnings. White marble shows new perspectives and paves the way for a change of life. It helps to find imaginative solutions to problems and thus contributes to more satisfaction.These facts have inspired us to integrate exactly this into our product.-""Hover unique.""  Due to the handy size, the HYFER Globe can shine by its appearance. You can place it anywhere in your home without it looking too obtrusive. Even more than one can be perfectly integrated into your home.-""Small but excellent.""  The hexagonal base makes HYFER Globe a modular product, which makes it possible to place several pieces next to each other, switch the spheres and still look chic. Mix different coloured products or let all shine in one colour.-""Strong together."" The symbol of the sphere means the totality of all possibilities in the finite world, eternity and the cyclical movement of renewal. Through the colour gold, spheres also represent the personality of the hero or heroine in fairy tales. This symbolism, we find, reflects even more the strong appearance of our product.-""In antiquity the sphere was considered the soul of the world.""  Let HYFER Globe impress you even more with the reflection of the sphere in the base. The polished-look acts like a mirror and it almost seems like there are two spheres.  As a German company, we care a lot about quality. It is just as important as the design and the technology of the product. Without it, the product would lose its beauty. Each product will be checked and tested before it is sent to you to ensure the best possible quality. You shouldn't expect less, so HYFER Globe can be the eyecatcher of every room it “lives” inside. Take the ball carefully in both hands.Slowly move your hands (starting at around 20cm/8inches distance) towards the middle of the base until a counter-pressure is felt.Now carefully release the ball.    We are excited to be offering free, international shipping.

riflo: an organic embodiment of Now & Here 
It’s often inconvenient to open apps on smartphones or computers to connect to appliances. So we develop affordable and easy-to-use products that are able to recognize signals simultaneously and respond to them as you desire. As more devices become internet-connected, the various digital signals surrounding us will increase exponentially. Easy ways will become desirable to deal with all these signals.Our first project is ‘riflo’-What is riflo?It’s a totally unique combination of a speaker and a multi-color LED light fixture that is wifi-controlled.-Why riflo?The name is a combination of ”ripple and flow” which is about visualizing spreading signals.) Once you put a riflo(bulb) into a socket in your living room or over your dining table, you’ll marvel at how. you can turn on its unique functions at your command with the sleek hand-held button(controller).Relax to the lovely light settings and beautiful music riflo delivers. Voice messages, too. It even winks at you.  And your user preferences will be retained in riflo’s memory and become a natural part of your life style.
-About riflo
We created riflo to be communicative. riflo is the first system that flows the users’ experience.


Key Features








Wink
 

Wink comes up in color signal when there is necessary information for you. You can simply ignore it or keep it connected.


Automate this


The Wink function comes up in color signal when there is necessary information for you. You can simply ignore it or keep it connected.




Voice Message


The Voice Message function will let you know the information you’ve told riflo you seek, such as schedules, weather reports, or your very own wake-up alarm. Moreover, you can play recorded sounds with an app when ever you desire.


“Today’s weather is cloudy. The lowest temperature is 73.4℉(23℃) and the highest is 89.6℉(32℃). The probability of rain is 70%.”
“Charles arrives in 3 minutes.”

“Tomorrow is our wedding anniversary.”
At 12pm, your message “It’s time to eat your sandwich. You’ll find it  in the refrigerator.” will be played in your child’s room.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We’ve worked hard and personally committed $20,000 to this project so far. Our project has a number of risks typically associated with Hardware startups. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We’ve outlined a few risks and challenges below and given in detail how we plan to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><b>Insufficient Initial Capital:  </b></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Risk Mitigation: The most expensive components are the moulds required for the enclosure and the PCB. We have spent a lot of time perfecting our prototype and the designs we have for the enclosure and PCB are ready for manufacturing in terms of design and quality. This eliminates unexpected costs and delays caused due to a major redesign.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For rewards, most backers will get instantaneous, exclusive access to a hosted, secure video-conferencing program. This is one of the most robust, secure video-conferencing solutions in the market and will allow you to conference with your friends and family, no matter where they are. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This instantaneous access ensures that we have the ability to provide you a nice perk right away, the moment you back us. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><b>Manufacturing delays: </b></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Manufacturing delays can be caused due to numerous reasons, including major redesign and availability of parts.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Risk Mitigation: Our designs are ready for launch and our suppliers have informed us that they can supply adequate quantities for large scale manufacturing. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The first few releases of Hexastor will come with a modified version of Syncthing built into it. Syncthing is open source and is supported by a large community of software developers and users and this allows us to improve the product for the community that uses it and also gives our developers more time to focus on the security stack. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The security stack is an important application that makes Hexastor so secure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484636785/xupypcf2p7fxp4qnerbi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We would like you to be a part of our success story. Share using the links above and help us reach our target goal to allow us to bring this incredible device to reality.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484636805/qqprmddeghdyg06tc3hl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>1. Tell us more about your team</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Hexastor is run by a bunch of people who believe that secure data storage and video-chat should be available and easily accessible at all times.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We have to admit that we are not the first ones to launch a 'personal cloud storage' device but we can promise you a device that's unique in terms of features, compactness, ease to use and extensibility. Most other devices fail to do that.</p>
<p><strong>2. What do you mean by a prototype? How close is the prototype for manufacturing?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We worked on the first paper napkin design and made a 3D prototype in February 2016.<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>A four layer circuit board was designed and samples were burn-in tested in January 2016. This testing allowed us to make further improvements to the final circuit board design which was ready by February 2016.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The final prototypes you see include production-ready internal components with 3D printed exterior shells.  So we are almost ready to produce these devices and need additional funds to engage manufacturers and suppliers who are motivated and are on standby. </p>
<p><strong>3. Give us a technical overview of how this device works </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We love open source, so we compiled our own Linux kernel and customised Syncthing for our device. Syncthing is hosted as an isolated container that sits on top of encrypted disks. The second container runs webRTC for video-conferencing and data in transit is always encrypted via a 256-bit tunnel.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The good news is that we have recycled a lot of open-source stuff and this will allow us to focus us on usability. Source code will be made available for free for everyone and we plan to contribute back to the open source community by releasing bug-fixes and enhancements.  </p>
<p><strong>4. What is a Pi image and how do I use it?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A Pi image converts a Raspberry Pi 3 into a Hexastor device. We strongly recommend a 16 gigabyte class-10 microSD card for installation. Insert the microSD card into your Windows / Mac machine using an adapter and run the wizard to setup Hexastor.  This version of Hexastor does not support the video-chat feature.</p>

The result is a tiny, portable device that doesn’t require much power and is easy to configure and use. Hexastor stands for Highly EXtensible STORage.  

 
 


 

 

 

 
 


 


 



We’ve worked hard and personally committed $20,000 to this project so far. Our project has a number of risks typically associated with Hardware startups. 
We’ve outlined a few risks and challenges below and given in detail how we plan to mitigate these risks.
Insufficient Initial Capital:  
Risk Mitigation: The most expensive components are the moulds required for the enclosure and the PCB. We have spent a lot of time perfecting our prototype and the designs we have for the enclosure and PCB are ready for manufacturing in terms of design and quality. This eliminates unexpected costs and delays caused due to a major redesign.
For rewards, most backers will get instantaneous, exclusive access to a hosted, secure video-conferencing program. This is one of the most robust, secure video-conferencing solutions in the market and will allow you to conference with your friends and family, no matter where they are. 
This instantaneous access ensures that we have the ability to provide you a nice perk right away, the moment you back us. 
Manufacturing delays: 
Manufacturing delays can be caused due to numerous reasons, including major redesign and availability of parts.
Risk Mitigation: Our designs are ready for launch and our suppliers have informed us that they can supply adequate quantities for large scale manufacturing. 
The first few releases of Hexastor will come with a modified version of Syncthing built into it. Syncthing is open source and is supported by a large community of software developers and users and this allows us to improve the product for the community that uses it and also gives our developers more time to focus on the security stack. 
The security stack is an important application that makes Hexastor so secure.
 

We would like you to be a part of our success story. Share using the links above and help us reach our target goal to allow us to bring this incredible device to reality.
 
 
1. Tell us more about your team
Hexastor is run by a bunch of people who believe that secure data storage and video-chat should be available and easily accessible at all times.
We have to admit that we are not the first ones to launch a 'personal cloud storage' device but we can promise you a device that's unique in terms of features, compactness, ease to use and extensibility. Most other devices fail to do that.
2. What do you mean by a prototype? How close is the prototype for manufacturing?
We worked on the first paper napkin design and made a 3D prototype in February 2016.A four layer circuit board was designed and samples were burn-in tested in January 2016. This testing allowed us to make further improvements to the final circuit board design which was ready by February 2016.
The final prototypes you see include production-ready internal components with 3D printed exterior shells.  So we are almost ready to produce these devices and need additional funds to engage manufacturers and suppliers who are motivated and are on standby. 
3. Give us a technical overview of how this device works 
We love open source, so we compiled our own Linux kernel and customised Syncthing for our device. Syncthing is hosted as an isolated container that sits on top of encrypted disks. The second container runs webRTC for video-conferencing and data in transit is always encrypted via a 256-bit tunnel.
The good news is that we have recycled a lot of open-source stuff and this will allow us to focus us on usability. Source code will be made available for free for everyone and we plan to contribute back to the open source community by releasing bug-fixes and enhancements.  
4. What is a Pi image and how do I use it?
A Pi image converts a Raspberry Pi 3 into a Hexastor device. We strongly recommend a 16 gigabyte class-10 microSD card for installation. Insert the microSD card into your Windows / Mac machine using an adapter and run the wizard to setup Hexastor.  This version of Hexastor does not support the video-chat feature.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

That says battery life is up to 1 year on an average use of 15 times access per day. You will also get low battery alert via beeps and notifications in app when the Appli can still be unlocked/locked for 50 times more.Can the Appli replace the old deadbolt door lock?Yes, you can simply install Appli in place of the original Deadbolt door lock.Can I see the information of the people who came in through the door lock?Yes, you can use the bridge connected to the Appli to see the photos and times of the people coming in through the Appli in real time.Does the Appli have anti-thief function?Yes, if the Appli is slightly away from the door by an outside intruder, alarm will sound.How many users can be registered?Appli can register up to 50 users.After an external intruder sees the PIN code input from afar, can he mimic it to open the Appli?No, Appli's PIN code layout changes randomly every time, so he can’t open the door even if imitated.How can guest send the door unlock request?When the screen is turned on by pressing the power button, a phone icon appears on the bottom right of the LCD. If you touch the icon, a request to open a door with your photo will be sent to the phone connected with Appli.If I am outside and the battery is fully discharged, what can I do to unlock the Appli?You can use the emergency power connector to power the Appli.How can I use remote unlock/lock functionality?This is very simple. You can use your phone to lock/unlock the Appli, even if you are everywhere.How much is the size of Appli?Outside is 185.3mm(height) x 74.2mm(width) x 48mm(depth), inside is 160mm(height) x 80mm(width) x 35.5mm(depth).How long is the warranty of Appli?1 yearWhere can be shipped for Appli?It is possible for Appli to ship worldwide.Can I lock/unlock Appli using my phone directly?Yes, you can directly lock/unlock the Appli by using the app that we provide on the phone with Bluetooth 4.How are personal data such as user's face data stored and transferred?Personal data is stored in an encrypted form in the only Appli itself and is not backed up or transmitted to others.The user's log data is also transferred in encrypted form and only the user with the appropriate privilege can view it. The control by bluetooth is also proceeded safely based on 2-way authentication.Does the Appli have a battery alert functionality?Yes, if the Appli is turned on when the battery is below any limit, the “Battery is Low” alarm is displayed on the LCD.It also sends an alert to phone connected on the Appli through Bridge.Are iOS and Android app available?Yes, you can download the apps from App store or Google store.Does Appli integrate with Apple Home Kit?No yet. If we are successful on the campaign, this work will be next stage.Does Appli integrate with Amazon Echo? No yet. If we are successful on the campaign, this work will be next stage.Can a person trick Appli with a picture of me? No. Any picture of a registered host can’t be tricked Appli.How Secure is personal data in Appli and how does Appli Security respect my privacy? Appli stores user’s face data on the device’s internal storage in an encrypted format and does not transfer or store it on the Cloud. No one can get the facial stored data from the Appli’s internal storage and even if someone succeeded to get it, they cannot recover the original facial data from it because of encryption. When using Appli, user’s face image thumbnail is transferred to IBM Cloud server as a log and it can be read on the phone by only the authorized and registered user. Furthermore, the resolution of face image thumbnail that is transferred as a log is very small, so it cannot be used as personal information.Bluetooth connection is established through two ways & two-layer encryption, so an unauthorized phone or device cannot be connected to Appli. Authorized devices can only issue commands such as unlock and lock so the user’s privacy data is protected thoroughly.During the development process of Appli, we have consulted thoroughly with lawyers in the field of user’s privacy and now we can assure that we never collect or leak out any privacy data.We will do our best to assure customers that our products are safe.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Keep messages on your desk</h3>
<p>Welcome to the next step of messaging. Flushino is a desk notes machine that turns your average texts into a real experience. With features like built-in Wi-Fi, bluetooth and offline queue you will never miss a message, anywhere you will be, at home or at your office. </p>
<p>Flushino is very easy to use, all you need is a Wi-Fi connection and a socket, then you are ready to start receiving messages. It is the first device of its category, you can use it for a large variety of purposes, from business messages to text your girlfriend.<br/>Keep messages on your desk, the revolution of messaging is coming, are you joining ?</p>
<h3>The past in the future</h3>
<p>When I thought Flushino, I was inspired from two inventions that belong to the past: the fax and  the voicemail. My intention was to give birth a new way to communicate giving the right emphasis to important messages that often are treated like any other.</p>
<p>I called it Flushino because of the ancient idiom ""<i>Panta rhei</i> "" that we can translate as ""Everything flows"", the word flush is used in that sense, the paper flows as the whole thing. The final part ""ino"" derives from the fact that it is a small device and in Italy we use to put ""ino"" at the end of the words for tiny objects. </p>
<p>If you have to tell something to somebody use Flushino! </p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The configuration of Flushino is very simple, The first step is to teach to Flushino the name of your WiFi network, to do that we have designed a specific application that uses the bluetooth of your phone.</p>
<p> <a href=""https://gifyu.com/image/wyhm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549912799/ortwwhdykq98kyi7tdh1.png"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p>This step can be also performed via WPS button that will be added when the production chain will begin. Then you are ready to receive some messages from your friends, colleagues and so on.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549904243/ylybon4u6pueooskkzyr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Send a message</h3>
<p>Flushino works with a telegram bot, in this way send messages is very easy !<br/>Open the Telegram application and look for Flushino bot. Start the bot and specify the address of your Flushino, it is indicated at the rear of your packaging. You have now associated your device with the Flushino bot  the work is done.</p>
<p><a href=""https://gifyu.com/image/wyhm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""ezgif-5-c63ce4f08dd9.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s2.gifyu.com/images/ezgif-5-c63ce4f08dd9.gif"" src=""""/></a></p>
<h3>Printing Images</h3>
<p>Flushino is also able to print images, like emoji and small images. You can print out black &amp; white photos without wasting any ink cartridge because Flushino works with the heat!</p>
<p><a href=""https://gifyu.com/image/wyVR"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""ezgif-5-4e0d887658cf.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s2.gifyu.com/images/ezgif-5-4e0d887658cf.gif"" src=""""/></a></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've been modular during the design process, have built and tested the prototype for more than a month, have established a network of partners designing a true timeline, but there are always risks that can delay the process before Flushino gets into your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong>: The prototype worked very well, however I want to design all in one PCB  for industrialization and unexpected problems may emerge. A WPS button will also be added during the review of the hardware to make the configuration easier.</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong>: So far I have produced just two prototypes that I gave to my friend to know their response, when the production chain will start, a bigger series of devices will need some small changes and some risks related to the producers.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong>: We would like to improve the package design for the future models, an idea could be make the box of wood making Flushino looks like a vintage product.</p>
<p>But don’t worry: I will do all the necessary to ensure that Flushino will be a high quality product when it will be shipped.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549958151/zeoswn8sdvzfyfiozciq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I put a lot of effort dealing with the suppliers to keep as low as possible the price of a single Flushino. But that's not all, the crowdfunding campaign price includes also the FCC and CE certifications to guarantee the respect of applicable laws.<br/>But, even if we do not reach the final goal, you will put your hands on Flushino anyway. Your Flushino will be right there on your desk and will work every single day to transform your messaging  experience in the biggest way.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why you should support</span></p>
<p>I think the we can innovate our way to communicate, messages will be reality for everyone with Flushino.</p>
<p>Imagine the scene, you are on your sofa reading a book and suddenly you hear Flushino printing a message, so you stand up and run towards your desk to know who is texting you. Maybe is your wife that sends you a recipe for a new cake or maybe is your boss that congrats with you for the good job you did with the last deal.<br/>Using Flushino you will not waste ink as normal printers and you will reduce significantly wastes because a roll of paper can last up to a year with the average of 20 daily messages. Flushino will be the device with the lowest power consumption in your home due to its idle mode.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for joining the Flushino journey and helping us on our mission.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm now launching Flushino through Indiegogo to establish a community of early adopters and innovators. With your support we can finalize the development of our technology, produce and ship Flushino to you and take it to the next level. My vision is to introduce new and better devices for smart home that gives the right importance to communication.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Imagine to tell your wife that you love her, with Flushino your message will be taken into account more than a simple one on a screen. The communication on your Flushino is reserved to a little </span>élite of people that you will choose, this selection process improves the communication between fellows and make them feel closer.</p>

Welcome to the next step of messaging. Flushino is a desk notes machine that turns your average texts into a real experience. With features like built-in Wi-Fi, bluetooth and offline queue you will never miss a message, anywhere you will be, at home or at your office. 
Flushino is very easy to use, all you need is a Wi-Fi connection and a socket, then you are ready to start receiving messages. It is the first device of its category, you can use it for a large variety of purposes, from business messages to text your girlfriend.Keep messages on your desk, the revolution of messaging is coming, are you joining ?
The past in the future
When I thought Flushino, I was inspired from two inventions that belong to the past: the fax and  the voicemail. My intention was to give birth a new way to communicate giving the right emphasis to important messages that often are treated like any other.
I called it Flushino because of the ancient idiom ""Panta rhei "" that we can translate as ""Everything flows"", the word flush is used in that sense, the paper flows as the whole thing. The final part ""ino"" derives from the fact that it is a small device and in Italy we use to put ""ino"" at the end of the words for tiny objects. 
If you have to tell something to somebody use Flushino! 
Configuration
The configuration of Flushino is very simple, The first step is to teach to Flushino the name of your WiFi network, to do that we have designed a specific application that uses the bluetooth of your phone.
 
This step can be also performed via WPS button that will be added when the production chain will begin. Then you are ready to receive some messages from your friends, colleagues and so on.

Send a message
Flushino works with a telegram bot, in this way send messages is very easy !Open the Telegram application and look for Flushino bot. Start the bot and specify the address of your Flushino, it is indicated at the rear of your packaging. You have now associated your device with the Flushino bot  the work is done.

Printing Images
Flushino is also able to print images, like emoji and small images. You can print out black & white photos without wasting any ink cartridge because Flushino works with the heat!

Risks & Challenges
I've been modular during the design process, have built and tested the prototype for more than a month, have established a network of partners designing a true timeline, but there are always risks that can delay the process before Flushino gets into your hands.
Technology: The prototype worked very well, however I want to design all in one PCB  for industrialization and unexpected problems may emerge. A WPS button will also be added during the review of the hardware to make the configuration easier.
Production: So far I have produced just two prototypes that I gave to my friend to know their response, when the production chain will start, a bigger series of devices will need some small changes and some risks related to the producers.
Design: We would like to improve the package design for the future models, an idea could be make the box of wood making Flushino looks like a vintage product.
But don’t worry: I will do all the necessary to ensure that Flushino will be a high quality product when it will be shipped.

What We Need & What You Get
I put a lot of effort dealing with the suppliers to keep as low as possible the price of a single Flushino. But that's not all, the crowdfunding campaign price includes also the FCC and CE certifications to guarantee the respect of applicable laws.But, even if we do not reach the final goal, you will put your hands on Flushino anyway. Your Flushino will be right there on your desk and will work every single day to transform your messaging  experience in the biggest way.
Why you should support
I think the we can innovate our way to communicate, messages will be reality for everyone with Flushino.
Imagine the scene, you are on your sofa reading a book and suddenly you hear Flushino printing a message, so you stand up and run towards your desk to know who is texting you. Maybe is your wife that sends you a recipe for a new cake or maybe is your boss that congrats with you for the good job you did with the last deal.Using Flushino you will not waste ink as normal printers and you will reduce significantly wastes because a roll of paper can last up to a year with the average of 20 daily messages. Flushino will be the device with the lowest power consumption in your home due to its idle mode.
Thank you so much for joining the Flushino journey and helping us on our mission.
The Impact

I'm now launching Flushino through Indiegogo to establish a community of early adopters and innovators. With your support we can finalize the development of our technology, produce and ship Flushino to you and take it to the next level. My vision is to introduce new and better devices for smart home that gives the right importance to communication.
Imagine to tell your wife that you love her, with Flushino your message will be taken into account more than a simple one on a screen. The communication on your Flushino is reserved to a little élite of people that you will choose, this selection process improves the communication between fellows and make them feel closer.


Timeline
We are working hard because we would like you to find Flushino inside your Easter egg !

By using a natural evaporation technique, the water holding compartment of the humidifier can be detached completely, enabling easy washing and a safe solution to sanitation problems. As existing natural humidifier models' slow evaporation and lack of humidification presented a problem, an air circulation fan that promotes faster evaporation was attached.</p><p>Conventional humidifiers (ultrasonic, vaporizer) produce water droplets artificially, and droplets that are formed in this manner contain germs and bacteria from the water reservoir that will be released into the air. Conversely, AIR BALLOON produces water droplets naturally, and the droplets are free of germs or bacteria, replenishing moisture to our environment safely and hygienically.</p><p>AIR BALLOON is compact, stylish, and has built in LED lights that can be controlled using a remote controller. With a built in battery, it is compact and portable, and can be used in any location. The humidifier is also equipped with a hygrometer to check the humidity of the user environment.</p><p>AIR BALLOON’s fan speed can also be adjusted, and when the fan is turned off, AIR BALLOON can function as a regular evaporative type humidifier (for quiet operation - ideal for nighttime use).</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.air-balloon.com/data/editor/1705/airballoon_p1.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">  </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Germ Free &amp; Rapid Humidification </h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495159163/g9jam41bzr3nxyj3uow7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Natural humidity control by relative humidity</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495159181/pgxe7j4poxsu2wdufbaj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Maintaining the optimum humidity </strong></p><p>In contrast to an ultrasonic / vaporization type humidifier, which has the side effect of excessively increasing the humidity, the evaporative humidifier works relatively to the humidity of its setting, allowing it to maintain a natural level of humidity.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Moisture particles size comparison</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495159350/e5nugejatgstbjtoleyj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Solutions to concerns about bacterial growth and internal pollution release</strong></p><p>Conventional ultrasonic methods produce moisture particles artificially, which makes the moisture particles large (1 ~ 5㎛).

By using a natural evaporation technique, the water holding compartment of the humidifier can be detached completely, enabling easy washing and a safe solution to sanitation problems. As existing natural humidifier models' slow evaporation and lack of humidification presented a problem, an air circulation fan that promotes faster evaporation was attached.Conventional humidifiers (ultrasonic, vaporizer) produce water droplets artificially, and droplets that are formed in this manner contain germs and bacteria from the water reservoir that will be released into the air. Conversely, AIR BALLOON produces water droplets naturally, and the droplets are free of germs or bacteria, replenishing moisture to our environment safely and hygienically.AIR BALLOON is compact, stylish, and has built in LED lights that can be controlled using a remote controller. With a built in battery, it is compact and portable, and can be used in any location. The humidifier is also equipped with a hygrometer to check the humidity of the user environment.AIR BALLOON’s fan speed can also be adjusted, and when the fan is turned off, AIR BALLOON can function as a regular evaporative type humidifier (for quiet operation - ideal for nighttime use).  Germ Free & Rapid Humidification  Natural humidity control by relative humidityMaintaining the optimum humidity In contrast to an ultrasonic / vaporization type humidifier, which has the side effect of excessively increasing the humidity, the evaporative humidifier works relatively to the humidity of its setting, allowing it to maintain a natural level of humidity. Moisture particles size comparisonSolutions to concerns about bacterial growth and internal pollution releaseConventional ultrasonic methods produce moisture particles artificially, which makes the moisture particles large (1 ~ 5㎛). Internal pollutants (from the water reservoir) and air pollutants can easily bind to the moisture particles, generating the problem of contamination and release of fine dust particles into the air.On the other hand, because AIR BALLOON is an evaporative humidifier, the size of the moisture particles it generates is closer to that of those found in nature (< 0.01㎛) which is smaller than the bacteria that may form in the water reservoirs. This eliminates the problem of bacteria binding to the moisture particles. ""Consumer Reports recommends evaporative humidifiers""Consumer reports tested three types of humidifiers - evaporative, ultrasonic, and vaporizer - to see if they would release bacteria into the air. Of the 34 humidifiers tested, they found that the evaporative models produced bacteria-free water droplets. “Air - accelerated Natural Humidifier”

The felt evaporation unit absorbs water from the tank using the capillary method and evaporates it into the air. The felt used in AIR BALLOON is made of safe material that even children use as learning aids in the classroom.1. Honeycomb Type2. DIY Kit: Templates for various designs of the evaporation unit and materials HYGROMETERAIR BALLOON has a built-in hygrometer that displays visually the humidity of your environment BUILT IN FILTERAIR BALLOON provides fresh, clean air to its user by filtering the air twice before it is released. The incoming air is first screened by a filter that is installed in the air inlet of the base, and it is filtered again as it passes through the felt at the upper part of the humidifier RECHARGEABLE BATTERY & PORTABILITYEquipped with a rechargeable battery, AIR BALLOON can be used for 4 hours at full charge without needing to be connected to a power source. Easy to clean and maintainAIR BALLOON has an open water bucket structure that is detachable, so it is easy to replace the water and clean the tank. This ensures that water will not become stagnant and rot inside of the humidifier body, making the device more hygienic. MOOD LAMPAIR BALLOON is equipped with LED lights of various colors, so it can be used as a mood lamp or a night light in addition to serving as a humidifier. The LED can be turned on and off independently of the humidifier. INTERIOR ITEMUsing a hot-air balloon as a motif, AIR BALLOON has been designed to be modern and simple, providing emotional and aesthetic satisfaction in addition to benefiting the user’s health.Completed with a unique shape, color and a harmonious design of the humidifier body, AIR BALLOON has been designed to function as an art object in your indoor environment.The mood lamp function of the LED lights makes your living space even more beautiful.AROMA DIFFUSERWhen aroma oil is added to the water in the tank, wind from the circulation fan immediately evaporates the oil along with the water, filling the room with fragrance. Natural HumidifierWhen turned off, AIR BALLOON can be used as a conventional natural evaporative humidifier without noise.     The costs of tooling up for production are high, so we need to secure pre-orders before we can start production.  By pre-ordering a Air-Balloon, you are helping to make the AIR BALLOON become a reality.  Your pre-order dollars or donationpledge go towards:Injection mold productionParts productionFelt productionSafety test and performance certificationProduction and assembly We want to be certain that the humidifier we deliver lives up to your expectations.

Everyone who had newborn in their house know that you get up from three to eight times every night.

The bulbs have a lifespan of 20,000 to 50,000 hours or from 2 to 5 years of uninterrupted light.</p><p><strong>How warm does the 2cha get? </strong><br/>The warmth of 2cha lamp depends on usage (color, brightness). 2cha is substantially cooler than standard LED bulb because the LED's are farther apart from each other (to make light effects happen), so you don’t need to worry about it becoming too hot to touch. </p><p><strong>Does 2cha use more power than a traditional light bulb?</strong><br/>2cha can give a lot of light when fully lit up to 2700 lumens of light which does of course cost power. When compared to a traditional light bulb that gives the same amount of light as the 2cha, it uses 85% less power. In maximum brightness mode it uses up to 60w.</p><p><strong>Does the 2cha lamp replace my standard light in the room?</strong><br/>We didn't develop 2cha as a main source of light in the room so we do not recommend to use it as your only source of light. Although it can give enough light for small rooms.</p><p><strong>How do you integrate with home automation systems (Siri, Google Home, Alexa, etc.)?</strong><br/>2cha can seamlessly connect to any device via Bluetooth so you can choose your desired light effects through the 2cha app, and also connect 2cha to your smart device to use as speaker system.</p><p><strong>Will custom smart home system integrate with 2cha?</strong><br/>There are a lot of Intelligent Home Concept systems out there. If system is able to use Bluetooth speaker, you will be able to connect 2cha to it.</p><p><strong>What material is the outer layer made of?</strong><br/>The outer layer is made of hypoallergenic non-woven material. This kind of material is used in winter clothes to retain heat.</p><p><strong>Will it work with the power that is available in my country?</strong><br/>Yes, we use a switch mode PSU that goes from 100-240VAC / 50-60Hz. This covers most of the world, of course including EU, US, Canada, UK, and Australia.</p><p><strong>What is length of the 2cha cable?</strong><br/>120cm.</p><p><strong>Does 2cha collect dust?</strong><br/>Just like any other furniture, it can collect dust depending on the amount of dust in the room. But to make it easier to clean and maintain, we made the outer layer as pouch so you can simply take it off to clean by hand with warm water and soap. </p><p><strong>How should I clean 2cha?</strong><br/>The outer layer is detachable and can be washed with warm water. All other parts can be cleaned with microfiber and water.</p><p><strong>What is base is made off?</strong><br/>Base will be made of plastic with soft touch coating. On photos you can see base from wood (we used that in prototype). </p><p><strong>Does it make any noise? </strong><br/>Unless you play any music or sounds it won't make a sound at all. </p><p><strong>How do I switch the lamp on and off?</strong><br/>The lamp has an on/off switch just like any other lamp but you can also use the 2cha Mobile App and do it directly from your smartphone.</p><p><strong>Is it safe to install in my children's bedroom?</strong><br/>2cha is definitely safe for your child, but we can’t guarantee that kids wouldn't want to paint 2cha or decorate it with some stars. </p><h3>COMPANY</h3><p><strong>Why did you call it 2cha?</strong><br/>In Ukrainian language, where we are from, 2cha (túča) means ""clouds"". </p><p><strong>Why did it take 1 year to make 2cha? </strong><br/>Although the result might look simple its took a lot of time and effort to understand the right amount of LEDs and their positioning, and we started with just a cloud shape lamp, but now 2cha is far more than just a lamp.</p><p><strong>Why did you choose the shape of a cloud as the shade?</strong><br/>We wanted to create a pleasant dim light in any room like natural evening light that comes through some clouds in the sky - that was when we got the idea. </p><p><strong>What changes are you planning on doing to the hardware part?</strong><br/>All visual material in the campaign is done with our prototype.

  Timeline About the TeamWe run an engineering business providing services for smart home automation. In our work, we face different task concerning home automation and internet of things, and one of them is smart light solutions.The idea of 2cha came to me when my daughter was born. Everyone who had newborn in their house know that you get up from three to eight times every night. Every time person who gets up turns on the light, and it is hard to sleep when light is shining in your eyes. So I decided to create a smart lamp that can create pleasant indirect light that my daughter will also love. FAQPRODUCTDoes it come with a light bulb?Yes. 2cha comes with 156 LEDs. How long does the bulb last? The RGB LED bulbs are known for low energy consumption and for being long-lasting. The bulbs have a lifespan of 20,000 to 50,000 hours or from 2 to 5 years of uninterrupted light.How warm does the 2cha get? The warmth of 2cha lamp depends on usage (color, brightness). 2cha is substantially cooler than standard LED bulb because the LED's are farther apart from each other (to make light effects happen), so you don’t need to worry about it becoming too hot to touch. Does 2cha use more power than a traditional light bulb?2cha can give a lot of light when fully lit up to 2700 lumens of light which does of course cost power. When compared to a traditional light bulb that gives the same amount of light as the 2cha, it uses 85% less power. In maximum brightness mode it uses up to 60w.Does the 2cha lamp replace my standard light in the room?We didn't develop 2cha as a main source of light in the room so we do not recommend to use it as your only source of light. Although it can give enough light for small rooms.How do you integrate with home automation systems (Siri, Google Home, Alexa, etc.)?2cha can seamlessly connect to any device via Bluetooth so you can choose your desired light effects through the 2cha app, and also connect 2cha to your smart device to use as speaker system.Will custom smart home system integrate with 2cha?There are a lot of Intelligent Home Concept systems out there. If system is able to use Bluetooth speaker, you will be able to connect 2cha to it.What material is the outer layer made of?The outer layer is made of hypoallergenic non-woven material. This kind of material is used in winter clothes to retain heat.Will it work with the power that is available in my country?Yes, we use a switch mode PSU that goes from 100-240VAC / 50-60Hz. This covers most of the world, of course including EU, US, Canada, UK, and Australia.What is length of the 2cha cable?120cm.Does 2cha collect dust?Just like any other furniture, it can collect dust depending on the amount of dust in the room. But to make it easier to clean and maintain, we made the outer layer as pouch so you can simply take it off to clean by hand with warm water and soap. How should I clean 2cha?The outer layer is detachable and can be washed with warm water. All other parts can be cleaned with microfiber and water.What is base is made off?Base will be made of plastic with soft touch coating. On photos you can see base from wood (we used that in prototype). Does it make any noise? Unless you play any music or sounds it won't make a sound at all. How do I switch the lamp on and off?The lamp has an on/off switch just like any other lamp but you can also use the 2cha Mobile App and do it directly from your smartphone.Is it safe to install in my children's bedroom?2cha is definitely safe for your child, but we can’t guarantee that kids wouldn't want to paint 2cha or decorate it with some stars. COMPANYWhy did you call it 2cha?In Ukrainian language, where we are from, 2cha (túča) means ""clouds"". Why did it take 1 year to make 2cha? Although the result might look simple its took a lot of time and effort to understand the right amount of LEDs and their positioning, and we started with just a cloud shape lamp, but now 2cha is far more than just a lamp.Why did you choose the shape of a cloud as the shade?We wanted to create a pleasant dim light in any room like natural evening light that comes through some clouds in the sky - that was when we got the idea. What changes are you planning on doing to the hardware part?All visual material in the campaign is done with our prototype. We used some simplifying with the base (we carved base out of wood, and use external PSU). In the final product model, PSU will be inside the base and covered with protection plastic with soft touch layer.Also every 2cha will be hand made, so it can be slightly different from one to another but our sculptor Natalia will help us to reach the premium level quality we are aiming for in every piece. SHIPPINGDo you ship worldwide?Yes we ship worldwide. Select a perk and enter your shipping address to see the shipping cost for your location. Is the shipping fee included?No. The shipping fee is not included in the perks and will be applied at check out.How long will be the shipping transit time?After shipping your perk, it could take 1 to 5 weeks, depending on the location.I'm a business owner and would like to sell 2cha in my store.Contact us at 2cha.lamp@gmail.com.My question isn't listed here, what should I do?Send it to us at 2cha.lamp@gmail.com. Don't Forget to Share with Friends Thank you for check our campaign out!",20.0,5,"1 Campaign

<p>We are WHYSgiving, a dedicated and passionate team of 5, aiming to change the way businesses interact with consumers and charities alike. We wondered how much a business could influence the world if it directed significant profits toward social good rather than into the pockets of investors. We realized the answer is A LOT!</p>
<p><strong>That’s the reason we created WHYSgiving!</strong></p>
<p>In fact, it is our mission to provide meaningful consumer experiences and unlimited funding for our sponsored charities. How do we do this? Through a global consumer platform supporting charitable work around the world above all else.</p>
<p><strong>So how are we going to accomplish all this?</strong></p>
<p>Through campaigns just like this one. You are getting in on the ground floor to something revolutionizing the way the business world works (thanks for being a trailblazer). </p>
<p>It all starts with WHYSgiving creating high quality, designer-style products that are cleanly sourced, environmentally friendly and just all-round awesome. We then use eCommerce platforms like this one to provide amazing people like you with the opportunity to buy these designer products at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500505743/wq1shqkpvlzlouedf7ho.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You still with us? We hope so because this is where it gets really exciting. </p>
<p>From here, we allocate <strong>50% of our profits</strong> to carefully screened charities (more on how we screen them below, but trust us when we tell you it’s a pretty incredible system). These charities are making a positive difference on the ground, so our goal is to create a permanent and unlimited funding source for them, ensuring they always have funds to continue making the world a better place.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed by now, our first product (and cause) are designer throw blankets, in which 50% of our profits will go to help organizations that are fighting human trafficking.</p>
<p>Human trafficking is a $150 billion global industry selling both adults and children into forced labor and sex work. It is one of the ugliest things in the world today and many of us don’t realize it is happening to people all around us. It could be happening to our neighbors, friends, or even family. If you would like a little more information about the dangers of human trafficking and what you can do to help prevent it, check out our video below:</p>

<p>In order to make a positive difference, we need to raise at least $30,000 to manufacture and distribute our designer throw blankets. WHYSgiving pledges to give 50% of profits from the sale of these throw blankets to anti-trafficking charities that prevent, rescue, or rehabilitate victims of human trafficking. </p>

<p>We wanted to give everyone an opportunity to get the blankets of their choice, which is why we created several different perks for this campaign. </p>
<p>We decided to break up the perks into <strong>Early EARLY Bird, Early Bird Special</strong> and <strong>INDIEGOGO Special.</strong> The only difference between the three perk types is the cost.</p>
<p>For each perk type you have the opportunity to purchase the Criss-Cross Designer Throws (any of the 3 colors), the Large Plush Throw for Two, or a special combo package which includes 1 Criss-Cross Designer Throw and the Large Plush Throw for Two - this is a popular choice as you get the best of both worlds and save even more money!</p>
<p>The last perk is for anyone wanting to support their own cause. This perk will let you purchase 125 of our designer throw blankets (either style or color) that you can donate to a cause or charity of your choice...or you can just build an incredible blanket fort…the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that there are limited quantities for the Early EARLY Bird, Early Bird Specials and Support Your Own Cause perks.</strong></p>
<p>Buying from WHYSgiving rather than other online or luxury stores, means you’re making a difference in the world! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHYhelp? WHYcare? WHYact? - WHYnot? </strong></p>
<p>Helping us jumpstart WHYSgiving will ensure that the fight against human trafficking will be the first of many causes WHYSgiving and its consumers will stand behind! </p>

<p>Our biggest challenge is making sure that our supply chain stays clean from the moment the fabric is sourced to the moment our product hits your doorstep. We take this very seriously and employ the highest standards to ensure a clean sourcing chain.</p>

<p><strong>Why is WHYSgiving doing this?</strong></p>
<p>We recognize that charities need funding help to make a greater impact with their work. We realize that by working together, we can create much more positive change. Governments cannot fix our problems. People have to work together to make a real difference. </p>
<p>We wondered how much a business could influence the world if it directed significant profits toward social good rather than into the pockets of investors. We realized the answer is A LOT! That’s the reason we created WHYSgiving. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are the throw blankets cleanly sourced?</strong></p>
<p>We do our best to ensure that our supply chain creates our products with the highest ethical standards (no underpaid workers, no underage workers, no overworked employees), in line with the fight against human trafficking. </p>
<p>Our manufacturers have passed in-country and international supply chain standards, allowing them to not only work with us, but also with other significant businesses like a well known global entertainment franchise and a national sports league.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do I know the money is truly going to high impact charities?</strong></p>
<p>Charitable organizations and nonprofits are assessed using the WHYSgiving Impact Score (WISe). WISe analyzes each facet of every potential sponsored organization’s operations by evaluating Program Efficiency, Compliance and Reporting, Financial Responsibility, Operational Expense Profile, Fundraising Efficiency, Fiscal Health, Revenue Profile, Net Assets and Institutional Endowment, and Self-Sufficiency. <br/><br/>50% of WHYSgiving’s profits are disbursed quarterly to sustain our sponsored organizations‘ work. We also routinely monitor our sponsored organizations‘ operations to ensure they can remain qualified under the WISe standard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will there be other products?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We plan to periodically add products to support the end of human trafficking, and other charitable causes. </p>

Are you feeling as passionate as we are about ending human trafficking? Getting the word out and sharing this INDIEGOGO campaign on your social networks would be a huge step in the right direction.
We would be forever grateful for any support you can provide as we work towards ending human trafficking whilst pioneering a better business model. Thank you for all of your help!

Why is WHYSgiving doing this?
We recognize that charities need funding help to make a greater impact with their work. We realize that by working together, we can create much more positive change. Governments cannot fix our problems. People have to work together to make a real difference. 
We wondered how much a business could influence the world if it directed significant profits toward social good rather than into the pockets of investors. We realized the answer is A LOT! That’s the reason we created WHYSgiving. 
 
Are the throw blankets cleanly sourced?
We do our best to ensure that our supply chain creates our products with the highest ethical standards (no underpaid workers, no underage workers, no overworked employees), in line with the fight against human trafficking. 
Our manufacturers have passed in-country and international supply chain standards, allowing them to not only work with us, but also with other significant businesses like a well known global entertainment franchise and a national sports league.
 
How do I know the money is truly going to high impact charities?
Charitable organizations and nonprofits are assessed using the WHYSgiving Impact Score (WISe). WISe analyzes each facet of every potential sponsored organization’s operations by evaluating Program Efficiency, Compliance and Reporting, Financial Responsibility, Operational Expense Profile, Fundraising Efficiency, Fiscal Health, Revenue Profile, Net Assets and Institutional Endowment, and Self-Sufficiency. 50% of WHYSgiving’s profits are disbursed quarterly to sustain our sponsored organizations‘ work. We also routinely monitor our sponsored organizations‘ operations to ensure they can remain qualified under the WISe standard.
 
Will there be other products?
Yes.
We plan to periodically add products to support the end of human trafficking, and other charitable causes.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>My fish, my <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vegetables</a> and I</h2>
<p>  Hi, my name is João Pedro Pimenta and I'm an 18-year-old Portuguese that loves everything the world has to offer. In 2017 I was admited to medical school, but decided to leave after two months to follow some of my deeper passions: I want to become a writter, so I ended my first book and I'm starting the second of many who are to come (unfurtunatly, it's not published yet); I dream of being a flamenco guitar player, therefour, I'm compousing my inicial pieces and, the most important part of this campaing is that I have the urge to create a brand that incorporates what I thing a company should be. I want to build products that solve some of the world's problems by giving power to the people, never doing that at the expense of the environment or other human beings and helping, with the profits, to develop the arts, the sciences, the world and those in need. As a vegetarian, I really like to think about what I put in my mouth. «You are what you eat», we all know that, but to many times we end up filling our bodies with unwanted chemicals that are just there for things to grow larger and faster, not being able to do anything because we lack the soil to plant on. «What if I could have a garden in my apartment that gave me all I need without it being ugly and filling up to much space?», this is what I thought when I came up with this idea, and, as I learn more and more about the topic, I'm starting to believe even further in this technology.</p>
<p>  This project, for me, is more than just a dream: is a neurosis, something I cannot not do. I think about this every day, always trying to put myself in your shoes, the public, to see what can be done to achieve the point in which this is not just something you buy but is an investment that will return your money in the long run, and that will bust your health and help to develop what is important in every step of the way, through donations we'll be making to institutions we consider to be relevant. Isn't this what a product should be all about?</p>
<p>  Your funding is fundamental for all of this to happen.</p>
<h2>It pays itself!</h2>
<p>  By using this aquaponic system has the main source of fruit and vegetables, the average American should be able to pay for the system in, roughly, four to five years, but some might even lower that number!</p>
<h2>Our goal is sustainability!</h2>
<p>  We look for the mother earth in every step of the road, and that's why we will reduce transportations by constructing the systems in your hometown, while lowering the price that you pay for it, and we try to use materials with a low impact in the environment.</p>

<p>  <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aquaponics</a> gives you the opportunity to grow your own food in a system that has almost no maintenance what so ever and that saves almost all the water in it while saving you money in groceries that will, over time, pay for all the costs of the system. Here are some of the benefits of our system:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511520993/jvshnocgmwxlihoqho9n.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>  Also, we reduce the consumption of electricity with the use of a single pump and the use of physics to move the water in all the other places, and design the system in a way that it can retain the water in the case of that same pump breaking down. Like that is not enougth, we desing the system to have a sponge before the water goes to the tank again and we made it super easy to remove and put it again, and we have wells because filled with water, this system gets quite heavy, but we don't want you to be taking all the water if you ever decide you want to move it to another place, just pug it out and it's ready to go! With our system you will not only have something to talk about, you will also have the food we promise due to our area of growth, that is bigger than any other system designed specifically for houses.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><strong>I set my goal in 5,000 euros to pay for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Indiegogo and bank fees - cost 500 euros;</li>
<li>Creating the company - cost 360 euros;</li>
<li>Printed publicity that I personally will distribute throughout, firstly, the big cities of <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Portugal</a> (like Porto and Lisbon), and, in the near future, in other countries, organizing demonstrations that will be done in that places, and publicity on the internet - cost 640 euros;</li>
<li>Launch a website for online sells -cost 300 euros;</li>
<li>Ask for a patent for the logo we have designed -260 euros;</li>
<li>Pay a thank you pizza to my friend José and my girlfriend Florinda who both helped me take this project of the ground - cost 30 euros;</li>
<li>Have some capital to produce the first models to help to better grow the company - cost 2000 euros.</li>
<li>Other expenses that will come in the way - cost 1000 euros.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And what if we don't get the full amount? </strong>We have your priorities well defined to ensure that, even if we don't get the money we hope, be can still start the company and grow our brand, even though it would be a slower process.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Here are our perks for you:</u></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>T-shirt with our logo: </strong>Help us to take this idea to every home and take a peace of us with you everywhere you go. The logo can't be shown here because of the lack of patent to protect it, but believe us that it is gorgeous.</li>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>  The creation of this company will have a much bigger impact in the world than just the products that will be sold. For starters, this will be a revolutionary good because it will actually provide a good amount of food and not only be capable of maintaining a couple of plants, reducing all the problems of <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">agriculture</a> and bringing more natural and <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">health</a>ier food to the table. But, more than that, has said previously, this will be a firm that will have an active role in the global community and its problems, and the donations to other organizations are just the start of what's to come. We will be involved with artists, scientists and the people all around the globe. We want to make this more than just a way to make a living, because I'll put my name on this, and I want to be able to look myself in the mirror every morning knowing that I put every drop of who I am in everything I do.</p>
<p>  Our products will also diversify from the <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">agriculture</a> branch, and we will create a team to develop some other ideas we've got, and also new things and new ways of solving some of the world's problems by giving power to the people.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>  The biggest problem in building such a thing is that, because the tank is made of glass, the final product is quite heavy and not good for transportations, and that is why we talk so much about making it in your home country: we want reduce our carbon footprint and the costs in transportations by building your system as near of you as possible. That means that we need to have manufactured all around the globe, what will certainly not be an easy task. But is one that can be done, mainly in this super-connected world we have today with instant communication. I'm not a person of not ending what I start and, for those who contribute, I guarantee you that you'll receive you product has advertised, even if I have to work at McDonald's to be able to pay for the thing from my own pocket.</p>
<p>  I might be young, but I have heard the advice from those who did it, and I have done my research and I'm ready for what I'm not ready for what's to come. This is an idea with potential, and I'm up to challenge and ready, if bad fortune hits me, to fail and rise again.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>  Don't just go away if you think that this is too expensive for you or if this is not what you want because there are a lot of ways you can help me in this battle. Do some noise about this, talk to your friends and strangers about this campaign, and don't forget to use the share tools of indigogo. Leave your mark on me and I will incubate it and project it to the world. Thank you!</p>

Our commitment to sustainabilityGROW! will be manufactured according to strict ecological and socially-responsible production methods. 100% manufactured in Germany.Aim for a healthier homeMost of the furniture you buy these days is designed to fall apart. Depending on its quality, some furniture does stick around for a while, but a large amount of it is built cheaply to be landfilled after just a couple of years of use.The most toxic thing in your house is …probably your furniture. Furniture is usually made from pressed wood like plywood, MDF, particleboard, or fibreboard. What you probably don't know, is that pressed wood contains high levels of formaldehyde; a highly toxic substance which evaporates over years and causes cancer.  For more info visit The National Cancer Institute and the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA.The bad news end here and the good news start with GROW!  Deutsche Version

Display für auszustellende Waren und Güter

Sitzgelegenheit für Deine Besucher

Bar, Thresen oder Stehtisch (die Höhe bestimmst Du)
  Einfacher AufbauEs könnte wirklich nicht einfacher sein. Die Verbinder („connectors“) werden einfach in die in die Hauptmodule gesteckt. Mit einfachen U-Clips werden die Regale in der Höhe gesichert.Es wird kein Werkzeug oder Fachwissen benötigt.  Hänge es an die WandSchwebende Regale: die Wandbefestigung bleiben unsichtbar und das Regal scheint zu schweben.Du kannst die Module (einfache Tiefe)* an die Wand hängen. Dafür liefern wir Dir Befestigungssets mit. Wenn Du GROW! an die Wand befestigst, musst Du die mitgelieferten Schrauben in die GROW! Module hineindrehen. Keine Sorge, Du benötigst sehr wenig Kraft dafür. Jedes Kind kann das mit Leichtigkeit!* (doppelte Tiefe oder mehr) können nicht an die Wand befestigt werden und sind nur freistehend anwendbar.  Die organisch, gewölbte Form von GROW! erlaubt Dir auch Kabel an der Rückwand problemlos nachträglich zu führen oder zu wechseln (Bild unten).              
 
GROW! besteht aus 3 Komponenten:  Maße      FarbenGROW! gibt es in Schwarz und Weiß. Du kannst die Farben der Komponenten mischen (wenn Du willst).  OberflächeGROW! hat eine fein gezeichnete, texturierte Oberfläche.  PflegeleichtGROW! ist ist wasserabweisend, resistent gegen Chemikalien und einfach zu reinigen.

Lasst es uns so erklären: das sind 95% Luft und 5% Tupperware (PP). Das Material ist stark und robust, gleichzeitig aber sehr leicht. Deshalb kannst Du Dein GROW! jederzeit mit Leichtigkeit neu arrangieren. Jedes Hauptmodul wiegt nur etwa 300g.​  Stabil & sicherDu kannst GROW! nur schwer beschädigen. Es hat nämlich stoßdämpfende Eigenschaften. Du brauchst Dir auch keine Sorgen zu machen wegen Verletzungen oder dass Du Deinen Boden beschädigen könntest. Es ist so auch absolut sicher für Kinder.  100% nachhaltigFür uns ist das nicht nur ein Wort. GROW! ist zu 100% recyclebar. Dazu kommt noch, das es auf 95% Luft besteht und tatsächlich nur 5% Material!GROW! ist schadstofffrei, emissionsfrei, hypoallergen (Allergiker freundlich), stoßfest (hervorragende Energieabsorption), extrem leichtgewichtig und daher sehr einfach zu handhaben.

GROW! wird zu 100% in Deutschland hergestellt.Wir streben nach einem gesünderen zu HauseDie meisten Möbel, die Du heutzutage kaufen kannst werden produziert um wieder auseinander zu fallen. Je nach Qualität, halten auch manche Möbel ein bisschen länger durch. Der größte Teil davon ist aber billig produziert und verschmutzt nach kurzem Gebrauch unsere Umwelt.Das giftigste in Deinem Haus…ist möglicherweise eines Deiner Möbel. Diese sind normalerweise aus gepresstem Sperrholz, MDF, beschichtetes Sperrholz oder Faserplatte gefertigt. Was Du vielleicht bisher nicht wusstest ist, dass dieses Material Formaldehyd enthält. Die Substanz ist hoch toxisch und dünstet über Jahre hinweg in Deinem zu Hause aus. Formaldehyd steht im Verdacht bei Menschen Krebserregend zu sein (bei Ratten wurde dies übrigens unzweifelhaft nachgewiesen).Mehr Informationen findest Du unter:http://www.schadstoffberatung.de/formalde.htmhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FormaldehydThe National Cancer Institute und der US Umweltschutzbehörde EPA.Die schlechten Nachrichten enden hier und die GUTEN beginnen mit GROW!",151.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Why We're Here</h3>
<p>When our son was born, we decided to take steps to lead healthier, cleaner, and greener lives, without it changing who we are at heart, the homeys next door. It was all about putting more thought into what we put in, on, and around our bodies, and in our home. The first step was eliminating the harmful chemicals and toxins found in everyday products that are slowly damaging our bodies. Instead, we sought brands and companies with values like ours. We continue to discover new products all the time, but we have gotten lucky and found a few products that we will continue to buy for the rest of our lives. We want to introduce our customers, to products that could work out the same for them.<br/><br/>We truly believe that how we treat our bodies and others is one of the most important factors we can control in our lives and we want our homeys to be around for as long as possible. <br/><br/>Launching The Homey Hippies and owning a family business is our dream, and to be doing something we are both passionate about, while having the opportunity to help others is only going to make this ride even better. Your support means the world to us and will help us achieve something we’ve wanted, talked about, and daydreamed about for so long.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481528075/g6dgdkfwtgw2sn0ljygy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/> </p>

<h3>I don't want to be a bad husband</h3>
<p>I can be sometimes without meaning to.  I am Dad with a wife married over 10 years, 3 kids (2 that are twins) and a dog that is only 10 months old.  Like everyone, my wife and I struggle with chores to maintain the household.  I admit I can be forgetful, absent-minded, and easily distracted.  So when I don't do the dishes or take out the trash it's not because I don't want to do it, I got distracted with work, the dog, kids, etc....</p>
<p>My wife, the MOM does not want to have to remind me nor do I want her to remind me or the kids. It tires her out because she feels that she has the weight of the household on her and it occupies a huge amount of space of her brain.</p>
<p>Mom is the BOSS of the household.  She needs help, more importantly, something that will be easy to set up and will help her run the house.</p>
<p>The campaign is to develop an app to help Dads, Moms, and Families.  This App is called Mom Boss.  Mom Boss will automatically configure the chores for the household after answering a few questions. </p>
<p>There will be two sides to the App, Mom and everyone else. </p>
<p><u><strong>Mom Side:</strong></u></p>
<p>Mom is the BOSS.  Once she answers the questions she can then she can swipe left (the chore is hers) or swipe right (the chore is someone else's).  She can adjust times for reminders or snooze if the chore is not required that day.</p>
<p><u><strong>The rest of the Family</strong></u></p>
<p>The rest of the family will receive the schedule from the Mom side.  They cannot swipe left or right to change the chore schedule.   The once the task is due but not yet completed there will be vocal reminders.  Changing accordingly, the first will be a sweet voice requesting that the chore be done.  Next, it will be a more insistent voice to remind them that it has been more than 15 minutes since it was first asked. After a half-hour, a vocal ""kick in the pants"" where a very LOUD and very ANGRY sounding voice will remind the family member to do the chore.  The voice will be adjusted if it is kids with a tablet or phone, the last voice will be a cartoon character crying or saying ""oh no, we're not done yet!"".  If your kids don't have a tablet or smartphone but if you have a smart home, it will turn off Netflix until the chore is done.</p>
<p>Once a chore is done the rest of the family will hit the acknowledge button, but the MOM has to verify if it was done correctly before the reminders are reset.</p>
<p>The focus of this app is to make sure that the rest of the Family can help MOM and give us a kick in the pants when we need it.</p>
<p><u><strong>Budget</strong></u></p>
<p>My estimate is that we need $20,000 to get this app developed and in both the Apple App Store and Google Play.  We need a cross-functional platform because sometimes we have multi-system households. </p>
<p>The estimate for the base App cost is $10,000 for Android and $5,000 for the iOS side. Estimate $5,000 to get the professional voice work to load into the app.</p>
<p>The first version of the app will be in English.  If we get more funding, we plan to expand it to French, Spanish, and Mandarin.  We are open to new languages if there is enough interest.</p>
<p>Mom's work so hard for their families, they are responsible for so much that we can't thank them enough but we can make their lives easier.  This app at its core helps Mom the Boss run the household so that Mom can spend her time do things for herself.</p>
<p>I have been a program/project manager for over 10 years, the same length of me being married.  I have been known to find creative solutions from projects that range from $10,000 to $4 million dollars.  We will make sure this app will launch on time and on budget.   We have reviewed the concept and what we need to make this app successful.  We already have had developers review the concept and reviewed their previous projects to ensure that they are up to the task.  We have been in contact with voice-actors to give our App the extra voices it needs to make it effective.</p>

<p>After close to 3 years of research and development, we are excited to launch the Fenix Pan, the world's lightest cast iron frying pan. The Fenix Pan is a revolutionary cast iron pan developed by master metal craftspeople in Japan, a country famous for metal processing.</p>
<p>This 10 inch cast iron pan weighs just over 2 pounds, is very easy to handle and very durable. In fact, because of the incredible thinness of the Fenix Pan (1.5 mm), it can heat up to 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) in about half the time of other cast iron pans. And yet, the Fenix Pan retains heat just as well as heavier cast iron pans weighing three times more.<br/> </p>

<p><br/><strong>Is the Fenix Pan non-stick?</strong></p>
<p>The Fenix Pan is finished with a safe, food grade eco-friendly coating, to prevent rusting. While this coating is not inherently non-stick, the ultra fine texture of the pan makes it behave like a non-stick or seasoned pan.<br/><br/><strong>Is there a lid available for the Fenix Pan?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently testing a glass top lid to use with the Fenix Pan. Once we are happy with its long term performance, we will let our backers know how to order one.</p>
<p><strong>What cooking surfaces work with the Fenix Pan?</strong></p>
<p>The Fenix Pan is designed to work with all cooktops: electric, gas, induction, glass top, open flame, ovens, barbeques, etc. The Fenix Pan also comes with a removable silicon handle end cap which is heat resistant up to 250℃ (482°F).</p>
<p><strong>Where will my Fenix Pan be shipped from?</strong></p>
<p>Since our manufacturing facility is located in Japan, all orders will be shipped from our central shipping hub in Japan using Fedex.</p>
<p><strong>When can I expect delivery of my Fenix Pan?</strong></p>
<p>This will depend on which perk reward you selected. Every perk has a corresponding estimated delivery date.</p>

<h3><font size=""5""><font size=""5"">Risks &amp; Challenges</font></font></h3>
<p>Manufacturing the Fenix Pan, requires precise specifications and robust system processes. We have dedicated close to 3 years of research, development and testing in preparation for full scale production.</p>
<p>As we begin ramping up towards full scale production, we will be ensuring that the Fenix Pan maintains the highest standards in terms of fit, finish and overall quality associated with a Made in Japan product,</p>
<p>Timing is a potential risk with all manufacturing projects and something we take very seriously. That is one reason why we have waited until now to introduce the Fenix Pan to you.  With our full scale production systems now in place, we are confident in our ability to meet our conservative delivery estimates, and we promise complete transparency on any unforeseen issues.</p>

The secret to our lightweight pan is a combination of a specialized type of cast iron material, and a proprietary casting process that results in a durable frying pan that is as thin as a penny (1.5 mm) and weighs just over 2 pounds (1 kg)
 


 


Superior Heat Transfer
The key to cooking delicious dishes is the speed and consistency of heat conduction. The Fenix Pan not only provides excellent heat retention and consistency across the bottom of the pan, but also on the sides as well. This helps ensure ingredients cook evenly. And because the Fenix Pan is made of cast iron, you can enjoy full-flavored dishes, made on your stove top or in your oven.

 

Unique Cooking Surface
The ultra fine texture of the Fenix Pan's cooking surface, reduces the number of contact points with food ingredients, which lowers the chance of scorching and sticking. Plus, this cooking surface allows fat from meats and moisture from vegetables to fill these tiny crevices, which imparts a special finish to your dishes.


 


Compact Design
With an ergonomic handle, the Fenix Pan is perfectly suited for stovetop and oven use. While it is compact, this pan is much deeper than a typical frying pan, so it can hold a large volume of ingredients.  Plus, the flared upper edge allows for easy transferring of food to your plate.

How It's MadeManufacturing of the Fenix Pan begins with a proprietary precision sand cast mold that allows molten iron to be cast at a thickness of only 1.5 mm on the side walls and just 2 mm thick on the bottom. This proprietary process has taken us close to 3 years of development to perfect. After casting, each Fenix Pan is thoroughly hand checked for quality and consistency, to ensure you receive the highest quality product that lives up to the Made in Japan name.A precision sand cast mold is created to make the Fenix Pan casting Fenix Pan cast molds are stacked together in preparation for pouring molten iron Special molten iron heated to 1200℃ is prepared to create Fenix Pans Molten iron is poured into stack of Fenix Pan castings. Precision temperature control allows us to create a 1.5 mm thick, ultra lightweight frying pan After Fenix Pans have finished cooling, each pan is thoroughly hand checked, prepped andcleaned to ensure the highest, most-consistent qualityHow a 500 Year Old Iron Pot Discovered In Japan Led To Inventing The Fenix PanThe town of Sanjo city (Japan) has a long history of craftsmanship.  Already in the Muromachi Period (1336 - 1537 AD),  some 500 years ago, Sanjo possessed casting technology so advanced that it could make extremely thin cast iron pots that would be hard to reproduce even today.In 2002, several everyday items and a mold for a cast iron pot, were unearthed in the Shimocho Ruins located in Sanjo. This discovery highlighted the existence of a group of craftsmen known as the Osaki Cast Iron Craftsmen, or Osaki Casters, who were active in Sanjo during the Muromachi Period.The historic iron pot seen above, excavated from the Fujinoki Ruins, is thought to have been made by the Osaki Casters with the very mold discovered in the Shimocho Ruins in Sanjo. Amazingly, this pot is only 3 mm thick! Even today, it would difficult to produce a pot as thin and fine as this iron pot made by a group of Sanjo craftsmen some 500 years ago.Yet to surpass even this degree of thinness, was the goal for a new kind of cast iron frying pan, the Fenix Pan.Why Lightweight Cast Iron Cookware Is Very Difficult To Make
In casting, a form is created by pouring hot, molten metal into the empty space of a mold. The molten metal starts to harden the instant it touches the mold. The challenge is that the more constricted the space within the mold, the more likely it is that the molten iron will harden and set, before the object is fully formed - resulting in very brittle iron that would easily crack.It is for this reason, that cast iron objects are typically cast as thick, heavy objects to overcome this challenge. But thinness was our objective, because a lighter object is more practical and easier to use.By targeting a thinness of only 1.5 mm, we would improve on the achievements of the Sanjo craftsmen some 500 years ago.

How We Solved These ChallengesUsing key knowledge passed down over many generations,  we began development of the Fenix Pan. We started by using a special type of iron called ductile cast iron, which when cast, produces extremely strong, top-grade cast iron products.The carbon in this iron alloy is specially manipulated into spherical nodules to prevent structural cracks. The final material is hard yet ductile, meaning that it can deform under tensile stress - perfect attributes for casting the Fenix Pan.Development of Proprietary Sand Cast Mold Drawing upon our extensive experience manufacturing industrial-grade cast iron products, we dedicated close to 3 years of research, development, prototyping and testing to finally create an innovative sand cast mold, capable of casting molten ductile iron as thin as 1.5 mm. The result of this 3-year journey has led to creating the lightest cast iron pan in the world -  a pan we believe to be worthy of the achievements of the Osaki Casters from 500 years ago.   Testing Reveals Fenix Pan Heats Up 50% Faster Than Regular Cast IronBecause the Fenix Pan is amazingly thin and lightweight, it is able to heat up incredibly fast. In fact, it can heat up to 100℃ (212°F) in about half the time of regular cast iron cookware. Plus, the Fenix Pan retains heat just as well as heavier cast iron pans weighing double and even triple the weight.  
Test 1: Temperature Rise to 100 Degrees Celsius  (Bottom)    Our first test measured how quickly the Fenix Pan can heat up to 100℃ (212°F) compared to other popular cast iron pans.Each pan was heated on a gas stove and the main cooking surface temp. was measured. As the graph illustrates, the Fenix Pan is able to heat up 50% faster than other cast iron pans!The reason behind this difference, is that the Fenix Pan is made of ultra lightweight cast iron construction, and therefore has less mass to heat up. This makes the Fenix Pan highly energy efficient and provides more precise pan temperature control. 
Test 2: Temperature Rise to 100 Degrees Celsius (Sides)   The second test we conducted was to see how well the sides of the Fenix Pan heat up in the same time-frame as test #1.You can clearly see once again, that the Fenix Pan is able to heat up roughly 50% faster than other cast iron cookware. This enables excellent heating consistency throughout the cooking surface of the Fenix Pan.  
 
Test 3: Heat Retention Rate  (Bottom)
 
 
Our final test measured how well the Fenix Pan retains heat compared to heavier cast iron pans.
This test involved heating each piece of cookware to 100℃ (212°F), then turning off the heat source to measure the rate of heat loss over time.A key benefit of cast iron is that, as a cookware material, it is able to absorb and retain heat for a considerable period of time. This ensures consistent heating and therefore even cooking of ingredients. Amazingly, even thought the 10 inch Fenix Pan weighs just over 2 lbs (compared to other pans weighing 4-5+ lbs), it is able to retain heat in a similar way. These tests demonstrate that the Fenix Pan not only heats up faster than regular cast iron cookware, but it also incorporates all of the best characteristics of traditional cast iron cooking: consistent heating, great heat retention, stove and oven dual use, etc. without the added weight.
