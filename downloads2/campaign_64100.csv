<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I was diagnosed with <strong>Severe Crohn's Disease in April of 2012</strong> after suffering with what was thought to be food poisoning. After those tests came back negative, for the third time, I really began to worry. <strong>I went from a healthy 150 pound guy who exercised regularly to a mere 103 pound guy who could barely make it from the bed to the couch. I lost all fat and muscle and found daily tasks extremely difficult. I found myself letting the days pass by. </strong><strong>I failed my spring quarter classes and lost my financial aid due to this disease.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For my 5 stays in the hospital and my treatments I accumulated over <strong>$68,000 in medical debt.</strong> Most of this debt was taken care of through charity but I still owe over $5,000 and even with a job it is very difficult to make any progress toward getting this debt eliminated when I have rent and other bills to pay.<strong> I had to stop my treatments because</strong> <strong>I could no longer afford to pay for them.</strong> I was terminated from state medical assitance, after 5 months because I made over the $299 per month maximum they have set. My main goal is to get started back on the treatments I was on so that I may remain a healthy person.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Crohn's put a stop on my life, school and work. Even with a job, it barely allows me to cover bills such as rent and eletricity, let alone past medical bills and current medications. I was without health insurance and my hospital bills are enough to make anyone want to climb under a rock. Last year let me know that everyone should prepare for the worst and unexpected.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
</div>
<ul>
<li>I need help paying for my treatments. It costs around upwards of $3000 a treatment every 6-8 weeks. With the amount donated I will be able to start up on my treatments again and hopefully remain on them this time.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any donation amount is greatly appreciated.</strong></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I need help getting back on my feet, restarting these treatments will keep my body healty allowing me to remain in school and work more, where I will be able to put more money into the costs of my Crohn's medications.</li>
</ul><div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many people do not know the pains people with Crohn's Disease face as many sufferes appear to be normal healthy people.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Any money raised can help me continue my treatments and prevent my body from harming itself so that I may remain in school and work. Every day is a fear that I may have a flare up and end up hospitalized again.</li>

<h3><br/></h3>I became a nurse so I could help people in real and tangible ways.

We come from varied backgrounds, including medicine and technology, and different levels of experience in international medical missions. Inspired by the unmet medical needs of people in certain regions of the world, we have been working for over a year and a half to develop a medical records system capable of acquiring essential medical information in the high-volume, fast-paced environment of a short term clinic. Our focus is on the needs within Haiti, but we hope that our system will be useful to such teams around the world; in other underdeveloped countries as well as underserved regions of developed countries. Our project is associated with Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan, USA.</p><p>There are thousands of NGO's that
travel to Haiti each year, many of them medically focused. These teams often stay
in Haiti very briefly, at times treating thousands of patients in
under a week. Doctor-patient interaction is frequently limited to only 10
minutes to accommodate such high volumes. While these groups are
well-intentioned and offer momentary relief, the
insufficient<span>  communication between them results in a lack of continuity in health care. Since each group has no
access to the previous records of their patient population, and
therefore no data to use in preparation of their trip, the medications they
bring and the care they provide is mostly based on guess work. Furthermore,
the lack of data collection overlooks the
opportunity to study the effectiveness of temporary international medical
relief teams. Our aim is to collect and store patient information effectively and collect the information in such a way that does not impede the work of such high-volume, fast-paced transient medical clinics.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>*****************</p><p>The software, known as fEMR (pronounced like 'femur'), has been piloted once already under that name 'EasyEMR'. We have more work to do, but it is quite functional and ready for used in the field. Our system is running on old, donated laptops and netbooks. This hardware is inadequate.</p><p>Our newest version of the system is meant to run on a laptop computer transmitting an 'ad hoc', local wireless network connected to a slew of iPads at stations in the clinic.

We come from varied backgrounds, including medicine and technology, and different levels of experience in international medical missions. Inspired by the unmet medical needs of people in certain regions of the world, we have been working for over a year and a half to develop a medical records system capable of acquiring essential medical information in the high-volume, fast-paced environment of a short term clinic. Our focus is on the needs within Haiti, but we hope that our system will be useful to such teams around the world; in other underdeveloped countries as well as underserved regions of developed countries. Our project is associated with Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan, USA.There are thousands of NGO's that
travel to Haiti each year, many of them medically focused. These teams often stay
in Haiti very briefly, at times treating thousands of patients in
under a week. Doctor-patient interaction is frequently limited to only 10
minutes to accommodate such high volumes. While these groups are
well-intentioned and offer momentary relief, the
insufficient  communication between them results in a lack of continuity in health care. Since each group has no
access to the previous records of their patient population, and
therefore no data to use in preparation of their trip, the medications they
bring and the care they provide is mostly based on guess work. Furthermore,
the lack of data collection overlooks the
opportunity to study the effectiveness of temporary international medical
relief teams. Our aim is to collect and store patient information effectively and collect the information in such a way that does not impede the work of such high-volume, fast-paced transient medical clinics.What We Need & What You Get*****************The software, known as fEMR (pronounced like 'femur'), has been piloted once already under that name 'EasyEMR'. We have more work to do, but it is quite functional and ready for used in the field. Our system is running on old, donated laptops and netbooks. This hardware is inadequate.Our newest version of the system is meant to run on a laptop computer transmitting an 'ad hoc', local wireless network connected to a slew of iPads at stations in the clinic. We require funding to obtain the iPads with accessories such as keyboard attachments as well as hardware to amplify the signal transmitted from the master computer. Additionally, we require funding for a stipend to cover the personal costs of a programmer knowledgeable of the system who will be on standby for tech support whenever the system is in the field as well as to aid in further software development.We are aiming for a total of $6000 to meet these goals. Here is the breakdown of where the money will go:$2,346 to cover the cost of 6 iPads$504 to cover the cost of Insurance for these iPads$726 to cover the cost of protective covers for the iPads$240 to cover the cost of attachable keypads for the iPads$240 to cover the cost of 6 solar powered chargers$444 to cover the cost of additional accessories such as laptop battery support and hardware to enhance signal tranmission range$1500 to cover the cost of IT support for 1 year from a recent Computer Science graduate from Wayne State University who is knowledgeable about the systemRewards for all donors of any level will include recognition on the wallpaper of all system screens; bolded with a minimum $30 donation.

When she was born I had to have an emergency C - Section. Not even two weeks later I got an infection in my incision and went to stay with family up in Spokane. There I was feeling really sick and when I went to the hospital they told me that I had to have my gallbladder removed. As of this point I was on maternity leave at my job and they wanted to promote me to full time bookkeeper, unfortunately I was unable to take the position and return to work at that time. My surgery was set for the following Monday, but that Friday I went into the ER and was admitted into the hospital for Gallstone Pancreatitis. Since then I've been in and out of the hospitals, seeing both a primary care doctor and specialist. I've been seen at the ER so many times that I'm pretty sure I'm a regular now. About 6 months ago they finally found something. I have what is known as C-Diff which is a toxin in my intestines that has been slowing taking over. I have been through 3 different antibiotics and still have this disease. There is only one more possible option for hope before this disease kills me and that is a transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. So if you are still reading this and interested in helping me any donation would help. I have to pay 5,000 up front just to so they will see me. I've been on medicaid and collecting welfare for this last year do to being sick and not being able to work. Medicaid will not pay outside the state of Washington, so everything must come out of pocket. I'm 24 years old with a one year old. I am not the type of person to ask for help, but I'm also not the type to give up without a fight. My daughter deserves the world and I'm fighting to live so I can give it to her.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Chase. I am 26 years old, from Hollister, NC. I am the father of two beautiful children, Chase Jr. and Isabella, who are living separately with their mother. My girlfriend, Darla is amazing, and I consider her 2 children my own. We call live outside of Henderson, NC in the country. We also have 2 dogs: Max and Raven, who also help me out on a regular basis. Our goal is $15,000 for medical expenses and disease related costs. Here is my journey up until today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2006 I began having multiple boils and cysts on my scalp. Over time, these abcesses began tracting forward from the top of my neck on up to the front of my hairline. Several specialists, antibiotics, and surgeries later, I was referred to Duke Dermatology for an assessment.</p>
<p>Near the end of 2010, I was diagnosed with Hidradenitis Suppurativa(H.S) and Dissecting Cellulitis of the Scalp, both advanced. By this point, the disease had been pretty much unchallenged in my body, and the effects were irreversable. Hidradenitis now affects almost 25% of my lower body and Dissecting Cellulitis has taken over my scalp. Hidradenitis is incurable, not usually life threatening, but can be debilitating. The areas of my body affected are the worst, the buttocks and the groin areas. No conventional or practical treatments have worked, including intralesional steroid injections, high dose quinolones(Levaquin), excision and packing, or long term antibiotic courses. The diseases are so far advanced, that my dermatologist and myself made the decision to go forth with the most radical, yet most successful method of treatment.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2012, I stepped into the Duke Cancer Center for my first round of external beam radiation. I know, you're probably thinking I have some form of cancer. Nope, but at times I wish, cancer is a lot simpler to explain, although it is a much worse diagnosis, and I do not wish to take anything away from a cancer patients fight and struggle. My first day of a two week process went pretty well, nothing too painful or scary. Fast foward to week 2, day 8/11. By this time the radiation had began to build in my body, and even at such a low dose, it has taken its toll on me. My skin is becoming irritated, the lesions in my buttock region have become inflamed and swollen to the point that it hurts to sit, stand walk or lay down. The techs were always so nice, and caring. But to walk out or the room and see a 14 year old kid receiving chemo, I just wanted to apologize for wasting everones time. There was a man that walked into the cancer center the same day as me. This man was about the same height as me(6'4-6'5 or so) but in much better shape, with his wife and daughter, both beautiful and smiling. I saw this same man on the last day of my first round, in a wheel chair, covered with a blanket, and so weak from weeks of chemotherapy that he could barely hold his head up. That scared me for this very reason: one major but rare complication of H.S. is cancer and the fact that I subjected myself to radiation and the disease has progressed as far as it has increases my chances. I am terrified of winding up in that wheelchair, too weak from chemotherapy to walk myself to my car.</p>
<p>Today, September 2, 2012, I have noticed some progress stemming from radiation. Some smaller sites are beginning to shrink or have already disappeared; well, not disappear, but reduced to scar tissue. Now, I am able to stand for a longer period of time, can complete my work shift without taking excessive standing or walking breaks. And, I can now do some activities with my children. Last week, I took Chase Jr, Isabella, and Darla's daughter, Aliya for a ride on the lawn mowers dump cart. While I was in pain, it was minimal with the help of medication, I was able to do something other than lay down. Depression isn't so much of an issue any more. I was in a bad funk, thinking that God hated me, and I was doing something wrong to be punished with suffering. Now, I am kind of seeing a different light. Darla, oh boy, Darla has been amazing. Putting up with the pain, the sleepless nights, lack of help around the house, helping out with wound care and remembering to take medications. I honestly dont know what I would do if she weren't around. I still see the worry in her eyes, but its not as bad, almost like she sees the light at the end of the tunnel like me. In the words of my father ""She's my saving grace"". Couldn't have been more right dad. Most women would have been done when intimacy became a problem. There were times when she couldn't even hug me tight for fear of putting pressure on a painful abcess or worse causing one to burst under the skin. But she's been here, right here the whole time. And I dont see her going anywhere. I know you are probably tired of reading, so i'll get to the point.</p>
<p><br/>Now, for the reason that I need donations. My medical bills are piling up, and I have to go back in 2.5 weeks to discuss the next step in radiation therapy. If the treated areas show enough improvement, I can begin radiation therapy on my scalp and face. If not, I may have to repeat treatments on my lower body. I have had to take more time from work than anticipated, and have put myself and family behind in everything including my medical costs. Also, my dermatologist is double treating with high strength antibiotics(Cyclosporine), that are quite pricey even with my health insurance. The money would help out with travel costs to drive an hour each way to my therapy, assessments, and unplanned doctors visits. I'm not sure if I am asking for too much or too little, but anything would help out more than nothing. My main reason for opting for such radical treatment is my children. I want to be able to go outside and run and play with them. I also want to be able to seek other employment to help move to a better location, and school district. Currently with having to stay at home due to pain from abcesses, doctors visits and radiation therapy, I cannot take another job and lose my health insurance, and my FMLA approval. I tried in the spring to take another job, and my condition worsened and I was unable to get the medications I was prescribed to help control the flare-ups. Luckily my previous employer was gracious enough to re-hire me with my benefits intact and provided me medical leave for therapy. However my deductible was fairly high and I wound up taking a pretty big portion of my medical bills on 100% and there are still a lot of procedures and visits that are not covered due to the nature of my condition. I appreciate any donations small or large and will keep updating my status as time goes on. Thank you.</p>

<p><i><b>Help us continue to exceed our goal so we can send another delegate to the African Commission!</b></i><br/></p>
<p><b>1. Justice 4 Eric: The Short Version</b></p>
<p>This opportunity has emerged from the work of the <a href=""http://stpaulsfdr.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">St. Paul's Foundation for International Reconciliation</a>*, which has been working closely with several LGBT groups in Cameroon, especially the <a href=""http://camfaids.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cameroonian Foundation for AIDS</a> (CAMFAIDS). In July 2013, just weeks after speaking out publicly about the threats and violence targeting these groups, CAMFAIDS' executive director, Eric Ohena Lembembe, was <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/16/eric-ohena-lembembe-killed-dead_n_3604460.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brutally tortured and murdered</a> in his own home. Since his murder, his colleagues at CAMFAIDS and other LGBT organizations have faced escalating threats.</p>
<p>Eric's tragic fate is all too familiar in Cameroon, where people who are LGBT and their advocates regularly face threats, arrests, torture, and mob attacks.</p>
<p>We are outraged by the Cameroonian's Government's first official response to Eric's murder expressed this week in Geneva by the Cameroonian Ambassador:</p>
<p><strong>“So I reject this alleged case of this young man who allegedly was found dead as a result of his homosexuality. Distinguished Ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen, these are just things that have been made up. Look at the details of this person’s life and you will understand why he died.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have raised enough funds to sent two representatives to impress upon African leadership these attitudes are not acceptable. Homosexuality is NOT A REASON TO DIE in any country. We are now upping our goal to make sure we have a delegation of at least three Cameroonians to these conferences in October.</strong></p>
<p>But these kinds or responses and threats have not silenced these brave Cameroonian human rights defenders. Instead, they worked on a <a href=""http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/cameroon_-_african_commission_-_lgbti_rights.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">45-page report</a> to the <a href=""http://www.achpr.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> detailing the Government of Cameroon's dismal record on LGBT rights. Now, they need your help to travel to the African Commission next month to make their case in person.</p>
<p>With your financial assistance, <i><b>Africans</b></i> can stand up for the human rights of <i><b>LGBT Africans </b></i>-- the most effective and far-reaching kind of advocacy on that continent. Their voices must be heard. Eric's death must become a wake-up call for Africans to stop persecuting their gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer brothers and sisters. With your help, <i><b>the African Human Rights Commission can set a precedent for all African countries that LGBT rights are human rights.</b></i> Not just in Europe and the United States. But all across Africa, too.</p>
<p>* St. Paul's Foundation for International Reconciliation is a California-based non-profit that engages in dialogue and coalition-building between secular and religious organizations that share the same values and outcomes for marginalized people, particularly women and LGBT people.</p>
<p><b>2. Justice 4 Eric: We Can Make It Happen</b></p>
<p>The goal is to send a broad spectrum of Cameroonian organizations working on LGBT issues to attend <a href=""http://www.achpr.org/sessions/54th/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the African Human Rights Commission session in October</a>. Each additional person who can attend will increase the attention that LGBT rights will receive, amplifying their powerful message and showing strength in numbers.</p>
<p>Each $2,750 will sponsor the travel of one additional representative. We have two sponsored already and are hoping for an additional one so need to raise $5500 in this campaign. The costs we need to cover for two people are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.rumbo.com/vuelos/procstepone.do"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Airfare</a> from Cameroon to the Gambia (where the African Commission meets): $1,600 each</li>
<li>Registration for the 3-day <a href=""http://www.acdhrs.org/ngo-forum-october-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NGO Forum</a> before the session: $100</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://gambiaembassy.us/images/forms/new/visa.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Visa</a> to enter the Gambia: $100</li>
<li>7 nights in a <a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g293795-Banjul_Banjul_Division-Hotels.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hotel</a>, plus food and ground transportation: $700</li>
<li>The remaining $250 (each) costs are approximate fees for this online campaign paid to the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is $2,500 each person (and $250 for Indiegogo fees for each person totalling $5,500); meeting that goal will mean <i>one</i> more representative from another<i> </i>Cameroonian organization working on LGBT rights will be able to attend the October 2013 African Commission session and the pre-session NGO Forum. But if we exceed our goal and raise $5,000, representatives from two different groups can go. And if we raise $7,500, we can send representatives from three groups. <i><b>The more we raise, the more Cameroonian LGBT </b><b>organizations' voices will be heard</b></i>, and the more impact their voices will have with the African Commission and in the <a href=""http://www.acdhrs.org/ngo-forum/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">forum with hundreds of other African human rights groups</a>. (Any funds that do not meet one of the $2,500 benchmarks will go toward improving the security and impact of LGBT groups in Cameroon, especially CAMFAIDS, which has suffered the most from homophobic violence.)</p>
<p>Your donation will make a real difference on the ground in Africa. To show our appreciation, we also have some great gifts for you!</p>
<ul>
<li>For your donation of $25, you'll receive a video called ""Love Heals Homophobia,"" featuring four important straight African American clergy talking about their journeys to full acceptance of LGBT people and how to create congregations that celebrate diversity.</li>
<li>For your donation of $100, you'll receive a copy of <a href=""http://76crimes.com/buy-the-book-from-wrongs-to-gay-rights/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">From Wrongs to Gay Rights: Cruelty and Change for LGBT People in an Uncertain World</a>.

<li>For your donation of $1,000, you'll receive a Granite Pillar Award from St. Paul's Foundation. Emblazoned with St. Paul's logo and your name, these table-size awards honor those pillars of our community who literally support others in their work for global justice.<br/>

<li>Since Eric's murder, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/damian-ugwu/an-assault-on-a-movement_b_3792598.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">threats against other LGBT activists have escalated</a>. <br/>

They know they will be put down.""<br/>

You'll see just how dire conditions really are.</p>
<p>These brave LGBT groups in Cameroon are uniquely positioned to honor Eric's legacy and deliver the message that LGBT rights are human rights. When groups from the United States or Europe raise these concerns, the Government of Cameroon dismisses them, saying it's a matter of ""<a href=""http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/154/72/PDF/G1315472.pdf?OpenElement"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">African culture</a>."" In fact, when the Government of Cameroon submitted its <a href=""http://www.achpr.org/states/cameroon/reports/3-2008-2011/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">latest report</a> to the African Commission in April, it didn't mention LGBT rights at all. It asserts that homosexuality is a ""western import"" and falls back on references to ""<a href=""http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CCPR%2fC%2fSR.2725&amp;Lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">African values</a>"" -- values that apparently condone the torture and murder of people because they are trying to provide services to people who are at risk of HIV/AIDS. Of course, these values are not at all true African values -- but the best people to make this argument are Africans themselves.</p>
<p>When <i><b>Africans </b></i>stand up and speak for the rights of <i><b>LGBT Africans</b></i>, the Government of Cameroon has a harder time coming up with a plausible response. These groups want to attend the pre-session NGO Forum to meet with hundreds of other African human rights organizations to build momentum for the LGBT rights movement in Africa. <i><b>If, this October, the African Commission calls out the Government of Cameroon on its <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/21/cameroon-rights-abuses-homosexuality-prosecutions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">horrible human rights record for LGBT people</a>, it could set a precedent for all of the other African countries that persecute people who are LGBT.</b></i> Half of the countries in the world where it's illegal to be LGBT are in Sub-Saharan Africa, and <a href=""http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2013/06/Pew-Global-Attitudes-Homosexuality-Report-FINAL-JUNE-4-2013.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Africa is more intolerant of homosexuals than any other continent</a>, so a bold statement from the African Human Rights Commission could be groundbreaking.</p>
<p>There are signs that the African Human Rights Commission will be receptive. In July, <a href=""http://www.achpr.org/press/2013/07/d170/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Commission's expert on human rights defenders sharply condemned Eric's murder and called for the Government of Cameroon to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation</a>. The Government of Cameroon, meanwhile, has <a href=""http://democracyinafrica.org/eric-ohena-lembembe-and-the-future-of-lgbt-activism-in-cameroon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stalled its investigation and lashed out at LGBT rights groups</a> for making the government ""look bad"" in the western media.</p>
<p>These advocates speak eloquently about human rights conditions in Cameroon and the need for change. They'll use this opportunity to build support among other African human rights organizations and to press their case with the African Commission. We've worked with them in the past, including most recently to <a href=""http://76crimes.com/2013/08/19/how-cameroon-locals-others-paid-for-slain-lgbt-leaders-funeral/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">raise funds for Eric's funeral</a>.

2. Justice 4 Eric: We Can Make It Happen
The goal is to send a broad spectrum of Cameroonian organizations working on LGBT issues to attend the African Human Rights Commission session in October. Each additional person who can attend will increase the attention that LGBT rights will receive, amplifying their powerful message and showing strength in numbers.
Each $2,750 will sponsor the travel of one additional representative. We have two sponsored already and are hoping for an additional one so need to raise $5500 in this campaign. The costs we need to cover for two people are:


Airfare from Cameroon to the Gambia (where the African Commission meets): $1,600 each
Registration for the 3-day NGO Forum before the session: $100

Visa to enter the Gambia: $100
7 nights in a hotel, plus food and ground transportation: $700
The remaining $250 (each) costs are approximate fees for this online campaign paid to the site.

Our goal is $2,500 each person (and $250 for Indiegogo fees for each person totalling $5,500); meeting that goal will mean one more representative from another Cameroonian organization working on LGBT rights will be able to attend the October 2013 African Commission session and the pre-session NGO Forum. But if we exceed our goal and raise $5,000, representatives from two different groups can go. And if we raise $7,500, we can send representatives from three groups. The more we raise, the more Cameroonian LGBT organizations' voices will be heard, and the more impact their voices will have with the African Commission and in the forum with hundreds of other African human rights groups. (Any funds that do not meet one of the $2,500 benchmarks will go toward improving the security and impact of LGBT groups in Cameroon, especially CAMFAIDS, which has suffered the most from homophobic violence.)
Your donation will make a real difference on the ground in Africa. To show our appreciation, we also have some great gifts for you!

For your donation of $25, you'll receive a video called ""Love Heals Homophobia,"" featuring four important straight African American clergy talking about their journeys to full acceptance of LGBT people and how to create congregations that celebrate diversity.
For your donation of $100, you'll receive a copy of From Wrongs to Gay Rights: Cruelty and Change for LGBT People in an Uncertain World. This book includes chapters by Eric Ohena Lembembe (who was also a journalist), Erasing 76 Crimes blog editor Colin Stewart, Reverend Albert Ogle of St. Paul's Foundation, Miles Tanhira, Andy Kopsa, Rachel Adams, and Clare Byarugaba.
For your donation of $1,000, you'll receive a Granite Pillar Award from St. Paul's Foundation. Emblazoned with St. Paul's logo and your name, these table-size awards honor those pillars of our community who literally support others in their work for global justice.


3. Justice 4 Eric: The Impact
Your donation will make a tangible contribution to promoting LGBT rights in Africa. LGBT people face severe persecution in Cameroon:

Many countries prohibit private, consensual, adult sexual conduct between people of the same sex. But unlike many of those countries, the Government of Cameroon is increasingly enforcing its law, even applying it to non-sexual conduct like ordering a particular drink in a bar or sending an affectionate text message.

A vigilante youth group patrols the streets twice a week--and they say the government endorses their work--to ""hunt down"" homosexuals and either beat them up or hand them over to police for arrest. The group has marched the streets calling for people to kill LGBT Cameroonians.
Since Eric's murder, threats against other LGBT activists have escalated. 

A leader of Cameroon's own Commission for Human Rights recently warned LGBT activists -- just weeks before the African Commission meeting and another meeting of the U.N.'s Human Rights Council -- that if they ""denigrate their country abroad in international bodies and then complain that they are insecure when they return to their home country -- they themselves are responsible for what happens. They know they will be put down.""


For further information, please read the report that these groups on the ground in Cameroon will present to the African Commission. You'll see just how dire conditions really are.
These brave LGBT groups in Cameroon are uniquely positioned to honor Eric's legacy and deliver the message that LGBT rights are human rights. When groups from the United States or Europe raise these concerns, the Government of Cameroon dismisses them, saying it's a matter of ""African culture."" In fact, when the Government of Cameroon submitted its latest report to the African Commission in April, it didn't mention LGBT rights at all. It asserts that homosexuality is a ""western import"" and falls back on references to ""African values"" -- values that apparently condone the torture and murder of people because they are trying to provide services to people who are at risk of HIV/AIDS. Of course, these values are not at all true African values -- but the best people to make this argument are Africans themselves.
When Africans stand up and speak for the rights of LGBT Africans, the Government of Cameroon has a harder time coming up with a plausible response. These groups want to attend the pre-session NGO Forum to meet with hundreds of other African human rights organizations to build momentum for the LGBT rights movement in Africa. If, this October, the African Commission calls out the Government of Cameroon on its horrible human rights record for LGBT people, it could set a precedent for all of the other African countries that persecute people who are LGBT. Half of the countries in the world where it's illegal to be LGBT are in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Africa is more intolerant of homosexuals than any other continent, so a bold statement from the African Human Rights Commission could be groundbreaking.
There are signs that the African Human Rights Commission will be receptive. In July, the Commission's expert on human rights defenders sharply condemned Eric's murder and called for the Government of Cameroon to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation. The Government of Cameroon, meanwhile, has stalled its investigation and lashed out at LGBT rights groups for making the government ""look bad"" in the western media.
These advocates speak eloquently about human rights conditions in Cameroon and the need for change. They'll use this opportunity to build support among other African human rights organizations and to press their case with the African Commission. We've worked with them in the past, including most recently to raise funds for Eric's funeral. So you know your donation will be put to great use.
4. Justice 4 Eric: Other Ways To Help
Even if you can't contribute financially, there are real ways you can help. First, learn about what's going on in Cameroon. Second, spread the word about this campaign -- use the handy indiegogo share tools! Third, encourage the bloggers you read to devote more attention to LGBT rights in Africa. Finally, stay tuned for updates from the African Human Rights Commission meeting October 18-25 -- if our colleagues can be there, the meeting has the potential to be a turning point for LGBT rights in Africa!

99.9% of the population uses either, some sort of reusable towel, paper towel or nothing at all to dry their hands after washing them in their home whether it be in their kitchen, bathroom or elsewhere.
The problem with drying your hands with a reusable towel is that unless you wash the towel after every use, it will build up with germs and bacteria, making cleaning your hands counter-productive.

Bacteria needs three elements to thrive: organic material, warmth and moisture and a used towel provides all three.

Towels pick up dead skin cells, get wet and sit in warm and moist conditions in the bathroom.
This makes them the perfect home for bacteria.
Using paper towels to dry your hands is not an environmentally conscious, hygienic, and financially responsible option.

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, 28.5% of municipal solid waste produced is paper waste.
By using HÖMDRY you will significantly lower your carbon footprint and solid waste production.
 In fact, up to 88% of unused paper towels in the U.S. contain bacteria, which can transfer to your hands.  The cost of using HÖMDRY is up to 97% cheaper yearly than using paper towels.   Currently there are alternatives for your home:Unfortunately, they are expensive, clumsy, wired, very difficult to install, in other words there is nothing available that is Built Home Conscious™ like HÖMDRY.

Built Home Conscious™ means a product is specifically designed and engineered for home and personal use.
There are many products that are dual use: commercial and personal use.
However, to be Built Home Conscious™ a product needs to meet certain criteria to be perfectly suited for home use.
 1. Space Conscious
HÖMDRY is specifically sized to fit comfortably in a home bathroom or home kitchen.   Standing on it's base, HÖMDRY is 17.91 inches tall, 6.5 inches wide and 9.51 inches deep.   Mounted on the wall, HÖMDRY is 22.64 inches tall, 6.13 inches wide and 9.14 inches deep.  2. Easy Installation

HÖMDRY comes with everything you need to easily set up on the standing dock and has an easy mounting kit for wall use.
A manual for setup is included, but not needed.
What's in the box?  Everything below.
 3. Learning Curve
HÖMDRY has little to no learning curve for first time use.
HÖMDRY's ON button is triggered by its hand sensor placed exactly where your hands need to be.  4. Life Cycle

HÖMDRY is equipped with a lithium-ion battery.
On a full charge the wireless battery lasts 1,920 session, and an average of 480 days or 1.3 years.
 5. Maintenance  The only hands-on maintenance needed is taking out the HEPA filter once every 3 months and cleaning it for under 20 seconds.  6. Accessibility
HÖMDRY's wireless functionality is specifically engineered to be used standing on your counter or mounted on your wall. 360° View of HÖMDRY and it's components:
 


 

 
     Place HÖMDRY with base on your kitchen or bathroom counter.ORUse the included mounting kit to secure your mount on wall and place HÖMDRY with its external battery onto the wall mount.NEXT
After washing your hands, place hands underneath the hood of HÖMDRY.
Built in sensor will detect your hands and automatically run a patented session of Warm Air and UV Blue Light.
Heated HEPA filtered air will blow out at 2x the speed of a normal industrial hand dryer.
FINISHED
After 16 seconds.
Dry and clean hands.
Facts:
Each session last 16 seconds.
Our patented process blows heated air the entire 16 seconds and shines our Blue UV Light for the last 8 seconds of each session.
Blue UV Light is safe on skin and proven to kill bacteria soap can miss.
Charging time takes 3 hours for a full battery.

HÖMDRY is safe and the most environmentally cautious option to drying your hands in your home.

HÖMDRY is currently the only hand dryer Built Home Conscious™.

Stretch Goals:
Check back here as the project progresses to find out more about our planned secret perks.We have some in mind that we think you're going to love!     About Us:We're a team with a straightforward vision.  We love building products that solve real world problems.  Our team focuses on innovative, futuristic items.  HÖMDRY was one of those ideas that just clicked instantly.  We couldn't figure out why we had never seen a hand dryer in anyone's home. After researching, we learned that there is nothing built for a home - from all aspects including: size, cost and practicality.  Also, from our research we learned about all the environmental benefits of using a hand dryer instead of paper towels.  As well, we learned about the sanitary benefits of hand dryers over reusable towels.  This was a no brainer and we were excited.  We channeled our excitement and built an amazing product!What We Bring To The Table:We've had an amazing journey coming to where we are today with HÖMDRY, and now feel confident we will deliver a true life changing product in a timely matter.  We have extensive skills in the following areas:

The struggle is real.)  Say goodbye to changing in the back seat of your car, awkward towel changing in public, and public restrooms. The Undercover Version 2.0 is FASTER, QUICKER, and more convenient - saving you time, hassle, and frustration.The Undercover V2 was designed to solve the problem of having to do outdoor wardrobe changes. This amazing patent-pending design is not available anywhere else, take a look.  How it Works (for bottoms): The Undercover V2 is designed to cover you up securely by a drawstring, and with it’s featured patent pending Side Access Openings, it allows you to access anything you need to remove. To redress, reverse the process. Slip out. Bam. That simple. You know you need it.  It's perfect for the ladies too!Change into and out of sports bras, shirts, bikinis, and more with ease!  How it Works (for Tops): Ladies, you can now change your top without any embarrassing slips!  To start, slide The Undercover over your head and loosen the cord lock.  Next, slip your head into the strap loop and cinch the cord lock behind your neck to secure.  Then, you can remove your top or bra from the top or from underneath using the Side Access Openings (best for bikini tops and traditional bras).  Reverse the process to wear a new top. Bam. Faster and more secure than a towel.  It also converts to a backpack! (Yes, really!)When your change is complete, zip it up, attach the clips, adjust to fit, and The Undercover 2.0 becomes a convenient Backpack.   You’ll wonder how you ever “adventured” without it.  With The Undercover, you're ready for anything! 
New and improved!NEW technical fabric is even more durable, water repellent and moisture resistant. It’s machine washable. It’s perfect for people of all shapes and sizes. Now weighing in at approximately 4.8 ounces, it’s 1/3 the weight of the original, and half the size - you’ll hardly notice it’s there. Easily tuck The Undercover 2.0 in your luggage, glove compartment, or clip it to your pack and take it with you.    The Undercover is the world's first mobile ""changing room"" of it's kind.  Use it for instant privacy, so you can change clothes anywhere with ease. Version 2.0 Includes 9 Brand New Features + Upgrades!

You can use the same Internal Pocket to fold it into itself! The Undercover V2 only weighs 4.8 ounces (Less than half a can of beer!) and is much smaller and compact than a bulky towel. Keep one in your gear bag, glove compartment so you are ready for anything.    Ultra-Lightweight:NOW 73% LIGHTER, AND MORE COMPACT than the original version!  PERFECT FOR TRAVEL!  More compact than a bulky Towel: Better than one, too. The Undercover is much smaller than trying to lug your big bulky fluffy beach towel around just to do your clothing changes.

We are Kansas Quidditch and at the Midwest Regionals, we qualified to move on to the next stage of competition, the World Cup! The World Cup is the premier tournament for quidditch and the end goal for all teams! Last year we finished in 5th place with a 6-1 record falling only to World Cup runner-up UCLA in the Elite Eight. Getting to this level however has been extremely taxing on our resources, we played in many tournaments around the Midwest and have the bruises and injuries to prove it, all the practice and preparation in tournaments leading up to our Regionals placed a great deal of stress on our treasury. We have one final push to fundraise in getting to the World Cup VII and any help would be greatly appreciated! We hope to get to the World Cup and continue the winning tradition of Kansas and make an impact on the game of quidditch at a national level.</p><p></p><h3>Goal</h3><p>We set a goal of $800 which would supplement the travel to and from South Carolina and would simplify all travel and monetary constraints of the club. Any remaining funds would be placed in our account with the University of Kansas and kept safe for the future in the following year.</p><p></p><h3>Individual Donation</h3><p>If you know a certain player on the team you'd like to help raise funds for, we'd be more than happy to ensure that a VERY LARGE portion of that donation goes to that player! Send us a message or leave a comment with who and we'll see that the donation goes to that player!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The impact of your donation would be enormous. Any donation is appreciated and will help the club tremendously. All donations can be guaranteed to go directly to the club and into our club's account at the bursar's office at KU.</p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Sharing this campaign with friends, family, or anyone helps greatly! Getting our campaign out there is the first step to helping us realize our goal!</p><p></p></div>","SummaryHello!

Getting to this level however has been extremely taxing on our resources, we played in many tournaments around the Midwest and have the bruises and injuries to prove it, all the practice and preparation in tournaments leading up to our Regionals placed a great deal of stress on our treasury. We have one final push to fundraise in getting to the World Cup VII and any help would be greatly appreciated! We hope to get to the World Cup and continue the winning tradition of Kansas and make an impact on the game of quidditch at a national level.GoalWe set a goal of $800 which would supplement the travel to and from South Carolina and would simplify all travel and monetary constraints of the club. Any remaining funds would be placed in our account with the University of Kansas and kept safe for the future in the following year.Individual DonationIf you know a certain player on the team you'd like to help raise funds for, we'd be more than happy to ensure that a VERY LARGE portion of that donation goes to that player! Send us a message or leave a comment with who and we'll see that the donation goes to that player!The ImpactThe impact of your donation would be enormous. Any donation is appreciated and will help the club tremendously. All donations can be guaranteed to go directly to the club and into our club's account at the bursar's office at KU.Other Ways You Can HelpSharing this campaign with friends, family, or anyone helps greatly!

<h2>What <em>is</em> this?</h2>
<p>I am now trying to save up money to get top surgery*!</p>
<p>I experience extreme dysphoria (discomfort) in regards to my chest. From getting dressed in the morning to being awkwardly stared at in town, my chest prevents me from having 1 day without anxiety.</p>
<p>It may seem like I don't care so much about not having a flat chest, but I can almost guarantee that for every time you think about the appearance of your hair, your clothes, your make-up--I've thought about my chest at least 20 times more. This is a daily struggle for me, and top surgery is the absolute best solution. It is also my #1 priority when it comes to my transition and saving money.</p>
<p><em>* ""Top surgery"" means that I'll be getting a sort of bilateral mastectomy--but the kind that will make my chest look like a typical male chest. Many female-to-male transgender people get this surgery done so that they can feel comfortable when they do every day tasks--take a shower, get dressed, go swimming, get undressed, or just walk around without having to feel extremely uncomfortable about having a female chest.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Okay, so what do you want?</h3>
<p>It may seem like a lot to ask for $6,500 (42.000kr), but I'll explain why it's so expensive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Incision top surgery performed by Dr. Charles Garramone in Sunrise, Florida, costs $6,500 for surgery <em>alone</em>. (<a href=""http://drgarramone.com/blog/costs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://drgarramone.com/blog/costs/</a>)</li>
<li>Any money I save on the side will go to travel (getting from Sweden to Florida and back. (approx. $800 or 5.000kr)</li>
<li>I also have to pay to live in Florida for a little over a week so that I can see the surgeon for post-op check ups. Hotel prices vary, but regardless, I have to pay for food and housing for over a week.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach my goal of $6,500, any donations I receive will be put into a bank account specifically set up for surgery savings. I will be putting money into that bank account every month as well. If I receive more than $6,500 (if that could ever happen...) the extra money will go to travel and living costs while I'm in Florida.</p>

<h3>Why are you doing this...</h3>
<p>I've been out as transgender for almost 3 years now, and I've been taking testosterone for 8 months. I've come very far in the past few years regarding my gender transition, both mentally and physically! But I seem to be held back by my chest. As dramatic as it may sound to you, I still feel like I'm trapped in a cage of discomfort that I have to walk around with all day, every day. I've learned to ignore that specific part of my body--a very unhealthy way to go about your daily life, obviously. Now I've had enough of the discomfort.</p>
<p>Top surgery for me is more than just looking better or being ""attractive."" It's about getting by from day to day. It's about being able to accept and love my own body.</p>
<p>Any size donation will be infinitely appreciated. Just the idea of being accepted and supported for who I really am is huge to me. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>I'd love to help, but I have no money!</h3>
<p>I just got my first job and I haven't gotten a pay check yet, so the feeling of $0 in the bank is familiar to me. If you can't afford to donate any money:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Share with someone who maybe can! Use Facebook, Twitter, or any social networking site. Or maybe an LGBT group that you know organizes fundraising for this kind of thing? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask a parent for maybe $5, or billionaire relative for $5,000! Who knows...</p>

<p>I am Jamie.  I am a wife, a mother of 4 and a critical care nurse.  I have a rare genetic disease called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS).  EDS is a connective tissue disease, meaning that it can affect anything in my body made of connective tissue.  For me, this has been my joints and my gastrointestinal system.  I also have several associated disorders.  I have a chiari malformation, which means that the very bottom of the back of my brain has slipped into my spinal column and is putting pressure on my brainstem and causing many neurological symptoms.  I also have tethered cord syndrome.  This means that my spinal cord does not freely float at the bottom of my spine.  Instead, it is attached or tethered to the bones by tissue.  This means that when I bend or move my spinal cord stretches.  </p>
<p>All of the above has caused symptoms such as severe headaches, vertigo and dizziness, hand and leg weakness, loss of sensation in my arms/legs, speech problems, swallowing difficulties, very high pressure in my head (blocked spinal fluid), loss of function in hands/legs, neck pain, back pain, shoulder pain, tremors, and vision problems.  It can lead to more severe problems including paralysis and death.</p>
<p><strong>What I need</strong></p>
<p>Since these are such rare conditions, they require extensive travel to treat.  Local physicians generally do not treat these conditions.  I travel to Cincinnati OH to see the geneticist who helps with the EDS.  My chiari and tethered cord are treated by a neurosurgeon, Dr Henderson, in Maryland, nearly 600 miles away.  There are no neuro's closer who understand and treat chiari and TC while keeping in mind the complications of EDS.  </p>
<p>This fall, Dr Henderson will be performing at least 2 surgeries to help slow and maybe even reverse some of the symptoms that I have.  The first will be a ""detethering"" surgery.  This is to detach the spinal cord from my bones.  The second will be a ""decompression"".  This is brain surgery to make room around the base of my head and relieve pressure.  </p>
<p>The cost will be tremendous.  The first surgery requires a deposit of $3900.  The second surgery requires a deposit of $9000.  That is a total of $12,900.  I do not have that.  There will also be the cost of driving the 1200 mile round trip each time, the follow up visits, the week long motel stays after surgery, before I am able to make the trip home, food and necessitities.  </p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contributions will help me have the surgeries that I need so that I can maintain my current functioning.  It will help me continue to be a good mother and it will help me continue to be a nurse.  Without these surgeries, I'm just not sure what will happen.</p>

Yes  that right they are laying off workers at one establishment and rehiring people with a 20-30% pay cut, no union protection, limited benefits and no sick or pto time that the worker had previous to their layoff.  This tactic is planned to continue unless the healthcare workers stand up for what they know is right for the community.  All the workers want is to be able to transfer the most qualified staff to where the jobs are going not be replaced by less qualified staff.  The staff has been on strike for 9 days and locked out since. We want to cooperate and negotiate but the hospital administration refuses, often times walking away from the table and never coming back.  There is no end in sight for this health care tragedy.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">These 800 people are without health insurance or a way to pay for their expenses. There is no income coming in for most families. People are filing for employment, going to food panties, there are no </span>guarantees for anyone in this.  There are roughly 250 scab workers doing the job of 800 in a fully functioning hospital, jeopardizing the communities well-being and how medical care is given to them.</p><p>  The only way this union can stay together in solidarity is for support from the community.  While we are strong now we need to remain this way but support financially. The hospital needs to know that we can survive on our own without their help. This is done by providing for our own in a time of need.

Yes  that right they are laying off workers at one establishment and rehiring people with a 20-30% pay cut, no union protection, limited benefits and no sick or pto time that the worker had previous to their layoff.  This tactic is planned to continue unless the healthcare workers stand up for what they know is right for the community.  All the workers want is to be able to transfer the most qualified staff to where the jobs are going not be replaced by less qualified staff.  The staff has been on strike for 9 days and locked out since. We want to cooperate and negotiate but the hospital administration refuses, often times walking away from the table and never coming back.  There is no end in sight for this health care tragedy.These 800 people are without health insurance or a way to pay for their expenses. There is no income coming in for most families. People are filing for employment, going to food panties, there are no guarantees for anyone in this.  There are roughly 250 scab workers doing the job of 800 in a fully functioning hospital, jeopardizing the communities well-being and how medical care is given to them.  The only way this union can stay together in solidarity is for support from the community.  While we are strong now we need to remain this way but support financially. The hospital needs to know that we can survive on our own without their help. This is done by providing for our own in a time of need. Each person needs to feel the support the community has to offer. I am asking for donation not to support myself but to support the lives of those that are now without insurance, money and jobs.  Those families that have single parents supporting children with no income coming in.  If we can provide for those with the least support now we will remain strong in the future.  The money will be used to help those who need money for groceries, medical expenses and more depending on what we can raise.  This is a time to pay it forward and show people there is humanity and community still out there in the United States.

<p>Sadly, with the current economic crisis, young adults are  woefully unemployed.  This future business will help create jobs on all levels...picking, pressing and packing...and shipping!   And, of course, we would like to create an authentic, extra virgin olive oil that will ultimatley come from ""junior"", your adopted tree...<em>From Your Tree, to Your Table!</em></p>
<p>Greece is at crossroads.  The economic crisis is hardly over.  The country and its citizens are taking an international beating and what better time to remind the world that Greece is beautiful, exceptional, resilient and hardworking. Nobel Prize Poet Elytis had once said, ""If you deconstruct Greece, at the end you will see that you are left with an olive tree, a vineyard and a boat. Which means that you can rebuild it.""

This lab analyzed all the spirits and olive oil samples of the region for quality control.  As the sons of Peter’s grandfather decided on other lines of work the lab was continued through the cousin, Mr Petros Boufeas.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Oops, one too many zeros in the goal amount...and I can't change it...sorry:(<br/><span style=""""><font color=""#000000"">My name is Christina (Kiki) Hilario and Iâ€™m the stay home
mother of a little girl, Genevieve Hilario.<span style="""">  10 years ago, my husband David and I, were blessed with our first of two girls. As with all new families, we knew our lives would change, however it was not until her birth did we understand to what gravity our lives would be altered. Moments after her birth, the doctor notified us that our daughter</span></font><font color=""#000000""> was born with Spina Bifida. There was a hole in her back which allowed her spinal column to be exposed. During the first 30 days in utero, the spinal column did not fuse together properly and therefore no vertebrae or skin had formed in this area. It is called a Myelomeningocele. Due to the severity of this medical deformation, she had to be transfered immediately into Nebraskra and have her first of <strong><u>over 80 surgeries and procedures.</u></strong> </font></span></p>
<p><span style=""""><font color=""#000000"">Within hours her neurosurgeon and repaired her back, but that would only cause
Hydrocephalus to then take engage. Gen's brain cannot reabsorb the CSF (Cerebral Spinal Fluid) like others. Without a Ventricular Shunt her brain would swell and eventually end her life (this took place with my uncle - he died at the age of two from Hydrocephalus caused by Spina Bifida).  Shortly after a shunt was placed into the middle of her brain and burrowed down her neck where roughly two feet of tubing coils in her abdomen. </font></span></p>
<p><span style=""""><font color=""#000000"">Not only was Genevieve subject to these issues, the Spina Bifida brought a host of other medical conditions that have ruled our lives. Arnold Chiari II Malformation of the Brain (ACM II) is also indigenous to this birth defect. This is when the Cerebrum (large top portion of the brain) tilts backwards.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">We are asking you to join with our tiny community in helping us give Gen the best care we possibly can. Since we live in a tiny town, David has to take the best paying job he can that will allow him grace periods for the frequent emergency trips and stays to Children's Hospital. I stay home to ensure the best care for both my girls. Because Gen's medical issues dictate so much of our lives, it is a blessing to be able to homeschool my 9 year old daughter as well. This allows me the opportunity to have close time with her also. With a household gross income less than 20,000 a year. It is difficult to attain our medical goals, never mind the regular bills. Ha! Ha! We live according to our means in a nice little home, but every extra cent goes to supply Gen with medications and therapies. Unfortunately, with our income, she doesn't get all that she needs as much as she needs it. This is why we have decided to open our lives up, humbly receiving assistance, and providing the world a glimpse into a world that most people will never understand or know personally. </font></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Oops, one too many zeros in the goal amount...and I can't change it...sorry:(My name is Christina (Kiki) Hilario and Iâ€™m the stay home
mother of a little girl, Genevieve Hilario.  10 years ago, my husband David and I, were blessed with our first of two girls. As with all new families, we knew our lives would change, however it was not until her birth did we understand to what gravity our lives would be altered. Moments after her birth, the doctor notified us that our daughter was born with Spina Bifida. There was a hole in her back which allowed her spinal column to be exposed. During the first 30 days in utero, the spinal column did not fuse together properly and therefore no vertebrae or skin had formed in this area. It is called a Myelomeningocele. Due to the severity of this medical deformation, she had to be transfered immediately into Nebraskra and have her first of over 80 surgeries and procedures. 
Within hours her neurosurgeon and repaired her back, but that would only cause
Hydrocephalus to then take engage. Gen's brain cannot reabsorb the CSF (Cerebral Spinal Fluid) like others. Without a Ventricular Shunt her brain would swell and eventually end her life (this took place with my uncle - he died at the age of two from Hydrocephalus caused by Spina Bifida).  Shortly after a shunt was placed into the middle of her brain and burrowed down her neck where roughly two feet of tubing coils in her abdomen. 
Not only was Genevieve subject to these issues, the Spina Bifida brought a host of other medical conditions that have ruled our lives. Arnold Chiari II Malformation of the Brain (ACM II) is also indigenous to this birth defect. This is when the Cerebrum (large top portion of the brain) tilts backwards. In conjuction with this, the Cerebellum is then shifted back so far that a portion of the brain actually sits tucked in the spinal column within her neck. In Gen's Case, the ACM II portion of the brain became damaged. In doing so, her fourth ventricle in her brain was colapsed and pressure was put against her Brain Stem. The Brain Stem not only controls swallowing but many other vital functions within the body. The Cerebellar Tonsils were removed from within her neck when she was 3 1/2 and a portion of her skull was removed to allow for reoccuring swelling of the brain. 
Since Genevieve's birth, Neurogenic Bladder
& Bowels have proven to be (in addition to the other health concerns) a constant battle. She has never had the function to potty or poop so I have spent the first 5 plus years catheterizing Gen's potty and digitally removing her stool. Vesicourital Reflux (when the bladder refluxes urine back into the kidneys), infection, medical supplies, medications and the alike are a daily challenge for our household. 
In addition to the above challenges, Hypothalamic Dysfunction (inability to control her body temperature), Physical Therapy (she uses leg braces), accupuncture, chirophractic care, and massage and pain management guide our everyday schedule. 
As I mentioned, Genevieve at the age of 10 has had over 80 plus surgeries and procedures. Children's Hospital has been home away from home. She lives in constant chronic pain of migrains coupled with ""Ice Pick"" headaches and ""Cluster"" headaches on top of the migraines.

Even though we continue to get declined at different facilities, we are forever trying to find alternative ways to help our little girl live a life of quality.

<p>Southcoast Zodiacs also volunter their time to get involved in projects to help the local Community as well as local and Worldwide Charities. For example last year 2 of our lads in aid of a local hospice dressed in drag and took part in a theatre show of Priscilla Queen of the Dessert.</p>
<p>The Senior girls cheered at a local football match between our local football players and the boys from the British Soap Opera Hollyoaks, to help raise funds for the local Childrens Hospice.</p>
<p>The Coaches have absailed down 90ft Cliffs in aid of Macmillan Cancer Research, and many of the female athletes have ran the 'Race for Life' all for Breast Cancer UK.</p>
<p>This year the Athletes have thought it would be a great idea to do something a little different.</p>
<p>The Southcoast Zodiacs will be running &amp; cycling a total of 85 miles, thats 145km in aid of a Local Childrens charity and to help raise funds for a once in a lifetime event.</p>
<p>Each Athlete will run a total of 21km (Brighton Pier to Goring Gap), they will then the following week complete a 124km cycle ride along Southdowns way to Guildford and back.</p>
<p>The Southcoast Zodiacs will be raising money for the NSPCC and also their local Childrens Hospice Chesnut Tree House. They will also be raising the funds for a once in a lifetime event, a trip to compete at one of the Worlds Largest National Competitions 'Cheersport Nationals' in Atlanta Georgia.</p>
<p>We are aiming to raise a total of £6000.00 (if we raise more even better) 25% of which will go to Charity, the other 75% will go towards taking the 40 athletes to America for the very first time. It is even some of the Athletes first ever vacation away from the UK.</p>
<p>By donating not only will you be helping Children and Young adults who have dedicated most of their Cheerleading Career to helping others and their local community; reach their dream in travelling to America, you will also be helping towards stopping child abuse and giving children and families with critical illnesses the respite care they need.</p>

<p><b>Sven-Anders Alwerud President/Co-founder Jelly Skateboards Inc.</b><br/> </p>
<p>""Jelly Skateboards originated from two Southern California locals with a passion for speed, surfing and skating. At just 15 years old, high school buddies Sven Alwerud and Cody Leuck began to design their ideal carving machine-hacking away at crude prototypes made of bulletproof glass, in a side garage nonetheless. </p>
<p>But the big ""AH-HA"" moment didn't come until some years later, when Sven was attending college at Cal State San Marcos and had been using the old high school prototype to cruise from class to class. The clear deck was a hit-other students loved the original take on a classic concept. So Alwerud and Leuck were back in the board game once again. They began crafting prototypes in Cal State Chico's machine shop where Cody had been attending school. By combining vintage shapes and modern cutting edge materials Alwerud and Leuck were able to create a bulletproof, clear, flexible skateboard that captured the essence of surfing and snowboarding. In March of 2012, the company was officially incorporated and Jelly Skateboards was born.""</p> <p> </p>

<p>Kevin graduated from Kansas State University in 2009 with his bachelors degree in Construction Science and Business Management. He continued on to Southern California where he accepted a position with Hensel Phelps, one of the largest general contractors and construction managers in the United States. Hensel Phelps is ranked consistently among ENR's (Engineering News-Record) top 20 Contractors with an annual revenue of over $3 billion dollars.  For over six years, Kevin has played a vital engineering role for Hensel Phelps, managing high profile commercial projects including the Renovation of LAX Terminal 6 for Alaska Airlines and the Reconfiguration of San Ysidro Land Port of Entry Border Crossing into Mexico--the largest land port entry in the World.  Currently, Kevin is working with Hensel Phelps as a Design-Build Contractor for GSA planning, and coordinating the renovation and modernization of the downtown San Diego Federal building.</p>In 2012 an idea was born to create a more functional skateboard riser.  So B+ Ideas LLC was founded on this passion for skateboarding and building.  Since then Kevin has spent spent  his nights and weekends over the last three years prototyping and 3D printing risers that think outside the box.  In 2013 the StashBLOCK was born and not until 2014 did we realized we had something truly special with the BettyBOX riser system.  We were able to create any insert we wanted with only the deck and trucks the limit.  Now it is my responsibility to bring the skateboard community the best and most innovative BLOCKs you could imagine. </div><div style=""text-align: center;""> <p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is the board made out of?</p>
<p>A: Bulletproof glass</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Is that really glass?</p>
<p>A: No, silly! It’s a thermoplastic polymer (plastic) that was invented in 1898 by a German scientist working at University of Munich. Polycarbonate can be found in the F-22 Raptor cockpit canopy, Humvee windows, bank windows, International Space Station, the list goes on and on! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Is there grip?</p>
<p>A: We currently don’t offer grip, but the way we like to describe the grip is the same grippyness one feels when they are playing basketball on an indoor wood court. The squeaky sensation that you get between your shoes and the gym floor is the same feeling you get when riding a Jelly. Also, the new Man O’ War Longboard has concave that help lock in your feet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Is it durable or will it break?</p>
<p>A: Polycarbonate is extremely durable and possesses high-impact strength all while being 100% recyclable under classification “7”. We offer a six-month warranty and will send another board if structural damage arises whether by a manufacturer’s defect or by personal use, no questions asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Does it scratch easy?</p>
<p>A: Yes, yes it does. Just like any skateboard out there, they will get scratched up. That’s just the nature of <u>the sport.</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>BLOCK</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is a riser BLOCK? </p>
<p>A: A riser BLOCK is the most convenient way to add some innovation and style to your skateboard while also preventing wheel bite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is wheel bite? </p>
<p>A: Wheel bite is when the skateboard wheel makes contact with the bottom of the deck while turning sharply.  This contact causes the wheel to stop rolling and likely sends you to make contact with the pavement! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: BLOCK risers are angled, what does that do? </p>
<p>A: An angled BLOCK allows you to “wedge” or “de-wedge” your trucks; therefore changing the geometry of your trucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Changing the geometry, what does that mean? </p>
<p>A: When the geometry of the truck changes, it changes your turning radius.  If you wedge your trucks, you can increase the amount of rotation on the truck.  Therefore, you can turn in a smaller circle.</p>
<p>If you dewedge your trucks, it will give the board a less reactive feel.  Your turning will be less so it will take a larger area to turn in the same circle, and the skateboard will be more stable at higher speeds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is a Standard-Kingpin or Reverse-Kingpin?</p>
<p>A: First off, the Kingpin is the center bolt that allows the axle to pivot side to side.</p>
<p>Standard-Kingpin Trucks are often found on beach cruisers, and street skateboards that have either one or two kick tails.  The center bolts on the trucks are on the inside of the skateboard.  Reference the Jelly KingSlayer.</p>
<p>Reverse-Kingpin Trucks are often seen on longboards and allow for greater turning ability and a lower profile setup.  The center bolt would be on the outside of skateboard.  Reference the Jelly Man O’ War.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How is the Jelly Man O’War setup?</p>
<p>A: The Jelly Man O’War will come set-up dewedged to allow for the most stable ride possible.  This also provides a true front and rear view with your GoBLOCK.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between wedging and dewedging?</p>
<p>A: Wedging and dewedging are the same, no matter whether you have a Standard-Kingpin and Reverse-Kingpin truck(s): the fat side toward the center of the skateboard will “wedge” and make that truck turn more; the fat side toward the ends of the skateboard will “de-wedge” and make that truck turn less.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can you wedge and dewedge at the same time? </p>
<p>A: Several wedging characteristics can be experimented with.  Just steer clear of dewedging the front and wedging the rear: you don't want the back of your board to turn more than the front. We call that “forklift steering” and it never ends well...</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Q: Should I wedge or dewedge? </p>
<p>A: That will mostly depend on the style of riding you are doing as well as your personal preference. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can’t I just tighten the kingpin? </p>
<p>A: Tightening the kingpin only restricts the range of motion by slowing the turning action down and making it harder or easier to lean the board. Wedging (de-wedging) changes how much your board turns when you do lean it.   Use your wrench to adjust kingpin tension for fine-tuning after you've decided on wedging (or none) and the proper bushing is chosen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Proper bushing, is there going to be a test?</p>
<p>A: There will not be a test, but changing the hardness (durometer) of your bushing increases or decreases the turning response.  This is based on rider weight and personal preference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Do I have to wedge or dewedge? </p>
<p>A: The short answer is no, the high tech skateboard trucks available today allow for some great turning abilities but sometimes they still cause wheel bite.  In this case BLOCK will soon offer both the BettyBOX and StandardBLOCK as a standard flat risers so you can still take advantage of the most innovative #*?# ever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can I eliminate wheel bite without this complicated wedging or riser sizing? </p>
<p>A: Yes, but this involves changing your wheel size or skateboard deck all together. Risers and/or wedging is way less complicated than that!  So, add a set of BLOCK risers and eliminate the hassle of buying the more expensive components.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: BLOCK doesn’t have the size riser that I think I need, what gives? </p>
<p>A: Soon my friend, soon we will have risers of all sizes for your skateboard needs.  Right now, we've got the sizes most skaters are going to use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I have the BettyBOX but the opening doesn’t face the direction I want my camera pointed? </p>
<p>A: The more money we raise, the more BLOCK riser innovations you will see.  Hang tight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: So my current skateboard doesn’t have wheel bite and I love my skateboard the way it is, why do I need BLOCK risers? </p>
<p>A: Because it is the most innovative #*?# ever.  Give your skateboard its own set of eyes with a GoBLOCK or store your house key and a few dollars and a stick of gum in the StashBLOCK.  Plus, you will want to have a BettyBOX to take advantage of all of the other cool things we have in store for you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I have a drop through skateboard deck, what about me? </p>
<p>A: Relax compadre, pair the BettyBOX with a TopBLOCK and you will be GoBLOCKing and StashBLOCKing in no time.  You’ve also just bought yourself one fancy toe-stop!</p>
<p>With today’s high tech line-up of skateboard trucks and the vast array of wheel sizes, customization is endless.  If the set-up you choose allows the wheels to touch the bottom of the skateboard while turning, your wheel will likely stop in its tracks and send you to the pavement.  Add in a set of BLOCK risers and you can experience those sharp turns safely without having wheel bite.</p>
<p>BLOCK risers fit all Old School &amp; New School mounting patterns.</p>
<p>BLOCK risers go hand-in-hand with the high tech skateboard trucks on today’s market.</p>
<p>BLOCK risers are a skateboard performance enhancement to keep your wheels from hitting the bottom of your board and locking up while turning from side to side. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is next for the BettyBOX?</p>
<p>A: While we have several products in the line-up we will do customer polling to see what you want next!</p>

Sven-Anders Alwerud President/Co-founder Jelly Skateboards Inc. 
""Jelly Skateboards originated from two Southern California locals with a passion for speed, surfing and skating. At just 15 years old, high school buddies Sven Alwerud and Cody Leuck began to design their ideal carving machine-hacking away at crude prototypes made of bulletproof glass, in a side garage nonetheless. 
But the big ""AH-HA"" moment didn't come until some years later, when Sven was attending college at Cal State San Marcos and had been using the old high school prototype to cruise from class to class. The clear deck was a hit-other students loved the original take on a classic concept. So Alwerud and Leuck were back in the board game once again. They began crafting prototypes in Cal State Chico's machine shop where Cody had been attending school. By combining vintage shapes and modern cutting edge materials Alwerud and Leuck were able to create a bulletproof, clear, flexible skateboard that captured the essence of surfing and snowboarding. In March of 2012, the company was officially incorporated and Jelly Skateboards was born.""

Q: What is the board made out of?
A: Bulletproof glass
 
Q: Is that really glass?
A: No, silly! It’s a thermoplastic polymer (plastic) that was invented in 1898 by a German scientist working at University of Munich. Polycarbonate can be found in the F-22 Raptor cockpit canopy, Humvee windows, bank windows, International Space Station, the list goes on and on! 
 
Q: Is there grip?
A: We currently don’t offer grip, but the way we like to describe the grip is the same grippyness one feels when they are playing basketball on an indoor wood court. The squeaky sensation that you get between your shoes and the gym floor is the same feeling you get when riding a Jelly. Also, the new Man O’ War Longboard has concave that help lock in your feet.
 
Q: Is it durable or will it break?
A: Polycarbonate is extremely durable and possesses high-impact strength all while being 100% recyclable under classification “7”. We offer a six-month warranty and will send another board if structural damage arises whether by a manufacturer’s defect or by personal use, no questions asked. 
 
Q: Does it scratch easy?
A: Yes, yes it does. Just like any skateboard out there, they will get scratched up. That’s just the nature of the sport.
 
BLOCK
 
Q: What is a riser BLOCK? 
A: A riser BLOCK is the most convenient way to add some innovation and style to your skateboard while also preventing wheel bite.
 
 
 
Q: What is wheel bite? 
A: Wheel bite is when the skateboard wheel makes contact with the bottom of the deck while turning sharply.  This contact causes the wheel to stop rolling and likely sends you to make contact with the pavement! 
 
Q: BLOCK risers are angled, what does that do? 
A: An angled BLOCK allows you to “wedge” or “de-wedge” your trucks; therefore changing the geometry of your trucks.
 
Q: Changing the geometry, what does that mean? 
A: When the geometry of the truck changes, it changes your turning radius.  If you wedge your trucks, you can increase the amount of rotation on the truck.  Therefore, you can turn in a smaller circle.
If you dewedge your trucks, it will give the board a less reactive feel.  Your turning will be less so it will take a larger area to turn in the same circle, and the skateboard will be more stable at higher speeds.
 
Q: What is a Standard-Kingpin or Reverse-Kingpin?
A: First off, the Kingpin is the center bolt that allows the axle to pivot side to side.
Standard-Kingpin Trucks are often found on beach cruisers, and street skateboards that have either one or two kick tails.  The center bolts on the trucks are on the inside of the skateboard.  Reference the Jelly KingSlayer.
Reverse-Kingpin Trucks are often seen on longboards and allow for greater turning ability and a lower profile setup.  The center bolt would be on the outside of skateboard.  Reference the Jelly Man O’ War.
 
 
Q: How is the Jelly Man O’War setup?
A: The Jelly Man O’War will come set-up dewedged to allow for the most stable ride possible.  This also provides a true front and rear view with your GoBLOCK.
 
 
Q: What is the difference between wedging and dewedging?
A: Wedging and dewedging are the same, no matter whether you have a Standard-Kingpin and Reverse-Kingpin truck(s): the fat side toward the center of the skateboard will “wedge” and make that truck turn more; the fat side toward the ends of the skateboard will “de-wedge” and make that truck turn less.

 Q: Should I wedge or dewedge? 
A: That will mostly depend on the style of riding you are doing as well as your personal preference. 
 
Q: Can’t I just tighten the kingpin? 
A: Tightening the kingpin only restricts the range of motion by slowing the turning action down and making it harder or easier to lean the board. Wedging (de-wedging) changes how much your board turns when you do lean it.   Use your wrench to adjust kingpin tension for fine-tuning after you've decided on wedging (or none) and the proper bushing is chosen.
 
Q: Proper bushing, is there going to be a test?
A: There will not be a test, but changing the hardness (durometer) of your bushing increases or decreases the turning response.  This is based on rider weight and personal preference.
 
Q: Do I have to wedge or dewedge? 
A: The short answer is no, the high tech skateboard trucks available today allow for some great turning abilities but sometimes they still cause wheel bite.  In this case BLOCK will soon offer both the BettyBOX and StandardBLOCK as a standard flat risers so you can still take advantage of the most innovative #*?# ever.

<p>The V4 is the most advanced pogo stick ever created. We took the traditional spring and threw it in the garbage years ago. Springs are cool and all, but they can’t be adjusted on the fly, and they're just too heavy to propel someone really high.</p>

The V4 is by far the most advanced pogo stick on the market. We've put a lot of attention into every single detail to make sure that it feels incredible right out of the box. <div>

<p><br/>It really is pretty simple. Start out at a low, comfortable pressure - gauges in the US always use psi to measure pressure. Start with 1/4 of what you weigh in pounds for your psi. After you get used to the air spring, you can pump more air into the V4. The more air you put into the V4 the stiffer the spring becomes. If you put too much, it'll become too stiff. At that point, you just press the button on top to release some air.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434128282/jjkmeypievsm8jqfsitx.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: left;""></p>
<br/><p>One of the best things about the V4 is that you can choose however you want to use it. Pump the V4 up with low pressure, and it will have a soft spring that limits your jump. If you pump it up a lot, the spring will stiffen and you can go higher. Pump it up with too much air, and the spring will become so hard it won’t budge until you let some air out. <strong>Try different air pressures to find your preferred setting!</strong></p>
<p>Any model can jump 1’ high, and any model can jump 8’ feet high.</p>
<p><strong>The V4 Pro</strong> can jump 10’ high and is much more comfortable at altitude. </p>
<p><strong>The V4</strong> is a good all around stick that can be geared for going high or just bouncing a foot or two. </p>
<p><strong>The V4 Fit</strong> is geared toward the fitness aspect only. While it can still bounce 8' high, it's not nearly as comfortable when doing so.</p>

<p>The V4 provides one of the most fun forms of full body exercise you’ll ever have. One of the coolest things about it is that it doesn't feel like exercise. You just hop on and bounce away - and before you know it, your heart is pounding and the sweat is pouring. According to neurosurgeon Dr. Kim Manwaring, the G forces experienced when bouncing on our pogo sticks help with “...lower circulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels, assist in the rehabilitation of a heart problem, promote tissue repair, improve balance, increase capacity for respiration and improve muscle-to-fat ratio.""
</p>
<p>The V4 Fit is a great for exercise. The shorter shaft makes it easier to step up onto, faster to learn, &amp; simpler control. As a low impact, high intensity exercise device, it’s suitable for HIIT (high intensity interval training), Crossfit and circuit training, and any other sort of training in which you are looking for a high heart rate and short bursts of energy expenditure.</p>

<p>The V4 uses an air spring to launch you into the air. If it isn’t cool enough that air alone can provide enough power to toss you 10’ high, then what about the fact that when you’re done using it you can just release the air and collapse the air spring?</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you let the air out, the shaft compresses inside of the stick for travel mode. Freaking awesome!</p>
<p>The medium V4 goes from 55"" in height during bounce mode to 34: in height during travel mode.</p>

<p>What a fantastic device. The high quality of materials and craftsmanship are obvious as soon as you open the box. I watched the tutorial, got it out of the box and took it outside. It’s been nearly 30 years since I have been on a pogo stick. Bouncing on the V4 Pro was amazing. It was just like being a kid again…onlyBIGGER and BETTTER!

<p>The V4 is for anyone over 75 pounds. You’d think that our only customers are younguns’ between 12 &amp; 20, but you’d be pretty surprised. A lot of our customers are actually full-grown adults in the mid-life crisis era of their lives who are trying to prove to themselves that they’re not that old. They say 60 is the new 40, right? :)</p>
<p>Really, our V4 can easily be used by pretty much anyone over 75 pounds that can jump on a trampoline. The V4 is a bit more difficult than a trampoline because you'll need to use more core strength and balance, but once you get used to it, the feeling is very similar...except it goes wherever you want it to.  </p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Safety is an area of huge concern for us. Our V4 is a lot safer than you might first believe. Many extreme sports are dangerous because of one element: speed. When moving at high rates of speed, it’s easy to get hurt. The V4 is actually deceptively safe because there’s no speed involved. Yes, you can jump really high on it…like <em>really freaking high.</em> BUT, it takes a lot of practice to get to that point - and even then you’re not attached to the pogo stick. If you ever feel uncomfortable, you can simply throw the pogo stick aside and land on your feet. We beefed up the V4 like a Belgian Blue Super Bull for that very reason - it's designed to take a beating so your body doesn't have to. </p>
<p>As is the case with any potentially dangerous activity, however, you should take this seriously. Wear a helmet and any other safety gear you feel might be necessary at all times. Don’t bounce in wet conditions. Don’t bounce indoors or under low objects. Don’t bounce next to traffic. Don’t bounce with people standing right next to you, blah, blah, blah. Use some common sense, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434499404/xwzti8xqux3ebvbqxgkj.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>USE IT (almost) ANYWHERE</strong></h3>
<p>Just like you, the V4 loves to be taken to new places. While most people will start out bouncing in front of their house, the real fun with the V4 comes when you start playing around with obstacles. Cities, schools, walls, rails, parks, tables, stairs, ledges - you’ll never look at the world the same way once you start bouncing around on obstacles. Jump off of things. Jump over things. Jump onto and then off of and then over things. Stalls and grinds and walls and lines. Every architectural feature around you has the potential to be jumped on or off of. </p>
<p>Places we don’t recommend are: hills or uneven surfaces, places that are wet or slippery, and environments that dusty and sandy (the dust will get sucked into the stick and cause the lubricant to get all dirty).</p>

<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
</div>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>PRODUCT QUESTIONS</strong></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>What is the difference between the V4 and the V4 Pro?</strong></p>
<p>
<b>The V4 </b>is the pogo stick that most people will probably benefit from. It is designed to deliver a soft, smooth bounce that resembles a portable trampoline. The major difference between our old V3 and the new V4 is that we’ve added 14 additional cubic inches of air to the cylinder. This additional air changes everything. With the V4, you can bounce higher with lower air pressure. This makes it easier to control, faster to learn, and easier to jump high &amp; do tricks. Aside from that, we’ve updated nearly every part on the pogo stick to fix nagging issues that have been troublesome in the past. The result is that the V4 is our newest and most amazing pogo stick. Just like Apple always says - this is the best “insert product here” we’ve ever made. In this case, however, the V4 really is by far the best pogo stick we’ve ever made.</p>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>The V4 Pro</strong> </span>takes all of the designs put into the V4 and then adds two new benefits. The V4 Pro has a slide shaft with a stroke that is 2” longer than the V4. This longer slide shaft provides extra boost for jumping even higher or landing from greater heights - like when you jump off of something tall. The V4 Pro also has a bushing with about 78% less surface area for less friction. On top of that, the bushing has pockets drilled into it that enable you to add your own lubricant. Once lubricant is added, the bushing will then self-lubricate the shaft while you bounce, providing an even smoother bounce. This bushing coupled with the longer slide shaft make the V4 ideal for serious riders or those looking to get the best we have to give. </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>The V4 Fit</strong> </span>is geared specifically for people interested in exercise and performance training. The V4 Fit has a 2"" shorter slide shaft stroke, which limits how high you can go. A fairly large number of our customers are people who grew up with a pogo stick and want to re-live their childhood glory days with a new age exercise tool. The V4 is a great fit for this because the shorter shaft makes it easier to step up onto, faster to learn, &amp; simpler control. As a low impact, high intensity exercise device, it’s suitable for HIIT training, Crossfit and circuit training, and any other sort of training in which you are looking for a high heart rate and short bursts of energy expenditure. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>What are the color options?</strong></p>
<p>The V4 comes in two different colors and three different sizes. The V4 is white. The V4 Pro will come in green. </p>
<div>
<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">What parts are most likely to break and need replacing?<br/></strong>The two parts that are most likely to wear down and break are the Grip Tip and the Handlebars. The Grip Tip takes a tremendous beating over its life and wears down like tread on tires. Over time you will need to replace it. The handlebars are designed to bend or break for safety reasons. In the event that you drop the pogo stick and it happens to land just right, the handlebars may bend, or after bending enough times, break. This is a safety feature designed into the pogo stick. You can purchase a new Grip Tip for $20 or Handlebars for $15. All other parts are covered under our warranty. <br/><b>  </b><br/><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Are the parts replaceable? Where can I get replacement parts?<br/></strong>Replacement parts are available on our website <a href=""http://www.vurtego.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vurtego.com</a>. All parts on the V4 can be quickly replaced at home without the need for sending the pogo stick in for repair.  </p>
<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is there an altimeter?<br/></strong>No altimeter on planet Earth can measure the ridiculous altitude's that the V4 is capable of reaching!</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is the temperature range that the V4 can be used it?<br/></b>The V4 is made from materials that can handle a wide range of temperatures. We have used the V4 in sub-zero temperatures, and it holds up just fine. Conversely, you can use the V4 when it is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or more outside. Our V4 can handle ranges from -50° to 225° Fahrenheit (-45° to 107° Celsius). If you happen to leave your pogo stick in the back of a car that's sitting in the middle of the Sahara Desert on a hot day, you <em>might </em>have some issues with some of the urethane parts beginning to distort. <br/>
<strong style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></strong><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">How high can I jump on the V4?</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>How high you can jump really depends on your own athletic ability. Can you dunk a basketball? If so, you'll probably be able to get on the V4 and fly...although it'll take practice before you're able to or even ready to jump high. If you're not very coordinated or athletic, you will have a much harder time jumping high than someone who is. With enough practice, just about everyone should be able to jump 5' or higher. The best of the best will be able to go 9'-10' once they get really, really good on it.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><strong>What are the dimensions and weight of each size?</strong></strong></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">

<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433488626/n3okwgafch0wggmfwuja.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What size should I get?</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Small - 4'8"" - 5'3"" (147cm - 161cm)</p>
<p>Medium - 5'4"" - 5'11"" (162cm - 181cm)</p>
<p>Large - 6' - 6'6"" (182cm - 198cm)</p>
<p>There are oftentimes cases where a youngster is a little too short to get the medium but will probably grow to be 5'4"" within six months. In those cases, it would be best to get the larger size and grow into it - but only if you will grow into it quickly. Jumping on a size that is too tall for you is more difficult than jumping on a pogo stick that is too short. If you are in between sizes, it's usually better to go smaller.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>I'm still growing. Should I get the next larger size if I'm going to be tall enough soon?</strong></p>
<div>If you're still growing and are close to the next size up, we recommend getting the larger size and growing into it. Bouncing on a pogo stick that is too tall is a bit difficult, but nobody wants to shell out $400 and grow out of it in 6 months. If you're more than 3-4"" away from the next size up, you should probably get the size that fits you now because the larger size will be too difficult to jump with.</div>
<strong>I’m right on the line between a small/medium or medium/large. Which size should I get?</strong>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you're done growing, it's generally better to go with the smaller size when you're right in between two sizes. If you are still growing, you will probably want to get a larger size. </span>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>Small - 4'8"" - 5'3"" (147cm - 161cm)</p>
<p>Medium - 5'4"" - 5'11"" (162cm - 181cm)</p>
<p>Large - 6' - 6'6"" (182cm - 198cm)</p>
<p>There are oftentimes cases where a youngster is a little too short to get the medium but will probably grow to be 5'6"" within six months. In those cases, it would be best to get the larger size and grow into it - but only if you will grow into it quickly. Jumping on a size that is too tall for you is more difficult than jumping on a pogo stick that is too short. If you are in between sizes, it's usually better to go smaller. If you're uncertain, we'll help you figure out which size to get.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><strong><strong>Can I jump higher on a bigger size?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>No. The size of the pogo stick does not determine the height that you can jump. The world record for height over a bar (10') was set on a Medium. Bigger sizes will not help you jump higher because you will have more difficulty centering your weight on top of the pogo stick. It's very important to be able to bend your upper body over the pogo stick so that you can not only achieve a balanced center of gravity but also push your weight into the bounce to create more lift. Get the size that fits your body best, and you'll be able to jump higher. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><strong>I'm still growing. Should I get the next larger size if I'm going to be tall enough soon?</strong></strong></p>
<p>If you're still growing and are close to the next size up, we recommend getting the larger size and growing into it...but only if you're close. Bouncing on a pogo stick that is too tall is a bit difficult, but nobody wants to shell out $400 and grow out of it in 6 months. If you're more than 3-4"" away from the next size up, you should probably get the size that fits you now because the larger size will be too difficult to jump with.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<strong>I'm planning on sharing this with my kids. What size should I get?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you're 6'3"" and your kids are 4'6"" you will have a very difficult time sharing sizes. Someone who is very tall can easily bounce on a medium but will have issues bouncing on a small. Similarly, kids that are 4'6"" will be able to bounce on a small but won't be able to use a medium. About 55% of all pogo sticks we've sold in the past are mediums, so that size is generally the best choice for sharing. It's usually a better idea to get the smaller size than the larger one when groups of people will be sharing. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>I’m under your 75 pound weight requirement. Is there any way I can still use it?</strong></p>
<p>We typically say that there’s a 75 pound limit because we are certain that at that weight anyone really is capable of bouncing. People under 75 pounds will need to have some athleticism and an understanding of timing to be able to use the V4. Someone who weighs 150 pounds doesn't feel much friction in the stick, but someone who weighs 60 pounds will. Because of that, they will need to really be able to time their bounces and jump at the right time in order to use it. Some people get this concept and others just don’t. Being able to jump on the V4 at less than 75 pounds is a case by case basis. We do not recommend people under 60 pounds using it because the pogo stick will be too heavy for them.</p>

<h3>USAGE
</h3></strong></strong>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>Do you need a helmet?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Yes. We recommend practicing safe bouncing at all times. </span></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">How do you pump it up?<br/></b>You can use a standard Schrader valve bike pump or air compressor to pump it up.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;background-color: initial;"">How long will the V4 hold air for?<br/></strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our V4 can hold air for several days to weeks at a time depending on how you use it.</span></p>
<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">How much air should I pump the V4 up to?</strong></p>
<p>We don't recommend using less than 30 psi because the lower the air pressure the easier it is for air to escape, meaning you may have to pump it up more often.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>How do you adjust the air spring for different people?</strong></p>
<p>The air spring is based on the psi that the V4 is pumped up to.  More air (higher psi) creates a stiffer spring. Less air (lower psi) creates a softer spring.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>We recommend starting with 1/4 of your body weight in pounds (1/2 in kilograms). If you weight 200 pounds, for example, you would want to start with around 50 psi in the V4. As you get  better and more comfortable, you can pump more air into the V4, which will stiffen the spring and let you jump higher.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>Does the V4 come with a pump?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Not currently. Standard pumps can be purchased for as little as $15 from a Target or Amazon.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>What are the weight requirements?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend a 75 pound weight limit on the lower end. There is no maximum weight limit. The V4 has a burst capacity of over 2,000 psi. This means that someone would need to pump 650 psi into the cylinder and then be able to fully compress it to put the cylinder in jeopardy...doing so would mean being able to jump onto buildings and just isn't possible with any human weight or strength - instead we recommend that customers gauge their own abilities. If you weigh 400 pounds the V4 can handle you...but can you handle it?</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<strong>What is the lowest psi you recommend using? What is the max psi?</strong></p>
<p>We don't recommend using less than 30 psi because the lower the air pressure the easier it is for air to escape, meaning you may have to pump it up more often if you only plan on using it at 25 psi.<br/></p>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>How does it collapse for transport mode?</strong></p>
<p>When you release the air from the V4, the shaft and Grip Tip collapse into the cylinder for easy transport. When you pump it up again, they pop right back out.</p>
<div>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>WHERE TO USE THE V4</strong></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>What different kinds of places can I bounce on the V4?</strong></p>
<p>You can use the V4 in a variety of places, but we recommend hard, dry surfaces like concrete. Our customers oftentimes take their pogo sticks to schools or similar places that skateboarders like to skate.</p>
<p><b>How does it handle different types of terrain?</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Where we're going, we don't need roads. The V4 can be used a different types of surfaces so long as they are hard and dry. Grass feels nice and soft to bounce in, but you risk the chance of putting holes all over the place...and if you hit a spot with wet dirt or mud you're going to put a hole in the ground. Many people who use our pogo sticks in their backyards like to jump on a sheet of plywood. Aside from concrete and grass you can bounce on wood floors, laminate, cement, asphalt and other surfaces that won't break or cause you to slip. You SHOULD NOT jump on anything that is wet or soft. Stay away from gravel, mud, sand, and really dirty environments. </span></p>
<p><b>Can I use the V4 at a skate park?</b></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Skate parks can be really fun on a V4, but you need to be aware of landing on angled surfaces like ramps. Doing so can result in slipping out and can be dangerous. If you do take the V4 to a skate park, do not jump onto any of the sttep ramps...instead, jump over them! Some skate parks allow pogo sticks, and some do not. It usually depends on who is monitoring the park.</p>
<p><strong>Can I bounce on hills?</strong><br/></p>
<div>
<p>We don't recommend bouncing on hills. Steep hills are a definite no no. Very, VERY mild hills are probably ok, but make sure you're very confident in your skills before trying to attempt bouncing on a hill.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<strong>Can I use the V4 for a commute?</strong>
</p>
<p>The V4 is a pretty difficult workout. Bouncing for more than a minute will have your heart beating like Dave Grohl on the drums. Because of that, the V4 is not an ideal commuting device. By the time you get to work or school you'd need to take a nap.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><strong>MAINTENANCE &amp; CARE</strong></strong></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>How often do I need to do maintenance?</strong></p>
<p>As you bounce on the V4 dirt and debris will get sucked into the cylinder, eventually gumming up the seal and slowing down the bounce. You might not notice the change as it gradually takes place, but after several thousand bounces it will become more difficult to jump. We have two types of maintenance that we perform. Adding lubricant will make the V4 nice and slippery again, but it won't clean up the dirt and debris in the cylinder. After adding lube a few times, it's best to clean the dirt up with a full oil change.</p>
<p><b>ADDING LUBE: </b>We recommend adding lubricant to your V4 about every 3,000-5,000 bounces. Doing so takes about 2 minutes and is really simple. </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">OIL CHANGES: </span>We recommend doing a full oil change every 4-5 times that you add lubricant or about every 15,000-20,000 bounces. Performing a full oil change takes approximately 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3><strong>PAYMENT &amp; SHIPPING</strong></h3></strong>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>Can I pick mine up locally?</strong></p>
<p>Yep. Our shop is located in Mission Viejo, CA. If you happen to live nearby and want to pick it up instead of paying for shipping, we'd love to meet you and help you get accustomed to your new V4!</p>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>Can I come by and check it out before I decide to buy?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, but we don’t have anyone who works full-time. You’ll probably have to come by on a weekend or on weeknights after work.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>Are there any countries you don’t ship to?</strong></p>
<p>We can ship anywhere in the world. <br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>What are the shipping times within the US?</strong></p>
<p>Shipping times in the US are anywhere from 1-2 days on the west coast to 5 days on the east coast.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>How long are international shipping times?</strong></p>
<p>International shipping times vary from country to country. Depending on your local customs inspection process, the shipping time can take anywhere from 7-14 days. Some countries have more slow customs processes and can even take up to 21 days. This is completely out of our control, as we cannot contact the customs office and ask them to speed it up - even though we'd love to do so!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>How much are import taxes and how will they be paid?</strong></p>
<p>Import taxes are charged on a country by country basis. Once your V4 clears customs, you will be contacted by your local postal carrier to pay for the customs fees prior to final delivery.</p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b><strong><br/></strong></b></strong></h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b><strong>COST &amp; MANUFACTURING</strong></b></strong></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>How is the V4 manufactured?</strong></p>
<p>Every single V4 we sell goes through a rigorous build, inspection, and testing process. Once the parts are manufactured in Southern California we ship them back to the warehouse where they are assembled by hand. We have more than 20 suppliers who we work closely with to manufacture or purchase parts from. Each of these manufacturers does a terrific job, which is why we are able to offer a 1-year warranty on the V4. Some of our parts (like the handlebar grips or bolts) are purchases from other companies. However, most of the parts we purchase are made specifically for us and then are welded, cut &amp; drilled, or chamfered before being delivered.</p>
<p><b>Who assembles them?<br/></b>We assemble every pogo stick ourselves. If we are not able to do so, we beg for help from friends and family. When we're really lucky, we're able to get a small group of local high school kids to help out for a few days, in which case we can build quite a few.</p>

<p>The V3 comes with a 1-year warranty on parts. The handlebars are excluded from the warranty because they are designed to give way in order to help prevent potential injuries. From time to time, people do break the handlebars, for which we sell a 3-pack replacement on our website for $20. We really do build our pogo sticks to a high standard. Every single stick is built by hand in our Southern California shop. We then inspect and bounce test each one prior to boxing and shipping them out. Because of that, our rejects are exceptionally low. Most issues that do occur in the lifetime of our sticks are pretty easily fixed with a phone call and maybe a small replacement part (o-ring). From time to time, we do have sticks out there that people can't repair on their own, which we'll repair for free within the warranty period.</p>

The V4 is the most advanced pogo stick ever created. We took the traditional spring and threw it in the garbage years ago. Springs are cool and all, but they can’t be adjusted on the fly, and they're just too heavy to propel someone really high.
In order to get more air, we needed to add air.V4 SPECS

The V4 is by far the most advanced pogo stick on the market. We've put a lot of attention into every single detail to make sure that it feels incredible right out of the box. 
ADD AIR TO CREATE A STIFFER SPRING
REMOVE AIR TO CREATE A SOFTER SPRING


It really is pretty simple. Start out at a low, comfortable pressure - gauges in the US always use psi to measure pressure. Start with 1/4 of what you weigh in pounds for your psi. After you get used to the air spring, you can pump more air into the V4. The more air you put into the V4 the stiffer the spring becomes. If you put too much, it'll become too stiff. At that point, you just press the button on top to release some air.




One of the best things about the V4 is that you can choose however you want to use it. Pump the V4 up with low pressure, and it will have a soft spring that limits your jump. If you pump it up a lot, the spring will stiffen and you can go higher. Pump it up with too much air, and the spring will become so hard it won’t budge until you let some air out. Try different air pressures to find your preferred setting!
Any model can jump 1’ high, and any model can jump 8’ feet high.
The V4 Pro can jump 10’ high and is much more comfortable at altitude. 
The V4 is a good all around stick that can be geared for going high or just bouncing a foot or two. 
The V4 Fit is geared toward the fitness aspect only. While it can still bounce 8' high, it's not nearly as comfortable when doing so.

EXERCISE


The V4 provides one of the most fun forms of full body exercise you’ll ever have. One of the coolest things about it is that it doesn't feel like exercise. You just hop on and bounce away - and before you know it, your heart is pounding and the sweat is pouring. According to neurosurgeon Dr. Kim Manwaring, the G forces experienced when bouncing on our pogo sticks help with “...lower circulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels, assist in the rehabilitation of a heart problem, promote tissue repair, improve balance, increase capacity for respiration and improve muscle-to-fat ratio.""

The V4 Fit is a great for exercise. The shorter shaft makes it easier to step up onto, faster to learn, & simpler control. As a low impact, high intensity exercise device, it’s suitable for HIIT (high intensity interval training), Crossfit and circuit training, and any other sort of training in which you are looking for a high heart rate and short bursts of energy expenditure.
MUSCLES WORKED: lower back, glutes, guads, hamstrings, calves, and triceps.   


EASILY RETRACTABLE FOR TRANSPORTATION


The V4 uses an air spring to launch you into the air. If it isn’t cool enough that air alone can provide enough power to toss you 10’ high, then what about the fact that when you’re done using it you can just release the air and collapse the air spring?

When you let the air out, the shaft compresses inside of the stick for travel mode. Freaking awesome!
The medium V4 goes from 55"" in height during bounce mode to 34: in height during travel mode.

New Indiegogo Customer Reviews (Check Our Comments Section)

What a fantastic device. The high quality of materials and craftsmanship are obvious as soon as you open the box. I watched the tutorial, got it out of the box and took it outside. It’s been nearly 30 years since I have been on a pogo stick. Bouncing on the V4 Pro was amazing. It was just like being a kid again…onlyBIGGER and BETTTER! If you’ve ever pogoed before, you’ll be getting some solid bounces on your Vurtego in no time.       - Brookes Bacon
Connor LOVES his V4 Pro. Here is his progress after only two days. http://youtu.be/W9N_5yHcvXA          - Shawn Humphreys







WHO'S IT FOR?


The V4 is for anyone over 75 pounds. You’d think that our only customers are younguns’ between 12 & 20, but you’d be pretty surprised. A lot of our customers are actually full-grown adults in the mid-life crisis era of their lives who are trying to prove to themselves that they’re not that old. They say 60 is the new 40, right? :)
Really, our V4 can easily be used by pretty much anyone over 75 pounds that can jump on a trampoline. The V4 is a bit more difficult than a trampoline because you'll need to use more core strength and balance, but once you get used to it, the feeling is very similar...except it goes wherever you want it to.  

The V4 is for you if:

You’re looking for a really fun, killer workout
You’re a crazy kid who wants to push the limits
You like extreme sports
You like dogs
You've always dreamed of flying
You think the hoverboard from Back to the Future should be here already
You like cats…cuz cats are better than dogs
Just kidding, dogs are better
You've always want to be able to dunk a basketball
You think parkour is pretty cool and want to try it for yourself
Psyche! Cats are totally better

SAFETY






Safety is an area of huge concern for us. Our V4 is a lot safer than you might first believe. Many extreme sports are dangerous because of one element: speed. When moving at high rates of speed, it’s easy to get hurt. The V4 is actually deceptively safe because there’s no speed involved. Yes, you can jump really high on it…like really freaking high. BUT, it takes a lot of practice to get to that point - and even then you’re not attached to the pogo stick. If you ever feel uncomfortable, you can simply throw the pogo stick aside and land on your feet. We beefed up the V4 like a Belgian Blue Super Bull for that very reason - it's designed to take a beating so your body doesn't have to. 
As is the case with any potentially dangerous activity, however, you should take this seriously. Wear a helmet and any other safety gear you feel might be necessary at all times. Don’t bounce in wet conditions. Don’t bounce indoors or under low objects. Don’t bounce next to traffic. Don’t bounce with people standing right next to you, blah, blah, blah. Use some common sense, and you’ll be fine.




USE IT (almost) ANYWHERE
Just like you, the V4 loves to be taken to new places. While most people will start out bouncing in front of their house, the real fun with the V4 comes when you start playing around with obstacles. Cities, schools, walls, rails, parks, tables, stairs, ledges - you’ll never look at the world the same way once you start bouncing around on obstacles. Jump off of things. Jump over things. Jump onto and then off of and then over things. Stalls and grinds and walls and lines. Every architectural feature around you has the potential to be jumped on or off of. 
Places we don’t recommend are: hills or uneven surfaces, places that are wet or slippery, and environments that dusty and sandy (the dust will get sucked into the stick and cause the lubricant to get all dirty).

FAQ

PRODUCT QUESTIONS
What is the difference between the V4 and the V4 Pro?

The V4 is the pogo stick that most people will probably benefit from. It is designed to deliver a soft, smooth bounce that resembles a portable trampoline. The major difference between our old V3 and the new V4 is that we’ve added 14 additional cubic inches of air to the cylinder. This additional air changes everything. With the V4, you can bounce higher with lower air pressure. This makes it easier to control, faster to learn, and easier to jump high & do tricks. Aside from that, we’ve updated nearly every part on the pogo stick to fix nagging issues that have been troublesome in the past. The result is that the V4 is our newest and most amazing pogo stick. Just like Apple always says - this is the best “insert product here” we’ve ever made. In this case, however, the V4 really is by far the best pogo stick we’ve ever made.

The V4 Pro takes all of the designs put into the V4 and then adds two new benefits. The V4 Pro has a slide shaft with a stroke that is 2” longer than the V4. This longer slide shaft provides extra boost for jumping even higher or landing from greater heights - like when you jump off of something tall. The V4 Pro also has a bushing with about 78% less surface area for less friction. On top of that, the bushing has pockets drilled into it that enable you to add your own lubricant. Once lubricant is added, the bushing will then self-lubricate the shaft while you bounce, providing an even smoother bounce. This bushing coupled with the longer slide shaft make the V4 ideal for serious riders or those looking to get the best we have to give. 
The V4 Fit is geared specifically for people interested in exercise and performance training. The V4 Fit has a 2"" shorter slide shaft stroke, which limits how high you can go. A fairly large number of our customers are people who grew up with a pogo stick and want to re-live their childhood glory days with a new age exercise tool. The V4 is a great fit for this because the shorter shaft makes it easier to step up onto, faster to learn, & simpler control. As a low impact, high intensity exercise device, it’s suitable for HIIT training, Crossfit and circuit training, and any other sort of training in which you are looking for a high heart rate and short bursts of energy expenditure. 
What are the color options?
The V4 comes in two different colors and three different sizes. The V4 is white. The V4 Pro will come in green. 

What parts are most likely to break and need replacing?The two parts that are most likely to wear down and break are the Grip Tip and the Handlebars. The Grip Tip takes a tremendous beating over its life and wears down like tread on tires. Over time you will need to replace it. The handlebars are designed to bend or break for safety reasons. In the event that you drop the pogo stick and it happens to land just right, the handlebars may bend, or after bending enough times, break. This is a safety feature designed into the pogo stick. You can purchase a new Grip Tip for $20 or Handlebars for $15. All other parts are covered under our warranty.   Are the parts replaceable? Where can I get replacement parts?Replacement parts are available on our website www.vurtego.com. All parts on the V4 can be quickly replaced at home without the need for sending the pogo stick in for repair.  
Is there an altimeter?No altimeter on planet Earth can measure the ridiculous altitude's that the V4 is capable of reaching!
What is the temperature range that the V4 can be used it?The V4 is made from materials that can handle a wide range of temperatures. We have used the V4 in sub-zero temperatures, and it holds up just fine. Conversely, you can use the V4 when it is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or more outside. Our V4 can handle ranges from -50° to 225° Fahrenheit (-45° to 107° Celsius). If you happen to leave your pogo stick in the back of a car that's sitting in the middle of the Sahara Desert on a hot day, you might have some issues with some of the urethane parts beginning to distort. 
How high can I jump on the V4?






How high you can jump really depends on your own athletic ability. Can you dunk a basketball? If so, you'll probably be able to get on the V4 and fly...although it'll take practice before you're able to or even ready to jump high. If you're not very coordinated or athletic, you will have a much harder time jumping high than someone who is. With enough practice, just about everyone should be able to jump 5' or higher. The best of the best will be able to go 9'-10' once they get really, really good on it.



Does it come with streamers?

Only for the most serious riders.


SIZES
What are the dimensions and weight of each size?






What size should I get?

Small - 4'8"" - 5'3"" (147cm - 161cm)
Medium - 5'4"" - 5'11"" (162cm - 181cm)
Large - 6' - 6'6"" (182cm - 198cm)
There are oftentimes cases where a youngster is a little too short to get the medium but will probably grow to be 5'4"" within six months. In those cases, it would be best to get the larger size and grow into it - but only if you will grow into it quickly. Jumping on a size that is too tall for you is more difficult than jumping on a pogo stick that is too short. If you are in between sizes, it's usually better to go smaller.

I'm still growing. Should I get the next larger size if I'm going to be tall enough soon?
If you're still growing and are close to the next size up, we recommend getting the larger size and growing into it. Bouncing on a pogo stick that is too tall is a bit difficult, but nobody wants to shell out $400 and grow out of it in 6 months. If you're more than 3-4"" away from the next size up, you should probably get the size that fits you now because the larger size will be too difficult to jump with.
I’m right on the line between a small/medium or medium/large. Which size should I get?


If you're done growing, it's generally better to go with the smaller size when you're right in between two sizes. If you are still growing, you will probably want to get a larger size. 



Small - 4'8"" - 5'3"" (147cm - 161cm)
Medium - 5'4"" - 5'11"" (162cm - 181cm)
Large - 6' - 6'6"" (182cm - 198cm)
There are oftentimes cases where a youngster is a little too short to get the medium but will probably grow to be 5'6"" within six months. In those cases, it would be best to get the larger size and grow into it - but only if you will grow into it quickly. Jumping on a size that is too tall for you is more difficult than jumping on a pogo stick that is too short. If you are in between sizes, it's usually better to go smaller. If you're uncertain, we'll help you figure out which size to get.

Can I jump higher on a bigger size?
No. The size of the pogo stick does not determine the height that you can jump. The world record for height over a bar (10') was set on a Medium. Bigger sizes will not help you jump higher because you will have more difficulty centering your weight on top of the pogo stick. It's very important to be able to bend your upper body over the pogo stick so that you can not only achieve a balanced center of gravity but also push your weight into the bounce to create more lift. Get the size that fits your body best, and you'll be able to jump higher. 
I'm still growing. Should I get the next larger size if I'm going to be tall enough soon?
If you're still growing and are close to the next size up, we recommend getting the larger size and growing into it...but only if you're close. Bouncing on a pogo stick that is too tall is a bit difficult, but nobody wants to shell out $400 and grow out of it in 6 months. If you're more than 3-4"" away from the next size up, you should probably get the size that fits you now because the larger size will be too difficult to jump with.





I'm planning on sharing this with my kids. What size should I get?

If you're 6'3"" and your kids are 4'6"" you will have a very difficult time sharing sizes. Someone who is very tall can easily bounce on a medium but will have issues bouncing on a small. Similarly, kids that are 4'6"" will be able to bounce on a small but won't be able to use a medium. About 55% of all pogo sticks we've sold in the past are mediums, so that size is generally the best choice for sharing. It's usually a better idea to get the smaller size than the larger one when groups of people will be sharing. 
I’m under your 75 pound weight requirement. Is there any way I can still use it?
We typically say that there’s a 75 pound limit because we are certain that at that weight anyone really is capable of bouncing. People under 75 pounds will need to have some athleticism and an understanding of timing to be able to use the V4. Someone who weighs 150 pounds doesn't feel much friction in the stick, but someone who weighs 60 pounds will. Because of that, they will need to really be able to time their bounces and jump at the right time in order to use it. Some people get this concept and others just don’t. Being able to jump on the V4 at less than 75 pounds is a case by case basis. We do not recommend people under 60 pounds using it because the pogo stick will be too heavy for them.




USAGE

Do you need a helmet?
Yes. We recommend practicing safe bouncing at all times. 
How do you pump it up?You can use a standard Schrader valve bike pump or air compressor to pump it up.
How long will the V4 hold air for?Our V4 can hold air for several days to weeks at a time depending on how you use it.
How much air should I pump the V4 up to?
We don't recommend using less than 30 psi because the lower the air pressure the easier it is for air to escape, meaning you may have to pump it up more often.



How do you adjust the air spring for different people?
The air spring is based on the psi that the V4 is pumped up to.  More air (higher psi) creates a stiffer spring. Less air (lower psi) creates a softer spring.


We recommend starting with 1/4 of your body weight in pounds (1/2 in kilograms). If you weight 200 pounds, for example, you would want to start with around 50 psi in the V4. As you get  better and more comfortable, you can pump more air into the V4, which will stiffen the spring and let you jump higher.
Does the V4 come with a pump?

Not currently. Standard pumps can be purchased for as little as $15 from a Target or Amazon.
What are the weight requirements?
We recommend a 75 pound weight limit on the lower end. There is no maximum weight limit. The V4 has a burst capacity of over 2,000 psi. This means that someone would need to pump 650 psi into the cylinder and then be able to fully compress it to put the cylinder in jeopardy...doing so would mean being able to jump onto buildings and just isn't possible with any human weight or strength - instead we recommend that customers gauge their own abilities. If you weigh 400 pounds the V4 can handle you...but can you handle it?

What is the lowest psi you recommend using? What is the max psi?
We don't recommend using less than 30 psi because the lower the air pressure the easier it is for air to escape, meaning you may have to pump it up more often if you only plan on using it at 25 psi.

How does it collapse for transport mode?
When you release the air from the V4, the shaft and Grip Tip collapse into the cylinder for easy transport. When you pump it up again, they pop right back out.


WHERE TO USE THE V4
What different kinds of places can I bounce on the V4?
You can use the V4 in a variety of places, but we recommend hard, dry surfaces like concrete. Our customers oftentimes take their pogo sticks to schools or similar places that skateboarders like to skate.
How does it handle different types of terrain?
Where we're going, we don't need roads. The V4 can be used a different types of surfaces so long as they are hard and dry. Grass feels nice and soft to bounce in, but you risk the chance of putting holes all over the place...and if you hit a spot with wet dirt or mud you're going to put a hole in the ground. Many people who use our pogo sticks in their backyards like to jump on a sheet of plywood. Aside from concrete and grass you can bounce on wood floors, laminate, cement, asphalt and other surfaces that won't break or cause you to slip. You SHOULD NOT jump on anything that is wet or soft. Stay away from gravel, mud, sand, and really dirty environments. 
Can I use the V4 at a skate park?


Skate parks can be really fun on a V4, but you need to be aware of landing on angled surfaces like ramps. Doing so can result in slipping out and can be dangerous. If you do take the V4 to a skate park, do not jump onto any of the sttep ramps...instead, jump over them! Some skate parks allow pogo sticks, and some do not. It usually depends on who is monitoring the park.
Can I bounce on hills?

We don't recommend bouncing on hills. Steep hills are a definite no no. Very, VERY mild hills are probably ok, but make sure you're very confident in your skills before trying to attempt bouncing on a hill.


Can I use the V4 for a commute?

The V4 is a pretty difficult workout. Bouncing for more than a minute will have your heart beating like Dave Grohl on the drums. Because of that, the V4 is not an ideal commuting device. By the time you get to work or school you'd need to take a nap.




MAINTENANCE & CARE
How often do I need to do maintenance?
As you bounce on the V4 dirt and debris will get sucked into the cylinder, eventually gumming up the seal and slowing down the bounce. You might not notice the change as it gradually takes place, but after several thousand bounces it will become more difficult to jump. We have two types of maintenance that we perform. Adding lubricant will make the V4 nice and slippery again, but it won't clean up the dirt and debris in the cylinder. After adding lube a few times, it's best to clean the dirt up with a full oil change.
ADDING LUBE: We recommend adding lubricant to your V4 about every 3,000-5,000 bounces. Doing so takes about 2 minutes and is really simple. 
OIL CHANGES: We recommend doing a full oil change every 4-5 times that you add lubricant or about every 15,000-20,000 bounces. Performing a full oil change takes approximately 10-15 minutes.


PAYMENT & SHIPPING
Can I pick mine up locally?
Yep. Our shop is located in Mission Viejo, CA. If you happen to live nearby and want to pick it up instead of paying for shipping, we'd love to meet you and help you get accustomed to your new V4!




Can I come by and check it out before I decide to buy?
Yep, but we don’t have anyone who works full-time. You’ll probably have to come by on a weekend or on weeknights after work.

Are there any countries you don’t ship to?
We can ship anywhere in the world. 




What are the shipping times within the US?
Shipping times in the US are anywhere from 1-2 days on the west coast to 5 days on the east coast.
How long are international shipping times?
International shipping times vary from country to country. Depending on your local customs inspection process, the shipping time can take anywhere from 7-14 days. Some countries have more slow customs processes and can even take up to 21 days. This is completely out of our control, as we cannot contact the customs office and ask them to speed it up - even though we'd love to do so!
How much are import taxes and how will they be paid?
Import taxes are charged on a country by country basis. Once your V4 clears customs, you will be contacted by your local postal carrier to pay for the customs fees prior to final delivery.




COST & MANUFACTURING
How is the V4 manufactured?
Every single V4 we sell goes through a rigorous build, inspection, and testing process. Once the parts are manufactured in Southern California we ship them back to the warehouse where they are assembled by hand. We have more than 20 suppliers who we work closely with to manufacture or purchase parts from. Each of these manufacturers does a terrific job, which is why we are able to offer a 1-year warranty on the V4. Some of our parts (like the handlebar grips or bolts) are purchases from other companies. However, most of the parts we purchase are made specifically for us and then are welded, cut & drilled, or chamfered before being delivered.
Who assembles them?We assemble every pogo stick ourselves. If we are not able to do so, we beg for help from friends and family. When we're really lucky, we're able to get a small group of local high school kids to help out for a few days, in which case we can build quite a few.


 




WARRANTY & SUPPORT
What is the warranty?
The V3 comes with a 1-year warranty on parts. The handlebars are excluded from the warranty because they are designed to give way in order to help prevent potential injuries. From time to time, people do break the handlebars, for which we sell a 3-pack replacement on our website for $20. We really do build our pogo sticks to a high standard. Every single stick is built by hand in our Southern California shop. We then inspect and bounce test each one prior to boxing and shipping them out. Because of that, our rejects are exceptionally low. Most issues that do occur in the lifetime of our sticks are pretty easily fixed with a phone call and maybe a small replacement part (o-ring). From time to time, we do have sticks out there that people can't repair on their own, which we'll repair for free within the warranty period.
Can I get a refund?
According to Indiegogo, contributions are non-refundable in their Terms of Use. However, upon the completion of the campaign, we will confirm your shipping address and your order to perform refunds on a case by case basis. We get it, sometimes life happens. Keep in mind that we can't perform refunds until the campaign is complete.

Will there be a network of retailers carrying the V4?
As of right now, there is no network of retailers carrying the V4. This will likely change over the next couple years.",17.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","THE HOPE LINE is an around-the-clock multiple service for elderly people and for
people with disabilities, which includes medical alarm services, information and medical call-center, network of a social care workers and psychological
services. The Hope Line service will be available
all over Ukraine. Our company provides the services and care elderly people and
at-risk groups need and can rely on to live more fulfilled lives all over
Ukraine.HOW IT WORKS?
Each
of our users will have an emergency wireless transmitter (pendant or wristband with SOS
button) and a base station, which has a very sensitive microphone and a loudspeaker. With just one
press of a special SOS button our system will guarantee access to essential aid
and support, providing vital care to those who need it most. Elderly people
will be able to call for help, obtain the necessary information from the call
center operator and consult a physician with one press of their personal SOS
button. When we receive a distress call, a social worker will be sent immediately to deliver any necessary medication or goods, open the door for emergency services or give first aid if necessary. WHY DO WE DO THIS?
There are over
thirteen million elderly citizens in Ukraine and more than eight million people
with disabilities. Some have no immediate family or their relatives live far
away. So there is no one who can help them in their daily life or in
a case of emergency. The state healthcare and social welfare systems in
Ukraine cannot provide proper care for such people yet.
There are often no medical centers in villages and small cities of Ukraine where elderly people
could consult a doctor and get medical help. Elderly people have a lot of
questions that they do not know who to ask. So they just stay alone with their
problems.

The Hope
Line will solve those problems. 

OUR GOAL.To fully realise
the true potential of The Hope Line, we need to raise further investment. Our basic $10,000 goal will

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Kerri, wife and mother, yoga teacher and doula.  After having my daughter, Iris, I went through a tough time of great anxiety and deep depression. While I did hear of postpartum depression, I didn't understand it completely and minimized my perceived risk. However, I was clearly at risk. I had been diagnosed with clinical depression in the past and during the early part of my pregnancy I had, what I now know, was antenatal depression. </p>
<p>Now, I know that I am not alone. 1 in 7 women suffer with perinatal mood disorders (including depression, anxiety, bipolar, OCD, PTSD, and a small group with psychosis).  Some are dying.</p>
<p>Having postpartum depression and anxiety was like sitting in a dragons mouth - one move and it would swallow me. It was a paralyzing and lonely experience. Eventually, with time and yoga, I was able to break through some of that isolation and find a more peaceful outlook on motherhood and life. This was also with support of friends and family.</p>
<p>Some women need more including mental health counseling and/or medication.  Every mom is different, but I believe every mom could benefit from yoga and mindfulness instruction and at the very least, as safe, supportive community. </p>
<p>This is what I want to build and about a year ago I introduced Out of the Blue Yoga for this purpose. The first year, I was able to reach around 70 prenatal and postnatal moms with yoga. I want to do more. My husband, Isaac, works multiple jobs to support my dream of building Out of the Blue Yoga. <strong>The purchase of Yoga Harbor gives me the space to legitimize Out of the Blue Yoga and more flexibility to DO more and HELP more moms find their way out of the blue. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money raised in this campaign will help us with the creation of the right space for families in the Clearwater-Largo community at our newly purchased, Yoga Harbor studio. Out of the Blue Yoga is a program within the studio. While classes are held for the entire community, we wish to build special moms room to provide services such as mindfulness classes, support groups, private prenatal and postpartum class, mother roasting services, massage, and doula consultation. Our main yoga room will provide group prenatal and mommy and me yoga classes as well as space for child birth classes, prenatal yoga instructor trainings, and birth/parent- related work shops. </p>
<p>Your gift will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>the buildout of the moms room and adding amenities for the comforts of moms and babies</li>
<li>re-painting, re-furnishing, and redesigning the lobby, moms room, and yoga room.</li>
<li>setting up added security to create the safest space possible</li>
<li>floor cleaning</li>
<li>purchase and install of new signage</li>
<li>enhancing the front porch and grounds surrounding the studio</li>
<li>assisting with buy-in cost of business</li>
<li>Any extra funds will go towards marketing expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perks!</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the amount your gift will get you services and products offered by myself and the studio, including yoga instruction, massage, t-shirts, and more.</p>If we do not make that goal, we will push on with less and put the donations towards the most needed expenses. <br/> </div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to offer moms a support system and community.  Often what is lacking is support and understanding of the difficulties of adjusting to motherhood. 1 in 7 go through it, many more are silent. I want to offer moms tools and options, so no one feels like they have none. I want to build a bridge (with yoga, essentially) between that mom and any other professional help she may need by continuing to build relationships with resources in the Tampa Bay area. </p>
<p>Research and studies are starting to show the benefits of yoga to pregnant and new mothers in terms of reduction of physical pain, stress levels, and anxiety.  I believe we can have the same results.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.ctcpjournal.com/article/S1744-3881(15)00025-0/fulltext?cc=y="" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ctcpjournal.com/article/S1744-3881(1...</a> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge is financial support. I have enjoyed building connections in this community and will continue to form more. I also have a great business partner, Melissa, whom supports my vision for Out of the Blue Yoga.

<h3>Cancer has been a part of our lives for so long, I don't remember anything else.</h3>
Hello my dear friends. That's a picture of my Mom and I last year around this time. My Name is Wayne Colig. I am the youngest of two Boys born to Patricia Colig (Patty) and my Dad - Miro Colig, who died when I was 15 years old. My older Brother (of 2 years) Sean, lives quite far away in Vancouver.</div>
<div>I'm 34 Years old and and I have been taking care of my Mom for many years. I was 11 when My Mom and Dad first sat us down and explained that my Mom had Cancer, Stage 3 Cervical to be specific. At this point the Tumor was the size of a Orange. . I can't remember how I felt, I was so young and confused. But all I do remember thinking was ""What would I ever do without her?"".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She immediately had 32 Radiation treatments in Vancouver B.C, and I didn't miss a single treatment with her. Every day at 4pm the volunteer drivers would pick us up and take us on the long cummute from Burnaby to the Cancer Care Agency of British Columbia (CCABC). I was so scared and confused, I just wanted her to get through this. I remembered when they kept her in the hospital towards the end of her treatments - thinking I would never see her again and having a feeling of complete emptiness. Shortly after she completed her treatment, minor complications started not too long after. Although nothing serious enough to cause alarm.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was one and a half years later in 1991 when my Family started falling apart. My parents seprarted and eventually I made the very hard decision to leave with my Mother and come back to Ontario, where we were from originally to start a new life. My Brother Sean, stayed with my Dad. I was - crushed and what was to come was possibly the worst thing that has ever happened to us. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It wasn't long after we moved back to Ontario in 1992 that the Cancer had returned, She immediately became a patient of the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre, Now called the Jurvinski Cancer Centre and Hospital because of the most gracious donations made by Margaret and Charles Jurvinski, two amazing Canadian philanthropists.  She has been going to this hospital now for 21 years. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Tumor had returned and it was aggresive she was given the option for 15 more Radiation treatments, for a grand total of 47. If we had known back then what this treatment would evetually do, I wonder if she would have looked into alternative routes? Sometimes the suffering caused from the treatment itself, though it does save lives, makes me wonder if buying time is worth the pain that is sure to hit you in the future. It breaks my heart. :(</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Even though everything looked good, there was an evil lurking in my Mother that wanted to pick a fight with her over and over.... I hate this Disease!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1993 went by with little problems into 1994, when one day on June 16, 1994, we had received a phone call that My Dad had been in an accident and was in a Coma. He was still in B.C and my Mother had no Money to get us out there to see him. The next 5 days were excrutiating. If it wasn't for one Man:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Brad Rossin: Director of Marketing for Canada 3000 Airlines. ""If you are out there, Thank you!""</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>This man is an Angel, and if anyone reading this knows who this may be, please pass the message on that I am eternally grateful for his gracious generosity and help. Bless his heart.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How my Mother was able to get a hold of Corporate is beyond me, But this Man got us on a Plane to Vanouver free of charge. It was a blessing, because no sooner did we land and get to The Royal Columbian Hospital in New Wesminster - My Dad had just passed away. We didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A piece of me died with him that day. I don't think I ever really recovered.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My Mom's Cancer returned in 1995 and after Chemo Cream, Chemotherapy and Laser to remove the diseased tissue, they finally decided to perform a Radical Hysterectomy. Even without a Uterus or Cervix, the Cancer just didn't want to give up and it decided to try again, but it was caught in time and killed with more lazer and Chemo Cream. I remember my Mother's Oncologist, Dr. Francois Moens stating once that it was a battle-ground in there. the next 10 years were calm but always stressfull. It was after 2005 that things started on a downward spiral.......</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My freinds. I could probably write a Book. With 24 years of watching my Mother go through this day after day, month after month and year after year and Medical file nearly 10 thousand pages split into several binders......The conditions are endless. The Journey - exhausting. I wouldn't wish it upon any Woman. Or anybody for that matter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's the past 5 years that have been the hardest. The Radiation that saved  my Mother is now killing her. She is literally falling apart and rotting from the inside out. It's graphic. Her Bladder has literally disintegrated and everything in the plevic area is one gigantic hole. She lost her ability to use the restroom and now has a Colostomy and Nephrostomy tubes. She can barely walk these days and she is in constant agonizing pain.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wish I could help her when she is in pain but the best I can do is give her her medications, make her a nice meal, make her laugh, watch a movie, run the household and make things as normal as possible, as abnormal as we all feel.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But then there is the hardest part. Just recently tests have discovered on an MRI that she has extensive Tumor, as they put it -  in the Pelvic Area. She didn't want to hear it. She ran out of the room. They told me it's about making her comfortable now. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To add insult to injury, we just lost our precious little Girl, our Cat Maggie of 16 years to Breast Cancer less than two weeks ago, which has compounded and filled us with so much more grief.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> I have been a walking wreck. This thought, the constant thought of her not being with me one day is the hardest thing I have endured since losing my Dad. The thought of being alone scares me so badly. I have been so dependant upon my Mother over these years and she upon me. I have hope. But because of all of this. I have lost my Job because her care was more important to me. My Grandmother (Mum's Side) past away of Cancer in 2008 and  My Grandfather of Cancer is 2011. We have very little family left besides my Mother's Aunts, Eleanor and Marilyn who have been very wonderful in emotional support this past year. And my Mom's Sister, My Aunt Diane. Her support is minimal as she is dealing with some very difficult situations herself these days. Although the love is there, asking anyone for finanial support is just out of the question. Besides that, very little support from immediate family because there really isn't any left.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My Car, the one thing I depend upon to get my Mom to all of her appointments in Hamilton and Toronto is starting to fall apart and I can't afford to get the repairs needed. Her life insurance was cancelled because of default payments due to the fact that her Medical Supply expenses are so costly that we were left with nothing. No body will insure her now. And going back to work is not an option for me, which is just dreadful.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just want, if ""it"" does happen, for my Mother to have a little diginity in death. To be sure that everything will be taken care of. She deserves that at least.  I pray everyday for a miracle. But seeing that she has had absolutely no quality of life for the past 2 years and practically has not left the house in a whole year while watching her get worse every month makes me believe that her battle is wearing her thin, Although I KNOW that she has a whole lot more fight in her. I'm so proud of her. And in retrospect, I wouldn't trade it for anything. Every moment of heartache, pain, suffering, poverty and loss. I wouldn't trade her if I was offered the Universe </div>
<div> </div>
<div>She is the best part of me. And when it's her time, Most of me will have gone with her. God help us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for listening my freinds and thank you for your kind consideration, Your generosity and your kindness, We will be forvever in your debt. And you will forever be a part of our lives.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>With all the strength and love I could possibly spare.</div>

<h2>What my Mom Needs. </h2>
<p>Our vehicle is in need of nearly 4 Thousand dollars in repairs. I need to ensure that I have a working safe ride for her to make the treks to the Hamilton Jurivinski and Princess Margaret Hospitals in Toronto, which round trip are in the hundreds of Km's. </p>
<p>Our vehicle is 9 years old and I have not always had the financial ability to keep the repairs up to date. I'm afraid of not being able to drive it at all soon. It's not sounding good at all these past few Months.</p>
<p>To clear My Mother's debts and ensure that Medical supplies will not be a hardship in the future and in these difficult times. With me not working, any extra will be a blessing. With her debts and and supplies, An extra 4 Thousand would ensure less worry and more focus on fighting to live.</p>
<p>The most imprtant thing and the part that I cry about every night as I try to sleep is not being able to pay for a proper funeral for My Mother. Funerals can run upwards of $10,000 dollars these days and we just don't have anything like that. This scares me the most. I haven't slept in 2 months since the most recent diagnosis. I have frightening visions of her being put in a plywood box and and not being able to ensure a proper service for her. I feel terrible that I have not been on top of this from the beginning, but truth be told - I always believed that she would be with me for a lot longer than this. And I never imagined that things would be this bad this fast.</p>
<p>My Brother Sean. He is really the only family I will have left. And All I want is for him to get out here to see and spend some time with me and Mom. But 4000km separating us and his financial situation is making this impossible. My Mom needs him more than ever right now and I want to bring him home to Ontario to stay with us for a while. Our family is not complete without him.</p>
<p>My Mom has never ever been on a real vacation and one thing she has always wanted to do was go away somewhere. She loves David Letterman, so I thought about taking her to see a show, but she has always talked about seeing Venice. I know Venice would more than likely be too hard on her, so New York City and Letterman would be a dream come true for her.</p>
<p>You can help make this happen. </p>
<p>Please. Please help us.</p>

</h3></div>","Cancer has been a part of our lives for so long, I don't remember anything else.
Hello my dear friends. That's a picture of my Mom and I last year around this time. My Name is Wayne Colig. I am the youngest of two Boys born to Patricia Colig (Patty) and my Dad - Miro Colig, who died when I was 15 years old. My older Brother (of 2 years) Sean, lives quite far away in Vancouver.
I'm 34 Years old and and I have been taking care of my Mom for many years. I was 11 when My Mom and Dad first sat us down and explained that my Mom had Cancer, Stage 3 Cervical to be specific. At this point the Tumor was the size of a Orange. . I can't remember how I felt, I was so young and confused. But all I do remember thinking was ""What would I ever do without her?"".
 
She immediately had 32 Radiation treatments in Vancouver B.C, and I didn't miss a single treatment with her. Every day at 4pm the volunteer drivers would pick us up and take us on the long cummute from Burnaby to the Cancer Care Agency of British Columbia (CCABC). I was so scared and confused, I just wanted her to get through this. I remembered when they kept her in the hospital towards the end of her treatments - thinking I would never see her again and having a feeling of complete emptiness. Shortly after she completed her treatment, minor complications started not too long after. Although nothing serious enough to cause alarm.
 
It was one and a half years later in 1991 when my Family started falling apart. My parents seprarted and eventually I made the very hard decision to leave with my Mother and come back to Ontario, where we were from originally to start a new life. My Brother Sean, stayed with my Dad. I was - crushed and what was to come was possibly the worst thing that has ever happened to us. 
 
It wasn't long after we moved back to Ontario in 1992 that the Cancer had returned, She immediately became a patient of the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre, Now called the Jurvinski Cancer Centre and Hospital because of the most gracious donations made by Margaret and Charles Jurvinski, two amazing Canadian philanthropists.  She has been going to this hospital now for 21 years. 
 
The Tumor had returned and it was aggresive she was given the option for 15 more Radiation treatments, for a grand total of 47. If we had known back then what this treatment would evetually do, I wonder if she would have looked into alternative routes? Sometimes the suffering caused from the treatment itself, though it does save lives, makes me wonder if buying time is worth the pain that is sure to hit you in the future. It breaks my heart. :(
 
Even though everything looked good, there was an evil lurking in my Mother that wanted to pick a fight with her over and over.... I hate this Disease!
 
1993 went by with little problems into 1994, when one day on June 16, 1994, we had received a phone call that My Dad had been in an accident and was in a Coma. He was still in B.C and my Mother had no Money to get us out there to see him. The next 5 days were excrutiating. If it wasn't for one Man:
 
Brad Rossin: Director of Marketing for Canada 3000 Airlines. ""If you are out there, Thank you!""
 
This man is an Angel, and if anyone reading this knows who this may be, please pass the message on that I am eternally grateful for his gracious generosity and help. Bless his heart.
 
How my Mother was able to get a hold of Corporate is beyond me, But this Man got us on a Plane to Vanouver free of charge. It was a blessing, because no sooner did we land and get to The Royal Columbian Hospital in New Wesminster - My Dad had just passed away. We didn't even have a chance to say goodbye.
 
A piece of me died with him that day. I don't think I ever really recovered.
 
My Mom's Cancer returned in 1995 and after Chemo Cream, Chemotherapy and Laser to remove the diseased tissue, they finally decided to perform a Radical Hysterectomy. Even without a Uterus or Cervix, the Cancer just didn't want to give up and it decided to try again, but it was caught in time and killed with more lazer and Chemo Cream. I remember my Mother's Oncologist, Dr. Francois Moens stating once that it was a battle-ground in there. the next 10 years were calm but always stressfull. It was after 2005 that things started on a downward spiral.......
 
My freinds. I could probably write a Book. With 24 years of watching my Mother go through this day after day, month after month and year after year and Medical file nearly 10 thousand pages split into several binders......The conditions are endless. The Journey - exhausting. I wouldn't wish it upon any Woman. Or anybody for that matter.
 
It's the past 5 years that have been the hardest. The Radiation that saved  my Mother is now killing her. She is literally falling apart and rotting from the inside out. It's graphic. Her Bladder has literally disintegrated and everything in the plevic area is one gigantic hole. She lost her ability to use the restroom and now has a Colostomy and Nephrostomy tubes. She can barely walk these days and she is in constant agonizing pain.
 
I wish I could help her when she is in pain but the best I can do is give her her medications, make her a nice meal, make her laugh, watch a movie, run the household and make things as normal as possible, as abnormal as we all feel.
 
But then there is the hardest part. Just recently tests have discovered on an MRI that she has extensive Tumor, as they put it -  in the Pelvic Area. She didn't want to hear it. She ran out of the room. They told me it's about making her comfortable now. 
 
To add insult to injury, we just lost our precious little Girl, our Cat Maggie of 16 years to Breast Cancer less than two weeks ago, which has compounded and filled us with so much more grief.
 
 I have been a walking wreck. This thought, the constant thought of her not being with me one day is the hardest thing I have endured since losing my Dad. The thought of being alone scares me so badly. I have been so dependant upon my Mother over these years and she upon me. I have hope. But because of all of this. I have lost my Job because her care was more important to me. My Grandmother (Mum's Side) past away of Cancer in 2008 and  My Grandfather of Cancer is 2011. We have very little family left besides my Mother's Aunts, Eleanor and Marilyn who have been very wonderful in emotional support this past year. And my Mom's Sister, My Aunt Diane. Her support is minimal as she is dealing with some very difficult situations herself these days. Although the love is there, asking anyone for finanial support is just out of the question. Besides that, very little support from immediate family because there really isn't any left.
 
My Car, the one thing I depend upon to get my Mom to all of her appointments in Hamilton and Toronto is starting to fall apart and I can't afford to get the repairs needed. Her life insurance was cancelled because of default payments due to the fact that her Medical Supply expenses are so costly that we were left with nothing. No body will insure her now. And going back to work is not an option for me, which is just dreadful.
 
I just want, if ""it"" does happen, for my Mother to have a little diginity in death. To be sure that everything will be taken care of. She deserves that at least.  I pray everyday for a miracle. But seeing that she has had absolutely no quality of life for the past 2 years and practically has not left the house in a whole year while watching her get worse every month makes me believe that her battle is wearing her thin, Although I KNOW that she has a whole lot more fight in her. I'm so proud of her. And in retrospect, I wouldn't trade it for anything. Every moment of heartache, pain, suffering, poverty and loss. I wouldn't trade her if I was offered the Universe 
 
She is the best part of me. And when it's her time, Most of me will have gone with her. God help us.
 
Thank you for listening my freinds and thank you for your kind consideration, Your generosity and your kindness, We will be forvever in your debt. And you will forever be a part of our lives.
 
 
With all the strength and love I could possibly spare.
 
Sincerely

<h3>Help us bring our Dad home</h3>
<p>Roberto Alveo, missionary and pastor for over 30 years throughout Panamá, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, friend of many, and always remembered as someone who constantly was helping and serving others. Last year, on July 4th, 2012, just one day before returning home to Houston, Texas from visiting family in Panamá, our dad had a massive stroke that has left him paralyzed due to the brain damage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What this money will cover</h3>
<div>Our goal is to raise $9,000 to bring our dad home where he will have a better opportunity to recover alongside his children and grandchildren. With this money, we will contract Medical Life Flight, to transport our dad from Panama to Houston, TX. This is the cost of his flight and the transportation for the medical and technical personnel who will monitor his vitals, administer any medications, and will assure his safe return home. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>$9,000 is just the base cost to cover his flight home. Any other monies collected will go towards his medical expenses, therapies and equipment needed to make his daily routine easier. Every small amount counts and is much appreciated. All donors will receive monthly updates on his progress.</div>

<p><strong>Who We Are and What We're Trying to Do</strong></p>
<p>Safe Gun Technology is developing unique gun safety technology using biometric fingerprint recognition to prevent unauthorized users from firing your gun. No this is not out of a spy movie, this is very real. Bottom line, SGTi technology will reduce gun violence across the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Pitch in today, and help Fund Safe Guns! </strong></p>
<p>Safe Gun Technology, Inc. (SGTi), was founded in Columbus, Georgia by a group of individuals from all walks of life, who are dedicated to making guns safer and reducing gun violence through technology. In 2008, we successfully built a functioning prototype with SGTi technology. The original prototype was built by retrofitting SGTi technology on to a Remington 870 shotgun, but now, we need your help to develop a market ready prototype of SGTi technology on an assault style rifle.</p>
<p><strong>SGTi Technology</strong></p>
<p>SGTi is developing proprietary technology that is fully self-contained requiring no external devices. SGTi technology includes mechanisms which, if tampered with, would render the firearm useless.  SGTi’s goal is to make this technology functional on all types of firearms ranging from an AR-15 to a 1911 handgun.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $50,000 to retrofit a gun and build a market ready prototype of SGTi technology on an assault style rifle.  Any money raised will be solely dedicated to our engineering team who are experts in the field.  The SGTi engineering team will then use the money on the research and development, and refinement of the market ready prototype.</p>
<p>SGTi backers will have the option of receiving a perk reward as a gesture of our sincere gratitude and appreciation. Perk rewards include recognition as a supporter on the SGTi website (you can remain anonymous if you want to), subscription to the SGTi e-newsletter, SGTi-branded bumper stickers, notepads &amp; pens, t-shirt &amp; polo shirts, as well as exclusive access to the latest SGTi product demos and advance notification of SGTi product launches.</p>
<p><strong>Our Passion and Determination</strong></p>
<p>Moved by the tragedy at Columbine 14 years ago, Kenneth Collins, a construction worker and resident of Phenix City, Alabama, was determined to follow through and turn his prior gun safety ideas into action. With some assistance, he developed a ""smart"" gun technology system for firearms. Ken filed his patent on April 22, 1999, just two days after the Columbine  tragedy.</p>
<p>An avid gun owner, Ken has been trying to develop viable gun safety technology for the past 15 years. Along the way, he's brought a team of dedicated people from diverse backgrounds on board who all share his desire to improve gun safety. What started as one person in the late '90s has now become an unprecedented social enterprise intent on making a positive impact.</p>
<p>We believe that there are many other people across the country just like Ken.  People who support and respect the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms but who also believe that this right comes with a responsibility.  People who are sickened every time an innocent human being is killed as a result of a senseless gun tragedy.  </p>
<p>These are the words we live by: ""If we save the life of one child then it is a miracle to that child and to everyone whose life is touched by that child.""</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE PITCH IN TODAY TO HELP MAKE GUNS SAFER! WITH YOUR COLLECTIVE HELP, SGTi WILL BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE MARKET ENTRY OF OUR PROPRIETARY GUN SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. </strong></p>
<p>If you support what we are doing but are unable to contribute at this time, you can still help us by spreading the word about our campaign.  Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools. </p>

Safe Gun Technology is developing unique gun safety technology using biometric fingerprint recognition to prevent unauthorized users from firing your gun. No this is not out of a spy movie, this is very real. Bottom line, SGTi technology will reduce gun violence across the United States.
Pitch in today, and help Fund Safe Guns! 
Safe Gun Technology, Inc. (SGTi), was founded in Columbus, Georgia by a group of individuals from all walks of life, who are dedicated to making guns safer and reducing gun violence through technology. In 2008, we successfully built a functioning prototype with SGTi technology. The original prototype was built by retrofitting SGTi technology on to a Remington 870 shotgun, but now, we need your help to develop a market ready prototype of SGTi technology on an assault style rifle.
SGTi Technology
SGTi is developing proprietary technology that is fully self-contained requiring no external devices. SGTi technology includes mechanisms which, if tampered with, would render the firearm useless.  SGTi’s goal is to make this technology functional on all types of firearms ranging from an AR-15 to a 1911 handgun.
What We Need
We need to raise $50,000 to retrofit a gun and build a market ready prototype of SGTi technology on an assault style rifle.  Any money raised will be solely dedicated to our engineering team who are experts in the field.  The SGTi engineering team will then use the money on the research and development, and refinement of the market ready prototype.
SGTi backers will have the option of receiving a perk reward as a gesture of our sincere gratitude and appreciation. Perk rewards include recognition as a supporter on the SGTi website (you can remain anonymous if you want to), subscription to the SGTi e-newsletter, SGTi-branded bumper stickers, notepads & pens, t-shirt & polo shirts, as well as exclusive access to the latest SGTi product demos and advance notification of SGTi product launches.
Our Passion and Determination
Moved by the tragedy at Columbine 14 years ago, Kenneth Collins, a construction worker and resident of Phenix City, Alabama, was determined to follow through and turn his prior gun safety ideas into action. With some assistance, he developed a ""smart"" gun technology system for firearms. Ken filed his patent on April 22, 1999, just two days after the Columbine  tragedy.
An avid gun owner, Ken has been trying to develop viable gun safety technology for the past 15 years. Along the way, he's brought a team of dedicated people from diverse backgrounds on board who all share his desire to improve gun safety. What started as one person in the late '90s has now become an unprecedented social enterprise intent on making a positive impact.
We believe that there are many other people across the country just like Ken.  People who support and respect the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms but who also believe that this right comes with a responsibility.  People who are sickened every time an innocent human being is killed as a result of a senseless gun tragedy.  
These are the words we live by: ""If we save the life of one child then it is a miracle to that child and to everyone whose life is touched by that child.""
PLEASE PITCH IN TODAY TO HELP MAKE GUNS SAFER! WITH YOUR COLLECTIVE HELP, SGTi WILL BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE MARKET ENTRY OF OUR PROPRIETARY GUN SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. 
If you support what we are doing but are unable to contribute at this time, you can still help us by spreading the word about our campaign.  Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools.

much plastic! One of the most obvious impacts of plastic bottles is what
happens after the water has been consumed. Considering that approximately        <b>60 million plastic water bottles are used every day in the US</b>, we can assume

Since our first release, November 2013, we have been on a roll and all from an airbnb garage, thanks to Anne and Dave! After a sell-out event and equipped
with a pre-order list from all over the world and great customer feedback, we
returned to R&amp;D. In September 2014, MOBOT officially launched in the USA with a positive response from a wide array of businesses and
athlete’s from sports including: surfing, rugby, volleyball, soccer,
SUP, water polo, golf, gymnastics as well as chiropractors, trainers,
first responders and military, flight attendants, dancers, schools and
more! MOBOT has a unique characteristic in that it is not industry, age or
gender specific. We are really excited to share MOBOT with you.</div>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q.
How do I use my Mobot?</p>
<p>A.
For in-depth instructions on the best way to use your MOBOT check out our MOBOT
blog. But if you want the short answer: sip some water, close the lid tight,
lie on top of your MOBOT, and start rolling out your body parts. We recommend
your legs, upper back, arms, hips, and glutes. We do NOT recommend rolling on
your head, lower back, or trying to stand on your MOBOT.</p>
<p>Q.
Does It hurt to roll?</p>
<p>A.
It all depends on your threshold for pain. We wouldn't say rolling tickles, but
no pain, no gain right? Pressure is necessary for the MOBOT to do its job. If
you're new to rolling, just adjust your pressure and build up slowly. Nothing
worth doing is ever easy in the beginning, but trust us — it will not only get
better, it will get great. You will start to experience changes all over your
body and before you know it, you'll be downright craving a roll (and not the
kind that comes with dinner).</p>
<p>Q.
How often and long should I roll?</p>
<p>A.
Our MOBOT blog has great tips for how to roll, but we believe you should roll
every day for around 5-15 minutes. If you're an athlete, have injuries or other
specific needs, or are just unsure, please ask your health care professional
about tailoring a program specifically for you.</p>
<p>Q.
Is the Mobot big enough for me?</p>
<p>A.
Yes. It might seem too good to be true, but all of our MOBOTs are adaptable to
human bodies of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Q.
I already have a foam roller, why should I get a Mobot?</p>
<p>A.
Foam rollers are great, but can your foam roller also deliver hydration (the
other crucial component to recovery) while fitting conveniently into your
purse, gym bag, or man satchel?</p>
<p>Q.
How do I clean my Mobot?</p>
<p>A.
Like most other sports water bottles, a MOBOT has a wide mouth to make cleaning
super easy. We recommend a small bottle brush and a good old-fashioned solution
of diluted vinegar or water with a bit of baking soda.</p>
<p>Q. Can
I use other beverages in my Mobot?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A.
Of course. Although water is our fave and we recommend you always use your
MOBOT for hydrating first, thanks to the high quality, food-grade stainless
steel, you can put juices, shakes, or even booze (heyo!) in your MOBOT. Just
make sure you clean it thoroughly afterwards and do NOT roll under the
influence.</p>
<p>Q.
Can I put my Mobot in the freezer?</p>
<p>A.
Please don't put your MOBOT in the freezer. Liquids expand when they freeze,
which could deform or break your MOBOT. Freezing damage is not covered by the
one-year warranty. If you like your drink cold, add ice.</p>
<p>Q.
Can I microwave it?</p>
<p>A.
Dear God, no! Never put anything metal in the microwave.</p>
<p>Q.
Can I put it in the dishwasher?</p>
<p>A.
No. When you need to clean, we recommend scrubbing out the inside with a bottle
brush and patting down the outside with a wet towel. You can soak your lids if
extra TLC is needed.</p>
<p>Q.
Is the foam removeable?</p>
<p>A.
No. One of the standout qualities of a MOBOT is that our foam is heat-pressed
directly onto the steel, guaranteeing better performance and insulation.</p>
<p>Q.
How much does my Mobot weigh?</p>
<p>A.
A 40oz/1.2 L MOBOT weighs just under 2lbs when full. A 18oz/0.5 L MOBOT weighs
just under 1lbs when full— but if you're staying hydrated, it’s never full for
too long!</p>
<p>Q.
How much weight can my Mobot hold?</p>
<p>A.
We've successfully tested up to 300+ Lbs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Q.
Will it rust?</p>
<p>A.
Nope. If you see any discoloration, just give your MOBOT a good clean with a
bottle brush. If you have more questions, let us know at support@mobotnation.com.</p>
<p>Q.
What if it dents?</p>
<p>A.
MOBOTs are constructed of heavy-gauge #304 (18/8) stainless steel that has
outperformed all other bottles in independent tests. BUT if you whale your
MOBOT into the ground, a dent is possible. So like anything you own and care
about, treat it nicely. Your one-year warranty covers manufacturer's defects
only, not damage caused by use. If you do happen to dent your MOBOT, the bottle
is still perfectly safe to use and will nearly always be functional unless it's
one big-a$$ dent, and that we would like to see!</p>
<p>Q.
Where is my Mobot made?</p>
<p>A.
Our company is based in Venice, CA, and our MOBOTs are handcrafted in Taiwan.
All our factories are ISO approved. We pride ourselves on having the highest
standards in the industry when it comes to quality, materials, and happy,
healthy team members — no matter where in the world, they are MOBOT family. We
visit all our locations regularly to make sure these standards are not only
being met, but exceeded.</p>
<p>Q.
Will it wear out?</p>
<p>A.
MOBOTs are made to last a long, looooong time and endure an incredible amount
of use. But if you're really rolling like a rock star your MOBOT could lose a
bit of its original luster. In this case we recommend you do your body a favor
and get yourself another one!</p>

The World's First Foam Roller Water Bottle
A Blend Of Hydration And Innovation. MOBOT is an
eco-friendly reusable foam roller water bottle, designed to help reduce
plastic waste and provide a healthier, more convenient way to stay hydrated.
H2O - Water Is Life
Simply put, most people don't take in enough water
on a day-to-day basis. Over time, failure to drink enough water can
contribute to a wide array of medical complications, from fatigue, joint pain
and weight gain to headaches, ulcers, high blood pressure and kidney disease. On the flip side, water can clear your skin, boost energy and improve mood.
You Are Designed To Feel Good
The human body was meant to move around. Long
periods of inactivity can lead to serious health issues and limit range of motion.
Let's face it, society is busier and more exhausted than ever, it’s time for a
more convenient, healthier solution. 




It's Your World








Too
much plastic! One of the most obvious impacts of plastic bottles is what
happens after the water has been consumed. Considering that approximately        60 million plastic water bottles are used every day in the US, we can assume
that nearly 18,834,000,000 end up in landfills each year. Each bottle can
take up to 700 years to decompose. Where does it end?




A Solution To Benefit All



MOBOT 
The
concept and design behind MOBOT, was to create products that help counter
the effects of a busy, active lifestyle. Our mission is to keep you moving and hydrated, while helping reduce the negative impacts of plastic bottles on your health and the environment.  MOBOT's are made of recycled, FDA-approved stainless steel and designed to be endlessly reusable and extremely durable. Each MOBOT purchased will result in less plastic and
less waste. Together we can help the planet.



A Simple Reminder





Bring
it with you. The MOBOT is one toteable tool. No longer bound to the gym or
therapists office, a massage session and a refreshing sip of
water can be accessed virtually anywhere. Keeping the MOBOT by your side will
serve as a constant reminder to stay hydrated and keep your body nourished. Travel Karma!


                     


Rolling

Foam Rolling is a cure-all for many different aches. It can help improve posture and relaxation, increase circulation, lengthen and loosen muscles, relieve joint pain, break down knots and increase range of motion. The grooves on the MOBOT act as fingers and provide a deeper massage geared towards releasing trigger points.


"" I didn't know I was tight until I tried the Mobot, now if I am rolling anyone can roll."" - love Mum, 60 years young!



A Product For Everyone

Athletes

The MOBOT serves as the perfect compliment for any athlete. It's great for both pre and post workout and will help you combat
those sore muscles after intense training sessions or while on the road, allowing for quicker
recovery and increased performance come game day. 

Roll On Any Job





Whether you are on your feet or sit all day at work, we've
got you covered. Bring your MOBOT with you and give your body a quick massage
every few hours during your break. Keep it by your desk to help remind you to
DRINK MORE WATER!! 


Children


Kids absolutely love the MOBOT.  With colors that really capture their attention, they want to stay hydrated and healthy. Make hydration one less thing to nag about. You're welcome!

Lifestyle 


The MOBOT promotes an active, mindful lifestyle.  Its
unique and sleek design creates an avenue for health, wellness and convenience
to come together in one aesthetically pleasing package.

Since our first release, November 2013, we have been on a roll and all from an airbnb garage, thanks to Anne and Dave! After a sell-out event and equipped
with a pre-order list from all over the world and great customer feedback, we
returned to R&D. In September 2014, MOBOT officially launched in the USA with a positive response from a wide array of businesses and
athlete’s from sports including: surfing, rugby, volleyball, soccer,
SUP, water polo, golf, gymnastics as well as chiropractors, trainers,
first responders and military, flight attendants, dancers, schools and
more! MOBOT has a unique characteristic in that it is not industry, age or
gender specific. We are really excited to share MOBOT with you.

Though, I’m certain that if your goal isn’t to put on tons of muscle, but rather to tone your body and make it more defined. The ObiToner can most definitely act as your primary source of working out.</p><p>For me, the ObiToner has had an incredible impact on my body. This is due to the fact that I was always using it whenever I was on the computer, bingeing a season of Breaking Bad, or even just waiting for some eggs to boil. Since it strapped to my waist, I’d take it all around the house during my daily routine. Hence, I was always periodically using it, sometimes without even realizing it. Seriously, it’s the most effective yet effortless workout tool I’ve ever used.  </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/380/390/797178d31e53e4e0a4c5b23623d7521f_original.png?v=1440562847&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=b586b29f4e99b01c132f592de407f5a9"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>I created the ObiToner with the intention to change the way people view working out. In today’s day and age, there is so much to do, see and experience. You can receive breaking world news, see updates on how your friends are doing, read the latest books, view breathtaking pictures, watch videos on nearly any topic and play any kind of game you can imagine, all while wearing pajamas and sitting on the couch. So, why shouldn’t you be able to workout as well?</p><p>My desire is to make people realize that getting and keeping in shape can be easier than they’ve ever previously thought. And that it doesn’t require an exorbitant amount of time and effort to accomplish, but rather they can get fit while doing anything else they’d normally be doing. </p><p>I’m so dedicated to that desire, that I took a gap year and saved up all the money I made working, in order to manufacture the first 1000 ObiToners. <b>Meaning that if you are one of the first 1000 backers you </b><i><b>will</b></i><b> be receiving yours around the time of estimated delivery.</b> If you are not one of the first 1000, then it will take a month longer to get it to you. I know one of the most frustrating things is to back a project and not receive what you were promised. So be rest assured, I’ve got your back (and so will the ObiToner when it arrives). I’m on Kickstarter because I need your support to take the ObiToner further. I want to get it into the hands of even more people, to raise awareness that there is a new, and easy solution to working out and to help everyone, everywhere who is struggling to get fit.</p><p>Please consider backing the ObiToner! </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/385/857/4288d60b652e8577cafb0322924874a8_original.png?v=1440630123&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=0f2fe98c0815c2dd1e134f411758f8c7"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p><i>               Here is a sample of 15 exercises that are possible with the ObiToner.</i></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/405/366/43ffd2ec21ca9b7bd9d5e8a51604f679_original.png?v=1440915072&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=aad6b51e2fa6192bd3f3f94128aec3f1"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>By the time the ObiTone ships our website will be up and running.

With the ObiToner you can always get a good workout in, anytime and anywhere.People of all fitness levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced):Whether you are thinking about joining a gym or have already been working out for a long time, the ObiToner is the perfect device for you.This video details how the ObiToner helped transform my life:Those with limited mobility (injured, paralyzed, disabled, etc.):






Sculpt your upper body - The ObiToner is the only thing you need to give your entire upper body a great workout. You can perform over 50 exercises with it! 

Take it wherever you're going - The ObiToner weighs only four pounds, and comes with it’s own pouch. It’s super easy to take it anywhere you want to go. 

Great back support - The ObiToner supports your back while working out and makes you feel good. It’s hard not to have amazing posture when it’s on. 

Get fit anytime - The ObiToner is designed to be used in settings where people normally don’t think they can work out (on the couch, in bed, in the kitchen, etc.).
 Note: The ObiToner fits up to waist size 40. Past that it may not comfortably fit when strapped to your waist. Although, you'll still be able to do many different exercises with it (via sitting or stepping on the belt).The ObiToner is a patent pending, comprehensive workout belt that allows you to tone your entire upper body. The belt utilizes resistant band technology to help you build muscle and shed fat.The resistant bands make use of your body weight while the belt simultaneously supports your back and tones your stomach. On each side of the ObiToner there are five clip-on slots which allow you to adjust the part of the belt that the resistance bands clip-on to. This will enable you to attach the bands to the locations on the ObiToner where they feel the most resistant.On each resistant band there are 3 notches you can use to adjust the length of the band, in order to better fit your arm length or to perform a specific exercise that requires the band to be either longer or shorter.The ObiToner can be used in various positions ranging from:
Standing up with it strapped to your waist 
Standing up while you step on it 
Sitting down with it strapped to your waist 
Sitting on it 
Sitting down while you step on it 
Laying down with it strapped to your waist 
Laying down on it 
 Due to the many ways the ObiToner can be used, there are over 50 exercises you can preform with it. Check out the “Possible exercises” section below.My results have been a combination of using the ObiToner on daily basis as well as going to the gym 1-2 days a week. The ObiToner can act as a gym replacement, however I found great usage in it being more of a supplement for me. Though, I’m certain that if your goal isn’t to put on tons of muscle, but rather to tone your body and make it more defined. The ObiToner can most definitely act as your primary source of working out.For me, the ObiToner has had an incredible impact on my body. This is due to the fact that I was always using it whenever I was on the computer, bingeing a season of Breaking Bad, or even just waiting for some eggs to boil. Since it strapped to my waist, I’d take it all around the house during my daily routine. Hence, I was always periodically using it, sometimes without even realizing it. Seriously, it’s the most effective yet effortless workout tool I’ve ever used.  I created the ObiToner with the intention to change the way people view working out. In today’s day and age, there is so much to do, see and experience. You can receive breaking world news, see updates on how your friends are doing, read the latest books, view breathtaking pictures, watch videos on nearly any topic and play any kind of game you can imagine, all while wearing pajamas and sitting on the couch. So, why shouldn’t you be able to workout as well?My desire is to make people realize that getting and keeping in shape can be easier than they’ve ever previously thought. And that it doesn’t require an exorbitant amount of time and effort to accomplish, but rather they can get fit while doing anything else they’d normally be doing. I’m so dedicated to that desire, that I took a gap year and saved up all the money I made working, in order to manufacture the first 1000 ObiToners. Meaning that if you are one of the first 1000 backers you will be receiving yours around the time of estimated delivery. If you are not one of the first 1000, then it will take a month longer to get it to you. I know one of the most frustrating things is to back a project and not receive what you were promised. So be rest assured, I’ve got your back (and so will the ObiToner when it arrives). I’m on Kickstarter because I need your support to take the ObiToner further. I want to get it into the hands of even more people, to raise awareness that there is a new, and easy solution to working out and to help everyone, everywhere who is struggling to get fit.Please consider backing the ObiToner!                Here is a sample of 15 exercises that are possible with the ObiToner.By the time the ObiTone ships our website will be up and running. Our site will have detailed instruction videos available to educate backers on how to perform the numerous exercises possible with the ObiToner.Don’t forget, once you receive your ObiToner and start using it consistently. You’ll begin to start acquiring amazing physical rewards, better health and a toned body!We began to work on the ObiToner back in 2013. We received a provisional patent, and recently applied for it's non-provisional patent, which is currently pending. This is what the belt looked like when we first started:  Here are a few of the comprehensive sketches we sent to our manufacturer in China, in order to create the various prototypes: Another material we used in the creation of the belt. In addition to, a few more sketches:  It took a long time and many different iterations: But, now it's finally here:",23.0,3,"1 Campaign

Each one of us is different, but together we create one entity. Our goal from the beginning was very clear - to create a product that is both simple in use but complex in its purpose and benefits. This is how our journey really began:</p><p>Piotr, after working for years as a physiotherapist, created his first brand – Physioroll. He launched a production of eco-friendly training accessories produced in Poland. He observed both regular people as well as professional athletes and encountered many modern day problems and disabilities caused by stress, too many responsibilities, a stationary lifestyle and lack of time to regenerate. Piotr took into account these problems and came up with the idea to create something that is therapeutic, but portable and easy at the same time. He brought together a trusted group of specialists from different fields and together, looking for a cure and answer, they came up with the concept of Layzzzy – the only mat that not only has therapeutic values, but is also 100% recyclable.</p><p>Born from a shared passion to create something unique, from experience, from countless meetings, discussions, smiles, little arguments, big arguments, lots and lots of take out, and most importantly from the belief that it is worth to do things that you enjoy and invest in those things- it is good to be together, but even better to be Layzzzy together!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608033012/cgu9oweekylmgp4hemrh.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608033044/kqzhryfwwkx28wxuoage.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608033069/wx791xzhwo1bqoqeikeg.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608033085/egcl5ichhqzfkphefuvb.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Risks and challenges</p><p>Unlike most Indiegogo projects, we've been working on Layzzzy for a year prior to the launch of this campaign. That means, there are still risks and challenges. Tax or handling fees: Layzzzy will not collect taxes or extra fees from our supporters. We will take precautions in ensuring the shipping items meet the targeted local policies, but the backer is responsible for any duties, handling fees, and/or VAT/GST/Sales tax. As the regulations vary from country to country, we advise customers to reach out to their local customs office for information about the duties and fees to be expected. Products: You should be aware, that there is a risk, that yellow dots mat could not meet our quality requirement after final production. In that case we provide you with basic mat in black colour. In addition, we would like to inform, that the shape of the spikes of our prototype (visible on the video and photos) may be little differ from the final product. * If you have any serious medical condition or disease, we recommend you consult your physician before using this product. The information provided is not intended to prevent, diagnose or treat any medical condition or disease. The information and advice given on the campaign is not intended to replace the services of a physician or a health care professional acting under a physician’s supervision, nor does it constitute a doctor-patient relationship. Warning: Before using Layzzzy consult your doctor if you have at least one of the following diseases or states - oncology; coagulation problems (haemophilia) or using anti-coagulants; epilepsy; substantial skin damage (severe eczema or psoriasis, singes) in the areas of use; pregnancy; fever or an acute illness; heart diseases; severe forms of various diseases; thrombophlebitis. Using Layzzzy does not cancel medical treatment.</p></div>","Our mission is to inspire people to care about their health through discovering their bodies.

Then link them with the Layzzzy Mini that you use for point pressure.        ...and this is how our mat is created. Working on the form in progress ! Introduce ourselvesWe are a group of balanced and healthy lifestyle enthusiasts. Each one of us is different, but together we create one entity. Our goal from the beginning was very clear - to create a product that is both simple in use but complex in its purpose and benefits. This is how our journey really began:Piotr, after working for years as a physiotherapist, created his first brand – Physioroll. He launched a production of eco-friendly training accessories produced in Poland. He observed both regular people as well as professional athletes and encountered many modern day problems and disabilities caused by stress, too many responsibilities, a stationary lifestyle and lack of time to regenerate. Piotr took into account these problems and came up with the idea to create something that is therapeutic, but portable and easy at the same time. He brought together a trusted group of specialists from different fields and together, looking for a cure and answer, they came up with the concept of Layzzzy – the only mat that not only has therapeutic values, but is also 100% recyclable.Born from a shared passion to create something unique, from experience, from countless meetings, discussions, smiles, little arguments, big arguments, lots and lots of take out, and most importantly from the belief that it is worth to do things that you enjoy and invest in those things- it is good to be together, but even better to be Layzzzy together!   Risks and challengesUnlike most Indiegogo projects, we've been working on Layzzzy for a year prior to the launch of this campaign. That means, there are still risks and challenges. Tax or handling fees: Layzzzy will not collect taxes or extra fees from our supporters. We will take precautions in ensuring the shipping items meet the targeted local policies, but the backer is responsible for any duties, handling fees, and/or VAT/GST/Sales tax. As the regulations vary from country to country, we advise customers to reach out to their local customs office for information about the duties and fees to be expected. Products: You should be aware, that there is a risk, that yellow dots mat could not meet our quality requirement after final production. In that case we provide you with basic mat in black colour. In addition, we would like to inform, that the shape of the spikes of our prototype (visible on the video and photos) may be little differ from the final product. * If you have any serious medical condition or disease, we recommend you consult your physician before using this product. The information provided is not intended to prevent, diagnose or treat any medical condition or disease. The information and advice given on the campaign is not intended to replace the services of a physician or a health care professional acting under a physician’s supervision, nor does it constitute a doctor-patient relationship. Warning: Before using Layzzzy consult your doctor if you have at least one of the following diseases or states - oncology; coagulation problems (haemophilia) or using anti-coagulants; epilepsy; substantial skin damage (severe eczema or psoriasis, singes) in the areas of use; pregnancy; fever or an acute illness; heart diseases; severe forms of various diseases; thrombophlebitis. Using Layzzzy does not cancel medical treatment.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The iCamPRO FHD employs a high-speed CPU to encode 256-bit encryption, encipher Full HD video, track moving objects, conduct two-way audio, deliver picture alerts, upload recorded video, etc</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It communicates with multiple sensors and compares picture frames one-by-one to detect the slightest movement in real time. This is not an easy task as iCamPRO is taking Full HD picture in each frame and grid each frame in many small blocks to compare their changes. .</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">iCamPRO’s multiple sensors are always on, and these sensors work together to continuously feed information to its CPU. They are like scouts detecting heat signature even in the dark!!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Traditional security devices' CPUs run at 100 MHz to 200 MHz because they use simple encryption, which does not require a big computation power. For some IP cameras employing a 56-bit encryption, it takes only 399 seconds to hack, which is less than 7 minutes. For 256-bit encryption, it may take a life time to break. Moreover, conventional IP cameras are unlikely to be firmware-upgradeable, meaning that what you buy will always be the same and the functionality will always be limited. </span></p>

<p>We care about your privacy protection and that is why we employ 256-bit encryption, which is the same level of security as used by NSA, NASA, the Pentagon. With 256 bit encryption and Google's security network, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AES</a> permits the use of 256-bit keys. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key </a>by brute force requires 2<sup>128</sup> times more computational power than a 128-bit key. 50 supercomputers that could check a billion billion (10<sup>18</sup>) AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3×10<sup>51</sup> years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.<br/></p>
<p>And you can rest assured that something like<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/08/27/baby-monitor-hack-could-happen-to-40000-other-foscam-users/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> this</a> doesn't happen with our camera's.</p>

<p><b><i>Can I use it outdoors?</i></b></p>

Proudly Presents



















Meet iCamPRO FHD, world’s first intelligent home security robot.

Unlike any other home security devices, iCamPRO is the first robotic home security camera that can actually see, hear, sense, and track moving objects, all while communicating with you. ""In today's world of clever thieves and
Industrial Saboteurs, the iCamPRO will record every movement in perfect detail
so you can identify security threats or common thieves and protect your
business and family,"" commented by David Rodwell, one of the campaign contributors. 



See Auto Tracking Demo Below


See Patent-Pending Ommidirectional Tracking
Pay attention to the black iCamPRO. It turns itself to where it detects an object even from behind, thanks to our multiple-sensor network embedded in the product to steer the camera in all directions.

Standing just over 3” tall and powered by a high-speed CPU with a patent-pending multi-sensor network, the iCamPRO is the smallest intelligent security robot that sees and tracks objects in real-time at your home or office, and even in a dimly lit environment.

Actual Size in Hand 





With multiple motion  sensors, no matter where the intruders appear in your home, iCamPRO can immediately rotate itself to capture the intruders in seconds. Real-time object tracking is an expensive technology that is available only in military or professional surveillance systems. Amaryllo is the first company to realize it with a compact design for your home or office at an affordable price.  

Our goal for this campaign is to collect invaluable feedback from those who are either experts or just enthusiasts about surveillance technology, as well as gain new ideas for how to make the iCamPRO more user friendly and attractive.

In return for your help, you will receive the finished product before it hits the market and at a price well below the retail value.




*Computer Rendering.  Packaging may differ slightly from the picture.  
Applications
Included in the box is an adjustable mount.  You can mount it on a flat surface, wall, or ceiling depending on your intended usage.  If you mount it on the ceiling, you can enable the 180° rotate feature in the app settings so you don't get an upside down view.  


Shown below is the custom-made brackets for iCamPRO FHD. Its compact design allows you to fit iCamPRO to wall or to ceiling. The bracket is made of high-quality material not only to fit the device well but also small enough to hide the bracket itself.

Full-HD Resolution


Using a 2 Megapixel lens serves two functions for the iCamPRO:

First, it allows for a crystal clear video stream and always FHD cloud recording.  

http://www.amaryllo.eu/n40822videodemo/Second, the FHD lens and image sensor gives extremely accurate pixel calculation and therefore a more accurate motion analysis for tracking moving objects.The iCamPRO also features dynamic channel adjustment.  This means that as your WiFi bandwidth increases or decreases the camera will automatically downgrade or upgrade the video quality so that the stream will always be smooth and without any video or audio delay.


Below is a shot of our cameras viewing angle of 100° without any distortion in the picture.


Here's a shot of one of the competitor's HD cameras inside a small office (notice the strange curvature of their industry standard fish eye lens):

 
This is a quick demo taken from one of our prototypes, make sure to enable the highest quality on the YouTube player.



Intelligent Tracking System (ITS)





The iCamPRO is the very first affordable camera that can automatically track any moving object. Our algorithms teach the camera to always keep the object in the middle of the viewing area.  When an object begins to move away from the pixels in the middle of the viewing area, the camera will track the object until it's in the middle again.

What if 2 people are in the tracking area?
The algorithm is designed to follow the first object detected until it stops moving. 
Basically, the iCamPRO is using the lens and PIR motion sensors to constantly hunt for any moving object.

This is from the other side to see how far iCamPRO can track. In the video below, a walking person is over 30 feet (9 meters) away from iCamPRO.


Below is a tracking test in a very dimly lit room.  




*Please don't mind the motor noise as these are just prototypes.



Smart Sensor Network (SSN)
This was a late decision to implement, however a truly innovative idea that is one of a kind.  



We will have 3 PIR motion sensors placed strategically around the iCamPRO and if one of the sensors is triggered, the camera will turn to face the object, lock in, and begin to track it using the ITS.  
Unlike any other home security devices, this innovative design ensures no blind spots or dead zones for intruders to hide, and removes the need to install a multiple camera security system.
As you can see by the videos only some of our prototypes have the sensors.  That's because we just recently began testing it, but only after a short while we are sure that you are going to agree that it is a remarkable feature.





       



Built-in Intelligence







The iCamPRO FHD employs a high-speed CPU to encode 256-bit encryption, encipher Full HD video, track moving objects, conduct two-way audio, deliver picture alerts, upload recorded video, etc
It communicates with multiple sensors and compares picture frames one-by-one to detect the slightest movement in real time. This is not an easy task as iCamPRO is taking Full HD picture in each frame and grid each frame in many small blocks to compare their changes. .
iCamPRO’s multiple sensors are always on, and these sensors work together to continuously feed information to its CPU. They are like scouts detecting heat signature even in the dark!!
Traditional security devices' CPUs run at 100 MHz to 200 MHz because they use simple encryption, which does not require a big computation power. For some IP cameras employing a 56-bit encryption, it takes only 399 seconds to hack, which is less than 7 minutes. For 256-bit encryption, it may take a life time to break. Moreover, conventional IP cameras are unlikely to be firmware-upgradeable, meaning that what you buy will always be the same and the functionality will always be limited. 

For the iCamPRO project, Teams from Google WebRTC offer us help in selecting chipset vendors, and some of the vendors have very powerful quad-core CPUs with running at 1.6 GHz. We try to balance cost and performance to make our products affordable for everyone, and that is why we won the top honor at 2015 CES Best of Innovation Award under ""embedded technology"" category.
Our embedded technologies allow us to continue enhancing iCamPRO's algorithm and functions through firmware upgrades. This means that iCamPRO will be continually learning and increasingly smarter.



 Mechanized Infrared-Cut Filter 

This special piece is only found in high-end cameras.  The reason is because this infrared filter is motorized and switches the lens depending on the lighting.  It improves the night vision in the dark and the contrast during the daytime when the sun is brightest.
With an IR-cut filter, you won’t see any purplish color under bright sun light and will be able to see better in the dark.







Listen to the click sound when the mechanic infrared-cut filters are switched and the infrared LED lights to turn ON or OFF automatically while tracking an object to yield the best video image under bright or dark environment .




*You can hear the filter switch at the time the IR LED comes on.



Infrared-LED Mask

iCamPRO has 8 built-in IR LEDs with a light sensor to trigger them on/off. Our patent-pending technology allows you to turn the IR LED lights ON or OFF from app. This is important as empirical data indicates harmful results if eyes are exposed to IR LED for a long period of time.
For aesthetics purpose, we chose to mask these IR LEDs by selecting a special material applied on a custom-made mask yet allowing IR to penetrate the mask when needed.

        Free Google Drive UploadAmaryllo is also the first company to offer free cloud storage to consumers. Through the application, you can link your Google Drive with your camera.Although the video is stored in your drive, you can manage and access them right through the app.  This saves you time and energy when searching for your video.  


           Real-Time Push Picture Alert

With built-in motion and audio sensors, you will receive a push text messages triggered by either motion or audio detection. The service is free.
                                                                                            


Push Picture with Time and DateBy tapping the phone's messages above, our app will download the push picture alert with time and date on the phone screen.


          



Push Picture with Time and Date
Push picture alerts will be kept for 3 days. The old pictures will be automatically deleted.





Amaryllo Application is available for Android and iOS

                              The iCamPRO has built-in motion and audio sensors. This means that it can sense and hear you. Our app allows you to select push picture alert and/or push text alert. Once the sensors are triggered, iCamPRO will send out push alerts to you and others who receive administrator rights to use your iCamPRO. 

The push alert typically takes 10 ~ 20 seconds to deliver to your wireless devices. In the app, you may check in to review all of the push picture alerts sorted by either “Motion Alert” or “Audio Alert”. The push picture alerts are “time-stamped” to indicate when the events took place. The timestamp can be removed from the app if preferred. In general, there is no limit on the number of push picture alerts stored, but the alerts will be kept for 3 days and automatically replaced by the new pictures.






We've seen a big demand for viewing multiple cameras on a split screen platforms and sharing cameras with others.  So, Amaryllo introduces “Amaryllo Live” where you can view all your cameras simultaneously from a PC browser or share your cameras with others.  The beta version is now available and you can view your own cameras at:
                                                    https://live.amaryllo.eu 


To access Amaryllo Live, you must have Mozilla Firefox web browser, Firefox browser supports Amaryllo Live; however, the rest of the browser companies have agreed to support Amaryllo Live and WebRTC in the very near future due to its recent growth in demand.


                                                  My Camera Page (above)



Above is the ""My Camera"" Page showing 4 different live streams.  Also, there are 2 featured cameras from our partner restaurants on the right. Below is a snap shot of a restaurant in a 24"" screen at Amaryllo Live.
Below is a video demo showing that you can view with a full screen at Amaryllo Live. You can swipe the PC browser to move the camera right, left, up, and down just like what you do with your smart phone. This is super convenient and easy to control.
 \






























How do I set it up?
We plan to have the setup procedure for the iCamPRO the same as our other products. 
The setup process takes only 1 minute if you know your WiFi password.  Our app will guide you through the steps and with a simple QR code scan, the camera is up and working. Here is the instructional video for the iSensor HD:


What kind of WiFi connection speed do I need?
Our Cameras have built-in WiFi 802.11 bgn and both downloading and uploading speeds depend on your available bandwidth.
For FHD, a minimum bandwidth of 2.0Mbps is recommended.



How long can I record video?  


World's Best 256-bit encryption?


We care about your privacy protection and that is why we employ 256-bit encryption, which is the same level of security as used by NSA, NASA, the Pentagon. With 256 bit encryption and Google's security network, AES permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2128 times more computational power than a 128-bit key. 50 supercomputers that could check a billion billion (1018) AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3×1051 years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.
And you can rest assured that something like this doesn't happen with our camera's.




Can I use it outdoors?
Sorry, no :(
 Most of our our products are not weatherproof.  Weatherproof cameras are easily a couple hundred dollars more than in-house IP cams.
The iCamPRO is able to capture outdoor video with great quality thanks to the IR-cut filter, however we do not suggest to put the camera outside.
Amaryllo IS planning to introduce an outdoor camera in early 2015.
Look for the iSensor HD ""Patio Edition"" to premier at CES in Las Vegas, 
Jan. 6-9, 2015

Can I mount it anywhere I want?

YES!  A 2-meter-long power adapter is included in the package. It converts 100 V ~ 240 V power to a 5V / 2A supply to iCamPRO FHD. 


Does it have night vision?Of course yo!  with the help of 8 IR LED, the iCamPRO can record FHD quality video in complete darkness.



The above room is PITCH BLACK, by the way.

days after my 14th birthday, my parents divorced. 
</p>
<p>
My Mom towed me and
my 3 younger siblings all the way from Illinois down to Florida: a
five day drive in a cramped silver pick-up truck in the middle of
winter. We had no place to go, no resources of our own, and only one
friend. He helped us look for a home, while we slept on the floor of
his mother’s guest bedroom and tried uselessly not to be a burden. 
</p>
<p>
Unwilling to let her
friend support us indefinitely, my Mom picked up a job waitressing at
Bob Evan’s and filled the rest of her time watching for ‘For
Rent’ signs that never seemed to be there. Nearly a month later,
she found what would become our first home: a mint green, 3-bedroom
with a fenced in backyard out in the middle of nowhere. 
</p>
<p>
We moved in and Mom
got a second job, waitressing at Sonny’s BBQ when she wasn’t at
Bob Evan’s or getting us off to school. After two years and some
pretty bad months, we finally got the hang of being on our own as a
family. I was in high school, my sisters were in middle school, and
my brother was in elementary school, but we were all equal partners.
Mom raised us to be strong and independent. In some ways, I guess
that’s what kept us all from going to pieces.</p>
<p>
Even when things
seemed to be working, I knew something was off. My Mom had us, but
she was the heart that kept us running and her heart was lonely. It
was at that two year mark when that began to change. On one of her
shifts at Bob Evan’s, one of her regular customers came in with his
son Jeff, a 36 year old lawn maintenance man who was running his own
small business. 
</p>
<p>
Though his father
introduced them and encouraged Jeff to ask my Mom out, Jeff was shy
and went to the restroom first to give himself a pep-talk in the
mirror. Even after that, he was barely able to give her his number
and invite her for a date. I don’t know exactly how it happened,
but it was like magic. One day they went out in his mud-truck, Betsy,
and the next he was moving in.</p>
<p>
Suddenly, <b>we were a
normal family again</b>. And I can’t deny that we had normal family
problems. It wasn’t easy for us kids to give up the equality we had
gotten used to and have real parents for what seemed like the first
time in forever. Jeff wasn’t like our father, who had abused his
power and left us shattered. It took almost a full year for us to
realize that he only wanted to help us. 
</p>
<p>
Before Jeff moved
in, we were just barely surviving. Once he was with us, things began
to change little by little for the better. Mom was able to give up
working at Bob Evan’s and, finally, had some time to spend with us.
We had clothes without holes, beds, food that wasn’t microwavable,
and another person that we could depend on. But it wasn’t only Jeff
we gained, he brought his son, Junior, and his dog, Brandy, with him.
Now<b> I can’t imagine a time without them</b>. 
</p>
<p>
Just as we were
getting on our feet, though, Mom lost her job at Sonny’s. We were
able to cope, but Jeff had to give up his business and bring in a
partner who had more connections. This man would end up lying,
stealing, and drinking his way through what was left of Jeff’s hard
earned cash. Soon we couldn’t afford our rent. Luckily, our
landlords were decent people and allowed Jeff to pay as he could.</p>
<p>
Mom found a job in
telemarketing and, for a few months, we were okay again. Then Mom
started having pains in her back and numbness in her shoulder and
arm. The doctors thought something might be wrong with the disks in
her spine and she had an operation that they said would fix it,
hopefully,  At first she felt better, but after a while the pain got
worse and she began to lose the use of her right leg. <b>Jeff worked
even harder to support us.</b></p>
<p><b>
In February of 2012,
my Mother was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). </b>Her
mother had had it, as well as 11 others on her mother’s side of the
family. We belong to the 10% of cases that are genetic. After finding
out what was going to happen to her, she begged Jeff to leave. She
tossed his bags out, yelled, and spent days acting like one of
Florida’s hurricanes, but it was all useless. Jeff dug in his heels
and proposed.  
</p>
<p>
By the time she was
diagnosed, my mother was struggling to use a walker and was unable to
work. Most days she was confined to bed. Having been independent for
the majority of her life and a capable mother of 4, she struggled
with her new weaknesses. <b>But she never gave up</b>. She just discovered
new ways to do things. 
</p>
<p>
After receiving a
HoverRound on loan, she broke free of her bedroom and began to
terrorize the house. If her hands couldn’t clean and cook, she
would direct someone else’s. If she couldn’t hold the pen to fill
out some forms, she would dictate what was necessary. She never once
lost her sense of humor, even when she lost the use of her one good
leg and had to have help to shower and use the restroom. 
</p>
<p>
Thanks to his lousy
business partner, Jeff struggled to get the bills paid. Some days
there was no water or electricity, but he always managed somehow to
get things done. He made time to sit down with my Mom and talk or
watch their favorite shows on TV. They still had fun together.
Another whole year passed and Mom’s condition stayed the same. She
could still sit up, use both of her arms, her breathing was mostly
normal, and she could speak. I graduated from high school and got
accepted into university, Mariah entered the summer before her senior
year, Alexis was about to start high school, and Nikolas was looking
forward to summer break. 
</p>
<p>
But the house that
we had come to love wasn’t big enough for us anymore. During the
summer, we adopted another dog and Mom’s wheelchair wasn’t easily
managed around tight corners and in narrow spaces. Mom needed special
equipment and room for us to help her maneuver, so Jeff contacted an
old friend who ran his own lawn care business nearer to the coast of
central Florida about a job. After hearing about our situation, they
jumped to help. 
</p>
<p>
I struggled with the
decision to either go off to college or stay home and take care of my
mother. Refusing to let herself become a burden, Mom made the choice
for me. When she was a sophomore in college, she dropped out to take
care of her own mother. She wouldn’t let me make the same mistake
and made sure that all of the arrangements were made so that I could
move into the dorms when the fall semester started. 
</p>
<p><b>
They found a house
for rent that was just the right size with a backyard that opens out
onto the canal. August of 2013, we moved to North Port.</b> At the end of
the month, I was carted off to the dorms at the University of South
Florida St. Petersburg Campus and Alexis started with online
schooling through Florida Virtual School (FLVS), so that she would be
home to help Mom. Thanks largely to an increase in regular pay for
Jeff and Mom’s social security disability benefits, my family was
able to survive. I was attending USFSP on the grace of academic
scholarships, grants, loans, and the work study program, so I was
glad not to be yet another financial burden. 
</p>
<p>
I skyped every week,
sometimes just to listen to everybody talk. Mom couldn’t feed
herself by Thanksgiving and when Christmas came around she had
completely lost the use of her arms. That spring her condition
worsened even further and she couldn’t sit up by herself and needed
an oxygen mask to make sure she didn’t stop breathing at night. The
ALS foundation found her a chair that she could move by blowing into
a tube and, again, she was mobile. 
</p>
<p>
Though they were
engaged, my Mom and Jeff had yet to get married. Because the family
was together for Christmas, Jeff decided that it was finally time. He
ran all over town for the ring, barely remembering the marriage
license. <b>On December 19th 2014, my parents were married at the
Sarasota courthouse. </b>My Mom wore white, had her hair and nails done
up, and her kids as her witnesses on the happiest day of her life. It
was the first time I saw Jeff cry, though he refused to admit to it. 
</p>
<p>
Spring came and the
ALS foundation was able to find a handicap equipped van, so that Mom
could leave the house again. When her 45th birthday came in May 2014,
she was able to enjoy herself with friends and family at a park. She
even got to eat some cake. My sister Mariah graduated just before
summer and Mom was adamant that she would join me at USFSP. 
</p>
<p>
To help that summer
before she left, Mariah got her first job at Lowe’s and helped with
what she could. I continued with summer school and found an
affordable apartment near campus and my job at the campus library.
When I could I visited home, but without a car of my own I couldn’t
always make it. 
</p>
<p>
On July 8th, 2014,
Mom went in for surgery to place a feeding tube in her stomach. Her
throat muscles were too weak for solid food. Due to complications in
the surgery, she stayed a few extra nights in the hospital, but still
came home complaining of pain in her stomach. 
</p>
<p><b>
On July 13th, 2014,
Mom stopped breathing and went into seizures.</b> The only ones home at
the time, Mariah and Alexis and Nikolas, called for an ambulance and then called
Jeff at work. Everyone was panicking. The ambulance came and they
were able to get her breathing again, but she was unresponsive and
the seizures continued. They rushed her to Tampa General Hospital.
For two weeks, we camped in the hospital waiting room. I was at
school when I got the call in the middle of class. Jeff came to get
me that night and we went to the hospital together. Mariah, Alexis,
Nikolas, Jeff’s mother, and Karen and Chyenne- family friends-were
already there. 
</p>
<p>
Family and friends,
who heard about the situation through phone calls and facebook
messages, sent money and their prayers. Two weeks felt like 10 years
as we waited, fearing the worst. Alexis and I slept in her hospital
room. The doctors tried to figure out how to stop her constant
seizures. They couldn’t tell us if she had brain damage. They put
her into a medically induced coma and hoped for the best. Jeff sent
me home for the next few days, promising to return if there was any
change. After a few days in the coma, they began to bring her out of
it. 
</p>
<p>
She woke up bleary
eyed and hardly responsive, but over the next week things changed,
The doctors had operated to place a hole in her windpipe, so that she
would be able to breathe (a Tracheostomy). <b>She could no longer speak
to us, but could only use her eyes to let us know what she was
thinking or a click of her tongue to let us know something was wrong.
The breathing machine meant that she needed constant care and
monitoring, but insurance at the time would not pay for a full time
nurse that would be required if we wanted to take her home.</b> She was
stuck in the hospital until the middle of September, when they
transferred her to a rehab center closer to home. 
</p>
<p>
Jeff went back to
work harder than ever. For a time, Alexis went back to public school.
Mariah moved into the dorms. In the back of everyone’s minds was
the fear that Mom would never get to go home again, that they would
only ever see her on weekends when they could. In mid-September, they
found her a nurse that could take an 8 hour shift during the day if
someone was home besides Mom to supervise her. 
</p>
<p>
Alexis went back to
virtual school and Mom got to come home. Now things are settling down
again. Everyone is getting back into a routine, but now <b>our landlord
has put the house up for sale</b>. Jeff works so hard to make rent and
pay the bills. We’ve held fundraisers and people have donated, but
it won’t be enough to keep our home. There is no place else that
Mom wants to be.

now been ravaging Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea since December 2013. The
global response from governments, organizations (both for-profit and non) and
individuals has been slow and, unfortunately, has not assuaged fears about
further impacts. Since the beginning of this outbreak our hearts ache knowing
that our brothers and sisters are dying from a disease that no one fully
understands or are prepared to battle. As a
global community, we can do much better. 
Over
the past month, PiAf Fellows have discussed ways to leverage our networks and
make a difference in this battle.  We have decided that directing our
efforts to Médecins Sans Frontières and vulnerable groups, such as
children (More Than Me) and the elderly (Last Mile Health) who live in remote villages, would have the most impact.  Past and current fellows have provided first-hand
insight, enabling us to identify these local NGOs and better understand
what is happening on the ground.  We are still in contact with these fellows to explore options for our own initiatives focused on these groups.
100% of your donation will go to the selected organizations as we have recieved support to cover campaign expenses.  Contribute today and help the fellows continue to make an impact on the continent we love!

Singer/songwriter Steven Zelin, also known as “The Singing CPA,” wrote the catchy song ""I'm Gonna Brush My Teeth"" with this in mind. His motivational tune first appeared on his children's album, “Magical Boxes,” available on iTunes and Spotify. </p><p>ToothyBeats pairs “I’m Gonna Brush My Teeth” with a battery-operated toothbrush. When a child presses the power button, the upbeat song plays and teaches kids the names of different teeth while they brush. After two minutes, the amount of time the ADA recommends we brush twice a day, the song and the brush both stop. </p><p>Kids focus on the song instead of the act of brushing, and parents get to relax instead of insisting their child keep brushing.</p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Your support means that we can give you the gift of ToothyBeats immediately—our first brushes are ready to ship!—and allows us to scale future production.</span></p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>The amount of money we’re trying to raise will help us scale our production of ToothyBeats.</p><p>Backing our campaign means you can receive a Toothy Beats brush immediately, and allow us to produce more for families across the country.</p><p>If we don’t meet our goal we will use the money to defray the costs associated with producing and shipping our first run of Toothy Beats.</p><p>We are sending our first ToothyBeats packed with extras that we’d like to include in future shipments:</p><p>• Extra batteries to help remind you that it’s battery operated (just replace the batteries by pulling out the bottom!).</p><p>• An extra replacement head so you will remember to replace the toothbrush head after 3 months.</p><p>• A hygienic cap so you can protect your ToothyBeats brush head.</p><p>• Stickers to customize your ToothyBeats toothbrush.</p><p><strong>How ToothyBeats Will Change Your Family's Morning and Nighttime Routine</strong></p><p>If you’ve been able to successfully encourage your child to brush his or her teeth for the recommended two minutes, twice a day, you are a miracle worker! For parents who find it hard to enforce this rule in the morning and before bed, ToothyBeats is the answer. It will make your life easier, and encourage kids to brush for two whole minutes without a fuss!</p><p>Many families have already received sample ToothyBeats brushes. Here are a few of their testimonials:</p><p>""Both my young boys have loved Steven Zelin songs since they were young toddlers, so you can imagine our joy to find out that their favorite tooth brushing song was captured inside an electric tooth brush, whoa! Sometimes the boys will brush for FOUR minutes (twice the recommended), just to jam out to that catchy song once more before bedtime.

Singer/songwriter Steven Zelin, also known as “The Singing CPA,” wrote the catchy song ""I'm Gonna Brush My Teeth"" with this in mind. His motivational tune first appeared on his children's album, “Magical Boxes,” available on iTunes and Spotify. ToothyBeats pairs “I’m Gonna Brush My Teeth” with a battery-operated toothbrush. When a child presses the power button, the upbeat song plays and teaches kids the names of different teeth while they brush. After two minutes, the amount of time the ADA recommends we brush twice a day, the song and the brush both stop. Kids focus on the song instead of the act of brushing, and parents get to relax instead of insisting their child keep brushing.Your support means that we can give you the gift of ToothyBeats immediately—our first brushes are ready to ship!—and allows us to scale future production.What We Need & What You GetThe amount of money we’re trying to raise will help us scale our production of ToothyBeats.Backing our campaign means you can receive a Toothy Beats brush immediately, and allow us to produce more for families across the country.If we don’t meet our goal we will use the money to defray the costs associated with producing and shipping our first run of Toothy Beats.We are sending our first ToothyBeats packed with extras that we’d like to include in future shipments:• Extra batteries to help remind you that it’s battery operated (just replace the batteries by pulling out the bottom!).• An extra replacement head so you will remember to replace the toothbrush head after 3 months.• A hygienic cap so you can protect your ToothyBeats brush head.• Stickers to customize your ToothyBeats toothbrush.How ToothyBeats Will Change Your Family's Morning and Nighttime RoutineIf you’ve been able to successfully encourage your child to brush his or her teeth for the recommended two minutes, twice a day, you are a miracle worker! For parents who find it hard to enforce this rule in the morning and before bed, ToothyBeats is the answer. It will make your life easier, and encourage kids to brush for two whole minutes without a fuss!Many families have already received sample ToothyBeats brushes. Here are a few of their testimonials:""Both my young boys have loved Steven Zelin songs since they were young toddlers, so you can imagine our joy to find out that their favorite tooth brushing song was captured inside an electric tooth brush, whoa! Sometimes the boys will brush for FOUR minutes (twice the recommended), just to jam out to that catchy song once more before bedtime. As a parent of two little monsters that will rarely sit still for two minutes to do anything, I can safely say that dancing while teeth-brushing is the easiest and most fun way to get all those 20 teeth shiny and clean. Thank you, Steven!"" – Adriane Stare“Jasper loves his ToothyBeats!

He was diagnosed at a time when he was out of work so had no health insurance, His bills have skyrocketed out of his control, We have lost our home , found a new one but in the illegal eviction from our home while he was in the hospital we lost everything, The landlord stole or broke anything he could find leaving us with very little, My father has been selling everything he owns to keep us afloat but now he is out of things to sell. His doctors refuse to do the surgery he needs because of no insurance and with out it offer him very little hope. I have watched him sit on the phone for days following every lead given to him to find help. I never thought I would see my father cry but lately he does and often, Everyone tells him to lower his stress so his body can fight the cancer but he just can't, with his world crumbling around him he is just not able to do anything. Mom tries to help but what can she do if he is giving up? We need a miracle at this point. My dad has been humbled to the point where he is turning into an empty shell of the man he was. I found this site by the grace of God and pray that people will find it in their hearts to help us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   My daughter asked me to introduce myself and tell a bit of my story and how it has come to this the most humbling experience of my life</p>
<p> </p>
<p> As you know my name is Dennis, I am 41 years young , I would like to let you in on the backround a bit please.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   I worked at a local steel mill for 8 years , about year 7 I started with some back pain and hip pain . I went to several doctors looking for a cause but they never found it, I through the year was getting very tired physically I mean and was slacking at my job because of it. Like most companies they would not believe my claims that there was a unfound reason , instead it was chalked up as lazy and they gave me back breaking job after job to get me to quit so they would have no unemployment claim.  I found my self with severe back pain and went to the ER , they diagnosed a kidney stone from the left kidney. Lets jump forward a bit but my health was getting worse and yes I had to walk away from the job. Well fast forward because after leaving there was no jobs to be found. In February of this year I woke to find I was urinating just blood, we rushed to the ER and this time they found the problem, A large high grade tumor in my bladder and a small tumor in the left ureter, Remember the kidney stone , same place . Anyway, Being out of work meant no insurance so . The initial visit to the hospital was a 6 day stay and a visit from an oncologist to explain that I needed to have my bladder removed as soon as possible and get started on chemo and radiation treatments In that order. The plan changed once they found out there was no insurance so they decided on the cheaper route which was chemo first, I was on round 3 of chemo when medicaid finally came through ( answered prayer right) well it seems at the same time my disability was approved , well the issue was when disability was approved it comes with medicare good so far right. NO it turns out that with medicare there is a 2 tear waiting period but yet menicaid stops at then. Well I had medicaid for 2 months total , before the medicaid was to expire I talked to my doctor and he said we needed to get ready for the surgery, Well he wanted 1 more round of chemo first which ended after the medicaid ran out so now back to square 1 on the surgery because once again no insurance. </p>
<p>  I have tried every place to find help including my own church just to be denied for help due to lack of funds not to say they wouldn't have liked to do more, I am not complaining, Times are tough and it just was not available . I love those in my church and know that if all they can give is a prayer , I will take it greatfully . </p>
<p> </p>
<p> I have tried to do this with just my family and the help of a very few good friends that have stood by me. </p>
<p> The way it stands now is if I can't start raising funds , the treatments will end and The cancer will win. I have no choice. Disability only gives me $1456 / month and with my medical bills above $60000 so far I can't make it. The medications they have me on alone are lovenox which is a shot I have to take 2 times a day , These shots are $375 per shot so for a 30 day supply that is $22500/month. Now with no medicaid those have ended . Chemo has stopped . The surgery has not been scheduled and may never be.</p>
<p>I know this is long and I am sorry but without the hystory I just seem lazy . The bottom line is if I can't get help then I will die. I don't know how to ask for this kind of help because I have always found a way for my family to make it and now I just have nothing left to offer. </p>
<p>  I know times are tough but if you can help me and my family please do . You will be helping to save my life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> All I can say is thank you and God bless those who have a kind heart that will help.</p></div>","This is my dad Dennis , he is one of the most hardworking and selfless men I could ever hope to know, He was diagnosed in February with High grade Muscle invasive stage 3/4 Bladder cancer, He has been fighting si hard .

<h3>Why in the hell are we doing this?</h3>
<p>It's simple, really. We have ideas. We have desires. We have dreams. Can you fault us for that? (Insert Successful 1st World Country) was built on dreams. The founders knew that in order to be successful and achieve those dreams, they had to launch a marketing campaign and raise funding through annonymous interweb donors such as yourself. ...It's in the history books people! </p>
<p>Look, our dream started with listening to podcasts. At first, there was just one. However, many more podcasts were added to our listening library. Some we loved; some we didn't. For the ones we kept, we found ourselves contributing ideas to those podcasts, and then, a lot of those ideas were used. Finally, it dawned on us! Why continue to contribute to others success, when we can do it ourselves?!?! Duh! So, that's why we're here, random citizen. We want to entertain you, and ourselves, at the same time. AT. THE. SAME. TIME. ...Mindblowing.</p>
<p>Michael The Red, Jablonski, Midwest Adam, and Lil' Boh all have various ""day jobs"" (corporate shill, Polish outdoorsman, meat handler, healthcare victim). However, we want our ""night job"" to involve a mixture of our thoughts, ideas, opinions, willingness to subject ourselves to large quantities of food and beer,  humor, seriousness, interpretive dance, etc., all put into podcast and webcast form. ...A legacy for our children to cherish.</p>
<h3>What can you do for us?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are an upstart. The economy affected us all like millions of others around the globe. None of us can fund such a project on our own (nor together in the near future). We all have bills and responsibilities. Some of us have drinking problems. Basically, we need equipment and an initial merchandise run. We have nothing. It's sad, really.</p>
<p>We've calculated that a meager sum of $5000 will give us the ability to purchase all of the equipment and initial merchandise that we will need in order to really get this project going properly. We don't want to sound horrible. We don't want to be 5 people sitting around 2 microphones with someone video recording on their phone. That's amateur. Rank amateur.</p>
<p>We need: computer, 5 mics, mixer, soundboard, video camera, software, web address/hosting, t-shirts, and bumber stickers. If we have any money left over after purchasing all of the equipment, it will go towards the supplies needed to do our food/beer challenges, for costume related items, and for other, here-to-unknown, items.</p>
<p>For your contribution; not only will you be highlighted on our first show--and through our Twitter and Facebook pages--with producer credit, but you will also be offered some incentives based on how much you give to our dream. See our ""Perks"" section for details. And remember...it's helping our children in a ""legacy"" kind of way.</p>

My daddy (Charlie) was diagnosed this year with colon cancer at 52 years young after a routine colonoscopy. As devastating as it is to hear, he still has a smile on his face and a joke in his mouth and we're so blessed to still have him around. He went through surgery in April to remove the cancerous mass and to determine what the next step would be. Hearing your dad has cancer is one of the worst sounds that you'll ever hear and hearing the cancer cells are in the lymph nodes isn't much easier.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My dad started chemotherapy 16 weeks ago and despite it's horrible effects, he's still a trooper, as always. On top of everything he's battling, he's unable to work because of the chemo. This is really hard for him (and everyone) because he's always been the rock of the family, strong ""like bull"", and hard-working and now I hear him say things like he feels like such a wimp because the chemo makes him so weak he can't stand or lift his arms. He says sometimes that he needs to ""man up"", but let me just say he's not a wimp, he's still my rock of a dad, that is fighting something bigger. He's the strongest man I know to be going through such a debilitating treatment and still be worried about us, not himself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On July 3, my grandfather passed away suddenly. While in the hospital, the doctors discovered that he had colon cancer, as well. I didn't know a situation that was already so devastating, could be worse. We are now in a position that most people (including us) don't plan for. The medical bills are extensive and when we add those on top of a mortgage and other expenses, it's overwhelming. We take everything day-by-day and try to look at the brighter side of life, the most important being that we still have our daddy and he will fight this and win.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your generosity will assist my dad in getting the medical bills off his mind and his mind on getting healthy again. Our family thanks you from the deepest of our hearts.

<h3>Golf For Everyone!</h3>
<p>Golf is a game of a lifetime!  Unfortunately, it is also probably one of the least handicapped friendly sport.  What if you could help change the way the game is played and perceived? </p>
<p>The Wolf at Tenkiller, a new golf course located near beautiful Lake Tenkiller in Eastern Oklahoma, is making plans to have a golf course built for everyone.  The vision is to have a 100% handicap accessible golf course.  We plan on buying two Paragolfers and 1 Solorider but will purchase more if we can raise the funds.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>What we are asking for is for $35,000.  This will purchase two Paragolfers at about $16,000 a piece.  We will use any remaining funds to purchase more carts including a Solorider which is ideal for the golfer that can still stand on their own but just can't get around as well as they used to.  This is an idea that is just starting to take root and you can be on the ground floor.  Anyone making a donation will be thanked on our website <a href=""http://www.thewolfattenkiller.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thewolfattenkiller.com</a> and you will have the satisfaction of giving the gift of golf to someone that may not think they have the ability. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will use the game of golf to promote healing and a sense of pride!  We are in development on programs to provide golf clinics for disabled veterans, Native Americans and charities that help the disabled.  Golf is truly the game of a lifetime and everyone should have the chance to enjoy it! </p>
</div>

<p class=""FreeFormA""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Background information</span></p>
<p class=""FreeFormA""><strong>Type 2 diabetes (T2D)</strong></p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">It is predicted by 2030, there will be approximately 400 million individuals with diabetes worldwide. In the US, about 1/3 of its population is at risk of being diagnosed with diabetes. Unfortunately, with the increase we will see a parallel increase in the diabetes-related complications. Diabetes is a metabolic disease and one of the most insidious diseases. Diabetes can be controlled but seldom cured. If not controlled it will destroy vital organs such as heart, liver, pancreas, eye and kidney. This diabetes-related complications cause health care costs to soar. In the US, 80% of deaths in diabetic patients die from heart disease. Diabetes is also the leading cause for renal failure, blindness and limb amputation. Historically, T2D was a disease mainly affected adults. This pattern has changed drastically during last 20 years as more young adults and children are inflicted with T2D. The pathophysiology of T2D is complex and involves multiple pathways and organs. This could include insulin resistance, pancreatic insulin secretory irregularities, increase of glucagon secretion, over production of glucose in liver and reduction of incretin and other hormonal abnormalities. </p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Current diabetes therapy regimen consists of medications which are synthetic chemicals and insulin. Because of the undesirable side-effects and the need to help control better from other mechanism of action, physicians are forced to prescribe additional medications to the two front-line medications (metformin and insulin). The addition of the medication is called adjunct therapy. Over 50% of adult population in the US takes supplements with or without attending physician's approval. The values of supplementation are often debated among health professionals in the US.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">However, clinicians in other advanced countries such as Germany and Japan are more open-minded about herbal supplements. Many herbal-based products in these countries are finding ways to become an important part of therapy.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Currently, a few supplement-based adjunct therapy agents are in the market, none with the evidence-based ingredients combination and none followed by a well designed standard as the proposed formula submitted this application. Furthermore, none of them are manufactured in an FDA-inspected GMP pharmaceutical manufacturing facility; the proposed finished product in this application will be produced exclusively in a pharmaceutical manufacturer governed by FDA.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Treatment Goals</span></p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">American Diabetes Association (ADA) glycemic goal is: A1c &lt; 7%, pre-prandial glucose level 70-130 mg/dL, postprandial glucose level &lt;180 mg/dL. American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE): A1c &lt; 6.5%,  Fast Plasma Glucose &lt;110 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial glucose &lt; 140 mg/dL. <em>Overall therapeutic goal: to control blood glucose and delay the onset of dangerous complications.</em></p>
<p class=""FreeFormA""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Approaches to Therapy</span></p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">ADA recommendation: </p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Step 1, life style changes plus metformin for the first few months. (Possible problems: patients often do not have energy to exercise and metfomin causes GI upset). Step 2, if ideal A1c level is not achieved or maintained after 3 months, basal insulin or sulfonylurea will be added. (Possible problem: insulin and sulfonylurea cause weight gain, an undesirable side-effect for diabetes patients and patient generally does not like insulin injection.) Step 3, in patients whose A1c is &gt;8, intensive insulin therapy will be added (Possible problem: at this stage, patient education and compliance is very important, there may be some signs of complication shown). At all three steps (stages), the life style management such as exercise, proper diet, etc., is an integral part of the therapy. Lack of energy among diabetic patients is a common phenomenon. An ideal therapy needs to control blood glucose and increase energy at the same time.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Rationale of Adjunct Therapy with Novel Evidence-Based Supplement Combination (NEBSC)</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">NEBSC is designed to provide energy for patient to exercise and lower glucose on its own to help medication such as Metformin to work better at a lower dose and this will ease the GI upset. Exercise regularly with NEBSC will enable patients to react to diabetes medication better, thus lessen the frequency and perhaps the amount of the medication. The end result could be delaying the progression of diabetes, thus, minimize the complications, minimize the side-effects (such as weight gain associated with prescription drugs by using less), increase energy to exercise for better sensitivity to insulin.  NEBSC can be a valuable non-prescription-based adjunct therapy at all stages of diabetes. It helps lower blood glucose, increase energy to exercise and provide nutrients to help delay deadly complications. Resulting in an overall reduction of health care costs and increase in patient well-being. </p>
<p class=""FreeFormA""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Significance</span></p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Considering the comprehensive beneficial ingredients discussed above as supplement-based adjunct therapy agents, we have developed a state-of-art formulation and standardization technology which provides ingredient integrity over the length of the shelf life. We have also determined the ingredient amounts and ranges. A double-blind clinical study is underway with this formula in Crittenton hospital affiliated diabetes clinic.  The goal of the study is whether NEBSC formula decreases A1c after three months of treatment when compared with placebo group.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Currently, the average range of A1c lowering ability of prescription based adjunct therapy agents is 0.5 to 0.70. If our study result falls within 0.1 to 0.5 ranges it will be a remarkable success.  Because it will be more economical to use and with less side effect and well tolerated, this constitutes a major finding in the diabetes therapy.</p>
<p>If successful, diabetes patients will have a better way to help them to control diabetes and delay the onset of diabetes associated deadly complications such as amputation, kidney failure and heart diseases.  In conclusion, this successful finding will save lives around the world.</p></div>","Project name

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Obesity is the second leading cause of unnecessary deaths in the United States.  Each year in the United States, more than 300,000 people die from obesity-related illnesses.  </p>
<p>Today 64.5% of all adult Americans (about 127 million people) are overweight, 60 million are obese, and 9 million are severely obese.  </p>
<p>About 30.3% of children (ages 6 to 11) are overweight and 15.3% are obese.  For teenagers (ages 12 to 19) 30.4% are overweight and 15.5% are obese.  When young people are overweight, there is a greater chance they will have chronic diseases later in life.  This is because people who become overweight as children usually have less active lifestyle and eat more foods with lots of calories and fats.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>25% of all the foods teenagers eat are ""junk food,"" like french fries, candy and soda.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To address obesity Healthy Leaders has developed new approaches to change cultural norms and attitudes towards healthy living.  We use new media, art, and technology to aid in outreach and education. Our goal is to make health and eco-consciousness a prevalent and lasting trend in communities throughout Los Angeles and eventually across the country. In order to achieve this we make food and fitness fun.  </p>

Have you ever been out and about and faced the temptation to eat junk food because a healthy alternative was either inaccessible, out of your budget, or waiting
in your fridge at home? I have been there before and I’m particularly bothered
when I’m in that situation with my nieces and nephews.  Nothing hurts more than giving in to
their cries for fast food.  We’ve
all hit that ""drive- thru"" out of convenience.   I was motivated to start Healthy Leaders to help out
parents, grandparents, uncles and aunties, like me, who are invested in raising
the standard of food that we offer our children.  In 2007 I bought and began restoring the Snack Attack
Truck.  With the help of local
artists, friends and family, we transformed this mobile food-vending unit into
the iconic landmark of Healthy Leaders. 

The mission of Healthy Leaders is to inspire emerging
generations to develop and sustain healthy bodies and healthy environments. Healthy
Leaders was created to engage youth and young adults in healthy living
practices by providing programs and services that appeal to their special
interests, popular pastimes and learning styles that are current in today's society.



We educate the public about nutrition while extending access
to healthy, low-cost foods through the Snack Attack Food Program. To leverage
the attention of youth and young adults, we tricked out an ice cream truck,
equipped with a sound system and broadcast capabilities to screen visual media.  At school, after school, during lunch
hour, or at special events, we bring the party: healthy snacks, fitness
activities, food tastings, promotions, green themed merchandise, and meals to
go! 
 
The Snack Attack Truck serves a wide array of nutritious
snacks; fresh produce, a fresh juice bar, baked goods, and an assortment of dry
goods such as nuts, popcorn, and dried fruits.  We also offer pre-packaged healthy dinner meals"" to go"" that
contain all the essential ingredients and recipes to make dinner for families. 

This program also provides a mobile platform for
community events.  We create a safe
space in parks and at after school programs for youth to participate in
our go green challenges, fitness trainings, and enrichment
activities.  




The Impact
Obesity is the second leading cause of unnecessary deaths in the United States.  Each year in the United States, more than 300,000 people die from obesity-related illnesses.  
Today 64.5% of all adult Americans (about 127 million people) are overweight, 60 million are obese, and 9 million are severely obese.  
About 30.3% of children (ages 6 to 11) are overweight and 15.3% are obese.  For teenagers (ages 12 to 19) 30.4% are overweight and 15.5% are obese.  When young people are overweight, there is a greater chance they will have chronic diseases later in life.  This is because people who become overweight as children usually have less active lifestyle and eat more foods with lots of calories and fats.

25% of all the foods teenagers eat are ""junk food,"" like french fries, candy and soda.  

To address obesity Healthy Leaders has developed new approaches to change cultural norms and attitudes towards healthy living.  We use new media, art, and technology to aid in outreach and education. Our goal is to make health and eco-consciousness a prevalent and lasting trend in communities throughout Los Angeles and eventually across the country. In order to achieve this we make food and fitness fun.  


We Need Your Financial Contribution and Support For:  
Truck Upgrades: 
We are gearing up for the 2011 summer season and we need your
help with a few upgrades that will improve our service capacity.  
·     
Engine conversion –  When we leave a group of happy kids with smoothies and
smiles it’s probably best that they not be left in a pool of exhaust.  We want to demonstrate business
practices that support the environment by going green.  That's why we're converting our engine
to run on LP (Liquid propane) an alternative fuel source that results in 70%
less air pollution. 
·     
Solar power panels – With solar power we can
utilize clean energy to power appliances and equipment.  Food trucks typically use a generator
for power.  The benefits of solar energy are elimination of fuel emissions and noise pollution.   Visitors of the establishments we frequent won’t be
bothered by the constant roar and fumes from a generator. 
·     
Kitchen renovation -  We’re expanding our menu to include fresh juice smoothies,
salads, sandwiches, and dream cream (our premier coconut base, non-dairy frozen
dessert).  We need purchasing power
for additional concession equipment, a sink, and a refrigerator.
Community Events: 
·      
Go Green Challenge – Once a month, we will host
“Go Green” challenges in outdoor settings. The purpose of these events is to provide a rallying point
to unite diverse communities that we serve.  During these sessions participants will challenge the body,
stimulate their imagination and creativity and cultivate their spirit of adventure.  Youth are paired with young adult
mentors and will go through a series of team building exercises that promote fitness
and raise eco-consciousness, as well as health awareness.
 
·     
Fun-Food-Fitness. - Live, from the Snack Attack Truck, Healthy Leaders will host regional dance contests  throughout the summer. 
Each week youth from the surrounding areas can come to compete, hang
out and move their feet while we serve refreshing treats. 
We’ll videotape dance performances and feature the winner on our
site.  Regional winners advance to a final
city-wide battle that we’ll host at the beach to close out our summer series.  
$$$
Guess what folks we're already half way there!!!  Private philanthropist Marcia Wright-Tillman has pledged a matching funds donation to help Healthy Leaders reach our fundraising goal of $30,000.  This means that if we can find 1,500 people to give just $10, or 100 people to give $150 dollars, or a single person to give $15,000, we're there!  Seriously everyone, no matter what you can afford to contribute, can support Healthy Leaders' summer launch.  Below is a breakdown of what your funds will go towards:

<p><strong>About the campaign…</strong></p>
<p><em>Men To Be Feared</em> by Rebecca Jane Stokes, produced by One21 Collective has been accepted into the 2012 New York International Fringe Festival! The story itself is a fairytale of sorts that explores the fine line between love, violence and loyalty in a kingdom torn apart by war and ruled by paranoia.</p>
<p>We’re so excited to present the world premiere of <em>Men To Be Feared</em> at FringeNYC – the largest multi-arts festival in North America – now we’ll finally have an international stage to tell stories as only we do…</p>
<p>One21 seeks to push the boundaries of modern day storytelling by utilizing a multifaceted approach in order to reach a broader audience. There’s a reason that Broadway shows are closing left and right, but a YouTube video has millions of viewers. Audiences have changed. By creating a short film that lives online, while producing a play from the same story allows us to expand our reach and bridge this great divide. We are creating a new method of storytelling that both reinvigorates theater and introduces our work to an expanded audience.</p>
<p>To that end, <em>Men To Be Feared</em> will be told in two parts – the first through a short film, shooting in July, and the second through our play at FringeNYC in August. Which is why we need your support!</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What we need…</strong></p>
<p>Because we’re used to producing HUGE works on a shoestring budget, we’re looking to raise $6,500, which will afford us the ability to shoot our 7-10 minute short film, and produce our full-length play.</p>
<p>We have a numbers guy that can break it down more specifically, but essentially $2,000 will go to our short film. This includes location and transportation costs, production insurance (yes, we’re creative AND responsible), feeding the cast and crew (we’re also hungry), costumes, props, and equipment rental. The remaining $4,500 will go to our play production. This includes renting rehearsal space, transportation stipends for our actors and crew (thank goodness public transportation is cheap), production insurance (again, safety first), set designer, set construction costs, lighting designer, printing promotional materials, costumes, props, and a light/sound board operator.</p>
<p>We know… you’re amazed at our penny-pinching ways – only $6,500 for all that?!? After living in New York for nearly six years we’ve learned a thing or two about stretching a dollar. Also, we have an amazing group of friends who have generously offered to volunteer their assistance in any way they can! We would LOVE for you to help in any way you can as well (even $1 gets us that much closer to our goal) and in return we have some pretty fun perks to dole out! (Check them out on the right.)</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What your contribution means to us…</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>The WORLD. It’s been our dream to finally showcase the method to our madness. And we know by engaging audiences in new ways not only will we reinvigorate theater but we’ll reinvigorate the arts.</p>
<p>And don’t worry if you can’t contribute financially, sharing this on Facebook and Twitter or even by shouting it out your window is a major help! Thanks in advance for your support and please follow us on Twitter <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/one21collective"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@One21Collective</a> or visit our website <a href=""http://www.One21Collective.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.One21Collective.com</a> to stay up to date on all our happenings!</p>

<p></p>There is no question that enjoying a drink is fun, and often the more you drink the more the fun increases. However, as many of us know all too well, it is that fine line between being pleasantly drunk and being completely intoxicated which can make the difference between waking up with a headache, or waking up in hospital, and that’s if you’re lucky!<br/>Well, all that can be avoided, while adding to the fun of a great night out with your friends.<br/><br/>And how? With <b>BACBUDDY</b> – the safe social drinking app and smartphone attachment which turns your phone in to a breathalyser. Just download the app, connect your <b>BACBUDDY</b>, and away you go, you’re smartphone’s now a breathalyser! Cool huh?<br/><br/>We think so, and we think it’s cool because everyone with the BACBUDDY can connect with each other and monitor who’s drunk what. Gone are the days when the designated driver can sneak a few drinks, as the BACBUDDY will keep them on the straight and narrow, and often the person who has drunk too much won’t realise, but his friends will, because the BACBUDDY will alert them!<br/><br/><b>With the BACBUDDY we want you to have fun, but remain safe at the same time!</b><br/><br/>Have you ever been out in a group and lost someone by the end of the evening? Usually they’re too drunk to answer their phone or they’re in somewhere so noisy, they can’t hear it ringing. What if you’ve just become lost in a busy street and don’t know where everyone has gone? It’s even worse if this happens when you’re in a strange town and don’t know where you are – how can you tell your friends where to find you? This situation becomes even scarier if you are a young woman and it’s the end of the evening. <br/><br/>Thanks to the <b>BACBUDDY</b> design, not only will you be able to see where all your friends are, but they will know where you are too. Don’t you think it’s great to have an app that lets you know everyone has made it home safe and sound, rather than having to face a different scenario when you wake up the next day, because every story should have a happy ending?<br/><br/>Start the evening as you mean to finish it – safe and well. Enjoy your night out, have fun, and let the <b>BACBUDDY</b> keep a watchful eye over you and your friends.<br/><p></p>

<p>As the App is focused in Safe Social Drinking, it will alert all the <strong>BACBUDDIES</strong> when the situation becomes potentially unsafe for one, or more of the group.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>  If the <strong>BACBUDDY</strong> Guardian Angel or Chauffeur has an inappropriate BAC level, <strong>BACBUDDIES</strong> will be alerted, and either they are advised to stop drinking alcohol immediately, or contingency measures can be taken, like booking a taxi</p>
<p>  If the <strong>BACBUDDY</strong> Guardian Angel or Chauffeur don't check their BAC level periodically, <strong>BACBUDDIES</strong> will also be alerted, and advised to take appropriate action.</p>

<hr style=""height: 3px;""/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center; color: blue;"">Track your friends with BACBUDDY Maps Feature!</h3>
<p>This is not only a great safety feature of the app if you get separated on a night out – especially if you are one of a group of girls -  but you can also track your friends’ position and supervise their BAC levels. If you lose track of your friends, or they lose track of you, the application can be used to easily identify everyone’s location.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center; color: blue;"">EMERGENCY TRACKER</h3>
<p>Sadly is not uncommon for young girls to be raped or even murdered after becoming separated from their friends on a night out. <strong>BACBUDDY</strong> could have saved lives if it had been used as it is a great tracking device.</p>
<p>In Scotland last year a young man died on his way back home from a night out drinking as he got lost in the snow - if he had had <strong>BACBUDDY</strong> app, then they would have found him before he froze to death.</p>

Tous les deux passionnés de mécanique nous souhaitons nous lancer dans l'aventure du 4L Trophy. Cette expérience serait pour nous très enrichissante autant du point de vue personnel qu'humanitaire.Si vous souhaitez des renseignements complémentaires concernant notre projet vous pouvez vous rendre sur notre page facebook :https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tout-pour-L/5413...

Le 4L Trophy


 Inspiré
par le Paris-Dakar, le 4LTrophy est organisé pour la première fois
en février 1998 avec 3 voitures. 16
ans plus tard, ce n’est pas moins de 2700 étudiants dans 1350 4L
qui sont attendus en février prochain sur la ligne de départ de
Saint-Jean de Luz et de Poitiers pour la 16ème édition ! En
effet, du 19 février au 1er mars 2015 plus de 1300 équipages
européens s’élanceront pour un défi
sportif et humanitaire hors du commun.
Le
Raid 4L Trophy est une formidable aventure humaine, sportive et
solidaire pour les étudiants âgés de 18 à 28 ans. Il n’est pas
question de vitesse, mais d’orientation pour l’emporter. En
2014, 16ème anniversaire de ce grand événement, ce furent plus de
80 tonnes de fournitures scolaires acheminées !



L’objectif
est simple :

Parcourir
à bord d’une Renault 4L, pendant une
dizaine de jours, plus de 6000 km à travers
la France, l’Espagne et le Maroc, afin d’acheminer
des fournitures scolaires et sportives
aux enfants les plus démunis du Maroc.



Objectif
quotidien pour les participants au cours du raid :


	Rallier
l’étape du jour à l’aide d’un road-book, d’une carte et
d’une boussole. Le respect de l’environnement est au centre du
4LTrophy et s’inscrit dans une démarche
éco-citoyenne.

<p><b>Significance of my Transformation
Journey</b></p>
<p>I am so honoured that I was recommended as
a part of team Jamaica for the CAC championships! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/ayanna-t-samuels/my-review-of-my-st-maarten-cacbbfa-amazing-experience/10152358388552548"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here</a> is a review of my deeply rewarding CACBBFC experience. Additionally, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-AsjbRGXVw&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a> is a short video clip from the championships! JABBFA was unable to fund my CACBBFC expenses and I am grateful that I was able to successfully stage a crowdfunding
campaign in order to compete!</p>
<p>Having been recommended to compete
internationally means the world to me, in particular because I had 4 car
accidents and 4 bicycle accidents over a 4 month span in 2013, the worst of
which involved being thrown off my bicycle and landing with my head in front of
the back driver's wheel. I am alive today purely because of divine
intervention. That accident made me very aware of the gift of life and
impassioned to live my best life now!</p>
<p>2013 also saw me struggling with
recovering from knee surgery, dealing with an unplanned medical diagnosis,
being the victim of a police matter and other such character tests. However
these “learning experiences” gave me the extra layers of strength and insight I
needed to prepare me for the mental and physical challenge of amateur
bodybuilding. Given the emotional upheaval that was 2013, I feel so lucky and
blessed to <i>even</i> <i>be</i> on this path.</p>
<p>The
challenge of competing at the CAC Championships was especially poignant for me,
as it was a living, tangible embodiment of my commitment to getting into the
best shape of my life! I have already been on quite a journey, going from 149
lbs 12 years ago, down to 108 lbs and 13.5% body fat on my July 5, 2014 competition
day. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the noticeable physical
transformation, the biggest changes for me have been the spiritual,
emotional and psychological changes I have had to effect!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/937791/files/20141017053716-Annotated_Before_and_After.png?1413549436"" src="""" style=""width: 547.844827586207px; height: 410px;""/></p>

<p>Achieving this transformation required me to push way out of comfort
zone. I also had to effect holistic changes in my nutrition that I’ve now
permanently infused into my life and which have played a significant role in
goals achieved thus far. I now am determined to keep pushing so I can excel at
the highest levels and proudly represent Jamaica! I think you know that when
Jamaicans approach anything in the world of sport, we don’t aim for bronze or
silver… we are going for the <b>GOLD</b>!</p>

<h3>So... Why?<br/>
</h3>If you're a Nerfer then you'd know about the Stampede. I love the Stampede but it is getting on in years and the plastic the stock gears are made from will crack because of a high spring load and the age of the gears. What I want to do is give the Stampede a new lease on life in the form of upgrade gears made from a stronger polymer.<br/><br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What Are The Gears Made Of?</h3>
<p>The polymer I'm using is a 
patented formula owned by DuPont. It's the same polymer used in the 
gears for power windows in cars. Ever tried to hold a power window down 
while winding the window up? Can't do it, that's how much torque this 
polymer can handle.<br/><br/>But why not metal? Metal is more expensive 
and to make it cost effective means making the gears from a cast. Metal 
will also grind, filing your Stampede with metal dust that will increase
 wear on other components. Plastic doesn't grind and will slip against itself.</p>
<p>Forget Polycarbonate and Nylon66. This polymer is stronger than both of them!<br/></p>

</div><div>I'll just come out an say it, I need AU$30'000 to get this project off the ground.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Camp Corazones is an
annual camp, now in its 20th year, for the kids &amp; families affected by
HIV/AIDS. Majority of the kids who attend this camp, come from poor financial
background and travel costs to the camp (there is no fee to attend this residential
camp) can be a major decision factor in kids and their families attending the
camp. With the help of this campaign, we are hoping to give few scholarships to
the kids &amp; families and enable them to come to the camp. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the kids look forward to this camp year long as it gives them
opportunity to get away from their family's daily struggles and unfortunately,
the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. As part of the camp, kids get to do fun
activities for four days including rock climbing, science experiments, painting
etc. Camp itself was started by Ms. Jewel Cabeza de Vaca in 1995 and since then
it has provided camp environment, to affected Kids &amp; families, that
focuses and supports children and their families to bond, share meals, make new
friends and peer connections.   <br/>
<br/>PS. Any donations to the camp are 100% tax deductible. In addition, there is no
administrative fee and 100% of the donations will go towards the camp and
travel grants.</p>

</h3>
</div><div> <p>Unfortunately we don't have enough money and we need at least one thousand dollars to help 20+ kids and their families travel from El Paso, TX to the camp in Santa Fe (over all camp strength this year is approximately 50 kids) .

Any additional money will be used for the camp next year. I would like to emphasize that unlike many other charities there are no administrative costs with this camp and all of the money will go towards making the camp an awesome experience for the kids.  </p>

I receive 6 hour dialysis treatments 3 nights per week at a Davita Dialysis facility. These treatments almost always leave me without energy, and with extreme muscle pains. (The feeling of getting the wind knocked out of you lasting for sometimes an hour is close to the feeling when my abdominal muscles decide to cramp). This leaves me unable to work and at the mercy of a small disability check each month. I recently had my Parathyroid glands removed so that my bones would stop causing agony from pain of losing calcium. I was also set back a lot by a tornado that left me without clothing and my apartment for a year (attached video) in April of 2013. I am so blessed to have my sister's who set up a raffle benefit in my honor which allowed me to purchase some clothing and pay my gas and electric bills off. My older sister also allowed me to stay in her small home along with 10 other people until I could get my apartment back.
This campaign was the idea of friends and family who want me to raise money to allow me to pay off old student loans so I can get back in school (Mechanical and Structural Engineering), also to get a reliable vehicle to get to and from my dialysis treatments. I am also in need of food, cleaning supplies, toiletries, furniture, clothing, vacuum, amongst other things. I am a man that can have too much pride at times, but I am DESPERATE.
 The funds collected during this campaign will go to myself, Arthur C Lindquist Jr, to help me in ALL the aspects of what it will take to accomplish these large and small goals. I also have a goal of a healthy kindney transplant my body sees as its own. I want to see that day come and I'm sure the 18 children from my multicultural family that consider me their UncleArt, and the rest of my friends and family want to see that day come too.

She owns a house with her mom and enjoys her life. She contributes to the health and well being of her community both through her work by her contributions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jen has thyroid cancer, but she doesn't have insurance, and she needs help covering the cost of care.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a licensed, practicing massage therapist, Jen Pellingra has dedicated her life to helping heal others. She works in a small chiropractic office in northern Westchester County, NY. She keeps her rates low so that her work is accesible to all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 2001, Jen's father, a disabled Vietnam veteran, died and left behind a massive pile of debt (over $200,000). Jen assumed responsibility for debt, took over the mortgage on her parents' home, and continued to serve her community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every year Jen Pellingra donates much of her time and almost $1000 annually in massage gift certificates to local fundraising efforts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jen has always put everyone else's needs above her own. Because the clinic where she works fights to provide affordable care for everyone in the community, Jen's job hasn't been able to provide her with insurance. And because she's been working to pay down her father's debts and take care of her mother, she hasn't had enough money to buy insurance for herself. She also makes too much for Medicare.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, Jen's stuck between a rock and a hard place, and needs help to cover the cost of her care.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fortunately, the prognosis for thyroid cancer is very positive, and treatment is fairly simple. First, Jen needs to have her thyroid gland removed. Doctors have also found a small spot on her lung, which they plan to remove as well. Once Jen's thyroid glad has been removed, she'll see the doctors for rounds of follow-up and testing, and will be put on medicine to replace the hormones that her thyroid will no longer be producing. After that, she'll need a round of radioiodine treatment to make sure the cancer is wiped cleanly from her body.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sounds pretty easy, right? It would be if Jen had insurance. But, because she doesn't, the whole process is made much, much more difficult. Jen will have to have multiple exams and tests, she'll spend days in a hospital, and she'll be treated by a team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists, their assistants, nurses, and a host of other doctors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>""This has been a powerful experience"" says Jen.

About My Goal
What does it mean to be transgender?


Transgender is an umbrella term used to refer to when an individual's biological sex does not match that of their gender. While it is often grouped with the LGBTQ* community, it's important to note that transgender is not a sexual orientation, and instead an expression of one's gender.
Female to male (FtM) trans* individuals oftentimes change their appearance in order to more accurately reflect their gender identity and to feel more comfortable in society. One of the most common change in appearance is compressing the breasts in order to create a male-looking chest. Even though there are 'safe' ways to chest-bind, some of the dangers of compressing the chest include rib bruising or fracturing, difficulty breathing, spinal and shoulder problems, and lack of circulation to the general area. 

What is Top Surgery?


Top surgery allows for a presentable and convincing male appearance through the removal of the breasts for FtM individuals. Individuals who have had top surgery can live their lives much more comfortably without having to deal with chest binding.
The surgery takes 4-6 weeks of recovery time. Since I am a student, I can't afford to take off a month or more from my classes in order to recover. That's why I plan to schedule my date over the winter break, so that I will be healed by the time the spring semester begins.

What does my goal of $8,000 cover?


$8,000 covers the cost of surgery, hospital fees, surgery date deposit, roundtrip airline tickets for my mother and myself to the hospital in Florida, a hotel room for the week that I will be down there, food and taxi money. Any additional money that my campaign raises will go towards paying my monthly apartment rent while I recover from surgery.
$500 has been added to the overall goal to pay for indiegogo fees.

You can choose the way it alarms you, either by sound or vibration so it makes sure you wake up. Besides this it has an advanced function of calling or sending SMS message to a chosen phone number – this has various advantages. Lets say you leave your child with a babysitter or send him to kindergarten you can always know if he gets high temperature – really smart isn’t it? Also you can monitor temperature in real time and see the temperature history graph curve. Take that temperature graph curve to your doctor to have a third hand in diagnosing sickness.</p><p>Also it can be used with anyone as it comes with two sized comfortable velcro bands (old people, extreme athletes, etc.)</p><p>Tired of looking around for batteries?  no problem as it comes with rechargeable battery that lasts 40+ hours.

You can choose the way it alarms you, either by sound or vibration so it makes sure you wake up. Besides this it has an advanced function of calling or sending SMS message to a chosen phone number – this has various advantages. Lets say you leave your child with a babysitter or send him to kindergarten you can always know if he gets high temperature – really smart isn’t it? Also you can monitor temperature in real time and see the temperature history graph curve. Take that temperature graph curve to your doctor to have a third hand in diagnosing sickness.Also it can be used with anyone as it comes with two sized comfortable velcro bands (old people, extreme athletes, etc.)Tired of looking around for batteries?  no problem as it comes with rechargeable battery that lasts 40+ hours. Just charge it through provided USB cable on any device with 5V standard USB port.It all comes in a quality built plastic shell and with stable android app.iSense has been on testing for more than 1 year to prove its stability and now it is ready for the market, however as it is only part of the complete system that includes your own android device we cannot take responsibility for malfunction on that account. Please also note that this is not professional medical device and as such should not be used.What We Need We need $2000 to finalize the android application (professional graphic design to make it complete) and to design and manufacture packaging for distribution.First batch of iSense is already manufactured and awaiting packaging so you can be assured it will find a way to youWhat You GetYou will be the first to get iSense at prices to be never repeated. You will also get a device that is unique in its functions and helps in tough situationsIf You believe in our product and want to help us get the word around the social networks and a word of mouth we will reward you:If you refer 5 people that pledge $40 or more we will send you one iSense free of charge together with your selected perk, you have to be a backer yourself.We believe that iSense can improve everyone's quality of life!!!So spread the word around and lets make everyone's life easier!!!

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>I
am Mallory Carlson. In early August, 2013 I received my diploma for a
Masters of Acupuncture from Northwestern Health Sciences University.
My time since has been spent with my nose in the books, studying for
boards – as well as gathering resources to start up my wellness
practice this coming winter. As I also do Craniosacral Therapy, I
look forward to incorporating both healing modalities in my practice.
I believe immensely in the power of these therapies, and it is my
goal to raise the funds to create the optimum healing potential in my
office space.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For
those of you who don't know much about these therapies, let me offer
a concise explanation of each: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u><b>Acupuncture</b></u>
is an ancient form of healing which began in China around 3000 years
ago. It involves the insertion of fine, solid filiform needles into
the skin at specific points (acupoints) to achieve a therapeutic
effect by restoring balance to the body. Qi (chi) is a basic concept
in Traditional Chinese Medicine - it is the essential life energy
within each person and throughout all of nature. It may also the
thought of in terms of the function of the body; qi is the force that
keeps the body systems running smoothly. When qi is out of balance in
one way or another, this is when many problems can arise. Acupuncture
is an effective and safe therapy which can be used to encourage qi
back into harmony and return the body to a state of health. <br/></p>

<p>Licensed Acupuncturists not only use needles for treatment, but other ""accessory techniques"" as well. Just a few examples of this include:</p>
<p><i>Cupping: </i>Glass cups are place on the skin to create a suction effect. This stimulates blood and qi flow to the local area and can be used to treat conditions from neurological to muscular to visceral.</p>
<p><i>Auricular (Ear) Therapy:</i> This is the use of small acupuncture needles or adhesive beads to stimulate specific points on the ear. There are many points on the ear which correspond to all of the different areas of the body. The needles are used only in the office during the treatment; the beads, however, are placed onto the ear points and retained for 2-3 days so that the patient may stimulate them for prolonged benefits.</p>
<p><i>Acupressure: </i>For individuals who may be sensitive to needles, acupressure is an effective alternative. This is simply the stimulation of acupoints using the pressure of the practitioner's fingers.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p>
<p><u><b>Craniosacral
Therapy (CST)</b></u> is the gentle manipulation of the body
to promote physical and emotional wellness, relieve pain, repair
dysfunction and restore the natural position of bones and tissues.
CST is a non-invasive therapy which focuses on the head, spinal
column, sacrum and various joints of the body. Much of this therapy
involves tuning into the body's own wisdom and then facilitating it
in adjusting and healing itself. CST is beneficial for relief and
management of many existing conditions - as well as preventative care
to enhance resistance to disease.

<h3><b>What is cell proliferation and how can it be a problem...?</b></h3>
<p>In a healthy tissue cells duplicate to replace other cells that have exhausted their functions. This is a very important mechanism to keep the integrity and function of any organ of a human body. Cell division results from activation of a very sophisticated <b>signaling network,</b> <i>the software of a cell. </i>Instead of on/off switches and wires, the cellular network is made of proteins and molecules that respond to external inputs (e.g. growth factors) as well as to internal instructions (e.g. DNA, RNA, and proteins) to execute programs that stimulate or arrest growth. Like musical instruments playing in a concert, activity of a protein or molecule is activated or suppressed in an harmonious and time-dependent manner to keep cell duplication under control and occurring only when really needed. </p>
<p><i>Cancer cells escape the ""off command"".</i> <b>Cancer is ultimately the result of cells that uncontrollably multiply. </b> An expanding mass will ultimately occupy all the available space, disrupt organ integrity and impair their functions. Moreover, during their fast and furious proliferation some cancer cells can activate programs that will allow them to <b>invade adjacent tissue</b> and eventually <b>migrate to distant sites</b> in which they will continue to proliferate... indefinitely. The result is catastrophic. </p>
<p>Despite the effort of a multitude of scientists and clinicians who are actively involved in fighting and or prevent cancer, death of millions of cancer patients occurs annually worldwide. A death that is too often occurs in otherwise young and healthy people poses a compelling drive for our search for new therapeutic drugs and/or new targets.</p>

</div></div>","I am a scientist interested in understanding the mechanisms through which cancer cells grow, move and invade body compartments causing death. During my training I traveled the world to obtain knowledge and develop techniques to investigate the function of a class of proteins called: Ion Channels. Traditionally, these proteins are considered essential to the function of the brain. Ion channels make cells of the brain operative. Nevertheless, our and others recent discoveries have revealed that ion channels can play a fundamental role in controlling cell proliferation of many tissues including cancer.Sono uno scienziato interessato a capire i meccanismi attraverso cui le cellule del cancro crescono, si muovono ed invadono il corpo causandone la morte. Per i miei studi ho viaggiato nei laboratori del mondo per imparare tecniche ed acquisire le conoscenze per investigare la funzione di una classe specifica di proteine chiamate Canali Ionici. Queste proteine sono state spesso associate al funzionamento del cervello ma sia i miei recenti studi sia quelli dei mie colleghi hanno rivelato che i canali ionici giocano un ruiolo fondamentale per la crescite delle cellule del cancro.With my group at Loyola University Chicago we are focusing on how we can manipulate ion channels to stop cell proliferation in cancer.  We have shown these ion channels to be critical regulators of cancer cell multiplication AND FDA approved drugs for these channels are already on the market.  We need to: 1) take this research forward and develop data in support of clinical trials, and 2) develop citizen advocates and supporters of this research to help us succeed. Con il mio gruppo alla Loyola University Chicago stiamo studiando un metodo che implica la manipolazione farmacologica diei canali ionici per fermare la proliferazione delle cellule del cancro. Il nostro impegno si focalizza:1) Sviluppare questa ricerca con lo scopo di iniziare studi sugli uomini2) Sviluppare una coscienza nei cittadini del mondo per porare la nostra ricerca al successo.


In my laboratory we try to answer the following questions: 
- What are the ""X"" factors that comprise ""on switches"" for cancer cell growth? - How can we use this knowledge against the cancer?Nel mio laboratorio ci siamo posti le seguentidomande: - Quali sono gli ""X"" factors che servono alle cellule del cancro per crescere?
- Come possiamo usare queste conoscenze contro il cancro?
Many types of cancers express a ion channels that are not present in tissue from which the cancer have been generated. This suggests that ion channels may be a ""X"" factor that contribute to cancer cell proliferation. 
Molti tipi di cancro esprimono canali ionici che non sono presenti nei tessuti che hanno generato queste cellule. Questo fatto suggerisce che i canali ionici possono essere uno deigli ""X"" factors che contribuiscono alla proliferazione dellecellule del cancro 





Can we turn ion channels activity against cancer?
Research in my laboratory has brought to light for the first time that chronic stimulation of a specific class of ion channel, (potassium ion channels) stops proliferation in cancer cell… indefinitely.  However, we face many speed bumps in prosecuting our science. Some see this as a radical idea, and there are barriers to re-purposing drugs from one purpose to another.  This is why we need to develop the science and the public advocacy.

Possiamo usare i canali ionici contro il cancro?
La ricerca nel mio laboratorio ha portato alla luce perla prima volta che la stimolazione cronica di una specifica classe di canali ionici arresta la proliferazione delle cellule cancerigene... indefinitivamente.

Molti vedono la nostra ricerca come uan idea radicale (clicca sul link della global medical discovery sopra). Altri pongono barriere per utilizare molecole che gia' esistono sul mercato che porterebbe inevitabilmente ad un ABBASSAMENTO dei costi della terapia. Questi sono i motivi per cui abbihamo bisogno di sviluppare con VOI tutti una coscienza che ci portera' a mogliorare le condizioni sia della ricerca sia della terapia. 

In summary, we found that breast cancer cells treated with drugs that stimulate potassium Ion Channels respond by suppressing the duplication program. Drugs that stimulate these channels are already available.  We just need to know how to deploy these drugs to stop the cancer! We are short manpower and it takes years to gather the grant funding to do this.  We are asking YOU to help us move this forward NOW for the benefit of cancer patients. 

Riassumendo, i nostri studi hanno portato alla conclusione che in cellule del cancro al seno (ed altri tipi di cancro) che vengono trattate con stimolatori di alcuni calai ionici smettono di proliferare. Queste molecule sono gia' presenti sul mercato e non dobbiamo re-inventarle. 
Ora abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per poter reclutare scienziati che hanno capacita' tecniche  per poter approntare gli esperimenti necessari per portare questa ricerca avanti. Ti chiediamo di contribuire allan ostra ricerca e di aiutarci a muovere in avanti i nostri studi sul cancro.

Siamo molto orgogliosi dei risultati della nostra ricerca sul cancro. Non abbiamo curato questa terribile malattia e non possiamo ancora dire quando questo accadra' ma le nostre scoperte hanno identificato una nuova via per muoverci piu' veloci verso questa meta. 
The immediate goal of this fund raise is to collect $50.000 or more that will be allocated for a scientist salary. Your contribution will help hiring a scientist with skills and knowledge that have prepared this individual to join our fight against cancer. We need this person to move forward battling cancer, now that we have identified an opportunity with real clinical possibility.
Lo scopo di questa raccoltra fondi  e' di raccogliere 50.000 dollari da destinare per l'assunzione di uno scienziato con la preparazione tecnico-scientifica adeguata  per eseguire appropriatamente igli esperimeti disegnati nel miolaboratorio. Noi abbiamo identificato la via da seguire, ora abbiamo bisogno di chi la percorre con noi. 
What this scientist will do?
Paradoxically, the efficacy of drugs used for cancer therapy is severely limited by their concentration-dependent toxicity that can become intolerable for the patient. 


- We want to reduce the side effects of anticancer drugs by combining them with ion channels stimulators. The hired scientist will test the effects of drugs-mix to establish the minimal and most efficient dose for each component in suppressing cancer cells growth. Results from this research will help to improve chemotherapy by rendering drug treatments less poisonous to the patients.
- Vogliamo ridurre gli effetti collaterali dell eterapie anticancro. Gli esperimeti condotti con l'aiuto della persona da assumere ci aiuteranno a stabilire la dose minima indispensabile delle molecole per ottenere gli effetti gia' osservati nei nostri studi. 
- We want to test the effects of ion channels activators on more cancers. The hired scientist will be involved in testing the effects of ion channel activators alone or in combination of other  anticancer drugs on different type of deadly tumors including pancreatic and brain cancers. Results from this work will expand our knowledge on manipulation of ion channels activity in cancer.
- Vogliamo studiare gli effetti degli stimolatori dei canali ionici su piu' tipi di cancro. Lo scienziato da assumere ci aiutera' a studiare gli effetti delle molecole combinate con altre drghe gia' esistenti sul mercato. I risultati di questi studi ci porteranno a capire come combinare diverse molecule per ferare la crescita delle cellule del cancro.  
- We want to cut down therapeutic expenses. Ion channels activators are already present on the drug market for treating conditions that are not cancer related. We plan to activate a therapeutic switching program by re-purposing ion channels activators. Results from this research will inevitably lead to a dramatic decrease of costs for therapies.
- Vogliamo ridurre i costi delle terapie. Le molecule che stiamo studiando sono gia' presenti sul mercato. Il nostr opiano di azione implica l'impegi di queste molecole combinate con stimolatori di canali ionici. I risultati di questi approcci porteranno ad un abbattimento radicale dei costi terapeutici. 
- We want you to play a role in the project 
A very important part of our job is to report our discoveries to the scientific community worldwide by publishing results from our studies in peer reviewed scientific journals. However, it is our opinion that the information flow cannot end here, especially if a research study concerns a disease that virtually affects everyone on the planet. We strongly believe that in the modern communication era a scientist is also called to describe his/her scientific results to a broader population. If you have decided to fund our battle against cancer it is because you believe in it. But your participation will not end here.


You have the right to know the details of our research and it is our duty to make it comprehensible to the public. Therefore, part of my group effort will be spent to keep a website in which our published data will open to discussion. You will be part of it. We don’t want you to be a passive recipient of complicated information about cancer. Already misconceptions and incorrect information have generated false hopes.  A cancer patient doesn't deserve that.
We want you become an expert and advocate for our research. We need your educated input and point of view. We need you to become a mediator in discussions between laypeople, government and scientists.
Fund our research and be part of it. Together we will re-purpose the future of cancer. 
Una parte importante del nostro lavoro e'  divulgare i risultati delle nostre ricerche al pubblico competente. Ma il cancro e' un problema di tutti, non solo di chi lo studia. Con il tuo contributo potremo realizzare una pagina web accessibile al pubblico vasto che cerchera' informazioni non necessariamente solo tecniche ma soprattutto  comprensibili.
Abbiamo assitito troppe volte a celebrazioni di approcci sedicenti curativi senza che questi abbiamo portato altro che fakse speranze. I pazienti di cancro non meritano questo. 
La tua partecipazione, il tuo sostegno rendera' gli studi sul cancro seguibili da tutti. Vogliamo che tu diventi esperto dei nostri studi. Vogliamo che tu diventi un mediatore tra cio' che gli esperti dicono con il loro linguaggio tecnico e cio' il pubblico necessita, merita e deve sapere. 

Contibuisci alla nostra ricerca con una donazione. Insieme ripenseremo  il futuro del cancro.

Research Material

What is cell proliferation and how can it be a problem...?
In a healthy tissue cells duplicate to replace other cells that have exhausted their functions. This is a very important mechanism to keep the integrity and function of any organ of a human body. Cell division results from activation of a very sophisticated signaling network, the software of a cell. Instead of on/off switches and wires, the cellular network is made of proteins and molecules that respond to external inputs (e.g. growth factors) as well as to internal instructions (e.g. DNA, RNA, and proteins) to execute programs that stimulate or arrest growth. Like musical instruments playing in a concert, activity of a protein or molecule is activated or suppressed in an harmonious and time-dependent manner to keep cell duplication under control and occurring only when really needed. 
Cancer cells escape the ""off command"". Cancer is ultimately the result of cells that uncontrollably multiply.  An expanding mass will ultimately occupy all the available space, disrupt organ integrity and impair their functions. Moreover, during their fast and furious proliferation some cancer cells can activate programs that will allow them to invade adjacent tissue and eventually migrate to distant sites in which they will continue to proliferate... indefinitely. The result is catastrophic. 
Despite the effort of a multitude of scientists and clinicians who are actively involved in fighting and or prevent cancer, death of millions of cancer patients occurs annually worldwide. A death that is too often occurs in otherwise young and healthy people poses a compelling drive for our search for new therapeutic drugs and/or new targets.

<p><strong>What is Trinity?</strong></p>
<p>Trinity is a health resort located at a castle where
people are re-brought to optimum health. This castle, surrounded by
nature in the middle of Germany, serves as a place providing an insight into
the system of holistic health. We are deliberately not using the term
""concept"" because it is more than that. Our guests shall be able to
experience health at its highest level by discovering how their bodies work.</p>
<p>Trinity is the first resort with a
holistic system for natural health, both on the national and the
international market for wellness and health. The other distinctive feature is
the implementation of a science-based nutritional program. </p>
<p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
<p>In order for a body to run at its optimum level
(positive mind, high levels of energy, long periods of focus etc.), 3 elements
must be combined: Body, Mind and Soul - or in other words - mental,
psychological and physical health. The three have to function harmoniously
together. If one of these elements is missing or neglected, all three of them
stop functioning properly. </p>
<p>If people have health problems, either temporarily or
permanently, it usually means that the body’s health system got out of balance,
to speak in easy terms. A few people manage to get back to optimum health, but
most people don’t. This is why chronic obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,
chronic back pain, headaches, fatigue (to name just a few) are so present these
days in modern society.</p>
<p>Not to say that conventional medicine can’t provide
somewhat effective, short-term solutions, but it usually focuses mainly on the
symptoms or one element or the other, not on the cause and not
the combination of all three.</p>
<p>At Trinity we bring these 3 elements together, take
the whole system into consideration and strive for sustainability.</p>
<p>Guests can book between 3-21 days and will be taught
the system of natural health. </p>
<p>They will experience an improvement in their health
while being at the castle and at the same time, they will receive a <i>step-by-step
plan</i> of how they can incorporate this system in their everyday life, so
they don’t get sick again and stay healthy for the rest of their life.</p>
<p><b>Did you
know:</b></p>
<p>We were able to set up basic financing in order to
start the project:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase of property</li>
<li>Construction/extension pool and wellness area</li>
<li>Partial refurbishment</li>
<li>Equipment and resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, medical insurance companies and tour
operators already agreed to work with us and provide customers.</p>
<p>That means the project can be undertaken and will also
promise a return.</p>
<p><b>About Us:</b></p>
<p>We are a family business. Jens, his sister Elke and
his son Mirko.</p>
<p>The idea of „Trinity“ evolved step by step over the
last decade. But with the illness of Elke with cancer, “Trinity” became the
focus of our work and studies. Elke’s third cancer surgery was the turning
point to put the system of natural health into practice. And she is the living
proof that “Trinity” works.</p>
<p>Jens Thurm:</p>
<p>Founder Jens Thurm is the living example of this
system. At age of nearly 60 he is more mobile and active than most teenagers. </p>
<p>He has studied economics in Berlin but decided in 1995
to pursue his passion for health, spa, fitness and nutrition professionally. </p>
<p>Since then he has studied the system of optimum health
intensely. Not only has he applied what he learned to his own way of living but
also helped many people reach an optimum level of health. With Trinity he wants
to give more people the opportunity to live a life of natural health, full
energy and well-being.</p>
<p>His motto: You can only be as active and happy as your
health allows you to be.</p>
<p>Mirko Thurm:</p>
<p>Mirko got his Bachelor in Business Economics, specialization
in Finance and IT, at the University of Economics and Law in Berlin. </p>
<p>Using his business acumen, he founded the organization
“Speedstudents”. Here he teaches Speed Reading techniques as well as learning
and memorizing strategies at well-known universities throughout Germany. </p>
<p>He can look back on 15 years of active experience in
the areas of fitness, athletics, soccer and swimming. Since 2009 he is also a
fitness trainer.</p>
<p>Elke Sticha:</p>
<p>Elke contributes to the company with in-depth
knowledge and experience, acquired over several decades, as a laboratory
assistant. She has special expertise in analytical methods for inorganic and
organic chemistry. In her long-term function as Staff Council President she is
well acquainted with the basics of employment law, drafting of employment
contracts and employment management.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Tanya.  I am a mom of 2.  I have been off work since January 14, 2013 due to a chronic pain issue that doctors have been unable to resolve and they have been keeping me heavily medicated to control the pain during this time.  My work provided insurance company denied my disability benefit because if I can sit I am not  considered disabled enough to them.  My doctor is far more concerned with my health and will not sign off on me returning to work in any capacity.  In addition to the constant pain and swelling of my entire left torso, shoulder, neck, arm and hand with any use (typing this hurts) I am on prescription medications which interferes with even my basic thinking and recalling if things.  This is really not good when you have kids.  I have no driver's license because it is unsafe for me to drive and I need to be driven everywhere if I go out at all.  I have missed birthdays, weddings, baby showers, and many other family functions from being in so much pain that I could not even travel there and try to sit at the events.  I have a wonderful husband who has been pulling double duty at home and work because I can barely even cook for my children some days.  He does all the cleaning, arranges all the babysitters and handles all the school stuff  because I cannot.  I have to call on friends and family constantly to take my boys on days where I cannot even get out of bed because my body has seized up so much.  My insurance company is paying for my medications to an extent but we are barely getting by on my husband's pay alone.  I had a really good job, and so far it is still there waiting for me if I can get back to it.  I miss work and my co-workers.  I am a person that actually likes my job and looked forward to going there every day.  I'm not used to feeling so incapacitated and useless to my family and others.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3> <p>We need any financial help we can get.  Since I've been off work we have drained our RRSPs, maxed out our mortgage to pay down some debt, and borrowed from almost every family member. Any money donated will be used to take care of the multitude of issues we currently are facing.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Any help would go towards giving my children more stability in the face of my chronic illness.  I have maybe a few good days a month where I can actually be a mom and go play with them, and make tons of homemade soups and sauces for the freezer as well as cookies (they never make it to the freezer lol). Also, it may actually make it where I don't feel like crying everyday for being a burden to my husband and make me feel like I am contributing in some way to helping our family again.<br/>
</div>If you cannot donate or help in any way, please repost this so others that might be able to help if they see this can.  I really appreciate any support.  I have not been through anything so humbling as reaching out for help like this except for watching my mother pass away from breast cancer after a five year battle.  I know, if she was here right now I would not be needing to post this because she would do anything for me or anyone else in need, and she taught me to be the same.<br/><div><br/></div><div>UPDATE - My lawyers have finally gotten my case filed with the Ontario Courts. The bad part is, is that it can still take a year to get through to the mediation stage.
