<p><strong>Since August 2012</strong>, I have been choreographing and directing an incredibly talented and versatile group of 9 dancers and actors- Desira Barnes, Randy Burd, Bahareh Ebrahimzadeh, Rebecca Lubart, Amy Moore, Joanna Nobbe, Santiago Venegas, Emily Vetsch and Robert Winslow.  We have had successful preview shows in NYC at Dixon Place (Nov, '12), The Center for Performance Research (Dec, '12), Mascher Co-Op Fidget Space in Philadelphia (Dec, '12). </p>
<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong> The process so far has been made possible by my innate need to create new work as well as the sheer generosity of my performers and their free time. The time has come to ask for all you art and dance theater lovers out there for your help. What we need is basic. Your donation will go toward paying for rehearsal space, as well for monetary compensation for the performers.</p>

<p>My friend Molly is a strong, intelligent, funny, caring, kind, thoughtful, creative, vibrant, and beautiful young woman.  She was diagnosed with Leukemia in September and just finished her second round of chemo.</p>
<p> Her friends rallied around her but felt like they wanted to do more beyond well wishes and beach days—like helping her family get out here from New Jersey more often, helping with some of her daily bills, and keeping her in chocolate pudding. The holidays are upon us and because Cancer at Christmas Sucks we here at Dented Can Cabaret decided to make our Christmas show, Holiday on the Rocks, a benefit to support Molly and help her get through her illness.</p>
<p>This show features three actors, 4 burlesque performers, and a show girl chorus bringing a Christmas Review that can be described as Carol Burnett and Dame Edna hosting a TV holiday special, complete with comedy, an audience participation drinking game, and your favorite holiday classics--on the rocks and with a twist.</p>
<p>Two other performances of Holiday on the Rocks will help absorb the cost of producing this show, but our main concern is the cost of the venue the night of the benefit and some of the equipment rental.</p>
<p>We’re setting the “minimum goal” pretty low so that we can receive what generosity we’re able to attract.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Since the first time I read the Pulitzer Prize winning play Anna in the Tropics by Nilo Cruz, I've been in love. Few works of literature capture the essence of a time, a place, a culture, a family, or just humanity the way this play does. In it, Cruz tells the story of a Cuban family, working in a tobacco factory in Ybor City (Tampa, Florida) in the delicate time just before the Great Depression. A new arrival, a lector from Cuba, brings with him a key to release these characters' souls, with all their insecurities and passions. That key is Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. And the lector's reading of that Russian classic will change the family's life forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, with your help, we can bring this monumental play to the Columbia stage! As an independent study through the Anthropology Department, with help from the Student Organization of Latinos and the Columbia University Forum on Cuba, our team of talented actors and creative designers are putting together a masterful production of this play, complete with live music, period costumes, and pure determination. The curtain will come up at the Glicker Milstein Theatre (Barnard) on Friday April 6th for an 8pm performance, Saturday April 7th for a 2pm performance, and that same Saturday evening for an 8pm performance.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be the first distinctly and deliberately Latino (and, by extension, Cuban) play created at Columbia. Every step of the process has been done with the support of the Latino community on campus and with a focus on creating a show that is as multi-dimensional and diverse as the entire Columbia community. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The production is a fun and exciting experiment in combining all the arts to create the richest portrayal possible of this time, place, and family.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This production will be made possible by donations from people like YOU. Because it is an independent study, the normal arts grants are unavailable to us. In addition, although we are receiving a lot of man power and advertising help from Columbia groups, we are not a recognized group ourselves and therefore do not get funding from the Columbia higher ups. So YOUR help is imperative for our success. Your donations will be used for everything from technical costs to costume pieces, making you an integral and much appreciated part of this production. Our goal is set at $750 but we can truly use all the help we can get!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a token of our gratitude for your invaluable help, we have some fun and exciting perks for you to choose from! Depending on your donation amount you can get anything from a signed poster to a Cuban dance lesson! Check out the right hand side of this page for all your amazing options. And you can always feel free to donate multiple times to get multiple perks, or donate more than the minimum for whichever perk you like.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many ways for you to help make this production of Anna in the Tropics everything it can be! Use the share buttons to tell your friends and family about us, pass around the link to your email contacts, or just talk about us! Spreading the word helps turn $1 into $1000 and we will be endlessly grateful for that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can also support us with just your physical presence by coming to see the show on April 6 &amp; 7 at the Glicker Milstein Theatre at Barnard!! Tickets will be going on sale soon and will be available through the Columbia Ticketing website or at the TIC in Lerner Hall. We hope to see you there!</p>

<p>Written by Lila Rose Kaplan</p>
<p>Directed by Sarah Rasmussen </p>
<p>A piece of chalk. Big band music. A pocketful of leaves. These clues lead Angela on a quest from her apartment on the Upper West Side to a cave in Moscow to search for someone who is missing. Inspired by the stories of Borges, BUREAU OF MISSING PERSONS is a magical tale that explores how we heal.</p>
<p>Featuring: Maren Bush, Lucy DeVito, Jason Liebman, Ryan McCarthy, and Pamela Shaw.</p>
<p>Set and Costumes By: Moria Clinton, Lighting By: Porsche McGovern, Sound By: Sam Kusnetz, Stage Manager: Kaitlin Nemeth, Creative Line Producer: Amanda Feldman </p>
<p>We are so thrilled to give BUREAU OF MISSING PERSONS it's NYC debut at The 4th Street Theatre this coming June 14th - 29th. </p>
<p>  </p>
<h2>HOW IT CAME TO BE…</h2>
<p>When I started this play it was called <em>Death of the Doily </em>and it was about a school for manners. My grandmother was dying and I couldn’t face it. When she passed, I saw how little space we have to grieve and heal right now. Everything goes so fast. The world is moving so fast that we miss people who are standing right in front of us. Suddenly, I realized I wasn’t writing about a school for manners, I was writing<em> </em>about a Bureau of Missing Persons. I imagined a place where all the people you’ve lost, a place where they go.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING A DONATION</h2>
<p>As we mention in our video, we have a wonderful-amazing-super team. We booked a beautiful, yet trendy theater to perform in, and we have already raised $23,000 out of $30,000 to put on this beautiful play, so all we need is that last $7000! </p>
<p>This $7,000 will go toward paying our creative team, rehearsal space, props, as well as for a blue scarf or two or twenty. </p>
<p>Your support would mean the world to us!</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Susanna, an apprentice with <a href=""http://inspiraciondancechi.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inspiracion Dance Chicago</a>. We are a twelve-member Latin dance company from diverse backgrounds that performs new, exciting choreography in Chicago and offers free or subsidized community education to high school, college, and adult teams. Our next project is to increase our visibility and augment our training by traveling to train and perform at the 2013 Canada Salsa Congress in Toronto! Personally, this will be my first opportunity to perform at a salsa congress, and a major step in advancing my dance career. But I need your help.</p>
<p>We need to raise about $500 each to cover the cost of registration, costumes, gas, hotel, and food. So in addition to washing cars, baking cookies, and giving paid performances, we are turning to YOU- our friends and family- for support. In exchange, we offer our thanks and a video of the performance in Toronto. Your contribution will help us step up our game, and further, contribute to the vital work of offering community dance education in Chicago. Thank you!</p>

<p> </p></div>","We need you to help raise the additional cost of producing 'Shrek the Musical' this October in West Bend, Wisconsin.  
 
Spotlight Productions has a rich history of producing family friendly musicals and comedies for 33 years in West Bend, Wisconsin.  THAT’S RIGHT - THREE DECADES.  
 
As an all volunteer company, Spotlight relies on the generosity and talent of committed individuals and families within our community. Our previous productions have been funded exclusively through our ticket sales (with our musicals helping to offset some of the costs for our Spring comedies).  The Artistic Director and Founder of the company along with almost every director in the company have a degree in Theatre, Music, or Dance.  We strive for a high standard of morality and artistic professionalism in our performances.  Of course, we also like to have a lot of fun. 
 
Spotlight Productions is all about family and community.  It is not unusual for us to have 3 generations sharing the stage or entire families involved in a production.  Some of the kids in our first productions are now coming back as parents with children of their own to make memories together. 

 
Spotlight Productions is moving to a larger theatre space that brings with it some additional challenges.   
 
 Shrek the Musical allows us the opportunity to produce a newly released musical with family oriented fun while stretching our creativity in a new theatre space.
The limitations in our previous space were primarily the low ceilings and the small footprint of the stage.  We actually built two side stages, a thrust, and (starting with the yellow brick road for the Wizard of Oz) two bridges connecting those side stages.  Even with extreme creativity, finding space for 50 or more actors to share the stage was tough and choreography for these large musical numbers was nothing short of a miracle.
This leads us to the current exciting opportunity we have before us.  Our local school district is also undergoing a major effort to revitalize the high school theatre with some pretty major fundraising.  While the fruits of their efforts are still a long way off, we have been asked to help promote their campaign by bringing a major community based production onto the high school stage to showcase the possibilities.  
Doing so will require some creativity and a lot of flexibility as we need to design all of the set pieces to move on and off the stage so that regularly scheduled school performances can go on during the run of our show.  The size of the theatre will also increase our costs for the royalties for each performance.  And then there is the issue of sound.  One of the biggest drawbacks with the current school stage is the sound . . . it is just about as horrible listening to Donkey learn to yodel or seeing Shrek floss.  We will need to double the number of microphones that we have for this production and while we have amassed quite the collection of set pieces over 33 years, almost everything we have will be lost in this space.  That means starting from scratch and that is expensive.
 
WE NEED YOU
We are very optimistic about what we can do in this new space.  Our designers are already at work coming up with ideas for set pieces, creating costumes, and finding ways to pull off some pretty spectacular special effects.  However, we are estimating that we are $5,000 to $8,000 short in our budget for this production.  Again, we have a long history of being able to cover our costs with ticket sales and we intend to go back to this in the near future. (Bottom line - we aren't setting you up for an annual appeal.)
But for this show we need you!!!  Your support will allow us to dream bigger.  If we can reach our goal we will be able to do all 6 performances the way we have imagined them.  For the 100+ people who volunteer countless hours on the creation of this project over a 3 month period  - that would be a real gift.  With your help our set and costume designers can really spread their wings (literally in the case of creating Dragon) and show an audience how theatre can truly transform the ordinary into something magical.  You will also let Grandma and Grandpa hear how wonderful their grandkids sound.
 
HOW YOU CAN HELP


We would love to have you come out for the show.  Live theatre is nothing without an audience to appreciate it.  Performance Dates:   October 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 at the West Bend High School Theatre.


Donate - if you have $5 or $500 the support you give will make an OGRE sized impact on our show.  We had fun coming up with our perks to the right - check them out.

Our members work nationally and internationally in all areas of the entertainment industry.                    Twice a year we invite the public to staged readings of the best works of the seasonin our Spring Reading Series and WinterWorks.We would now like to take the next step: presenting fully mounted Equity Showcase productions of the best works developed at ARTC. While maintaining our weekly workshops, we feel it is vitally important to provide this additional opportunity for our members to fully realize their work.  We hope you share our enthusiasm for a producing ARTC and will help us make it a reality with your fully tax-deductible donation.This June, with your generous help, ARTC will proudly present the New York premier of Stuart D'Ver's Kallie, the 2013 winner of the Jerry Kaufman award.Set in the mind of the central character, Kallie is an exploration of memory wrapped in a pitch black comedy about delusion, reality -- and Groucho Marx. It is the tale of a young woman escaping an abusive relationship who rebels against her abuser, rebels against the drugs that have kept her in check, and rebels against the memories of her own past. The daughter of a successful Philadelphia surgeon, Kallie is a child of privilege. Yet, she is obsessed with delusions -- roaches who read her mind, rats who invade her body -- which have kept her enslaved to deadbeat lovers and dead end jobs. After a particularly vicious argument with her boyfriend, Kallie flees and embarks on an hallucinatory train trip to find her Dad and escape her inner demons. Along the way, she struggles with deviations from reality that are sometimes disconcerting, sometimes insane and sometimes insanely funny. Darkly surreal -- deeply comic -- Kallie is the story of one woman's journey from madness to love.Stuart D'Ver's plays have been presented in New York at the Abingdon Theatre The Last Time, Sunny Climes, the Neighborhood Playhouse Feeling With Food, Circumstance, the Turtle Shell Clearing The Air, and the Estrogenius Festival Ladies of the Lake. The American Aunt,1929 won the 2008 Raymond J. Flores Award. Kallie was short-listed for the O'Neill Conference, was a finalist for the Episcopal Actors Guild's Thomas Barbour Award, and won the 2013 Jerry Kaufman Award.

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>We're a group of five young theatre artists in Montreal Quebec who are taking our debut production on a Spring and Summer tour across Canada. We're passionate about producing exciting new Canadian plays that are quick and easily produced without the heavy technical artifice of modern conventional theatre. We focus on the foundations of good theatre, text, actors, and audience without stressing extraneous production elements.</p>
All five members of our production team studied together in the Theatre program at Concordia University in Montreal. Our group first came together to produce Third Person as part of Concordia's Student Initiated Production Assignments (SIPA) Festival in November 2011, and it was enthusiastically received by the sold-out crowds at our small venue. However, this taste of success encouraged us to take our work to a much larger audience, and the notion of a cross-Canada tour was born! </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our Company consists of:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Brandon Wicke - Playwright/Director</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kevin Ray - George</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nic Turcotte - Byron</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Veronica Derby - Designer</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Megan Holt - Stage Manager</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We're Up To:</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%;"">Written by our Director, Brandon Wicke, during his time at Concordia University, Third Person tells the story of two young men, George and Byron, who find themselves in a strange clearing where mysterious text continually haunts them with predictions of their future and promises of universal knowledge. Camping out with only their tent and flashlight, the two must decide whether or not to trust in the writing's authority to dole out their fate, and perhaps even discover what true part they as human beings have in determining their own future. The writing refuses to make this pursuit easy on them however, making attempts to pit the two against one another and preying on their individual fears and anxieties until the two must make a choice whether to heed the antagonistic force's claims despite its questionable motives, or to turn their backs on it forever and leave still in ignorance as to the true nature of fate.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So far, we'll be bringing Third Person to:</div>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where Your Money Will Go:</h3>
<p>While we stress the importance of creating affordable and pared-down theatre, there are a number of expenses associated with our tour. Our Indiegogo campaign is aimed particularly at the purchase of a high quality video projector which is the backbone of our production's design. While we have explored renting projectors for each of our different performances, we believe that, due to projection's importance to our play, it is in our best interest to purchase our own and rehearse with it from the beginning of the tour. This will also allow us to use projection in future productions without further expense.</p>
<p><br/>Our current list of expenses for the tour is as follows:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Montreal Fringe Application Fee: $57.49 </strong> </p>
<p><strong>Montreal Fringe Participant Fee: $546.14</strong></p>
<p><strong>SpringWorks Festival  Application Fee: $35.00<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Toronto Venue Rental Fees: estimated <span class=""notranslate""><strong>$625.00 </strong></span><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class=""notranslate""><strong>Vancouver Fringe Participant Fee: $ 750.00<br/></strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class=""notranslate""><strong>Transportation to Vancouver: $3750.00 (economy flights for 5 cast &amp; crew)<br/></strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class=""notranslate""><strong>Purchase of Video Projector: $1500 (taxes included)<br/></strong></span></strong></p>

<h2>PROFILE</h2>
<p>My name is Amy Trompetter, and I am a puppeteer from NY.  I am raising airfare to fly to Jakarta to support three young, activist theater companies.</p>
<h3>HOW DID THIS BEGIN?</h3>
<p>Recently I collaborated with Thai and Burmese actors and puppeteers at Empty Space Chiang Mai and Gitameit Music Centers Yangon and Mandalay.  The video clip shows the mix of delicate traditional marionettes of Htwe Oo Myanmar and crude large-scale free-form masks inspired by work with the Bread and Puppet and Redwing Blackbird Theaters. That collaboration, ""The Four Puppets"" was featured at a Burmese contemporary theater festival in Yangon, and welcomed for its iconoclastic mix. </p>
<h3>WHAT CAME NEXT?</h3>
<p>I toured Burma in 2011 with a large scale puppet/new music piece.  Now I have been invited to travel to Jakarta to join the three young theater companies from Burma, Indonesia and Thailand for the second phase of their project, UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN. The name, given by Empty Space director Manuel Lutgenhorst, refers to moving out from under artistic repression in the three countries.  Company members develop theatrical images and metaphors that cloak experience to ignite response, as politics and policies shift between dictatorships, autocracies and democracies. See Taring Padi video clip from phase one of UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XvP2YHYMtI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XvP2YHYMtI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a> <span id=""parent-fieldname-description-66b1ad04-176f-4ed2-9e87-2cfa7f1c02df""></span></p>
<h3>WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?</h3>
<p>Thukama Khayee Thee, Taring Padi and Makhampom theater companies are meeting from Septmeber 8-23 in Yoyakarta to show each other recent works. They are also collaborating on a new piece about Kulan Progo farmers, on <span id=""parent-fieldname-description-66b1ad04-176f-4ed2-9e87-2cfa7f1c02df"">Java's South Coast, who are resisting the</span> iron mining company's threats to usurp land cultivated by families for generations.  The goals of the project are to visit these farmers, create new works using music, theater, graphics and puppetry, and to finally bring new approaches to theater back to communities at home.</p>
<h3> WHERE DOES IT LEAD?</h3>
<p>While in each other's company in Yogyakarta, we can plan future projects.  UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN is preparing for a third phase in Burma in 2013.  And I am developing a new project that begins with migrant workers, temporarily living in Yangon, and continues in their home villages in Shan State Hill Tribe areas of Burma in 2014.  The solidarity of our struggle is especially important as Burma opens up.</p>
<h3> WHAT DO WE NEED?</h3>
<p>Goethe Society and Open Space Institute generously provided funding for the UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN project and travel expenses for participants from Southeast Asia.  Recently invited, I am raising my own travel money of $2500.  This covers air fare and expenses from NY to Jakarta and then to Yogyakarta and back. </p>
<h3>WHAT DO YOU GET?</h3>
<p>Each donor can use this link <a href=""http://www.ustream.tv/channel/emptyspacechiangmai"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ustream.tv/channel/emptyspacechiangmai</a> to follow a live feed of our project.  This feed will be available, as possible, onsite during the worshop and performances in Indonesia, and as a permanent archive thereafter.  Empty Space director, Manuel Lutgenhorst, has promised to edit footage of the project and to put together a DVD and a booklet with text and photos of the process and final piece. If you cannot donate and are interested, follow the project on the link above or contact <a href=""mailto:amy.trompetter@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">amy.trompetter@gmail.com. </a> I am happy to send relevant updates as our work progresses.  And please spread the word about this campaign.  Thank you!</p>

I toured Burma in 2011 with a large scale puppet/new music piece.  Now I have been invited to travel to Jakarta to join the three young theater companies from Burma, Indonesia and Thailand for the second phase of their project, UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN. The name, given by Empty Space director Manuel Lutgenhorst, refers to moving out from under artistic repression in the three countries.  Company members develop theatrical images and metaphors that cloak experience to ignite response, as politics and policies shift between dictatorships, autocracies and democracies. See Taring Padi video clip from phase one of UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XvP2YHYMtI&feature=youtube_gdata_player 
WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
Thukama Khayee Thee, Taring Padi and Makhampom theater companies are meeting from Septmeber 8-23 in Yoyakarta to show each other recent works. They are also collaborating on a new piece about Kulan Progo farmers, on Java's South Coast, who are resisting the iron mining company's threats to usurp land cultivated by families for generations.  The goals of the project are to visit these farmers, create new works using music, theater, graphics and puppetry, and to finally bring new approaches to theater back to communities at home.
 WHERE DOES IT LEAD?
While in each other's company in Yogyakarta, we can plan future projects.  UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN is preparing for a third phase in Burma in 2013.  And I am developing a new project that begins with migrant workers, temporarily living in Yangon, and continues in their home villages in Shan State Hill Tribe areas of Burma in 2014.  The solidarity of our struggle is especially important as Burma opens up.
 WHAT DO WE NEED?
Goethe Society and Open Space Institute generously provided funding for the UNDER AFTER and IN BETWEEN project and travel expenses for participants from Southeast Asia.  Recently invited, I am raising my own travel money of $2500.  This covers air fare and expenses from NY to Jakarta and then to Yogyakarta and back. 
WHAT DO YOU GET?
Each donor can use this link http://www.ustream.tv/channel/emptyspacechiangmai to follow a live feed of our project.  This feed will be available, as possible, onsite during the worshop and performances in Indonesia, and as a permanent archive thereafter.  Empty Space director, Manuel Lutgenhorst, has promised to edit footage of the project and to put together a DVD and a booklet with text and photos of the process and final piece. If you cannot donate and are interested, follow the project on the link above or contact amy.trompetter@gmail.com.  I am happy to send relevant updates as our work progresses.  And please spread the word about this campaign.  Thank you!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Work in Progress Productions, dedicated to encouraging young people to participate in the performing and creative arts while entertaining our community.</p>
<p>The Longwood area, where we rehearse and perform, is vast and full of many talented young people who lack opportunities. This show, like all our others over the past 9 years, is intended to <strong>bring the arts to a community that desperately needs it.</strong> This year, we want to go for ""all the marbles"" and become a recognized non-profit company.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need <strong>at least $5000</strong> to pay the fees associated with becoming a non-profit. We hope you will decide to pledge any amount, and check out our fabulous prizes such as signed posters, unique artwork, and even a pianist for a night!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Last year, we had a successful campaign just to raise money to build a set for a show. This year, our campaign is a little more far-reaching. We want this group to keep on nourishing the talent of young people in our community, and having the official non-profit status is a huge step towards longevity. Our church home (Middle Island Presbyterian Church) will be more willing to host us, which is a big deal, too. The reason this group has happened for the past nine years is that it impacts the young people; they want to do this, they want to have something to fill their summer and keep them active, they want to be a part of something. <strong>Non-profit status will solidify our place and our goals in the community.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>Even if you can't pledge at least $1, you can still help! Share our campaign with everyone you know! And come see our show at the end of July: SURE THINGS, a collection of one-act comedies by Christopher Durang and David Ives, directed by Evan Muthig and Victoria Shure, produced by Evan Muthig and Kevin Story, featuring 11 talented young actors.</div>

WHAT IS THIS?
Stranger Things is a new world premiere production by The Ghost Road Company directed by ensemble member Ronnie Clark.  Inspired by the works and ideas of existential philosopher Albert Camus, this musical play examines self-identity, loyalty and the choices we make to survive.  A domestic tragedy set in a desolate rural area far up North, Stranger Things features original music by David O. As it delves into the emotional undercurrent of isolated individuals, the play investigates how our relationships to others, or lack thereof, define us.

WHERE IS THIS?
Stranger Things has been invited to be a part of the Ko Festival in Amherst, Massachusetts.  For over 20 years, KoFest has been presenting “original works that surprise, provoke and inspire,” and Stranger Things is a perfect addition to this year’s festival theme of “Secrets.”  We will be performing the play on August 5-7, 2011.

WHY THIS?
The Ghost Road Company has covered two years worth of developmental fees for this production in addition to arranging for all the artists’ travel.  Your support will help us pay the design fees and expenses, mount two Sneak Peek performances here in Los Angeles prior to Ko, and pay for the shipping expenses associated with getting the scenic pieces to Massachusetts.  In addition to the perks we are offering for your help, The Ghost Road Company is a 501(c)3 so your donation is 100% tax deductible.

The Ghost Road Company is a small group of year-long working theatre artists.  We stay so busy creating new theatre that we often don’t have enough time to spread the word about our projects.  You can help without going out-of-pocket by sharing this link with your friends and/or posting it to your facebook page.  The Ghost Road Company always accepts in-kind donations of any items you might have to get rid of that you think a theatre company could use.  And you’d be surprised at the uses we can find for things.  Our last production made use of about 30 nearly destroyed old suitcases!  To arrange in-kind donations, simply email us at info@ghostroad.org.  Thank you!!!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><em>Invitations/Into/Traces (or) all i want to do is invent a machine which creates surprises</em></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am making a piece</strong> for Summerworks called <em>Invitations/Into/Traces (or) all i want to do is invent a machine which creates surprises</em>. This movement-based performance looks at embodied audience-performer relationships, mapping the traces of those happenings and<strong> being where we are.</strong></p>
<p>The Summerworks Theatre Festival is<strong> Canada's largest juried theatre festival</strong> and runs from August 9th -19th in Toronto. <em>Invitations/Into/Traces</em> is one of the only dance/movement pieces invited to perform in this year's festival and it is one of three pieces chosen as an 'off-site' work.</p>
<p>An excerpt of this piece debuted at the Bad-Ass Mini Dance Fest at the Harbourfront Centre earlier this March and was also performed at this year's Summerworks Launch Party. The piece performed in August will be a full length version of what what was started at the Bad-Ass festival and will be <strong>performed at the Gladstone Hotel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lisa Conway</strong> has been commissioned to create the music score, <strong>Julia Sasso</strong> has been brought on as mentor/outside eye and <strong>Layne Hinton</strong> has been collaborating on technical/installation elements. A <strong>zine </strong>titled <em>The Dictionary of Difficult Things</em> is being developed to accompany the show with the help of Natalie Boustead. <strong>I am also working closely with you (the audience)</strong> but you didn't know that until you read it just now.</p>

<h3><strong>Impact of Support</strong></h3>
<p>If you assist with the creation of this work, you will be supporting the <strong>development and definition of what Canadian contemporary dance is and what it can be.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And we need you...</strong></p>
<p>Participating in theatre festivals awards many benefits to artists and companies, including a broad audience reach, support from seasoned festival staff, and the opportunity to meet and learn from other contemporary artists and companies. That being said, it can be difficult for small, independent companies to earn back their production costs in ticket revenue alone, as the festival takes a significant cut of the ticket price. That's where fundraising comes in.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""color: #4d4d4d; font-family: Verdana;"">Capoeira Angola, an ancient martial art of African origin, is one of the many cultural weapons used to break the chains of enslavement in Brazil. Played close to the ground, Capoeira Angola combines fluid, dance-like movements with kicks, head butts, tripping sweeps and the appearance of playfulness or vulnerability. Music is played on traditional instruments to accompany the players, to teach the rhythmic heart of the art, and also to mask its power. In the eyes of the enslavers it appeared to be a playful acrobatic dance. Eventually its power was realized and Capoeira was outlawed. Death was the penalty paid by those caught playing Capoeira during the time of slavery. For almost 400 years Capoeira Angola was taught and practiced in secret, only in the 1930's did this African martial art become legal to teach and practice.</span></p>

<p>The story is a modern day myth. The Creator places two perfect souls on the Earth at its inception and sets the Earth turning, promising that on the day those two souls unite, the Earth will come to an end. Fearing this end, the Earth keeps the two lovers apart for 30,000 lifetimes, but slowly learns the weariness of eternal life. At the start of our story, the two lovers, Ilsa and Simon, are in their thirty thousandth and first lifetime, and they show the signs of their souls’ extreme old age. The Earth, in agony from the weariness of continuing to turn and weighted down by humanity, calls out to the Creator to help bring Ilsa and Simon together. The Creator, by revealing to Ilsa and Simon their destiny, pushes the two souls into an epic quest across the Earth to find each other and unknowingly bring about the end of the world.</p>
<p>This piece explores the plight of the romantic in a world of cynics, the dreamers who hold on to a fantastical idea despite all odds. It also explores the suffering of the Earth at the hands of humanity, and the idea of death as an act of compassion.</p>
<p><em>Thirty Thousand One </em>utilizes both worlds of dialogue and dance to their fullest extent. This piece also seeks to contrast the heightened expansiveness of the dance and original music of the story with 21st century characters and colloquial dialogue, thus highlighting that the fantastical can happen even now, in our own time.</p>

We will share my newest work<strong> <em>ALL what THIS do HAS you HAPPENED see BEFORE.</em></strong> The work delves into my fascination with perception, perspective and memory and how we have to ""know"" what we ""see"" as well as our desire to remember what has happened before and how it changes as we remember it. It's a wonderful opportunity for me as artist to share my work with an international audience, arts presenters from Europe, and the chance for a residency next summer in Spoleto. It is an honor as I am the only US dance company on the program as well as a decades long dream to show my own work in Europe. I have been a performing artist in the work of other great artists for many years, but now is my opportunity to take the next step in my career as a dance-maker. And you can help make this happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The festival gives us the theater and press to perform as well as assistance with accomodations, however it is up to me to get us there. Thgis is where I need your help. The airfare is $1044.00 for each of us, with 6 of us needing to get to the festival. This is where you can help me make this dream opportunity a reality! I have raised $1900.00 so far but my total airfare is $6264.00. That's why you can help me with getting one of my dancers to Spoleto. Each and every dollars is greatly appreciated, no amount is too small (or too large!). </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""3"">Our musical <i>Lightning Man</i> began at the Tisch Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program. Our first draft started as a collection of songs with Jeff writing the music and Shoshana, Katya and Janet writing lyrics. The songs were loosely inspired by Roy Sullivan, a man who in real life survived 7 lightning strikes! The character of Lightning came to life in the shape of 3 seductive and dangerous women. A few months ago, Maggie-Kate joined our team as the bookwriter. We now have two fantastic opportunities to continue the development of our show.  <i>Lightning Man</i> was selected to be part of the 2011 ANT Fest at Ars Nova this October, and we’re also planning a reading of our newly revised show at Primary Stages this winter.  We’re thrilled with both of these opportunities, and we need your help!</font></p>

</h3><p style=""""><font color=""#000000""><font size=""+0""><font size=""3"">If we are able to purchase a tour bus, we will be able to continue to grow as a team and reach a much wider audience, therefore impacting more people across the country.

While many large events ask us to perform and provide transportation costs, we foot the cost to take our show to schools and small community type events and with travel costs so high we have to turn down many of the smaller ones including many that we would donate our time to but can't get to because of the costs involved.</font><font size=""3"">This bus will allow us to avoid renting one and getting motel rooms each trip thus allowing us to accept more invitations from schools and community events and to reach out and introduce more youth and people of all ages to the love and art of country dance.

We are The Country Dance World Champions The Chili Chicks dance team, we are a community orientated team made up of professional women of all ages and backgrounds. From college students to professional dance instructors, we range in age from eighteen to forty plus and come to the team with everything from no dance experience to pro level resumes. The Chili Chicks provide great family friendly performances that are crowd pleasing and interactive. We are literally “the girls next door”, and we take great pride in providing entertainment for the entire family.
We need an entry level tour bus so we can travel more cost effectively across the country and reach more friends and fans from coast to coast, spreading the love and entertainment of country dance. 
WHY YOU SHOULD CARE

If we are able to purchase a tour bus, we will be able to continue to grow as a team and reach a much wider audience, therefore impacting more people across the country. We have outgrown our current resources that allow us to travel to various events, and it is time to take the next step in order to grow to the next level. While many large events ask us to perform and provide transportation costs, we foot the cost to take our show to schools and small community type events and with travel costs so high we have to turn down many of the smaller ones including many that we would donate our time to but can't get to because of the costs involved.This bus will allow us to avoid renting one and getting motel rooms each trip thus allowing us to accept more invitations from schools and community events and to reach out and introduce more youth and people of all ages to the love and art of country dance. We can’t reach them all, but we can reach out to those we can get to.
 WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET

We only need $15,000 more to get an entry level tour bus. There are many costs associated with Team travel and having our own bus will help us to do away with having to get motel rooms and renting a bus/R.V for every trip. This will also allow us to do more events that don't have the budget to cover our current travel expenses but who would really like us to perform for them. If you are able to help us reach this goal in any way, we would really appreciate it and along with our appreciation we'd like to give you some great thank you gifts as well! We have a lot of exciting events in the upcoming months and years that we hope to attend and would love for you to be a part of it! Thank you!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Jessica Miller Tomlinson is a professional dancer and choreographer who is actively working in the Chicago dance community. As a young choreographer I have made it a personal goal to challenge myself to create a body of work that is recognizable as my own but also varies in style, range of perspective and that shows versatility as an artist. My hope is to innovate without self-consciousness and to be new and new again, to have the ability to lead an audience effortlessly from beginning to end no matter how imaginative the journey between. As an active member of the Chicago dance community, I feel a responsibility to help maintain a sense of culture in order to preserve the performing arts. My professional choreographic career was elevated to a new level with the Grand Prize Win at The A.W.A.R.D. Show! 2009:Chicago. Since receiving this grant from The Joyce Theater Foundation, I have been taking on various projects to help further the community in Chicago and other independent artists like myself. For Instance, in June 2010 I self produced a full-length choreographic showcase that presented an eclectic mix of dance professionals from the community. In addition, I have combined forces with other organizations such as: Chicago based musicians District 97, The Fashion Department of the Merchandise Mart, Dance For Life, The Dance Center of Columbia College and am currently working on a joint venture with colleague Jacqueline Stewart entitled ""Dance Gallery"". In March of 2011 I will be presenting a concert with Chicago artists Winifred Haun and Dancers and Jacqueline Stewart. I am extremely honored to be presenting work at The Joyce SoHo this June as part of The A.W.A.R.D. Show !All-Stars. I am trying to raise money for this trip to NYC so that I can reimburse my in incredible dancers for endless hours of rehearsal, and dedication to my passion. <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This trip to NYC to perform at The Joyce SoHo will have such a positive impact on my career as a young, independent choreographer. It is rare that you receive opportunities like this one and I am so grateful and want to use this trip as an opportunity to help spread my name and work to a broader audience base. Not only will this trip benefit myself as a choreographer but it will also help my amazing dancers to further their own careers. Going to NYC is such a great opportunity to network with other dance professionals. I feel I owe it to my dancers to make this trip a success, because of the endless hours in the studio and the dedication to my passion and artistic visions. This is the only source of funding which I have for this project other than my own wallet and that of my incredible husband who as a fellow artist,  whole-heartedly supports my visions. The support for this campaign will help make this trip to NYC a successful venture for myself and my dancers and let us rest assured that we will be able to eat, sleep and dance safely and to the best of our abilities. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I am hoping to raise $500 for this campaign. The money raised will go directly to my incredible dancers. Mollie, Jackie, Brian and Jeremy have all put in countless hours of blood, sweat and tears to make my choreographic visions a reality and I owe them the world, but as a fellow dancer, understand the importance of a paycheck regardless of the amount. Having this funding will make it easier for all of my dancers and I to have an enjoyable, successful trip to NYC. In return for your support, you not only will receive my undying gratification, but I will personally send you a thank you card signed by myself and my dancers, which includes a series of photos from our trip to NYC to perform at The Joyce SoHo. <br/><br/>

<p>---¿POR QUÉ?---</p>
<p>Este
proyecto surge a raíz de una necesidad, la de expresar la lucha a la que se
someten los artistas a la hora de trabajar en cualquiera de sus disciplinas.</p>
<p>¿Por qué
Cabaret?</p>
<p>Decidimos
hacer este tipo de espectáculo, para poder romper con las reglas y ponernos a
prueba  a nosotras mismas. Esta disciplina permite utilizar tanto el baile, como el canto, como la interpretación y es también
una herramienta idónea para la crítica social.</p>
<p>¿Por qué
Rock?</p>
<p>Utilizamos
míticas canciones de rock de los 80´, queríamos rescatarlas , evadirnos de la
actualidad tecno-pop y usar estos clásicos tan conocidos,  versionándolos con un estilo que concuerda a
la perfección con el espectáculo.</p>
<p>¿Por qué
Show?</p>
<p>Porque es para
todos los públicos, con música en vivo, en clave de humor y porque en los tiempos
que corren hay que tratar de que el espectador desconecte de sus realidades y
pasen un rato agradable y divertido en el teatro.</p>
<p><b>REHAB, Cabaret Rock Show</b>, no es un concierto de música, no es
una obra de teatro, no es un espectáculo de danza, es todo eso y mucho más, es
un cóctel explosivo que romperá los esquemas de todo aquel que se atreva a
adentrarse en un mundo donde no sabrá distinguir la realidad de la ficción.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>---SINOPSIS---</p>
<p>Una escuela de rehabilitación, REHAB (Real Escuela de Hábitos Artísticos Básicos)</p>
<p>Carlota, actriz, no ejerce, se inscribe en la REHAB buscando otro MÉTODO para hacerse un hueco en el mundo de la interpretación, el sueño de su vida. <br/>Elsa y Lucía, afincadas y resignadas alumnas, se encargaran de mostrarle la realidad de esta escuela tan peculiar.</p>
<p>""Aquí se enseñan otro tipo de técnicas y métodos"" <br/>""hay que explotar otras cualidades"" <br/>""investigar en otros campos""</p>
<p>'La Tresena en discordia' nos ofrece un espectáculo en clave de rock .<br/>Un cabaret que incluye danza, teatro y música en directo.<br/>Una crítica hacia el ""mundillo"" al que se ven obligados los artistas a pertenecer para poder hacer de su sueño una profesión.</p>
<br/>
</div><div>---LA COMPAÑÍA---</div>'La Tresena en discordia' somos una nueva compañía formada por tres jóvenes actrices residentes en Madrid Las tres juntas nos diplomamos en Réplika Teatro cursando   teatro, danza y canto.

</div></div>","---¿POR QUÉ?---
Este
proyecto surge a raíz de una necesidad, la de expresar la lucha a la que se
someten los artistas a la hora de trabajar en cualquiera de sus disciplinas.
¿Por qué
Cabaret?
Decidimos
hacer este tipo de espectáculo, para poder romper con las reglas y ponernos a
prueba  a nosotras mismas. Esta disciplina permite utilizar tanto el baile, como el canto, como la interpretación y es también
una herramienta idónea para la crítica social.
¿Por qué
Rock?
Utilizamos
míticas canciones de rock de los 80´, queríamos rescatarlas , evadirnos de la
actualidad tecno-pop y usar estos clásicos tan conocidos,  versionándolos con un estilo que concuerda a
la perfección con el espectáculo.
¿Por qué
Show?
Porque es para
todos los públicos, con música en vivo, en clave de humor y porque en los tiempos
que corren hay que tratar de que el espectador desconecte de sus realidades y
pasen un rato agradable y divertido en el teatro.
REHAB, Cabaret Rock Show, no es un concierto de música, no es
una obra de teatro, no es un espectáculo de danza, es todo eso y mucho más, es
un cóctel explosivo que romperá los esquemas de todo aquel que se atreva a
adentrarse en un mundo donde no sabrá distinguir la realidad de la ficción.

---SINOPSIS---
Una escuela de rehabilitación, REHAB (Real Escuela de Hábitos Artísticos Básicos)
Carlota, actriz, no ejerce, se inscribe en la REHAB buscando otro MÉTODO para hacerse un hueco en el mundo de la interpretación, el sueño de su vida. Elsa y Lucía, afincadas y resignadas alumnas, se encargaran de mostrarle la realidad de esta escuela tan peculiar.
""Aquí se enseñan otro tipo de técnicas y métodos"" ""hay que explotar otras cualidades"" ""investigar en otros campos""
'La Tresena en discordia' nos ofrece un espectáculo en clave de rock .Un cabaret que incluye danza, teatro y música en directo.Una crítica hacia el ""mundillo"" al que se ven obligados los artistas a pertenecer para poder hacer de su sueño una profesión.

teaching local Sonoma Valley (for now anyway) elementary and middle school kids
spinning skills. <br/></p><p>In short, <br/></p><p>We are seeking financial help to buy poi
equipment and other supplies so that our young poi spinners can have what they
need to create a performance in the Spring of 2014. <br/></p><p>     Learning and performing the
very ancient and fascinating art of spinning helps these kids enhance their
self-esteem through mastery of a creative art, develop cooperation and social
skills, and keep them out of trouble. Because all of the equipment purchased
will be retained by Illumini Arts for use in our future programs, your
contribution will benefit local kids well beyond this Spring’s training classes
and performance.</p>
<h4>Illumini Arts—What we do…</h4>
<p>     We are a poi and
spinning collective based in Sonoma, California. Since 2012, we have been
volunteering at local schools and their after school programs, teaching local
elementary and middle school children the ancient art of poi. Our classes are focused on a short performance that demonstrates what the kids have learned. This helps to keep them motivated and excited about
increasing and enhancing their performance skills. It is truly inspiring and
heart-warming to see the pride of the kids, as they learn to master complex
moves, as well as working together in a team to create a few moments of magic
for their peers, their parents, and interested members of the community. For
some of these children, poi may be the only thing they have ever felt true
mastery over and received praise and admiration for. We believe their enhanced
self-esteem will certainly spill over into their academic and social life, and
hopefully keep them from pursuing other less productive or socially
unacceptable ways of spending their time. Because we are already working in the
schools and with other after school programs, we have seen the demand and interest, and are confident of the positive impact this work is making in the lives of
our local children.</p>
<h4>Our Campaign—How you can help…</h4>
<p>     We are reaching out
to our local community and the poi community to take our existing program to a
new and higher level. With the money we raise, we will purchase LED poi sets, a
small PA system, practice poi, t-shirts for the kids, and storage cases to keep
the equipment secure. Although we are currently seeking to use this equipment for a
Spring 2014 performance, we intend to keep teaching and training using this
equipment to involve more and more children in the future. Your contribution
will have a long-lasting affect in our community. A small part of the funds
(about $700) will also pay for our website hosting for 2014, to inform the community
about the training and learning opportunities, mileage and other minimal
reimbursements to our teachers for miscellaneous expenses, and of course the
indie gogo fee. If the entire goal is not reached, our first priority will be to
use any funds raised to purchase the equipment. We have budgeted for 20
children, but if the funds aren’t there, we can scale back to 15 or 10.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>If You Can’t Contribute Money—We welcome your support…</h4>
<p>     If you are a member
of the spinning community, please help us spread the word. Tell your friends
about us. Send them our link (see above). Copy what we are doing in your local
schools and community. If you are interested in youth and education in the
Sonoma Valley, please tell your friends, family and neighbors about our
project. Encourage children you know to join our after school enrichment programs.
Invite us to participate at your child’s school. Support the kids by coming to
one of our performances. Send us positive thoughts and good wishes. Use the
SHARE tools above to tweet about our campaign or let your Facebook friends know
about our worthy cause. We humbly thank you!</p><p></p></div>","My name is Anthony Schaus, head spinner at Illumini Arts, a fire-spinning and performance collective with a special interest in

<p>is a new play by me, <a href=""http://www.amyvirginia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amy Virginia Buchanan</a><a href=""http://www.amyvirginia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>
<p>that will be going to <a href=""http://www.penascotheatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Penasco Theatre</a> in New Mexico in June to be featured in their Summer Season</p>
<p>and then will be brought back to Brooklyn to be performed at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cloudcitybk?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cloud City</a> in August!</p>
<p>By contributing, you will be helping us fly members of our company across the country to create On Fonts and then funding the transformation of space through design at Cloud City.</p>
<p>On Fonts is a play about property and permission in relation to our physical selves. In a world a little colder and much stranger than our own, a girl meets a boy and they grow together. Space and property is built up using words first, but then the question arises, “What happens when we run out of words?” Property moves from the linguistic realm to something a little more physical and things get interesting.</p>
<p>I began writing this piece while studying clown at Dell’Arte International School of Physical Theatre. I was drawn to the relationship a clown develops with an audience and the intense vulnerability a clown possesses, which allows him to broach difficult and weighty subjects with ease. I also fell in love with the collaborative process, enjoying taking a text or an idea and then building it with many different voices and bodies contributing. On Fonts is an unfinished script, in that I have written something that will shift and change as we develop the play together. When On Fonts was complete, I met with Claire Moodey  to ask her to direct and together, we have gathered the most amazing team of artists to help build this play. So, how’s about you take a moment to meet them?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://clairemoodey.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Claire Moodey</a> (director)</strong> is a Brooklyn-based theater artist with a B.A. from Bard College. As a director/writer/designer, she has created <em>Spectral Findings</em> and <em>&lt;the invisible draft&gt;</em> as well as several short pieces which have been shown throughout New York City. Her collaboration with Lotte Marie Allen for video on <em>&lt;the invisible draft&gt;</em> was awarded the Overall Excellence in video design at the New York City Fringe Festival in 2012. As a puppeteer, she has created and performed with Bread and Puppet Theater, Adhesive Theater Project, Alphabet Arts, the OWS Puppetry Guild, as well as for her original works. As an actor and singer, she has performed with EGG and Target Margin Theater’s Russian Futurist Lab, among others. Her recent work on <em>The Service Road</em> was lauded by the <em>NYTimes</em> “brilliantly jagged”. She is currently editing on an episode of Penny Arcade’s Lower East Side Biography Project featuring Richard Foreman.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://tugboatcollective.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joseph Wolfslau</a> (scenic, costume, prop, and sound design) </strong>is a set, sound, and costume designer based in New York City.  Recent designs include sound for TAPE (Strasberg Institute), sound for Clown Bar (Pipeline Theater Company), sound for #ReganCross (Theater Row), set, props, and costumes for Moon &amp; Marble (Tugboat Collective), sound for Telemachus, Darling (HITS), set and costumes for The What Dance (Target Margin/Tugboat Collective), sound for 4 Sustenance (The Movement Theater Company), sound for The Rub (Hole in the Sky), costumes for Our Town (The New School), sound for The Good Person of Szechwan (Columbia), costumes for Ghost in the Machine (Dead Copycats), set, sound, and costumes for Harm’s Way (Philaletheus Society), sound for The Seagull (Lake Lucille), and sound for P.S. It’s Poison (Panic).</p>
<p><strong>Serena Wong (lighting design)</strong> is a free lance lighting designer based in Brooklyn. She is delighted to be a part of this valiant production team, and to have found a play that mixes her love of typefaces and theatre.<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Samantha Wiener (assistant designer) </strong> is a Wig Maker and Off-Broadway Wig Supervisor in NYC.  She builds wigs for Tom Watson and Charles Lapointe for shows like Annie, Motown, Jersey Boys, Wicked, Bring It On the Musical, and Superman. She has been a Wig Supervisor on Hurt Village, February House, Soul Doctor, and All In The Timing; NYC: The Juiliiard School, The Metropolitan Opera, Signature Theatre Company, The Public Theatre, New York Theatre Workshop, Primary Stages; Regional: Wiliamstown, Santa Fe Opera, Alley Theatre</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>E. James Ford (actor)</strong> is a performer, writer, designer, and programmer based in NYC. He is a graduate of NYU’s Experimental Theatre Wing and Circle in the Square Theatre School. For 10 years he was a member of the clowning ensemble Six Characters, which he helped establish. The group toured nationally and received critical acclaim for its anarchic brand of physical comedy. Mr. Ford has performed in regional theatre and abroad, but the bulk of his theatre work has been in NYC where he has worked with some of the best and brightest minds in avant-gardde theatre including SITI Company, Richard Foreman’s Ontological/Hysteric Theatre, Mummenschanz, Title:Point Productions, Synaesthetic Theatre, Fulya Pekar, and Jeff Stark. On the web, Mr. Ford has appeared in the hit Sci-Fi web series Pioneer One, which won the award for Best New Drama at the NY International TV Festival and the Academy of Web Television Awards. In his non-actor life, he has served as the Director of Member Services for Fractured Atlas.</p>
<p><strong>Milo Cramer (actor) </strong>is a theater artist living in Brooklyn. Milo is a founding member of theater groups <a href=""http://newsaloon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NEW SALOON</a>, with roommates Madeline Wise and Morgan Green, and <a href=""http://cargocollective.com/egg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EGG</a>, with brother Max Cramer. Milo's plays include <em>William Shakespeare's Mom</em>, <em>I'm Miserable but Change Scares Me</em>, and<em>Mwah</em>, and his work has been seen in New York at Ars Nova, Galapagos Art Space, and The Brick, and outside of New York at Williamstown Theater Festival and on YouTube. Excerpts of Milo's plays have been published in Bard Colllege's <em>Bard Papers</em>, Bennington College's <em>Plain China</em>, and Brooklyn College's<em> </em><em>The Brooklyn Review</em>.</p>
<p>Each individual will bring an exciting and unique perspective to this play and by contributing, you will be enabling us to fully realize all that our imaginations can conjure.</p>
<p>And the spaces, oh the spaces, where we will be creating are both so exciting and perfect for our process. Penasco Theatre is situated in a rural part of northern New Mexico and it is a theatre whose focus is physical theatre, circus arts, and the education of children in these areas. Cloud City is the new venue brought to you by those folks that first brought you Dead Herring. With a history of clown, comedy, variety, and music shows, we are extremely pleased to be joining the ranks of amazing performance art that has gone and will be going through this venue. It is a large, raw space in Williamsburg that we will be transforming into our own little world. Like I said, perfect.</p>
<p><strong>The Nitty Gritty        </strong></p>
<p>After meeting with Claire and the designers, it was determined that we need to raise $5,000</p>
<p>This money will be spent on</p>
<ul>
<li>Reimbursing the company for plane tickets to New Mexico and other transportation needs once we arrive</li>
<li>The barebones design elements that we will construct in New Mexico</li>
<li>Rehearsal space once we arrive back in Brooklyn</li>
<li>Scenic/prop elements and necessary tools</li>
<li>Lighting equipment</li>
<li>Costumes and make up</li>
<li>Equipment for sound</li>
<li>Advertisement</li>
</ul><p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will first reimburse plane tickets and then we will reexamine our design elements in order to compensate. BUT! We are so confident that we will be able to reach our goal because of the support from folks just like you.</p>
<p>And to thank you for your generosity, we have created some very enticing benefits for different levels of donation! These include quality time with the collaborative team, personally composed songs, baked goods, poems, and more!</p>
<p><strong>So what’s the big deal about On Fonts?</strong></p>
<p>On Fonts is the first production of Portal Sans Serif, a new production company I am launching. So far, I have produced/created children’s music events, cabaret and variety shows, small plays, literary theatre events, and folk music, all with the same goal but now under the same name. The mission statement for the Portal is simple: Opening doors and bravely crossing through thresholds with the content placed on stage, we aim to provide a clear and precise perspective while creating an earnest and unique experience for both performers and audience members alike.</p>
<p>Theatre and performance should be mutually beneficial to the people on stage and the people watching. It is an experience, an event, to be shared and considered. By fully fleshing out this production, we will have the opportunity to do our best to provide something worth spending time seeing. It will be worth that subway ride to Brooklyn and worth the money you spent on a ticket and a beer, and totally worth the time you spend with us at a bar afterward and, I am confident enough to say, that it will be worth that subway ride all the way back home.</p>
<p><strong>What else is there to give?</strong></p>
<p>If you find yourself asking this question, that is great! There are plenty of other ways to get involved that are not giving to this campaign. Maybe you have a car and you want to help us pick up rented lighting equipment. Maybe you have a really nice aunt in New Mexico that wants to make dinner for a group of vagabond theatre folk. Maybe you have a loud voice and want to help us get the word out about the show. Any help you can offer will be appreciated beyond belief.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, I will think to myself and, most likely, say on all sorts of social media, “We couldn’t have done it without you.” And that is and will be completely the case. We will build this show based on the generosity of the humans around us. So thank you. Thank you for your time and your support. </p>

Milo's plays include William Shakespeare's Mom, I'm Miserable but Change Scares Me, andMwah, and his work has been seen in New York at Ars Nova, Galapagos Art Space, and The Brick, and outside of New York at Williamstown Theater Festival and on YouTube. Excerpts of Milo's plays have been published in Bard Colllege's Bard Papers, Bennington College's Plain China, and Brooklyn College's The Brooklyn Review.
Each individual will bring an exciting and unique perspective to this play and by contributing, you will be enabling us to fully realize all that our imaginations can conjure.
And the spaces, oh the spaces, where we will be creating are both so exciting and perfect for our process. Penasco Theatre is situated in a rural part of northern New Mexico and it is a theatre whose focus is physical theatre, circus arts, and the education of children in these areas. Cloud City is the new venue brought to you by those folks that first brought you Dead Herring. With a history of clown, comedy, variety, and music shows, we are extremely pleased to be joining the ranks of amazing performance art that has gone and will be going through this venue. It is a large, raw space in Williamsburg that we will be transforming into our own little world. Like I said, perfect.
The Nitty Gritty        
After meeting with Claire and the designers, it was determined that we need to raise $5,000
This money will be spent on

Reimbursing the company for plane tickets to New Mexico and other transportation needs once we arrive
The barebones design elements that we will construct in New Mexico
Rehearsal space once we arrive back in Brooklyn
Scenic/prop elements and necessary tools
Lighting equipment
Costumes and make up
Equipment for sound
Advertisement
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will first reimburse plane tickets and then we will reexamine our design elements in order to compensate. BUT! We are so confident that we will be able to reach our goal because of the support from folks just like you.
And to thank you for your generosity, we have created some very enticing benefits for different levels of donation! These include quality time with the collaborative team, personally composed songs, baked goods, poems, and more!
So what’s the big deal about On Fonts?
On Fonts is the first production of Portal Sans Serif, a new production company I am launching. So far, I have produced/created children’s music events, cabaret and variety shows, small plays, literary theatre events, and folk music, all with the same goal but now under the same name. The mission statement for the Portal is simple: Opening doors and bravely crossing through thresholds with the content placed on stage, we aim to provide a clear and precise perspective while creating an earnest and unique experience for both performers and audience members alike.
Theatre and performance should be mutually beneficial to the people on stage and the people watching. It is an experience, an event, to be shared and considered. By fully fleshing out this production, we will have the opportunity to do our best to provide something worth spending time seeing. It will be worth that subway ride to Brooklyn and worth the money you spent on a ticket and a beer, and totally worth the time you spend with us at a bar afterward and, I am confident enough to say, that it will be worth that subway ride all the way back home.
What else is there to give?
If you find yourself asking this question, that is great! There are plenty of other ways to get involved that are not giving to this campaign. Maybe you have a car and you want to help us pick up rented lighting equipment. Maybe you have a really nice aunt in New Mexico that wants to make dinner for a group of vagabond theatre folk. Maybe you have a loud voice and want to help us get the word out about the show. Any help you can offer will be appreciated beyond belief.
When all is said and done, I will think to myself and, most likely, say on all sorts of social media, “We couldn’t have done it without you.” And that is and will be completely the case. We will build this show based on the generosity of the humans around us. So thank you. Thank you for your time and your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Last fall, with support from La Jolla Playhouse, we created an acclaimed, site-specific staging of <i>Our Town</i> for the inaugural Without Walls Festival. Then, forging a partnership with San Diego's NTC Foundation, we created two more site-specific works in a refurbished Navy barracks. We are excited that <i>Orpheus &amp; Eurydice</i> will again push us into new territory, thanks to its interdisciplinary structure. The online parts of the project require that we enhance our internet capabilities. Also, without giving too much away, the live performance in San Diego will include an extended video sequence of several minutes. We will hire a cinematographer and editor, and secure the equipment that is necessary to create this sequence in a professional, beautiful way. Finally, we remain committed to building a consistent ensemble; gathering our artistic family in San Diego creates additional cost, but we believe the benefits to the work more than justify that cost. Once again, this TRIP production will prominently feature alumni of UCSD's Department of Theatre &amp; Dance.</p><p>We wish we didn't have to come asking for your support, but we do.

<h3>FROM THE PLAYWRIGHT</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>This play has been MANY years in the making.</b></p>
<p><b>I started writing this play</b> <b>when I was pregnant with my
now-seven-year-old.</b>  But the story started long before that.</p>
<p><b>This play was born in 2002 when I said I would marry my
husband.</b>  <span><br/></span>I had nightmares.  Bad ones. 
He died in lots of them.  Suddenly
I had something to lose.  And from that
moment I understood the delicate relationship between love and death.  They are tethered together, each giving
forcing meaning on the other.  </p>
<p><b>This play was born in 1964 when my grandmother suddenly died
<span><br/></span></b>at the age of 54, leaving my grandfather alone to wander the world, writing
haiku.  He wrote about how much he missed
her.  And about regret.  About things he should have said to her when
she was alive.  And worse, things he
shouldn’t have said and could now never take back.  My grandfather’s haiku wove themselves
into this play because it is also about time and inheritance.  About appreciating a moment and repeating our
mistakes—and perhaps those that have come before us.</p>
<p><b>This play was born in 1959 when my parents were
married.</b>  <span><br/></span>On their fiftieth wedding
anniversary, I interviewed them.  How do
you make a marriage last?, I asked.  My father, the mathematician,
said: time and space.  Perhaps that’s why
I wrote the fourth dimension into the play? 
Because when we speak of love, concrete meaning eludes us.  Yet e<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">very time I write, I write about love.  I write about fear.  And I write about our messy attempts to find
a home. As Ellie says in the play:</span></p>
<p><i>I refuse to let time
mend my wounds<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I refuse to move on<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Don’t they
understand?<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Love is an emotion<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It’s a place<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You are my home<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And I’m not leaving</span></i></p>
<p>Please help us turn these words
into an experience.  <span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Into something that sparks a discussion:<span><br/></span></span><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is love?  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> <span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And how do you
make it last?</span></b></p>

a wacky love storynot the Hallmark varietythe messy, screwing up, begging for mercy kind


May 8 – June 7, 2015@ The Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena



UNTETHERED is a project of the Pasadena Arts Council’s EMERGE Program. Donations to UNTETHERED  are tax deductible under Federal ID 95-2540759. The Pasadena Arts Council is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.



WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT THIS PLAY?
Have you ever been
in love?  Have you ever had a fight?  Have you ever thought: I’m done with
this?  Or: I don’t know how we can get through
this?  Committing to someone is the easy
part.  It’s the “til death” part that gets
messy.  Untethered sparks a vital
discussion about everyone’s issue—how
do we make love last?  

WHY AM I ASKING YOU FOR MONEY?
We are reaching
out to family and friends to raise money to support:
·  live
site-specific theatre in interesting off-beat
venues·  dedicated
professional actors who love working
on the stage even though they make peanuts doing it·  and relevant new plays by women playwrights.  Did you
know that on average fewer than 20% of
professionally produced plays are by women?

WHAT WILL WE DO WITH YOUR MONEY?
Julia Edwards' last playFamily Planning that was performed in residential homes around Los Angeles went on to win the LA Ovation Award for Best Production in a small theatre.  She's back for another site-specific experience.  The answer to ""what will we do with your money?"" is simple:
We will mount the world-premiere of UNTETHEREDin a stunning and unusual venue—the mausoleum at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, CA. 

THIS PLAY NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT!
Now for some...theatre mathematics.  
The production budget is $25,000. 
Miniscule compared to a film.  But
we’d need 500 friends giving $50 to get there. 
Uh.  That’s…a lot of friends.  Or 250 friends giving $100 would work.  Or 100 friends giving $250.  A couple of $500 and $1000 friends sure would
help.  You get the picture.

FROM THE PLAYWRIGHT


This play has been MANY years in the making.
I started writing this play when I was pregnant with my
now-seven-year-old.  But the story started long before that.
This play was born in 2002 when I said I would marry my
husband.  I had nightmares.  Bad ones. 
He died in lots of them.  Suddenly
I had something to lose.  And from that
moment I understood the delicate relationship between love and death.  They are tethered together, each giving
forcing meaning on the other.  
This play was born in 1964 when my grandmother suddenly died
at the age of 54, leaving my grandfather alone to wander the world, writing
haiku.  He wrote about how much he missed
her.  And about regret.  About things he should have said to her when
she was alive.  And worse, things he
shouldn’t have said and could now never take back.  My grandfather’s haiku wove themselves
into this play because it is also about time and inheritance.  About appreciating a moment and repeating our
mistakes—and perhaps those that have come before us.
This play was born in 1959 when my parents were
married.  On their fiftieth wedding
anniversary, I interviewed them.  How do
you make a marriage last?, I asked.  My father, the mathematician,
said: time and space.  Perhaps that’s why
I wrote the fourth dimension into the play? 
Because when we speak of love, concrete meaning eludes us.  Yet every time I write, I write about love.  I write about fear.  And I write about our messy attempts to find
a home. As Ellie says in the play:
I refuse to let time
mend my woundsI refuse to move onDon’t they
understand?Love is an emotionIt’s a placeYou are my homeAnd I’m not leaving
Please help us turn these words
into an experience.  Into something that sparks a discussion:What is love?   And how do you
make it last?

love with not only each other but working together as actors while making a
horror-scifi-comedy feature film back in the summer of 2012 (</span><span style=""font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #1A1A1A;""><a href=""http://www.return2nukeemhigh.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style='font-family: ""Heiti SC Medium""; color: #003DC9;'>""Return to Nuke 'em High</span><span style=""color: #003DC9;""> </span><span style='font-family: ""Heiti SC Medium""; color: #003DC9;'>Vol.1 &amp; 2""</span></a></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: ""Heiti SC Medium""; color: #1A1A1A;'>). Since
then, we have steadily built a network of filmmaking friends in the horror and
independent film community, and on the strength of our work, we have been
offered a variety of projects which either fell apart or we simply turned down
due to creative differences/time constraints. Though we have been fortunate
enough to work on a variety of projects including short films, web series, and
pre-produciton on upcoming features, something is missing. Over time, both of
us began to feel an overwhelming need to go back to our roots in acting. After
much soul searching and some hard living, we came to the realization that in
order to be offered more compelling work, we needed a showcase of sorts for the
people who could help bring our career to the next level (agents, fellow
actors, and filmmakers).</span><span style=""font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: ArialMT; color: #1A1A1A;""> </span><br/></p>

because we, as two fiercely independent New Yorkers who once thought we were
alone, somehow found in each other a soulmate. In the emotionally raw scenario
cultivated by Shanley, this is also the story of Danny &amp; Roberta.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

life. We will do this as a means of catharsis for us as a couple, as an
exercise to re-engage our acting muscles, and as a platform to showcase our
talent. Our hope is to signify to the artistic community of New York that we
seek - and are capable of - the most challenging, provocative work out there.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

father's work she was also raised in Holland and Spain before settling back in
Texas; the frequently-displaced Paredes had to learn early on how to adapt
quickly. Toughened by the Southwest and cultured by Europe, she channeled her
aggression into the theatre and found grace through ballet, piano &amp; even
some martial arts-- ultimately she landed a scholarship at the University of
Minnesota's prestigious BFA Actor Training Program at the Guthrie Theater. Four
years later she was doing plays in New York City, but after some study with
improv comedy at UCB, she found herself starring in the fun Funny or Die video,
'Battleship Pitch Meeting' made by her friend, Dave Herman. Emboldened by the
positive reception to her on-camera presence and skills as a comedic actress,
the ever-impulsive Paredes auditioned for Troma's subversive
scifi-horror-comedy event film 'Return to Nuke 'Em High: Volume 1 &amp; 2.'
After a month-long call back process, the tough-as-nails actress won the lead
role of Chrissy. Universally acclaimed for her performance as the disenchanted,
sexually-confused high school senior, Paredes has become a cult icon overnight.
Already attached to several independent feature films, Asta Paredes continues to
carve a path through the industry and is excited to be going back to her roots
in theatre with this show. (Coincidentally ""Danny &amp; the Deep Blue
Sea"" was her first scene study in college so it has a sentimental meaning
to her to go back.)</span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#333333"" size=""2""><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: ""Heiti SC Medium""; color: #262626;'><br/></span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">

parents who knew next to nothing about theatre, yet found herself drawn to the
arts anyway. By seven years old, she was convinced she would become a pop singer
after singing “My Heart Will Go On” at her third grade talent show and spent
the next ten years studying with several voice teachers who introduced her to
musical theatre. Finding that her love for performing came from storytelling,
she would pursue a (slightly) more realistic career as an actor and obtain her
B.A. in Theatre Performance at Marymount Manhattan College. It was in college
she found an additional love for directing, and has continued to direct in the
city since graduating in May 2012. After working on several one-act plays, she
directed her first full-length play, FIVE WOMEN WEARING THE SAME DRESS with TRG
Productions last Spring. In pursuit of finding an artistic home to further
develop her craft in acting and directing, she joined the Seeing Place Theater
company in the Fall and assistant-directed their last production of TWO ROOMS
by Lee Blessing which opened in March with excellent reviews. She will be
working as a dramaturg on their next show, THE LARAMIE PROJECT, opening this
June. Later in the summer, she will be directing a new post-apocalyptic zombie
play titled RAISE ME UP written by Charlie Biscotto for a three-week run in
September. She is so thrilled to be involved in this production of DANNY AND
THE DEEP BLUE SEA and to be working with such dedicated and passionate actors.</span></font></p><p></p><p></p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#23282e""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 21px;"">

setting is a rundown bar in the Bronx, where two of society's rejects, Danny
and Roberta, strike up a halting conversation over their beer. He is a
brooding, self-loathing young man who resorts more to violence than reason; she
is a divorced, guilt-ridden young woman whose troubled teenage son is now being
cared for by her parents. Danny, whose fellow truck drivers call him ""the
animal,"" seems incapable of tender emotion, while Roberta, who is still
haunted by the memory of an ugly sexual incident involving her father, is
distrustful of men in general. And yet, as their initial reserve begins to
melt, and they decide to spend the night together, the possibility of a genuine
and meaningful relationship begins to emerge—the first for both of them. In the
end there are no facile, easy answers, but thanks to the playwright's skill and
compassion, both characters are able to probe within themselves to find an
exorcism and forgiveness that, while painfully achieved, offers the hope of a
future touched, at last, with more than the bitterness and loneliness that had
been their lot before their fateful meeting""<span style=""color: #1A1A1A;""></span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

His mother was a telephone operator and his father was a meat-packer. Growing up in what was considered a ""rough neighborhood,"" Shanley had trouble adhering to the restrictions of Catholic curriculum, and was kicked out of both kindergarten and high school. After an unsuccessful freshman year at NYU, he was placed on academic probation and subsequently enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, serving a stateside post during the Vietnam War. Upon completion of military service, the newly-disciplined, somewhat self-destructive Shanley channeled his ideas into a novel and burned it before returning to NYU.

Though critical and commercial success of the similarly-themed 'Moonstruck' led to a more lucrative career as a screenwriter, Shanley continued penning plays, winning the Pulitzer Prize (among many other accolades) for 'Doubt' in 2005, and much more acclaim and notoriety from his 2008 film adaptation with Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. </span><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#262626""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 17px;"">Known as the 'Bard of the Bronx,' </span></font><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(38, 38, 38); font-family: 'Heiti SC Medium'; font-size: 17px;"">Shanley resides in New York City and continues to write for film and theatre.</span></p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#262626"">

</span></font></p></div>","So here's the deal...Clay von Carlowitz and I (Asta Paredes) are two classically trained NYC based actors who met and fell in
love with not only each other but working together as actors while making a
horror-scifi-comedy feature film back in the summer of 2012 (""Return to Nuke 'em High Vol.1 & 2""). Since
then, we have steadily built a network of filmmaking friends in the horror and
independent film community, and on the strength of our work, we have been
offered a variety of projects which either fell apart or we simply turned down
due to creative differences/time constraints. Though we have been fortunate
enough to work on a variety of projects including short films, web series, and
pre-produciton on upcoming features, something is missing. Over time, both of
us began to feel an overwhelming need to go back to our roots in acting. After
much soul searching and some hard living, we came to the realization that in
order to be offered more compelling work, we needed a showcase of sorts for the
people who could help bring our career to the next level (agents, fellow
actors, and filmmakers). 
We decided that showcase would be ""Danny & the Deep
Blue Sea"" by John Patrick Shanley. We chose this story in particular
because we, as two fiercely independent New Yorkers who once thought we were
alone, somehow found in each other a soulmate. In the emotionally raw scenario
cultivated by Shanley, this is also the story of Danny & Roberta.
For two nights this summer, we would like to bring this story to
life. We will do this as a means of catharsis for us as a couple, as an
exercise to re-engage our acting muscles, and as a platform to showcase our
talent. Our hope is to signify to the artistic community of New York that we
seek - and are capable of - the most challenging, provocative work out there.
Having attained permission from the playwright, we are currently
hard at work on rehearsals and we are shopping for theater spaces. With your
help, we can make this show happen and take the next big step in our lives and
our career! 
 
THE SHOW...
(logo design by Lauren Hom)The Cast
Clay von Carlowitz as DANNY










The second oldest of nine children, Clay von Carlowitz was born
in Euclid, OH, on January 4th, 1987. Raised in a conservative Midwestern
environment east of Cleveland, the daydreaming von Carlowitz decided early on
to trade conformity for mimicry, the consequence of which was the development
of his skills as an actor, writer and director. Following his studies at
Kenyon College and the University of Exeter, the classically-trained actor wrote,
directed and starred in his first feature film, supernatural thriller ""The
House in the Woods."" He then spent a year doing odd jobs, background work
and acting classes in
LA before ultimately settling in New York City, where he initially pursued
theatre. After a series of false starts, von Carlowitz eventually
fell in with the indie film scene through his acclaimed comedic performance as
the sexually-frustrated social outcast Eugene in Troma Entertainment's
subversive scifi-comedy ""Return to Nuke 'Em High Vol. 1 & 2."" He
is ecstatic to be returning to the stage in what will be his first dramatic
leading role since starring in David Mamet's ""Oleanna"" his senior
year at Kenyon.
Asta Paredes as ROBERTA
Asta Paredes was born in Beaumont, Texas.  Due to her
father's work she was also raised in Holland and Spain before settling back in
Texas; the frequently-displaced Paredes had to learn early on how to adapt
quickly. Toughened by the Southwest and cultured by Europe, she channeled her
aggression into the theatre and found grace through ballet, piano & even
some martial arts-- ultimately she landed a scholarship at the University of
Minnesota's prestigious BFA Actor Training Program at the Guthrie Theater. Four
years later she was doing plays in New York City, but after some study with
improv comedy at UCB, she found herself starring in the fun Funny or Die video,
'Battleship Pitch Meeting' made by her friend, Dave Herman. Emboldened by the
positive reception to her on-camera presence and skills as a comedic actress,
the ever-impulsive Paredes auditioned for Troma's subversive
scifi-horror-comedy event film 'Return to Nuke 'Em High: Volume 1 & 2.'
After a month-long call back process, the tough-as-nails actress won the lead
role of Chrissy. Universally acclaimed for her performance as the disenchanted,
sexually-confused high school senior, Paredes has become a cult icon overnight.
Already attached to several independent feature films, Asta Paredes continues to
carve a path through the industry and is excited to be going back to her roots
in theatre with this show. (Coincidentally ""Danny & the Deep Blue
Sea"" was her first scene study in college so it has a sentimental meaning
to her to go back.)

Our Director:

 Meg Grujon












Meg Grujon was born in Portland, Oregon and raised by two South African
parents who knew next to nothing about theatre, yet found herself drawn to the
arts anyway. By seven years old, she was convinced she would become a pop singer
after singing “My Heart Will Go On” at her third grade talent show and spent
the next ten years studying with several voice teachers who introduced her to
musical theatre. Finding that her love for performing came from storytelling,
she would pursue a (slightly) more realistic career as an actor and obtain her
B.A. in Theatre Performance at Marymount Manhattan College. It was in college
she found an additional love for directing, and has continued to direct in the
city since graduating in May 2012. After working on several one-act plays, she
directed her first full-length play, FIVE WOMEN WEARING THE SAME DRESS with TRG
Productions last Spring. In pursuit of finding an artistic home to further
develop her craft in acting and directing, she joined the Seeing Place Theater
company in the Fall and assistant-directed their last production of TWO ROOMS
by Lee Blessing which opened in March with excellent reviews. She will be
working as a dramaturg on their next show, THE LARAMIE PROJECT, opening this
June. Later in the summer, she will be directing a new post-apocalyptic zombie
play titled RAISE ME UP written by Charlie Biscotto for a three-week run in
September. She is so thrilled to be involved in this production of DANNY AND
THE DEEP BLUE SEA and to be working with such dedicated and passionate actors.


 The Story
""The
setting is a rundown bar in the Bronx, where two of society's rejects, Danny
and Roberta, strike up a halting conversation over their beer. He is a
brooding, self-loathing young man who resorts more to violence than reason; she
is a divorced, guilt-ridden young woman whose troubled teenage son is now being
cared for by her parents. Danny, whose fellow truck drivers call him ""the
animal,"" seems incapable of tender emotion, while Roberta, who is still
haunted by the memory of an ugly sexual incident involving her father, is
distrustful of men in general. And yet, as their initial reserve begins to
melt, and they decide to spend the night together, the possibility of a genuine
and meaningful relationship begins to emerge—the first for both of them. In the
end there are no facile, easy answers, but thanks to the playwright's skill and
compassion, both characters are able to probe within themselves to find an
exorcism and forgiveness that, while painfully achieved, offers the hope of a
future touched, at last, with more than the bitterness and loneliness that had
been their lot before their fateful meeting""

The Playwright


JOHN PATRICK SHANLEYJohn Patrick Shanley was born on October 3rd, 1950, in the Bronx, New York City. His mother was a telephone operator and his father was a meat-packer. Growing up in what was considered a ""rough neighborhood,"" Shanley had trouble adhering to the restrictions of Catholic curriculum, and was kicked out of both kindergarten and high school. After an unsuccessful freshman year at NYU, he was placed on academic probation and subsequently enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, serving a stateside post during the Vietnam War. Upon completion of military service, the newly-disciplined, somewhat self-destructive Shanley channeled his ideas into a novel and burned it before returning to NYU. A few years later, he was valedictorian. Shanley went on to become a playwright, gaining major notice from the 1984 Off-Broadway production of 'Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,' which starred a young John Turturro as Danny. Though critical and commercial success of the similarly-themed 'Moonstruck' led to a more lucrative career as a screenwriter, Shanley continued penning plays, winning the Pulitzer Prize (among many other accolades) for 'Doubt' in 2005, and much more acclaim and notoriety from his 2008 film adaptation with Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Known as the 'Bard of the Bronx,' Shanley resides in New York City and continues to write for film and theatre.
'Danny & the Deep Blue Sea' dedication:""This play is dedicated to everyone in the Bronx who punched me or kissed me, and to everyone whom I punched or kissed.""
What's different in THIS production?
The APACHE DANCE!
(Photo by Brooke DiDonato Photography)












John Patrick Shanley defines an ‘Apache Dance’ as:
A violent dance for two people, originated by the Parisian
Apaches. Parisian Apaches are gangsters or ruffians.
For THIS production, because of trust and insanity, we are
going to use this dance style as a prologue and a means of transition for Danny
& Roberta.

<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p><b style=""font-style: italic;"">Hold Me Tight </b>is inspired by the true-crime story <b>Christine and Lea Papin</b>, sisters, maids and supposedly lovers.  On the evening of February 2nd, 1933, the two massacred their employer, Madame Lancelin, and her daughter, Genevieve, gouging out their eyes, smashing their skulls, and beating the two women to an unrecognizable pulp.</p>
<p><b><i>Hold Me Tight</i></b> focuses on the intense intimacy between the sisters, and how that intimacy led to such extreme violence. </p>
<p>This original devised theatre-dance production is the thesis project of Naomi Bennett, MFA candidate in Television, Film and Theatre at California State University, Los Angeles. </p>
<p>As an ensemble, we have worked for the past nine months using dance, spoken word, soundscaping, and integrated media to explore the supposed incestuous relationship of the sisters, their ostracization, isolation, and how we as performers can relate to their Delire a Deux.  Our explorations have unearthed issues of class, gender, sexuality, and the basic human need for physical touch.</p>

</h3>
<p>I've been involved in theater since the ripe age of 10, and if I'm completely honest with you, it's all I ever wanted to do. I was a shy kid (those in my family might laugh at this, but it's true) and acting has always been a way for me to express myself. As I've grown up my passion has only grown. My need to entertain, to share a story, to give back to the world that's given me so much. <br/></p>
<p>After graduating from the University of Oregon in 2012 I moved to the Bay Area. Some of you may have seen me in readings at the famed Exit Theatre  in San Francisco, at the Actor's Ensemble of Berkeley, or in my recent 3-woman performance of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) at the Contra Costa Civic Theatre. </p>
<p>My time here has been amazing, but it's become clear to me that I still have a lot to learn in order to reach my full potential. In May I was blessed to be accepted to the Portland Actors Conservatory as a member of their professional actor training program.</p>
<p>As a student at PAC I will learn from some of the best in the northwest, expand my collaborative skills, and learn new practices and techniques, as well as honing my current skill set. I'll be able to work with local professionals as well as my peers in my journey to become a more well rounded and experienced actor - and person.</p>
<p>Attending PAC is going to be the opportunity of a lifetime, and I would love for you to be part of that.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Now for the hard part</h3>
<p>FAFSA will only cover part of my tuition. Additionally, the program is 9-5 Monday-Friday,  September - May, so it's unlikely I'll be able to work during my time at school. My goal is to raise enough funds to cover the rest of my tuition and help with housing costs (so I don't have to live in the theater basement like the Phantom of the Opera), plus cover the fees from indiegogo. Every dollar helps!<br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
</div> <div> <h3>But how can I ever repay you?</h3>I know times are hard. We all have a million causes we'd love to support and help out. Please know your support means so much to me. The encouragement I have received over the past years from friends, family, coworkers (heck, even customers at work!) has meant the world to me. If you are somehow able to contribute in any way, I will be eternally grateful! Any donation will receive a personalized thank you, and any other goodies I can send your way.<br/><br/><br/>

</h3><h3>THE MAN BURNS is a mystical, joyous theatrical observation on Burning Man and a glimpse into the lives of people who make this epic trek once a year. This interactive play breaks down the walls and gives you a night at Burning Man</h3><div>
<h1>********************************</h1>
<h2>LISTEN TO SCENES FROM THE PLAY</h2>

<h1>*******************************</h1>
</div>
<div>
<h2>MY VISION</h2>
<p>This is not a play that will be performed at Burning Man-this will be performed off-playa, in your city, in a theater.</p>
<p>You walk up to the theater to see a performance of a new play, ""The Man Burns.""  Out front is an art car playing music and getting the evening going. When you enter the theater the first thing you notice is a group of people gathered around a costume exchange picking out free colorful clothing accessories like a faux fur mantle or a set of glowing devil horns to wear inside the theater. If you brought an extra costume piece you can leave it behind for someone else.</p>
<br/>

<p>Next, you'll come across an old tiki bar called MAKIMAKI, the kind of bar you might accidentally happen on the esplanade at Burning Man. MAKIMAKI is decorated with well-traveled thrift shop tiki items. The house cocktail is of course, the MAKIMAKI, but there are other playa-themed cocktails as well. And a jar of pickled eggs on the counter. </p>
<p> When you go inside you'll notice that the theater is decorated like the inside of a Mongolian yurt with beautiful tapestries lining the walls. The play begins. If you've never been to Burning Man you will be transported to this far-off, mysterious place. If you've been to the playa before you will find yourself back home, in the middle of a conversation about connectivity, overwhelming art, accidental sharts, (or accidental art and overwhelming sharts),  late night poutine and Burning Man urban myths. </p>
<p>During intermission and after the play there might be a marching band or or someone playing jazz songs on their ukelele or grilled cheese sandwiches being handed out. The party will change from city to city because YOU  are the party. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>WHY WON'T MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY COME TO BURNING MAN?</h2>
<p>It's too hot. It's overrun by naked hippies. It's too far away. There are no real showers. It used to be better ten years ago. </p>
<p>Those are some of the reasons I've heard from friends and relatives about why they'll never come to Burning Man. But they love hearing stories about the playa and seeing at all the photographs.  By making ""THE MAN BURNS"" an interactive night with elements of Burning Man, I could give all of my friends a Burning Man night. And you can too. Everyone has <i>at least</i> 5 friends or relatives who say they'll never go. Bring them to see ""THE MAN BURNS"" and share the experience with them. </p>

<h2>
<b>WHO I AM</b> </h2>
<p>My name is David Vernon and I grew up in a show biz family. My dad was a comedian and the voice of Frosty the Snowman. I spent my childhood backstage at The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show and wondering why my father was never the ""Secret Square"" on The Hollywood Squares. I also grew up with a love of story. Eventually, I took my love of story to the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU where I studied Film and TV. </p>
<p> I have been a professional writer for the past twenty years.  I've written short fiction (which has been widely anthologized), screenplays (a film I wrote, ""The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green"" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and  was released by Regent films.)  I was recently commissioned to write three short scripts for an upcoming feature film anthology about the city of Berlin by the producers of ""New York, I Love You.""  I've written essays on Salon (<a href=""http://www.salon.com/2000/12/20/frosty/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2000/12/20/frosty/</a>  I was chosen to participate in the IFP Screenwriter's Lab. I also sold a TV sitcom pilot to the Fox Network called ""American Has-Beens."" </p>
<p>Before dedicating myself full time to writing, I worked as Head of Development for a film and TV producer at Warner Brothers. At another point I worked for a theater producer and was in charge of attending theater festivals, such as the incredible Humana Festival in Louisville, KY, to find plays that might work for Broadway and off-Broadway. </p>
<p>I didn't know it at the time but all of these projects and jobs were training grounds for my most challenging and exciting project to date.</p>

<p>A whiteout is announced at Burning Man over the radio.  People are warned to take shelter. Within moments several strangers run into a Mongolian yurt to get away from the wind storm. <img alt=""photo by Ian Norman"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/290/688/161ea2c79a3f82a307cb57d863853d1f_large.jpg?1405531940"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/></p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><p>(photo by Ian Norman)</p>
<p>The strangers include: ANDY and BUNNY EARS, a gay couple that own the Mongolian Yurt and were preparing for a hot sexual encounter with someone they met on the playa. FIREFLY, a virgin burner who just dropped her first ever hit of MDMA and was on her way to a dance club, PERSEPHONE, an Australian sci-fi actress looking for a ride share to Venice Beach after having another disappointing day on the playa, MOWGLI, a bouncy, energetic young guy dressed entirely in blinky lights who communicates only through motion, MARY ANIMALS, a 60 year old woman who comes to Burning Man on her own and sets up a coffee stand (with the worst coffee on the playa), that is destroyed in the white out, and an ex-marine with an unfortunate sense of direction, known as McRIB, who is dressed in a sketchy Ronald McDonald outfit who was on his way to fight at Thunderdome but got lost. <br/></p>
<p>The result is playa chaos as these characters, and a few others, spend the evening connecting, disconnecting, dancing to some great music on the Burning Man radio, arguing, and telling their Burning Man stories; some heartbreaking, some extraordinary.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
<p>I've been going to Burning Man for the past eleven years and have also been active in the Burner community. During that time I've witnessed   many fascinating Burning Man stories unfold in front of me. I've also met  so many fascinating and unique individuals. Their stories inspired me to write ""THE MAN BURNS."" </p>
<p>The people who go to Burning Man travel a great distance and experience great joy, and sometimes hardship in search of....what exactly? A unique vacation? An opportunity to meet like-minded people? A chance to become part of something bigger than ourselves...part of an artistic experiment? After years of taking notes,  I became passionate about writing a play that explored these questions. </p>
<p>For many people, ""THE MAN BURNS"" might be the closest they come to attending Burning Man. For others it might be their first introduction to this amazing place. For Burners, I hope the play might be a catalyst for them to further discuss their own experiences and stories. </p>

<p>I have been developing the story and working on ""THE MAN BURNS"" for the past three years.There is still more work to be done to get the play up and running. </p>
<p><b>PHASE 1</b>: Additional creatives will be brought in, a director will be hired, an art director and a costume designer. The casting process will begin. </p>
<p><b>PHASE 2</b>: The play will receive its world premiere performances in San Francisco and Los Angeles. </p>
<p><b>PHASE 3</b>: After taking into account what I've learned from the initial performances I will make further adjustments to the play. Then, the hope is to bring ""THE MAN BURNS"" to other cities in the U.S. and ultimately off-Broadway---and perhaps even to other countries. </p>

<h2>WHY CROWD FUNDING?</h2>
<p>When I worked as a scout in the theater world I was amazed at how difficult it was for a playright to get even the smallest production of their play mounted. It usually involves sending your play to many different producers and waiting months for them to even take a look at it, if they ever do. The process can take years and I don't like to sit around waiting for someone else make my dreams happen. Instead of having my play sit on the bottom of a stack of plays on a producer's desk, why not turn to the community of burners and fans of innovative theater to help me bring this project into existence? We have the power to make this happen.</p>
<h2>HOW WILL WE USE YOUR PLEDGES TO MAKE THIS A GREAT THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE?</h2>
<p>I am working on a very tight budget for THE MAN BURNS. $15,000 is not much to mount a production of a new play in two cities. I have already invested much of my own money to the development of this play. Your generous donations will help with the cost of renting a theater in Los Angeles and in San Francisco, casting, rehearsals, and setting up the after party events. </p>
<p>I will be counting on the passion of tight knit community of artists to help bring this dream alive on a limited budget. </p>

LISTEN TO SCENES FROM THE PLAY

*******************************


MY VISION
This is not a play that will be performed at Burning Man-this will be performed off-playa, in your city, in a theater.
You walk up to the theater to see a performance of a new play, ""The Man Burns.""  Out front is an art car playing music and getting the evening going. When you enter the theater the first thing you notice is a group of people gathered around a costume exchange picking out free colorful clothing accessories like a faux fur mantle or a set of glowing devil horns to wear inside the theater. If you brought an extra costume piece you can leave it behind for someone else.

Next, you'll come across an old tiki bar called MAKIMAKI, the kind of bar you might accidentally happen on the esplanade at Burning Man. MAKIMAKI is decorated with well-traveled thrift shop tiki items. The house cocktail is of course, the MAKIMAKI, but there are other playa-themed cocktails as well. And a jar of pickled eggs on the counter. 
 When you go inside you'll notice that the theater is decorated like the inside of a Mongolian yurt with beautiful tapestries lining the walls. The play begins. If you've never been to Burning Man you will be transported to this far-off, mysterious place. If you've been to the playa before you will find yourself back home, in the middle of a conversation about connectivity, overwhelming art, accidental sharts, (or accidental art and overwhelming sharts),  late night poutine and Burning Man urban myths. 
During intermission and after the play there might be a marching band or or someone playing jazz songs on their ukelele or grilled cheese sandwiches being handed out. The party will change from city to city because YOU  are the party. 

WHY WON'T MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY COME TO BURNING MAN?
It's too hot. It's overrun by naked hippies. It's too far away. There are no real showers. It used to be better ten years ago. 
Those are some of the reasons I've heard from friends and relatives about why they'll never come to Burning Man. But they love hearing stories about the playa and seeing at all the photographs.  By making ""THE MAN BURNS"" an interactive night with elements of Burning Man, I could give all of my friends a Burning Man night. And you can too. Everyone has at least 5 friends or relatives who say they'll never go. Bring them to see ""THE MAN BURNS"" and share the experience with them. 
(author of ""The Man Burns"", David Vernon)

WHO I AM 
My name is David Vernon and I grew up in a show biz family. My dad was a comedian and the voice of Frosty the Snowman. I spent my childhood backstage at The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show and wondering why my father was never the ""Secret Square"" on The Hollywood Squares. I also grew up with a love of story. Eventually, I took my love of story to the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU where I studied Film and TV. 
 I have been a professional writer for the past twenty years.  I've written short fiction (which has been widely anthologized), screenplays (a film I wrote, ""The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green"" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and  was released by Regent films.)  I was recently commissioned to write three short scripts for an upcoming feature film anthology about the city of Berlin by the producers of ""New York, I Love You.""  I've written essays on Salon (http://www.salon.com/2000/12/20/frosty/  I was chosen to participate in the IFP Screenwriter's Lab. I also sold a TV sitcom pilot to the Fox Network called ""American Has-Beens."" 
Before dedicating myself full time to writing, I worked as Head of Development for a film and TV producer at Warner Brothers. At another point I worked for a theater producer and was in charge of attending theater festivals, such as the incredible Humana Festival in Louisville, KY, to find plays that might work for Broadway and off-Broadway. 
I didn't know it at the time but all of these projects and jobs were training grounds for my most challenging and exciting project to date.
THE STORY
A whiteout is announced at Burning Man over the radio.  People are warned to take shelter. Within moments several strangers run into a Mongolian yurt to get away from the wind storm. (photo by Ian Norman)
The strangers include: ANDY and BUNNY EARS, a gay couple that own the Mongolian Yurt and were preparing for a hot sexual encounter with someone they met on the playa. FIREFLY, a virgin burner who just dropped her first ever hit of MDMA and was on her way to a dance club, PERSEPHONE, an Australian sci-fi actress looking for a ride share to Venice Beach after having another disappointing day on the playa, MOWGLI, a bouncy, energetic young guy dressed entirely in blinky lights who communicates only through motion, MARY ANIMALS, a 60 year old woman who comes to Burning Man on her own and sets up a coffee stand (with the worst coffee on the playa), that is destroyed in the white out, and an ex-marine with an unfortunate sense of direction, known as McRIB, who is dressed in a sketchy Ronald McDonald outfit who was on his way to fight at Thunderdome but got lost. 
The result is playa chaos as these characters, and a few others, spend the evening connecting, disconnecting, dancing to some great music on the Burning Man radio, arguing, and telling their Burning Man stories; some heartbreaking, some extraordinary.

INSPIRATION
I've been going to Burning Man for the past eleven years and have also been active in the Burner community. During that time I've witnessed   many fascinating Burning Man stories unfold in front of me. I've also met  so many fascinating and unique individuals. Their stories inspired me to write ""THE MAN BURNS."" 
The people who go to Burning Man travel a great distance and experience great joy, and sometimes hardship in search of....what exactly? A unique vacation? An opportunity to meet like-minded people? A chance to become part of something bigger than ourselves...part of an artistic experiment? After years of taking notes,  I became passionate about writing a play that explored these questions. 
For many people, ""THE MAN BURNS"" might be the closest they come to attending Burning Man. For others it might be their first introduction to this amazing place. For Burners, I hope the play might be a catalyst for them to further discuss their own experiences and stories. 
(photo by Lindsey Sterrett) THE PROCESS
I have been developing the story and working on ""THE MAN BURNS"" for the past three years.There is still more work to be done to get the play up and running. 
PHASE 1: Additional creatives will be brought in, a director will be hired, an art director and a costume designer. The casting process will begin. 
PHASE 2: The play will receive its world premiere performances in San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
PHASE 3: After taking into account what I've learned from the initial performances I will make further adjustments to the play. Then, the hope is to bring ""THE MAN BURNS"" to other cities in the U.S. and ultimately off-Broadway---and perhaps even to other countries.

<p>CALLING ALL FANS OF THE X FILES!

Announcing the World Premiere of Close to HOME: A Musical X File-- the first unauthorized X Files Musical!

On the night of October 11th, 1996, an episode of television aired that would revolutionize the face of the modern American TV Drama.  Condemned for its gruesome depictions and themes, Season 4, Episode 2 of the X Files was pulled from the air immediately after premiering, making it the only episode of its kind in the show's nine seasons of syndication.  And to this day, ""Home"" lives on in infamy in the hearts and minds of television audiences everywhere.

NOW coming to Milwaukee, WI on April 23, 24, and 25, 2015:  the musical parody of the very episode that changed television forever!

Featuring a full original score, new script, and an immensely talented cast of musicians and performers, this hilarious and groundbreaking show will be performed at the ComedySportz MKE Garage before a live audience.  

A donation of $20 or more will earn you 1 reserved ticket to the show before general reservations are opened to the public in April.  

This sure-fire hit will sell out quickly, so guarantee your seat now!

</p><p>Help PlayGround Publications publish
this year’s anthology of the season’s best scripts by pre-ordering a copy of <i>The
Best of PlayGround-Los Angeles (2016)</i></p>
<p><b>THE
BACKSTORY</b></p>
<p>Since 1994, the mission of
PlayGround has been to support the development of new voices for the theatre.
For over two decades, PlayGround has been a leading playwright incubator,
providing unique opportunities for the cultivation and development of
early-career local playwrights and partnerships with leading professional
directors, actors, theatres and theatre lovers. In 2012, PlayGround expanded to
Los Angeles with the launch of PlayGround-LA and its inaugural season in
residence at the Zephyr Theatre.</p>
<p>Through the development of original
short (and now full-length) plays, PlayGround-LA creates a microcosm of the
greater theatre scene, supporting emerging playwrights' experimentation and
risk-taking, while helping them hone their style and technique.</p>
<p><b>PUBLISH
OR PERISH</b></p>
<p>For the past fifteen years,
PlayGround Publications has promoted the work of scores of emerging new
playwrights and their short plays through the <i>Best of PlayGround</i> series

performed at this year’s Best of PlayGround Gala new plays showcase (May 9,
2016). These six plays were selected as the best this season from more than 160
submissions and thirty-six works developed through the Monday Night PlayGround
staged reading series.</p>
<p>Each script is printed in its
entirety, creating an historical record of the development of these plays, with
dates of first reading and premiere, original casting information and
playwright biographies.</p>
<p>Proceeds of this funding campaign
will be used exclusively to print and distribute the <i>Best of PlayGround-Los
Angeles</i> anthology.</p>
<p>The <i>Best of PlayGround</i>
anthologies:</p>
<ul>

<li>Provide an economical way to bring high-quality
     audience-tested scripts to the attention of producers and educators;</li>

     playwrights;</li>
<li>Provide students and new dramatists with models of
     plays that have proven popular with audiences;</li>

     these plays.</li>
</ul>
<p>This year PlayGround is expanding
the role of these books to help move the work of its talented emerging writers

THE
BACKSTORY
Since 1994, the mission of
PlayGround has been to support the development of new voices for the theatre.
For over two decades, PlayGround has been a leading playwright incubator,
providing unique opportunities for the cultivation and development of
early-career local playwrights and partnerships with leading professional
directors, actors, theatres and theatre lovers. In 2012, PlayGround expanded to
Los Angeles with the launch of PlayGround-LA and its inaugural season in
residence at the Zephyr Theatre.
Through the development of original
short (and now full-length) plays, PlayGround-LA creates a microcosm of the
greater theatre scene, supporting emerging playwrights' experimentation and
risk-taking, while helping them hone their style and technique.
PUBLISH
OR PERISH
For the past fifteen years,
PlayGround Publications has promoted the work of scores of emerging new
playwrights and their short plays through the Best of PlayGround series
of anthologies.
This month, PlayGround Publications
will print two new Best of PlayGround 2016 anthologies. You can help us
in this mission by pre-ordering copies of the Los Angeles book through this
Indiegogo funding campaign.
The book contains six scripts as
performed at this year’s Best of PlayGround Gala new plays showcase (May 9,
2016). These six plays were selected as the best this season from more than 160
submissions and thirty-six works developed through the Monday Night PlayGround
staged reading series.
Each script is printed in its
entirety, creating an historical record of the development of these plays, with
dates of first reading and premiere, original casting information and
playwright biographies.
Proceeds of this funding campaign
will be used exclusively to print and distribute the Best of PlayGround-Los
Angeles anthology.
The Best of PlayGround
anthologies:

Celebrate the best short plays of the past season;
Provide an economical way to bring high-quality
     audience-tested scripts to the attention of producers and educators;
Promote the work of new generations of talented
     playwrights;
Provide students and new dramatists with models of
     plays that have proven popular with audiences;
Creates an historical record of the development of
     these plays.

This year PlayGround is expanding
the role of these books to help move the work of its talented emerging writers
from page and into production.
The 2016 Los Angeles anthology
contains complete scripts of the following plays:
She Has Seen the Wolf by Allie Costa
A New Happily Ever After by Vincent Terrell Durham
Bright Shining Sea by Julianne Jigour
Antic Resolutions by Arthur Keng
Psycho by Jessica June Rowe
Goodnight Joanne by Nicki Spencer

<h2>Bringing ESDO Back to the Stage</h2>
<p>This campaign is raising funds to bring my play <i>Eyes Shut.

This new production of ESDO will feature our same original team of talented actors, Victor Shopov, Michael James Underhill, and Melissa deJesus, and returning director, Christopher Randolph. Remounting ESDO with the help of this campaign will allow us to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>1. Bring ESDO to a wider audience given its larger scale, longer run, and more centrally located venue, and create more opportunities for people to see the play that missed its first, shorter run.</p>
<p>2. Fully realize ESDO on a more flexible budget. This means more developed lighting, set and sound design, and a more accessible venue in a vibrant neighborhood. </p>
<p>3. Stimulate the local artist economy by paying actors, designers, crew and a venue for their time and work. </p>

<h3></h3>
<p>Through the New Traditions Festival, DCC is committed to presenting concert dance works rooted in Caribbean cultural traditions and experiences, that can connect to the Caribbean-American community through workshops, classes and education programs. This year we have chosen five local choreographers and two featured choreographers to develop and present work for New Traditions 2016, who align with this mission. </p>
<p><b>The featured  choreographers are Chris Walker and Kevin Ormsby in ‘Facing Home: Love and Redemption’</b>, a contemporary dance concert that investigates the global impact of Bob Marley’s music—its expression of humanity’s struggle and inspiration toward love, redemption and hope—and the active, deep-rooted homophobia in Jamaican/West Indian Culture, and <b>o</b><strong>ur 5 local artists are<br/><span>Candace Thompson, Jessica St. Vil, Maxine Montilus, Safi Harriott and Shola Roberts. </span></strong></p>
<p>These artists are also serving as leaders in their communities, teaching workshops at schools and community organisations to inspire our youth. <span>We need your support to give the New Traditions Artists the opportunity to present their work at the highest level. We invite you to join us in bringing this festival to life by contributing to this groundbreaking campaign! </span></p>

</div></div>","Dance Caribbean COLLECTIVE (DCC) is an organization dedicated to bringing and facilitating Caribbean Dance works, performances and culture to the Caribbean Diaspora in the US and more specifically Brooklyn, NY. We are raising $3500 towards the New Traditions Festival 2016, our acclaimed dance production held during Caribbean Heritage Month.



Through the New Traditions Festival, DCC is committed to presenting concert dance works rooted in Caribbean cultural traditions and experiences, that can connect to the Caribbean-American community through workshops, classes and education programs. This year we have chosen five local choreographers and two featured choreographers to develop and present work for New Traditions 2016, who align with this mission. 
The featured  choreographers are Chris Walker and Kevin Ormsby in ‘Facing Home: Love and Redemption’, a contemporary dance concert that investigates the global impact of Bob Marley’s music—its expression of humanity’s struggle and inspiration toward love, redemption and hope—and the active, deep-rooted homophobia in Jamaican/West Indian Culture, and our 5 local artists areCandace Thompson, Jessica St. Vil, Maxine Montilus, Safi Harriott and Shola Roberts. 
These artists are also serving as leaders in their communities, teaching workshops at schools and community organisations to inspire our youth. We need your support to give the New Traditions Artists the opportunity to present their work at the highest level. We invite you to join us in bringing this festival to life by contributing to this groundbreaking campaign! 
#DanceYourCaribbean by ensuring that our culture stays alive through these artists.

<p><b>LIT PRODUCTIONS is and all encompassing playground for ideas and experiments. Join Us.</b></p>
<p>Our first production will be “In the Heights”.  The show will be running March 9-13 in the Student Center at Purchase College.</p>
<p>“IN THE HEIGHTS tells the universal story of a vibrant community in New York’s Washington Heights neighborhood – a place where the coffee from the corner bodega is light and sweet, the windows are always open and the breeze carries the rhythm of three generations of music. It’s a community on the brink of change, full of hopes, dreams and pressures, where the biggest struggles can be deciding which traditions you take with you, and which ones you leave behind. IN THE HEIGHTS is the winner of the 2008 Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Score, Best Choreography and Best Orchestrations.” — Rodgers and Hammerstein</p>

Our first production will be “In the Heights”.  The show will be running March 9-13 in the Student Center at Purchase College.
“IN THE HEIGHTS tells the universal story of a vibrant community in New York’s Washington Heights neighborhood – a place where the coffee from the corner bodega is light and sweet, the windows are always open and the breeze carries the rhythm of three generations of music. It’s a community on the brink of change, full of hopes, dreams and pressures, where the biggest struggles can be deciding which traditions you take with you, and which ones you leave behind. IN THE HEIGHTS is the winner of the 2008 Tony Awards for Best Musical, Best Score, Best Choreography and Best Orchestrations.” — Rodgers and Hammerstein

<p><strong>Our continuing MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Now well into our third season, we still wholeheartedly believe and full-throatedly proclaim our belief that:</p>
<p>In an age where the notion of “neighborhood” is fast evolving into a series of intangible on-line social media webpages, A Public Fit aims to reinvigorate the tangible community by working with emerging Las Vegas artists to create exciting, innovative and provocative professional theater. APF believes strongly in the communal power of great stories, dramatic ideas and the sincere engagement that audiences find in challenging theatrical events. A Public Fit genuinely hopes to unite professional artists and audiences through the most effective form of human connection, treating each production as the beginning of an unending conversation.</p>
<p><i>“To see what exquisite acting and directing are all about, buy your ticket now before they’re gone.  This is theatre at its best.”</i></p>
<p>-Mary LaFance, Talkin’ Broadway</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.talkinbroadway.com/page/regional/lasvegas/lv29.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.talkinbroadway.com/page/regional/lasvegas/l...</a></p>
<p>As before, the staff of APF will be working merely to cover their expenses in order to make absolutely certain that the performers and behind-the-scenes artists get paid first.  Our everlasting cry:  A Public Fit respects artists too much to ask them to work for free.</p>

<p><strong>Our recent PAST</strong></p>
<p>A Public Fit’s on-going series of free monthly staged readings captured the imagination of an ever-growing audience of theatre aficionados who braved SRO crowds.  Our first fully-realized production, Dawn King’s “Foxfinder”, was met with critical and commercial success, selling out its November 2014 run and garnering 11 Las Vegas Valley Theatre Award nominations - including wins for Best Play, Best Director and Best Lighting Design - nominations in every category for which it was eligible.  The following season, APF challenged the very role of the audience itself with its world-premiere production of “A Summons from the Tinker to Assemble the Membership in Secret at the Usual Place”, an original piece that once again dominated the Valley Awards, winning Best Ensemble Cast as well as the coveted Audience Choice Award.  APF’s second show that year, Gina Gionfriddo’s modern comedy “Becky Shaw”, saw multiple acting nominations as well.  And the first mainstage production of our 2016-2017 season, Andrew Bovell’s “When the Rain Stops Falling” left audiences gasping.  This is the kind of flat-out, take-no-prisoners theatre that A Public Fit continues to thrive on.  And it’s why APF was named Best Theatre Company in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Weekly immediately following our inaugural season.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our spectacular FUTURE</strong></p>
<p>Two mainstage productions and three staged readings remain in our 2016-2017 season.  In February, A Public Fit will produce Martin McDonagh’s “The Beauty Queen of Leenane.”  Set in a small country village in Connemara, county Galway, Ireland, this blackest of black comedies depicts the decades-old struggle for power and independence between a 40-year-old spinster and her wry, devious, 70-year-old mother.  It is suspenseful, compelling and unexpectedly funny as it builds with unrelenting tension towards an unforgettable and inevitable climax.  “The Realistic Joneses”, our final mainstage production of 2017, opens in May.  This funny, moving and wonderfully weird play by Will Eno is a tantalizing conversation about the perplexing business of being alive.  The Joneses share so much more than identical homes and common last names as idyllic fantasy and harsh reality clash.</p>

</div></div>","Our continuing MISSION
Now well into our third season, we still wholeheartedly believe and full-throatedly proclaim our belief that:
In an age where the notion of “neighborhood” is fast evolving into a series of intangible on-line social media webpages, A Public Fit aims to reinvigorate the tangible community by working with emerging Las Vegas artists to create exciting, innovative and provocative professional theater. APF believes strongly in the communal power of great stories, dramatic ideas and the sincere engagement that audiences find in challenging theatrical events. A Public Fit genuinely hopes to unite professional artists and audiences through the most effective form of human connection, treating each production as the beginning of an unending conversation.
“To see what exquisite acting and directing are all about, buy your ticket now before they’re gone.  This is theatre at its best.”
-Mary LaFance, Talkin’ Broadway
www.talkinbroadway.com/page/regional/lasvegas/l...
As before, the staff of APF will be working merely to cover their expenses in order to make absolutely certain that the performers and behind-the-scenes artists get paid first.  Our everlasting cry:  A Public Fit respects artists too much to ask them to work for free.

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;text-align: center;"">The Importance of Theatre in Our Community</h3>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;text-align: left;""><br/>What excites us most about working with young performers is that children are natural masters at playing make-believe and utilizing their imaginations, which makes them inherently talented performers. Unfortunately, as children mature, the spaces in which they are allowed to touch base with that creativity become limited. We believe that the rehearsal room is a place in which it should be safe for everyone, regardless of age, to revisit that unique sense of play. We gladly recognize any performer who is willing to explore new things, and encourage shyer individuals to trust their instincts. It is our goal that each cast member leaves our process knowing that there is something special inside of them, and we consider it our job as theatre educators to foster the confidence that will allow them to share that with others. In this way, theatre fulfills one of the core values of Christ Church: <b>LIVING joyfully in faith.<br/></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><br/>Whether or not a child intends to pursue a career in the arts, exposure to theatre shapes important fundamentals, one of which is learning to function within a group. In our ensemble-based rehearsal process, it is extremely important that our performers not only learn to shine in the spotlight, but also to be great teammates - and occasionally audience members - along the way. In collaborating with each other, and also by exploring and interacting with unfamiliar settings and characters, performers will learn to see others' points of view, and to discuss the resulting emotions in healthy and constructive ways. This upholds another value of Christ Church: </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">CONNECTING with God and one another.<br/></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b>It is our wish to never turn away an aspiring performer due to their inability to pay a program fee. To date, we have offered almost $2,000 in scholarships and waived fees to our participants. As you will read below, this is one of the reasons we hope to raise funds for our 2016-2017 season. No child should ever be told that they cannot afford to express themselves artistically, and as a society, we cannot afford to go without creative, well-rounded, and emotionally-intelligent youth. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Combined with providing quality family entertainment for our audience members, we fulfill the third value of Christ Church: </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">SERVING the local and global community.<br/><br/></b></p>

The Christ Church Players are a reemergence of youth theatre at Christ Episcopal Church in Exeter, New Hampshire. In the past, the youth theatre program created a safe space for children and teens to discover new truths about themselves, each other, and the world around them, and to share those truths with the community through the art of theatre.Founded by Suzanne Jalbert Jones, Director of Music at Christ Church, and her longtime collaborator Lexi Meunier, the newly-dubbed Christ Church Players serves as an important outreach ministry for young performers in the Exeter area, though many of its cast and audience are not members of the church. It is the belief of CCP that exposure to the performing arts helps to build the foundation of well-rounded and well-adjusted individuals for the betterment of our community.




... and who are Suzi & Lexi?

Suzanne Jalbert Jones has served as the music director and choral conductor for numerous theatre companies and churches throughout New Hampshire and Massachusetts. She currently directs the Christ Church Choir and Junior Choir, is on the faculty of the Performing Arts Connection in Sudbury, MA, and offers private lessons through her voice and piano studio. She is passionate about 19th and 20th century choral music and musical theatre, and was nominated for Best Musical Direction at the 2013 and 2014 EMACT DASH Awards. Suzanne holds a BM in Classical Voice Performance from the New England Conservatory of Music, as well as a Masters in Choral Conducting from the University of New Hampshire.Lexi Meunier began her theatrical career fifteen years ago in her hometown of Derry, New Hampshire, performing with programs much like CCP! A graduate of the Portland Actors Conservatory in Portland, Oregon, Lexi is on the faculty of the Performing Arts Connection in Sudbury, MA, and she serves as the Director of Theatre Education for the Haverhill branch of the North Shore YMCA Theatre Company. Lexi is currently studying English with a Theatre Arts concentration and Education minor at the University of Massachusetts: Lowell.Suzi and Lexi share the belief that exposure to the performing arts is extremely beneficial to youth, as it fosters emotional intelligence and communicative abilities, encourages a strong awareness of self and others, and increases both self-discipline and self-confidence. Best friends for over a decade, Suzi and Lexi have worked together both onstage and behind the scenes of numerous productions, and they are so very thrilled with the opportunity to share their love and knowledge of theatre with up-and-coming performers!




""Impossible Things Are Happening Every Day!""

Last fall, CCP mounted its debut production of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella, a show that was chosen in hopes that the story's popularity would help garner interest in this unknown theatre company. Maybe a dozen performers would be enough for a worthwhile production? Would we be lucky enough to have a full ensemble with twenty?Much to our surprise and elation, over fifty young performers auditioned for Cinderella, and we were blown away by not only the quantity of performers, but also by the quality; from the moment auditions began, we were met with so much enthusiasm, energy, and raw talent that we were left feeling giddily overwhelmed. We ultimately decided to accept every performer who was brave enough to audition, splitting the performers into two casts based on age. This allowed our older performers to be challenged, and our younger performers to take a turn in the spotlight. Both spirited casts absolutely blew away their audiences. Parents, performers, and patrons raved - and continue to rave! - about Cinderella, and it is with their support and encouragement that we embark on a full theatrical season.""My husband and I have been so impressed by all your effort and care that you put into this show from the very beginning. Your communication with us and care of our children was truly outstanding! ... You created a lovely community there, and it showed both onstage and off. I have told many people just how impressed I've been with your professionalism as well as creating an environment for our children to feel nurtured, encouraged, and creative.""""The girls absolutely LOVED being a part of Cinderella and still sing the songs all the time. (One even constructed ""her own little corner"" in her room, and I find her singing there quite often!) For both of them, the show provided a real window to discovery of interests and talents that they didn't know they had. What a gift! ... Beyond the performance, the whole experience of team-building was so positive - what a great group of kids and what a wonderful culture of support.""""I just wanted to let you know how impressed my husband and I were with the entire production of Cinderella. ... I had no idea that this play would be such a positive and, in all honestly, life-changing experience for her! She loved every minute of it. She couldn't wait for play practice ... and just took on all responsibilities without needing us to nag her. She has officially been bitten by the acting bug and can't wait to be part of another production! ... Thank you so much for providing such a wonderful experience for our daughter and all of the kids that took part in the plays. There is nothing better than watching your child do what they love!""


The Importance of Theatre in Our Community
What excites us most about working with young performers is that children are natural masters at playing make-believe and utilizing their imaginations, which makes them inherently talented performers. Unfortunately, as children mature, the spaces in which they are allowed to touch base with that creativity become limited. We believe that the rehearsal room is a place in which it should be safe for everyone, regardless of age, to revisit that unique sense of play. We gladly recognize any performer who is willing to explore new things, and encourage shyer individuals to trust their instincts. It is our goal that each cast member leaves our process knowing that there is something special inside of them, and we consider it our job as theatre educators to foster the confidence that will allow them to share that with others. In this way, theatre fulfills one of the core values of Christ Church: LIVING joyfully in faith.Whether or not a child intends to pursue a career in the arts, exposure to theatre shapes important fundamentals, one of which is learning to function within a group. In our ensemble-based rehearsal process, it is extremely important that our performers not only learn to shine in the spotlight, but also to be great teammates - and occasionally audience members - along the way. In collaborating with each other, and also by exploring and interacting with unfamiliar settings and characters, performers will learn to see others' points of view, and to discuss the resulting emotions in healthy and constructive ways. This upholds another value of Christ Church: CONNECTING with God and one another.It is our wish to never turn away an aspiring performer due to their inability to pay a program fee. To date, we have offered almost $2,000 in scholarships and waived fees to our participants. As you will read below, this is one of the reasons we hope to raise funds for our 2016-2017 season. No child should ever be told that they cannot afford to express themselves artistically, and as a society, we cannot afford to go without creative, well-rounded, and emotionally-intelligent youth. Combined with providing quality family entertainment for our audience members, we fulfill the third value of Christ Church: SERVING the local and global community.


Your Donation Will Go Towards ...SCHOLARSHIPSThe first $2,000 raised by this campaign will be set aside solely for scholarships. No performer is ever turned away from CCP due to an inability to pay a performance fee. In exchange for a letter discussing why theatre is important to them, all performers are eligible for waived fees or full scholarships.LICENSING RIGHTS
We must pay a fee for each show we produce; the more performances we offer, the higher the fee. It is important to us to offer multiple performances during each show, not only to reach as many audience members as possible (Cinderella sold out almost every night!), but also to give our casts as many special memories as possible. More often than not, we pay over $1,000 just for the right to mount a show. We hope to produce five shows this season, including our three summer workshops, and much of this campaign will assist in paying licensing rights.
COSTUMES
As we did with Cinderella, we hope to work with as many performers as possible this season. Unfortunately, when we accept so many performers, our costume budget absolutely explodes! Our generous and skilled Wardrobe Volunteers are able to work wonders, but we still require funds for sewing materials and thrift-shop finds! Please help us to ensure that every performer feels like a star.
LIGHTS & MICROPHONESChrist Church, while stunning, is not equipped for full theatrical productions, and we are required to rent lights and microphones for each show. These vital elements certainly add up quickly.

FALL of 2016
On the heels of our highly-successful production of Cinderella, we will produce another large-scale, mainstage musical this coming fall. It is our hope to once again have the means to accept every performer who auditions, and mount another colorful, whimsical, energetic production!

<h2>Let's Keep Live Theatre Alive!</h2>
<h3><strong>Hello, dear friends!</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Dan Kostelec, and I’m the guy who plays your<a href=""http://facebook.com/shakespeareapproves"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong>friendly, neighbourhood Shakespeare</strong></a> at Renaissance Faires, schools and more all over the country in my one-man, audience-interactive, improvisational Shakespeare show, “<a href=""http://shakespeareapproves.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shakespeare Approves!</a>” I take some of the Bard’s plays and turn them into half-hour, live-action, interactive cartoons where the audience members are the actors, props, and scenery.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has shut down everything, renaissance faires and theaters included - and some of the most vulnerable people in our increasingly-gig-based economy are your favorite performers in theatre and renaissance festivals.</p>
<p>Piggy-backing on the success of the first three shows (<strong><i>12th Night &amp; the 3 Bears!, Romeo &amp; Juliet: The Flying Implement of Doom Edition!, Julius Caesar: Beware the Ides March of the Penguins!, and A Midsummer Night's Dream: A Gaye Olde Tyme!</i></strong>) performed by our new online theatre company, <a href=""http://facebook.com/socialdistancingplayers"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Social Distancing Players</strong></a> , we're back with our fifth performance of online, irreverent, quasi-improvisational, audience-interactive family fun with <i><strong>Macbeth: Death by Fluffy Kittens!</strong></i></p>
<p>Actors from various theatre companies and some of your favorite Ren Faire acts will be performing a live reading adapted from my stage show that is normally produced at festivals as an audience-interactive, improvisational show.</p>
<p>I'm looking to raise at least $1,100.00 for this performance, so that I can guarantee each performer a minimum of $100 (and hopefully more!) for their time in bringing us joy and laughter. And that's where you come in. We need your help to make it happen!</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need $1,100. Okay - that part was pretty straight-forward</p>
<p>What do you get?</p>
<p>A part in the show! And also much more!</p>
<p>If you're familiar with my live, in-person ren faire show, you know that I use the audience members as my cast, the set, even as some of the props. So keeping with that tradition, if you are able to donate to this cause, the first 5 people to donate $50 or more will get to be in the show (all roles are first-come, first served). Yeah, it sounds like pay-to-play, because it is. But if you can afford it, I guarantee that you'll have a marvelous time!</p>
<p><u><strong>Roles Available</strong></u></p>
<p><b>King Duncan     Prince Malcolm     Macduff's Family     The King's Messenger</b></p>
<p><b>Prince Donalbain     Lady Macduff     The Army</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>But wait — there’s more!</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say you have some cash but can’t afford to go up to $50. For $10 you can get a ""seat at the show""! You'll have the best seat in the house - your house! - but can join the actors ""backstage"" before and after the show in our private Zoom meeting, and interact with the actors and your fellow audience members in a private chat. Plus, you're seeing the show 45 seconds before the folks on Facebook and YouTube!</p>
<p>Well, for $30 you can get a copy of the performance script signed by the author (that’s me!).</p>
<p>And if you’re feeling particularly generous and want to donate $100 - well, you get some goodies! You get the signed performance script, a part in the show (if you desire, and if they haven’t been snatched up yet — all roles are first-come, first served), AND a personalized sonnet commissioned JUST FOR YOU (a $20 value).</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will directly be helping professional entertainers keep ""professional"" as part of their job title, by helping us to pay our bills, buy our groceries (when we dare to venture outside during this social distancing period), and not sink deeper into poverty or credit card debt.</p>
<p>You're helping to extend hope and build morale for our fellow members of humanity by giving them a much-needed distraction during this crisis, a sense that a return-to-normal is not just possible but inevitable.</p>
<p>You're keeping live theatre alive.<br/> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><br/>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<br/>Share this campaign with your friends, family, even enemies!</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>
<p>Thank you. I love you - you love me - there is mutual, glorious affection!</p>

<div>Hi! My name is Michael Dreger &amp; I'm a recent graduate from Cornish College's Original Works program. I've used Indiegogo previously to raise funds for 3 different theatre productions, affording each: costumes, set pieces, &amp; stipends for our production team...<br/>
</div>
<div>And I'm back at it again!!! With a story. That is. Incredible!!</div>
<div>Crafted by Heather L. Earnhardt, <i>The Wandering Goose</i> is a poignant piece on love, set to the tone of a children's fable. It follows relationship of a Bug in her garden &amp; a wandering Goose, as they explore what it means to love &amp; lose.</div>
<div>It comes alive onstage as a theatrical adaptation by Clara Hayes &amp; myself. I am currently working with an awesome team of actors &amp; designers, bringing this story to live as vibrantly as it sits on the page!! But we need help!!</div>
<div>I believe in paying artists for their work &amp; make it my goal every project to make sure my team is compensated. Any donations to this project will serve to pay for costumes, set, &amp; hard working artists!!</div>

<h3><strong><i>House Play</i> a new play by Diana Lynn Small will have its world premiere in Austin, TX in June 2019 by Salvage Vanguard Theater. </strong></h3>
<p>Like its preceding show, <i>Mad &amp; a Goat</i>, <i>House Play</i> is being developed with artists across the country--James Hapke / Marie Ponce / Paige Tautz in California, Heather Johnson in Colorado,  Kate Taylor in Texas, and Diana Lynn Small / Tyler Gobble in Indiana. Following February's workshop in Indiana and June's premiere in Texas, the show will be toured to a variety of hometowns &amp; beloved locations, with an emphasis on places without traditional theaters. </p>
<p><strong>We’re gathering in Elwood, IN in February 2020 to rehearse the play and share it with a preview audience for the first time. We're raising money to help support this final workshop and to launch the play after its premiere. </strong></p>
<p><i>House Play</i> is a new play performed around your dinner table. Part meal and part fairy tale, <i>House Play</i> is a dark comedy that follows three young girls who have been left for dead in the woods as they adopt new identities in order to survive: a Woman, an Animal and a Sibyl. It’s like if <i>Lord of the Flies</i> was a dark comedy, used household items as puppets, and featured female characters. </p>

<p>We need your help to fund our <strong>Workshop Production in Indiana ($2000)</strong> and to fund the first chapter of our <strong>House Tour <i>after</i> the Austin, TX premiere ($3000).</strong> These expenses help cover travel, artist fees and show supplies:</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>House Play</i> will transform dining room tables into imaginative storytelling spaces, focused on towns that don't have access to new plays and experimental art. The play will be toured, granting the artists and audiences opportunities to meet new folks ""in the middle of nowhere"" places. We believe that people fall in love over good food and stories. We’d like to be responsible for more of that. </p>
<p>While the Austin premiere is covered by support from Salvage Vanguard Theater, your support will allow us to tighten up the show before that important run, as well as get us financially ahead for the small-towns tour at the heart of the show; this stability will allow us to confidently take the show to other communities in need of experimental art experiences</p>

<h2>CITY OF LIGHT - SEANCES, SPIRITS, AND LIGHT OPERA?</h2>
<p><span>Hello! My name is Michael McFaden, and I am the author of the book and lyrics for the new light opera, <em>City of Light.  </em>Part fact, part fiction, <em>City of Light </em>explores the continuity of life after death as experienced in the tiny community of Lily Dale, New York, through the lesser-known music of Sir Arthur Sullivan. </span></p>
<p><span>So, what is Lily Dale? Founded in the 1870's as a summer camp, and a favorite locale of Susan B. Anthony to hold suffragette rallies, Lily Dale became a mecca for free-thinkers, as well as the home of the Spiritualist religion.   Harry Houdini actively persecuted the mediums of Lily Dale in order to expose frauds, but Sir Arthur Canon Doyle was an ardent believer.  Even Hollywood legend Mae West consulted one of Lily Dale's most famous mediums on a regular basis.  Today, Lily Dale is a quiet village, a shadow of its former self.  Yet, the curious still visit.  And in 2010, I was one of the curious.</span></p>
<p><span>Sparked by my fascination with Lily Dale and combined with a keen interest in the operettas of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, I conceived the idea of writing a light opera in the style of that famous duo, using Lily Dale as the backdrop.  I started researching Sullivan's music - specifically compositions he wrote apart from Gilbert.  And from the scores of six light operas, one grand opera, two religious oratorios and one part song, <em>City of Light </em>was born, helping to preserve the music of Sir Arthur Sullivan by presenting to the public an entirely new Sullivan score.  Most people only know Sullivan's music through the combined works of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan.  Yet Sullivan was a very prolific composer outside of that famous collaboration.  Most of his music outside of the G&amp;S canon is forgotten today, buried in obsolete works difficult to revive.  But <em>City of Light </em>allows some of these lost jewels to shine once again and, hopefully, will help to create a new appreciation for this Victorian composer. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><span><img alt=""Arthur Sullivan"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/944685/pictures/original/20130723134511-is.jpeg?1374612310"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span>Last year<em> City of Light</em> won the first new musical competition sponsored by the Boiler Room Theatre in Franklin, TN.  The prize is to be a full production at the Boiler Room Theatre this September (2013).  However, the theatre is not going to be able to handle all of the production costs.  The Boiler Room is providing the performance space, online advertising, front of house support, and the like.  But all sets, costumes and lighting are limited to what the theatre has on hand. I am responsible for any additional costs such as musical arrangements, rehearsal space rental, specialty set pieces and costumes, and any additional promotion.</span></p>
<p><span>Most importantly, if the individual actors and musicians are to be compensated, that money will also have to be raised by me.  <em>City of Light </em>has a cast of about twenty, plus four musicians.  Many of these people have been with this project since its first readings early last year.  And in some cases, actors commute as many as ninety miles for rehearsals.  Up until now, I have been unable to offer any of these individuals any compensation at all for their time and talent.  Your donations will help show my appreciation for their commitment and hard work.  Artists deserve to be compensated.  And that, my friends, is why I need your help.</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>What we need and what you get</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Launching a new musical is a monumental undertaking.  Few theatres are willing to take risks with unknown, untried works; even Broadway seems to be producing only adaptations from the movies.  So to get a local theatre with an established reputation to take a chance on something new is very exciting.  This production will help provide the groundwork needed to take <em>City of Light </em>even further in the future.  But, stated bluntly, producing a show requires finances.</span></p>
<p><span>The amount we are shooting for is $6,000.  That really is not a whole lot of money to produce a big musical, but I am trying to keep the goal achievable.  Once the expenses of mounting the show have been achieved, the remainder of the money will go directly to the musicians and the actors.  In essence, look at your contribution as sponsoring an artist.  If the goal is surpassed, then there will be more to share with those who are giving so generously of their time and talents.  I am keeping none of this money for myself.  Please remember that Indiegogo keeps 4% of any monies raised. (And if the goal is not achieved, Indiegogo keeps 9%.)  So every dollar helps.  I encourage you to give what you can.</span></p>
<p><span>For you, the donors, I have tried to come up with an interesting array of unique perks - Lily Dale souvenirs, cast recordings of the show, tickets to the performances of <em>City of</em> <em>Light</em>, and telephone readings with a registered Lily Dale medium.  Four donors at the top level will even receive a stay in this lovely cottage on the grounds of Lily Dale! </span></p>

<p>My Name is Gabriel Gastelo and I am an undergraduate dance major at Arizona State University. I have been working on the production crew for the school of dance for the last school year. I hope with this adventure to ADF I can bring back all the knowledge and experience I gain at ADF back to my ASU community! With this campaign you will be helping my get across the country via car! I will be traveling from Tempe, Arizona to Durham, North Carolina!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I set a goal of $600 for the trip, this would cover the cost of gas to drive across the county and back home again! The trip will take over 32 hours of travel time, and the distance is roughly 2,150 miles of travel. I choose to go via a car in hopes to document my travels, something that I will share with all those who would like to contribute!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In preperation for this trip I applied for a grant from ASU and was awarded $1600 to cover room and board whiile I am there. I will also get a stipend from ADF for working as a production intern which will total $1100, and that money will go to covering my expenses in AZ for the two months that I am away.</p>
<p>When I applied for this internship initially I was contacted and told that the positions have been filed. I was then offered a stage craft apprentiship postition instead (which was not a stipend positon), I was then contacted about a month ago and was told that one of the Production Interns was unable to commit to the summer. So then I was offered that persons spot, and I gladly expected! Things for this venture have fallen nicely in place, and I hope this campaign will be one of those things!</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://thebulletin.org/2018-doomsday-clock-statement"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2018 Doomsday Clock</a> says it is ""2 Minutes to Midnight.""</p>
<p>Scum says “<i>Game on.</i>""</p>
<h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
<p>It all began in a Washington Heights Apartment in March 2018, when Sarah Shear gathered her friends together for a reading of a play she had recently finished. This first read only confirmed what we already believed - that this play was not only enjoyable and compelling, but a poignant, humorous, thought-provoking story about four friends doing their best to survive in unimaginable conditions. People needed to see this play, and we needed to make it happen.</p>
<p>With Sarah's initiative, a team was assembled (like the post-apocalyptic theatre Avengers) to get the play up on its feet. We had our first public reading of the play at The Chipped Cup on April 14th, 2018 and the response we received was absolutely overwhelming. People responded to these characters, as if they could easily be their own friends, and found themselves questioning what their own survival instincts would be in the apocalypse. It was an enthusiasm that matched our own, so we knew it was time to give this play the fully-staged production it deserves. And as the characters in the play teach us, there is no time like the present</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Big Hurdle</h3>
<p>The only thing standing in our way now is the price tag. We need a performance space, rehearsal space, props, costumes, lights, crew, and actors. We believe in compensating everyone for the time, energy, and talent it takes to put on a quality show. While we will be a non-union production, the Scum Team refuses to ask people to work for free. This has become a crucial component in our need to fundraise.</p>
<p>We've created a budget for the production, as outlined below:</p>
<p>Performance Space: $2,500<br/>Rehearsal Space (55 hours): $1,000<br/>Set, Costumes, Props: $500<br/>Stipends (divided between Actors, Production Team, Designers): $1,200<br/>Marketing: $300</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What It Means To Us</h3>
<p>""Aside from being passionate about women telling women’s stories, what’s exciting about Scum is the immediacy of the piece. We’ve heard “I know these people” over and over again, wherever Scum goes. Toxicity is addressed through this piece fearlessly and asks the audience, “So what do we do now? How can we make the world a better place?” And somehow it’s funny, too! It’s an incredibly special piece and I’m excited to share our 2023 with 2018."" - Sarah Shear, Playwright</p>
<p>""I love the raw energy of Scum - it cooks, pummeling you with its dialogue. By the end, once the dust settles, what you're left with is actually a very tender, earnest warning about the ride we just took. And where it might be heading if continue on it."" - Javan Nelson, Director</p>
<p>""Beyond the fact that I love this piece, it is so exciting to be a part of team producing new work written by a female artist who writes such fleshed out, honest characters. You really feel like you know these people, and the journey they go on challenges the audience as much as it challenges them. New work is the backbone of our industry, and it's a joy and an honor to be a part of the process of bringing it to life."" - Becca Barrett, Marketing Producer</p>
<p>""This project brings out parts of the friends and acquaintances I have made that I never would have seen otherwise. I can't think of anything more important or essential to the world of theater than a work that can do that."" - Ross Lampert, Executive Producer and Dramaturg</p>

<p>Brave Spirits Theatre, the Washington DC Metropolitan area’s premiere producer
of little-known early modern plays, is proud to announce an (almost) entirely re-gendered production of both parts of Shakespeare’s classic coming-of-age saga, <i>Henry the Fourth</i>.</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">""Washington is blessed to have young, creative, multi-talented emerging companies like Brave Spirits here."" -- MD Theatre Guide</h4>
<p>In <i>Part One</i>, Queen Henri has a problem -- she faces rebellion from the north, from the Countess of Northumberland and her daughter, Hotspur; and in the west the “wild and irregular” Glendower plots her own insurrection. Civil war is on the horizon, and Henri’s tenuous claim to the throne is threatened -- but that’s nothing compared to her problems at home. Hallie, Henri’s eldest daughter
and heir, is less interested in affairs of state than in carousing around the seedy London neighborhood of Eastcheap with her friend, Jill Falstaff. Part One culminates in an epic battle between the Henri’s forces and the rebels.</p>
<p>In <i>Part Two</i>, military drama takes a backseat to the issues of the family. As Henri nears death, she worries about Hallie’s ability to lead the nation she is leaving behind. Falstaff’s comic exploits in the Gloucester countryside lighten the mood, and the play ends on a bittersweet note as the young Hallie comes into her own as Henri V.</p>
<h3>Support Female Artists</h3>
<p>Besides gender-flipping the characters and performing the two plays with a cast of ten women and two men, Brave Spirits has assembled a production and design team that is 80% comprised of female artists.</p>
<p>In these productions, women get to play iconic Shakespeare roles, make jokes, fight fight for what they believe in, talk about sex, grow up, get angry, get passionate, sing songs, ruminate on getting older, and argue about what's best for a family and what's best for a country.</p>
<p>This is our largest production team and most ambitious project and will cost around $13,000. Ticket sales will only cover a portion of our expenses, especially as we are committed to affordable ticket prices. The campaign amount is focused on helping pay stipends to the actors. The actors will have put in up to 150 hours of rehearsal time each once we open. Please help us support the work they do.</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">""[Brave Spirits has a] kick-ass mission."" -- DCMTA</h4>
<p>Employment opportunities for women in the theatre do not meet the percentage of women in the general population. The numbers are even lower for women trying to work in the classical theatre. Your support helps Brave Spirits continue to take on projects of this magnitude and enables a greater number of female artists to perform in and design for the works of Shakespeare.</p>

<h3>About Adoration</h3>
<p>Two former violin students reconnect after the suicide of their mentor. Loosely based on The Seagull by Anton Chekhov, Adoration pieces together the non-linear tales and imperfect lives of two generations of musicians: their compromises, their quiet victories, and their take on what it means to be an artist.</p>
<p>We at Tantalus are independent theatre artists devoted to building community through our works, while creating theatre that challenges convention and that stems from the question of what our responsibilities are as human beings. <br/>Through this campaign, we aim to build the funds required to make our remount of Adoration as successful as possible, in hopes of providing work that makes our audiences think critically on subjects such as the importance of the teacher-student relationship, while looking at the silent sacrifices that artists make time and time again. </p>
<p>For a project like this, the support of the community is paramount. Help us tell the story that so many artists can relate to. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Generosity Gets You. </h3>
<p>For this remount, we are asking the community for 700$. With this money, we can ensure that Adoration runs smoothly.<br/><br/>This 700$ will go towards audio recording sessions, printing costs, promotional material, and any repairs that may be necessary with our set or props. </p>
<p>Your contributions to our production will not go unrewarded. When it comes to independent theatre, every dollar goes a long way, and we want you to be rewarded for your help. Our perks for this campaign range from <strong>social media shoutouts</strong>, to <strong>personalized videos</strong> from our cast and crew, to <strong>digital copies of the beautiful music from the show</strong>, composed and performed by our very own playwright, Violette Kay.

<p>An all-female cast, crew and co-production team present this play by April De Angelis, uncovering how women struggle to be and not to be represented on the stage, as well as how they work, endure and thrive behind the scenes. </p>
<p>2016 has been called “the year of women in theatre” – with movements to advance equity in theatre production, casting, staffing, pay and opportunity. Yet for today’s female artists, making a living can be a constant hustle between freelancing, teaching, day-jobbing, seeking child-care or relying on others for financial stability in the creative pursuit of “this thing one gives one’s life blood for.”</p>
<p>Your fiscal sponsorship of <i>Playhouse Creatures</i> will help ensure the longevity of our female artists as well as contribute to the operating needs of our production.</p>
<p>Join CoHo Productions, along with Brenan Dwyer and McKenna Twedt, in creating this uniquely feminine theatrical experience that celebrates the everlasting tenacity of women artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need You!</h3>
<p>Your contribution to <i>Playhouse Creatures</i> will ensure support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artists compensation and Actors Equity salary</li>
<li>Design budgets for Scenic, Lighting, Costumes and Properties</li>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we are focused on small, reasonable donations of $10, $20 or $50 to fund our production.  For every new donor to <i>Playhouse Creatures</i> CoHo Productions will MATCH your contribution!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Playhouse Creatures </i> exposes what it costs to be an actress.  </p>
<p>In 1669, these pioneering women - our characters - give everything to tread the boards, enduring poverty, prostitution, pregnancy and abortion, violence, dismissal, loneliness and social ostracism under constant pressure to produce new and titillating entertainment.  Their successes in the form of leading roles, trysts with the King and eventually shares in the company could - and do - disappear at any time.  The central theme of the show lies in this tenuous balance.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Betterton muses, ""sometimes I wonder what would happen to a person if it was taken away. That thing one gives one's life blood for."" In <i>Playhouse Creatures</i>, we experience the success... And the taking away.</p>
</div><div>

<h3>Learn More About Brenan and McKenna</h3>
<p>Brenan Dwyer: ""I am an actor, writer, director and producer of stage and screen projects. A Portland native, I’ve worked in numerous houses around town; I was an acting company member at Northwest Classical Theatre Company, and have worked at Oregon Children’s Theatre, Artist Repertory Theatre, Imago Theatre, Lakewood Theatre, Action/Adventure Theatre, Willamette Shakespeare, and at CoHo in Enjoy. </p>
<p>With particular passion for work by and for women, I am a doer who can bring a production from conception to completion. As the creator of my web series Potty Talk, I delivered three seasons of web-based sketch comedy from a grassroots foundation. I completed three crowd funding campaigns, received grant funding from the Regional Arts and Culture Council, organized events, planned premieres, and managed schedules and budgets. I also wrote, directed, and produced a show for Action/Adventure Theatre’s Pilot Season that over-sold every night, and was voted by the audience to return in 2016 for a full run. These projects exemplify that I work tirelessly to achieve success on ventures close to my heart. </p>
<p>Producing is especially interesting to me as I strive to curate a career full of meaningful projects. <i>Playhouse Creatures</i> is particularly exciting to me as an allegory for my experiences as a young woman in Portland theater. I am excited to be in this play because Mrs. Marshall is an assertive firecracker, like me. I am overjoyed to produce it so that we may hold a mirror up to the culture in Portland.""</p>
<p>McKenna Twedt: ""I am an actor and costume designer working in Portland and the surrounding areas. A graduate of Western Oregon University with my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting and Costume Design I take pleasure in my working and academic passion. Having worked with several local companies such as Theatre Vertigo, PHAME Academy, defunkt, Post5 Theatre, Third Rail Repertory, Tears of Joy, Lakewood Theatre, Willamette Shakespeare Company, CoHo Productions and Northwest Classical Theatre Company I consider myself a person of experience in the community and strive to further add my voice to the local conversation. </p>
<p>As a former Third Rail Mentee, I am well acquainted with the particulars of producing a play from inception to completion. As part of the Mentee team I delivered costumes conception and co-execution, co-hosted a fundraising soiree, co-designed and acquired props, conceptualized marketing media photographs, designed marketing flyers and designed the poster, as well as consulted in all areas of the production. As a former educator with Tears of Joy Theatre and Tigard High School Theatre Department, I am experienced in interpreting plays and leading immersive discussion exercises that expand students understanding and appreciation of the material. </p>
<p>I feel that, as an artist, it is my responsibility to support and produce works that speak the transformative language of artistic integrity and ignite the emotional imagination of the viewer. <i>Playhouse Creatures</i> is such a work. The play is a seductive, visceral and charming account of loud, feminine voices I often see suppressed or quieted in historical fiction and popular entertainment.<i> Playhouse Creatures</i> also illuminates the particular practice of being an actress. As an actress myself, I feel the play provides an insight into my world and parallels the experiences of actresses past and present. I am excited and invigorated to produce a play that so honestly captures a true and indiscriminate female experience.""</p>

</div></div>","An all-female cast, crew and co-production team present this play by April De Angelis, uncovering how women struggle to be and not to be represented on the stage, as well as how they work, endure and thrive behind the scenes. 
2016 has been called “the year of women in theatre” – with movements to advance equity in theatre production, casting, staffing, pay and opportunity. Yet for today’s female artists, making a living can be a constant hustle between freelancing, teaching, day-jobbing, seeking child-care or relying on others for financial stability in the creative pursuit of “this thing one gives one’s life blood for.”
Your fiscal sponsorship of Playhouse Creatures will help ensure the longevity of our female artists as well as contribute to the operating needs of our production.
Join CoHo Productions, along with Brenan Dwyer and McKenna Twedt, in creating this uniquely feminine theatrical experience that celebrates the everlasting tenacity of women artists.

We Need You!
Your contribution to Playhouse Creatures will ensure support for:

Artists compensation and Actors Equity salary
Design budgets for Scenic, Lighting, Costumes and Properties
Rehearsal space
Marketing

Additionally, we are focused on small, reasonable donations of $10, $20 or $50 to fund our production.  For every new donor to Playhouse Creatures CoHo Productions will MATCH your contribution!

The Impact
Playhouse Creatures  exposes what it costs to be an actress.  
In 1669, these pioneering women - our characters - give everything to tread the boards, enduring poverty, prostitution, pregnancy and abortion, violence, dismissal, loneliness and social ostracism under constant pressure to produce new and titillating entertainment.  Their successes in the form of leading roles, trysts with the King and eventually shares in the company could - and do - disappear at any time.  The central theme of the show lies in this tenuous balance.
As Mrs. Betterton muses, ""sometimes I wonder what would happen to a person if it was taken away. That thing one gives one's life blood for."" In Playhouse Creatures, we experience the success... And the taking away.

Learn More About Brenan and McKenna
Brenan Dwyer: ""I am an actor, writer, director and producer of stage and screen projects. A Portland native, I’ve worked in numerous houses around town; I was an acting company member at Northwest Classical Theatre Company, and have worked at Oregon Children’s Theatre, Artist Repertory Theatre, Imago Theatre, Lakewood Theatre, Action/Adventure Theatre, Willamette Shakespeare, and at CoHo in Enjoy. 
With particular passion for work by and for women, I am a doer who can bring a production from conception to completion. As the creator of my web series Potty Talk, I delivered three seasons of web-based sketch comedy from a grassroots foundation. I completed three crowd funding campaigns, received grant funding from the Regional Arts and Culture Council, organized events, planned premieres, and managed schedules and budgets. I also wrote, directed, and produced a show for Action/Adventure Theatre’s Pilot Season that over-sold every night, and was voted by the audience to return in 2016 for a full run. These projects exemplify that I work tirelessly to achieve success on ventures close to my heart. 
Producing is especially interesting to me as I strive to curate a career full of meaningful projects. Playhouse Creatures is particularly exciting to me as an allegory for my experiences as a young woman in Portland theater. I am excited to be in this play because Mrs. Marshall is an assertive firecracker, like me. I am overjoyed to produce it so that we may hold a mirror up to the culture in Portland.""
McKenna Twedt: ""I am an actor and costume designer working in Portland and the surrounding areas. A graduate of Western Oregon University with my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting and Costume Design I take pleasure in my working and academic passion. Having worked with several local companies such as Theatre Vertigo, PHAME Academy, defunkt, Post5 Theatre, Third Rail Repertory, Tears of Joy, Lakewood Theatre, Willamette Shakespeare Company, CoHo Productions and Northwest Classical Theatre Company I consider myself a person of experience in the community and strive to further add my voice to the local conversation. 
As a former Third Rail Mentee, I am well acquainted with the particulars of producing a play from inception to completion. As part of the Mentee team I delivered costumes conception and co-execution, co-hosted a fundraising soiree, co-designed and acquired props, conceptualized marketing media photographs, designed marketing flyers and designed the poster, as well as consulted in all areas of the production. As a former educator with Tears of Joy Theatre and Tigard High School Theatre Department, I am experienced in interpreting plays and leading immersive discussion exercises that expand students understanding and appreciation of the material. 
I feel that, as an artist, it is my responsibility to support and produce works that speak the transformative language of artistic integrity and ignite the emotional imagination of the viewer. Playhouse Creatures is such a work. The play is a seductive, visceral and charming account of loud, feminine voices I often see suppressed or quieted in historical fiction and popular entertainment. Playhouse Creatures also illuminates the particular practice of being an actress. As an actress myself, I feel the play provides an insight into my world and parallels the experiences of actresses past and present. I am excited and invigorated to produce a play that so honestly captures a true and indiscriminate female experience.""

<h3>About Curtain Call Youth Theatre</h3>
<p>CCYT is an award-winning teen theatre group based in Agoura Hills, CA. We've dedicated over a decade to theatre arts education. CCYT strives to foster well-rounded performers well-versed in theatre etiquette, discipline, teamwork, and camaraderie in addition to the acting, singing and dancing aspects of live theatrical performance. We are challenging our students with chair choreography and for that, we need chairs!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>View the chair on our wishlist <a href=""http://www.modaseating.com/Bentwood-Sweetheart-Side-Chair_p1025-LHSW.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. Our fundraising goal is enough for 10 chairs plus tax/shipping. Our goal is to raise this money with enough time to rehearse with them.</p>
<p>In return, you'll get a unique peek into our rehearsal process and constant gratitude for your support! After the show, these chairs will belong to our home theatre, Playhouse 101, and we will make them available for future Playhouse 101 productions and rental to fellow members of our arts community.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll buy as many chairs as we can! If we do not reach enough to buy a chair, it will go into the general props/costumes/makeup production budget for the show.</p>
<h3>About the Show</h3>
<p>CCYT’s production of the Tony Award-winning musical, based on Christopher Isherwood’s Berlin Stories with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb and book by Joe Masteroff, is directed by Jeff Wallach. The show takes audiences to 1929 Berlin, Germany, and tells a fun, rigorous story about human nature during political turmoil.</p>
<p>The show itself features the weaving narratives of a cabaret singer, a writer from America, and the inhabitants of Berlin, led by the enigmatic and dazzling Kit Kat Klub Emcee. CCYT’s production brings immersive theatre to the Agoura Hills arts community by transforming Playhouse 101’s black box theatre into the seedy nightclub where the musical is set. The show will be presented in-the-round and feature tables where audience members get a one-of-a-kind experience of memorable songs such as “Cabaret,” “Don’t Tell Mama” and “Maybe This Time” as part of the nightclub’s crowd.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're seeking backers to support our first full production as a theatre company at VAULT Festival 2019. View From Here Theatre amplifies voices underrepresented in UK theatre and shares untold stories from across the country in response to current issues. We're proud to be partnering with Alice Malseed to bring her brilliant play Jade City from a boxing club in Belfast to one of the biggest arts festivals in London. </p>
<p>Jade City gives us a snapshot of Sas and Monty, unemployed and in need of an escape. Through an imaginative game they've played since childhood, they search for the words to talk about a violent act from their past.</p>
<p>The play is a powerful piece of new writing, performed with inventive physical movement from David Quinn and a live electronic score from Michael Mormercha. It explores austerity and masculinity, where disenfranchised young men search for identity; by speaking to the economic realities, it will illuminate Northern Ireland for a London audience, many of whom will be wrestling with an understanding of the social and political situation in the context of Brexit. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help us to bring this production to London and assist us in making theatre more accessible for first-time theatre goers through workshops and discussions. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise £3,000 to make Jade City happen. We are funding a new set and lighting design to prepare the show for VAULT Festival and further UK and Ireland touring. You are also investing in the future of Jade City and without your help we simply won't be able to make the project happen. With a great set and lighting design, we can tour the show and workshops to different spaces, especially to those who have never been to the theatre before.</p>
<p>From a social media shoutout, to a pin badge, to a VIP drinks reception with the cast, writer and director, there's a perk for every budget. We'd love if you can help us in whatever way you can to make this production the best it can be and secure its future. Funding for the arts in Northern Ireland (and across the UK) has become incredibly low and we can no longer rely on these sources to continue to support us.<br/>If you are receiving a social media shoutout, please email your ""@"" to viewfromherefest [at] gmail [dot] com</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We think it's important to tell stories about where you're from, and we need to hear different voices. We think it's important to share those stories across the regions of the UK and exchange ideas. </p>
<p>We want this play to be seen by an audience in London. But we also want that to happen for more than one week. We will invite independent producers, programmers and venues in the hope of forging new creative connections for this play and the company across the UK. Our aim is to take this play from Belfast to London and then onwards around the UK. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have made funding applications to Arts Council England, Culture Ireland and other smaller trusts to support the second iteration of this production. It was fantastic that the initial development of Jade City was funded by a Jerwood Performing Arts Microbursary, and the original Belfast production was supported by the Irish government's Department of Foreign Affairs. We want to keep building on these successes. However, the nature of this kind of event and programming in London, and a serious lack of funding in Northern Ireland,  means we haven't had a huge amount of time to turn that around.</p>
<p>We'd love to guarantee the artists involved a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to cover the cost of transport and accommodation in London</li>
<li>A theatre show worthy of the audience and industry we invite to see it. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also want to give our audiences: </p>
<ul>
<li>an experience that they won't forget </li>
<li>workshops that engage first-time theatre-goers. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the hashtags #jadecity #viewfromhere to help spread the word, follow us on Twitter (@viewfromhere__) and Instagram (@view.from.here__)</li>

Our aim is to take this play from Belfast to London and then onwards around the UK. 

Risks & Challenges
We have made funding applications to Arts Council England, Culture Ireland and other smaller trusts to support the second iteration of this production. It was fantastic that the initial development of Jade City was funded by a Jerwood Performing Arts Microbursary, and the original Belfast production was supported by the Irish government's Department of Foreign Affairs. We want to keep building on these successes. However, the nature of this kind of event and programming in London, and a serious lack of funding in Northern Ireland,  means we haven't had a huge amount of time to turn that around.
We'd love to guarantee the artists involved a few things:

Being able to cover the cost of transport and accommodation in London
A theatre show worthy of the audience and industry we invite to see it. 

We also want to give our audiences: 

an experience that they won't forget 
workshops that engage first-time theatre-goers.

<p>My name is Dylan Crossman.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in France, studied dance at The Laban Center in London and moved to New York 11 years ago. I had the honor of working with Merce Cunningham as an understudy for the last 2 years of his life and then joined the <i>Merce Cunningham Dance Company</i> for its farewell tour. Since then, I have been teaching Merce’s technique, making my own work and freelancing as a dancer. Deeply influenced by Merce Cunningham's work and his curiosity for movement and its inherent drama, I created <i>Dylan Crossman Dans(c)e</i> in 2013 and started making work to express my own artistic voice. </p>
<p>I am fascinated with human behavior and the different ways people interact depending on their culture. Specifically when it comes to intimacy and how it is portrayed generally on stage and more specifically in dance.  </p>
<p>Here We Are, my first evening-length work, is inspired by Milan Kundera's <i>Unbearable Lightness of being </i>; by the different ways we express intimacy and by human behavior and its representation in formalism. I read Milan Kundera's novel in college and I applauded the honesty and the lack of judgement with which he depicted his characters. It echoes what I am trying to convey as an artist. How do I create a work featuring honest performances, story-telling, virtuosic dancing and an openness on stage, as if you were just listening to a friend tell you her/his story? </p>
<p>I have received an emerging artist grant from the <i>Jerome Foundation </i>which comes with a fully produced show at Abrons Arts Center, 400 hours of free rehearsal space and a $5000 stipend. That is and has been invaluable. However, in order to pay all my wonderful collaborators, I need your help. My crew, for this show, is composed of 5 wonderful dancers, an extremely talented lighting designer, a visionary electronic composer and an incredible scenographer/ dramaturg. They have all given me time, commitment and trust and it is extremely important to me to pay them what they deserve. Today, when the arts are under attack, I cannot compromise on that.</p>
<p>The piece will be performed in the Playhouse at Abrons Arts Center, June 28-30th. Jesse Stiles will dressing the space with his electronic score, live, while my dancers- Jason Collins, Una Ludviksen, Sherah Shipman and Brandon Washington- and I take you on a journey, tell you about love, betrayal and doubt in the space carefully designed by Hubert Lafore.</p>

<p><b>Help me fine tune my acting skills!</b></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Nicholas, and I’m an aspiring actor in Washington, DC who’s been granted an amazing opportunity to further my skills and career. I’ve gained admittance to the Theatre Lab’s Honors Conservatory, and I need your money. lol. The full tuition is nearly $6,000, which is a lot of money—especially for someone living in DC. After rent and my student loan payment, I’m short $6,000! So, how about it? Will you help me make this dream—my lifelong dream, no less!—a reality?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447905302/ujf1e9jnwourmc3w0jvv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>My rationale for completing this conservatory—or at least, the one I gave them! :) </b></p>
<p>Recently, I became a part of a theatrical performance that changed me forever. I had the honor of playing Dickon in the Theatre Lab’s version of <i>The Secret Garden</i>. And I must say it wasn’t easy. For some unknown reason, I wasn't able to give 100% of myself to the role. In my mind, I felt I didn’t harness my talent, drive and confidence to fully create a performance that was inspirational—a performance that was truly successful. After each performance, I walked away thinking there was so much more I could do whether it be hold a note longer, stretch my arms further or speak a phrase slower. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It had been a long time since I’d been on stage. As a child, I was singing and dancing all over Nashville, Tennessee. I was good—really good. At one point, a theater director invited a few New York talent scouts to my performance of a Country Christmas, where I played Tex, an ornery oil tycoon that discovered the true meaning of Christmas. The scouts loved it. They even offered me a chance to come to New York and audition for plays there. My mother, on the other hand, wasn’t too happy about an eighth grader moving to New York, especially coming from a small country town south of Nashville. And I wasn’t happy about my mother’s decision. I was livid. I wasn’t able to pursue a dream of mine—performing on the broadway stage and winning a Tony. From that point on, I stopped acting entirely. (See, I’ve been dramatic all my life.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>I reemerged on the theatrical scene with a nudge from a friend in DC. My friend Mary suggested we start doing improv together. She’d researched the idea and determined that the Washington Improv theater’s improvisation classes were a good place to start. The classes taught me how to perfect my physical performance, think quickly on my feet, and listen to others. Most importantly, my year of improvisation classes brought back the familiar sensation of being on stage—a feeling I wanted more of. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose the theater lab for more training. The first class I took was Singing Sondheim. I was extremely nervous. First, I couldn’t read music. Second, I didn’t know anything about Stephen Sondheim. As a matter of fact, I didn’t even know he was still alive. However, my nerves calmed, and I learned a great deal about theatrical lyric interpretation and phrasing. In my opinion, I thrived against a steep learning curve. The class taught me a great deal and became the connection I needed to secure my first role in DC, as Dickon. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Few conservatory programs in the DMV have reputations as eminent and connections as widespread as the Theatre Lab’s Honors Conservatory.

<h3>What this play is about</h3>
<p>Based on the real stories of gamers, The Video Game Monologues shares first times, legendary battles, and the lives changed by pressing “Start.” Part ethnography and part fantasy, this episodic play stages the adventures of hardcore and casual gamers alike, punctuated by cameos of notorious and beloved game characters. From arcade to console, The Video Game Monologues reminds us to learn from our fatalities and cherish our 1Ups.</p>
<h3>TL;DR Version</h3>
<p>10 short stories about epic video game experiences, performed by actors playing multiple characters. </p>
<h3><strong>Why theater about video games matters</strong></h3>
<p>We are producing this because memories made around video games are as significant for our identities as music, books, or any other experiential medium. As misplaced proof of their influence, video games often become cultural scapegoats, but performing these stories amplifies the power of games and how they can change our lives. Please consider contributing to this campaign if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>believe that art and technology make great bedfellows</li>
<li>value video games as important cultural barometers</li>
<li>support theater as an accessible expression of cultural experience </li>
<li>value events that bridge demographic divides</li>
<li>enjoy pop culture, live storytelling, or fun spectacle</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","What this play is about
Based on the real stories of gamers, The Video Game Monologues shares first times, legendary battles, and the lives changed by pressing “Start.” Part ethnography and part fantasy, this episodic play stages the adventures of hardcore and casual gamers alike, punctuated by cameos of notorious and beloved game characters. From arcade to console, The Video Game Monologues reminds us to learn from our fatalities and cherish our 1Ups.
TL;DR Version
10 short stories about epic video game experiences, performed by actors playing multiple characters. 
Why theater about video games matters
We are producing this because memories made around video games are as significant for our identities as music, books, or any other experiential medium. As misplaced proof of their influence, video games often become cultural scapegoats, but performing these stories amplifies the power of games and how they can change our lives. Please consider contributing to this campaign if you:

believe that art and technology make great bedfellows
value video games as important cultural barometers
support theater as an accessible expression of cultural experience 
value events that bridge demographic divides
enjoy pop culture, live storytelling, or fun spectacle

The One Behind the Curtain
Lian Amaris (writer, director, producer) has been staging original genre-bending performance for ten years. She's taught theater, new media, game culture, and creative writing at the college level; she's researched and published on video games; and she's even earned some great press from Backstage, The New York Times, and even Forbes. Vector Art Ensemble is her company of rakish comedians, repertory-trained actors, verbose dancers, and other rogue entertainers dedicated to ""exploring performance trajectories.""

<p><strong>We are:</strong> A collective of International Artists developing a visually provocative theatre work that merges linguistic and cultural borders.  Drawing on our personal, cultural and linguistic histories we will together discover the universal tale surrounding the themes of love, desire and beauty based on the new play, <em>Bird Song</em>, by Ren Flannery.  This is the debut of <em>Bird Song</em> and through a two and half month creative exchange taking place in Taipei we will draw on our diverse artistic practices to create a work that communicates to a global audience and transcends cultural, linguistic and social divide.  Without your help <em>Bird Song</em> may never see the light of day and the boundaries of theatrical story telling may never be explored!!  Help us fly....</p>

<p>Qui sommes-nous ?<br/>Nous sommes un collectif d’artistes internationaux qui travaillons au développement<br/>d’un théâtre visuellement provocateur combinant différents horizons linguistiques et<br/>culturels. Puisant dans les récits de nos cultures respectives, nous nous lançons à la<br/>découverte d’un conte universel bâti autour des thèmes de l’amour, du désir et de la<br/>beauté, basé sur la nouvelle pièce de Ren Flannery, Bird Song. Nous nous sommes<br/>posé à Taipei (Taiwan) où, pendant deux mois et demi de gestation et d’échanges<br/>artistiques, nous allons élaborer une œuvre qui a pour vocation de dépasser les<br/>clivages culturels, linguistiques et sociaux, et de s’adresser au monde entier.</p>
<p><strong></strong><br/><strong>What we need:</strong> We desperately need a Taiwanese local with profecient English skills to act as a full time production manager/translator/administrator.  They will be the much-needed oil in the machine, bridging all language and cultural confusion that comes with working on foreign soil.  As this is a rare independant project working across different cultures we face many complexities most theatre shows wouldn't and we depseratley need a savvy local to help us achieve vital communications with the Taiwanese Government, immigration, the Theatre, the ticketing system, the insurance company, the local sponsors, various marketing platforms and the Taipei community. </p>
<p>As this position will be the key to our success we need to ensure the appointed person has the ability to dedicate all of their time to this project, as it is quite a demanding role.  Living expenses are high in Taipei but wages are low so that most unmarried people have to live at home with their parents their entire lives.  The money raised here will pay the wage of this person allowing them to fullfill the role accordingly.  It will also cover the flights and accommodation of our overseas artists and the translation of the script and other important documents.</p>
<p>The entire budget of the project is roughly $50,000USD; with $10,000USD confirmed we can adequately begin this journey.  By supporting our project you will be actively participating in the beginning of an innovative exploration into communication across racial divide through the celebration of Art and humanity.  With your contribution you will be joining our ecclectic team in creating a visually provacative, visceral and profound new theatre work that will touch audiences world wide. </p>

<p>De quoi avons-nous besoin ?<br/>Mon nom est Ren Flannery. Je suis une artiste indépendante et je suis arrivée à Taipei avec une<br/>connaissance basique du chinois mandarin et une valise pleine à craquée de grandes<br/>idées. J’ai reçu jusqu’à présent un soutien et des retours extraordinaires. Aussi, après<br/>quatre mois de dur labeur et un nombre incalculable de discussions, le projet est en<br/>bel et bien en marche ! Je porte aujourd’hui entre autres les différentes casquettes<br/>d’écrivain, metteuse en scène, productrice, administratrice et chargée de promotion.<br/>Dans un tel contexte, et alors que le financement de la production me paraît extrêment<br/>prometteur, ce dont nous avons vraiment besoin maintenant, c’est de pouvoir<br/>employer à plein temps une personne locale et de lui confier les missions de directeur/<br/>directrice de production, de traducteur/traductrice-interpête et d’administrateur/<br/>administratrice. Vu le caractère extrêmement chronophage des difficultés rencontrées<br/>jusqu’ici dans l’avancement des questions de logistique du spectacle, il va sans dire<br/>que cette personne jouera un rôle d’une importance capitale dans la suite du projet.<br/>Il s’agira pour elle de me servir d’intermédiaire auprès du Gouvernement Taiwanais,<br/>du Théâtre, du système de vente de billets en ligne, de la compagnie d’assurance, des<br/>sponsors locaux, des différentes plateformes de marketing et de la communauté de la<br/>ville de Taipei. Ce poste étant la clé de notre réussite, nous devons nous assurer que<br/>la personne qui endosse cette lourde reponsabilité ait la capacité d’y consacrer tout<br/>son temps. L’argent que nous allons récolter ici servira à payer cette personne, les<br/>billets d’avion et le logement de nos artistes étrangers et la traduction du scénario. Le<br/>budget total de la production étant de plus ou moins 50 000 dollars, il est raisonnable<br/>d’estimer qu’avec 10 000 dollars fermes, nous pouvons d’ores et déjà entamer le<br/>voyage en toute sérénité. En apportant votre soutien à notre projet, vous choisissez<br/>de prendre vous aussi activement part au lancement d’une exploration innovante de<br/>la communication et du dialogue interculturels, à travers la célébration de l’art et de<br/>l’humanité !</p>
<p><strong>The Plan: </strong> Bird Song will be developed through a two and half month creative exchange with a team of International Artists in Taipei City, where it will debut at Guling Street Avant-Garde Theatre in mid-September.  Once the production is up the next step is to tour it around the Asia/Pacific first and then Europe and the USA in 2013/2014.  <em>Bird Song</em>has been intentionally developed to tour with the ability to adapt to changing audience and performance environments making it accessible to a broad spectrum of audiences, festivals and programs.</p>

<p>C’est quoi le plan ?<br/>Bird Song sera développée dans la ville de Taipei (Taiwan), pendant deux mois<br/>et demi d’échanges créatifs entre les membres d’une équipe composée d’artistes<br/>internationaux et créée au Théâtre Avant-Garde de la rue Guling, mi-septembre 2012.<br/>Une fois la production sur pied, nous entamerons une tournée en Asie-Pacifique dans<br/>un premier temps, puis en Europe et aux Etats-Unis pour la saison 2013-2014. Bird<br/>Song a été spécialement conçue pour pouvoir faire le tour du monde, et s’adapte<br/>facilement à des publics et à des conditions de représentation variées, ce qui la rend<br/>accessible à un large éventail de publics, de festivals et de programmations.</p>
<p><strong>Bird Song is:</strong><em> </em><em>a</em> fantastical tale that traverses time and explores the universal themes of love, desire and beauty found within the intimate moments of self. Seeking the common voice of the feminine sensuality, <em>Bird Song</em> uses shadow and light, dream and song to narrate the quiet journey of two women and a mythological bird each entrapped in a world that dictates their fate.  <em>Bird Song </em>uses visual and performance mechanisms to explore the core essentials of humanity and the intimate moments that bind us as a singular race.</p>
<p>Situated in a private bathhouse <strong>Bird Song</strong> follows the journeys of two women from different worlds.  The lives of a Japanese aristocrats daughter from the late Qing dynasty and a well educated maid from the cultural revolution begin to intertwine through their relationship with a beautiful mythological Bird based on Chinese mythological pre-human woman who discovered theatre. Their discovery of love, desire and beauty comes from the most intimate moments with self as they go about their daily rituals.  The intersection of their lives no longer allows them to live within their naive pasts as they discover the most beautiful and tragic realities of their hearts.<em> </em></p>

<p>A propos de Bird Song<br/>Bird Song est un conte fantastique qui traverse plusieurs époques et explore les<br/>thèmes universels de l’amour, du désir et de la beauté, tels qu’on peut les vivre dans<br/>les moments d’intimité avec soi-même. Cherchant la voix de la sensualité féminine,<br/>Bird Song exploite les jeux d’ombres et de lumières, le rêve et la chanson pour<br/>raconter le paisible voyage de deux femmes et d’un oiseau mythologique, tous trois<br/>pris au piège dans un monde qui conditionne leur destinée.

<p>Comment cela a-t-il commencé ?<br/>Constatant l’existence de véritables fossés de communication entre les différentes<br/>communautés culturelles australiennes, Ren Flannery s’est mise en quête des<br/>universaux encore capables de connecter entre eux tous les êtres humains. Il y a trois<br/>ans, perdue dans la contemplation d’un Melbourne gris et froid qu’elle traversait en<br/>train, elle eut la vision d’une maison de bain baignée d’une lumière chaude et d’une<br/>cage à oiseau dorée à la fenêtre. C’est cette image qui est à l’origine de l’écriture<br/>de sa nouvelle œuvre Bird Song, qui explore de l’intérieur les notions d’amour, de<br/>désir et de beauté plutôt que de s’interroger sur la nature de ces concepts. Bird Song<br/>a été écrite avec le projet de montrer cette pièce au monde entier et de toucher un<br/>public plus large que celui qui se rend généralement au théâtre. Envisagé comme<br/>un processus de développement collaboratif, Bird Song se veut un laboratoire où<br/>explorer l’art de la narration théâtrale, et ce, dans une perspective universelle visant<br/>à connecter liguistiquement et culturellement différents publics réunis autour d’une<br/>expérience commune.</p>

We are: A collective of International Artists developing a visually provocative theatre work that merges linguistic and cultural borders.  Drawing on our personal, cultural and linguistic histories we will together discover the universal tale surrounding the themes of love, desire and beauty based on the new play, Bird Song, by Ren Flannery.  This is the debut of Bird Song and through a two and half month creative exchange taking place in Taipei we will draw on our diverse artistic practices to create a work that communicates to a global audience and transcends cultural, linguistic and social divide.  Without your help Bird Song may never see the light of day and the boundaries of theatrical story telling may never be explored!!  Help us fly....

Qui sommes-nous ?Nous sommes un collectif d’artistes internationaux qui travaillons au développementd’un théâtre visuellement provocateur combinant différents horizons linguistiques etculturels. Puisant dans les récits de nos cultures respectives, nous nous lançons à ladécouverte d’un conte universel bâti autour des thèmes de l’amour, du désir et de labeauté, basé sur la nouvelle pièce de Ren Flannery, Bird Song. Nous nous sommesposé à Taipei (Taiwan) où, pendant deux mois et demi de gestation et d’échangesartistiques, nous allons élaborer une œuvre qui a pour vocation de dépasser lesclivages culturels, linguistiques et sociaux, et de s’adresser au monde entier.
What we need: We desperately need a Taiwanese local with profecient English skills to act as a full time production manager/translator/administrator.  They will be the much-needed oil in the machine, bridging all language and cultural confusion that comes with working on foreign soil.  As this is a rare independant project working across different cultures we face many complexities most theatre shows wouldn't and we depseratley need a savvy local to help us achieve vital communications with the Taiwanese Government, immigration, the Theatre, the ticketing system, the insurance company, the local sponsors, various marketing platforms and the Taipei community. 
As this position will be the key to our success we need to ensure the appointed person has the ability to dedicate all of their time to this project, as it is quite a demanding role.  Living expenses are high in Taipei but wages are low so that most unmarried people have to live at home with their parents their entire lives.  The money raised here will pay the wage of this person allowing them to fullfill the role accordingly.  It will also cover the flights and accommodation of our overseas artists and the translation of the script and other important documents.
The entire budget of the project is roughly $50,000USD; with $10,000USD confirmed we can adequately begin this journey.  By supporting our project you will be actively participating in the beginning of an innovative exploration into communication across racial divide through the celebration of Art and humanity.  With your contribution you will be joining our ecclectic team in creating a visually provacative, visceral and profound new theatre work that will touch audiences world wide.

De quoi avons-nous besoin ?Mon nom est Ren Flannery. Je suis une artiste indépendante et je suis arrivée à Taipei avec uneconnaissance basique du chinois mandarin et une valise pleine à craquée de grandesidées. J’ai reçu jusqu’à présent un soutien et des retours extraordinaires. Aussi, aprèsquatre mois de dur labeur et un nombre incalculable de discussions, le projet est enbel et bien en marche ! Je porte aujourd’hui entre autres les différentes casquettesd’écrivain, metteuse en scène, productrice, administratrice et chargée de promotion.Dans un tel contexte, et alors que le financement de la production me paraît extrêmentprometteur, ce dont nous avons vraiment besoin maintenant, c’est de pouvoiremployer à plein temps une personne locale et de lui confier les missions de directeur/directrice de production, de traducteur/traductrice-interpête et d’administrateur/administratrice. Vu le caractère extrêmement chronophage des difficultés rencontréesjusqu’ici dans l’avancement des questions de logistique du spectacle, il va sans direque cette personne jouera un rôle d’une importance capitale dans la suite du projet.Il s’agira pour elle de me servir d’intermédiaire auprès du Gouvernement Taiwanais,du Théâtre, du système de vente de billets en ligne, de la compagnie d’assurance, dessponsors locaux, des différentes plateformes de marketing et de la communauté de laville de Taipei. Ce poste étant la clé de notre réussite, nous devons nous assurer quela personne qui endosse cette lourde reponsabilité ait la capacité d’y consacrer toutson temps. L’argent que nous allons récolter ici servira à payer cette personne, lesbillets d’avion et le logement de nos artistes étrangers et la traduction du scénario. Lebudget total de la production étant de plus ou moins 50 000 dollars, il est raisonnabled’estimer qu’avec 10 000 dollars fermes, nous pouvons d’ores et déjà entamer levoyage en toute sérénité. En apportant votre soutien à notre projet, vous choisissezde prendre vous aussi activement part au lancement d’une exploration innovante dela communication et du dialogue interculturels, à travers la célébration de l’art et del’humanité !
The Plan:  Bird Song will be developed through a two and half month creative exchange with a team of International Artists in Taipei City, where it will debut at Guling Street Avant-Garde Theatre in mid-September.  Once the production is up the next step is to tour it around the Asia/Pacific first and then Europe and the USA in 2013/2014.  Bird Songhas been intentionally developed to tour with the ability to adapt to changing audience and performance environments making it accessible to a broad spectrum of audiences, festivals and programs.

C’est quoi le plan ?Bird Song sera développée dans la ville de Taipei (Taiwan), pendant deux moiset demi d’échanges créatifs entre les membres d’une équipe composée d’artistesinternationaux et créée au Théâtre Avant-Garde de la rue Guling, mi-septembre 2012.Une fois la production sur pied, nous entamerons une tournée en Asie-Pacifique dansun premier temps, puis en Europe et aux Etats-Unis pour la saison 2013-2014. BirdSong a été spécialement conçue pour pouvoir faire le tour du monde, et s’adaptefacilement à des publics et à des conditions de représentation variées, ce qui la rendaccessible à un large éventail de publics, de festivals et de programmations.
Bird Song is: a fantastical tale that traverses time and explores the universal themes of love, desire and beauty found within the intimate moments of self. Seeking the common voice of the feminine sensuality, Bird Song uses shadow and light, dream and song to narrate the quiet journey of two women and a mythological bird each entrapped in a world that dictates their fate.  Bird Song uses visual and performance mechanisms to explore the core essentials of humanity and the intimate moments that bind us as a singular race.
Situated in a private bathhouse Bird Song follows the journeys of two women from different worlds.  The lives of a Japanese aristocrats daughter from the late Qing dynasty and a well educated maid from the cultural revolution begin to intertwine through their relationship with a beautiful mythological Bird based on Chinese mythological pre-human woman who discovered theatre. Their discovery of love, desire and beauty comes from the most intimate moments with self as they go about their daily rituals.  The intersection of their lives no longer allows them to live within their naive pasts as they discover the most beautiful and tragic realities of their hearts.

A propos de Bird SongBird Song est un conte fantastique qui traverse plusieurs époques et explore lesthèmes universels de l’amour, du désir et de la beauté, tels qu’on peut les vivre dansles moments d’intimité avec soi-même. Cherchant la voix de la sensualité féminine,Bird Song exploite les jeux d’ombres et de lumières, le rêve et la chanson pourraconter le paisible voyage de deux femmes et d’un oiseau mythologique, tous troispris au piège dans un monde qui conditionne leur destinée. Bird Song utilise le visuelet les mécanismes du jeu d’acteur pour explorer ce noyau essentiel d’humanité, cesmoments d’intimité qui nous relient les uns aux autres en une seule et unique race.
How it began: Witnessing a break down of understanding between various cultural communities in Australia impassioned Ren Flannery to find the points where human beings connect as a singular race.  Three years ago, while riding a train on cold, grey Melbourne day she had a vision of a warmly lit bathhouse with a gilded birdcage by the window.  This image sparked the writing of her new work Bird Song, which explores the notions of love, desire and beauty from an internal source opposed to the external perspective of ‘what is?’  Bird Song was written with the intention of touring it across the globe and reaching audience beyond the typical 'theatre going' demographic.  By using a collaborative development process Bird Song will act as a platform for exploring theatrical story telling to a universal audience, connecting a linguistically and culturally diverse audience in a shared experience.

Comment cela a-t-il commencé ?Constatant l’existence de véritables fossés de communication entre les différentescommunautés culturelles australiennes, Ren Flannery s’est mise en quête desuniversaux encore capables de connecter entre eux tous les êtres humains. Il y a troisans, perdue dans la contemplation d’un Melbourne gris et froid qu’elle traversait entrain, elle eut la vision d’une maison de bain baignée d’une lumière chaude et d’unecage à oiseau dorée à la fenêtre. C’est cette image qui est à l’origine de l’écriturede sa nouvelle œuvre Bird Song, qui explore de l’intérieur les notions d’amour, dedésir et de beauté plutôt que de s’interroger sur la nature de ces concepts. Bird Songa été écrite avec le projet de montrer cette pièce au monde entier et de toucher unpublic plus large que celui qui se rend généralement au théâtre. Envisagé commeun processus de développement collaboratif, Bird Song se veut un laboratoire oùexplorer l’art de la narration théâtrale, et ce, dans une perspective universelle visantà connecter liguistiquement et culturellement différents publics réunis autour d’uneexpérience commune.

<p>sExtOrtiOn is a fictional account of actual events regarding a teen sexting scandal that shook a community and made national news. The term sExtOrtiOn was coined by the media for the particular combination of teen texting/sexting and subsequent extortion. Our story deals with a boy who poses as a girl on a social media site to get others to send him compromising photos &amp; videos, and ""sextorts"" them into upping the ante with each contact with the threat of exposure.  This ""sextortion"" took place for over a year before anyone outside the boy's circle knew of it, and the subsequent exposure of the situation had everyone wondering how it could have ever taken place.</p>
<p>In sExtOrtiOn, 6 boys, 2 girls &amp; 1 adult, take the audience on a harrowing cyber ride into the world of teen sexting.  Comedy &amp; drama cover the bases of... sexual identity, texting/sexting, bullying, pack behaviors, teen recklessness, adult/child relationships and coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>""We all cope in different ways"", says one character, and I cope by putting the story into the mouths of 9 actors to tell the tale.  Help me &amp; those 9 actors &amp; the creative team tell the tale of Donny Doirko sentenced as an adult for what he did as a minor now spending an inordinate number of years incarcerated. </p>

<h2>ARTISTIC STATEMENT </h2>
<h3><em>PLAYWRIGHT/CO-TRANSLATOR &amp; ACTRESS SAMANTHA GRASSIAN:</em></h3>
<p>""I am a firm believer in the fact that instead of torturing their audience with existential questions such as why human beings are on this planet, or why we feel what we feel, playwrights, directors, and actors should focus on making their audiences happy. Theater is a wonderful vehicle for laughter and pain relief, and I believe that people go through enough pain in their lives to be forced to watch more pain when they go to the theater. As artists, it is our duty to make people laugh, to make them happy: because happy people make a better world.""<em><br/></em></p>
<h2>WHAT'S THE STORY?</h2>
<p>The play “The Goldfish” is a dark comedy, which was originally written in French, with the title “Le Poisson Rouge”. “The Goldfish” will be performed in both French and English, depending on the evening you attend; thus allowing the audience to pick and choose in which language they would prefer to see it. The play also mixes three artistic disciplines: theater, mime and dance. This situation comedy in which two completely clueless blondes deal with a dead body on stage makes this work an inventive, comical, and an out of the ordinary piece.</p>
<h3><em>Therefore, take two blondes, a dead man walking and dancing, a goldfish found ‘belly up’, and you will end up with a recipe for disaster.</em></h3>

<p><strong>Please if you can donate as little as £1 or $1 this makes us 1 step closer to our goal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Little bit about us. </strong></p>
<p>Royston Amateur Performing Arts Group (RAPAG) is a non-profit group run by volunteers to get children and adults from low socioeconomic backgrounds to enjoy and embrace theatre and at the same time providing the community with affordable theatre that all can participate in or enjoy watching. We do 2 shows a year, a summer show and then a December show, and the children love it.</p>

<p>Hey Hey!</p>
<p>First of all, thanks for checking this out! It takes passion, determination, inspiration, and lots of money, to create amazing theatre. We have three of these in abundance… can you help us with the fourth?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a new company called Beside the Salt Productions and here is some information about our mandate and us:</p>
<p>Beside the Salt Productions is an Edmonton based company geared towards generating the presentation of theatre, dance and multimedia. Beside the Salt is committed to bringing together both experienced and emerging artists to work together and share a wealth of traditions, skills, ideas and inspirations. Beside the Salt chooses to explore varied artistic approaches, alternative spaces and styles that challenge the boundaries between artists and audiences.</p>
<p>Beside the Salt chooses to endeavor an approach to the pieces that we bring to the community by incorporating a variety of cultural, historical, and stylistic elements to our work. Taking inspiration from traditions, dances, and lifestyles of different regions, along with incorporating technology that assists in the production of a piece. Beside the Salt also tries to find unique and appropriate places to house our presentations. From current theatre spaces, to warehouses, or lounges our goal is to locate venues that are not only suitable from an artistic standpoint but that are also applicable to the pieces we are producing.</p>
<p>With a strong focus on the significance of text and movement, Beside the Salt highlights the importance of further developing an artist’s tools. As speakers, singers, dancers and movers Beside the Salt aims to allow the artists we work with to develop a more acute grasp of their own style and creative process while still maintaining the momentum of the group and its current projects.</p>
<p>Beside the Salt Productions takes precaution that what it produces will reach as broad an audience as possible; while at the same time, takes great care to ensure we maintain a strong, relevant, attentive, responsive and sensitive stance in our company’s work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>This summer Beside the Salt is producing a BRAND NEW WORK called “<em>dust.</em>” at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival. We have been so lucky thus far and some incredible people have helped us out a long the way. We just need a little more help to take us all the way. Your donation will help us with things like: photography, handbills, posters and programs. As well as exciting things like a set and an ORIGINAL SCORE to accompany the show!!</p>
<p>Aside from the perks you see to the right, everyone who donates to this campaign will receive a special thank-you in our show program.
