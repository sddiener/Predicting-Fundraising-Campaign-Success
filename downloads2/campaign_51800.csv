<h3>Our Film</h3>
<p></p>
<i>Animus</i> is a psychological thriller based around Carl Gustav Jung’s theory of collective unconscious. The story starts with Jane, a professional woman who finds her life falling apart when she keeps her newfound pregnancy a secret. Through a surreal twist, Jane steps into her past wounds to reconcile her estranged complexes.<p></p>
<div>
<h3>Our Passion</h3>This film explores a viewpoint that Carl Gustav Jung spent limited time writing about: the female perspective. CG Jung and his wife, Emma, have made great claims that, mentally, women are mirror opposites of men, therefore unequal to the latter. Many of the conclusions the Jungs came to about women psyche were based on mens works. This is an unfair representation of a woman’s mind and I was propelled to use my own creative outlet to showcase an atypical female protagonist through the lens of this theory.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<h3>Our Audience</h3>Animus appeals to anyone interested in investigating the human mind. You do not have to be familiar with Jung to enjoy Jane’s story; this is a raw exploration of a woman’s perspective. Although Jungian fans will be rewarded: the psyche is explored through Jungian symbolism and archetypes. All movie-lovers welcome.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<div>
<p>So much talent and passion has already gone into Animus, yet we need money if we are going to bring it to life. This story needs $5,000 to achieve the visual aesthetic it deserves. Your support will be going to:</p>
<p>-Locations</p>
<p>-Craft Servies for Cast/Crew</p>
<p>-Transportation</p>
<p>-Detailed Art/Costume Department</p>
<p>-Special Effects Make-Up</p>
<p>-Post Production</p>
<br/><p>All camera and lighting equipment generously provided by Columbia College Chicago.</p>
<p>Our perks include original posters, t-shirts, paintings and sculptures, all tied into Carl Jung's theories- including the perks named after his archetypal theory! </p>If we exceed our $5,000 goal, all additional proceeds will go to festival fees.</div>

Animus is a psychological thriller based around Carl Gustav Jung’s theory of collective unconscious. The story starts with Jane, a professional woman who finds her life falling apart when she keeps her newfound pregnancy a secret. Through a surreal twist, Jane steps into her past wounds to reconcile her estranged complexes.

Our PassionThis film explores a viewpoint that Carl Gustav Jung spent limited time writing about: the female perspective. CG Jung and his wife, Emma, have made great claims that, mentally, women are mirror opposites of men, therefore unequal to the latter. Many of the conclusions the Jungs came to about women psyche were based on mens works. This is an unfair representation of a woman’s mind and I was propelled to use my own creative outlet to showcase an atypical female protagonist through the lens of this theory.


Our AudienceAnimus appeals to anyone interested in investigating the human mind. You do not have to be familiar with Jung to enjoy Jane’s story; this is a raw exploration of a woman’s perspective. Although Jungian fans will be rewarded: the psyche is explored through Jungian symbolism and archetypes. All movie-lovers welcome.

Our Goal

So much talent and passion has already gone into Animus, yet we need money if we are going to bring it to life. This story needs $5,000 to achieve the visual aesthetic it deserves. Your support will be going to:
-Locations
-Craft Servies for Cast/Crew
-Transportation
-Detailed Art/Costume Department
-Special Effects Make-Up
-Post Production
All camera and lighting equipment generously provided by Columbia College Chicago.
Our perks include original posters, t-shirts, paintings and sculptures, all tied into Carl Jung's theories- including the perks named after his archetypal theory! If we exceed our $5,000 goal, all additional proceeds will go to festival fees.

Assata Terrell - Costume Designer
I am a fashion student at Columbia College Chicago. I am interested in how fashion and personal style collide with the rest of the world. My favorite part about working in film is that I get to create styles and life stories behind the characters. I hope to create and work on projects that combine all my fascinations and connect with others on a personal level.

Josh Gaetz - SFX Make-Up
Throughout my life I have dabbled with almost every known medium of art, including things like traditional painting, pottery, sewing, crochet, weaving, graphic arts, web design, 3d model design, etc. You name it and I've probably done it, and if I haven't, I would like to some day. I've been experimenting with special effects makeup for around 6 years. I have been constantly inspired by artists behind the camera, and always imagined what it would be like to work in film. My goal is to bring as much of my talent and knowledge to this film as I can possibly offer, so you can expect some pretty realistic and awesome looking end results!

Dennis Preston - ArtistWhen I finished high school I set out to the American Academy of Art, where I majored in illustration. Knowing that the art world is tough and very competitive, I decided to widen my expertise and become a jack of all trades, so to speak. But the one thing that I have always loved the most is horror films and special effects, so I decided that make up effects and filming would be my main focus. Now I freelance creating props and special effects makeup work for independent filmmakers in and around the Chicago area.Dennis' website: prestonperspectives.com

</b></h3><b>
</b><p></p><div>
<p><b><i>Long Island Lights</i></b> is a half-hour comedic TV show about a group of misfits who come together to chase after celebrity in hopes of conquering Hollywood. They do so in the age of frenzied social media and viral videos where success seems one click away. They are dead set on making it big <b>BUT</b> they have no idea what they are doing. </p>
<p>It's about family and giving crazy a chance (both often go hand-in-hand).</p>
<p>
The show follows a ‘stuck in the system’ office worker, who after a quarter life crisis, has an embarrassing video (involving his balls) that goes viral and turns him into a reluctant internet star. He then returns to his family home
in Long Island where he joins an amateur production company who believe they
are bound for Hollywood, but in reality couldn’t be further from it. <br/></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.liltvshow.com/video-gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LIL Video Gallery</a><br/></p>
<p>We have an incredible cast and crew that's been working on this project for close to three years now. We have filmed a lot of promotional footage and even filmed about 40% of our pilot episode. But we need IndieGoGo and your help to finish the rest of our Pilot episode!</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Living just below
the shallow surface of social media is a strong undercurrent of relationships
and familial bonds forged through the wild and often crazy schemes cooked up
regularly by these misfits. Although they stumble every step of the way, the
important part is that they are living life, together as friends and family.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On a weekly basis, <i>Long Island Lights</i> messes up the most
routine productions. At one point, a commercial turns into a puppy mill operation
while in the next episode a frustrated Rick creates his own gay film festival
featuring his gay zombie apocalypse movie, ‘EAT’ only to place 8<sup>th</sup>
at his own festival. The crew finds themselves pitching MTV ½ to MTV, an idea
that all popular shows would be reenacted using midgets. </p>
<p>As
the series develops we find that sometimes a little crazy can lead to unexpected
success in the best of ways.</p>

</div> </div>","SHORT SUMMARY


Long Island Lights is a half-hour comedic TV show about a group of misfits who come together to chase after celebrity in hopes of conquering Hollywood. They do so in the age of frenzied social media and viral videos where success seems one click away. They are dead set on making it big BUT they have no idea what they are doing. 
It's about family and giving crazy a chance (both often go hand-in-hand).

The show follows a ‘stuck in the system’ office worker, who after a quarter life crisis, has an embarrassing video (involving his balls) that goes viral and turns him into a reluctant internet star. He then returns to his family home
in Long Island where he joins an amateur production company who believe they
are bound for Hollywood, but in reality couldn’t be further from it.

We have an incredible cast and crew that's been working on this project for close to three years now. We have filmed a lot of promotional footage and even filmed about 40% of our pilot episode. But we need IndieGoGo and your help to finish the rest of our Pilot episode!


Living just below
the shallow surface of social media is a strong undercurrent of relationships
and familial bonds forged through the wild and often crazy schemes cooked up
regularly by these misfits. Although they stumble every step of the way, the
important part is that they are living life, together as friends and family.


On a weekly basis, Long Island Lights messes up the most
routine productions. At one point, a commercial turns into a puppy mill operation
while in the next episode a frustrated Rick creates his own gay film festival
featuring his gay zombie apocalypse movie, ‘EAT’ only to place 8th
at his own festival. The crew finds themselves pitching MTV ½ to MTV, an idea
that all popular shows would be reenacted using midgets. 
As
the series develops we find that sometimes a little crazy can lead to unexpected
success in the best of ways.

Will filmmakers attend?
Yes! Wallabout is not only a film festival, but also a way to network with other creative students, and an opportunity to meet industry professionals at our party! We would love to see you there!
Who will be judging the films at Wallabout?
A panel of industry professionals typically make up Wallabout’s jury – a cross-section of filmmakers, programmers, journalists, academics, and other industry. In addition, attendees get to have their say as well through Wallabout’s Audience Award.   What We Need & What You Get  We have been allotted a very small budget from Pratt Institute to organize the festival and everything associated with it – from the venue rental to the afterparty - but it doesn't cover all of our expenses.

 We're looking to raise at least $1,000 to put towards the above-mentioned costs. We'd like to make Wallabout an experience to remember for both those who attend and those who showcase their work.  Contributions will go towards things such as food/drinks, promotional material, venue rental, awards for winning filmmakers, and swag bags for all filmmakers/jury in attendance.
For donating, please see our perks for each amount contributed!    The Impact Why donate to Wallabout?  This is one of the few platforms in the country and world that allows students to not only curate and operate their own film festival but also include the work of fellow students from all over the world!

made in the thirties by <b>American biochemist and chemical engineer Irwin Stone</b>. <br/><p>This finding represents a huge shift
in the understanding we have of human health: ascorbic acid, better known under
the name of vitamin C, appears to be at the heart of the biochemical processes
that condition life. <br/></p><p>Taken in high doses, it proves to be more powerful than
antibiotics and kills most viruses.</p><p><b>Double Nobel Prize
Linus Pauling devoted 40 years of his life to studying and working on vitamin
C. </b><br/></p><p>He became the precursor of <b>“orthomolecular medicine”,</b> a name he coined in
1968 to refer to a form of medicine able to cure people thanks to natural
molecules that are known by the organism.</p>
<p>Eminent doctors and scientists from the whole world built on the work of
LINUS PAULING. <b>To them, there is not the shred of a doubt: Vitamin C
should be at the heart of public health systems. </b><br/></p><p>Unfortunately, health
organisations don't seem to be very interested in the preventive and curative
potential of vitamin C.</p>
<p>A great section of the medical profession always tends to refute these
studies, most of the time out of ignorance about the real properties of this
molecule. It is true that pharmacy and medicine faculties do not offer any
specific tuition on this subject. </p>

This
film constitutes a unique opportunity to deal with the Vitamin C topic in an in-depth
manner and to provide a real
audio-visual reference to the widest audience possible across the world. A UNIQUE INVESTIGATION SHOT AROUND THE WORLD :
JAPAN / USA / ARGENTINA / FRANCE / SPAIN AUSTRIA / ALGERIA / BELGIUM / TUNISIA MOROCCO / GERMANY / CANADA...
Now is the opportunity to benefit from the making of a quality movie 
that will be released for FREE on Youtube in 2016. Thanks to YOUR 
support.To date, there is no satisfying documentary
that can provide a clear and detailed picture of the situation to the general
public. WARNINGThe film in no way replaces a medical consultation or advice of health care professionals. Only your doctor or specialist is authorized to establish a medical diagnosis and the appropriate treatment.We recall that this film is not intended to create a controversy over conventional medicine. Instead, the film will present tangible facts, experiences and discoveries.
On February the 9th, 2014, the BBC published an article on a team of American
scientists who obtained surprising results in the treatment of cancer by
massive intravenous injections of vitamin C.

In Japan, following the Fukushima disaster, Professor Atsuo
Yanagisawa successfully treated Japanese soldiers using the same method.
So why isn’t this research pushed further and the results obtained with the use of Vitamin C made public? Check this video :

Orthomolecular medicine draws its origins from a revolutionary discovery
made in the thirties by American biochemist and chemical engineer Irwin Stone. This finding represents a huge shift
in the understanding we have of human health: ascorbic acid, better known under
the name of vitamin C, appears to be at the heart of the biochemical processes
that condition life. Taken in high doses, it proves to be more powerful than
antibiotics and kills most viruses.Double Nobel Prize
Linus Pauling devoted 40 years of his life to studying and working on vitamin
C. He became the precursor of “orthomolecular medicine”, a name he coined in
1968 to refer to a form of medicine able to cure people thanks to natural
molecules that are known by the organism.
Eminent doctors and scientists from the whole world built on the work of
LINUS PAULING. To them, there is not the shred of a doubt: Vitamin C
should be at the heart of public health systems. Unfortunately, health
organisations don't seem to be very interested in the preventive and curative
potential of vitamin C.
A great section of the medical profession always tends to refute these
studies, most of the time out of ignorance about the real properties of this
molecule. It is true that pharmacy and medicine faculties do not offer any
specific tuition on this subject. 
So what should we think of the silence that reins around some truly
spectacular results? The film will be shot in Japan, USA, France, Algeria, Tunisia, Spain, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Morocco, Germany and Canada depending on the funds collected. 
Several international specialists in orthomolecular medicine and researchers will be 
interviewed from their workplace.Their discourses will crosscut each other to draw up an overview of the global situation. Their input will widen the field
 of the possible applications of this molecule in our daily lives. They 
will reveal cases of conclusive experiments but also of known healings 
and explain to us why their research is trapped in silence.They will discuss amongst other the following : poliomyelitis
 & pneumonia, cot death, nuclear radiation, hepatitises primary 
infection, multi drug and ultra resistant tuberculosis, cancer…- Dr Ilyes BAGHLI, ALGERIA : President of the Algerian Society for Nutrition and Orthomolecular Medecine (SANMO), - Pr. Thomas Edward LEVY, USA :

Monaam Kraïem, a young French Filmmaker, is the author of
 the film. 
He would have never known
about the Tuberculosis intravenous Vitamin C protocol, had Sourour, his fiancée, not almost lost her life to this disease.
On the basis of his experience,
 he decided to share the fruits of his investigation on the matter in 
this documentary movie. Find out about his story here :This film originates from a personal
initiative that is supported by a
team of professionals with demonstrated quality technical skills. Its
“ free ” nature is the pledge of its integrity. It is not a documentary movie produced by a TV channel for a TV channel. It is about an intention
that is based on a citizen spirit and motivation, on a real-life story with a
desire to convey what has happened in a sincere manner. We are not after
sensational news or controversy, but we rather seek enlightened objectivity. 

This movie will be shot from September 2015 to April 2016.We will have amazing interviews and experiences from all around the world to share that will have huge impact in helping people understand Vitamin C properties.

The movie will be released for FREE on Youtube by the end of 2016 so that everybody will be able to access this medical revolution and spread the word.
This movie will also be submitted to national TVs around the world.Every single contribution means a great deal to us.
We are asking for your support in helping raise at least $125,000 to make this film a reality.

This will allow us to keep
our editorial line intact and to shield ourselves from various influences
dictated by an institutional hierarchy. Your involvement is a critical success factor. Reaching $250,000 will allow us to expand the film even further and also enhance the films quality, content and impact. It will allow us to spend more time in each country with the experts.Reaching $350,000 will allow us to produce a longer movie and talk about more experiences. Moreover, we will be able to go to New Zealand and South America where other experiences can be gathered.Over $350,000, all funds will be dedicated to clinical research.Quality content is critical if we want to reach people, research, and authorities, and to change people's mind about these discoveries.

Every single dollar counts, and assists in making this film possible.Other Ways You Can Help

Et si la Vitamine C était la molécule oubliée ? 

Ce film documentaire est une enquête inédite qui sera menée dans les pays suivants :JAPON / USA / ARGENTINE / FRANCE / ESPAGNE AUTRICHE / ALGERIE / BELGIQUE / TUNISIE MAROC / ALLEMAGNE / CANADA...
Ce film propose un état des lieux à travers le monde et constitue une occasion unique de traiter du sujet de la vitamine C
 de manière approfondie et de fournir une référence audiovisuelle au 
public le plus large possible.AVERTISSEMENTLe film ne remplacera en aucune façon une 
consultation médicale ou les conseils de tout autre professionnel de 
santé. Seul votre médecin généraliste ou spécialiste est habilité à 
l’établissement d’un diagnostic médical et à l’établissement du 
traitement adapté qui en découle. Nous
 rappelons que ce film n’a pas pour vocation de créer une polémique 
autour de la médecine conventionnelle. Au contraire, ce film exposera 
des faits tangibles, des expériences et des découvertes avérées.A ce jour, aucun documentaire satisfaisant n'offre une vue claire et précise de la situation pour le public.C'est l'opportunité de bénéficier d'un film de qualité accessible à tout le monde, le film sera diffusé gratuitement sur youtube. 
La BBC publie le 9
février 2014 un article sur une équipe de chercheurs américains ayant obtenus
des résultats surprenants sur des cas de cancer en administrant des doses
massives de vitamine C par voie intraveineuse.
Au Japon, après
la catastrophe de Fukushima le professeur Atsuo Yanagisawa soigne avec succès des
soldats japonais irradiés selon la même méthode.Pourquoi alors ne pas pousser les recherches et rendre
publiques les résultats obtenus autour de la vitamine C? Regardez cette vidéo...
La médecine orthomoléculaire puise ses origines dans une découverte révolutionnaire réalisée dans les années 30 par le biochimiste et ingénieur chimiste américain Irwin Stone. Cette découverte bouleverse la compréhension de la santé humaine : l’acide ascorbique, plus connu sous le nom de vitamine C, serait au cœur des processus biochimiques qui conditionnent la vie. A haute dose, elle est plus puissante que les antibiotiques et tue la plupart des virus.Le double prix Nobel Linus Pauling consacre 40 années d’études et de travaux sur la vitamine C. Il donnera naissance à la « médecine orthomoléculaire », un nom inventé par lui en 1968 pour désigner une médecine capable de soigner l’individu par un apport de molécules naturelles et connues de l’organisme.Les travaux de LINUS PAULING sont repris par d’éminents médecins et scientifiques du monde entier. Pour eux, cela ne fait aucun doute : la Vitamine C devrait être au cœur des dispositifs de santé publique. Malheureusement, les organismes de santé semblent peu intéressés par le potentiel préventif et curatif de la vitamine C. Une grande partie du corps médical a toujours tendance à réfuter ces études, la plupart du temps par méconnaissance des propriétés réelles de cette molécule. Il est vrai que les facultés de médecine et de pharmacie ne délivrent aucun enseignement spécifique à ce sujet. Pourtant des Prix Nobel, des professeurs, des scientifiques, des médecins du monde entier ont produits depuis longtemps des études qui démontrent l’efficacité de la molécule.Que penser alors du silence fait autour de certains résultats spectaculaires ? Le film sera tourné au Japon, aux Etats-Unis, en Argentine, en France, en Espagne, en Autriche, en Algérie, en Belgique, en Tunisie, au Maroc, en Allemagne et au Canada...
Plusieurs spécialistes internationaux de la médecine ortho moléculaire interviennent respectivement sur leurs lieux d’exercices. Les discours se croisent pour nous dresser un tableau de la situation globale. Ils complètent les propos de l’entourage de l'auteur et élargissent le champ des possibilités d’application de cette molécule dans notre quotidien. Ils nous révèlent des cas d’expériences concluantes mais aussi des guérisons reconnues et nous explique les raisons du silence qui entoure leurs recherches.Il sera question ente autre de : poliomyélite & pneumonie; mort subite du nourrisson; radiations nucléaires; hépatites; tuberculoses primo-infection, multi et ultra résistante; cancers;… - Dr Ilyes BAGHLI, ALGERIA : Président de la Société Algérienne de Nutrition et Médecine Orthomoléculaire. - Pr.

<p><b>Changing the Pecking Order</b> is the first
installment in the <b>Victims of Misfortune</b> feature-length documentary series.  Changing the Pecking Order will boldly
confront the problems of America’s criminal justice system and the devastating
impact it has left on poor communities, mostly people of African and Latino descent. We
went around the country interviewing leading scholars, activists,
reentry/criminal justice policy reform experts and historians discussing topics
such as:</p>
<ul><li>Racism in the Criminal Justice System </li></ul>
<ul><li>Police Brutality </li></ul>
<ul><li>Indentured Servitude and Chattel Slavery</li></ul>
<ul><li>Unfair Public Policies/Legal Discrimination</li></ul>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary 
Changing the Pecking Order is the first
installment in the Victims of Misfortune feature-length documentary series.  Changing the Pecking Order will boldly
confront the problems of America’s criminal justice system and the devastating
impact it has left on poor communities, mostly people of African and Latino descent. We
went around the country interviewing leading scholars, activists,
reentry/criminal justice policy reform experts and historians discussing topics
such as:
Racism in the Criminal Justice System 
Police Brutality 
Indentured Servitude and Chattel Slavery
Unfair Public Policies/Legal Discrimination
School to Prison Pipeline
Incarceration as a Business/Prison Profiteers 
Solutions for people post conviction
And so much more.



   What We Need & What You Get 
We passionately
want to make this unfiltered, social documentary with the criminal justice
system as a backdrop.  This is where we need your help!  Our
overall goal is to raise $20,000.00 to complete the project (Post
Production). 
So far we’ve invested a lot of money,
countless hours researching, investigating, planning and filming.  Now we
need your help to finish the post- production phase.  The challenge with this project
or with any project that involves history is archival materials are needed.
Most of these materials are very pricey ($100.00 per photo and up with some video
clips being even more expensive). This is why our campaign must be a success in order
to get usage of these materials. 
Pledge any amount from $10 to $1,000
and receive rewards for your support.  
The money raised through indiegogo will be used for:
Licensing archival video/photo/audio content
Creating animated special effects & titles
Combining all of these elements: rendering,
compositing, sound design and editing. 
Editing hardware and software to create
everything at high resolution to screen theatrically. 

Media promotions for the release of the
film. (In Select Theaters)
Film Rewards
Professional Mixing/Mastering of
Audio
Replication of Final Product
Marketing Materials
Creation of the Victims of
Misfortune Official Movie Trailer

this project on social media (Facebook, Twitter etc) with all your friends.

<p>A Thousand Reasons is a
modern, faith-based romantic comedy. It's unlike anything that has ever been
written, let alone turned into a movie. It's what happens when you take a film like American Pie, The Hangover or Old School and toss a little faith into it! It's an interesting mix, but it's highly entertaining and has a great message, for believers and non-believers.<br/>
<br/>
It's the story of four best friends and their journey that's full love, loss, faith and what happens when those three
aspects come together and where life takes you. Sometimes life takes us down a
road we didn't expect to travel. But everything has a purpose. Everything
happens for a reason. Or so that is what we would like to think.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Making a ""Faith-Based Feature
Film for those who do not believe.</b></p>
<p>Here's
the big difference between the feature film I am trying to create and the
countless Christian or faith-based films already on the market. I am attempting
to make a film that can be enjoyed by both audiences, the audience that
believes and the audience that does not.<br/>
<br/>
The main character of the story, Lucas, believes in God. His faith is tested,
and its a difficult road for him to travel. But his former best friend, Mason,
who Lucas has not seen since their college years, is determined to not let him
travel that road alone. His best friend does not believe in God, however. So
how can someone who does not believe help someone who does not lose their
faith? It's an interesting dilemma, that's for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike other ""faith-based"" films, I do not see the non-believer as
the bad guy of the movie. Contrary to that belief, he is actually one of the
most crucial parts of Lucas' story. But he does not and will not change his
viewpoint on God. Is it possible for two people, who have two completely
difference stances on God, to travel down the  road of faith together? And
if so, what does that road look like?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why Crowdfunding? That's a good
question!</b></p>
<p>How we create this movie is as important as what we are creating. Crowdfunding
offers an opportunity to consciously create the world around us - to support
projects that matter to us. If you feel that it's important for
""faith-based"" films like this one to be made, and you want to help me get
the message delivered in this film, then I invite you to co-create this project
with me! Share this with your friends, your networks and communities - and if
you feel compelled to jump in as one of the financial co-creators, please check
out all the amazing rewards offered on the sidebar, and find the level that
feels right for you. <br/>
<br/>
The more support we receive from you, the more effectively we can co-create
this movie in a way that holds true to it's values and core messages.  Our
goal is to raise $40,000. If we can surpass this goal, we can increase
production value and attention to detail. In other words it will look better,
sound better, and most importantly, the message and the film will reach more
people and screens.  <br/>
<br/>
With your help, my team and I are going to make the best
""faith-based"" feature film ever produced. That's a bold statement for
me to make, I know. But it is a bold statement that I definitely plan to back
up. <br/>
<br/>
You have A THOUSAND REASONS to not donate to this feature film. But I am hoping
you will look inside your heart and find the one reason you should. Whatever
that reason may be, I'm sure it is different for everyone. But if you feel like
this is something you would like to support, we would love it if you would join
us in supporting us bring this unique feature film and it's message to the film
industry and audiences world wide!<br/>

Leer esta crónica me conmovió tanto que  de inmediato me senté a escribir el guión de Sótano 5; un cortometraje de ficción  que detalla el profundo daño físico y psicológico al que son sometidos algunos jóvenes apresados tras las manifestaciones estudiantiles de 2014 en Venezuela. Como estaba inspirado en una crónica de Padrón, le envié el
guión del corto y de inmediato se involucró con la causa prestando su imagen y
asesoría para el proyecto. 
Es necesario que el mundo vea que hay tortura en Venezuela.El CortoRicardo
y Luis ya tienen muchos meses en  “La Tumba”, una prisión que está cinco
pisos bajo tierra, donde son víctimas de
tortura blanca. Su rutina cambia cuando ingresan a otro chico en esas celdas de
2x3. Le explican al “nuevo” que aquí nunca ven la luz del sol,  la única forma de saber la
hora es cuando el Metro de Caracas deja de pasar sobre ellos después de las 11 de la
noche. Que debe tener cuidado con lo que dice porque todo lo escuchan. Los días
pasan con la temperatura a 15 grados centígrados y la única forma de comunicarse es gritando
de celda a celda, porque no se pueden ver. 
La tortura se
hace cada vez más insoportable, la única forma de salir es confesando crímenes no cometidos o inculpando a alguien más.
Pero una canción común, cantada de celda a celda, les recuerda que están presos por una
causa más grande que ellos y que tal vez algún día se hará justicia. 
La filmación
de Sótano 5 se realizará en dos días de rodaje con un grupo de actores y técnicos del mundo del cine y la publicidad
venezolanos que se encuentran a lo largo  de latinoamérica.  Con equipos
fílmicos profesionales. 
El
cortometraje tendrá 3 locaciones: la celda, el baño, y un pequeño patio.
Para ello se
construirá en un estudio de grabación una réplica de “La Tumba” a partir de los testimonios de los familiares y abogados de las
víctimas.  Sería la primera vez que se vean imágenes (al menos
similares) de este reclusorio.

<p><b>WHAT IS <i>PRECIOUS CARGO</i>? </b></p>
<p><b>The Basics: </b></p>
<p><i>Precious Cargo</i> is a comedic web series exploring the world of tutoring in New York City. It is the ridiculous and, at times, poignant story of the tutors who tend to the Big Apple’s wealthiest and most elite youngsters. This series will take you through the trials and tribulations of a unique pair of sisters as they attempt to balance their own lives with the lives of the affluent yet dysfunctional families for whom they work. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>The Plot: </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Lisa and Sandy are sisters, but they couldn’t be more different. Lisa is a type A, super focused actor who takes her day job tutoring the children of Manhattan’s elite very seriously. Sandy is a dreamer, a wanderer, with her hands in a bit of everything: pottery, sitar lessons, capoeira...every day, one passion flames out and a new one replaces it. When Lisa hooks Sandy up with a job at Tomorrow's Child of the Future tutoring company, she expects her to crash and burn. But the tables turn when, all of the sudden, Sandy is in high demand for her playful teaching methods, and Lisa’s job is in jeopardy. When you’re dealing with New York’s persnickety rich and famous and their precious cargo, you never know how things will turn out. </p><p>

This epic adventure will portray the experiences of three professional performance artists throughout their travels across the Pacific West Coast and to various locations throughout North America. Documenting the experiences and extending them to audiences via Youtube and Vimeo mini series, these artists wish to share all the possibilities, opportunities, and beauty of life on the road.

These video series will be updated weekly to share such experiences as: Extreme Sports Activities, Travelers Discussions and Interviews, Fire Performances, Harmless Pranks, DJ and Music Performances, Transformational Music Festivals and Discoveries you could only make on the golden highways.

From setting world records to coaching XGAMES contestants, Kreature has left a lasting impression on the world in his surroundings. He is most well known for his work as Co-Founder/Resident Artist and coordinator of Level Space Fire Collective in Southern California, and his ability to wow a crowd with fire and sound wherever he goes.</p><p> As our social networks attention grows exponentially we will then take this series to a larger network such as MTV or Discovery to extend our experiences even further and inspire those with similar interest.

</p><div>
<p>Most people are dreamers stuck in the rate race of life. But
there are some who refuse to be a part of it and do what they dream of. Their passion for their dream defines
their identity and gives them a sense of purpose in life.<br/>
<br/>
'One Life, One Passion' is a photography project that aims at telling stories
of these individuals by combining rich visual imagery with written narratives.
Subjects include bikers, musicians, artists, social &amp; creative
entrepreneurs and many others who are living their lives around their passion.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<b>What prompted this project?</b><br/><br/>I
am an Engineer and an MBA from Mumbai, India and worked in corporate life for 7
years before realizing that the raison d’être of my life lies in my long time
hobby, photography. Thus more than a year ago I started on a journey of
creating a new identity for myself as a lifestyle photographer.<br/>
<br/>
One fine day while sitting alone in my house, it occurred to me that there must
be scores of people like me who have refused to be drawn into the rat race and
instead have decided to follow their passion. I needed to find them, meet
them and tell their stories through my photography. The idea for 'One Life, One
Passion' was born.<br/>
<br/>
Co-incidentally it was during this time that I learned that a lady called <a href=""http://www.stephmoto-adventurebikeblog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steph Jeavons</a><a href=""http://www.stephmoto-adventurebikeblog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a> was arriving in Mumbai as a part of her solo trip around the globe on
her Honda CRF 250. She hoped to travel through at least 6 continents and 42
countries in one and an half years. I instantly knew that she was the kind of
person I was looking for to start my project. To be frank, I actually thought
she is God's way of saying, ""You should do this project"". I contacted
her on Facebook, briefed her on what I wanted to do and she obliged. So, in
June 2014 I began 'One Life, One Passion' with Steph Jeavons.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433313219/zh2jxqyeiu3fnjqrfqrj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

</p>
</div><b>How has </b><b>the journey </b><b>been so far?<br/><br/></b>It's
been a wonderful ride so far. The biggest advantage of this project has been
the opportunity to meet passionate and self-motivated individuals from
different walks of life and hear their respective experiences first-hand. I
find out about them from various sources- referrals, newspaper articles,
Interest groups on Facebook and other online media. Once I identify someone who
I think fits the bill, I initiate contact and meet him over a face to face
discussion. It's during this meeting that I understand the person, his
personality, his passion, how he does his passion and his vision for his
passion. Then at the end of this meeting I work out a schedule for the shoot
based on mutual convenience and brief him about how I want to move forward on
the project.<br/>
<br/>
So far I have photographed about 10 passionate individuals- <br/><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/adventurers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/adventurers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2 bikers</a>, <br/><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/samir-karnik/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/samir-karnik/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A luthier (guitar maker)</a>, <br/><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/komal-khadse/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/komal-khadse/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A classical Indian danseuse</a>, <br/><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/darshan-lodaya/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/darshan-lodaya/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">An independent electronic music producer</a>, <br/><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/paaduks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/paaduks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A maker of Eco-friendly shoes</a>, <br/><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/megha-gupta/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/megha-gupta/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A founder of social e-commerce start-up</a>, <br/><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/arushi-aggarwal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://rohanpotdar.com/project/arushi-aggarwal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A product designer making sustainable home products</a>, <br/>and couple more

Where am I going to use the funds?I
am aiming at raising $4,400 through this campaign.  Following is the break-up of funds usage:


Close to half of the funds are going to be spent
on making a 5 minute video for the story of each individual. In total, I will
be creating 5 videos

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>After millions of years of evolution, human beings have not learned how to coexist peacefully. Differences in race, sexual orientation, religion are still reasons to hate one another.  It just breaks my heart to see so many manifestations of hate lately. You can see it written on the walls, shout out in public, at schools at work... Minorities being attacked are becoming more common each day that passes. And the scary part is that people are starting to see this as normal.  In times like this, more than ever before, we need to share this film to the world.  A film that shows us, despite our differences, how similar we are from each other.  We were designed to be one race, humans and created to speak one language: LOVE.  We can change the course of a life with a kiss, a hug, a cry, a smile, a laughter... and this emotions mean the same thing all around the globe because it's the human's way to speak LOVE.</p>
<p>Films have become a great mechanism to influence in peoples opinions and their way of looking at life. Let Language Barrier be your voice and let us be the voice of those who feel speechless in a world that rejects them for no reason.</p>

So I wrote something like, ""To whomever owns this bus: I've noticed it sitting here for the last four years and just wonder what its story is."" I left my email address and drew a little bus on the note for good measure, figuring I'd never hear back. But a few days later, I got my reply. ""You asked for my story..."" it read. ""Here's a start. I will be 39 in November of this year. I am the youngest, yet the largest and strongest of all that have come before me.

He shared that, after years of caring for the bus, he had decided to rebuild the engine with his son and send it off with him as a high school graduation gift - a father-son bonding project. But when his son abruptly lost interest partway through, he didn't have the heart to finish the job. So when we finally met in person, Tim told me that he had been awake all night deliberating, and felt unable to put a price tag on a bus that held such deep significance to him. Instead, he wanted to give it to me, its next rightful owner. I named her Bella.</p><p>Since that day Bella has served as a living room and creative space before her engine was reassembled, an ambassador to meeting new people as I figured out how to get her back on the road, and a band-mobile/musical inspiration to my <a href=""http://roguelobster1.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bluegrass-folk band</a>.

He shared that, after years of caring for the bus, he had decided to rebuild the engine with his son and send it off with him as a high school graduation gift - a father-son bonding project. But when his son abruptly lost interest partway through, he didn't have the heart to finish the job. So when we finally met in person, Tim told me that he had been awake all night deliberating, and felt unable to put a price tag on a bus that held such deep significance to him. Instead, he wanted to give it to me, its next rightful owner. I named her Bella.Since that day Bella has served as a living room and creative space before her engine was reassembled, an ambassador to meeting new people as I figured out how to get her back on the road, and a band-mobile/musical inspiration to my bluegrass-folk band. (She's even got a song on our new album!)Bella has become a feature of Walla Walla street traffic, and recently enjoyed a moment of fame as the feature of a newspaper article. Soon, she and I will soon be embarking on our first road adventure together, along with my intrepid college roommate Suzanne. Tapping into the power of email, Facebook, Instagram, phones, and good old-fashioned sticky notes, we will trace a seven-week loop through the American West, camping and exploring and meeting as many Volks folks as we can.WHERE YOU COME INThis project begins with a bus, but it is about people. I want to capture the character of this car by turning the camera on its people. You can follow our journey on our website at vwstoryproject.com. Also look for us on Instagram and Facebook. All three members of this project will need plenty of fuel to get through the summer - all donations will go towards gas and food. Please help make this dream a reality!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Short Summary</span><br/>
</h3> <p>""Bumpkins"" is a female-driven, rural comedy webseries about Fern and Amber Lynn, best friends learning how to be adults at two different stages in womanhood. They are two medium-sized fish in a small town pond and the series is as if the shows ""Portlandia"" and ""Broad City"" had a country baby. We want to embrace the rural lifestyle and echo comedy and moments that come from the truths of living in a country town. </p>
<p>The story involves Fern and Amber Lynn's daily lives, where they work, where they play, the people they surround themselves with and the rustic atmosphere in which they live. Your contribution will go towards locations, food, and props like canoes, caskets, dog kennels, musical instruments, riding lawn mowers and above-ground pools. We're not gonna  be fancy, we're gonna to be down-home funny.</p>
<p>""Bumpkins"" takes place in a small, country town and will be filmed in Easton, Maryland. We love this setting because it is beautiful, charming and the town encompasses everything the story needs. In this case, production has to travel to the location which means we have to transport things like crew and equipment. Your contributions will allow us to bring in our production requirements. </p>
<h2>Our New Approach: </h2>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435115576/vqj2ugpvmbyxhzvzfuht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>A few weeks ago we launched a <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexismorrell/bumpkins-rural-comedy-webseries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kickstarter</a> that got us attention and some wonderful donations. It peaked people's curiosity about our project and earned us a fantastic audience. The Kickstarter was not fulfilled, therefore, we didn't get the money via that avenue. We have launched this IndieGoGo to help ensure that we can secure funding in both an internet/crowdfunding way as well as by raising awareness and getting attention on the ground, locally in Maryland. </div>
<div>During the month of July, Alexis Morrell will be on the East Coast, in Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware talking to people and gaining to get local support. </div>

<p>We want this series to be like a hug for the community. We want the series to feel as authentically rural and rustic as possible and the comedy to come from a place we can appreciate as home-grown. </p>

<p>Ahmed Alabaca was raised in a troubled neighborhood in San Bernardino California, Alabaca began composing and playing the piano at age 6, finding an escape from reality in the music that flowed out of him, giving him life. Alabaca moved to New York in the summer of 2006 and readily adjusted to the life of a struggling artist in the city of dreams, buying a keyboard before he bought a bed. For a time all he did was compose and work.While in NYC, Alabaca earned his B.A. in Music from Hunter College, took classes at Julliard, and earned his New York State teaching certificate. Alabaca began to deeply explore scoring while collaborating on original theater projects, using his music as part of the performance “text”, exploring how to make music a vital and necessary part of the artistic whole as opposed to an unnecessary element superimposed onto the production.</p>
<p>Now, after moving back to California, Alabaca is composing and performing for various projects throughout the Los Angeles Area.</p>

<h3><b>DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT: </b></h3>
<h3><b>Why I am making this: </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>I think it’s a mixture of living in a small town surrounded by fields, taping over childhood home movies with episodes of “The Nanny” and “SNL” on the family VCR to watch on repeat when my homework was done and a Shania Twain obsession that have led to this moment.</i></p>
<p><i>Most writers say to write what you know and I know Fern and Amber Lynn. They are pieces of myself growing up, people I know from home, from college and from other rural areas who are trying to make the most of what they’ve got. The idea for the show came to me when I was just writing a scene for fun about this time I made a huge mistake back home and my dad called the cops on me… The thing is, he didn’t know he called the cops on me. Actually, if he reads this, it might reveal to him that he called the cops on me. I sent the scene to my friend and producing partner, Katrelle Kindred, and she said “Let’s make this.” There’s nothing more rewarding than a mistake paying off creatively. Plus, they can’t fine ya if they can’t find ya. #CountryLogic</i></p>
<p><i>I’m presently keeping that story vague as to lure you into watching this series.</i></p>
<p><i>I am so proud of the team we have brought together. We have people from all over the world, various backgrounds, ethnicities and stories coming together to make something different, entertaining and above all else, funny. We will be sacrificing time, sweat, tears and dignity to bring you a quality production. I am looking forward to the format as well, something that can be watched in webisode segments but then also enjoyed as a whole, almost as if you were watching a show from television in the 1990s. Do you remember that? I’ll break out the VCR. I still have one.</i></p>
<p><i>One last note I want to boast about is our idea of incorporating local crew, talent and businesses. We want “Bumpkins” to have an authentic feel, much like how “Portlandia” or “Broad City” are loyal to their stomping grounds and the people who inhabit them. These characters are your neighbors or your cousins. Everyone gets it, but you don’t really want them to show up at every wedding.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Thank you for being a part of Bumpkins and I can’t wait to show you what we’ve been stirring up! Yee haw!</i></p>

</div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary
 ""Bumpkins"" is a female-driven, rural comedy webseries about Fern and Amber Lynn, best friends learning how to be adults at two different stages in womanhood. They are two medium-sized fish in a small town pond and the series is as if the shows ""Portlandia"" and ""Broad City"" had a country baby. We want to embrace the rural lifestyle and echo comedy and moments that come from the truths of living in a country town. 
The story involves Fern and Amber Lynn's daily lives, where they work, where they play, the people they surround themselves with and the rustic atmosphere in which they live. Your contribution will go towards locations, food, and props like canoes, caskets, dog kennels, musical instruments, riding lawn mowers and above-ground pools. We're not gonna  be fancy, we're gonna to be down-home funny.
""Bumpkins"" takes place in a small, country town and will be filmed in Easton, Maryland. We love this setting because it is beautiful, charming and the town encompasses everything the story needs. In this case, production has to travel to the location which means we have to transport things like crew and equipment. Your contributions will allow us to bring in our production requirements. 
Our New Approach: 

A few weeks ago we launched a Kickstarter that got us attention and some wonderful donations. It peaked people's curiosity about our project and earned us a fantastic audience. The Kickstarter was not fulfilled, therefore, we didn't get the money via that avenue. We have launched this IndieGoGo to help ensure that we can secure funding in both an internet/crowdfunding way as well as by raising awareness and getting attention on the ground, locally in Maryland. 
During the month of July, Alexis Morrell will be on the East Coast, in Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware talking to people and gaining to get local support. 

Embracing Local Resources: 


We look forward to including local talent, businesses and locations to give the story a truly authentic feel. We want to have local products in our scenes, local talent performing with us, local businesses as locations and the beauty of the Eastern Shore in our shots. 
We want this series to be like a hug for the community. We want the series to feel as authentically rural and rustic as possible and the comedy to come from a place we can appreciate as home-grown. 
If you are interested in participating, please contact us at bumpkinswebseries@gmail.com for more information and details.

Music by Ahmed Alabaca 


Ahmed Alabaca was raised in a troubled neighborhood in San Bernardino California, Alabaca began composing and playing the piano at age 6, finding an escape from reality in the music that flowed out of him, giving him life. Alabaca moved to New York in the summer of 2006 and readily adjusted to the life of a struggling artist in the city of dreams, buying a keyboard before he bought a bed. For a time all he did was compose and work.While in NYC, Alabaca earned his B.A. in Music from Hunter College, took classes at Julliard, and earned his New York State teaching certificate. Alabaca began to deeply explore scoring while collaborating on original theater projects, using his music as part of the performance “text”, exploring how to make music a vital and necessary part of the artistic whole as opposed to an unnecessary element superimposed onto the production.
Now, after moving back to California, Alabaca is composing and performing for various projects throughout the Los Angeles Area.

DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT: 
Why I am making this: 

I think it’s a mixture of living in a small town surrounded by fields, taping over childhood home movies with episodes of “The Nanny” and “SNL” on the family VCR to watch on repeat when my homework was done and a Shania Twain obsession that have led to this moment.
Most writers say to write what you know and I know Fern and Amber Lynn. They are pieces of myself growing up, people I know from home, from college and from other rural areas who are trying to make the most of what they’ve got. The idea for the show came to me when I was just writing a scene for fun about this time I made a huge mistake back home and my dad called the cops on me… The thing is, he didn’t know he called the cops on me. Actually, if he reads this, it might reveal to him that he called the cops on me. I sent the scene to my friend and producing partner, Katrelle Kindred, and she said “Let’s make this.” There’s nothing more rewarding than a mistake paying off creatively. Plus, they can’t fine ya if they can’t find ya. #CountryLogic
I’m presently keeping that story vague as to lure you into watching this series.
I am so proud of the team we have brought together. We have people from all over the world, various backgrounds, ethnicities and stories coming together to make something different, entertaining and above all else, funny. We will be sacrificing time, sweat, tears and dignity to bring you a quality production. I am looking forward to the format as well, something that can be watched in webisode segments but then also enjoyed as a whole, almost as if you were watching a show from television in the 1990s. Do you remember that? I’ll break out the VCR. I still have one.
One last note I want to boast about is our idea of incorporating local crew, talent and businesses. We want “Bumpkins” to have an authentic feel, much like how “Portlandia” or “Broad City” are loyal to their stomping grounds and the people who inhabit them. These characters are your neighbors or your cousins. Everyone gets it, but you don’t really want them to show up at every wedding.

Thank you for being a part of Bumpkins and I can’t wait to show you what we’ve been stirring up! Yee haw!
-Alexis Morrell
PS - Sorry, not sorry Dad. #statuteoflimitations   What We Need & What You Get The donations will go towards:  Film equipment rentals. 
Transporting talented crew to the location.
Food for cast and crew.
Location fees.

    The Impact Our webseries will tell the stories of people from rural America. We are taking stories from growing up on the shore, deep south and mid-west and creating a comedy series to reflect the things that you just don't get in the city.     Risks & Challenges  Our greatest challenge is to create a high quality series with tons of production value with a small budget. Comedic, innovative, and truthful storytelling are our main goals for this project. However, we want to stay as true to our artistic vision as our budget will allow. Pooling all of our resources together with your financial assistance will allow us to succeed up and beyond!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Your generous donations will be the key in making this film go from an 
idea, to a reality. Our budget is $1,200, it might seem like a lot, but 
all of it will be used to progress the film. All donations will be used 
to pay our excellent actors, to feed and provide transportation to the

</div><br/></div>","There
is nothing more empowering than speaking up for yourself. SpeakYourStory was
founded on the belief that when you tell your story, not only do you discover
your own strength, but you encourage others to find their voice and stories as
well. We are passionately committed to telling the unfiltered, unedited stories of real women. We've already created an online platform to share these stories, and our success in such a short period of time has led us to dream even bigger. Our project has been completely self-funded from the beginning,  and this campaign is the next step to bring these stories to life. We are raising money for the first book in a SpeakYourStory Anthology and a 6-episode Podcast series. Story-telling plays an integral role in fighting and overcoming the forces that have marginalized and
dehumanized women throughout history. With your help we will bring the
authentic, beautiful, transformative stories of women into lives all over the
world. 
What We’ve Created So Farwww.SpeakYourStory.org began as a defiant response to the lack of authentic, real
women’s stories being told in the media and pop culture. In the beginning our
dream was simply of a website where women could share their stories. We
launched with just a handful of stories written by us and our closest
friends and family, and we asked our community to spread our message to the women
in their lives. The message was simple - you have a story to tell, we
believe your story is worthy and important, and we know others will want to
hear it. 
As the weeks went by, women from all over the country wrote to us about
loss, addiction, abortions and adoptions, body image, mental illness and even
homelessness. Yet, these stories were not tragic. Instead, they were filled
with courage, humor, survival, hope and redemption. 


Our Successes and Strategies
Just 22 weeks after launching, we’ve received
and published nearly 70 stories and had over 26,000 unique page views on our
site.
We believe our success is due to what makes us unique: 


We don’t allow comments on
the stories. We want to create the most compassionate and
safe environment possible. 

We are committed to an ad-free
website. Even though advertisements would provide a much
needed revenue stream, ad-free honors the stories and gives them the
space and attention they deserve. 

We encourage all forms of self-expression - music, art, photography, and poetry. Any medium that
women want to use to tell their stories has a home on SpeakYourStory. 

“This site is amazing. I'm going to share a story tomorrow.
Very important gathering place for us to join together in support of women.” ~Susie
Bedsow HorganWhy We NEED to Keep Going
You don’t have to look hard to see examples of
women being marginalized and dehumanized. We live in a world where we use
hashtags to memorialize black women killed by the police, lest we forget their
names. Where 1 in 3 adult women have abortions, yet restrictions to access are
growing in astronomical numbers. Where 1 in 3 women are victims of physical
violence at the hands of their intimate partners. Where 1 in 5 women report
being victims of sexual assault. And, where women are three times more likely
than men to attempt suicide.[1]


We MUST share our stories, reject being silenced and stigmatized
by our experiences, and stand unapologetically in our truths. 
By sharing our stories we also break down harmful stereotypes
that have long been used to shame women into silence – fat, ugly, bitch,
slut, bossy, crazy - labels that don’t serve us and certainly don’t define us.“Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, thank
you for this site.” ~ Manisha AntaniWe know
from Google Analytics that men and women are reading our stories in equal
numbers. These
are not women’s issues – these are human issues. We will never have meaningful
social change when 50% of the population are sidelined and silenced.

“I'm not sure I can find the right words. The first story I read was Rachael's and it hit me like a ton of bricks. Not my story, but the
fundamentals of where I am right now are the same. I read all of them after
that. You've caught the tail of something very powerful...From a male perspective, I think I, and all men, owe it to ourselves
and the world (indeed, possibly to the survival or our species), to read and
listen deeply.”    ~ Ben Beck-Coon

Worldwide.<span>  In Tagalog, “bayanihan”
means the spirit of community and cooperation that enables people to reach a common goal. </span></p><p><span>In 2008, I went back to my mother’s small village in Labo,
Camarines Norte in the Philippines. I bet you wouldn’t find it on the map of
the Philippines, which has over 7,000 islands. I was struck by the extreme poverty of
my own relatives. My cousin earns less than $2 a day patching used tires.  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439328695/snvzbl7cdcpiqigese9c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p><p><span>Many of my relatives wanted to curl up inside my luggage and come to the US with me. <b>This
was a turning point in my life.</b>  I
saw the connection between their desperation and the overwhelming number of people who feel they must
migrate to seek a better life.  </span>I just had to do something. So that same year, I sent money from the US so my
cousin’s son Vicente could go to school.<span>  Eventually
he graduated from college and is now a nurse helping his family
back in Bicol. I changed Vicente's life. I changed his world.<br/></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439328738/vczj2bkwy13bpraqpi8y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span></span><p><span>That became my first act of philanthropy. <b>I made a difference in one person’s life.</b> Small changes lead to large results.  In 2010, I established the
Bayanihan Foundation Worldwide to encourage more Filipinos and others living away from their native lands to make a
difference in people’s lives back home. </span>
</p><p>In late 2014 I committed to helping three young Filipino-Americans visit their families' homeland as part of a NEXTGEN Fellowship, supported by the Bayanihan Foundation, which organized the trip and paid for their travel expenses. I designed our two-week journey to encourage these young men and women to learn more about their origins, become more involved in creating change, and help those still living in the Philippines. In July 2015, along with members <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">of the Kaluluwa Collective, we helped restore mangrove barriers, taught students about </span>environmental<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> issues, helped clean up village waterways, and shared meals with our new friends.

NEXTGEN Fellowship is dear to my heart. It speaks to the core of why I was drawn to
help back in the Philippines.  I believe
that if you give people the right opportunity and motivation to help, they can make many small, personal changes that ultimately benefit </span>large<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> numbers of people who need help.</span></p>
<p><b>That's why I’m doing this work. </b></p><p><b>I'm asking you to donate so that young Filipino Americans can have opportunities to reconnect with their culture and heritage, learn the importance of ""reaching back"" to help others, and gain a larger sense of their responsibilities in the world.</b> Through NEXTGEN they will learn about the foundation’s sustainable projects and learn
to develop their own potential sustainable projects.<span>  Your contribution will enable us to bring more and more of the next generation of Filipinos back to the Philippines, where they will continue these projects. </span></p><p><span>I have made a substantial personal commitment to this work, and the Foundation is a recognized 501 c 3 organization, meaning your contribution is tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.

I believe that small changes lead to large results and that when you change someone's world, you change the world.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our NEXTGEN journeys are designed to put us in close contact with the people of the Philippines. We stayed and ate with families where possible and kept all our expenses to a minimum. That sometimes meant sharing a floor and not having running water!  </p><p>But traveling halfway around the world is not cheap. The Bayanihan Foundation needs $2,500 to help pay for trip
expenses, primarily international airfare costs, food, lodging, local van
travel, travel insurance, guides and service project costs. This is a small price to pay for supporting long-term, sustainable efforts to change people's lives for the better.</p>
<p>I invite you to be part of
this change and would also like to offer you some temptations to donate:</p>
<p><u>For $25, </u>receive one bag of
Philippine dried mangoes</p>

<p><u>For $250</u> – receive one “Malong,” a traditional

<p><u>For $500</u> – receive one bamboo ""good luck"" plant and all four items listed above.  </p>
<p>The foundation will use all
funds raised for the expenses of the NEXTGEN Fellowship program
and to ensure the continuation of the program for years to come. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Your donation will ensure that the NEXTGEN Fellowship will continue beyond its first year and contribute to the success of the many other
projects of the Bayanihan Foundation:</p><p><b>NextGen Youth

</p><ul>
<li>

Help us change a world and you also change the world.<br/><br/><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>I see three major risks and challenges to this campaign:</p>
<p><span>1)<span>  </span></span>Apathy – potential donors might not think that they can make a
difference and their $25 donation or any amount will not make a difference. </p>
<p><span>2)<span>  </span></span>Lack of impact – potential donors might think that their contribution of
$50 or any amount will really not make any impact. </p>
<p><span>3)<span>  </span></span>Lack of transparency – potential donors might think that their contribution
will not go towards their intended donation.</p>
<p>I assure you that your funds donated will go towards the NEXTGEN
Fellowship and the long-term sustainable projects of the Bayanihan
Foundation.<span>  Any amount you contribute
will make a difference – large or small. I believe that your donation could be the
change we want to see in this world.  And
I hope that reading this will motivate you to donate. Thank you.</span></p>

Help us change a world and you also change the world.Risks & Challenges
I see three major risks and challenges to this campaign:
1)  Apathy – potential donors might not think that they can make a
difference and their $25 donation or any amount will not make a difference. 
2)  Lack of impact – potential donors might think that their contribution of
$50 or any amount will really not make any impact. 
3)  Lack of transparency – potential donors might think that their contribution
will not go towards their intended donation.
I assure you that your funds donated will go towards the NEXTGEN
Fellowship and the long-term sustainable projects of the Bayanihan
Foundation.  Any amount you contribute
will make a difference – large or small. I believe that your donation could be the
change we want to see in this world.  And
I hope that reading this will motivate you to donate. Thank you.

<p>Who does not understand the suffering, agony and pain when a loved one vanishes all of a sudden?</p>
<p>If such is the case with a friend, partner or family member the shock and mental agony to face such a situation is an unbearable, unsurmountable struggle that a lot of people can imagine but only those who experience it, knows the reality. The pain and suffering is greater when the family members of the missing people do not have even the right to mourn over the sudden disappearance of their loved ones , and instead they are forced to live in the constant hope of new leads and answers that could possibly lead them to getting valid explanations or understanding of what really happened.</p>
<p>Now, try to imagine if something so terrible would happen to you! That someone very close and so loved, suddenly one day disappeared.</p>
<p>Death is more acceptable, and at one point in time it will allow you to mourn, understand and accept the reality. However, would you have peace with yourself if you do not know the circumstances under which a loved one vanishes without any evidence or understandable reasons?</p>
<p>What would you do without any clues? Moreover how would you feel without any power to investigate? How would you accept one as dead when that is not certain? Would you be able to turn the page and carry on with your life under such circumstances?</p>
<p>If you are still reading, perhaps we touch your heart and you understand that in certain circumstances we will have the same feelings of frustration, anger and restlessness. But we know you will fight and you won't give up searching. Those are exactly the circumstances of <b>Martha Escobar</b>; she did not give up and is still fighting over 27 years along with <b>many others</b>.</p>
<p><b>The aim of the documentary</b> will not be to focus on the missing people, but to understand the psyche of those who are searching for answers. To feel their pain and frustration in facing their terrible reality. To embrace their strength and their determination to understand what happened to their loved ones, and their continuous endless efforts to achieve success by not giving up.</p>
<p>The aim of this documentary is to experience with these people the psychological and practical conditions of the everyday struggle to find clues. <b>We want to support their courage</b> and endurance and make sure that they do not feel alone in their tireless, endless search of 'those that one day were present and visible and the day after became invisible'.</p>

<p> </p> <i><b>(IN)Visible</b></i> è un emozionante e intenso documentario che racconta le storie delle famiglie dei desaparecidos e delle loro incessanti ricerche. Il progetto del film è stato studiato, prodotto e diretto da <b>Alice Montorselli</b>.<br/> <p>Il suo ardente desiderio di dar voce alle persone che non ne hanno l'ha spinta a utilizzare le loro credenziali accademiche e la loro competenza professionale nel campo dell'audiovisivo, per fornire una voce a coloro che non ce l’hanno, l’opportunità di diffondere le informazioni necessarie su tale tema.</p>
<p>Il documentario narra della <b>forza</b> delle<b> persone</b> che quotidianamente affrontano sfide e dilemmi a causa della perdita dei propri <b>cari</b> in circostanze misteriose, dove i diritti umani sono stati violati! Il caso principale analizzato e documentato è la storia di Martha Escobar.</p>
<p>Si tratta di un documentario basato su una storia vera, che vuole dimostrare come in tali circostanze possa emergere la forza dell’essere umano.</p>

<p>Sia esso della famiglia, un amico o un amore, lo shock e il tormento di una tale situazione, rappresenta uno sforzo tremendo e insormontabile, che molti possono immaginare, ma soltanto chi lo vive ne comprende la realtà.</p>
<p>Il dolore e la sofferenza sono maggiori quando i familiari delle persone scomparse non hanno nemmeno il diritto di lutto, di piangere sull'improvvisa scomparsa dei loro cari; invece, sono costretti a vivere nella costante speranza di trovare nuovi indizi e risposte, che potrebbero fornir loro una valida spiegazione o comprensione di cosa sia realmente accaduto.</p>
<p>Ora, provate a immaginare se una cosa così terribile accadesse a voi! Che qualcuno di molto vicino e di amato improvvisamente un giorno <b>scomparisse</b>!</p>
<p>La morte è più facile da accettare e ti consente almeno di piangere, capire e accettare la realtà.</p>
<p>Per contro, riuscireste a essere in pace con voi stessi se non conosceste le circostanze in cui un vostro amato è scomparso, senza lasciare traccia o motivo comprensibile?</p>
<p>Voi che cosa fareste se vi ritrovaste senza alcun indizio? O ancora, come vi sentireste senza alcuna possibilità di fare indagini? Come potreste accettare la morte di qualcuno se non ne aveste l'assoluta certezza? Sareste in grado di voltare pagina e continuare con la vostra vita in tali circostanze?</p>
<p>Probabilmente no.</p>
<p>Se state ancora leggendo, forse abbiamo toccato il vostro cuore e capite che tutti noi, in certe circostanze, proveremmo gli stessi sentimenti di frustrazione, rabbia e inquietudine. Anzi, siamo certe che continuereste a lottare e non smettereste di cercare. Queste sono esattamente le circostanze in cui si è trovata Martha Escobar: lei non si è arresa e sta ancora lottando dopo 27 anni, assieme a molti altri.</p>
<p><b>Lo scopo di questo d</b><b>ocumentario</b> non è quello di concentrarsi sulle persone scomparse, ma quello di comprendere la psiche di coloro che sono alla ricerca di risposte. Di percepire la loro sofferenza e frustrazione in queste terribili realtà. Di abbracciare la loro forza e la loro determinazione nel capire ciò che è successo ai loro cari, e i loro continui sforzi per raggiungere la verità, senza mai mollare.</p>
<p>Lo scopo di questo documentario è di vivere con queste persone, le condizioni psicologiche e pratiche che si provano durante le lotte quotidiane alla ricerca di qualche traccia. <b>Vogliamo sostenere il loro coraggio</b> e la loro resistenza; vogliamo assicurarci che non si sentano soli nella loro instancabile e incessante ricerca di coloro che un giorno erano presenti e visibili e il giorno dopo sono diventati <i>invisibili</i>.</p>
<p><b>P</b><b>otete rendere </b><b>tutto questo</b><b> possibile</b>; un piccolo contributo da tutti voi ci permetterà di donare a queste persone la forza delle nostre voci congiunte.</p>
<p>Ogni piccola donazione è vitale e rappresenta un passo avanti per sostenere queste persone.</p>
<p>Ogni volta che condividerete questa campagna su un social network o ne parlerete con qualcuno, entrerete a far parte della nostra squadra. Proprio così! Farete parte di coloro che <b>possono fare la differenza</b>!</p>
<p>Fate la differenza con una piccola donazione! Cogliete l'opportunità di innescare una reazione a catena.</p>
<p>Desideriamo veramente, ardentemente, appassionatamente, fare questo film. Così tanto, che siamo disposte ad andare anche mangiando pane, acqua e cipolle ogni giorno. Anzi, tagliamo anche sulle cipolle! Troppo costose ;)</p>
<p>Scherzi a parte, i 17.000 USD (<b>15.000 €</b>), che ci siamo posti come obiettivo,è la cifra minima che dobbiamo raggiungere per la realizzazione del documentario in Ecuador. <b>Di meno significherebbe non </b><b>poter</b><b> andare.</b></p>
<p>In questo 21° secolo così tecnologicamente avanzato, come vorreste sostenerci nella nostra impresa per dare voce a coloro che brancolano nel buio nel trovare i propri amati?</p>
<p>Permetteteci di andare in Ecuador e vi racconteremo tutto su queste persone, che hanno bisogno di essere ascoltate.</p>

<p>¿Quién no entiende el sufrimiento, agonía y dolor cuando un ser amado desaparece de pronto?</p>
<p>Si ese fuese el caso de un amigo, pareja o un miembro de la familia, el shock y la agonía mental para enfrentar una situación así sería una lucha insoportable, insuperable, que mucha gente puede imaginar pero solo aquellos que lo han experimentado conocen la realidad. El dolor y el sufrimiento es mayor cuando los miembros de la familia del desaparecido no tienen el derecho de estar de luto por su ser querido. Al contrario, ellos son forzados a vivir en la esperanza constante de tener nuevas pistas y respuestas que puedan llevarlos a conseguir explicaciones válidas o entender que es lo que verdaderamente sucedió.</p>
<p>Ahora, intenta imaginar si algo tan terrible te pasaría a ti! Que alguien muy cercano y muy amado de pronto un día <b>desaparece</b>.</p>
<p>La muerte es más aceptable, y llega un punto en el tiempo que te permite estar de luto, entender y aceptar la realidad. Sin embargo, ¿podrías tener paz contigo mismo si tú no sabes las circunstancias bajo las cuales tu ser amado desapareció sin ningún rastro o ninguna razón comprensible?</p>
<p>¿Qué es lo que tú harías sin una sola pista? Más aún, cómo te sentirías sin poder alguno para investigar? ¿Cómo aceptarías que alguien está muerto cuando tú no tienes la certeza? ¿Podrías virar la página y continuar con tu vida bajo estas circunstancias?</p>
<p>Si tú aún estás leyendo esto, talvez nosotras tocamos tu corazón y tú entiendes que bajo ciertas circunstancias nosotros tendríamos los mismos sentimientos de frustración, ira e intranquilidad. Pero nosotros sabemos que tú lucharías y que no pararías de buscar. Esas exactamente fueron las circunstancias para Marta Escobar, ella no se rinde y aún continúa luchando por más de 27 años junto con muchos otros.</p>
<p><b>El propósito de este documental</b> no está enfocado en los desaparecidos, pero busca entender la psicología de aquellos que buscan por respuestas. Para sentir su dolor y frustración enfrentando esta terrible realidad. Para adoptar su fuerza y su determinación para entender qué pasó con sus seres queridos y con sus continuos e interminables esfuerzos para alcanzar el éxito sin darse por vencidos.</p>
<p>El propósito de este documental es experimentar con estas personas las condiciones psicológicas y prácticas de la lucha diaria por encontrar pistas. Nosotras<b> queremos apoyar su coraje</b> y su resistencia y asegurar que ellos no se sientan solos en su incansable e interminable búsqueda por ‘aquellos que un día estuvieron presentes y fueron visibles y al siguiente día se volvieron invisibles’</p>
<p><b>Tú puedes hacer esto posible</b>, y una contribución pequeña de todos ustedes nos permitirá dar la fuerza de nuestra voz combinada para estas personas.</p>
<p>Cada pequeña donación es vital y un paso adelante para apoyar a estas personas. Cada vez que tú compartes esto en una red social o discutes esto con alguien, tú te vuelves parte de nuestro grupo: ¡esto es correcto! ¡Tú serás parte de aquellos que <b>pueden hacer la diferencia</b>!</p>

<h3><b>                                    A HISTORIA</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Quem de nos nao seria capaz de entender a sofrencia, a agonia e a dor da perda de uma pessoa amada?</p>
<p>Seja essa uma pessoa da familia, um amigo querido, um amor. O choque e a tormenta de tal situacao, representa um esforco temendo e imensuravel, que muitos podem imaginar, mas somente alguns vivem e coomprendem a realidade.</p>
<p>A dor e a sofrencia sao maiores quando os familiares da pessoa desaparecida nao possuem ao menos o direito de luto, de lamentar a perda repentina de seu ente querido; invez disso, sao obrigadas a viver com a constante esperança de achar novos indicios ou respostas, que possam dar a elas uma vàlida explicaçao ou coomprensao do que realmente aconteceu.</p>
<p>Agora, tente imaginar se uma coisa terrivel dessas acontecesse com voce! Que qualquer um, muito proximo e querido, de repente, de um dia para o outro, <b>desaparecesse</b>!</p>
<p>A morte é mais facil de aceitar e se se tem ao menos o direito de lamentar, entender e aceitar os fatos. É impossivel conseguir ficar em paz com voce mesmo se nao tiver ao menos o conhecimento ou a condicao na qual um ente querido é dado como desaparecido; sem deixar rastros ou um motivo no minimo coompreensivel.</p>
<p>O que faria se se encontrasse sem algum indicio? Ou até, come se sentiria sem alguma possibilidade de fazer uma investigacao? Como poderia aceitar a morte de qualquer um se nao tivesse a absoluta certeza que de fato é morto? Seria capaz de virar a pagina e continuar a sua vida sob tal situacao?</p>
<p>Pravavelmente nao.</p>
<p>Se voce ainda esta lendo, talvez tenhamos tocado o seu coracao e entende que todos nos, sob tais circunstacias, teriamos os mesmos sentimentos de raiva, frustacao, inquietude. Estamos certos que continuaria a lutar e a nao iria parar de procurar e buscar por pistas. Essas sao as condicoes que se encontra Martha Escobar: ela nao ainda nao desistiu e ainda esta lutando, mesmo apos 27 anos, junto com muitos outros.</p>
<p><b>O objetivo desse documentario</b> nao é se concentrar nas pessoas desaparecidas, mas sim naquelas que ficam e estudar a sua psique que estao a procura de respostas. De sentir a dor e a frustacao dessa terrivel realidade. De abracar a sua forca e a sua determinacao de entender o que aconteceu a seus entes queridos e o esforco continuo para alcancar a verdade, sem desistir.</p>
<p>Esse documentario mostra a vivencia com essas pessoas, a condicao psicologica e pratica na qual se encontram durante a luta cotidiana atras de qualquer tracos ou rastros que os desaparecidos possam ter deixado. <b>Queremos apoiar a sua coragem</b> e a sua resistencia. Queremos assegurar que nao se sintam sozinhas na sua incansavel e incessante busca daqueles que um dia ja foram presentes e visivies e que no dia seguinte se tornam invisiveis.</p>

Death is more acceptable, and at one point in time it will allow you to mourn, understand and accept the reality. However, would you have peace with yourself if you do not know the circumstances under which a loved one vanishes without any evidence or understandable reasons?

The USD 17.000 that we set as the goal is the minimum that we need to achieve the realization of the documentary in Ecuador. Less will mean we cannot possibly be able to go.
 
How would you like to support us in our passionate venture to give voice to those who are groping in the dark to find their own loved ones, but in vain, in the technologically advanced 21st century?
Send us to Ecuador and we will tell you everything about these people who need to be heard.
 
Thank you!

  (IN)Visible è un emozionante e intenso documentario che racconta le storie delle famiglie dei desaparecidos e delle loro incessanti ricerche. Il progetto del film è stato studiato, prodotto e diretto da Alice Montorselli. Il suo ardente desiderio di dar voce alle persone che non ne hanno l'ha spinta a utilizzare le loro credenziali accademiche e la loro competenza professionale nel campo dell'audiovisivo, per fornire una voce a coloro che non ce l’hanno, l’opportunità di diffondere le informazioni necessarie su tale tema.
Il documentario narra della forza delle persone che quotidianamente affrontano sfide e dilemmi a causa della perdita dei propri cari in circostanze misteriose, dove i diritti umani sono stati violati! Il caso principale analizzato e documentato è la storia di Martha Escobar.
Si tratta di un documentario basato su una storia vera, che vuole dimostrare come in tali circostanze possa emergere la forza dell’essere umano.
 
 
 Chi di noi non capirebbe la sofferenza, l'agonia e il dolore della perdita di una persona amata?
Sia esso della famiglia, un amico o un amore, lo shock e il tormento di una tale situazione, rappresenta uno sforzo tremendo e insormontabile, che molti possono immaginare, ma soltanto chi lo vive ne comprende la realtà.
Il dolore e la sofferenza sono maggiori quando i familiari delle persone scomparse non hanno nemmeno il diritto di lutto, di piangere sull'improvvisa scomparsa dei loro cari; invece, sono costretti a vivere nella costante speranza di trovare nuovi indizi e risposte, che potrebbero fornir loro una valida spiegazione o comprensione di cosa sia realmente accaduto.
Ora, provate a immaginare se una cosa così terribile accadesse a voi! Che qualcuno di molto vicino e di amato improvvisamente un giorno scomparisse!
La morte è più facile da accettare e ti consente almeno di piangere, capire e accettare la realtà.
Per contro, riuscireste a essere in pace con voi stessi se non conosceste le circostanze in cui un vostro amato è scomparso, senza lasciare traccia o motivo comprensibile?
Voi che cosa fareste se vi ritrovaste senza alcun indizio? O ancora, come vi sentireste senza alcuna possibilità di fare indagini? Come potreste accettare la morte di qualcuno se non ne aveste l'assoluta certezza? Sareste in grado di voltare pagina e continuare con la vostra vita in tali circostanze?
Probabilmente no.
Se state ancora leggendo, forse abbiamo toccato il vostro cuore e capite che tutti noi, in certe circostanze, proveremmo gli stessi sentimenti di frustrazione, rabbia e inquietudine. Anzi, siamo certe che continuereste a lottare e non smettereste di cercare. Queste sono esattamente le circostanze in cui si è trovata Martha Escobar: lei non si è arresa e sta ancora lottando dopo 27 anni, assieme a molti altri.
Lo scopo di questo documentario non è quello di concentrarsi sulle persone scomparse, ma quello di comprendere la psiche di coloro che sono alla ricerca di risposte. Di percepire la loro sofferenza e frustrazione in queste terribili realtà. Di abbracciare la loro forza e la loro determinazione nel capire ciò che è successo ai loro cari, e i loro continui sforzi per raggiungere la verità, senza mai mollare.
Lo scopo di questo documentario è di vivere con queste persone, le condizioni psicologiche e pratiche che si provano durante le lotte quotidiane alla ricerca di qualche traccia. Vogliamo sostenere il loro coraggio e la loro resistenza; vogliamo assicurarci che non si sentano soli nella loro instancabile e incessante ricerca di coloro che un giorno erano presenti e visibili e il giorno dopo sono diventati invisibili.
Potete rendere tutto questo possibile; un piccolo contributo da tutti voi ci permetterà di donare a queste persone la forza delle nostre voci congiunte.
Ogni piccola donazione è vitale e rappresenta un passo avanti per sostenere queste persone.
Ogni volta che condividerete questa campagna su un social network o ne parlerete con qualcuno, entrerete a far parte della nostra squadra. Proprio così! Farete parte di coloro che possono fare la differenza!
Fate la differenza con una piccola donazione! Cogliete l'opportunità di innescare una reazione a catena.
Desideriamo veramente, ardentemente, appassionatamente, fare questo film. Così tanto, che siamo disposte ad andare anche mangiando pane, acqua e cipolle ogni giorno. Anzi, tagliamo anche sulle cipolle! Troppo costose ;)
Scherzi a parte, i 17.000 USD (15.000 €), che ci siamo posti come obiettivo,è la cifra minima che dobbiamo raggiungere per la realizzazione del documentario in Ecuador. Di meno significherebbe non poter andare.
In questo 21° secolo così tecnologicamente avanzato, come vorreste sostenerci nella nostra impresa per dare voce a coloro che brancolano nel buio nel trovare i propri amati?
Permetteteci di andare in Ecuador e vi racconteremo tutto su queste persone, che hanno bisogno di essere ascoltate.
Grazie!

                                                     - ESPAÑOL - (IN) visible es un documental inspirador acerca de los familiares de desaparecidos y su búsqueda interminable por pistas que los ayuden a encontrarlos. Este proyecto cinematográfico italiano ha sido investigado, producido y dirigido por Alice Montorselli.
Su pasión por dar voz a la gente que no la tiene, la llevó a utilizar su credenciales académicas y su experiencia profesional como experta audio-visuales para crear una oportunidad para aquellos que no la tienen, para esparcir la información que un tema así requiere.
¡El documental trata acerca de la fuerza de la gente que diariamente enfrenta el dilema y la lucha diaria de perder a sus seres queridos bajo circunstancias misteriosas donde sus derechos humanos fueron violentados sin cesar! El caso analizado y documentado es la historia de Marta Escobar.
Este documental está basado en una historia real y tiene como propósito mostrar la fortaleza del ser humano cuando atraviesa este tipo de circunstancias.
 

 
¿Quién no entiende el sufrimiento, agonía y dolor cuando un ser amado desaparece de pronto?
Si ese fuese el caso de un amigo, pareja o un miembro de la familia, el shock y la agonía mental para enfrentar una situación así sería una lucha insoportable, insuperable, que mucha gente puede imaginar pero solo aquellos que lo han experimentado conocen la realidad. El dolor y el sufrimiento es mayor cuando los miembros de la familia del desaparecido no tienen el derecho de estar de luto por su ser querido. Al contrario, ellos son forzados a vivir en la esperanza constante de tener nuevas pistas y respuestas que puedan llevarlos a conseguir explicaciones válidas o entender que es lo que verdaderamente sucedió.
Ahora, intenta imaginar si algo tan terrible te pasaría a ti! Que alguien muy cercano y muy amado de pronto un día desaparece.
La muerte es más aceptable, y llega un punto en el tiempo que te permite estar de luto, entender y aceptar la realidad. Sin embargo, ¿podrías tener paz contigo mismo si tú no sabes las circunstancias bajo las cuales tu ser amado desapareció sin ningún rastro o ninguna razón comprensible?
¿Qué es lo que tú harías sin una sola pista? Más aún, cómo te sentirías sin poder alguno para investigar? ¿Cómo aceptarías que alguien está muerto cuando tú no tienes la certeza? ¿Podrías virar la página y continuar con tu vida bajo estas circunstancias?
Si tú aún estás leyendo esto, talvez nosotras tocamos tu corazón y tú entiendes que bajo ciertas circunstancias nosotros tendríamos los mismos sentimientos de frustración, ira e intranquilidad. Pero nosotros sabemos que tú lucharías y que no pararías de buscar. Esas exactamente fueron las circunstancias para Marta Escobar, ella no se rinde y aún continúa luchando por más de 27 años junto con muchos otros.
El propósito de este documental no está enfocado en los desaparecidos, pero busca entender la psicología de aquellos que buscan por respuestas. Para sentir su dolor y frustración enfrentando esta terrible realidad. Para adoptar su fuerza y su determinación para entender qué pasó con sus seres queridos y con sus continuos e interminables esfuerzos para alcanzar el éxito sin darse por vencidos.
El propósito de este documental es experimentar con estas personas las condiciones psicológicas y prácticas de la lucha diaria por encontrar pistas. Nosotras queremos apoyar su coraje y su resistencia y asegurar que ellos no se sientan solos en su incansable e interminable búsqueda por ‘aquellos que un día estuvieron presentes y fueron visibles y al siguiente día se volvieron invisibles’
Tú puedes hacer esto posible, y una contribución pequeña de todos ustedes nos permitirá dar la fuerza de nuestra voz combinada para estas personas.
Cada pequeña donación es vital y un paso adelante para apoyar a estas personas. Cada vez que tú compartes esto en una red social o discutes esto con alguien, tú te vuelves parte de nuestro grupo: ¡esto es correcto! ¡Tú serás parte de aquellos que pueden hacer la diferencia!
¡Haz la diferencia con una pequeña donación! Date la oportunidad de crear un efecto dominó.
Nosotras verdaderamente, apasionadamente queremos hacer esta película. Estamos tan apasionadas que nosotras estamos listas y dispuestas a vivir a pan y agua si es necesario por finalizar este proyecto!
Los 17.000 USD que colocamos como meta es el mínimo que necesitamos alcanzar para la realización de este documental en Ecuador. Menos de esto, significa que no sería posible ir. 
Cómo te gustaría aportar en esta apasionada aventura para dar voz a aquellos que están buscando a tientas en la oscuridad para buscar a sus seres amados, pero en vano, en el tecnológicamente avanzado siglo 21?
Envíanos a Ecuador y nosotros te diremos todo acerca de estas personas que necesitan ser escuchadas.
¡Gracias!

(IN)Visible é um documentario inspirador sobre as familias de pessoas desaparecidas que nao desistem de buscar por pistas e rastros. O projeto do filme italiano foi pesquisado, investigado, produzido e dirigido por Alice Montorselli.
O desejo ardente de dar voz a aqueles que nao tem uma foi o que impulsionou ela a utilizar de seu artificios como profissinais do audio-visual para criar uma oportunidade para contarem e compartilharem informacoes sobre o que se passa por tras de tal tema.
O objetivo do documentario é narrar a força das pessoas que se encontram na luta do dia-dia para afrontar os dilemas e as causas da perda de seus entes queridos em circunstancias misteriosas, onde os direitos humanos foram violados! O caso analisado e documentado é a historia de Martha Escobar.
Se trata de um documentario baseado em uma historia real, onde demonstra como o ser humano é capaz de criar forças mesmo estando sob tais cirscunstancias.
 
                                    A HISTORIA
 
Quem de nos nao seria capaz de entender a sofrencia, a agonia e a dor da perda de uma pessoa amada?
Seja essa uma pessoa da familia, um amigo querido, um amor. O choque e a tormenta de tal situacao, representa um esforco temendo e imensuravel, que muitos podem imaginar, mas somente alguns vivem e coomprendem a realidade.
A dor e a sofrencia sao maiores quando os familiares da pessoa desaparecida nao possuem ao menos o direito de luto, de lamentar a perda repentina de seu ente querido; invez disso, sao obrigadas a viver com a constante esperança de achar novos indicios ou respostas, que possam dar a elas uma vàlida explicaçao ou coomprensao do que realmente aconteceu.
Agora, tente imaginar se uma coisa terrivel dessas acontecesse com voce! Que qualquer um, muito proximo e querido, de repente, de um dia para o outro, desaparecesse!
A morte é mais facil de aceitar e se se tem ao menos o direito de lamentar, entender e aceitar os fatos. É impossivel conseguir ficar em paz com voce mesmo se nao tiver ao menos o conhecimento ou a condicao na qual um ente querido é dado como desaparecido; sem deixar rastros ou um motivo no minimo coompreensivel.
O que faria se se encontrasse sem algum indicio? Ou até, come se sentiria sem alguma possibilidade de fazer uma investigacao? Como poderia aceitar a morte de qualquer um se nao tivesse a absoluta certeza que de fato é morto? Seria capaz de virar a pagina e continuar a sua vida sob tal situacao?
Pravavelmente nao.
Se voce ainda esta lendo, talvez tenhamos tocado o seu coracao e entende que todos nos, sob tais circunstacias, teriamos os mesmos sentimentos de raiva, frustacao, inquietude. Estamos certos que continuaria a lutar e a nao iria parar de procurar e buscar por pistas. Essas sao as condicoes que se encontra Martha Escobar: ela nao ainda nao desistiu e ainda esta lutando, mesmo apos 27 anos, junto com muitos outros.
O objetivo desse documentario nao é se concentrar nas pessoas desaparecidas, mas sim naquelas que ficam e estudar a sua psique que estao a procura de respostas. De sentir a dor e a frustacao dessa terrivel realidade. De abracar a sua forca e a sua determinacao de entender o que aconteceu a seus entes queridos e o esforco continuo para alcancar a verdade, sem desistir.
Esse documentario mostra a vivencia com essas pessoas, a condicao psicologica e pratica na qual se encontram durante a luta cotidiana atras de qualquer tracos ou rastros que os desaparecidos possam ter deixado. Queremos apoiar a sua coragem e a sua resistencia. Queremos assegurar que nao se sintam sozinhas na sua incansavel e incessante busca daqueles que um dia ja foram presentes e visivies e que no dia seguinte se tornam invisiveis.
Voce pode fazer tudo isso possivel; uma pequena contribuicao de todos voces permitirà a doar a essas pessoas a forca de nossas vozes juntas!
Cada pequena doacao é vital e representa un passo a frente para apoiar essas pessoas.
A cada vez que compartilhar essa campanha em uma rede social ou comentar com alguem, estara fazendo parte da nossa equipe. É isso ai! Voce farà parte daqueles que podem fazer a diferença!
Faça a diferenca com uma pequena doaçao. Agarrem a oportunidade de começar uma reacao em cadeia.
Desejamos veramente, ardentemente, apaixonadamente, fazer esse filme. Tanto que estamos dispostas a irviver somente de pao e agua todos os dias para fazer isso possivel. Viva um dia como nos! Vale a pena :)
piadas a parte, os 17,000 USD (15.000€), que estamos como objetivo, é a quantia minima que devemos juntar para poder realizar o documentario no Equador. Menos que isso, significa nao poder realizar o filme.
Como voce gostaria de apoiar a nossa apaixonante emboscada para dar voz aqueles que vagam no escuro em busca de seus amados perdidos?
Nos permita viajar ao Equador e te contaremos tudo sobre essas pessoas, que precisam ser escutadas

We are bringing global awareness to this issue in order to show others how to protect their human rights and create a better world.<br/><br/><b>The Synopsis:</b><br/><i>30,000 Litres</i> is a full-length documentary about water privatization in Ireland and the human rights movement being led by Irish citizens.<br/><br/>While the United Nations states that every human needs 36,500 litres of water every year just to survive, the Irish government has put new restrictions on water usage, allowing each Irish household access to a free allowance of 30,000 litres of water for the year. After that usage cap is reached, residents face direct charges.<br/><br/>With these restrictions, whispers of scandal have also been echoing throughout the country. Money that was supposed to go towards Ireland’s decaying water infrastructure is unaccounted for, tax dollars from citizens seem to have disappeared, and Irish Water, the company that now manages Ireland’s water infrastructure, has already come under fire for profligate spending of taxpayer money.<br/><br/>Using the human right to water, the Irish have mobilized in a new revolution to stop the endless austerity measures their country has been enduring since the EU bailout. Community organizations, trade unions, and political parties have united to establish the Policy Principles for a Progressive Irish Government (a human rights manifesto). This document addresses 10 human rights claims, including water. The proposal was released to every Irish citizen to amend and will now be the platform of a coming Town Hall Tour in September  2015.<br/><br/><i>30,000 Litres</i> is a story of social change and will provide living examples of how activism can work outside of politics. The human rights manifesto hitting the streets of Ireland next month will provide a lasting story of how people can work together to overcome injustice. This documentary will also expand outside of Ireland’s borders, shining light on the solidarity movement happening in Greece, the empowering work that’s being done by the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) in the U.S., and a trip to meet with the Detroit Water Brigade (whose members have helped in Ireland's fight against privatizing this precious resource).<br/><br/>With media blackouts and corruption in Ireland seeming to be on the rise, <i>30,000 Litres</i> helps give these activists a conduit to share their story and provides a model of how positive activism can be implemented locally and globally.

With the production growing bigger and bigger each year we need all of your help to bring the bible to life!  Together with your gift, we can help fulfill the great commission of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is your opportunity to share in advancing the Kingdom of God in an up close and personal way. Thank you in advance for helping us share the greatest stories ever told in a way that will never be forgotten.
As the Apostle Paul told those who gave financial gifts to help him share the gospel, we say to you, ""This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.

As many as 300,000 Veterans will go homeless or
in a shelter on any given night.  </p>
<p>• 
A majority of the civilian population does not
know or understand the issues that are facing Veterans as they return from
combat trying to reintegrate into society. </p>

have been put in place, the ability for civilians to understand the issues are
extremely limited, which lead to further isolation and a larger gap between

<p>Easily put, we want the
people who live this life on a daily basis to share their stories and we want
to get as many people as possible to listen and truly understand the realities
of what they deal with. Our approach is to do “no holds barred”interviews with
Combat Veterans, their families, therapists who specialize in combat PTSD, and
the families of those Veterans who made the ultimate decision to end their
life. The plan is to do this with a feature length documentary, followed by a
recurring web series with in-depth interviews and real life stories. We will
discuss the realities of what our Veterans go through in combat, how these
events will affect them and their families, why it affects them this way, and
what we can do to help. For so long these issues have been off limits and there
have been rules around what can or cannot be discussed. It is our belief that
an open discussion about these issues is the only way to really start finding

<p>We
decided a long time ago that we were going to do this no matter what. If it
meant that we had to do it with no money, in our spare time, with a cheap
camera, we were going to do it, simply because it may help a single person.
That said, the more money we can raise, the better job we can do and the better
the film is, the more people who will watch and the better chance we have of
reaching someone who may need to hear our message. I promise you, we are not in
this to line our own pockets! Everyone working on this project has a full time
job and is able to support themselves and their families. However, much of the
outside support we need is from people who are trying to make a living. We've solidified a partnership with a production company to direct, shoot, and edit the film. This is something we cannot afford anymore ourselves if we want to do it right. Things like camera rentals, lights and audio equipment, studio time, post-production services, etc. can be very expensive on a feature length documentary. When we need a song, or marketing documents, or legal advice, or
something along those lines, we need to pay for it. To date, we have done that
with our own money, but we aren’t rich and this isn’t sustainable. </p>
<p>Another
large, but important cost is travel. For instance, we have a woman right now,
who lost her son to suicide after combat tours. The story of her son and the
pieces he left behind are heartbreaking and powerful and it is a story that
needs to be told! It needs to be told, so another Veteran who may be
contemplating suicide can see that damage it leaves behind! So they can see
that they aren’t alone in their feelings, but that there is a better way.
Unfortunately, she does not live close by, so this involves a film crew
traveling to her. With car rentals, hotels, meals, and other travel expenses it can get very expensive.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
math is simple. If we raise no money, we will do what we can locally with what
we have. If we raise a thousand dollars, maybe we can do a little more. If we
raise $20K, we can make something decent and worth watching. If we raise $100K,
we can make a quality movie that will do this cause justice and reach a much,
much larger audience and hopefully help that many more people with their daily
struggle!</span></p>

Spread Awareness!
As we moved forward with this project, we realized how many people just

problem, unless people are aware there is a problem.


Let Veterans who may be struggling, or feeling weak because of their

normal after what they’ve seen and done.
One of the most common reasons we’ve encountered in Combat Veterans
with suicidal thoughts has been the feeling of isolation, or that they are

struggling and broken, while the people they served with seem fine on the

Show Veterans and the Civilian population that Combat PTSD affects many
people from all walks of life and that Combat PTSD does not need to define you.

We’ve met Veterans dealing with Combat PTSD who are doctors, lawyers,
fathers, mothers, police officers, college students, professors, and just about
anything else you can think of! PTSD does NOT define who you are, or what you
are able to do in life. 


Inform the civilian population of the realities of combat PTSD and let
them know that contrary to the current opinions, Veterans with Combat PTSD are

This perception is not only false, but it makes it difficult for
Veterans to find jobs, maintain relationships and build a supportive social

Give family members and friends a glimpse of what is going on and why

Misunderstandings and a Veterans inability to share these feelings or
reactions often lead to distance in between friends and family members. This
can lead to isolation, divorce and a deeper depression over the issue. 


Let Veterans know that it is okay to reach out for help! 
Anyone who joined the military is by nature an independent person. A

they need help, it is uncomfortable for them. We want to promote the feeling
that it is alright to reach out for help and at the same time remove the victim

They draw back when they learn of the deed he has done to keep them safe.

But when an earthquake hits the island, a massive tsunami follows, dragging the undead out to sea and washing them up on Santa Monica beach. Shockwaves from the island earthquake start creating a ripple effect which causes more devastating tsunami action in L.A., thus washing ashore more hoards of the undead.

</div></div>","The Story: Zombie Tsunami begins on a secret military island that the general public knows nothing about; this is where experiments are being conducted to create super soldiers of the undead, which the U.S. government plans to deploy to North Korea in an effort to overthrow Kim Jong-un and free the oppressed citizens. But when an earthquake hits the island, a massive tsunami follows, dragging the undead out to sea and washing them up on Santa Monica beach. Shockwaves from the island earthquake start creating a ripple effect which causes more devastating tsunami action in L.A., thus washing ashore more hoards of the undead. The first to go are the surfers who were stoked on the big surf. Next, the drunk bums on the beach because they assume the zombies are their own kind due to their atrocious odor and uneasy gait.

need your support in order to provide legal and legislative assistance to the
Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Nations as they combat the exploitation of their
Tribal youth. </b></h4><blockquote>On Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, Native children--some as young as nine--are being used for sex trafficking in the “man camps” of transient worker populations lured to the region because of lucrative jobs in fracking. </blockquote>
<h3><b>THE
ISSUE</b></h3>
<p>Native
children on Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana are being exploited through sex trafficking in record
numbers.  While many people understand
sex trafficking to be a largely international issue, involving kidnapping and urban
sex rings with foreign national workers, many Native minors are currently being
prostituted by adults nationwide, and the problem has grown particularly bad
for Fort Peck.  In an area of North
Dakota a few miles to the East of Fort Peck, known as “the Bakken,” a
catastrophic Wild West has emerged.  Young men are swarming
the region in astonishing numbers because of the promise of lucrative jobs in fracking. Fort Peck has seen an
unprecedented surge of violent crime and sex and drug trafficking, overwhelming the already extremely limited law enforcement resources in the area.</p>
<p>Fort
Peck’s Native children—some as young as nine--are being used in the “man camps”
of transient Bakken worker populations. 
Young people are recruited from powwows and local convenience stores.  Child brothels operate out of trailers on the
Reservation.  The tribes do not have a
law enforcement, prosecutorial, or victim services framework to handle this
sharply escalating problem.  Notably,
they also lack a tribal code provision that criminalizes child trafficking and therefore
lack ability to call attention to the problem, educate law enforcement, and
identify victims.</p><h3>BACKGROUND ON FORT PECK</h3><p></p><p>600 miles east of the well-traveled majesty of Glacier National Park, the mountains give way to a generous spread of badlands and plains, and empty into a place that, it seems, time has forgotten. The Fort Peck Reservation is home of Montana’s oldest rodeo and the Assiniboine and Sioux Indian Nations. </p><p>Fort Peck is as remote as any inhabited region of the United States.  The landscape stretches out endlessly under the bright glare of open and unrelenting skies, with small dusty homesteads and trailers dotting the landscape.  While beautiful, especially amid the sacred badlands at sunset, or along the wild and unpopulated Missouri River Breaks, this is a very difficult place in which to exist.  The Fort Peck Tribal community endures crippling poverty; 50% of children live below the poverty line, and access to all human services is acutely limited.  Young people on the Reservation experience all of the accepted ""vulnerability factors"" for trafficking, including a high rate of child welfare system involvement and extraordinary rates of substance abuse, mental illness, and PTSD.</p>
<p></p><h3><b>THE IMPACT </b></h3><p>Your support can help us provide legal and legislative assistance to the youth, community organizations, and Tribal Government working to fight trafficking.</p><p>We will travel to Fort Peck to interview victims, advocates, and community members, and work with them to develop solutions.

<p>Après une petite enfance chaotique, Mélanie pense avoir enfin trouvé une
famille stable auprès de ses parents adoptifs. Mais soudain à l’âge de 16 ans ses
cauchemars d’enfance reviennent la hanter. Une menace pèse sur ce fragile
équilibre. Tirée de force du cocon douillet de l'enfance, Mélanie sera obligée
de faire face à un monde hostile. Elle partira à la recherche de son père afin
de prouver son innocence et tentera de sauver sa famille. Pour y arriver, elle
devra surmonter d'innombrables obstacles et, en premier lieu, Pascal, l'amant

traumatisme vécu auprès de ses parents naturels, des toxicos accros à l’héroïne.
Mais ce sont aussi les cauchemars que vivent ses deux
parents adoptifs. Les arcs-en-ciel font référence au proverbe amérindien : « L’âme n’aurait pas d’arc-en-ciel si les
yeux n’avaient pas de larmes ». En substance, c'est en affrontant les épreuves, 
quitte à en
subir les conséquences, que se révèle notre vraie force de caractère. Pourquoi un proverbe amérindien ? Parce que pour
surmonter l’adversité, Mélanie sera épaulée par son mentor et principale
alliée, son amie Nakoma qui se vit comme la réincarnation d’une guerrière
amérindienne.<p><br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442241983/rkbues3awgvg8fbref25.png"" src="""" style=""""/> Car ce film a pour ambition de porter un message d’espoir et d’optimisme.
Mélanie aurait facilement pu succomber à l’accablement, jeter l’éponge, rentrer
dans sa coquille et refuser d’en sortir. Mais elle fait preuve d’un esprit
indomptable et refuse la fatalité en gardant foi en son père malgré toutes les
apparences.<br/><br/><p>Car il s’agit de montrer l’importance des valeurs essentielles que sont
le courage, l’amour et la confiance en autrui et comment ces valeurs peuvent
surmonter et vaincre le cynisme, l’égoïsme et le désespoir. Cette histoire met
également en scène les faiblesses des êtres humains, la lâcheté, la convoitise,
la peur d’agir, le désir de pouvoir et de domination, l’abandon de l’autre pour
laisser libre cours à ses propres addictions sexuelles ou toxicologiques.</p>
<p>Car nous allons assister au combat de Mélanie à travers des scènes fortes et
dramatiques décrivant les relations et les conflits entre les personnages :
Nakoma et Mélanie sur la montagne sacrée ; Pascal qui, en colère, révèle à
Mélanie la vérité sur ses parents naturels ; l’effondrement de la relation
entre Mélanie et sa mère rendue impossible par la présence de Pascal ; la plongée
de Mélanie dans le monde de la prostitution parisienne à la recherche de son
père et surtout le dénouement final sur les bords de Seine...</p>
<p>Car s’il y a des larmes, il y a aussi des rires. Comment pourrait-il en
être autrement lorsque l’on veut célébrer l’esprit humain ? La relation
Nakoma - Mélanie est remplie de moments de joie, quand Nakoma tire Mélanie du
lit à 7 heures du matin pour aller faire une cérémonie amérindienne sur la montagne
sacrée. Une montagne sacrée à Ivry-sur-Seine ? Eh bien oui. Nakoma la
trouvera ! Ou quand elles arrivent à hacker le mail de Pascal, quand
Stéphane et Raymond se font racketter au bord de la Seine par une bande de
voyous très atypiques... Ces scènes apportent de la légèreté au film, ce qui a
pour effet de renforcer le message central tout en générant de l’empathie pour
les personnages, un atout essentiel pour toute histoire réussie.</p>
<p>J’aime profondément tous les personnages de cette histoire, avec leur
bagage et leur passé, leurs faiblesses et leurs forces, les relations et les
conflits qui les animent et leur évolution au fil de l’histoire.</p>

had a chaotic childhood but thinks she has finally found a stable family with

Mélanie will be pulled by force out of the cosy cocoon of childhood and obliged

nightmares are firstly the nightmares Mélanie had as a very young child
traumatised by the experience she had with her natural parents, both heroin
drug addicts. But there are also the nightmares that both her adopted parents
go through. The rainbows come from the American indian proverb which goes “The
soul would have no rainbow if the eyes had no tears”. In other words it is by
facing the difficulties and injustices of life straight that shows how truely
courageous we are, however painful the consequences. Why an American indian
proverb? Because throughout this entire adventure, Mélanie’s mentor and guide
is her best friend Nakoma and Nakoma believes herself to be the reincarnation
of an American indian warrior.<p><br/></p>

<p>Because the ambition of this film is to carry a message of
hope and optimism. Mélanie could easily have given in to despair, thrown in the
sponge, crawled into her shell never to come out again. But this film shows us
an indomptable spirit who refuses to lie down and who keeps the faith in her
father despite all the appearances.</p>
<p>Because this film
wants to show the importance of such essential values as courage, love and
trust in others and how these values can overcome cynicism, egoism and despair.
But this story also shows our weaknesses, our cowardice, greed, fear of acting,
desire for power and domination, abandoning of others to give in to
toxicological or sexual addictions.</p>
<p>Because we will
follow Mélanie’s struggle through strong and dramatic scenes where we see the

Ce teaser vous permet d'apprécier le potentiel du film. Pour le visionner cliquez ci-dessous.



Après une petite enfance chaotique, Mélanie pense avoir enfin trouvé une
famille stable auprès de ses parents adoptifs. Mais soudain à l’âge de 16 ans ses
cauchemars d’enfance reviennent la hanter. Une menace pèse sur ce fragile
équilibre. Tirée de force du cocon douillet de l'enfance, Mélanie sera obligée
de faire face à un monde hostile. Elle partira à la recherche de son père afin
de prouver son innocence et tentera de sauver sa famille. Pour y arriver, elle
devra surmonter d'innombrables obstacles et, en premier lieu, Pascal, l'amant
de sa mère…






Les cauchemars ce sont d’abord ceux de Mélanie très jeune, suite au
traumatisme vécu auprès de ses parents naturels, des toxicos accros à l’héroïne.
Mais ce sont aussi les cauchemars que vivent ses deux
parents adoptifs. Les arcs-en-ciel font référence au proverbe amérindien : « L’âme n’aurait pas d’arc-en-ciel si les
yeux n’avaient pas de larmes ». En substance, c'est en affrontant les épreuves, 
quitte à en
subir les conséquences, que se révèle notre vraie force de caractère. Pourquoi un proverbe amérindien ? Parce que pour
surmonter l’adversité, Mélanie sera épaulée par son mentor et principale
alliée, son amie Nakoma qui se vit comme la réincarnation d’une guerrière
amérindienne.
 Car ce film a pour ambition de porter un message d’espoir et d’optimisme.
Mélanie aurait facilement pu succomber à l’accablement, jeter l’éponge, rentrer
dans sa coquille et refuser d’en sortir. Mais elle fait preuve d’un esprit
indomptable et refuse la fatalité en gardant foi en son père malgré toutes les
apparences.Car il s’agit de montrer l’importance des valeurs essentielles que sont
le courage, l’amour et la confiance en autrui et comment ces valeurs peuvent
surmonter et vaincre le cynisme, l’égoïsme et le désespoir. Cette histoire met
également en scène les faiblesses des êtres humains, la lâcheté, la convoitise,
la peur d’agir, le désir de pouvoir et de domination, l’abandon de l’autre pour
laisser libre cours à ses propres addictions sexuelles ou toxicologiques.
Car nous allons assister au combat de Mélanie à travers des scènes fortes et
dramatiques décrivant les relations et les conflits entre les personnages :
Nakoma et Mélanie sur la montagne sacrée ; Pascal qui, en colère, révèle à
Mélanie la vérité sur ses parents naturels ; l’effondrement de la relation
entre Mélanie et sa mère rendue impossible par la présence de Pascal ; la plongée
de Mélanie dans le monde de la prostitution parisienne à la recherche de son
père et surtout le dénouement final sur les bords de Seine...
Car s’il y a des larmes, il y a aussi des rires. Comment pourrait-il en
être autrement lorsque l’on veut célébrer l’esprit humain ? La relation
Nakoma - Mélanie est remplie de moments de joie, quand Nakoma tire Mélanie du
lit à 7 heures du matin pour aller faire une cérémonie amérindienne sur la montagne
sacrée. Une montagne sacrée à Ivry-sur-Seine ? Eh bien oui. Nakoma la
trouvera ! Ou quand elles arrivent à hacker le mail de Pascal, quand
Stéphane et Raymond se font racketter au bord de la Seine par une bande de
voyous très atypiques... Ces scènes apportent de la légèreté au film, ce qui a
pour effet de renforcer le message central tout en générant de l’empathie pour
les personnages, un atout essentiel pour toute histoire réussie.
J’aime profondément tous les personnages de cette histoire, avec leur
bagage et leur passé, leurs faiblesses et leurs forces, les relations et les
conflits qui les animent et leur évolution au fil de l’histoire.

Sur notre site web, vous pouvez suivre l’aventure de ce film et accéder
à une foule d'infos, photos, etc. ainsi qu’au teaser que nous avons déjà tourné,

en mère piégée et percluse de culpabilité, Mickaël qui incarnera le père
adoptif, un rôle d’introspection difficile, Alex aux yeux d’acier qui sied si
bien au personnage de Pascal et enfin Céline qui donnera vie à Nakoma, l’amie
de Mélanie.Nous espérons tourner très bientôt. Votre soutien est essentiel pour
faire de ce film un succès. Pour nous aider, vous pouvez soit faire une contribution sans contrepartie soit cliquer sur l’une des récompenses proposées,

 Nightmares and Rainbows - English Campaign
A
thriller in the form of a family drama pitching a teenage girl against a
predator determined to destroy her family. See the pitch in English below. 

We shot a teaser to show people the potential of this film. The version of the teaser below has subtitles in English.

Mélanie
had a chaotic childhood but thinks she has finally found a stable family with
her adopted parents. But now at the age of 16 the nightmares she had when she was
a young child come back to haunt her. Her new family is now also under threat.
Mélanie will be pulled by force out of the cosy cocoon of childhood and obliged
to confront a hostile world. She has to find her father and prove his innocence
to save her family. To do this she must overcome numerous obstacles not the
least of which is Pascal, her mother’s lover…
The
nightmares are firstly the nightmares Mélanie had as a very young child
traumatised by the experience she had with her natural parents, both heroin
drug addicts. But there are also the nightmares that both her adopted parents
go through. The rainbows come from the American indian proverb which goes “The
soul would have no rainbow if the eyes had no tears”. In other words it is by
facing the difficulties and injustices of life straight that shows how truely
courageous we are, however painful the consequences. Why an American indian
proverb? Because throughout this entire adventure, Mélanie’s mentor and guide
is her best friend Nakoma and Nakoma believes herself to be the reincarnation
of an American indian warrior.


Because the ambition of this film is to carry a message of
hope and optimism. Mélanie could easily have given in to despair, thrown in the
sponge, crawled into her shell never to come out again. But this film shows us
an indomptable spirit who refuses to lie down and who keeps the faith in her
father despite all the appearances.
Because this film
wants to show the importance of such essential values as courage, love and
trust in others and how these values can overcome cynicism, egoism and despair.
But this story also shows our weaknesses, our cowardice, greed, fear of acting,
desire for power and domination, abandoning of others to give in to
toxicological or sexual addictions.
Because we will
follow Mélanie’s struggle through strong and dramatic scenes where we see the
relationships and conflicts between the characters unfold: Nakoma and Mélanie on
the sacred mountain; Pascal who angrily reveals to Mélanie the truth about her
natural parents; the collapse of the relationship between Mélanie and her
mother made impossible by the presence of Pascal; Mélanie’s plunge into the
world of Parisian prostitution in search of her father and especially the
dramatic climax at the edge of the Seine river when Stéphane is about to put an
end to his life.
Because while
there are tears there are also smiles. How could it be otherwise when you want
to celebrate the human spirit? Nakoma and Mélanie’s relationship is full of
moments of joy, when Nakoma drags Mélanie out of bed at 7 am to go up to the
sacred mountain to carry out an indian ceremony. A sacred mountain in
Ivry-sur-Seine ? Yes indeed. Nakoma will find one! Or when they manage to
hack Pascal’s email account or when Stéphane and Raymond are racketed down by
the Seine river by a very unsual gang of thugs. These scenes bring a light
touch to the film and this has the effect of strenthening its core message while
generating empathy for the characters, an essential part of any good story.

I
deeply love all these characters, with their foibles and backstory, their
strengths and weaknesses, their relationships and conflicts between each other
and the way they change over the course of the story.

This campaign will become one-stop platform for people who don't get the right kind of exposure in the media I have already experimented on its future track. Presently, it is getting 30,000 unique visitors with more than 100,000 page views per month. It has fantastic bounce rate of 8%, which is far-far lower than what the industry usually gets. The traffic the platform gets is from around 170 countries.",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<div>""Indomitable"" follows Danielle Wilkes (Amber DeVos), a former soldier and wounded warrior who now runs a company that helps women veterans with their transition into civilian life. Her life is, suddenly, turned upside down when her former boyfriend, Nathan Lewis (D James Jones), comes back into her life.  Meanwhile, trouble follows Nathan after he was hired to investigate the co-owner of security contractor suspected of breaking international laws.

</p><p><b>Film Overview</b></p>
<p>In a long awaited bid to rebuild the empty relationship with his daughter that he left for dead, skilled criminal, JONATHAN's dangerous past comes back to hinder any chance of reviving their bond. Will his return to the city to be re-united with his daughter EMILIA be worth it? His previous attempt at getting out of the organized crime of New York City, resulted in the loss of his wife CLAIRE and the near death of EMILIA, so will he be able to re-connect with his daughter? Will he seek revenge on the man who drove him to the bad decisions he made in his past? Or should he have stayed away?</p>
<p>Opening with a flashback scene of the car crash that resulted in the tragedy of the family, the film then follows JONATHAN's return to the city upon his discovery that his daughter is still alive. His dangerous past now interferes with the life of an innocent young girl, who was unaware that her father was even still alive. The destiny of everyone is lying in the hands of a man that was gone, but never forgotten.</p>
<p><b>JONATHAN:</b> <b><i>(TBC)</i></b><br/>Jonathan, Father to Emilia (18), so he is in his 40's. Ex criminal, involved in organized crime, used to work for Alexander, before stealing money from him and leaving town. Tall (6ft+), athletic build, a good person at heart but with the skills to match the bad people around. He is attempting to rebuild his relationship with his daughter that he (accidentally) left for dead 14 years earlier. A strong character with a dark past.</p>
<p><b>EMILIA:</b> <b><i>(Vitória Mattos)</i></b><br/>Emilia, daughter to Jonathan, 18 years old, a girl who has been brought up by a foreign family after losing her mother in a car crash, and under the impression that her father had passed also. </p>
<p>She is a good looking young girl, with a strong personality and an independent attitude. She is hard working and committed to creating a good life for herself, on her own.</p><p><b>ALEXANDER: <i>(TBC)</i><br/></b>Alexander, head of the organized crime family, the Richardson's. He runs the crime circles of Manhattan. Father to Christian (28) and Luka (25). Very powerful and intimidating man, with manipulative skills. Intelligent, borderline sadistic, without any real morals. </p>
<p><b>VICTOR: <i>(TBC)</i><br/></b>Victor, early 50's, old friend and confidant of Jonathan. Bar owner, friendly and kind. Used to work for Alexander, but got out as he got older and wiser. Again, has a very good heart but with the skills to match the bad people around. Has an extremely kind face and positive energy throughout.</p>
<p><b>CHRISTIAN:</b> <b><i>(Will Parker)</i></b><br/>Christian, son of Alexander, 28 years old, extremely loyal to his father, and is practically his fathers right hand man. He is quiet and confident, with a serious amount of ambition.</p>
<p><b>LUKA:</b> <b><i>(Max Turner)</i></b><br/>Luka, son of Alexander, 25 years old, is also extremely loyal to his father. He is more of an extrovert, with a limited vocabulary and vulgar mouth. Not as intelligent as his brother, and still immature with a lack of understanding of the serious business he's involved in.</p>
<p><b>ANDRE 'GUNS' JOHNSON:</b> <b><i>(Nić Hamilton)</i></b><br/>Guns, good friend of the brothers Christian and Luka. Keeps an eye on Victor for Alexander in the hope of discovering any people that are going against his family.</p>
<p><b>Cheyenne Pasquer - Director</b></p>
<p>I am a 21 year old Director in New York City. I was born in France but raised in Germany, before moving to the Big Apple in 2014. I always wanted to be a Filmmaker due to my fascination of the different styles and genres that can be explored through a visual medium. One of my main inspirations is David Fincher with his dark films and intense visuals. Throughout my work on 41 Films from PA to Director, I started to create my own style and an acute level of professionalism. I have studied filmmaking at the New York Film Academy and have learnt many different techniques and learnt about the industry. </p>
<p>I created the concept and story of this film starting with the relationship of a Father and his Daughter. I then developed the story to introduce conflict, struggle and deep emotion combined with suspense, action and drama. With the help of my screenwriter, we have developed a screenplay that is captivating for an audience and also relatable and real, which allows me to be experimental with the visuals in modern and exciting ways. This film will be a huge platform for future success in the industry. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438972247/f0ooj9ww2daagayj34fv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

We have developed a great working and personal relationship which enables us to combine our skills and visions, to create innovative and modern work. Working with Cheyenne this year to develop this intense and dramatic story has been both fun and challenging. However, after continuously fine tuning to ensure a full story with deep and real characters, living in a world that is not out of the ordinary, we have managed to create a visually captivating and emotional journey for the audience to join us on.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438972405/trpw7soktbp6tamlrksp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>Although this is a large amount of money, we are committed to spending every waking hour in developing the project. The risks we are going to come up against are securing every location within the specified 1 week that we have to film the project. We have commitments with actors and members of the crew that can always change, but we will be drawing up agreements to ensure that we will have a full cast and crew on board for the week of principle photography. Weather can always be an issue too, but we have ensured that we balance interior and exterior locations.

Wardrobe also costs money and a lot of these girls don't normally dress up in the pin-up style we feature, so we go out and get them outfits on our own.
The photography and design is something we do in house but there are hard costs there as well that we'd like to cover. 

Then there's the actual printing. We print locally on American presses to once again contribute to the local economy and showcase local businesses. The printing is high quality and so is the paper.
 With your contributions, we can cover these costs.

MONEY, HONEY
We're doing something a little different with this campaign in that we're only raising the funds necessary to produce the second episode, as well as what we'll need to  get the word out. (Festival submissions and promotion costs some major coin, hunties.) 
The idea is to launch a campaign before we shoot each episode. This way, we can adjust costs according to the needs of each individual episode and only need to raise a relatively small sum each time! We think it's kinda brilliant.
Life's a Drag is a long form web series, basically meaning each episode is the length of a traditional TV show at around 25 minutes and in order to maintain the high quality standards set by our pilot episode, we have to cough up some dough. Apparently cast and crew need things like food and shelter, whodathunk? 
For all that to happen, we need YOU! You and your incredibly generous contributions! I mean, we literally can't do it without you...literally.
Here's how it all breaks down...


Lets start with the big stuff....
Festivals and Promotion: Now we know that's a whole lotta purple, but just think about it. The average film and television show, even web shows (the best known ones, anyway) have invested a HUGE share of their budget into marketing (those billboards and commericals ain't cheap, honey). Now we're not saying that we're ready to buy billboard space quite yet (season 2?), we're still too small of a production for that, but we can do the next best thing. FESTIVALS!
The festival circuit is an incredible place to showcase fresh material and build our critical base. A bigger base means more interest, more interest means more money, and more money means a better show!  Festival submission fees can (and do) quickly add up, plus there's the cost of additional promotion (We have an awesome publicist) it's best to raise a good amount and whatever you can save, we just put right back into production costs for the next episode...told ya, freakin' brilliant. We've already started this process and have already received some critical buzz! (3 nominations? We fancy, huh?)
Food/Misc: Now into production. Everyone in the cast and crew is taking significant (like, significant) pay cuts in order to be a part of this crazy little ride. The way we see it, if we can't pay you what you're worth, we can at least feed you well. If we're gonna ask everyone to work for peanuts, we need to make sure they're at least getting some tasty nuts. (Yes, pun totally intended)
Locations: As the story progresses, we want to make sure we open the world up and take advantage of all the diverse and beautiful places available to us in Los Angeles. It's weird, but for some reason people generally charge for their beautiful places. Craziness.
Cast and Crew: Finally, the meat and potatoes of our operation. Almost everyone worked for free putting together our pilot episode, and this time around we wanted to be able to scrape something together for all their hard work and immense talent. No one is getting rich (yet) by any stretch of the imagination. But gas money goes a long way when you're asking people to drive through LA traffic to work for tasty, tasty peanuts out in Calabassas.
Oh, and speaking of Cast and Crew...

Life’s a Drag is an opportunity to tell stories about people we don’t often see, to explore sexuality, identity, and the crippling expectation that comes along with growing older.

Amanda Hyde (Smash) - Amanda makes her on screen debut as Smash walking away with whole scenes. Brash, funny, and with a fuck it all attitude that makes her totally engrossing to watch. Raw talent is so much fun to find!
Andy Gala (Asit ""Happy"" Panjabi) - Andy Gala aka Narendra Gala is an American Actor, born in Los Angeles California to Indian American immigrant parents. A CalArts graduate, Andy has appeared in a number of hit shows, including; Criminal Minds, New Girl, Outsourced, Happy Endings, Hot In Cleveland, and Bad Judge just to name a few.

He received a BFA from Florida State University and co-founded Dad's Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta. He went on to co-create NYC's Off-Broadway hit The Nuclear Family, a fully improvised musical with longtime comedy partners Jimmy Ray Bennett, John Gregorio, and Matthew Loren Cohen. The show was since then developed into a pilot called The Extended Family as part of Viacom's TV Lab and airs on the Sundance Channel. His current series The Big Gay Sketch Show (2006) produced by Rosie O'Donnell has exposed his comic talents to the film world with several features on the horizon.
Nicole Faulkner (Makeup Artist) - We're incredibly blessed to have Nicole on board to beat these faces! Her talent is only rivaled by her overall badassery. You may have seen her work on the VMA's this year during Nicky Minaj's opening performance. And you can even catch her weekly on MTV's Todrick. Her work is nothing short of transformative, and we can't wait to bring some sickening looks to you over the course of the season! Check out a sample of her work.... 
YAAAAASSSSSS!THE MUSIC

No story about drag queens is complete without some sickening beats! We were truly blessed to be able to collaborate with the immensely talented Jessica Sutta on the pilot, and look forward to showcasing music from her upcoming debut album, ""Feline Resurrection"" as the season progresses. Jessica was a founding member of the mega successful girl group, The Pussycat Dolls and has several number 1 hits to her name as a solo artist, including the dance track ""Show Me"" which is featured in our pitch video!THE IMPACTDiversity. It's become a hot button issue these days, and frankly, we think it's about damn time! But even though the narrative is increasingly inclusive and self-aware in Hollywood, the statistics remain stubbornly lopsided. Diversity is something that's incredibly important to us as story-tellers. Our cast and crew is full of people from all walks of life, people of all shapes, sizes, genders, identities, orientations and nations of origin. Not only are we creating opportunities for people of color to make and distribute material with us at the center of the narrative, through crowdfunding, we are taking an active part in making everyone an integral part of that process!""BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?? WHAT ABOUT JUJUBEE!?!""How does your contribution help you? Aside from the gag-worthy perks and opportunities we have available to backers, you get to be a HUGE part of the diversity revolution. The web is the next frontier, a place where audiences can directly influence (and support) the kind of content that they want to see. Stories that feature colorful casts, that place marginalized communities dead center, and feature the next wave of Hollywood talent. RISKS AND CHALLENGESAs with any shoot, there's an element of risk, and a fair share of obstacles. You can always expect a bump in the road somewhere along the line, but our team is seasoned and professional. We've all spent plenty of time on set, and with Sebastian at the helm we have someone with a proven track record in the digital market. Basically, gurl, we got this.OTHER WAYS TO HELPOf course we understand that everyone isn't swimming in olympic size pools of money and while every little contribution helps, sometimes you just ain't gots it.No worries, girl. HELP US SPREAD THE WORD. Share on facebook, twitter, intragram, snapchat, EVERYWHERE! Share it with your mother, your friends, your enemies (that'll teach those bitches). Shout it from the rooftops! The more people know about us, the more likely we'll reach our goal and we'll be able to get the rest of the season to you, wrapped in one hell of glamorous bow.
   Sebastian hard at work behind the scenes.


Make up artist extraordinaire, Nicole Faulkner, making sure that beat stays fresh.



Talk about multi-faceted, Sebastian La Cause choreographing Kara Melle's coming out performance in the pilot, ""Retrograde"".



Ian and Santana rehearse a pivotal scene.



""And the nominees are...."" Sebastian, Stephen, and Ian pose for a picture after the final shot of the ""Life's a Drag"" pilot. These boys would go on to nab best director, actor, and supporting actor nominations for their work!

<p><i>Tim's Encounter</i> is a science
fiction drama about a timid, but smart 12-year-old boy, Tim, who attempts to contact

<p><i>Thanatos </i>is a short horror film that is in production and will be filming in late February/early March of 2016. The idea came from the need to understand why people are driven towards death and committing self-destructing acts. In the psychiatric field it is believed that once one's 'Thanatos' is discovered, it is a step to helping with their depression and anxieties. <i>Thanatos </i>follows a young Darnell as we watch his death drive unfold and how his psychiatrist draws closer to the reason behind it. </p>
<p>We understand that there needs to be a convincing, genuine, and relatable central character, and that's exactly what <i>Thanatos </i>will achieve. We believe in character driven stories with visual and technical metaphors from the horror genre that are convincing and dynamic to the story line. With mental issues being brought into the forefront world-wide, we want to explore a story that dives into these issues with a conclusion that is realistic and reflective.  <br/></p>

<p><b><i>LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH </i></b>is a feature-length motion picture, currently <b>in</b> <b>Development </b>and slated for production and world-wide release. It is inspired by true events, meticulous research, and well-grounded speculation. It's powerful story-telling in the wake of <b style=""font-style: italic;"">American Sniper, U</b><b style=""font-style: italic;"">nbroken </b>and<b style=""font-style: italic;""> 13 Hours</b><b style=""font-style: italic;""> </b>that gives the movie unlimited potential.</p>
<p><b><i>LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH</i> </b>is totally unique and unlike any of the many films offered on Indiegogo. It is the biggest, most ambitious, and noteworthy motion picture project ever available to Indiegogo patrons. It is not the typical independent movie, because once out of development and in production, the plan is to embody seasoned Hollywood professionals, an Academy Award winning producer, and an A-list cast in its ultimate creation.  </p>
<p><b><i>LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH</i></b> is a non-stop, heart-pounding, action thriller that weaves its way from Europe and the Middle East to South America in search for the men who, in the movie, kill Aubrey Temples, an 82nd Airborne paratrooper, D-Day and Market Garden participant, and German POW. In real life, Aubrey Temples is the only living eyewitness to the truth about Hitler’s escape at the very end of WWII. In the brief video interview below, Mr. Temples discloses how Hitler escaped from Germany on April 30, 1945, the day he was supposed to have committed suicide in his Berlin Fuhrerbunker.<br/></p>

</div><div> <p>The <b>$750,000 </b>in funding we are seeking from Indiegogo Backers is to pay for <b>Development</b> rather than <b>Production </b>costs<b>.</b>  <b>""Development"", as the term is used in the motion picture industry, is the critical ""beginning"" of a film. It is the Acquisition of an underlying Work and Intellectual Property, the Researching of the Facts, and the Creation of the Story, among many, many other factors that go into the development of a film.</b>  <br/></p>

</div><div> <p>THAT is exactly why we are doing this as a <b>Development</b> project. The filmmakers behind<i> <b>LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH </b></i>have opted to develop this special project with the help of Indiegogo Contributors for three very important reasons: </p>
<p><b>1)</b> <b>To insure that such a controversial, politically charged, and historically challenging story is created without compromise;</b> </p>
<p><b>2)</b> <b>To control what decisions are made at the inception of the Production Phase</b><b>;</b> </p>
<p><b>3)</b> <b>To create as much world-wide advance interest in the film as humanly possible. </b><br/></p>
<p>If we surpass our goal, we will use the additional funds to further enhance the Development package. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If we don't succeed in raising our projected goal, we will employ the monies raised principally and primarily on the Screenplay, (which is the heart and soul and singularly most important element of any film), as well as other contributing elements of the story. Regardless and in any event, we plan to go forward with either investor participation, production (film) financing, a Joint Venture (JV) with a Major Studio, or an outright sale to a Major Studio so that the movie can be made (See Risks &amp; Challenges below).</span></p>

<h1>A Message from Director Kieth Merrill</h1>
<p>“Over a long and wonderful career in the movie business, and having had the privilege of writing, producing and directing some very successful films, I have to say that <b><i>LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH</i></b> is, without question, the most explosive and dynamic film project I've ever had the opportunity to be involved in. Due to several startling discoveries in recent years, this action adventure-thriller, based on a true story, will truly take audiences where they've never gone before and leave them breathless. The creative independence you give us via Indiegogo will insure that the truth will unquestionably be told…. and you will not be disappointed.” </p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p><b>There are many risks in developing, producing and distributing a motion picture, especially films designed to be International in scope. The Risks inherent in this project are as follows:</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">No commitment for Production funding.

Development is the process of research, writing the script, selecting locations, production schedule and selecting the creative team. </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The

A 
precise Production (filming) budget cannot be created until the script is 
completed, the locations determined, the creative team selected, and the 
production plan in place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Once Development is completed, a DGA Production Manager will prepare a 40 page, line-item budget and calculate the precise cost of the picture. In addition to the the actual cost of production, additional money may be required for A-List Actors, Producers and Director. These additional costs can vary greatly, depending on who is cast.</span></p>
<p>The 
question everyone obviously asks themselves is <b>“OK, so what happens if I go ahead and contribute to this project and the film is developed, then what? How does the script and the development package turn into a movie?""</b></p>
<p>The possibilities following Development include: 1) JV with an alliance of 
Independent Production companies, 2) Joint Venture (JV) with a Major or 
Mini-major Studio,  3) Sell the Development package to a Major or Mini-major 
Studio, or 4) Raise the funding from private investors and/or investment 
companies and produce the film ourselves. The key to getting independent 
financing is to have a high-quality Development Package completed and in 
hand. It is at this point that 
""Development"" and ""Production"" would merge, thereby allaying any concerns about 
a perceived disconnect. <br/></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our # 1 goal is to pursue the most likely possibility of getting the movie made and staying involved to insure that our Contributors receive their Perks. </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Regardless of whichever possibility we pursue in getting the movie made, the commitments made to Contributors will be a part of any contract(s) and/or agreement(s) going forward.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Obviously folks want to know that if they contribute to the project at any level, will they actually be able to see the film. </b>Consequently, if<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> we sell the Development package to a Major Studio, it will be at a contractual price and commitment level that it stands to reason that they would want to make the film, but we can't speak for them. If we Joint Venture with a Major Studio and put up half the cost of the film, we'll obviously have a lot more say; or if we do it solo and pay all the cost of the film, we'll have all the say.</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>There 
is a correlation between the probability of Production and the time and money spent 
on Development. </b>The better the Development package, the higher 
the probability the movie will get made. If we don't sell to a Major, JV with a 
Major, or have an alliance with a group of independents, our plan is to raise 
the money and do it ourselves.</p>

</div></div>","Story Summary 
LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH is a feature-length motion picture, currently in Development and slated for production and world-wide release. It is inspired by true events, meticulous research, and well-grounded speculation. It's powerful story-telling in the wake of American Sniper, Unbroken and 13 Hours that gives the movie unlimited potential.
LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH is totally unique and unlike any of the many films offered on Indiegogo. It is the biggest, most ambitious, and noteworthy motion picture project ever available to Indiegogo patrons. It is not the typical independent movie, because once out of development and in production, the plan is to embody seasoned Hollywood professionals, an Academy Award winning producer, and an A-list cast in its ultimate creation.  
LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH is a non-stop, heart-pounding, action thriller that weaves its way from Europe and the Middle East to South America in search for the men who, in the movie, kill Aubrey Temples, an 82nd Airborne paratrooper, D-Day and Market Garden participant, and German POW. In real life, Aubrey Temples is the only living eyewitness to the truth about Hitler’s escape at the very end of WWII. In the brief video interview below, Mr. Temples discloses how Hitler escaped from Germany on April 30, 1945, the day he was supposed to have committed suicide in his Berlin Fuhrerbunker.



A SPECIAL THANKS TO: President George H.W. Bush, President Jimmy Carter, Tom Brokaw and Governor Mike Huckabee for their letters and kind words about Aubrey Temples' service during WWII. 


What We Need & What You Get
 The $750,000 in funding we are seeking from Indiegogo Backers is to pay for Development rather than Production costs.  ""Development"", as the term is used in the motion picture industry, is the critical ""beginning"" of a film. It is the Acquisition of an underlying Work and Intellectual Property, the Researching of the Facts, and the Creation of the Story, among many, many other factors that go into the development of a film.  
The Impact Of Your Contribution
 THAT is exactly why we are doing this as a Development project. The filmmakers behind LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH have opted to develop this special project with the help of Indiegogo Contributors for three very important reasons: 
1) To insure that such a controversial, politically charged, and historically challenging story is created without compromise; 
2) To control what decisions are made at the inception of the Production Phase; 
3) To create as much world-wide advance interest in the film as humanly possible. 
If we surpass our goal, we will use the additional funds to further enhance the Development package. If we don't succeed in raising our projected goal, we will employ the monies raised principally and primarily on the Screenplay, (which is the heart and soul and singularly most important element of any film), as well as other contributing elements of the story. Regardless and in any event, we plan to go forward with either investor participation, production (film) financing, a Joint Venture (JV) with a Major Studio, or an outright sale to a Major Studio so that the movie can be made (See Risks & Challenges below).
You good people of the Indiegogo nation can insure that this is a great success by contributing and helping us develop this unique, one of a kind, motion picture project. Support us TODAY! We wholeheartedly welcome your participation. Pick up one of our exciting and unique, one of a kind, campaign Perks right now!

SYNOPSIS
-What really happened to Adolf Hitler and Martin Bormann? 
-What became of the billions in Nazi gold and treasure stolen in the rape of Europe? 
-Why is approximately 80% of it still missing after all these years?
-Who is Amin Al Husseini and why has history never heard of him? What is the link between Hitler, Husseini and genocidal campaign against the Jews? 
-Who is funding Islamic terrorism? Why does the Sword of Allah and the Nazi Swastika adorn the black flag of the most radical and clandestine order of Islamic terrorists? 
-What was the smoking gun and final link between the billions in Nazi gold and radical Islamic terrorism?

Why does the Guinness Book of World Records proclaim that “the greatest unsolved robbery in the history of the world was the disappearance of the treasures of the Third Reich at the end of the war?”
LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH is a treasure hunt, a spy thriller, an action adventure of the highest order with the greatest stakes of all.
A Message from Director Kieth Merrill
“Over a long and wonderful career in the movie business, and having had the privilege of writing, producing and directing some very successful films, I have to say that LOST TREASURES OF THE THIRD REICH is, without question, the most explosive and dynamic film project I've ever had the opportunity to be involved in. Due to several startling discoveries in recent years, this action adventure-thriller, based on a true story, will truly take audiences where they've never gone before and leave them breathless. The creative independence you give us via Indiegogo will insure that the truth will unquestionably be told…. and you will not be disappointed.” 
Risks & Challenges
 
There are many risks in developing, producing and distributing a motion picture, especially films designed to be International in scope. The Risks inherent in this project are as follows:
No commitment for Production funding. No Distribution agreement In place. A significant amount of Time required. Production activities may be difficult. Commercial Success is not certain. Development, Production, or Distribution may be prematurely abandoned. Cost Overruns may occur.The motion picture industry is Highly Competitive and is constantly Changing. Foreign Distribution can be unstable. Audience appeal Is Unpredictable.
The Challenges in our Campaign are as follows: There may be a perceived disconnect between the $750,000 for Development and the money required for Production (filming). Development is the process of research, writing the script, selecting locations, production schedule and selecting the creative team. The 
base, no frills, filming budget for an international film like Lost 
Treasure of The Third Reich is roughly estimated at $30-$40 Million. A 
precise Production (filming) budget cannot be created until the script is 
completed, the locations determined, the creative team selected, and the 
production plan in place.
Once Development is completed, a DGA Production Manager will prepare a 40 page, line-item budget and calculate the precise cost of the picture. In addition to the the actual cost of production, additional money may be required for A-List Actors, Producers and Director. These additional costs can vary greatly, depending on who is cast.
The 
question everyone obviously asks themselves is “OK, so what happens if I go ahead and contribute to this project and the film is developed, then what? How does the script and the development package turn into a movie?""
The possibilities following Development include: 1) JV with an alliance of 
Independent Production companies, 2) Joint Venture (JV) with a Major or 
Mini-major Studio,  3) Sell the Development package to a Major or Mini-major 
Studio, or 4) Raise the funding from private investors and/or investment 
companies and produce the film ourselves. The key to getting independent 
financing is to have a high-quality Development Package completed and in 
hand. It is at this point that 
""Development"" and ""Production"" would merge, thereby allaying any concerns about 
a perceived disconnect. 
Our # 1 goal is to pursue the most likely possibility of getting the movie made and staying involved to insure that our Contributors receive their Perks. Regardless of whichever possibility we pursue in getting the movie made, the commitments made to Contributors will be a part of any contract(s) and/or agreement(s) going forward.
Obviously folks want to know that if they contribute to the project at any level, will they actually be able to see the film. Consequently, if we sell the Development package to a Major Studio, it will be at a contractual price and commitment level that it stands to reason that they would want to make the film, but we can't speak for them. If we Joint Venture with a Major Studio and put up half the cost of the film, we'll obviously have a lot more say; or if we do it solo and pay all the cost of the film, we'll have all the say.

There 
is a correlation between the probability of Production and the time and money spent 
on Development. The better the Development package, the higher 
the probability the movie will get made. If we don't sell to a Major, JV with a 
Major, or have an alliance with a group of independents, our plan is to raise 
the money and do it ourselves.
For Contributors who opt for the higher-priced perks, the making of the movie becomes even more of a critical question.  Factors that favor the probability that the movie will get made by one or more possible means include the following: 1) Producer/Director Kieth 
Merrill is a two time Oscar nominee and winner of an Academy Award, 2) Merrill has done numerous successful films, 3) Merrill and Robinson have done two successful films together, 4) Merrill has many industry contacts, credentials and credibility, 5) Robinson is a successful entrepreneur who has an impressive track record of getting projects (including films) financed, 6) Robinson and Merrill have access to industry sources, investors, and funding methodologies. In the event the film is sold to third parties, who may be unwilling to honor any or all of the levels of our higher-priced perks, we will refund to our Contributors the cost of the non-utilized perks above $500 at the time of such sale.   
It 
is important for our Contributors to understand what Development is and why it is so important. The key elements of what we call THE DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE are: 
Rights to the book. Research. Screenplay. Locations. Incentives and Rebates. 
Production design. Production plan. Distribution plan, Story boards and Pre-Visualization, Identify Key Creative Team, Identify Key A-List Talent, Completion Guarantee, Create a precise Budget, Create a PACKAGE suitable 
for presentation. 

Assuming we raise the $750,000, Development of the movie will proceed time-wise as follows:
Development :                              6 months 
Presentations:                              2 months
Contract and funding:                2 months

Production & Financing of the Film
Every 
movie showing today opens with half a dozen credits for various production 
companies and entities involved in the funding and production of the motion 
picture. As you can see in the section AFTER DEVELOPMENT above, we go through an 
exhaustive period of presentation in search of production alliances and funding 
partners.  With the Development Package and A-List Talent, we will have many 
options for funding alliances. Only in the event that we are unhappy with alliance offers will we turn solely and 
wholly to private placement and conventional fund raising, via a Limited Liability Company or Partnership. 
As 
noted above, raising money from private individual investors and institutions is the last option, and under almost any circumstances, is unlikely to be the sole source of funding. That said, both 
Lewis Robinson and Kieth Merrill have raised significant monies from private investors and/or institutions on many different occasions, but that does not guarantee they will be able to secure funding for this film.
THE FILM WILL BE SHOT IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, which will be determined by the script, requirements of the story, and the budget. The number one rule of quality 
filmmaking is: EVERYTHING BEGINS WITH THE SCRIPT. That is WHY Development 
is so important. We approach Lost Treasure of the Third Reich the same way a 
major studio approaches Star Wars. DEVELOP the property until it is a slam dunk 
winner. THAT is what entices talent, attracts film financing, and increases the possibility of having a HUGE HIT in theaters.
The 
film will be released 22 months from the date of Development funding if all goes well.

Total Production                 12 months
Film Released                  22 months
Our preference is that the Film be produced by us in a JV with a major studio, but ONLY if the terms are right. We will push hard for the optimum JV with a major studio, but it is far more likely we will go with a mini-major or an alliance 
of independent production and funding entities. The GOOD NEWS is that because of 
our alliance with GMT Studios and GMT Releasing, we have access to major quality, world-wide distribution on excellent terms and conditions. 
Through our alliance with GMT Releasing, we have the best of all distribution options. Our arrangement with GMT would allow the production to put up P&A money (Prints and Advertising, the cost of distribution) in exchange for  a 10% distribution fee (verses 35% with any one of the 7 major studios) pari passu returns and complete transparency in accounting.
""Having been in the movie business a long time and having made films distributed by Disney, Warner Brothers, Columbia, Sony and United Artist,"" Merrill states, ""our preference is GMT Studios-GMT Releasing. No matter how the film is financed, we have access to distribution through GMT Releasing, subject only to approval of the project.""  
In concluding the RISKS and CHALLENGES section, we believe that development is the key and first step in making a motion picture that holds significant promise for success, and that is why we are asking for your help with the process. It's a story that needs to be told. In addition, we believe the additional and historical information and insights could very well make this film a media event. We want you to be a part of this Development Phase, because in doing so you will be contributing to a significant film project, as well as what we believe will be a history making event!


REGARDING PERKS:
As it concerns fulfillment of our PERKS, we are in discussions with and plan to use a major fulfillment company Austin, Texas, in order to get Perks delivered safely and on schedule. 
IN SUMMARY: This campaign is for DEVELOPMENT of the motion picture, and the target amount does not include PRODUCTION. Perks for contributions over $25 are made only upon the successful funding and production of the motion picture. Transportation and Lodging are included in certain reward bundles and are not the responsibility of the Contributor.
This fundraising campaign is subject to all applicable rules/regulations, movie guild rules, and applicable law. If any of these requirements are the basis for a potential conflict, we will, in good faith, work with you to enable you to have a substitute Perk. Our campaign has a limited amount of time, so please make sure to contribute before it ends! Also, please use Indiegogo's share tools to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. MANY THANKS!

It is important to raise these sponsorship to ensure ""The Women of the Class of 1980"" get their  room dedicated prior to all of the rooms being sponsored to other graduates.        </p><p>A list of the rooms that have been dedicated can be found here: <a href=""http://www.thethayerhotel.com/Accommodations/Room-Dedication-Program"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">List of Dedicated Rooms and Explanation of the Thayer Hotel Room Dedication Program </a></p><ul>
<li>A plaque will go outside of the door with the highlighting the ""Women of the Class of 1980"" and many of their accomplishments.  The current photo of the plaque is only a mock-up,  the actual plaque will be edited be select members of the class.    </li>
<li>The room will be filled with photos and memorabilia chosen by the Class President Bret Dalton in cooperation with the Women in the Class.    </li>
<li>The room will be a permanent testament to the bravery, fortitude and impact  of the Women of 1980 and all of those who have followed.      </li>
</ul><h3>In order to fund the room and conduct the ceremony</h3><ul>
<li>Funds can be donated in any amount, from $1 to $45,000.   </li>
<li>Anyone donating more than $300 will receive two invitations to the dedication ceremony and their name will be listed as a donor in the room on a donor list, permanently on display.  </li>
<li>The first $5,000 raised will go to fund the dedication ceremony.  </li>
<li>The rooms are $25,000 for a standard room;  $35,000 for an Executive Suite and $45,000 for a Super Suite; plus the $5,000 for the dedication ceremony (Party).    This fundraise is seeking to provide ""The Women of 1980"" with an Executive Suite ($35,000, plus $5,000, with 8% credit card and website fee for a total of $43,200).    </li>
<li>The Sponsorship plaque will read  ""Proudly Sponsored by family, friends and classmates"" </li>
<li>If the funds are not completely raised through this site, private donors will be sought to complete the raise to ensure the room is dedicated.  So all funds donated will be accepted.   There is a 5% fee for this site and a 3% credit card processing fee, so the raise is 8% higher than needed in order to accommodate.  If more funds are raised above and beyond the executive suite, those funds will go towards the dedication of other West Point Special Operations leaders as determined by the management of the Thayer Hotel.  </li>
</ul><h3>Other Classes Have Already Done This</h3><p>Several other West Point classes have already led the effort to raise the funds for their classmates rooms.   These include: </p><p>1959:  The Class of 1959 has dedicated several rooms including the 1958 Football Room  (which was the last undefeated Army football team),  the Captain Rocky Versace Room (POW/MIA/KIA/Medal of Honor) and several others.  </p><p>1960:  This class dedicated the Colonel Nick Rowe room.</p><div>1974:  This class dedicated the room to General Martin Dempsey while he was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. <p>1986:   This class dedicated two rooms: Joe DePinto, CEO of 7-Eleven and Steve Cannon, CEO Mercedes-Benz USA.  </p>
<p>There are several other classes who have contributed to the 80 dedicated rooms and who are currently organizing their planned class dedicated rooms for their most successful graduates.    </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Thus far the Historic Thayer Hotel has 80 rooms dedicated out of a total of 151 rooms in the hotel.  The remainder will likely be dedicated by the end of 2016.  The dedication ceremony for ""West Point Women of 1980"" is currently planned for spring 2016 if the funds are raised.  </p>
<ul>
<li>By donating you will be helping to ensure the millions of guests who visit West Point will remember the Women of the Class of 1980 and those who have been inspired by them.  </li>
<li>You can currently visit the Thayer Hotel to see other rooms and stay in rooms dedicated to Buzz Aldrin, BG Becky Halstead, Henry O. Flipper (1st African-American graduate of West Point) and other amazing graduates.  </li>
<li>Future cadet candidates, men and women, can come to visit West Point and be inspired by the leadership shown by these women and understand the opportunities afforded to them if they are accepted into West Point are limitless. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Thayer Hotel management team has already raised the funds to dedicate 80 rooms out of the 151 rooms in the hotel.   They are rapidly dedicating the remaining rooms.  If this and other fundraising efforts are not successful for this particular room, then the Women of the Class of 1980 will not be honored in a way that they deserve.  </p>
<p>There currently is only one room sponsored to honor a female graduate:  BG Rebecca Halstead, USMA 1981.  There are several other rooms that have been nominated and are seeking sponsors including: </p>

</div><br/></div>","Help Dedicate the ""Women of the Class of 1980"" Room at the Historic Thayer Hotel at West Point In 1976 the first women entered West Point.  119 new cadets entered in the summer of 1976 and 62 graduated as Second Lieutenants in 1980.  This esteemed group of trailblazers, the ""Women of the Class of 1980"" have earned their place in history and are deserving of a room at the Historic Thayer Hotel.  This room dedication effort is being led by the President of the Class of 1980, Bret Dalton.   When the room is dedicated it will be a great event that can be a mini-reunion.    It is hoped that this effort will be funded by men and women, grads and non-grads, to honor this group of graduates and their accomplishments..  There will be a conference April 28-30 at West Point to honor 40 years of women at the Academies.  It is hoped that this room can be dedicated prior to that event so that all attendees can visit it.  The Historic Thayer Hotel at West Point was built in 1926 and is one of our national treasures, located on the grounds of West Point, high above the banks of the Hudson River.   The 151 guest rooms of the hotel are being dedicated in honor of some of West Point's most famous graduates: Presidents,Generals, Astronauts, Medal of Honor recipients, CEOs, Governors and other distinguished leaders of character.    The program has been so successful it was even featured on a FOX News show that highlights the program:  FOX NEWS SHOW FEATURING THE ROOM DEDICATION PROGRAMOver half the guest rooms have now been dedicated by families, friends, West Point classmates and corporations including  USAA, Pentagon Federal Credit Union, OshKosh, Remington, Jostens and the classes of 1959, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1974 and 1986.     There are two steps to achieving a dedicated room:  first is a nomination and second is a sponsorship that allows the dedication to occur.  First, a Thayer Hotel committee chooses graduates who are worthy of a room nomination.  Out of 60,000 West Point graduates in history there are countless incredible leaders who have shaped our world.   There is certainly no way to provide a definitive list of the top 151 graduates.   Rather, this program seeks to honor a representative cross section from all aspects of inspirational leadership.  That list is several hundred graduates long, more than the number of rooms available. While most rooms are dedicated to individual graduates, there are a few exceptions to honor families of graduates or groups of graduates.   There is an Army Baseball Room, a 1953 Army Football team room and a 1958 Army Football Team room (The last undefeated Army football team).     The Women of the Class of 1980 are a unique group and deserve to be honored and thus the committee found  this group worthy of a room dedication and approved the nomination. It is important to raise these sponsorship to ensure ""The Women of the Class of 1980"" get their  room dedicated prior to all of the rooms being sponsored to other graduates.        A list of the rooms that have been dedicated can be found here: List of Dedicated Rooms and Explanation of the Thayer Hotel Room Dedication Program 
A plaque will go outside of the door with the highlighting the ""Women of the Class of 1980"" and many of their accomplishments.  The current photo of the plaque is only a mock-up,  the actual plaque will be edited be select members of the class.    
The room will be filled with photos and memorabilia chosen by the Class President Bret Dalton in cooperation with the Women in the Class.    
The room will be a permanent testament to the bravery, fortitude and impact  of the Women of 1980 and all of those who have followed.      
In order to fund the room and conduct the ceremony
Funds can be donated in any amount, from $1 to $45,000.   
Anyone donating more than $300 will receive two invitations to the dedication ceremony and their name will be listed as a donor in the room on a donor list, permanently on display.  
The first $5,000 raised will go to fund the dedication ceremony.  
The rooms are $25,000 for a standard room;  $35,000 for an Executive Suite and $45,000 for a Super Suite; plus the $5,000 for the dedication ceremony (Party).    This fundraise is seeking to provide ""The Women of 1980"" with an Executive Suite ($35,000, plus $5,000, with 8% credit card and website fee for a total of $43,200).    
The Sponsorship plaque will read  ""Proudly Sponsored by family, friends and classmates"" 
If the funds are not completely raised through this site, private donors will be sought to complete the raise to ensure the room is dedicated.  So all funds donated will be accepted.   There is a 5% fee for this site and a 3% credit card processing fee, so the raise is 8% higher than needed in order to accommodate.  If more funds are raised above and beyond the executive suite, those funds will go towards the dedication of other West Point Special Operations leaders as determined by the management of the Thayer Hotel.  
Other Classes Have Already Done ThisSeveral other West Point classes have already led the effort to raise the funds for their classmates rooms.   These include: 1959:  The Class of 1959 has dedicated several rooms including the 1958 Football Room  (which was the last undefeated Army football team),  the Captain Rocky Versace Room (POW/MIA/KIA/Medal of Honor) and several others.  1960:  This class dedicated the Colonel Nick Rowe room.1974:  This class dedicated the room to General Martin Dempsey while he was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 1986:   This class dedicated two rooms: Joe DePinto, CEO of 7-Eleven and Steve Cannon, CEO Mercedes-Benz USA.  
There are several other classes who have contributed to the 80 dedicated rooms and who are currently organizing their planned class dedicated rooms for their most successful graduates.    
The Impact
Thus far the Historic Thayer Hotel has 80 rooms dedicated out of a total of 151 rooms in the hotel.  The remainder will likely be dedicated by the end of 2016.  The dedication ceremony for ""West Point Women of 1980"" is currently planned for spring 2016 if the funds are raised.  

By donating you will be helping to ensure the millions of guests who visit West Point will remember the Women of the Class of 1980 and those who have been inspired by them.  
You can currently visit the Thayer Hotel to see other rooms and stay in rooms dedicated to Buzz Aldrin, BG Becky Halstead, Henry O. Flipper (1st African-American graduate of West Point) and other amazing graduates.  
Future cadet candidates, men and women, can come to visit West Point and be inspired by the leadership shown by these women and understand the opportunities afforded to them if they are accepted into West Point are limitless. 

Risks & Challenges
The Thayer Hotel management team has already raised the funds to dedicate 80 rooms out of the 151 rooms in the hotel.   They are rapidly dedicating the remaining rooms.  If this and other fundraising efforts are not successful for this particular room, then the Women of the Class of 1980 will not be honored in a way that they deserve.  
There currently is only one room sponsored to honor a female graduate:  BG Rebecca Halstead, USMA 1981.  There are several other rooms that have been nominated and are seeking sponsors including: 



Andrea Lee Hollen, USMA 1980, Rhodes Scholar, 1st Female Graduate of West Point


Colonel Kristin Baker, USMA 1990, 1st Female Cadet First Captain


Major Anne McClain, USMA 2002, 1st Female NASA Astronaut


Pat Locke and Joy Dallas, USMA 1989, 1st Female African-American Graduates  


Ranger Women Room, to honor the 1st Three Female US Army Rangers, all West Point graduates

<h4>A little bit of history</h4>
<p>In 2012, with the help of some friends, we made a 60-minute suspense film
called “Muscadine Wine” for less than $1,000, thanks to the amazing help of our friends. We had 2 FULL CAPACITY premiere screenings in Memphis,
TN, (where the movie was filmed), and we did a LIMITED EDITION DVD release that SOLD OUT. Again, it was done with NO BUDGET. But we finished it! And
judging by the reviews from those who’ve seen it, people seem to dig it. Here
is the trailer…</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F82TgcMQRqls%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D82TgcMQRqls%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F82TgcMQRqls%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

</div><div> <p>
In 2006, I wrote my adventurous dramatic-comedy script called “Dig That!”, and we attempted to film it with NO BUDGET. Which was a BIG mistake. A few scenes into filming, with sub-par equipment, the camera broke and we had to put everything on hold…until now! With your help, we can finally make this movie and get it released.</p>
<p>Starting NOW, I need your help to fund the production, and
possibly even be involved in the movie itself. Here is how your help will help, and how you can even be part of the movie...YES, I said be part of it...as in, have a part in the movie:<br/></p> <ul> <li>By contributing NOW, you can help ensure that we get the production started. Once we get underway, there will be new opportunities to get involved and be part of the crew/cast.</li>
<li>The BIGGER the BUDGET =The more cool stuff we can do! (crazier stunts, niftier locations, cameos from well-known actors, musicians, &amp; celebrities, etc.)</li> <li>Get LIMITED EDITION perks including DVDs, CDs, and T-shirts. These will ONLY be available during this campaign. Once we collect the orders and have them printed, there will be NO MORE. So reserve yours NOW!</li>
<li>If we don't reach the goal, we will still make a cool short film and send the perks to everyone who orders. But I know you freaky fun-loving weirdos want to see this movie get made, so let's do this!<br/>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to get good distribution, and possibly get it into
theatres, we need to prove that there are enough of you demanding to see it. We
need to show the distributors that people besides my friends and family will
show up to see it, or maybe even watch it on Netflix.</p>

<h4>Here are some of the reasons we need a budget to get started:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Hire a cinematographer so I don’t have to set up the camera myself, and then act in front of it (it makes it very difficult to get moving shots).<br/>
</li>
<li>Get better equipment + transportation of said equipment.</li>
<li>Pay an awesome crew to work on set taking care of all the crazy stuff that needs to be taken care of so we can make a really freaking awesome movie!<br/>A GOOD CREW IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKING A GOOD FILM.</li>
<li>Manufacture the products you will be ordering (DVDs, T-shirts, CDs, etc.) So please be sure and ADD an extra contribution when completing your perk.</li>
<li>Pay our personal photographer to stay on set and take pictures so we can give you special behind-the-scenes footage &amp; photos. Once you order ANY PERK, you are automatically subscribed to get updates from the set of the movie.</li>
</ol>
<div>I’ve been waiting 10 years to make my movie ""Dig That!"". This movie is very special to me. To do it the way I’ve always dreamed of doing it, we need a BIG BUDGET. So our main goal is $1,000,000. And we need to raise it OURSELVES! Which isn't crazy considering most movies have multi-million dollar budgets. But to simply get started and ensure we get to work on the movie this year (2016), we need to raise at least $50k by February 24th. Once we hit $50k and go 'in-demand', there is NO LIMIT to how much we can raise. So please CONTRIBUTE NOW, and contribute often. As we progress, we will release new 'stretch goals' and unlock new perks, as well as release new info and updates about the movie (movie stars, production secrets, etc.). The bigger the budget we raise together, the better the movie we can make! That's just how movie-making works.

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Extra Perks:</span>
</h3>
<div>
<div>
<h4>$100 - ""Name in the credits""</h4>Anyone who contributes more than $100 (in contributions, not perks), will get to see their name listed in the 'thank you' credits at the end of the movie. </div>
<h4>$500 - ""I wanna be in your movie""</h4>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Wanna be seen in a scene? You could be 'Guy Walking Down Street'. Or you could even be 'Girl Sitting In Restaurant'. Anyone who supports this movie enough to chip in over $500 (in contributions, not perks), will be guaranteed to be an extra in a scene in the movie. (must provide your own travel/expenses to Memphis, TN)</span>
</div>
<div>
<h4>$1,000 - ""I'm ready for my close-up, mister Sticky""</h4>Ever wanted to be that person who they cut to for a reaction shot when something happens in a movie? Well, here's your chance! Those of you who contribute more than $1,000 smackaroos (in contributions, not perks), will get a close up shot somewhere in the flick. (Again, must provide your own travel/expenses to Memphis, TN)</div>
<div>
<h4>$2,000 - ""Just give me, like, one line or something""</h4>If you are an up and coming actor and you want a really cool credit on your resume, or you just want to say something in a movie so you can brag to your friends, here is your chance to have a speaking role in ""Dig That!"". This once in a lifetime mov...no wait. This movie will never be on Lifetime. Let me rephrase. This once in a lifetime opportunity is only available to 5 people who contribute more than $2,000 (in contributions, not perks). </div>
<div>
<h4>$5,000 - Executive Producer</h4>If you've ever wanted to see your name in the credits of a movie as an Executive Producer, this is your chance (in contributions, not perks). Because Executive Producers do just that. They enable the execution of the production. Which means they put in money to help it get made. Or if you've already been one, and want to be one again, this will be a great addition to your titles. </div>
<div>
<h4>$15,000 - Keep The Van</h4>We need to recreate the wrapped Muck Sticky van that was used between 2006-2012 for touring &amp; promotion. If you contribute $15,000 (in contributions, not perks) to help us recreate this for the movie, you will get to keep the van after the movie is finished filming.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p> Of course, there are always great risks and challenges when making a movie. That kinda goes without saying, but too late because I already said it. And everyone knows that in order to achieve great things, you must take great risks. And that's what this movie is actually all about. Taking risks. It tells the story of a guy who struggles between being stuck in a rut and taking a leap of courage. It's an adventurous dramatic comedy with a mission and a purpose. And my mission and purpose are to make this movie in 2016. Are you willing to take the risk with me?</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>There are other ways you can contribute aside from ordering perks:</p>

</ol> </div> <h4>And that's all there is to it. So choose a perk, add a contribution, and let's make a movie!</h4></div>","Howdy. My Name is Muck Sticky.Since 1999, I’ve been making music, music
videos, and short films. With 18 albums, more than 50 music videos, several
short films, and over 25 million downloads of my content, it seems that many of you
enjoy what I create. And I certainly enjoy being creative.  But I am constantly asked: “When are you
gonna make a movie?


Well, here is your chance to help me make a musical-comedic-adventure movie based on my life experiences! And maybe even be IN the movie too...IF WE CAN RAISE $50k by Feb 24th, the movie will be made THIS YEAR and released in early 2017


Synopsis: 'Dig That!' is a movie based on the life of Muck Sticky, a struggling artist on a mission to share his message with the world. After his neighbors, friends, strangers, and even family members discourage him by suggesting he will never find success as a pajama-wearing musician, he perseveres through years of triumphs and tragedies to pursue his dreams and live the life he loves. This epic comedy-adventure through the mind of Mervous Thrifty will leave you laughing, crying, celebrating, and sitting on the edge of your seat. 
A little bit of history
In 2012, with the help of some friends, we made a 60-minute suspense film
called “Muscadine Wine” for less than $1,000, thanks to the amazing help of our friends. We had 2 FULL CAPACITY premiere screenings in Memphis,
TN, (where the movie was filmed), and we did a LIMITED EDITION DVD release that SOLD OUT. Again, it was done with NO BUDGET. But we finished it! And
judging by the reviews from those who’ve seen it, people seem to dig it. Here
is the trailer…

1st Goal: $50,000 by February 24th, 2016
 
In 2006, I wrote my adventurous dramatic-comedy script called “Dig That!”, and we attempted to film it with NO BUDGET. Which was a BIG mistake. A few scenes into filming, with sub-par equipment, the camera broke and we had to put everything on hold…until now! With your help, we can finally make this movie and get it released.
Starting NOW, I need your help to fund the production, and
possibly even be involved in the movie itself. Here is how your help will help, and how you can even be part of the movie...YES, I said be part of it...as in, have a part in the movie:  By contributing NOW, you can help ensure that we get the production started. Once we get underway, there will be new opportunities to get involved and be part of the crew/cast.
The BIGGER the BUDGET =The more cool stuff we can do! (crazier stunts, niftier locations, cameos from well-known actors, musicians, & celebrities, etc.) Get LIMITED EDITION perks including DVDs, CDs, and T-shirts. These will ONLY be available during this campaign. Once we collect the orders and have them printed, there will be NO MORE. So reserve yours NOW!
If we don't reach the goal, we will still make a cool short film and send the perks to everyone who orders. But I know you freaky fun-loving weirdos want to see this movie get made, so let's do this!


In order to get good distribution, and possibly get it into
theatres, we need to prove that there are enough of you demanding to see it. We
need to show the distributors that people besides my friends and family will
show up to see it, or maybe even watch it on Netflix.
 






Here are some of the reasons we need a budget to get started:

Hire a cinematographer so I don’t have to set up the camera myself, and then act in front of it (it makes it very difficult to get moving shots).

Get better equipment + transportation of said equipment.
Pay an awesome crew to work on set taking care of all the crazy stuff that needs to be taken care of so we can make a really freaking awesome movie!A GOOD CREW IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKING A GOOD FILM.
Manufacture the products you will be ordering (DVDs, T-shirts, CDs, etc.) So please be sure and ADD an extra contribution when completing your perk.
Pay our personal photographer to stay on set and take pictures so we can give you special behind-the-scenes footage & photos. Once you order ANY PERK, you are automatically subscribed to get updates from the set of the movie.

I’ve been waiting 10 years to make my movie ""Dig That!"". This movie is very special to me. To do it the way I’ve always dreamed of doing it, we need a BIG BUDGET. So our main goal is $1,000,000. And we need to raise it OURSELVES! Which isn't crazy considering most movies have multi-million dollar budgets. But to simply get started and ensure we get to work on the movie this year (2016), we need to raise at least $50k by February 24th. Once we hit $50k and go 'in-demand', there is NO LIMIT to how much we can raise. So please CONTRIBUTE NOW, and contribute often. As we progress, we will release new 'stretch goals' and unlock new perks, as well as release new info and updates about the movie (movie stars, production secrets, etc.). The bigger the budget we raise together, the better the movie we can make! That's just how movie-making works. Here are some of the perks we have...







Extra Perks:



$100 - ""Name in the credits""Anyone who contributes more than $100 (in contributions, not perks), will get to see their name listed in the 'thank you' credits at the end of the movie. 
$500 - ""I wanna be in your movie""
Wanna be seen in a scene? You could be 'Guy Walking Down Street'. Or you could even be 'Girl Sitting In Restaurant'. Anyone who supports this movie enough to chip in over $500 (in contributions, not perks), will be guaranteed to be an extra in a scene in the movie. (must provide your own travel/expenses to Memphis, TN)


$1,000 - ""I'm ready for my close-up, mister Sticky""Ever wanted to be that person who they cut to for a reaction shot when something happens in a movie? Well, here's your chance! Those of you who contribute more than $1,000 smackaroos (in contributions, not perks), will get a close up shot somewhere in the flick. (Again, must provide your own travel/expenses to Memphis, TN)

$2,000 - ""Just give me, like, one line or something""If you are an up and coming actor and you want a really cool credit on your resume, or you just want to say something in a movie so you can brag to your friends, here is your chance to have a speaking role in ""Dig That!"". This once in a lifetime mov...no wait. This movie will never be on Lifetime. Let me rephrase. This once in a lifetime opportunity is only available to 5 people who contribute more than $2,000 (in contributions, not perks). 

$5,000 - Executive ProducerIf you've ever wanted to see your name in the credits of a movie as an Executive Producer, this is your chance (in contributions, not perks). Because Executive Producers do just that. They enable the execution of the production. Which means they put in money to help it get made. Or if you've already been one, and want to be one again, this will be a great addition to your titles. 

$15,000 - Keep The VanWe need to recreate the wrapped Muck Sticky van that was used between 2006-2012 for touring & promotion. If you contribute $15,000 (in contributions, not perks) to help us recreate this for the movie, you will get to keep the van after the movie is finished filming. (note: Only one available, and you will be responsible for picking up the van from the set in Memphis.)

Your contribution to the making of this movie will certainly bring great joy to many people when they watch it:

Not only will you enjoy watching the process of this movie being made with your inside access, but you will also be making a difference in my life personally. This project has been sitting unfinished for ten years. Bringing it back to life and completing it will fulfill part of my soul.

students at Full Sail University. Our project THE BET was picked to be 
our class thesis film, and we are really excited about putting this 
project together and showing it to the world.
This is comedy about two friends who are always in friendly competition with each other. However one isn't so great at winning. Things are different this time when they make a wager where is makes the rules. Things are sure to get heated, and you're going to want to see who comes out on top.
We NEED your help (which translate to your hard earned money) to get the ball rolling on this thing. It would be monumental if you contribute even just a little bit!

My name is Hannah Darby, and I'm the producer of Silver Moon Productions. As a team of second year Media Production students at the University of Lincoln, we're making a 10 minute short fiction film, from a script written by Hannah Darby & Ben Peck. 
The film's idea is a (55 year old) man, just returned from prison, who was sent there for murdering his wife, upon returning to his manor home, which was previously surrounded with life, it is now empty and alone. Throughout the story, his wife pops up in places, as a constant reminder to his mistakes, and not until the end of the story is it revealed that he killed her.    What We Need & What You Get 
Although our target shows £500, we are hoping to get in the region of £150-200 to assist with the production of our project. Fortunately, we have secured a brilliant location for our film: Harlaxton Manor, Grantham, which we hope will entice a brilliant cast to portray the characters of Clint and Sophia. Any help with paying for the production will go into the production budget, such as paying for food (on set), actors, travel etc. If we should be lucky enough to have any money left over from this budget, it will be reinvested into other crowd-funding projects for films.

<p>My name is Abby Thomas and I am the writer/producer of Explorer I.  I am currently a junior at Savanah College of Art and Design seeking a B.F.A. in Dramatic Writing and a minor in Producing for Film and Television.  Explorer I was a film I wrote with the intention of producing it immediately for my Production Practicum class.  However, the goals don't stop at class credit.  I also intend on posting this video online to start a following, then proceed with submitting it to film festivals.</p>
<p>Explorer I is a film about Nikki, a quiet girl, who gets inspired to go out and explore the city, and discovers that the little people you meet in life can change you.  I wrote this film out of my passion for exploring the city of Savannah, but even more than that, my passion for the search of one's self.  This film features a young girl who starts out incredibly innocent and naive, and by the end she has found her courage and strength while still keeping to who she is.  </p>
<p>This film is going to be posted on the Internet to raise a following of all the crew and cast members, because nothing gets you jobs more often in this industry than having connections and people who know your name.  The goal is to build my own personal YouTube channel and empower other filmmakers at SCAD and in the Savannah area, then to also submit this to film festivals to further the following of the story line and the filmmakers involved.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for $1500, and here's where your money would be going:<br/></p>

<p>• $300 will go toward copyright fees and other business fees to protect the film</p>
<p>•$50 will go toward gas for transportation</p>
<p>•$500 will go toward film festival fees and expenses</p>
<p>•$100 will go toward miscellaneous expenses and backup costs</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Don't worry, we have some incentives for you to helps us out.</p>

<p>The Explorer Level: $250 or more and you will receive a personalized Savannah, Georgia trinket package that may include pictures, pins, T shirts, Irish figurines, ghost stories, and much more!  As well as credit as a donor, social media shout outs, and a physical copy of the film.</p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>This project is valuable because it will benefit every person working on this film.  It will help us get our names out there for future jobs and a good reputation, and help us build something that we are passionate about.<br/><br/><p>It will also provide a strong female lead character that is also a good role model.  It will show people a type of city that isn't typically shown in movies, and hopefully benefit the Savannah community.  We already are advertising a local Savannah company Spudnik, and have a good track record with getting sponsors to sign on for the film such as Chipotle.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks with this film is that there is no guaranteed monetary gain.  As a student, I am attempting to find people who will contribute as donors, but any funds that I do not find are going to come out of my own pocket.  However, I am confident that I will find donors and raise the money, because I am confident about this film.  As stated, we already have local restaurant Spudnik as a sponsor and Chipotle.  We are also looking into various soda companies and coat companies.  We are trying to be incredibly frugal and intelligent about our purchases, and I know that we can do it.</p>

My name is Abby Thomas and I am the writer/producer of Explorer I.  I am currently a junior at Savanah College of Art and Design seeking a B.F.A. in Dramatic Writing and a minor in Producing for Film and Television.  Explorer I was a film I wrote with the intention of producing it immediately for my Production Practicum class.  However, the goals don't stop at class credit.  I also intend on posting this video online to start a following, then proceed with submitting it to film festivals.
Explorer I is a film about Nikki, a quiet girl, who gets inspired to go out and explore the city, and discovers that the little people you meet in life can change you.  I wrote this film out of my passion for exploring the city of Savannah, but even more than that, my passion for the search of one's self.  This film features a young girl who starts out incredibly innocent and naive, and by the end she has found her courage and strength while still keeping to who she is.

<p>Women writers and directors in the entertainment
industry constantly encounter roadblocks when attempting to advance their
careers – even when they are just as talented and capable as their male
counterparts. Women actors have a similar problem simply because the number of
female roles is significantly less than for men. </p>
<p>In our twenty years in the business as actors,
writers, and producers, we have personally witnessed the lack of opportunities
in this industry for women, and we’ve decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>Progress is being made.<span>  There are a lot of great organizations these
days working to increase visibility and to provide more opportunities for
women, and we’ve decided to follow their lead and do our part. That is why we created our production company…
“Chicks Who Make Flicks.”</span></p>
<p>“Chicks
Who Make Flicks” is… films made by women, films that tell great woman’s
stories, films that capture the voices of women from all over the world and at
every stage of their life. Our goal is to create an environment that supports,
encourages, and celebrates talented female filmmakers. </p>
<p>We are launching our production company with two
films - “Waiting Room,” (a drama) and “Happy Hour” (a comedy).<span>  These two films are woman’s stories that are
real and relatable. </span></p>
<p>Now guys are welcome too, absolutely, but our
promise is to put a woman in at least one key role in every film –
writer/director/producer/etc. $9,000 is our budget for the two films - both to
be made in the next 6 months. The money goes for crew, set rental, insurance,
etc. </p>
<p>Every donation is truly welcomed and appreciated,
and we have some sweet perks. Whether it is 1 dollar or 100 dollars, it all
goes 100% to this project. We also really appreciate everyone spreading the word
- by mouth, email or social media! Please share our campaign with everybody you
know and help us make this happen!</p>
<p>A great story can inspire, motivate, and
illuminate – like powerful classics such as “Silkwood,” “Erin Brockovich” and
“Boys Don’t Cry.” So in addition to making movies, we want
to promote the healing power of art, as well, and pay it forward to a place
that is all about helping women - the Downtown Women’s Center. (<a href=""http://www.DowntownWomensCenter.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.DowntownWomensCenter.org</a>) We have included $500 in our fundraising total as a donation to help
homeless women get off the street, get healthy, and ultimately reclaim their
lives.</p>
<p>Bottom line… While steps are being taken to fix
the inequality, women in the industry still need your help. Your donation to
this fundraiser achieves 3 things: 1) Helps fund two films, 2) provides
opportunities for women in the film industry, and 3) gives to a local women’s
charity. Where else does your money stretch that far?</p>
<p>Please join us in making “Chicks who make Flicks”
a reality. </p>
<p>We realize the two of us can’t change the world,
but with your help we can do our part - one woman, one story at a time.</p>

<p>Bombshell is the story of 23 year old nurse Lena Chaunce. To her friends and family she's a responsible working adult; good at her job and loved by her patients. However, underneath this exterior, Lena holds a secret. As a consequence of being addicted to the thrill of gambling, Lena has lost all of her money and is crumbling in serious debt. With a loan shark hot on her heel wanting his money back, Lena has to make a choice: One last gamble, or ultimate ruin. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to us because it's our calling card. It's an example for all of us to show what we can do in an already very competitive industry. Rather than ask for your money up front and hope for the best, we have committed ourselves to this project and plunged right in. Without doing this, we wouldn't have been able to secure the resources we have. Your money will contribute to paying back the crew the money they put in up front.

You can share our page and talk about us. The more noise we make, the more we'll be heard. Thank you. 
As the campaign goes on we'll be uploading more and more images and clips, so there'll be plenty to share. 
We are grateful for any contribution, big or small, so if you can only spare £1 we appreciate it so much.   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p></span></h3>
<p>This will be based on the true
turn-of-the-century story of the last days of Edward Mordrake. He was a kind
man, but one who was stricken with a HIDEOUS deformity from birth. He was born with two faces, one in the front
and one in the back of his head. The second face would speak to Edward in the
midle of the night.  </p>
<p>An heir to a peerage and a Symphony conductor
in his own right, he was accused of several murders, and he could neither
confirm nor deny that he had committed them. 
He had some idea that his gruesome twin may have had something to do
with the murders after Edward himself, fell asleep.  His sad and bizarre life ended in suicide.</p>
<p>This will be a spectacular production that will
have a lot of action and amazing special effects.  Our script includes murders, fight scenes,
brain surgery, and a scene depicting the evils of Hell.  It will also be a lush production featuring
period-correct costumes, hair and make-up, as well as historic carriages and
other vehicles from the late 1800’s.  For
a backdrop, we will have famous European castles, and a symphony concert
performance. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b></b></span></h3>
</div>
<p>
</p><h2><b>Our goal, your perks</b></h2>
<p>Our goal is to reach US$250,000 - which we realize is an ambitious
goal, but the making of a world-class movie such as this requires some major
investment.  As shown in the graph below,
we are allocating these funds to cover the costs of the film’s pre-production,
shooting schedule, post-production work, and pre-marketing/ distribution,
as well as some handsome perks for our investors, plus our Indiegogo fees. The
planned release date for the movie is October 2017.</p>
<p>The US$250,000 will cover the entire filming
process from start to finish - including: </p>
<p>  •  <span>Victorian
locations, castles, the concert hall and downtown
London exteriors. Wardrobe will consist of period-correct Victorian time
clothing for both Principals and extras. 
Much of it can be rented, but the Principals costumes will all be
gorgeously custom-designed.</span></p>
<p>  •  <span>Props
and furnishings, such as the carriages and buggies for the outdoor scenes,
musical instruments for the orchestra scenes, Victorian furnishing for the
indoor shots, and many other items necessary to create the reality of Edward's
last days.</span></p>
<p>  •  <span>We
are in the process of designing our special effects.  We will use some green screen technologies
and a morphing like process much like the one in Benjamin Button to make
Edward’s second face have a distinctive look and personality all of its own.  </span></p>
<p>  •  <span>We
have worked hard to come up with some much sought-after perks to honor our
donors.  Some of the options available
are to have your name on the credits, be part of the filmmaking process by
being an extra, have a dinner with the cast, visit the film shoot while in
production and be invited to the movie’s Premiere, plus some exclusive
t-shirts, mugs, posters and an Edward Mordrake 12"" doll. </span></p>

<p>In his time, the story of Edward Mordrake was
too gruesome and completely misunderstood, because Edward's doctor only wrote
one page about Edward's life.  Everything
else about his story was fabricated from gossip and speculation.  Now, with the magic of film, we can now
fathom what it would have been like to be in Edward's head.</p>
<p>You will be part of the filmmaking process
which takes places in Victorian England in 1895. The terrifying story of
Edward Mordrake and his psychological battle with his disfigured evil twin
brother will come to life before your eyes.

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2> <p></p>
</div>
<p>All projects face risks and ours is no
different.  We might not reach our
goal.  That is possible with any
campaign.  However, we are determined to
bring this project to the screen in the best way possible.  If we do not reach the entire funding goal we
will shoot the film with what we raised from this campaign and what we can
raise from private investors.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In terms of shipping Pledge Rewards to those of you generous enough to merit a physical token of our gratitude, we do not have a logistical supply chain as we are not a commercial focused sellers but only a dedicated team of creative professionals focused on filming industry. We will do our best to ship your Pledge Reward package as soon as the Edward Mordrake Movie is complete.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p><h2><b>Why crowd funding?</b></h2>
<p>We decided to turn to crowd
funding to reduce our dependence on traditional film business interests, to
build valuable awareness for our project and to offer fans the opportunity to become
involved and co-create this project with us, while protecting the integrity of
the subject matter.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction


This will be based on the true
turn-of-the-century story of the last days of Edward Mordrake. He was a kind
man, but one who was stricken with a HIDEOUS deformity from birth. He was born with two faces, one in the front
and one in the back of his head. The second face would speak to Edward in the
midle of the night.  
An heir to a peerage and a Symphony conductor
in his own right, he was accused of several murders, and he could neither
confirm nor deny that he had committed them. 
He had some idea that his gruesome twin may have had something to do
with the murders after Edward himself, fell asleep.  His sad and bizarre life ended in suicide.
This will be a spectacular production that will
have a lot of action and amazing special effects.  Our script includes murders, fight scenes,
brain surgery, and a scene depicting the evils of Hell.  It will also be a lush production featuring
period-correct costumes, hair and make-up, as well as historic carriages and
other vehicles from the late 1800’s.  For
a backdrop, we will have famous European castles, and a symphony concert
performance. 




Our goal, your perks
Our goal is to reach US$250,000 - which we realize is an ambitious
goal, but the making of a world-class movie such as this requires some major
investment.  As shown in the graph below,
we are allocating these funds to cover the costs of the film’s pre-production,
shooting schedule, post-production work, and pre-marketing/ distribution,
as well as some handsome perks for our investors, plus our Indiegogo fees. The
planned release date for the movie is October 2017.
The US$250,000 will cover the entire filming
process from start to finish - including: 
  •  Victorian
locations, castles, the concert hall and downtown
London exteriors. Wardrobe will consist of period-correct Victorian time
clothing for both Principals and extras. 
Much of it can be rented, but the Principals costumes will all be
gorgeously custom-designed.
  •  Props
and furnishings, such as the carriages and buggies for the outdoor scenes,
musical instruments for the orchestra scenes, Victorian furnishing for the
indoor shots, and many other items necessary to create the reality of Edward's
last days.
  •  We
are in the process of designing our special effects.  We will use some green screen technologies
and a morphing like process much like the one in Benjamin Button to make
Edward’s second face have a distinctive look and personality all of its own.  
  •  We
have worked hard to come up with some much sought-after perks to honor our
donors.  Some of the options available
are to have your name on the credits, be part of the filmmaking process by
being an extra, have a dinner with the cast, visit the film shoot while in
production and be invited to the movie’s Premiere, plus some exclusive
t-shirts, mugs, posters and an Edward Mordrake 12"" doll. 












Cool thing is





In his time, the story of Edward Mordrake was
too gruesome and completely misunderstood, because Edward's doctor only wrote
one page about Edward's life.  Everything
else about his story was fabricated from gossip and speculation.  Now, with the magic of film, we can now
fathom what it would have been like to be in Edward's head.
You will be part of the filmmaking process
which takes places in Victorian England in 1895. The terrifying story of
Edward Mordrake and his psychological battle with his disfigured evil twin
brother will come to life before your eyes. 

Writer/ Director Mark Christensen has worked with such stars as
Danny Trejo, Douglas Spain and Patricia Rae. To learn more about the
Director's history click to visit his IMDB 
profile.
""For some unforgiven wickedness of my forefathers I am knit to this fiend""





""For a fiend it surely is. I beg and beseech you to crush it out of human semblance, even if I die for it before it kills again""






Risks & Challenges 

All projects face risks and ours is no
different.  We might not reach our
goal.  That is possible with any
campaign.  However, we are determined to
bring this project to the screen in the best way possible.  If we do not reach the entire funding goal we
will shoot the film with what we raised from this campaign and what we can
raise from private investors.In terms of shipping Pledge Rewards to those of you generous enough to merit a physical token of our gratitude, we do not have a logistical supply chain as we are not a commercial focused sellers but only a dedicated team of creative professionals focused on filming industry. We will do our best to ship your Pledge Reward package as soon as the Edward Mordrake Movie is complete.
Why crowd funding?
We decided to turn to crowd
funding to reduce our dependence on traditional film business interests, to
build valuable awareness for our project and to offer fans the opportunity to become
involved and co-create this project with us, while protecting the integrity of
the subject matter.



Can't help with a donation, no problem:


Some people just can't donate, but that doesn't mean they can't help.

Short Summary My name is Jesse Lee Peterson.
99% of human beings--male and female, young and old, black and white-- are living in the FALLEN STATE and don't even know it. 
This Web series will explore--through no-holds-barred interviews with both known and previously unknown guests--just what this state is, the many manifestations of it, and how to break its spell over us.
For the past twenty five years, I've run an organization dedicated to rebuilding families by rebuilding men in Los Angeles. We've had some amazing breakthroughs, and changed countless lives--all without accepting one dime from the government!
We've operated a home for boys, offered counseling to individuals and families, spoken to audiences nationwide, organized protests and rallies, started a leadership academy for young people, and aired a thought-provoking radio show.
I've done thousands of interviews, some with major networks such as Fox News Channel, CNN, MSNBC, and others. But there's a limit to what I can say on TV.
There won't be a limit on my new series.
THE FALLEN STATE is my upcoming original online talk show. 
A cutting-edge, top-notch, totally original production, THE FALLEN STATE will go where no talk show has gone before--into exploring a state few speak of, and almost no one understands.
We will air in-depth interviews, dealing with the exact nature of this state of mind that causes human beings to commit any and every act imaginable. 
And for those who have the desire to live free--THE FALLEN STATE will open the curtain to show the way out!

<p>Desde hace muchos años me ha llamado la atención el proceso
de hacer una película, por lo que hace tiempo, decidí invertir en aprenderlo
por mi misma para poder hacer mis propios proyectos. <b>Actualmente estudio la maestría en dirección y producción de cine en
Los Ángeles.</b> He disfrutado de manera increíble el estar aquí. <b>He aprendido muchísimo en cuanto a
producción, dirección, escritura de un guión, cinematografía y edición, y ha
llegado el momento de realizar mi tesis</b>, la cual por supuesto es escrita y
dirigida por mi.</p>
<p>Siempre me ha interesado <b>como trabaja la psicología en el ser humano</b> así que me surgió la
inquietud de explorar esta cuestión en una situación excepcional.<br/>
<b>Vivimos en una sociedad que emana
violencia</b> y que hace que las mujeres se sientan atrapadas, por lo que
ocasionalmente reaccionan devolviendo lo que se les da. Sin embargo, <b>muchas veces es muy fácil para nosotros
juzgar sin saber la verdad</b>, así que los invito a profundizar en este
cortometraje con nosotros.</p>

<p><b>Hacer cine tiene

nosotros, siendo estudiantes, la adquisición del dinero resulta complicada. <b>Por eso les pido su ayuda para poder
hacer de este sueño una realidad.</b> </p>
<p>Desde el inicio ha habido mucho apoyo y muy buena respuesta

<p>I’ve always had a profound interest in the process of
making a movie, which is why I decided to invest in learning how to do it so I
can create my own projects<b>. I’m
currently studying a Master of Fine Arts in Film and Media Production in Los
Angeles.</b> I have really enjoyed being here. <b>I have learned a lot in terms of producing, directing, screenwriting,
cinematography and editing, and now it’s time to do my thesis</b>, which of
course is written and directed by me.</p>
<p><span>I’ve always been <b>interested in psychology
and how it works in the human brain, </b>so I decided to explore this matter in
an exceptional situation.</span></p>
<p><b>We live in a society
that emanates violence</b>and a society that makes women feel trapped,
forcing them occasionally, to give back what is given to them. However,<b>it is easy for
us to judge without knowing the truth</b>, so I would like to invite you to
go deeper into this short film.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Filmmaking is
all about teamwork and collaboration.</b> We have an excellent team,
passionate and willing to give their best, however there are plenty of expenses
to consider while making a movie, and for us, as students, the acquisition of
money can be complicated. <b>That’s why I am askingfor your help, so that we can make this
dream a reality.</b></p>
<p>Since the beginning, everybody has been very
supportive and we’ve had a very good response so we know that this case will not
be an exception. <b>Every single donation,

Desde hace muchos años me ha llamado la atención el proceso
de hacer una película, por lo que hace tiempo, decidí invertir en aprenderlo
por mi misma para poder hacer mis propios proyectos. Actualmente estudio la maestría en dirección y producción de cine en
Los Ángeles. He disfrutado de manera increíble el estar aquí. He aprendido muchísimo en cuanto a
producción, dirección, escritura de un guión, cinematografía y edición, y ha
llegado el momento de realizar mi tesis, la cual por supuesto es escrita y
dirigida por mi.
Siempre me ha interesado como trabaja la psicología en el ser humano así que me surgió la
inquietud de explorar esta cuestión en una situación excepcional.
Vivimos en una sociedad que emana
violencia y que hace que las mujeres se sientan atrapadas, por lo que
ocasionalmente reaccionan devolviendo lo que se les da. Sin embargo, muchas veces es muy fácil para nosotros
juzgar sin saber la verdad, así que los invito a profundizar en este
cortometraje con nosotros.






Hacer cine tiene
mucho que ver con trabajo en equipo y colaboración. Contamos con un
equipo excelente, apasionado y dispuesto a dar lo mejor de si, sin embargo existen
infinidad de gastos a tomar en cuenta al momento de hacer una película y para
nosotros, siendo estudiantes, la adquisición del dinero resulta complicada. Por eso les pido su ayuda para poder
hacer de este sueño una realidad. 
Desde el inicio ha habido mucho apoyo y muy buena respuesta
por lo que sabemos que este caso no será la excepción. Cada una de sus aportaciones, no importa el monto que sea, es muy valiosa. Todo el que contribuya recibirá agradecimiento especial en los
créditos del cortometraje.




Con su contribución económica, fundamental para lo que
promete ser un cortometraje excepcional, se logrará cubrir costos de producción
como:


Pago de locación
Permisos
Seguros

Diseño de producción


Equipo de grabación


Iluminación


Maquillaje, peinado y vestuarios


Mezcla de sonido


Post-producción

Inscripciones a festivales de cine

Además de proveer a nuestro equipo con:

Transporte seguro
Grandiosas comida
Un buen seguro

Y más!
Estaremos grabando la semana del 23 al 29 de Octubre del
2015, por lo que sus donaciones serán de vital importancia para poder cumplir
el objetivo. 




Otra forma de apoyar es compartiéndolo con todos tus conocidos para que ellos a su vez puedan
formar parte de este gran proyecto. 
De verdad no tienen
idea de lo que significa poder contar con su apoyo. Hemos trabajado
bastante y lo seguiremos haciendo para alcanzar el éxito. No los defraudaremos.

                      







“Departure” is a drama, which tells the story of Morgan, a death row prisoner, challenged by
her conscience in the last moments in her cell before execution. The story
shows the process a woman goes
through when she happens to debate one decision that changed her life
completely and the consequences this
entails. 




I’ve always had a profound interest in the process of
making a movie, which is why I decided to invest in learning how to do it so I
can create my own projects. I’m
currently studying a Master of Fine Arts in Film and Media Production in Los
Angeles. I have really enjoyed being here. I have learned a lot in terms of producing, directing, screenwriting,
cinematography and editing, and now it’s time to do my thesis, which of
course is written and directed by me.
I’ve always been interested in psychology
and how it works in the human brain, so I decided to explore this matter in
an exceptional situation.
We live in a society
that emanates violenceand a society that makes women feel trapped,
forcing them occasionally, to give back what is given to them. However,it is easy for
us to judge without knowing the truth, so I would like to invite you to
go deeper into this short film.





Filmmaking is
all about teamwork and collaboration. We have an excellent team,
passionate and willing to give their best, however there are plenty of expenses
to consider while making a movie, and for us, as students, the acquisition of
money can be complicated. That’s why I am askingfor your help, so that we can make this
dream a reality.
Since the beginning, everybody has been very
supportive and we’ve had a very good response so we know that this case will not
be an exception. Every single donation,
no matter the amount, is really appreciated. Everyone who contributes will
receive special thanks in the credits of the film.




With your
vital economic contribution, to what promises to be an outstanding short film, we will be able
to cover production costs such as:


Location Fees

Permits

Insurance
Production Design
Camera equipment
Lighting
Hair, Makeup and Wardrobe
Sound mixing
Post-production
Film Festival Submissions

And also provide to our cast and crew with:


Secure transportation

Great meals


Health insurance


And more!

<b>Guerrilla gardening</b> is 'the act of gardening on land that the gardeners do not have the legal rights to utilise, such as an abandoned site, an area that is not being cared for, or private property.'<i> (wikipedia)</i> </div><div>
<p>'A covert unauthorised planting of flora or crops in a public location.'<i>(dictionary)</i><br/></p>
<p>It can also be described as 'subversive gardening'. A kind of responsible rebellion. Simply put Guerrilla Gardeners are individuals or groups of people who take it upon themselves to improve areas they don't own with plant life. This can be done traditionally with forks and flowers or by seed bombing (the ideal solution for quick insurrections and for growing on those hard to reach places).</p>
<p>Most of who live in the city will find there are lots of places that could use a little colour in the form of flowers. It's easy to miss these sites but when you start looking for them you'll be amazed just how much potential there is out there. Next time you travel across a city, be it on your walk to work, driving along a dull motorway or commuting on the train, keep your eyes peeled for these areas full of Guerrilla Gardening potential. </p>

<p><b>The idea for Seedboms came from Kabloom founder and director Darren Wilson. </b>During his studies in 3D Design and Craft at university he decided to focus his attention on eco-friendly design. Finding that this area had precious few great products on the market at the time he took it upon himself to design something new. Not only did these products have to be designed with the environment in mind they also had to be innovative, fun and desirable. It was Darren's belief (and still is) that good design and good ideas and narratives should come first, the eco-friendly part should exist anyway and so from that standpoint the concept of the Seedbom began.</p>
<p>Darren decided to look into the root of this apparent modern problem, the problem modern (urban) cultures apparent disassociation with nature. The mission? To design a product that got people outside and create nature in their cities. It was also very important to design products that weren't going to end up in landfill someday. How do you achieve this? Either design something so desirable it would be passed on through generations (very difficult to do and impossible to predict) or design something that would destroy itself and be reborn through plant life. </p>
<p>And so the Seedbom was born!</p>
<p>Fact: Might sound crazy but Darren came up with this idea independently of any knowledge of the Guerrilla Gardening concept or even seed bombing! Imagine his surprise when he discovered that all his hard work actually had a movement he could associate with and participate in. This gave his product idea even more of a story, set the wheels in motion and gave Darren the drive he needed to make his design dream a reality. Serendipty at work!</p>

</div></div>","Seedboms are the friendly bombs that grow. Join forces with nature to transform unloved spaces with a blast of life and colour!
Made from recycled paper and embedded with an explosive mix of organic peat-free compost and wildflower/herb seeds, Seedboms are the weapons of choice for Guerrilla Gardeners. 
""Seedboms put the power to beautify into the hands of everyone.""                                                                                Richard Reynolds ~ GuerrillaGardening.org



Guerrilla gardening is 'the act of gardening on land that the gardeners do not have the legal rights to utilise, such as an abandoned site, an area that is not being cared for, or private property.' (wikipedia) 
'A covert unauthorised planting of flora or crops in a public location.'(dictionary)
It can also be described as 'subversive gardening'. A kind of responsible rebellion. Simply put Guerrilla Gardeners are individuals or groups of people who take it upon themselves to improve areas they don't own with plant life. This can be done traditionally with forks and flowers or by seed bombing (the ideal solution for quick insurrections and for growing on those hard to reach places).
Most of who live in the city will find there are lots of places that could use a little colour in the form of flowers. It's easy to miss these sites but when you start looking for them you'll be amazed just how much potential there is out there. Next time you travel across a city, be it on your walk to work, driving along a dull motorway or commuting on the train, keep your eyes peeled for these areas full of Guerrilla Gardening potential. 
Examples of places in need of Guerrilla Gardening / seed bombing: 

Guerrilla Gardening and seed bombing in action:

We are Kabloom and we've been in the Seedbom making business for almost 5 years. 
We've had great success in the past selling our product and so why change now? 
Traditionally we made all our Seedboms by hand, working every hour we could to meet customer demand. Basically we couldn't keep up! A great problem to have, yes, however we needed to make a change in order to meet the demand and move the business forward. 
How did we achieve this? Through research, development, re-design, materials and manufacture sourcing, increased manufacture capability and a good helping of innovation. 
With Seedbom 2.0 we are now well on the way to having the capability to meet the market demand for our product. Although the final result has the same function (that was never in question) we have fully re-designed the product in order to allow for larger scale manufacture without compromising on our values and material sourcing policy. In fact by taking the time to redevelop the product we've managed to streamline the manufacture processes and reduce waste. Importantly this has also given us the opportunity to add some new fun improvements, such as a pull pin and hollow construction for easy watering from the inside out. 


The idea for Seedboms came from Kabloom founder and director Darren Wilson. During his studies in 3D Design and Craft at university he decided to focus his attention on eco-friendly design. Finding that this area had precious few great products on the market at the time he took it upon himself to design something new. Not only did these products have to be designed with the environment in mind they also had to be innovative, fun and desirable. It was Darren's belief (and still is) that good design and good ideas and narratives should come first, the eco-friendly part should exist anyway and so from that standpoint the concept of the Seedbom began.
Darren decided to look into the root of this apparent modern problem, the problem modern (urban) cultures apparent disassociation with nature. The mission? To design a product that got people outside and create nature in their cities. It was also very important to design products that weren't going to end up in landfill someday. How do you achieve this? Either design something so desirable it would be passed on through generations (very difficult to do and impossible to predict) or design something that would destroy itself and be reborn through plant life. 
And so the Seedbom was born!
Fact: Might sound crazy but Darren came up with this idea independently of any knowledge of the Guerrilla Gardening concept or even seed bombing! Imagine his surprise when he discovered that all his hard work actually had a movement he could associate with and participate in. This gave his product idea even more of a story, set the wheels in motion and gave Darren the drive he needed to make his design dream a reality. Serendipty at work!

Pull the pin to open. Seedbom can now be watered from the inside out, watering the compost and seeds directly. 

Seedboms split open on impact with the ground allowing the seeds to sprout. The shell protects the seedlings and the root system through early growing stages.                                                                                                              Prototype testing June 2015                                             + 4 Pack Gift Boxes: Details:Corn Poppy A wildflower known for it's scarlet paper like flowers. Poppies are a symbol of wartime remembrance, peace and hope. Cornflower Power A rich electric blue wildflower, now endangered was once common in crop fields. Let's bring it back! Starflower An ancient herb commonly known as Borage. Produces vivid blue edible star shaped flowers loved by bees. Borage is said to gladden the heart. Lovebom (forget-me-not) A wildflower known for its masses of tiny vibrant blue flowers. Forget-me-nots are symbolic of faithfulness and enduring love. Pollinator Beebom A positively buzzing mix of wildflower seeds that will grow into bright and beautiful nectar rich flowers loved by bumblebees and honey bees. Butterflybom A nectar rich wildflower mix loved by butterflies as well as other pollinating insects. Help to promote butterfly populations. Urban Bloomer An easy to establish mix of wildflowers perfect for bringing life to built up areas and attracting pollinating insects. Featherbom A wildflower mix to attract butterflies and bees during the summer and produce grains and seeds for wild birds during the cold winter months. Thymebom A herb known for its scented lilac flowers. Not only is thyme an edible herb it is also an important nectar source for bees when it flowers. Catnipbom The herb all the cool cats are into. Catnip is a mint like plant that treats most cats to a state of natural euphoria.

We couldn't keep up with the demand for our original Seedbom. Our production method worked but was labour intensive and very time consuming. With our new production method we have the capability to make at least double the amount per week than we could with the potential to produce even more by scaled upsizing. 
It's important to state that things are already well under way and that we are going into production no matter what the outcome of this campaign.

Recycled paper shells
Seed supplies
Packaging
Labour costs











 With your help we can secure a bright future with Seedbom 2.0 and reach our goals to supply our product worldwide.

<b>""Dance for it"" story</b><br/>«Dance for it» is a full-length documentary

could turn all this into their lifestyle. Very lucky, aren’t they? Every week
they fly to a new country to teach kizomba, semba and kuduro on social dance

during night parties (and there is always a huge line of girls and guys
waiting to dance with them), go back home and as a result
they have nothing left from this week for their own life. they
are changing countries so fast that they don't have time to appreciate it.
They are booked for two years ahead. That means that next several years they are
going to live like this. They feel really blessed to have the opportunity to
live like this – to meet hundreds of awesome people, to be invited to a new
country where they might not even have an opportunity to come by their own, to
perform on respectful scenes, to feel that huge sincere gratitude from people
who take their workshops. Each of them dreams to fill every single day of their
life with dancing, to become better than they were yesterday and to help others
to do the same.<br/><p></p>

<br/><b>About our characters</b><br/>
</div>
<p>I met our characters a year ago on a kizomba
Festival in Porto. I have been dancing kizomba
for half a year already and wanted to improve my dancing skills by learning
from the best European instructors.  I still remember, how fascinated I
was by inspiration, freedom and inner beauty which were coming out of them
while they were dancing during their performance. I really couldn’t stop
staring at them! I remember how Paulo and Lanna didn’t stop smiling for a
second, sharing joy, energy and pride from sharing their African heritage. <span>Or how Ricardo and Paula, having a very difficult
choreography and playing powerful and severe roles, but still were looking at
each other with love and gratitude for support in such a responsible moment.
I remember how Albir and
Carola hugged each other  after they finished their performance – I have
never seen something more warm and touching – like all the love of the world
was in that hug. </span></p>
<p>These people are made for dancing and they are
giving all of them to it. They have so many stories about pain, happiness,
disappointment and hope – and all this is screaming inside of them, getting out
in form of dance.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9sXDvZukV10%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9sXDvZukV10%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9sXDvZukV10%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/><br/>A

<p>Kizomba is a pure love. This is about
having strength to overcome the fear of trusting people. This is about being
brave and open-hearted, because it is not easy to let an absolute stranger
embrace you. This is about giving to your partner all your care and tenderness,
and about being concerned about his feelings more than about your own. It lets man to be man and lets woman
to be a woman. </p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">So I went into the forest and wrote a script.  A year later, I called my old producing partner Trevite Willis.  In 2010 we produced a beautiful film called </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Children Of</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">God,</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> which we shot in the Bahamas. That movie went on to win 22 awards internationally and sell in 27 countries.  With Trevite on board and an amazing cast and crew, we made</span><i style=""background-color: initial;""> The Dark Rite</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.  Almost a year ago, we shot this weird, dark story in upstate New York.  Definitely one of my all time favorite experiences.  To be able to work with such talented people and make something so cool, was awesome.  The film is pretty awesome too.  I am very proud of it.</span>

<p><span>We are looking for finishing funds to complete the movie.  The edit is done, but we still need to do sound design, music, color correction and special effects.  I have been making movies for the last 15 years and this is by far my favorite. An avid fan of horror movies, I always wanted to direct one. I waited until I came up with a truly original idea to make this dream come true. Though by it's very nature, this film is dark,  there is also a very clear message: ""what you put out, you get back.""  Inspired by films like </span><i>Rosemary's Baby</i><span> and </span><i>The Believers</i><span>, the story starts off like a drama before the horror sets in.</span><span><br/></span></p>

<p>At the center of this story, is Kerry (<i>Eden Brolin</i>) an eighteen year old girl who finds herself the target of the unimaginable.  As she frantically looks for a way out of her predicament, she realizes she will do anything to escape.  David (<i>Ross Wellinger</i>) the youngest family member, is chosen to perform the sacrifices but finds himself falling in love with Kerry and questioning his family's ancient tradition.  What follows is a story of conflicted characters, occult rituals and hair pin plot twists that will leave audiences gasping.</p>

One of the cool things about shooting this movie was we did all practical special effects. <b> Dead World Effects </b>came in and made everything look real. Literally.  We do want to include some digital visual effects as well.  That's one of the reasons we need more money.  This is not a typical horror movie.  I feel <i>The Dark Rite</i> is, at it's heart, a drama.  Character development and the performances are vital to this story, as is dismemberment and blood rituals.  If you like horror, you will love <i>The Dark Rite</i>!  Please Help Us.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Welcome to The Dark Rite world!



My name is Richard LeMay, the writer and director of The Dark Rite.  First off, I'd like to say thank you for reading this.  A few years ago, I got this crazy idea in my head after watching the news about a string of home invasions in Long Island.  Sadly, my brain went straight to ""What if you could capture the guys who broke into your home?  What if it was all a trap so you could use bad people for some sinister reason?""  This, of course, lead to...  Witches.
So I went into the forest and wrote a script.  A year later, I called my old producing partner Trevite Willis.  In 2010 we produced a beautiful film called Children Of God, which we shot in the Bahamas. That movie went on to win 22 awards internationally and sell in 27 countries.  With Trevite on board and an amazing cast and crew, we made The Dark Rite.  Almost a year ago, we shot this weird, dark story in upstate New York.  Definitely one of my all time favorite experiences.  To be able to work with such talented people and make something so cool, was awesome.  The film is pretty awesome too.  I am very proud of it.
This is a movie about witches.  It's fun.  It's scary. And it's almost finished!






Watch the trailer!

We are looking for finishing funds to complete the movie.  The edit is done, but we still need to do sound design, music, color correction and special effects.  I have been making movies for the last 15 years and this is by far my favorite. An avid fan of horror movies, I always wanted to direct one. I waited until I came up with a truly original idea to make this dream come true. Though by it's very nature, this film is dark,  there is also a very clear message: ""what you put out, you get back.""  Inspired by films like Rosemary's Baby and The Believers, the story starts off like a drama before the horror sets in.



Every 25 years a family of powerful witches must perform the unthinkable.  Human sacrifice.  They must take four human lives, one being a member of their own family. 


At the center of this story, is Kerry (Eden Brolin) an eighteen year old girl who finds herself the target of the unimaginable.  As she frantically looks for a way out of her predicament, she realizes she will do anything to escape.  David (Ross Wellinger) the youngest family member, is chosen to perform the sacrifices but finds himself falling in love with Kerry and questioning his family's ancient tradition.  What follows is a story of conflicted characters, occult rituals and hair pin plot twists that will leave audiences gasping.
Contributing to this project will help us finish the film the way it is meant to be done. One of the cool things about shooting this movie was we did all practical special effects.  Dead World Effects came in and made everything look real. Literally.  We do want to include some digital visual effects as well.  That's one of the reasons we need more money.  This is not a typical horror movie.  I feel The Dark Rite is, at it's heart, a drama.  Character development and the performances are vital to this story, as is dismemberment and blood rituals.  If you like horror, you will love The Dark Rite!  Please Help Us.   What We Need & What You Get





We need a total of $50,000 to complete this film. This money will be put towards:

- Sound Design
- Color Correction
- Special Effects
- Music (original score and incidental)
- Festival/Delivery Costs

Please help us reach our goal!  Our perks include anything from the shooting script to Executive Producer credit in the film title.
If we do not reach our goal, the money raised will go towards the original score, as we have already begun to work on that.  Let me just say, what we have with this film right now is so good, that I'm excited to see it to completion and share it with you. We need your financial support.  No contribution is too small. THANK YOU!
