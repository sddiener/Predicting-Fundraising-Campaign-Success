<p><strong>Missie AZC-Alert</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Het AZC-Alert burgerplatform wil de weerstand en actiebereidheid van ontevreden burgers en vooral direct omwonenden kanaliseren en benutten om de besluitvorming en informatievoorziening rond de komst van een AZC serieus te beïnvloeden en waar mogelijk geforceerde plaatsing te verhinderen als blijkt dat er geen draagvlak is in de gemeenschap.</p>
<p>Wij strijden samen voor een beter en humaner asielbeleid, waarbij we begrijpen dat er mensen opgevangen moeten worden en opvang in de regio ons uitgangspunt is.</p>
<p>We willen graag benadrukken dat lokaal protest voeren belangrijk is, maar om grote veranderingen in het Nederlandse asielbeleid te realiseren, is nationaal protest voeren nog belangrijker.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1) Dit is wie we zijn:</strong></p>
<p>Het burgerplatform AZC-Alert is ontstaan vanuit een kleine groep burgers die een losstaand protest voerde tegen de komst van een asielzoekerscentrum in hun directe leefomgeving. Het offensief leidde tot een gewonnen rechtszaak, waar de rechter echter toch besliste dat het belang van de asielzoekers zwaarder woog dan het belang van de omwonenden, ondanks hun gelijk. Deze uitspraak heeft veel losgemaakt en de noodzaak duidelijk gemaakt voor een platform dat opkomt voor de belangen van alle betrokkenen, niet slechts die van de asielzoeker.</p>
<p><strong>2) Dit is wat we doen:</strong></p>
<p>Inventarisatie van het draagvlak onder de burgers, een stem geven aan mensen die zich niet gehoord voelen. Informeren over de feitelijke impact die een AZC met zich meebrengt, en in het verleden heeft gedaan. Voor het COA vaak onwelgevallige informatie voor iedereen openbaar maken zodat mensen zonder de censuurmolen van betrokken partijen kennis kunnen nemen van actuele zaken die spelen. Zorgen voor druk op bestuurders zodat de negatieve effecten niet weggemoffeld kunnen worden en ze ervan bewust maken dat zij verantwoordelijkheid dragen en er op afgerekend zullen worden.</p>

<div>Hello, my name is Nathan Birks. I have always loved nature and enjoyed gardening.  Following this passion, I earned a B.S. &amp; M.A. in Biology, focused on Restoration Ecology. Professionally, I have worked in the fields of Water Quality, Restoration Ecology and have also worked on an Organic Farm. Now I am using my education and experience to revolutionize food production.<br/><br/>Why is this campaign important?<br/><br/>Climate Change and pollution are among the biggest threats to humanity.  How and especially where our food is produced is a big part of the problem.<br/><br/>Revolutionizing  the food production paradigm may be challenging, but  it can be done!  myTerra Farms is ready to set an example with innovative urban farming solutions! <br/><br/>How will your contribution help?</div>
<div>By contributing to this campaign,  you will help revolutionize food production in this country. Through combining controlled environmental agriculture,  permaculture, aquaponics, mushrooms cultivation and alternative energy production; myTerra Farms will produce organic mushrooms, micro-greens, fish, and produce, year-round, for the local Twin-cities area, with minimal environmental impact. <br/><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>While myTerra Farms' ultimate goal is to revolutionize food production, with a zero waste closed loop system, the initial phase of this project is much more modest.  We are planning to start with mushroom and micro-green production and a modest aquaponics system.</p>
<p>For the initial phase of myTerra Farms, we are looking for $5,000 to purchase bulk starter seed, commercial grade mushroom cultures, growing supplies, pay initial farmers market and licensing fees and work toward USDA organic certification.  </p>
<p>My plan for myTerra Farms is scale-able. Whatever amount is raised with this initial campaign will be used to start the farm.  Any money beyond $5,000 will allow me to grow the business faster and expand aquaponic production.</p>
<p>What do you get for your contribution?  </p>
<p>Contributions of up to $200 will receive a gift certificate for 50% of the contribution amount.  Higher dollar perks are designed for chefs, restaurants and co-ops. These contributors will get a life-time 5%, 10% or 20% off of all purchases, plus a free sample of each product as it comes online.  This is a great way for your business or profession to save money long term, get in on the ground floor and support  a growing company.  This discount applies to all future products myTerra Farms will produce.  For Chefs, this discount will follow you should you change employment.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The potential impact of myTerra Farms is truly spectacular.  Here are a few of the unique benefits to the myTerra Farms approach:</p>
<p><b>-Hyper-Local =</b> limiting deliveries to 30 miles to reduce carbon emissions from fuel use.  Increases freshness and nutrient content of food.  Keep resource use local, i.e. not using water in drought stricken areas, like California, to grow food.</p>
<p><b>-Health Benefits =</b> micro-greens are considered a super-food with 4x to 40x the nutrition of the plant at maturity!<b> </b>All micro-greens are grown with over 70 trace minerals, to add to their nutritional value.  Many mushroom species have anti-cancer properties, are full of essential nutrients and are high in protein and vitamin D.</p>
<p><b>-Hyper-efficient Growing Methods = </b>Reduce water consumption by as much 
as 95%.  Produce more food in less space and in less time through aquaponics
 and controlled environmental agriculture.  Combining mushroom culture with aquaponics eliminates the potential pollution of mushroom cultivation (CO2) and eliminates the need to supplement CO2 for plant production.  Aquaponics combines fish production with plant production to mitigate fish waste and eliminate the need for fertilizers.  This technique also eliminates the need for soil, further reducing environmental impacts.</p>
<p><b>-Year-Round Production = </b>by growing indoors, myTerra Farms is able to 
produce fresh local food year-round, eliminating the need to ship fresh 
greens from thousands of miles away in the middle of winter.</p>
<p><b>-Waste Reuse =</b> up-cycling organic wastes from other industries as a growing 
medium.  Provides additional use for what is normally a waste product.  
myTerra Farms then turns the growing medium into compost, preventing the
 waste from ever entering a landfill.</p>
<p><b>-Urban Renewal =</b> using underutilized industrial space  and hiring local employees means more money stays in the local economy.</p>
<p><b>-Alternative Energy Production =</b> our ultimate goal is to be a net alternative energy producer.  We plan to eventually produce surplus energy through a combination of wind, solar, and bio-digestion.  We will produce enough energy to run all of our lights and environmental controls and sell remaining energy back to the grid, further reducing our carbon footprint.  This aspect of the company will grow with time.</p>
<p><b>-Food Security =</b> reduce impact of climate change and local/national disasters on food supply with local production. <br/></p>
<p>By supporting myTerra Farms you will help change the paradigm of food production, help establish a company committed to environmental protection and sustainability and increase the supply of fresh local healthy food for the Twin-cities community. </p>
<p>Please... take a stand against Climate Change and for healthy organic local super-food by supporting this revolutionary start-up today!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are always risks and challenges with starting any new business. There may be challenges relating to the technical aspects of production, with scaling up production as the company grows, marketing the product and obtaining USDA Organic Certification.<br/></p>Between my knowledge of biology, many hours of research and the many excellent professional resources available, I am confident that I will easily overcome any technical issues that may arise.<br/><br/>The business plan for myTerra Farms is completely scale-able.  We will start small and grow rapidly as funds and demand for the product increase. While rapid growth can be a challenge for a new business, the business model used for myTerra Farms should help minimize any disruptions.<br/><br/>With over 3 million people, the Twin-Cities metro area has a large demand for local organic produce, especially during the winter months.  Restaurants, Chefs, Co-ops, and Grocery and Health Food Stores are all potential consumers.  I will be approaching many of them as a part of this campaign.  myTerra Farms also plans on having a Farmer's Market stand at least one day per week to help market/sell our produce.<br/><br/>Obtaining USDA Organic Certification is often seen as a hard task. However, the myTerra Farms method is inherently organic and never uses any harsh chemicals or pesticides.  As we already use organic methods, obtaining USDA Organic Certification will simply be a matter of paperwork, cost, and inspections.  We plan to be Certified Organic as soon as possible.  <br/><br/>
<p>I am 100% confident that myTerra Farms will overcome these and any other challenges that may arise!</p>
<p>Business is already going very well and everyone just loves our products!  </p>
<p>myTerra Farms currently produces: Sunflower, Radish, Kale, and Broccoli micro-greens and Pearl Oyster, King Oyster, Lions Mane, and Shiitake mushrooms.  We plan to greatly expand our selection as funds become available. </p>
<p>Once we add aquaponics to the system we will add many more varieties of leafy greens and herbs to our line-up, as well as fish and possibly even exotic varieties like eel, sturgeon, shrimp and crayfish!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Not able to make a contribution, but still want to support myTerra Farms and all the good things it represents?</p>
<p>Please spread the word about our crowd-funding campaign through social media and share our vision with your friends.</p>
<p>Look at where your food comes from, try to buy as local as possible. This is important even at your local co-op as much of our produce still comes from out of state.</p>
<p>Grow your own micro-greens at home.  They are a simple, fun to grow and are a great way to get children into gardening and to bring some fresh greens into your home this winter.</p>
<p>However you can help, I thank you for your support.</p>

  The Impact The potential impact of myTerra Farms is truly spectacular.  Here are a few of the unique benefits to the myTerra Farms approach:
-Hyper-Local = limiting deliveries to 30 miles to reduce carbon emissions from fuel use.  Increases freshness and nutrient content of food.  Keep resource use local, i.e. not using water in drought stricken areas, like California, to grow food.
-Health Benefits = micro-greens are considered a super-food with 4x to 40x the nutrition of the plant at maturity! All micro-greens are grown with over 70 trace minerals, to add to their nutritional value.  Many mushroom species have anti-cancer properties, are full of essential nutrients and are high in protein and vitamin D.
-Hyper-efficient Growing Methods = Reduce water consumption by as much 
as 95%.  Produce more food in less space and in less time through aquaponics
 and controlled environmental agriculture.  Combining mushroom culture with aquaponics eliminates the potential pollution of mushroom cultivation (CO2) and eliminates the need to supplement CO2 for plant production.  Aquaponics combines fish production with plant production to mitigate fish waste and eliminate the need for fertilizers.  This technique also eliminates the need for soil, further reducing environmental impacts.
-Year-Round Production = by growing indoors, myTerra Farms is able to 
produce fresh local food year-round, eliminating the need to ship fresh 
greens from thousands of miles away in the middle of winter.
-Waste Reuse = up-cycling organic wastes from other industries as a growing 
medium.  Provides additional use for what is normally a waste product.  
myTerra Farms then turns the growing medium into compost, preventing the
 waste from ever entering a landfill.
-Urban Renewal = using underutilized industrial space  and hiring local employees means more money stays in the local economy.
-Alternative Energy Production = our ultimate goal is to be a net alternative energy producer.  We plan to eventually produce surplus energy through a combination of wind, solar, and bio-digestion.  We will produce enough energy to run all of our lights and environmental controls and sell remaining energy back to the grid, further reducing our carbon footprint.  This aspect of the company will grow with time.
-Food Security = reduce impact of climate change and local/national disasters on food supply with local production. 
By supporting myTerra Farms you will help change the paradigm of food production, help establish a company committed to environmental protection and sustainability and increase the supply of fresh local healthy food for the Twin-cities community. 
Please... take a stand against Climate Change and for healthy organic local super-food by supporting this revolutionary start-up today!
  Risks & Challenges There are always risks and challenges with starting any new business. There may be challenges relating to the technical aspects of production, with scaling up production as the company grows, marketing the product and obtaining USDA Organic Certification.Between my knowledge of biology, many hours of research and the many excellent professional resources available, I am confident that I will easily overcome any technical issues that may arise.The business plan for myTerra Farms is completely scale-able.  We will start small and grow rapidly as funds and demand for the product increase. While rapid growth can be a challenge for a new business, the business model used for myTerra Farms should help minimize any disruptions.With over 3 million people, the Twin-Cities metro area has a large demand for local organic produce, especially during the winter months.  Restaurants, Chefs, Co-ops, and Grocery and Health Food Stores are all potential consumers.  I will be approaching many of them as a part of this campaign.  myTerra Farms also plans on having a Farmer's Market stand at least one day per week to help market/sell our produce.Obtaining USDA Organic Certification is often seen as a hard task. However, the myTerra Farms method is inherently organic and never uses any harsh chemicals or pesticides.  As we already use organic methods, obtaining USDA Organic Certification will simply be a matter of paperwork, cost, and inspections.  We plan to be Certified Organic as soon as possible.  
I am 100% confident that myTerra Farms will overcome these and any other challenges that may arise!
Business is already going very well and everyone just loves our products!  
myTerra Farms currently produces: Sunflower, Radish, Kale, and Broccoli micro-greens and Pearl Oyster, King Oyster, Lions Mane, and Shiitake mushrooms.  We plan to greatly expand our selection as funds become available. 
Once we add aquaponics to the system we will add many more varieties of leafy greens and herbs to our line-up, as well as fish and possibly even exotic varieties like eel, sturgeon, shrimp and crayfish!
  Other Ways You Can Help Not able to make a contribution, but still want to support myTerra Farms and all the good things it represents?
Please spread the word about our crowd-funding campaign through social media and share our vision with your friends.
Look at where your food comes from, try to buy as local as possible. This is important even at your local co-op as much of our produce still comes from out of state.
Grow your own micro-greens at home.  They are a simple, fun to grow and are a great way to get children into gardening and to bring some fresh greens into your home this winter.
However you can help, I thank you for your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>As life long surfers, we have always been in search of the perfect wave. Being From Long Island we realize that consistency has proven to be a major issue. Between wind direction, swell size, tides, water temperatures, and crowds, Long Island is hardly a surfer's paradise. Our missions is to design, build, and successfully operate a world class surfing wave pool. This pool will be considered the world's best man-made wave and will be run as a member's only club. It will be built in an area that has a dense population of surfers, who do not get to experience world class waves everyday. Our goal is to open facilities like this one all over the country. </p>

Welcome to my Indiegogo to get a mermaid fin! I'm sure most of you think this is a pretty odd request, so allow me to explain the significance of getting this fin to you all and why it is so important to me!<br/><br/>As some of you may know, I work part time as various princesses for children's birthday parties. And I LOVE it. I love being able to interact with kids and adults alike as their favorite character, and seeing the huge smiles on their faces as their day gets a little more magical. One of my absolute favorites is Ariel, so imagine my joy the first time I got to swim at a pool party as her! Combined that with how I've always felt at home in the water ever since I was little- practicing my mermaid swim- and I knew I wanted to do that for years to come. Why don't I work at Disney World if I liked it so much? I totally would! Except I'm far out of their height limit for face characters. Meaning I can never be a princess at Disney World... So this is the closest I can get.<br/><br/>The fin I have to use right now is made of fabric, which means the paint comes off the bottom (where I sit on the pool steps) after only a couple swims. In addition, the end of the tail doesn't connect, meaning you can see the black monofin when I swim, which kind of ruins the illusion! I tried to velcro it together, but that looks awful too. Therefore, I would LOVE to get a silicone tail. This is where the price comes in.

I actually discovered ANOTHER finmaker who makes GORGEOUS tails for $1800! I raised about $2000 total (including what I raised outside of Indiegogo) so I have extra to go towards better quality wigs and accessories! Thank you so much to everyone who helped out.. Your generosity is overwhelming!**UPDATE**Good news! I just booked a job that will help in paying off the tail tremendously! Everything I earn for it is going towards the tail, which means... If I raise the minimum amount, I will actually be able to afford the beter tail! In addition, I got my Ariel clamshell swim top in and a new wig, so things are looking up! Please continue to donate what you can and spread the word :) Thank you!------------------------------------------Hello all! Welcome to my Indiegogo to get a mermaid fin! I'm sure most of you think this is a pretty odd request, so allow me to explain the significance of getting this fin to you all and why it is so important to me!As some of you may know, I work part time as various princesses for children's birthday parties. And I LOVE it. I love being able to interact with kids and adults alike as their favorite character, and seeing the huge smiles on their faces as their day gets a little more magical. One of my absolute favorites is Ariel, so imagine my joy the first time I got to swim at a pool party as her! Combined that with how I've always felt at home in the water ever since I was little- practicing my mermaid swim- and I knew I wanted to do that for years to come. Why don't I work at Disney World if I liked it so much? I totally would! Except I'm far out of their height limit for face characters. Meaning I can never be a princess at Disney World... So this is the closest I can get.The fin I have to use right now is made of fabric, which means the paint comes off the bottom (where I sit on the pool steps) after only a couple swims. In addition, the end of the tail doesn't connect, meaning you can see the black monofin when I swim, which kind of ruins the illusion! I tried to velcro it together, but that looks awful too. Therefore, I would LOVE to get a silicone tail. This is where the price comes in. Silicone tails are MUCH  more durable and realistic looking, but they also take a TON of time and effort and are customized, hence, the high prices.

The natural insulation of the earthen walls regulated the interior temperature year-round, keeping inhabitants warm in the winters and cool in the summers. Built on the high volcanic cliff of Santorini’s caldera, Cavehouses also provided an ideal lookout position, as they helped inhabitants spot unwanted ship invasions by Mediterranean pirates. These Cavehouses are a fascinating glimpse into the history of the island, and also happen to provide some of the greatest views in the Mediterranean.</p>

Located at the very edge of the volcanic cliff of Akrotiri village in Santorini, Greece, the Cavehouse is now more than 100 years old and has remained uninhabited and deserted for decades. Knowing what beauty and potential this Cavehouse holds, I’ve decided to share with the world my passion for restoring this Cavehouse and this part of Santorini’s history.

</div><br/></div>","Save a deserted traditional Cavehouse in Santorini, transform it into a modern bioclimatic residence, and enjoy an unforgettable stay!



In Santorini, in the Southeastern Mediterranean Sea, houses are not built with traditional bricks and walls. Instead, locals have been building their unique homes for centuries by drilling deep into the volcanic rock to create 
Cavehouses.

These Cavehouses were easier and cheaper to build, while also providing protection from the harsh winter winds and extreme rays of the sun in the summer heat. The natural insulation of the earthen walls regulated the interior temperature year-round, keeping inhabitants warm in the winters and cool in the summers. Built on the high volcanic cliff of Santorini’s caldera, Cavehouses also provided an ideal lookout position, as they helped inhabitants spot unwanted ship invasions by Mediterranean pirates. These Cavehouses are a fascinating glimpse into the history of the island, and also happen to provide some of the greatest views in the Mediterranean.

The interior of a typical traditional Cavehouse in Santorini

One of these Cavehouses was passed down to me by my great grandfather, a local fisherman who needed a low-budget house close to the spot of his profession – fishing. 
Located at the very edge of the volcanic cliff of Akrotiri village in Santorini, Greece, the Cavehouse is now more than 100 years old and has remained uninhabited and deserted for decades. Knowing what beauty and potential this Cavehouse holds, I’ve decided to share with the world my passion for restoring this Cavehouse and this part of Santorini’s history.

The purpose of this fundraising project is to save the Cavehouse from falling into ruin. My goal is to renovate this rare and spectacular structure with strict respect for local architecture, character, and style, transforming it into a modern bioclimatic rental residence. However, this project can’t be realized without your valuable and much needed support!


The Cavehouse’s location is truly one of a kind. It is literally hanging on the cliff of the caldera, offering a breathtaking view of the active volcano, the villages of Oia and Fira, the radiant blue of the Aegean Sea, and the world’s most famous sunset. The white walls of Santorini are the stuff of legend, and looking down from this Cavehouse on the edge of the caldera is awe inspiring.

The property consists of the existing ~50 sq m (540 sq ft) Cavehouse, which is currently an open space room carved entirely out of the hard volcanic rock, as well as a small piece of land of 70 sq m (753 sq ft).
The renovation plan has already been proposed to an architectural firm and a preliminary study has been conducted. The preliminary study includes a 3D architectural rendering and a study for the Cavehouse expansion plan.

A preliminary architectural study has already been conducted for the Cavehouse’s renovation
Once the renovation is complete, the existing Cavehouse will be expanded by drilling even further into the volcanic rock. The house’s total surface will increase to 80 sq m (860 sq ft), which will be enough for a spacious living room, a bedroom, an interior swimming pool, a kitchen and a WC. The current rooftop will be transformed into an entertainment area that will include a comfortable living room, a BBQ area, a swimming pool, a home cinema corner, and a spacious veranda for relaxing and enjoying the breathtaking view. These features bring the Cavehouse into the 21st century and make it an ideal destination for visitors to Santorini’s shores.








The new indoor swimming pool will make the Cavehouse one of a kind, offering to its residents unique moments of relaxation!

The WC will be entirely drilled into the volcanic rock

Part of our renovation goal is to create a Cavehouse that will be made with local materials and techniques, in addition to being energy efficient.
The renovation and redesign effort will be done with strict respect for the local bioclimatic architecture to accomplish a nearly CO2 neutral residence.

This will be accomplished by:

The use of a drainage system that will collect rainwater during the winter to supply the pool with water during the summer.

The use of environmentally friendly and local construction materials.

Avoiding traditional air conditioning systems. The use of black volcanic rock as the main building material will store heat in the winter and lock in coolness during the summer, making traditional air conditioning systems unnecessary.

The use of solar panels for heating water.


 







Your support to save the Cavehouse will have the following impacts:



Save a traditional Cavehouse in Santorini from falling into ruin. 

Create local jobs for more than 15 people during the 4-month restoration period and another 2 permanent part-time jobs (housekeeper and maintenance tradesman) during the operation of the Cavehouse as a rental residence. These jobs are highly desired by the local community, especially due to the current harsh economic situation in Greece.

Contribute to the preservation of Santorini's unique local architecture and long tradition of unique world-class masonry.

Establish an almost zero CO2 emission residence.

Q: When will I receive my perk?
A:  All perks will be dispatched immediately after the end of the fundraising. All perks related to the stay at the Cavehouse will be delivered after the completion of the renovation. It's estimated that the Cavehouse will be ready to welcome its first supporters approximately 4 months after the end of the fundraising period. All supporters will be notified and updated throughout the process.
Q: I decided to support you by staying at the Cavehouse. What’s next?
A: First, we'll ask you which dates you want to spend at the Cavehouse. Then, we’ll send you a voucher for your stay and clear instructions on how to get to the Cavehouse, as well as other useful information. 
Q: What if the targeted budget goal is not reached?
A:  In the unlikely event that we don’t manage to raise the money we need, we’ll do everything necessary to find an alternative method of financing our vision and have the Cavehouse saved and renovated. We will most likely proceed by securing a small bank loan. We refuse to give up on this dream. All perks are 100% secured and will be granted to our generous funders. For those funders who select the option to stay at the Cavehouse after the renovation is complete, we‘ll do our best to find them alternative residences in Santorini in the unlikely event that the project’s targeted budget is not reached or a bank loan is not secured.
Q: Is shipping included for my perk?
A:  Shipping cost is not included and depends on your shipping address. Please contact us for detailed shipping rates. We ship using Greek National Postal Services, so you can expect the shipping cost to be relatively low.

<p>A while back, a computer system did something that it had not been programmed to do. It started using a pair of webcams under its control to track the movement of objects that were in its visual field. There was no software in the system written to track objects.</p>
<p>SURPRISE!!!</p>
<p>Next, quite a bit of research went into figuring out why that happened. When an answer was found for why, there was a natural progression to the next question: How can we do that deliberately whenever we want? FnnTEK was formed to find that answer and put it into practice.</p>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/billsadler"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">William Sadler</a>, I am the inventor of the technology and founder of FnnTEK. The basic technology is called a Fractal Neural Network and is the source of our name. The technology is an entirely new approach for a truly intelligent system; an emergent computational architecture, not a deterministic one.</p>
<p>The theory is based on a principle called 'Strong Emergence'. Additional information can be found on the <a href=""http://www.fnntek.com/teknology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TEKnology</a> page of our website. For now, suffice it to say that we have a theoretical foundation for creating cognition using current digital computer hardware.</p>
<p>This project is the culmination of many years of research, experimentation, and many false starts. We have now moved from a single proof of concept to a product that is involved in US Government testing for use as a front line cyber security appliance.</p>
<h2>What we are looking to achieve</h2>
<p>There are two reasons why FnnTEK is pursuing a crowdfunding campaign at this time:</p>
<p>The first reason is simple - we need additional R&amp;D funding and our technology is now at the point where we are comfortable offering the services of cognitive AI as perks for the campaign. Opening the door to early adopters will get our TEK to the public more quickly and greatly enhance the capabilities of the AI.</p>
<p>Second, we do not want the Government to be the only beneficiary of our cognitive AI. Certainly they are a viable market - but the ability to create cognitive devices as ubiquitous as smart phone technology requires non-governmental customers. Also, frankly - extreme claims require extreme proof. While we are sure we can construct commercial systems, we do not currently have the wherewithal to do so.</p>

<p>We are seeking to construct a civilian developmental and production FrANN™ facility to exceed the capability of the one we have built for DHS. Not an extensive facility, we are looking to provision 4 production quality servers, two as developmental systems and two as operational systems for commercial AI applications.</p>
<h3>Long Term</h3>
<p>If FnnTEK is correct on our <a href=""https://sites.google.com/a/fnntek.com/home/teknology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">theories</a> - then almost all (I'm tempted to say all, but I'm not familiar with all other research) other AI efforts will fail to produce true cognition. Every effort that we have found in the literature requires the researcher to understand some cognitive function to reproduce it in a closed form algorithm. Don't know about you, but I don't solve a system of differential equations when I catch a baseball. I don't have to invoke algorithms to understand - understanding is not algorithmic, it is emergent.</p>
<p>So - we are demonstrating emergent cognition. Our expectation is that we will be able to achieve near primate intelligence with the next iteration of our system. Our current system uses an animal (small mammal, mouse level) nervous system complexity and feedback model. The system we are looking to fund will have the complexity of a large mammal (dog, cat) or possibly a small primate by some measurements of cognitive capability.</p>
<p>Our original neural model that controlled the cameras had the complexity of a small insect - and it was able to make a computer perform a simple  task with no programming. The ability to track objects in three-space was an emergent property of that little network, not an algorithmic one. We spent a long time figuring out how that happened. Our current small mammal AI can detect network anomalies and make a determination if they are malicious or benign. We're ready to take it to the next level.</p>

<h2>Your Impact</h2>
<p>There has been quite a bit of discussion about the 'dangers of AI' in the news lately. Most of the stories have to do with an 'intelligent' machine that oversteps its small optimization environment in an unexpected way. Something along the lines of throwing a cat into a furnace to eliminate fleas. AI says, ""Fleas Gone"" - a perfect solution but with no cognitive restraint. The genesis of this problem is the kind of AI being built - they are ever increasingly efficient optimization machines. But they are NOT cognitive. An AI that is truly cognitive recognizes the constraints of the problem without them having to be stated explicitly. The solution is not to stuff the genie back into the bottle - the solution is to get the genie on your side.</p>
<p>The development of cognitive AI vs optimizing AI is the method by which the genie can be tamed. Your contributions to this effort will make it happen.</p>
<p>We are on the way! The first two tests of our systems have revealed that our network appliance can detect network anomalies faster than human operators, and can react to incidents where it was trained faster than the human operator. Our next series of tests will put our system in control of the security of a test network first, then a live operational environment. We are looking forward to taking those techniques into the public arena with your assistance.</p>

</div></div>","In the modern world every ninth person has diabetes, every eighth suffers from obesity, and every fourth has hypertension. We think that we have found a great way to help them. Really. 
While people try to manage their lives, their time, their health, their money, their diet, they use a huge number of different tools for that. The problem is, these tools often need even more time, more money, and they cause even more troubles. Some of them are just inconvenient, and almost every single tool you can find is incompatible with everything that you already have. They simply were not designed to work together! So we have a very ambitious goal. We are building an ecosystem of devices and programs to create one solid environment which is going to help you to manage every aspect of your life. It's going to be simple, useful and affordable. 
We begin with the most important part. The cooking process.





For many people kitchen is a small center of the universe. And we want to make it as convenient as possible.So we have started with the design and came up with this square shape. It allows you to save your precious storage space and makes your kitchen look cleaner.



Next, we wanted to make our dishes smarter. The new materials allow us to install the entire smart system inside of the pan, including temperature and humidity sensors. It made it possible to manage the cooking process very carefully, so we needed an automatic system to control it.





All you have to do is to put your kettle on the stove. It will recognize the object andlaunch its own unique program: heat to a boil and turn off. No buttons, no whistles. And yes, when your water is hot enough, you get a notification to your smartphone. Nothing can be easier!






For the proper control of finance, needs thought out purchases plan, as well as we now know how to cook, then why not combine these systems? And on the basis of the food you purchased, your system will offer you recipes that loaded in your kitchen system. And the perfect lunch or dinner will be ready without hassle.

By the way, it does not matter, how exactly you put a pot, a pan or a kettle on the surface of the stove. Our system detects the object by itself. 
You can do it this way: 



Or this way: 


It makes no difference. Your dinner is going to be excellent in any way.







Now, when our system knows what you eat, it can take care of your health.
Weight control system:





Our scales are connected to the system, so you can get all the data to your smartphoneor computer. You can use this information to keep a diary and control your weight. You may add up to nine users, so you can receive the information about all of your family members. As the system knows your weight and your ration, it can propose you an optimal diet according to your weight and age.



Temperature control:
There's nothing more common than a thermometer, right? But we made it smart, too. It does not only measures your body temperature, it generates a graph which might be sent to your doctor.



If you (or your child) have fever, your doctor gets notified immediately.



Blood sugar control:
Our blood sugar tester is unique. It uses a non-invasive method of measuring, so there will be no more needles and no more pain. 



All you need to do is to touch it, and you'll get a detailed graph which allows you to track your blood sugar level in dynamics or provide your doctor with the most precise data. 

The device can remind you about the time of measurements. When the system knows your blood sugar level, the food you like and your daily activities, it can help you to chose the best diet according to your condition.




Blood pressure control:

This system is very easy to use, too. Just put your finger inside the sensor and press the button to get the information about your blood pressure and heart rate. You may send it to your doctor or use it to create the most efficient training schedule. The sensor is tiny, so you can use it everywhere, right on the go. 

You can access the information provided by the sensor from your smartphone or tablet whenever you want.


 When we design each element of our system, we think of people who will use it, of how they are going to use it, of how to make it simple and convenient. We came up with the idea called “One button design”: whatever you need is one click away.





Many elements of our system allow you to heat only the desired part of the surface which saves space and energy.








The whole system is based on the MediaTek MT7681 chip which is a compact Wi-Fi SoC.It lets us build tiny things with the widest range of functions. It is safe and reliable, so we can mount it in every element of our system.








Electronic elements in our dishes are protected by a special airgel, which doesn't let thehigh temperature affect it. The construction itself is fairly simple. It looks like this: 



This scheme allows us to significantly reduce the cost of the product. There are no 
expensive elements or technologies in the client's equipment, all the information is being processed in the cloud. Besides, we provide our customers with a reliable cloud storage and grant them permanent access to their data. You need no special knowledge to start using our system. You don't need any wires. All you need is an Internet connection and a smartphone.





Our system is neither another home automation technology, nor just a bunch of devices tracking where you are, taking photos of your meal and posting your sports achievements to the social network. Our goal is to make your life easier, healthier and happier with the system, which comprehensively covers all aspects of your life. We are talking about the new life experience. No more painful blood tests or uncomfortable blood pressure monitors. No more long conversations with you doctor, while trying to explain your symptoms. No more stickers around the house where you were trying to keep track of so many things simultaneously. No more meal burnt down to embers. Our system is going to take care of it. It will help you with your daily routines, it will let you chose your diet more accurate, it will let you plan your activities more efficiently. Knowing your eating habits, it will even help you to put up your grocery list if you provide your favorite recipes to the system. 







It is a new lifestyle. A smart lifestyle for you and your family.


 





We have completed all stages of the design, and now we are ready to start building prototypes. We have two teams of developers who are ready to start implementing the software. So yes, we are ready to bring our system to the physical world!










Because no one has ever done anything like this.
Because there are no systems of this kind in the world yet. 
Because people will always be concerned about their helth. And they will always cook their meal. 
Because we offer an absolutely new system which can significantly improve the quality of your life.
Because we change the most important things for the better.

<p><b>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</b></p>
<p>A strong,
independent and objective news voice is critical for Compton, Calif., as the
City strives to redefine its image while closely monitoring the workings of
city government and business. Compton is a municipality south of downtown Los
Angeles of slightly more than 100,000 residents; a city that had been void of a
newspaper before the emergence of the <i>Compton
Herald</i> in 2013. The Herald serves as an important objective voice providing general coverage of important issues that impact the public to up-close-and personal investigative stories of public
officials. The Herald also strives to publish the profiles and features of local
interest that serve to re-define a city beset by previous images that have
characterized Compton as a haven of crime and violence. But Compton in 2015 is
a city on the move and the Herald reflects this, balancing the city's narrative, shaping and augmenting
its brand. </p>
<p>The Herald
also endeavors to bridge a cultural challenge in the community. The city is
comprised largely of two ethnic groups --- African Americans and Latino
Americans. The latter can be sub-divided into English-speaking and Spanish-only
residents. The Herald plans to launch a Spanish tabloid insert titled the <i>Compton Heraldo</i>, which will carry the
same editorial content to serve the information needs of the non-English
speaking community staffed with a Spanish-speaking editor for translation. The
larger staff of the Herald will produce editorial copy for the Heraldo.</p>
<p><b>HOW YOU CAN HELP</b></p>
<p>The Herald
began without the benefit of a large cash outlay but managed to publish 5,000
copies of a 16-page broadsheet newspaper on a weekly basis on faith, work
ethic, and enduring energy. The newspaper, however, has published
inconsistently due to a lack of consistent working capital. Our goal is to
raise $160,000 to pay weekly publishing expenses: $1,700 for reporting/writing,
and photojournalism; editing and pagination; printing and distributing 5,000
copies. The capital will also pay for an office, paid office secretary, and
utility expenses to publish consistently every week for one year independent of
city government. Following one year (52 straight weeks) of publishing the
Herald will qualify under California state law for adjudication by the Los
Angeles County Superior Court, which will enable the Herald to legally bid for
lucrative legal advertising from the City Attorney. Revenue from legal advertising
will effectively create a strong fiscal foundation for expansion and growth as
the Herald strives to further strengthen its finances through retail and
corporate advertising revenue.</p>
<h4>A BENEFIT FOR THE COMMUNITY</h4>
<p>Every city
and town in America deserves the benefit of a solid objective newspaper.
Freedom of the press is the cornerstone of a free democracy as established by
the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Compton will better serve its
citizenry with a strong Compton Herald serving to scrutinize city government,
assuring transparency, holding city officials accountable, encouraging citizen
participation in the governing process at city council meetings, as well as in
the voting booth. Additionally, as an active member of the city’s chamber of
commerce, the Herald will serve to foment a healthy and prosperous business
environment serving as a partner to enhance marketability and promotion. In the
area of education, the Compton Herald will also keep families abreast of the
educational policies of the local K-12 school district, and the opportunities
for higher learning at the local community college.</p>
<p><b>WHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GO</b></p>
<p>The
production of a weekly newspaper requires a full time commitment. Aside from the
expensive cost of printing, the production of a first-rate newspaper requires
an office bearing utility expenses, delivery costs requiring a vehicle w/
gas/oil expenses; and unanticipated ancillary expenses.</p>
<p>The $160,000
will be specifically earmarked for:</p>
<p>Printing
monthly:   $6,800.00 
 ($1,700.00 per week) </p>
<p>Delivery monthly:   $1,600.00   ($400.00

<p>Total
Annually:  $158,208.00  </p>
<h4>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h4>
<p>The void of a professional weekly news voice in Compton kept
residents in the dark on too many issues impacting their welfare. Only an
independent source of information could be trusted to deliver
objectively-written information on city governance while also providing news on
cultural arts and entertainment, and calendar event listings. We believe that
Compton will continue to benefit from all these new enterprises. Our readers
have grown to trust our editorial thrust and leadership and regularly respond to
our news stories in the Editorial section through “Letters to the Herald,” and
apprise us of breaking news events, and forthcoming events. The life sustainer
of the Compton Herald and challenge over the long haul will be advertising
revenue, as the newspaper is distributed free of charge to our readers. But,
our fervent belief is that journalistic know-how behind the passionate
leadership a 40-year journalism professional and experienced editor, augmented
by a savvy business model, will ensure the Compton Herald’s financial viability
and sustainability, allowing us to focus and build on the highest standards of
journalistic excellence in a community that deserves nothing less.</p>
<h4>OUR CURRENT TEAM </h4>
<p>The Compton Herald has been pushed head
together journalism veterans Publisher, Editor and Founder Jarrette D. Fellows,
Jr., a former editor of five newspapers and magazines over the course of 40
years, and a frequent popular guest on the Los Angeles talk TV and radio
circuit; Photojournalist Rodney Raschke, a 40-year-plus veteran; Marketing
Director Bene Benekwere, formerly a sales executive for Wave Newspapers for 20
years; Dennene Jones, sales and marketing account executive; IT Director Tony
Brown, 25-year veteran website and blog innovator; Community relations
representatives, Alonzo Williams and Kingsley B. Jones, both local business
veterans; and Circulation Manager Jharmaine Fellows. With the exception of our
photojournalist, every staffer is a Compton native. Free lance journalists
round out the editorial staff. The Herald team is so prolific, it appears to be
the work of a staff of 25, rather than only eight. Our campaign goal of $160,000
will truly enable us to build an exemplary 21st century hard copy newspaper and
online version. </p>
<h4>PLEASE HELP US TO SUCCEED</h4>
<p>We need your financial contributions to publish consistently
every week for 52 weeks (one year) to achieve Adjudication by the Los Angeles
Superior Court. Adjudication will permit the Compton Herald to bid for and
receive legal advertising, which will establish a lucrative source of revenue
to establish strong sustainability for the Herald.  </p>
<p>We’ve established 10 pledges that will enable you to help us
sustain press freedom in Compton, something we are deeply passionate about.

Ik werk nu 's nachts aan design projecten en overdag bouw ik mijn portfolio op en zorg ik voor ons zoontje, dit maakt het lastig om zelf aan het benodigde kapitaal te komen.
Met jouw/jullie hulp kan ik de apparatuur kopen die ik nodig heb en een studio huren voor 4/5 maanden.
Heel erg bedankt!

<p>Hi, my name is Jeff Amend.  My wife Jena and I are high school sweet
hearts and live in Orange County, California. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1160324/files/20150119142425-010.JPG?1421706265"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">life together has been amazing while discovering what we’re
passionate about.  We have worked very
hard for every penny we’ve earned and are willing to risk everything to make
our dreams come true.  We fell in love in
high school, were married in 2010, and now are very happy to say we are expecting our first baby
in July.</span></p>
<p><b>Why We Need Your Support</b></p>
<p>We have been fortunate enough to raise
money from friends we have met in the craft beer community.  But as you can guess, it costs a lot of $$$
to open the doors of a brand new business. 
We feel this is the perfect platform for us to raise some of the
money we need while spreading the word about who we are and what we’re about.  We will use the funds earned from this
campaign to spark the flame (details below), and the money we can raise from
additional investors who see this will fuel the fire.  Oh, and there are some awesome perks for
those of you who can contribute!!! </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We’ve set a goal of 40k.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In the unfortunate circumstance that we don’t reach our goal we give you our word that all the perks will be honored.  We will also give updates on our progress and if at the end of our campaign we haven’t raised all the money we hoped for we will state what we plan to do with the funds that we did receive.  Here is how we'll use the money.  </span></p><ul>
<ul>
<li>Lease deposit. </li>
<li>Lawyer fees for trademarking, licensing, construction
      contracts, and investor contracts.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">On Sale Beer
      License, Conditional Use Permit. </span></li>

     County craft beer community deserves a shop like we plan to open up.  We will create great jobs for the local
     community and plan on opening up more shops down the road.  With the profits we create we will give
     back to the community and hold many events for all to attend that give
     back to the people we serve every day. </span></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p><ul>
<li>Hitting our goal won’t get us to the finish line.  We hope to raise more than our goal but we will still need to raise additional capital from investors / partners.  Having a successful campaign will push us in the right direction and hopefully catch the eye of potential investors. <br/>
</li>
<li>We have overcome many hurdles to get where we are today.  Creating a legitimate business plan, learning the ins-and-outs of running a business, and raising what money we have so far hasn't been easy.  We've heard a lot of ""No"" but every ""No"" get's us closer to a ""Yes!""</li>

<p></p></div>","Our Dream
You walk into a warm and inviting shop
and are instantly greeted by someone with a smile and hello.  You look around and see shelves and refrigerators
full of unique and awe inspiring craft beers. 
People lounging with friends on a comfy couch have just opened one of
the bottles from the fridge while others sit at the bar and enjoy craft beers
from the tap.  Everyone is happy,
everyone is smiling, everyone welcomes you in. 
Welcome to Last Drop Bottle Shop & Tap Room.  Welcome to the craft beer community. About The ShopThe shop will hold approximately 1,000 bottles of craft beer in different styles, tastes, colors, ages, specialties, and alcohol levels.  These beers will comes from all over the world and from right here in our backyard of Orange County, CA.  Our Tap Room will have many rotating handles of craft beer and snacks will be at the bar, we promise :)We will hold events like tap take overs, bottle shares, and game nights with food trucks.  We will also host fundraisers and community nights in support of special causes and will partner with many of the local breweries to come up with all sorts of fun stuff to do.  Our Story
Hi, my name is Jeff Amend.  My wife Jena and I are high school sweet
hearts and live in Orange County, California. Our life together has been amazing while discovering what we’re
passionate about.  We have worked very
hard for every penny we’ve earned and are willing to risk everything to make
our dreams come true.  We fell in love in
high school, were married in 2010, and now are very happy to say we are expecting our first baby
in July.
Why We Need Your Support
We have been fortunate enough to raise
money from friends we have met in the craft beer community.  But as you can guess, it costs a lot of $$$
to open the doors of a brand new business. 
We feel this is the perfect platform for us to raise some of the
money we need while spreading the word about who we are and what we’re about.  We will use the funds earned from this
campaign to spark the flame (details below), and the money we can raise from
additional investors who see this will fuel the fire.  Oh, and there are some awesome perks for
those of you who can contribute!!! 
What We Need & What You GetWe’ve set a goal of 40k.  In the unfortunate circumstance that we don’t reach our goal we give you our word that all the perks will be honored.  We will also give updates on our progress and if at the end of our campaign we haven’t raised all the money we hoped for we will state what we plan to do with the funds that we did receive.  Here is how we'll use the money.  

Lease deposit. 
Lawyer fees for trademarking, licensing, construction
      contracts, and investor contracts.
On Sale Beer
      License, Conditional Use Permit. 
Web development fees.  
Graphic designer fees.
Perk costs (what we send to you).

The ImpactThe Orange
     County craft beer community deserves a shop like we plan to open up.  We will create great jobs for the local
     community and plan on opening up more shops down the road.  With the profits we create we will give
     back to the community and hold many events for all to attend that give
     back to the people we serve every day. 
Risks & Challenges
Hitting our goal won’t get us to the finish line.  We hope to raise more than our goal but we will still need to raise additional capital from investors / partners.  Having a successful campaign will push us in the right direction and hopefully catch the eye of potential investors. 

We have overcome many hurdles to get where we are today.  Creating a legitimate business plan, learning the ins-and-outs of running a business, and raising what money we have so far hasn't been easy.  We've heard a lot of ""No"" but every ""No"" get's us closer to a ""Yes!""
Raising enough money to get this shop off the ground is
     no joke.  We understand how difficult it is to contribute your hard earned money in today's world and we don’t take that
     lightly.  We assure you that all the
     money we raise will go straight into this business and we are doing
     everything in our power to make this business successful.

There’s no need for riverbed or flow modifications as is commonly the case with hydropower. The product offers very high efficiency for power generation, with just 1.5 m/s to 2 m/s required water flow and depth starting from 2 m. That means that the water turbine can be used on most rivers in the world. Real-world testing has been performed under the supervision of the professional advisers of the HEP Group, a national electricity company in Croatia. The Department of Hydrodynamics of the Technical Faculty in Rijeka also proved the very high-power yield of the HF solution.

This has been a goal now for about four years. We have all details and plans in place. We've ironed out all the details from product and menus to design and location with city agencies (SBA and city hall), distributors, and financial advisors. Now it's time to fund this dream.

With its blend of locals from the “Harbor of Hospitality”, universities, and nearby military bases, Elizabeth City will make a wonderful home for Turning Gear Café and keep our establishment full of culture and diversity. We’ve formulated a business model that at its roots creates a family friendly artistic atmosphere where coffee lovers and aspiring musicians and artists alike can gather to relax, express, and enjoy everything that is our dream. Your taste buds will be tickled by a café beverage or tea selection from around the world along with locally supplied desserts and wines that flow deliciously with your choice entrée.</p><p>Turning Gear Café is expected to be open for guests’ enjoyment from 6am to 10pm Mondays through Fridays (later on special occasions), and from 10am to 10pm on Saturdays.

We plan on partnering up with surrounding local vendors to support local businesses through marketing and merchandising. To promote environmental awareness and reduce our carbon footprint we have put into place certain processes and improvements such as the daily donation of coffee grounds and other biologically friendly byproducts for use in compost and gardening. In addition, the use of used furniture, recycled products, energy efficient appliances, and LED lighting are just a few more ideas that not only save us money but also reduce waste. We will work with the local colleges and universities and local health departments on continuous process improvements so that we may take this small business family-owned company from good to great.</p><p>Our venues will include nightly themes for example “E.

There will likely be a minimum 2 dollar cover to help support local artists. We will set up an advertising board where the public will be encouraged to post event flyers, items for sale, wanted ads, and other announcements.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nous sommes deux jeunes entrepreneurs récemment diplômés, Adel et Helder. Nous vous proposons un pari fou:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Prouver que nous arriverons à financer notre projet d'auberge de jeunesse dans le centre de Lisbonne sans avoir recours à un prêt bancaire! </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dans cette auberge nous voulons qu'il y ait tout ce nous aimons: Personnel fun et accueillant, atmosphère amicale, grands espaces partagés, activités communes et animations quotidiennes. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Je suis moi-même de Lisbonne et Adel de Lille. Nous nous sommes rencontrés durant nos études à Toulouse. A la fin de nos études nous nous sommes rendus compte que nous n'étions pas faits pour être dans un bureau... Nous avons décidé de quitter nos boulots respectifs et lutter pour la vie que nous rêvions dans une ville que nous aimons. </p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lisbonne, est
une ville coup de cœur. Les festivals et ambiance conviviale, la proximité des plages,
font de Lisbonne une destination de plus en plus prisée des jeunes européens. </p>

</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Au début on a fait la tournée des banques. Un banquier a accepté de nous prêter l'argent pour lancer le projet. Cependant, on s'est rendu compte que pour 100€ prêtés, nous devions en rembourser 135... En somme, pour payer cet emprunt 1/4 de nos revenus annuels partiraient directement à la banque:</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Au lieu de payer des années d'intérêts à la banque, l'argent économisé servira non seulement à financer notre charte d'activité responsable (comme 100% d'énergies renouvelables, investir dans des projets d'économie sociale et solidaire, etc), mais aussi nos engagements envers nos contributeurs (comme les nuits offertes, les 10% de remise à vie, etc). </p>

NOUS ET LE PROJET:

Nous sommes deux jeunes entrepreneurs récemment diplômés, Adel et Helder. Nous vous proposons un pari fou:
Prouver que nous arriverons à financer notre projet d'auberge de jeunesse dans le centre de Lisbonne sans avoir recours à un prêt bancaire! 
Dans cette auberge nous voulons qu'il y ait tout ce nous aimons: Personnel fun et accueillant, atmosphère amicale, grands espaces partagés, activités communes et animations quotidiennes. 
Je suis moi-même de Lisbonne et Adel de Lille. Nous nous sommes rencontrés durant nos études à Toulouse. A la fin de nos études nous nous sommes rendus compte que nous n'étions pas faits pour être dans un bureau... Nous avons décidé de quitter nos boulots respectifs et lutter pour la vie que nous rêvions dans une ville que nous aimons. 

Lisbonne, est
une ville coup de cœur. Les festivals et ambiance conviviale, la proximité des plages,
font de Lisbonne une destination de plus en plus prisée des jeunes européens. 

POURQUOI LE CROWDFUNDING:

Au début on a fait la tournée des banques. Un banquier a accepté de nous prêter l'argent pour lancer le projet. Cependant, on s'est rendu compte que pour 100€ prêtés, nous devions en rembourser 135... En somme, pour payer cet emprunt 1/4 de nos revenus annuels partiraient directement à la banque:


Alors nous avons décidé de lancer notre campagne de crowdfunding:
Au lieu de payer des années d'intérêts à la banque, l'argent économisé servira non seulement à financer notre charte d'activité responsable (comme 100% d'énergies renouvelables, investir dans des projets d'économie sociale et solidaire, etc), mais aussi nos engagements envers nos contributeurs (comme les nuits offertes, les 10% de remise à vie, etc). 

Nous croyons à l'économie sociale et solidaire et aux profits raisonnables.
Nos engagements reflètent nos valeurs et le monde que nous voulons construire, même à notre petite échelle. 

COÛTS RÉELS: 
Pour financer tout le projet sans avoir recours au prêt bancaire nous avons besoin d'un million d'euros:


Achat de l'immeuble: 600 000€
Achat de licences et coûts administratives: 100 000€
Restauration de l'immeuble: 300 000 €
Coûts inhérents au site de Crowdfunding: 9% du montant levé.

Nous sommes conscients qu'arriver à cette somme est un énorme défi. 
Quoi qu'il arrive, l'Arty Hostel verra le jour, nous avons l'accord de la banque,  mais si on peut éviter un maximum de frais bancaires tout en proposant des super contreparties à nos clients, nous le ferons.

Nous préférons choyer nos clients que donner de l'argent aux banques et entretenir un système que nous ne cautionnons pas. 

Si vous, comme nous, croyez qu'une autre façon de financer vos rêves est possible, participez et partagez ce crowdfunding grâce aux outils Indiegogo! 
Le partage est la seule façon d'atteindre l'objectif que nous nos sommes fixé. Nous comptons sur votre aide et espérons vous voir très prochainement à Arty Hostel.

OUVERTURE PRÉVUE EN AOÛT 2015!
 Aidez nous à rendre notre banquier fou!!!!

WE AND THE PROJECT:
We are two recently graduated young entrepreneurs, Adel and Helder. We are making you a mad bet: 
Prove that we can fund our hostel in Lisbon’s downtown without a bank loan!
This hostel will be a compilation of everything we love: welcoming and funny staff, a friendly atmosphere, large shared areas, shared activities and a lot of hustle and bustle.

I'm from Lisbon, Portugal and Adel from Lille, France, we met during our studies at Toulouse. At the end of our studies, we both realised that we didn't want to be stuck in an office for the rest of our life... So we quitted ours jobs and decided to live the life we have always dreamed of in a city we both love! 

Lisbon is the kind of city you could fall in
love with very easily. There are lots of festivals, a friendly atmosphere and the
beaches are really close. As a matter of fact the city has turned to be one of
the most popular destinations for young European people.

WHY CROWDFUNDING:

At the
beginning we visited some banks. One bank manager accepted to loan us the credit to do the project. But then, we realised that if we borrowed €100, we would have to pay
back €135... Meaning that 1/4 of your benefits would go straight to the bank:

So we have decided to launch the crowdfunding:
Instead of paying years of bank interests, the money we could save thanks to your donations will not only be used to fund our commitments (such as 100% renewable energies, investing in other Crowdfunding projects, etc), but also our commitments towards our donators ( such as free overnight stays, 10% life time discount, etc).

We do believe in responsible economy and reasonable profits. 
Our commitments reflect our values and the world we want to live in.

REAL COSTS:
To finance the entire project without a bank loan we need 1 million euros:




Purchase of the building: €600,000


Purchase of the license, solicitor
and administrative costs: €100,000


Restoration of the building (we want
to help restoring Lisbon): €300,000


Cost of the Crowdfunding site: 9% of the total amount of the funds raised



We do realise that reaching this goal it will be very difficult. 
Whatever happens, Arty Hostel will be launched, our bank can loan us the money, but if we can avoid bank charges while giving our customers great offers we will go for it.



In any case, Arty
Hostel will see the light of day. It will be much faster and easier thanks to
you, and you will enjoy unique advantages!

If you believe that another way to fund your dreams is possible, please share this page thanks to Indiegogo tools! 
Sharing is the best way to reach the goal we target, so we are counting on your help, and we hope to see you in a very near future at ARTY HOSTEL!

<p>We still need to furnish our installations better, by adding a cover to the soil to prevent dust from settling on the plants, and sealing our greenhouses to minimize insects.</p>

<p><b>Antigua Guatemala</b></p>
<p>It was the capital of the Captaincy-General of Guatemala in the early
16th century. The city was built on a grid pattern inspired by the italian
renaissance, and the buildings continue to exhibit the traditional colonial
look of the era. The city was prone to flooding and earthquakes, which prompted
many to move the capital to the actual Guatemala City.  Many stayed behind and it was referred to as
""La Antigua Guatemala"" (The old Guatemala). Today the city is a
hotspot for restaurants, hotels, spanish schools and local shops. It is
considered a romantic and wedding destination.</p>
<p>One generous donor will get to visit us and stay for three nights in this charming town.  <b>Since we can't offer you air travel according to IndieGogo terms, you'll have to arrange that on your own</b>, to Guatemala's La Aurora Airport, but once you arrive, we will take care of you like a VIP.</p>

<h3>Cuanto hemos avanzado y que tenemos?</h3>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Iniciamos producción en noviembre de 2014 con el valor fundamental de la sostenibilidad y actualmente tenemos un invernadero de prueba. 6 invernaderos parcialmente ensamblados, 16 sistemas NFT (agua en tubo donde crecen las plantas), un camión de entregas y una oficina sencilla. Ya tenemos clientes, pero no podemos tener más clientes al menos que podamos producir mas vegetales.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1220863/files/20150214020309-IMG_4281.jpg?1423908189"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Todavía tenemos que mejorar nuestras instalaciones, proporcionando un cobertor del suelo para prevenir que el polvo caiga en las plantas, y sellando nuestros invernaderos para evitar insectos al máximo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1220857/files/20150214015948-DSC_0567.JPG?1423907988"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Conforme fuimos incrementando producción, optamos por la compra de un camion pequeño marca KIA K2700 para entregas. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1220828/files/20150214014855-IMG_3023.jpg?1423907335"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Ahora tenemos una instalación mucho mas decente (incluyendo las decoraciones del día de San Valentín). Esta oficina será re-ubicada a nuestro nuevo sitio de producción en Junio.  (en estos momentos ya estamos trasladándonos)</p>

<p>Este invernadero es alquilado.  No es ideal para cultivo hidropónico debido al pequeño tamaño.  Pero podemos producir adecuadamente para mientras.</p>

<p>Fue la capital de la Capitanía general de Guatemala a inicios del siglo 16. La ciudad fue construida en un patrón cuadriculado inspirado por el renacimiento italiano, y los edificios continuan exhibiendo su origen colonial. La ciudad solía inundarse mucho y sufría de terremotos con frecuencia, lo cual estimuló a varios a pasarse a la capital actual. Muchos se quedaron atras y se renombró ""Antigua Guatemala"" (The old Guatemala). La ciudad es hoy un centro popular para restaurantes, hoteles, academias de español, y tiendas locales. Se le considera un destino romántico para parejas y bodas.</p>

</div></div>","At Fogliasana, our aim is to feed our consumers with produce that is clean, convenient, and has been produced with an efficient use of our natural resources.  (Para leer en español, ver más abajo)It is important for everyone to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from so they can make sustainable choices. 


Traditional agriculture uses between 50% and 70% of the world´s freshwater sources. 

At Fogliasana, we are committed to a responsible use of our water and have chosen hydroponic crop production which uses between 10% to 20% the amount of water that traditional agriculture consumes. FAO Water Withdrawal InfographicPopulation increase to 9 billion people by 2050 is driving demand for food... on less farmland!This is placing pressure on water systems and soil quality and quantity worldwide. We want to provide food choices that are right for consumers and their children and believe that produce is part of a healthy diet. We have chosen green leafy vegetables as our main product. ""Feeding 9 Billion""""Inside the looming food crisis"".
Your donation will help us accomplish our dream of making our startup hydroponic farm more sustainable.  
Help us finish setting up our new greenhouses with hydroponic irrigation systems, a rainwater capture system and solar panels to generate our own electricity.

How far ahead are we and what do we have?


We began production in November 2014 with the core value of sustainability and currently have one test greenhouse, 6 partially assembled greenhouses, 16 portable locally designed NFT systems, one used delivery truck, and a simple office. We have some customers right now, but we cannot have more customers unless we can produce more vegetables.


We still need to furnish our installations better, by adding a cover to the soil to prevent dust from settling on the plants, and sealing our greenhouses to minimize insects.

As we began production, we opted to purchase a small used KIA K2700 truck for deliveries. 

Our first office space consisted of this empty plastic fertilizer bag.

Now we have a much more decent installation (including decorations for valentine's day). This office will be relocated to our new production site in early June.

This greenhouse is rented.  It is not ideal for hydroponics due to the low height, but we have managed to produce adequately enough in it.

What To Do In Antigua Guatemala - The New York Times


Antigua Guatemala
It was the capital of the Captaincy-General of Guatemala in the early
16th century. The city was built on a grid pattern inspired by the italian
renaissance, and the buildings continue to exhibit the traditional colonial
look of the era. The city was prone to flooding and earthquakes, which prompted
many to move the capital to the actual Guatemala City.  Many stayed behind and it was referred to as
""La Antigua Guatemala"" (The old Guatemala). Today the city is a
hotspot for restaurants, hotels, spanish schools and local shops. It is
considered a romantic and wedding destination.
One generous donor will get to visit us and stay for three nights in this charming town.  Since we can't offer you air travel according to IndieGogo terms, you'll have to arrange that on your own, to Guatemala's La Aurora Airport, but once you arrive, we will take care of you like a VIP.
DAY 1 - Arrival

We'll pick you up at La Aurora International Airport for your 40 minute drive to Antigua.
Check in to your hotel
Get a relaxing massage at Prana Holistic Center

DAY 2 - Visit the farm

What happens if we don't reach our goal?



If
we do not reach our entire goal, the funds will be allocated in the following order:

Greenhouse installation
NFT
     system installation
Water
     filtration system
Solar
     panel and pumping system
Office
     and packing room
Insurance
     for staff
Certifications

Our farm will continue to operate, but our growth will not be as fast or steady to keep up with fund needs.

ESPAÑOL
En Fogliasana, nuestro objetivo es alimentar a nuestros consumidores con productos limpios, convenientes y que han sido cultivados con un uso eficiente de nuestros recursos naturales.Para todos y cada uno de nosotros es importante saber como se ha producido su comida y de donde viene para poder tomar decisiones sostenibles.
La agricultura tradicional utiliza entre 50% y 70% de las fuentes de agua fresca del mundo. 

En Fogliasana, estamos comprometidos a utilizar responsablemente el agua, y por eso hemos elegido la producción hidropónica, la cual utiliza entre 10% y 20% de la cantidad de agua que normalmente se utilizaría con métodos tradicionales. Infográfica de la FAO sobre uso del agua frescaEl crecimiento poblacional hacia 9 millardos de personas para el año 2050 esta impactando la demanda por alimentos frescos... en menos espacio para sembrar!Esto esta presionando los sistemas acuíferos del planeta, así como la calidad y cantidad de suelo disponible. Queremos proveer opciones de alimentos que sean adecuados para nuestros clientes y sus hijos, y creemos que los vegetales y las frutas son parte importante de una dieta saludable. Hemos elegido vegetales de hoja verde como nuestro producto principal.""Alimentando 9 Millardos (Artículo de la National Geographic en inglés)""""Dentro de la crisis alimentaria"".
Tu donación nos ayudara a cumplir nuestro sueño de hacer nuestra finca hidropónica un modelo de sustentabilidad.  
Ayudanos a terminar nuestros nuevos invernaderos con sistemas hidropónicos, un sistema de captura de agua de lluvia, y paneles solares con sistemas de almacenamiento para generar nuestra propia electricidad.

Cuanto hemos avanzado y que tenemos?


Iniciamos producción en noviembre de 2014 con el valor fundamental de la sostenibilidad y actualmente tenemos un invernadero de prueba. 6 invernaderos parcialmente ensamblados, 16 sistemas NFT (agua en tubo donde crecen las plantas), un camión de entregas y una oficina sencilla. Ya tenemos clientes, pero no podemos tener más clientes al menos que podamos producir mas vegetales.


Todavía tenemos que mejorar nuestras instalaciones, proporcionando un cobertor del suelo para prevenir que el polvo caiga en las plantas, y sellando nuestros invernaderos para evitar insectos al máximo.

Conforme fuimos incrementando producción, optamos por la compra de un camion pequeño marca KIA K2700 para entregas. 

Nuestra primer oficina consistió en esta bolsa usada de que contenía fertilizante. (Costal)

Ahora tenemos una instalación mucho mas decente (incluyendo las decoraciones del día de San Valentín). Esta oficina será re-ubicada a nuestro nuevo sitio de producción en Junio.  (en estos momentos ya estamos trasladándonos)

Este invernadero es alquilado.  No es ideal para cultivo hidropónico debido al pequeño tamaño.  Pero podemos producir adecuadamente para mientras.

La ciudad solía inundarse mucho y sufría de terremotos con frecuencia, lo cual estimuló a varios a pasarse a la capital actual. Muchos se quedaron atras y se renombró ""Antigua Guatemala"" (The old Guatemala). La ciudad es hoy un centro popular para restaurantes, hoteles, academias de español, y tiendas locales. Se le considera un destino romántico para parejas y bodas.
Un donante generoso (o más!) pueden visitar nuestro proyecto por un día y poder alojarse en esta fantástica ciudad colonial.

together existing trail sections. Meanwhile, we continue to work towards the

We have worked closely with landowners and environmental regulators to make a sustainable, useful and beautiful design. Engineering blueprints are being finalized. If it were just a matter of elbow grease, we'd be out there right now making it happen. But there is no way around the fact that this one is going to cost money - because of the need for heavily engineered and professionally built structures ""threading the needle"" between a busy highway, a broad river, and steep valley walls. The metal alone in the bridge will cost well over $100,000.The good news is we have secured 90% of the funding needed - but these are mostly challenge grants which need to be matched by local or non-government donations in order to be released and used to build the trail.  Your donation will make a real difference.
Over the past 15 years our experienced trail building staff and committed volunteer members have helped to create and care for many miles of new trail. Our accomplishments have ranged in size from teaching a first grade class to restore native plants along an eroded river all the way up to administering the 1/2 million dollar construction of a new trail underpass beneath an interstate highway. Now we are capable, ready and fired up to be carrying out our biggest project ever.

The only thing standing in the way is this final fundraising hurdle.

<h3><b>How
It All Began</b></h3>
<p>Three years ago, Roberto Catanuso,
General Manager and Mounir Elhilali, Executive Chef, combined culinary
experiences to launch a crêperie food truck serving made-from-scratch, savory
and sweet, authentic French crêpes. The Crêpes Parfait team prides itself on
being environmentally responsible— our
crêpes are made daily, using only all-natural and organic (whenever possible)
ingredients and <i>ONLY</i> serve products
using recyclable and biodegradable paper and plastic products. The use of Styrofoam (technically known as polystyrene foam)
is strictly prohibited. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442541808/dfxgwa3hlygzxx0m3uz9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We set our Crêpes Parfait food truck

<p>Several of our clients have requested

<h3>UBC Students for Climate Action</h3>

<p>We believe that students –
especially those privileged enough to live in Vancouver and attend university –
have a responsibility to play a major role in cultural change as well as
national policy in regards to inequality, current international policies, and
most urgently, domestic policies regarding climate change. In light of this, we
have organized a coalition of student organizations at UBC. This coalition
includes environmental groups, humanitarian groups. and research groups.</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>We
hope to create a movement on the UBC campus that will steer the climate
conversation to become more concerned with tactics of addressing the alarming
matter while conversing with and informing students about the reality and size
of the problem; the reality of climate change should be widely accepted on an
academic campus and so should its serious implications. Students and professors
should be utilizing their diverse academic disciplines – physics, economics,
social theory, behavioral evolution – to argue tactics. We hope to create an
environment where political discourse is not limited to the few students that
choose to participate, that instead, through joint action, participation is
exciting, enjoyable and popular, so that these kinds of topics will become
prevalent in the everyday conversation of students.</p>

We believe that this movement can have a meaningful impact
on student votes and turnout in the upcoming election; Because of this, and in
light of the the UN conference on climate change in Paris, we have organized a
pre-election campaign. For the winter semester, we have a series of creative
social events that will allow for serious conversation on how to address
climate change. For increasing conversation and accessible information we have
organized student-to-student seminars and teach-ins. We also plan to utilize
the arts through spoken word poetry, live student written music, impromptu
choirs, collaborative paintings (with 1300+ contributors), and many more
activities intended to bring students together through art while addressing and
being active about important issues and problems. At all our events, we are
going to promote students to vote and present them with the platforms of the
Canadian parties. We  will end with a
large theatrical production called ‘Climate Change Game’.

</div><p> </p><h3>The Ride Across Canada 

</h3><p><i>***Please note***  The BC Campaign is being launched now and has not been launched previously to cover the expenses of The Ride throughout the Province of BC.  Fundraising events were held on Vancouver Island, in Langley, Princeton, Summerland and Armstrong.  Pre-Ride Fundraisers were held in Quesnel, Williams Lake, 100 Mile, Chilliwack, Nanaimo, and Ladysmith.  These events assisted with the asset purchases and initial ride costs to start the Ride.  The rest of the expenses for BC need your help and we need your help to keep the Ride moving.  Thank you for considering helping us cover costs we've already incurred.  <br/></i></p><p><i>***Please continue reading for our story***</i><br/></p><p><b><i>My name is Paul Nichols and I am a 46-year-old Canadian veteran.</i></b>
</p><p>I realized the power of a
heartfelt story when I was in Vancouver and a woman in a shop saw the Regimental
crest on my jacket and told me her story. 
</p><p>As we talked, she cried and hugged me, and the people in line behind 
me had tears in their eyes.  We all listened to her tell the story of 
living
through the siege of Sarajevo.  For two years, she and the people with 
her were near starvation
and dodged daily sniper fire. <i> It was Canadian troops who saved their lives
and eventually got her out.</i></p>
<p>I am proud to be a former
Calgary Highlander who served with 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry during the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia in 1993. When our
first daughter was born, I left the military and my wife and I returned to our
small town of Quesnel, in central B.C. Together with our daughters, we run a farm and riding
center, and our farm is certified through both the British Columbia Therapeutic
Riding Association and the Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association.</p>
<p>When I left the Calgary
Highlanders, I left the brotherhood and my support network.  As a veteran
who has been under fire and struggled to make the transition to civilian
life, I know how lonely it can be making a home in a community that
doesn’t recognize a contemporary veteran. I stopped telling my stories and then
began to spend a lot of time inside my own head wondering if my service had
been worthwhile. 
</p><p>My own journey included my dog, my horse and a lot of
time alone on the river with a fly rod. <i>Ultimately, it was the
Bosnian woman in the shop who took the time to share her story that
changed my life, and I am a different person today because of her.</i></p>
<p>Several  years ago, I
returned to the military as a Canadian Ranger and, under the
supervision of BC Coy 4 CRPG, I took on the creation of a basic horsemanship
course/exercise.  Dozens of Canadian Rangers and Regular Army have been
through this training, and we have developed some proficient, confident riders. 
</p><p>One evening around the fire, we were discussing the day's ride and one of the
Patricia’s asked what our Post Traumatic Stress Disorder treatment program
looked like. This is when we realized that we were uniquely suited to make a
difference, and it was the beginning of an idea. </p>
<p>My wife and I have
assembled a crew, and we have stepped off, as of April 13, 2015, from Victoria, B.C., and we are
leading a horseback relay across Canada.  My wife leads an advance party
with trucks, trailers, several horses and a small crew, and she co-ordinates
with communities to find our veterans who will then be given a riding lesson. 
</p><p>Once they are safely through her lesson, these veterans will be staged to take
their place to join the ride with me as we pass
through, or close to, their own communities.  
</p><p>As I travel across the
country on horseback accompanied by these other riders, our team will document their
stories, which will then be organized and shared with the people of Canada. 

</p><p><b><i>Our objective is to make it across Canada in 211 days and include as many
veteran guest riders as we can. </i></b>
</p><p><b><i>***We left Victoria on April 13th and we are currently on the BC/Alberta border.  We wanted to have a video to go along with the campaign, so the BC portion is being launched now.  We hope you choose to help us regain some of our expenses passing through BC by sponsoring a portion of the Ride.***</i></b><br/></p><p>This ride is not about one veteran and his
family riding across the country for a cause. By the time our horses get us to
the Atlantic coast, we will have been joined by and have heard the stories of
over <b>700 Canadian Veterans.  </b>
</p><p>As these stories are collected and reflected
on, we will create awareness and encourage discussion of the challenges
that our service men and women face as they transition back into the world of
civilians. 
</p><p>The Canadian people love their troops and our communities will
support them, but often times they don't know who they are after they clear out of
the military.  By educating our communities and raising awareness to the
changing face of their veterans, we can give them the
opportunity to truly support their troops. 
</p><p>We believe that this
timely help from the communities that they have served will lower the
incidence of PTSD and family breakup, and I personally know that timely
help can change a life. </p>

register to ride, go to: <a href=""http://www.communitiesforveterans.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.communitiesforveterans.com</a> or visit us on Facebook at <b>Communities For Veterans, The Ride
Across Canada.</b></p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Overall,
 it will take over $550,000 to fund the entire ride across the country. 
 We are developing a plan of events and fundraisers that will assist 
with the costs as we make our way through the cities and towns from 
Victoria to St. John's.  This campaign is meant to give us a starting 
point and help cover the following initial costs:

 </p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Beyond sharing the stories
 of veterans, we will discover survivors - people who have lived through
 the missions our troops have been deployed to and have found refuge in 
Canada - and share their stories.  
</p><p>We want to educate our children.  We want to give them knowledge of current events and the impact our troops continue to make.  
</p><p>This initiative isn't about whether war is good or bad.  It isn't an 
initiative about right or wrong.  It is about what we can do as a 
country to help welcome our troops back from wherever the government 
sends them and help them to live a healthy and safe life in the country 
they chose to stand up for.</p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Some people say that 
the best way to overcome PTSD is to not talk about it.  To bury it and 
""just get on with your life"".  I disagree.  I am a veteran and I 
overcame my issues returning to civilian life by finally talking about 
it and allowing a survivor to tell me their story and realizing the 
impact Canadian Troops made on her life. 
</p><p>Our horses: 

</p>
<p><b><u>Is
this bad for the horses? </u></b></p>
<p>No. Our horses are very well cared for. They are on a vet-approved diet
and are monitored daily for good health. We are way below limits set by Equine
Canada for daily distance to travel. We have 4 extra horses so that horses are
rotated for days off and extra rest days if required. We are traveling with 8
horses, and only 4 horses will be used for the main ride at a time. The horses
will have regular vet checks and farrier checks, and their well-being is a priority
in this ride.

***Please note***  The BC Campaign is being launched now and has not been launched previously to cover the expenses of The Ride throughout the Province of BC.  Fundraising events were held on Vancouver Island, in Langley, Princeton, Summerland and Armstrong.  Pre-Ride Fundraisers were held in Quesnel, Williams Lake, 100 Mile, Chilliwack, Nanaimo, and Ladysmith.  These events assisted with the asset purchases and initial ride costs to start the Ride.  The rest of the expenses for BC need your help and we need your help to keep the Ride moving.  Thank you for considering helping us cover costs we've already incurred.  ***Please continue reading for our story***My name is Paul Nichols and I am a 46-year-old Canadian veteran.
I realized the power of a
heartfelt story when I was in Vancouver and a woman in a shop saw the Regimental
crest on my jacket and told me her story. 
As we talked, she cried and hugged me, and the people in line behind 
me had tears in their eyes.  We all listened to her tell the story of 
living
through the siege of Sarajevo.  For two years, she and the people with 
her were near starvation
and dodged daily sniper fire.  It was Canadian troops who saved their lives
and eventually got her out.
I am proud to be a former
Calgary Highlander who served with 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry during the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia in 1993. When our
first daughter was born, I left the military and my wife and I returned to our
small town of Quesnel, in central B.C. Together with our daughters, we run a farm and riding
center, and our farm is certified through both the British Columbia Therapeutic
Riding Association and the Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association.
When I left the Calgary
Highlanders, I left the brotherhood and my support network.  As a veteran
who has been under fire and struggled to make the transition to civilian
life, I know how lonely it can be making a home in a community that
doesn’t recognize a contemporary veteran. I stopped telling my stories and then
began to spend a lot of time inside my own head wondering if my service had
been worthwhile. 
My own journey included my dog, my horse and a lot of
time alone on the river with a fly rod. Ultimately, it was the
Bosnian woman in the shop who took the time to share her story that
changed my life, and I am a different person today because of her.
Several  years ago, I
returned to the military as a Canadian Ranger and, under the
supervision of BC Coy 4 CRPG, I took on the creation of a basic horsemanship
course/exercise.  Dozens of Canadian Rangers and Regular Army have been
through this training, and we have developed some proficient, confident riders. 
One evening around the fire, we were discussing the day's ride and one of the
Patricia’s asked what our Post Traumatic Stress Disorder treatment program
looked like. This is when we realized that we were uniquely suited to make a
difference, and it was the beginning of an idea. 
My wife and I have
assembled a crew, and we have stepped off, as of April 13, 2015, from Victoria, B.C., and we are
leading a horseback relay across Canada.  My wife leads an advance party
with trucks, trailers, several horses and a small crew, and she co-ordinates
with communities to find our veterans who will then be given a riding lesson. 
Once they are safely through her lesson, these veterans will be staged to take
their place to join the ride with me as we pass
through, or close to, their own communities.  
As I travel across the
country on horseback accompanied by these other riders, our team will document their
stories, which will then be organized and shared with the people of Canada. 

Our objective is to make it across Canada in 211 days and include as many
veteran guest riders as we can. 
***We left Victoria on April 13th and we are currently on the BC/Alberta border.  We wanted to have a video to go along with the campaign, so the BC portion is being launched now.  We hope you choose to help us regain some of our expenses passing through BC by sponsoring a portion of the Ride.***This ride is not about one veteran and his
family riding across the country for a cause. By the time our horses get us to
the Atlantic coast, we will have been joined by and have heard the stories of
over 700 Canadian Veterans.  
As these stories are collected and reflected
on, we will create awareness and encourage discussion of the challenges
that our service men and women face as they transition back into the world of
civilians. 
The Canadian people love their troops and our communities will
support them, but often times they don't know who they are after they clear out of
the military.  By educating our communities and raising awareness to the
changing face of their veterans, we can give them the
opportunity to truly support their troops. 
We believe that this
timely help from the communities that they have served will lower the
incidence of PTSD and family breakup, and I personally know that timely
help can change a life.

register to ride, go to: www.communitiesforveterans.com or visit us on Facebook at Communities For Veterans, The Ride
Across Canada.
  What We Need & What You Get Overall,
 it will take over $550,000 to fund the entire ride across the country. 
 We are developing a plan of events and fundraisers that will assist 
with the costs as we make our way through the cities and towns from 
Victoria to St. John's.  This campaign is meant to give us a starting 
point and help cover the following initial costs:

<div>
<p>The Festival for Solidarity
and Cooperative Economy invites you to the second pre-festival event of Solidarity,
Creativity, and Sustainability, that is going to take place at the open Project
<b>Spithari – Waking Life</b>, located in
Marathon Town, <b>from 12<sup>th</sup> till
14<sup>th</sup> of June 2015</b>.</p>
<p>Following the last years successful pre-festival in the self-managed
camping of Voula, this year's event is moving from the acquired theory to
practice, focusing on promoting the eco-community based living and exchanging
practices, technical know-how and further insights.  Through workshops and alongside with artistic
improvisations, it will help us come closer to ourselves and consequently to
one another while spending a nice three-day event.</p>
<p>During these days, we will have the chance to learn and create
whatever is conducive to the growth of self-sufficiency, aiming at the same
time to help the current projects move forward and encourage the creation of
future sustainable places. <br/>
We ask for your support and participation in order to move all together faster,
to a different kind of society, based on solidarity, co-operation and environmentally-friendly
technology, aiming at the same time towards self-sufficiency.<br/>
We know we are not working alone for this vision and thus we believe we shall
not be alone in this attempt.</p>
<p>In case you want to implement a workshop, offer voluntary
service or for further information, go to: </p>
<p><a href=""https://trello.com/festival4sce"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>https://trello.com/festival4sce</span></b></a>  or send us an e-mail to <a href=""mailto:festival.economicsolidarity@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>festival.economicsolidarity@gmail.com</span></b></a></p>
<p>We have chosen the open
project Spithari-Waking Life as the hosting place during this three-day event,
since we believe that by having it improved, we will be giving ourselves a
chance to learn and create a sustainable and self-sufficient place for
everybody. </p>
<p>We want to see the open project Spithari-Waking Life
evolving and moving forward in the path of solidarity with the destination of
self-sufficiency. We envision it as a space of technology experimentation
relating to eco-community living, that could support any future project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our campaign's goal is to collect the money we need to buy all the necesssary materials for the workshops that will take place.</p>
<p>The most important workshop is the creation of a natural pond (water collection).</p>
<p>This workshop will help Spithari Waking Life to solve the problem of water, manage to have all the water supplies it needs and be sustainable.</p>
<p><b>We invite eco communities, similar projects, collectives and initiatives to support our effort, share our campaign and stand by us as we stand by them.</b></p>
<p>Solidarity is the Solution!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary - Μικρή Περίληψη

The Festival for Solidarity
and Cooperative Economy invites you to the second pre-festival event of Solidarity,
Creativity, and Sustainability, that is going to take place at the open Project
Spithari – Waking Life, located in
Marathon Town, from 12th till
14th of June 2015.
Following the last years successful pre-festival in the self-managed
camping of Voula, this year's event is moving from the acquired theory to
practice, focusing on promoting the eco-community based living and exchanging
practices, technical know-how and further insights.  Through workshops and alongside with artistic
improvisations, it will help us come closer to ourselves and consequently to
one another while spending a nice three-day event.
During these days, we will have the chance to learn and create
whatever is conducive to the growth of self-sufficiency, aiming at the same
time to help the current projects move forward and encourage the creation of
future sustainable places. 
We ask for your support and participation in order to move all together faster,
to a different kind of society, based on solidarity, co-operation and environmentally-friendly
technology, aiming at the same time towards self-sufficiency.
We know we are not working alone for this vision and thus we believe we shall
not be alone in this attempt.
In case you want to implement a workshop, offer voluntary
service or for further information, go to: 
https://trello.com/festival4sce  or send us an e-mail to festival.economicsolidarity@gmail.com
We have chosen the open
project Spithari-Waking Life as the hosting place during this three-day event,
since we believe that by having it improved, we will be giving ourselves a
chance to learn and create a sustainable and self-sufficient place for
everybody. 
We want to see the open project Spithari-Waking Life
evolving and moving forward in the path of solidarity with the destination of
self-sufficiency. We envision it as a space of technology experimentation
relating to eco-community living, that could support any future project.

Our campaign's goal is to collect the money we need to buy all the necesssary materials for the workshops that will take place.
The most important workshop is the creation of a natural pond (water collection).
This workshop will help Spithari Waking Life to solve the problem of water, manage to have all the water supplies it needs and be sustainable.
We invite eco communities, similar projects, collectives and initiatives to support our effort, share our campaign and stand by us as we stand by them.
Solidarity is the Solution!

 Στις 12, 13 και 14 του Ιούνη το Φεστιβάλ Αλληλέγγυας και Συνεργατικής Οικονομίας περνά στη πράξη. Το προ-φεστιβάλ του Καλοκαιριού θα διοργανωθεί στο Ανοικτό Εγχείρημα ΣΠΙΘΑΡΙ-WAKING LIFE στον Μαραθώνα και θα επικεντρωθεί στον οικοκοινοτισμό. Σκοπός του προ-φεστιβάλ είναι η δικτύωση των οικοκοινοτήτων και παρόμοιων εγχειρημάτων μέσα από ανταλλαγή γνώσης, πρακτικά εργαστήρια σχετικά με την αυτάρκεια αλλά και μέσα από τις τέχνες με στόχο να έρθουμε πιο κοντά και να περάσουμε ένα όμορφο τριήμερο.Θέλουμε το φετινό προ-φεστιβάλ σε συνεργασία με την ομάδα Σπιθάρι waking life  να δημιουγήσει τις συνθήκες για να εφαρμοστούν πειραματικά τεχνολογίες που αφορούν τον Οικοκοινοτισμό, ώστε να υποστηριχτεί πρακτικά όποιο εγχείρημα. Οι τεχνολογίες που θα προκύψουν από το προ-φεστιβάλ θα δωθούν σε κοινότητες και εγχειρήματα που τα έχουν ανάγκη.
Η καμπάνια μας έχει σαν στόχο να μαζευτούν εκείνοι οι χρηματικοί πόροι που θα χρειαστούμε προκειμένου να αγοραστούν τα υλικά για τα εργαστήρια που θα πραματοποιηθούν. Κάποια από τα εργαστήρια, όπως π.χ η δημιουργία φυσικής λίμνης- ταμιευτήρα νερού, θα βοηθήσουν ουσιαστικά το Σπιθάρι να προχωρήσει ένα βήμα πιο κοντά στην αυτάρκεια.
Καλούμε όλες τις οικοκοινότητες και παρόμοια εγχειρήματα, συλλογικές αντίστοιχες προσπάθειες,αλλά και άτομα να στηρίξουν την προσπάθεια μας και να σταθούν δίπλα μας. Γνωρίζουμε πως δεν είμαστε μόνοι σε αυτό το όραμα και άρα πιστεύουμε πως δεν θα είμαστε μόνοι σε αυτή την προσπάθεια.
Κάθε βοήθεια, κάθε συμμετοχή είναι πολύτιμη!
Αν δεν μπορείτε να μας στηρίξετε με χρήματα, διαδώστε την καμπάνια μας μέσω facebook, twitter και e-mail.
Η αλληλεγγύη είναι η λύση!
   What We Need & What You Get  Έχουμε προυπολογίσει ότι οι πόροι που χρειάζονται για να μπορέσει το Σπιθάρι να εξελιχτεί και να αποτελέσει ένα χώρο ανοικτό, προσβάσιμο και βολικό σε όλους είναι 3000 ευρώ.
Η ανταπόδοση μας είναι τα καταπληκτικά μας perks που περιλαμβάνουν μπλουζάκια, φαγητό στο αυτοδιαχειριζόμενο καφενείο Ακαδημίας Πλάτωνος, την υπέροχη μας τζιτζιμπύρα, διαμονή στο Σπιθάρι κλπ.
Σε περίπτωση που δεν καταφέρουμε να φτάσουμε το ποσό που θέτουμε ως στόχο θα διαθέσουμε όποια χρήματα έχουν μαζευτεί για να λύσουμε το πρόβλημα παροχής νερού στο χώρο.    The Impact Θεωρούμε την υποστήριξή που θα μας δώσετε εξαιρετικά σημαντική, ώστε να δημιουργηθεί ένας χώρος προσβάσιμος σε όλους, και στον οποίο θα μπορεί κάποιος να μείνει για καιρό. Όποιος το επιθυμεί θα μπορεί να μας βοηθήσει στην παραπέρα εξέλιξη του χώρου αλλά και να υλοποιήσει όποιο project οραματίζεται στα πλαίσια της Βιωσιμότητας,της Αυτάρκειας και της Αυτοδιαχείρησης της ζωής μας (Διατροφή, Ενέργεια, Υγεία).

Risks & Challenges Στην πορεία υλοποίησης και ολοκλήρωσης του project πιστεύουμε ότι θα εμφανιστούν δυσκολίες που όμως θεωρούμε πως μπορούν να λυθούν με την ενεργή συμμετοχή νέων ανθρώπων οι οποίοι θα φέρουν φρέσκιες ιδέες, γνώσεις και θετική ενέργεια.
Για αυτό ζητάμε και τη συμμετοχή σου ανεξάρτητα από την οικονομική σου υποστήριξη.
    Other Ways You Can Help Θα μας είναι πολύτιμη η βοήθεια σου όσον αφορά τη διαδωση αυτής της καμπάνιας ώστε να φτάσει σε όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερους.

</h3>
<p>We are a group of friends really passionate about Africa. Some of us worked there before and shared the joy of making little kids smile with the rest of us. And now, here we are! Even though we come from different backgrounds (corporate, students, interpreters, IT, architecture, pharmacy) this time we have a common goal. <br/></p>
<p>We want to drive from Kenya to Namibia in 40 days and spread smiles along the way by giving away as many frisbees and footballs as we can carry to the children we meet. <br/></p>
<p>Also, we want to help the <a href=""http://www.nomadsportsacademy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nomad Sports Academy</a> in Zambia  by providing them a mean of transportation that will be used for the orphans and underprivileged kids there.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order for all this to happen, we need to buy a van in Kenya, that we'll customize and paint to fit the purpose! <br/></p>
<p>The cost of the van would be around $5000, so your help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>We already bought our plane tickets and we'll get there on the 28th of July, so for us there's no way back! One way or another, we are going to make this happen!</p>
<p>In return for your contribution, you will receive a <i>unique travel guide</i> that we'll compose in our journey!</p>
<p>In case our goal is not reached, we will use whatever funds are in, to partially cover the cost of the van. We would probably borrow the rest of the money! We hope that's not gonna be the case! :)<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>Little kids do not understand politics or economy, nor do they care. Their daily purpose is to be happy, to laugh, to play. While I was working in D.R.C. I would always see children playing soccer with a ball made of some sort of cloths or herbs. Every time they saw a real soccer ball, their enthusiasm would sky-rocket! <br/>For most of us, playing soccer with a normal ball is common sense, but not for them. <br/></p>
<p>That's why we think that we would be able to bring a smile on so many children's faces with this sort of simple things, and you can be part of it.</p>
<p>In the same spirit, we chose <b><a href=""http://www.nomadsportsacademy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nomad Sports Academy</a></b> as the beneficiary of the van, because the amazing sports talent that so many kids there have, needs to be nourished and helped to develop.</p>
<p>All the money we raised ourselves so far, will be used to make small differences in the communities we'll encounter along the road.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Throughout this journey, we will sleep in campings and in the midst of local villages in order to keep everything low-cost. The main challenge is gonna be to keep ourselves safe and healthy, and also to keep the van running.<br/></p>

I will prepare items like appetizers, stocks, soups, small meals, muffins, cookie dough, pie crusts, cakes, preserves, pickles, baby food... All as local as possible, all made with <i>real ingredients</i> that I'll list on the labels, and all delicious. Orders can be placed for any product. Specials will be offered, and you'll always be able to pop in and find something new! Fond will also be a small venue for <i><u><b>private 5-course dinners</b></u></i> and <i><u><b>cooking classes</b></u></i>. The dinners will be offered on most Fridays and Saturdays throughout the year at 7 PM, and they will be by invitation only. <i>Anyone</i> can attend, and all you'll have to do is request seats for a particular menu that I have posted. The menus will change weekly, and I will offer special meals that cater to vegetarianism, veganism, and Kosher laws. Customers will also be able to rent out the entire table for a <b><i>private meal</i> </b>with a menu that I have designed just for them. <i>(If you are interested in getting onto the mailing list for Fond, simply send an email to FondLouisville at gmail dot com or comment on this campaign with your contact info.)</i>

<b>What does ""Fond"" mean? </b>Fond is a French word that means foundation or base. It is a term that is learned at the very beginning of culinary school to describe the yummy bits of food that stick to a pan and can be deglazed to add intense flavor when making things like sauces. It represents the roots of food and cooking. The basics. What truly matters when it comes to what we eat. It also means ""heart"" and ""soul"". It is a beautiful, meaningful word that is very important to me.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>My current business, No Place Like Home, will remain open so that customers both past and future can still have me prepare special meals in their homes. On those dates, no dinner will be served at Fond.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> <p>Lemme break it down:</p> <ul> <li>I need roughly $30,000 for my start up capital. Every cent of that has been planned out so that I can buy all the equipment I need (POS system, vacuum sealer, etc.), pay rent, make the space into a visually appealing store, and build a commercial kitchen. Not one penny will be used for anything other than what is absolutely necessary to start this business. </li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>The perks offered to you when you donate to this campaign are all designed so that you are both helping me bring my vision to life AND making your first purchase with Fond. You will essentially be buying products and paying for services when you give money to this campaign, and you can rest assured that you will be more than satisfied with your purchases!</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>If I don't reach my goal, that's ok! Should I have to, I can simply start Fond on a smaller scale than I have planned for, and I will build it up until I can make it fit the grand vision I've imagined. Every dollar will help bring my dream to life.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Why should you help? What difference will your contribution make?</p> <ul> <li>Louisville is a town full of insatiable foodies and folks who care about the origins of what they eat. Fond will be a small, quirky, local business with a heart that loves our city. It will improve Louisville's (and Kentucky's) economy by preparing and selling primarily local products, and it will keep Louisville weird! You'll also be helping to provide a venue for private, eclectic, delicious meals that can serve as celebrations for all sorts of special occasions. On a selfish note, you'll be contributing to me being able to successfully express myself on a creative level. If you love food and you love Louisville, you'll be helping yourself and your neighbors make our city a better place!</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>I have owned and operated a business for 5 years, and I will be bringing my large clientele with me. This will not be an effort without footing - I already have customers waiting to buy what I will prepare. You will not be gambling with your donation.</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>Throughout my life, it has been difficult for me to ask for help. I am asking for it now. I cannot do this without you. Please help me bring a cool, local business to my favorite city.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>First and foremost, dozens of future customers have demanded that Fond be located in the Highlands. Prime locations there are absurdly expensive, and they must be rented as soon as they are found. I am still seeking the building that will become Fond.</p>
<p>Secondly, Fond will live or die by social media. I will need every bit of help that I can get posting on every platform daily and getting everything shared so that I can keep the attention of my customers. That means that I will need each and every one of you to share menus, like pictures, and help get the word out so that I can make Fond a success!</p>
<p>Overall, there are relatively few risks other than the fact that it will be a food service establishment in a city where food businesses open and close every month. I have managed to be a success in the culinary industry for 5 years, and I am well-equipped to deal with the challenges, struggles, and annoying issues that I will face. I am no rookie. :)</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot donate any money, that's ok! I completely understand. But please spread the word and make some noise about my campaign. Tell anyone and everyone that I need their help! The more you share, the more people I can reach.</p>
<p>Please share this campaign on Facebook and Twitter. If you have a second, send a link to this page in an e-mail to your family members and friends. Let them know that they can help create something amazing in Louisville with just a few dollars that they'll never miss!</p>

My name is Madeleine Dee. I am a professional chef, writer, and part-time philanthropist. I like people, and people like me. I enjoy putting food in their faces and seeing them smile. For just shy of 5 years, I have owned and operated a highly successful personal chef business called No Place Like Home through which I have offered in-home dinners, party catering, cooking classes, & weekly meal preparation. I love my job, and my customers constantly say that they can tell. 
This campaign to raise money for my second business is about far more than myself - Fond, LLC. is about Louisville and the wonderful people who live here!

<br/><div>We; Aisling, Caoilian, Eszter, Irene, Leah &amp; Ruairi are delighted to be bringing you another Quarter Block Party for 2016. We’ve got a new plan, a new producer and a list of of fantastic ideas we want to bring to you.<div>

<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>We need €4,000 to contribute to the costs of putting on a festival. In return, we will offer you a number of money saving perks:</p>

</ul>
<p>We have a DELUXE and a BASIC budget for the festival, so the more money we raise the more DELUXE your experience will be. But whatever target we hit, we will create an incredible weekend of culture for Cork’s Historical spine. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The festival aims to celebrate North &amp; South Main street, Cork. It is the original and historical spine of the city. In supporting this festival, you are contributing to a cultural injection that is aimed directly at engaging with not only local artists, but also local traders and community groups.</p>
<p>Last year we created the festival from LOVE &amp; small funding!</p>
<p>Next year we want to build on that; to bring you a better &amp; bigger festival. Over 600 people attended last year!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our risks are engaging the local community in a way that is valuable to them - We’ve visited and spoken to every single business on the streets and we’re working with them to bring a well rounded event to the table.</p>
<p>We got your customer feedback about capacity &amp; ticket structures, we hear it and we’re working on something that addresses it for next year. Alongside that, we will also have a lot more free events, creating space for all! Even free events cost us to create, so any donation towards the festival benefits all the events. </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Are you flat broke or can’t afford to donate at this time? We hear that! But you can still:</p>

Imagine strengthening the community by providing safe, reliable transportation to help those in financial distress return to a strong function of society; keep their jobs; keep their kids in school; and overall improve their quality of life.  
Imagine helping us grow leadership and character through mentoring young adults by building trade and life skills through informal and free on-the-job-training.
Imagine helping us offer conversation and counseling to benefit the emotional and spiritual needs of our families while servicing their vehicles.
Please, help us move forward!
    Risks & Challenges
Without a trailer, we risk damage or loss to our hard earned equipment from theft or mother nature.  It's a constant challenge to be mobile without protection from the elements.  A trailer would eliminate that challenge in addition to providing protection from theft and improved inventory management.
    Other Ways You Can Help Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word or visit our website for more information at www.garagesofcare.org

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b><u>CAENDICA</u></b></h1>
<p>Caendica was created as a necessity to everyone who wants to
live a zero-carbs lifestyle, and every person who puts health as their
priority. Strolling through any Supermarket it becomes evident that there is an
attenuated lack of healthy, sugar-free, sugar-alcohol free, zero-gluten,
low-carbs and sugar-alcohol free foods; it’s impossible to just get in, buy a
healthy, tasty and affordable snack and then run out to continue their daily
rush. It is currently very difficult to give yourself an alternative to
confectionery foods that are loaded with sugars and carbohydrates; and dieting
has become synonymous with suffering, with plastic containers filled with
chicken breasts and broccoli and generally struggling for a nice piece of
chocolate, craving form some spread and needing some gummy goods while watching
your favorite show. All of this without compromising the diet, ketosis, or the
diabetic regimen. At any time someone can dip their spoon into the chocolate
spread knowing that their body lines won’t be affected.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Team</b></h2>
<p>We are a team of three people who come from business, economic,
gastronomy, biochemistry and product development backgrounds. </p>
<p><b>Marlind Maksuti</b>- the team leader, is currently double majoring
in Business and Economics in AUBG, specializes in biochemistry. Responsible for
the biochemical engineering side of the products and the logistics.  </p>
<p><b>Johan Baguca</b>- from The Hague University of Applied Science is

<h2><b>Products</b></h2>
<p>Caendica delivers products with low calorie content, nutritious
ingredients and most importantly nearly zero effective carbohydrates and sugar
(main culprits of diabetes, obesity and heart disease); without sacrificing
taste, texture or price. Starting with our four unique recipes for our products
we are able to bring a solution to the table by offering our target group a
healthy and convenient alternative to their problem. Our products are very
different from other confectionery products, although they might look the same
and taste just as sweet. Currently our repertoire includes:</p>

<p>Our products utilize healthy fats, protein, fibers, our special
blend of stevia and sweeteners and other healthy ingredients. There isn’t any
lactose or gluten in these products, while they contain a large amount of
naturally processed, high quality nuts.</p>
<p>We have created the products and perfected their makeup,
production process, and taste during a two year period. Our company has won
multiple prizes, as a recognition for our products and the development concept
we have. Caendica wants a future where WE will be able to choose the food based
on our nutritional preferences without sacrificing our gustatory likings. </p>
<p>We want to change an industry that forces people to either give
up on what they like, or indulge in horrible damaging food choices in the name
of price, taste and convenience.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Target Market</b></h2>
<p>Currently there is a lack of products that target people who
have diabetes or want to prevent it. It also leaves out the health conscious
population segment, who actively try to keep their bodies in shape. Evidently
our market size is considerable, taking into account that in New York i.e. 9.7%
suffer from diabetes, while 76% are health conscious, and 8.1% of the total
population actively cuts sugar from their diets; these percentages are reflected
in European cities too. In the Netherlands 4% of the population suffers from
diabetes, while up to 75% of the population actively ensures the consumption of
a healthy diet. At the same time students, sports enthusiasts and other health
concerned people are an important market section of our products, based on
their preferences, lifestyles and economic availability. We plan to optimize
production costs, so we can deliver a product that will be accessible in
supermarkets as a readily available alternative to the sugary filled
confectioneries. We plan to enter the market firstly through distribution to
gyms, and specialty stores interested in the products, then expand to have them
available in larger chain stores.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Campaign </b></h2>
<p>By contributing in Caendica you will jumpstart the fire of an
industry that is still in its infancy. We strive to change how food is
perceived and consumed, by enlarging our product selection as we grow to
encompass more and more everyday use products, make them very affordable thus
changing the paradigm that healthy food is expensive and making them
available everywhere; truly becoming an alternative to the sugary filled
confectioneries.</p>
<p>Our campaign strives to gather $75000 which will be used to buy
the equipment required to start a proper production plant, rent the facilities
within all international safety and hygiene standards to support production and
international distribution, finish up all the required documentation as well as
to buy the base materials in amounts that will allow low pricing and high
quality of the products.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Stages</b></h2>
<p>At this moment the biggest challenge is to build a fully
functional production facility and larger production so we can infiltrate the
market, via online sales, and most importantly by selling our products in
supermarket chains.</p>
<p>Our goal is to be the healthiest, but still keeping the great
taste, alternative to all the sugary filled products that are currently on the
market.</p>
<p>We want to organize an efficient distribution network and provide
our products to all the people that need to consume low carbs healthy diets.</p>
<p>We really want to help anyone who needs or wants to have a low
carbohydrate diet, who avoids sugar alcohol and who wants a gastronomically
rich life without sacrificing money or their health, so please Share our
campaign and tell everyone who might be interested in helping us grow, and
establish ourselves.</p>

We parted and I headed back home by a road I didn’t know very well and, as a result, didn’t notice a hole in the road and drove over it at a speed of about 70 km / h, flattening both of my wheels on the left side. (Note from the author: I drive a Mercedes E-class 2003 release, and as we all know there is only one spare wheel in the car). I switched on the emergency lights and changed one wheel. Then I had to decide what to do with the second wheel; it would be too far to drive to the nearest tire-change service, I was in the middle of a road connecting two villages, and it was late at night, so very few cars were passing by, if at all. All my attempts to contact any sort of car service were in vain, and I couldn’t explain to friends where I was geographically.

<p>I am a son of a Pastor
and 24 year U.S. Marine, growing up in this type of environment gave me a sense
of service to my community and to humanity. I also followed in my Fathers steps
and served 6 years in the U.S. Marines which opened my eyes to the world and lead me to enjoy traveling. I became aware of
the vastness of amazing products and incredible designers in Africa that were not
represented in the U.S. and the west. For the past 15 years I have been working
with different teams to streamline the process of showcasing top designers and
products from Africa at U.S. whole sale trade-shows. We now have a team of 120 people world wide,  a few military vets, business people, several people who have traveled through Africa, some educators, moms and dads etc. and all of us have joined
together to expand and improve the program. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are raising 200k to
instantly create jobs, ad the latest technology to implement our programs and to pay a modest salary to our existing volunteers in the U.S., Africa and around the world.  We will use 100k to pay our volunteer team so they can pick, ship and showcase the products at trade shows and on the
internet. We will use the remaining 100k for the infrastructure including buying products, opening small trade centers in Africa, setting up fulfillment centers in the U.S., hiring call
centers, updating our websites/e commerce,  marketing and management assistance. </p>
<p>When you support our
program you will instantly help communities around the world by creating jobs, promoting entrepreneurship, supporting artisans and since part of our profits for the past 15 years have
been used for Humanitarian efforts in the countries where we buy the products,
you will also be helping us to continue that mission. </p>
<p>Not only will you get
the satisfaction of assisting this amazing effort but with your donation you
will get one of our amazing products. You get to choose one of our high quality
unique products with your donation. Whether you choose an amazing home
furnishings product, a hand woven basket, quality leather product or beautiful jewelry
item you will be rewarded all the way around!!!!!</p>
<p>Even it we don’t reach
our entire goal which I am sure we will, whatever we raise will go towards the
project so no matter what you will have done your part to bring our beautiful
planet earth closer together. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our team are all
volunteers and have been working hard for free for the past year getting set
for the 2016 Holiday Season. The difference your contribution
will make is to create a sustainable business for 120 people. It will go a long way to assist the team members in Africa because this modest income will makes it easier for them to move around to villages and through the
cites to locate the most amazing products for you!!!! We will also be able to
bring our technology, CPA and legal assistance to a level so we can compete on
a global level. </p>
<p>Our program is
valuable to the world because it is a huge job creator and can do its part to
eradicate poverty through international trade. We have had many successes with the program over the years.  With little investment input into the program we where able to take it to a global level. We have built a
client base via U.S. trade shows of 600 stores that want to order our products, we have existing orders and we have assisted several primary schools, orphanages and villages in Africa and Asia and
trained over 100 us students in International Trade. </p>
<p>We have had our share of challenges and ups and downs, a few times with shipping, the weather and human errors but we have been working
hard meeting twice per weeks to alleviate as many of the risk as possible. We now
insure all of our shipments and work with UPS fulfillment center and Indiegogo
process to utilize risk minimization through out our systems.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you cannot
contribute monetarily, we still need your help getting the word out by posting our campaign to your
page and to group pages that you think may be interested. Its very easy
Indiegogo has share tools for several social media platforms so you don’t have
to work hard to help!!!!!</p><br/></div>","Our Story

The Impact
Our team are all
volunteers and have been working hard for free for the past year getting set
for the 2016 Holiday Season. The difference your contribution
will make is to create a sustainable business for 120 people. It will go a long way to assist the team members in Africa because this modest income will makes it easier for them to move around to villages and through the
cites to locate the most amazing products for you!!!! We will also be able to
bring our technology, CPA and legal assistance to a level so we can compete on
a global level. 
Our program is
valuable to the world because it is a huge job creator and can do its part to
eradicate poverty through international trade. We have had many successes with the program over the years.  With little investment input into the program we where able to take it to a global level. We have built a
client base via U.S. trade shows of 600 stores that want to order our products, we have existing orders and we have assisted several primary schools, orphanages and villages in Africa and Asia and
trained over 100 us students in International Trade. 
We have had our share of challenges and ups and downs, a few times with shipping, the weather and human errors but we have been working
hard meeting twice per weeks to alleviate as many of the risk as possible. We now
insure all of our shipments and work with UPS fulfillment center and Indiegogo
process to utilize risk minimization through out our systems.

</ul><p></p><h3>The Phononic HEX 1.0: A Refrigerator for Your CPU.</h3><p>Are you pushing your CPU to the limit? Do you know what it is like to smell smoke while trying to grab more GHz out of your processor? Have you ever tried to cram a water cooler radiator into your box only to discover you ran out of wire ties and the back cover won't fit? Judging from the gaming “rage quit” videos we’ve all seen on YouTube, you’re not alone. Finding a scalable way to cool your processor has been frustrating…until now. At Phononic, we don’t like mediocre or big clunky CPU coolers either. So we set out to fix it in a way nobody has done before. We turned to solid-state technology, the same approach that revolutionized microprocessors, solar, and LED lighting industries.</p><p>So what the heck does that mean? Simply put, we started over and leveraged Phononic’s SilverCore<sup>TM</sup> technology: high performance solid-state thermoelectric devices, heat sinks, and electronics. We didn’t stop there. </p><p>We wanted a smart cooling system that is electrically efficient and delivers performance only when needed. So we ran some numbers, created sophisticated models, ordered lunch, and challenged our engineers to solve the problem. The answer is Variable Assist Cooling (VAC); a mini control board that automatically responds to the thermal demands of your CPU, cooling the processor, and adjusting the fan based on your performance needs. Thermal muscle when you need it, quieter performance when you don't.</p><h3>How Does Variable Assist Cooling Work?</h3><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440265472/vxbfsvxtxwec1v1lylp0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><p>With Variable Assist Cooling (VAC), users can maximize thermal performance and minimize the power and noise associated with ever-changing CPU loads. The proprietary heat sink design moves heat through two dissipation paths – one is in direct contact with the CPU case and acts as a highly efficient fan heat sink and the second utilizes a Phononic SilverCore<sup>TM</sup> thermoelectric heat pump to cool the first “stage” and pull heat into the second heat exchanger.  The result of this system design is a cooler that greatly reduces CPU temperatures.  </p><p>As the processor load increases and the temperature starts to rise, the Phononic HEX 1.0 VAC control system activates the built-in cooling element to respond with a proportionate level of heat pumping, resulting in a lower CPU temperature. When the load on the CPU decreases, the heat pump will turn off and the CPU cooler will continue to perform as a high performance fan heat sink – drawing no power for the heat pump at all.</p><h3>How Big is Your Box?</h3><p>As microprocessors evolve, their feature sizes have shrunk allowing CPU manufacturers to pack more transistors into their devices which increases clock speeds and overall device performance (ever hear of Moore's Law?). More transistors and faster clock speeds also mean the processors runs hotter. </p><p>To remove heat from faster processors, manufacturers add larger heat sinks and high speed fans just to keep the CPUs from overheating resulting in larger computer cases. With larger cases, there was room for manufacturers to add more secondary fans to ensure that your CPU heatsink/fan combo was getting enough air to do its job.  </p><p>In today's sleek technology world, no one wants a big noisy box. So what is a user supposed to do to enjoy gaming in the living room or stream videos when the game is over? The answer is simple: The Phononic HEX 1.0 gives you the performance you need without the bulk of a much larger CPU cooler. That's right. Our CPU cooler will work in EATX towers and will also fit in Mini-ITX boxes as well.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440265514/t6cpoidkkylbujoxedpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Hydrate Yourself, Not Your Computer.</h3><p>Water and electricity should never mix. Period. Protect your equipment and yourself, and eliminate water from your investment. While you’re at it, remove the risk of you—or someone else—losing a finger by eliminating external facing fans. Our cooler chills using a Phononic solid-state thermoelectric heat pump (water-free) which comes with an integrated 80mm fan with fully enclosed blades. Safety first, right? Not to mention that ear plugs won’t be needed—this puppy is quiet. </p><h3>Become an early adopter!</h3><p>Get in on the latest cooling technology in high performance computing before it hits the retail market.

We turned to solid-state technology, the same approach that revolutionized microprocessors, solar, and LED lighting industries.So what the heck does that mean? Simply put, we started over and leveraged Phononic’s SilverCoreTM technology: high performance solid-state thermoelectric devices, heat sinks, and electronics. We didn’t stop there. We wanted a smart cooling system that is electrically efficient and delivers performance only when needed. So we ran some numbers, created sophisticated models, ordered lunch, and challenged our engineers to solve the problem. The answer is Variable Assist Cooling (VAC); a mini control board that automatically responds to the thermal demands of your CPU, cooling the processor, and adjusting the fan based on your performance needs. Thermal muscle when you need it, quieter performance when you don't.How Does Variable Assist Cooling Work?With Variable Assist Cooling (VAC), users can maximize thermal performance and minimize the power and noise associated with ever-changing CPU loads. The proprietary heat sink design moves heat through two dissipation paths – one is in direct contact with the CPU case and acts as a highly efficient fan heat sink and the second utilizes a Phononic SilverCoreTM thermoelectric heat pump to cool the first “stage” and pull heat into the second heat exchanger.  The result of this system design is a cooler that greatly reduces CPU temperatures.  As the processor load increases and the temperature starts to rise, the Phononic HEX 1.0 VAC control system activates the built-in cooling element to respond with a proportionate level of heat pumping, resulting in a lower CPU temperature. When the load on the CPU decreases, the heat pump will turn off and the CPU cooler will continue to perform as a high performance fan heat sink – drawing no power for the heat pump at all.How Big is Your Box?As microprocessors evolve, their feature sizes have shrunk allowing CPU manufacturers to pack more transistors into their devices which increases clock speeds and overall device performance (ever hear of Moore's Law?). More transistors and faster clock speeds also mean the processors runs hotter. To remove heat from faster processors, manufacturers add larger heat sinks and high speed fans just to keep the CPUs from overheating resulting in larger computer cases. With larger cases, there was room for manufacturers to add more secondary fans to ensure that your CPU heatsink/fan combo was getting enough air to do its job.  In today's sleek technology world, no one wants a big noisy box. So what is a user supposed to do to enjoy gaming in the living room or stream videos when the game is over? The answer is simple: The Phononic HEX 1.0 gives you the performance you need without the bulk of a much larger CPU cooler. That's right. Our CPU cooler will work in EATX towers and will also fit in Mini-ITX boxes as well.Hydrate Yourself, Not Your Computer.Water and electricity should never mix. Period. Protect your equipment and yourself, and eliminate water from your investment. While you’re at it, remove the risk of you—or someone else—losing a finger by eliminating external facing fans. Our cooler chills using a Phononic solid-state thermoelectric heat pump (water-free) which comes with an integrated 80mm fan with fully enclosed blades. Safety first, right? Not to mention that ear plugs won’t be needed—this puppy is quiet. Become an early adopter!Get in on the latest cooling technology in high performance computing before it hits the retail market. We’re offering early-adopter rates through our perks as well as a unique opportunity to join our development team as a beta tester. Beta testers will have access to a private forum where you can provide feedback and ""geek out"" with our team.

Cooling PerformanceThe measure of the effectiveness of a CPU cooler (or any heat exchanger in general) is the measure of its thermal resistance. This characteristic shows how much the temperature of the CPU will rise depending on the power being dissipated. The Phononic CPU cooler shows very low (<0.1 °C/W) thermal resistance with modest air flow (>15 CFM) which rivals or surpasses liquid coolers of similar size.  Overclocking ResultsTest Details:

Tested in OEM overclocked system @4.5 GHz


Mini-tower chassis


i7-4790 Intel processor – LGA1150 Socket


Running HyperPi floating point math application – 100% CPU power and speed


OEM system is 120mm fan remote radiator, closed loop liquid cooler


Phononic CPU cooler under maximum heat pumping mode for lowest temperature CPU

Test ResultsThe Phononic CPU cooler was able to deliver equal or lower CPU temperature as the OEM closed-loop liquid cooler. This was ~10 ℃ cooler than the measured CPU temperature of a conventional fan heat sink CPU cooler. Download our technical paper here for more information.Who is Phononic?Phononic is revolutionizing cooling and heating with solid state thermal management solutions.

I enjoy bodyart, taking pictures, architecture and trying new things. Once me and my friend didn't know how to congratulate our mutual friend. So we decided to draw a beautiful picture on our breasts with his name and age on it and sent it to him. During the process I realised that it could be cool to create a service that could help people to send funny messages to their friends. To realise this idea I rented a studio, took my friends and asked them to help me to create this video. And now you can see what we've done.</p>
<p>When you obtain any perk we will contact with you via e-mail  with the request to send the text, logo, picture or advertisement ,that you want to see depending on the type of your order. Executed order will be sent to your e-mail address.</p>
<b> </b><br/>How will my service look if I collect enough money?
<p>I will create  a website with the help of which any person will be able to order a photo or video-message with congratulation, advertisement, invitation or whatever which he can send to friend, relative, colleague, girlfriend, whoever.</p>
<p>The service could help you:<br/></p>
<p>To congratulate your friend on his birthday or invite him to spend evening together</p>
<p>to motivate your friend to work out in the gym</p>
<p>to congratulate your friend on marriage or talk him out of it</p>
<p>to inform your partners or colleagues about meeting postponement<br/></p>
<p>What invitation for fishing could be better than sexy girl with a fishing rod<br/></p>
<p>to congratulate your friend on his  achievements  in popular video-games</p>
<p>to boast to your friends about awesome vacation<br/></p>
<p>To break up with your girl....................................Easy! xD</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Wanna advertise your company logo, brand name, facebook group or  account, shop, your services ? What is the most rememberable advertisement for your potential customers? Of course the one on bodies of  our beautiful girls!</p>
<p>As you can see with the help of this service people will be able to say about serious things in an  easier and funnier way!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Partnership:</b><br/></p>
<p>I'd be glad if as many people as possible would know about my project. That's why I decided to present one photo to people who have more than 100 000 subscribers in social networks (instagram,facebook,youtube etc.) <br/></p>

</div></div>","Summary My name is Julia. I'm studying to be a photographer in Prague. I enjoy bodyart, taking pictures, architecture and trying new things. Once me and my friend didn't know how to congratulate our mutual friend. So we decided to draw a beautiful picture on our breasts with his name and age on it and sent it to him. During the process I realised that it could be cool to create a service that could help people to send funny messages to their friends. To realise this idea I rented a studio, took my friends and asked them to help me to create this video. And now you can see what we've done.
When you obtain any perk we will contact with you via e-mail  with the request to send the text, logo, picture or advertisement ,that you want to see depending on the type of your order. Executed order will be sent to your e-mail address.
 How will my service look if I collect enough money?
I will create  a website with the help of which any person will be able to order a photo or video-message with congratulation, advertisement, invitation or whatever which he can send to friend, relative, colleague, girlfriend, whoever.
The service could help you:
To congratulate your friend on his birthday or invite him to spend evening together
to motivate your friend to work out in the gym
to congratulate your friend on marriage or talk him out of it
to inform your partners or colleagues about meeting postponement
What invitation for fishing could be better than sexy girl with a fishing rod
to congratulate your friend on his  achievements  in popular video-games
to boast to your friends about awesome vacation
To break up with your girl....................................Easy! xD


Wanna advertise your company logo, brand name, facebook group or  account, shop, your services ? What is the most rememberable advertisement for your potential customers? Of course the one on bodies of  our beautiful girls!
As you can see with the help of this service people will be able to say about serious things in an  easier and funnier way!

Partnership:
I'd be glad if as many people as possible would know about my project. That's why I decided to present one photo to people who have more than 100 000 subscribers in social networks (instagram,facebook,youtube etc.)

<p>R-U-DRNK is a breathalyzer device that is placed on the power switch of the car whether it has a key switch or start button.</p>
<p>The device has a nozzle, to which the driver must blow, to record breath alcohol levels It sends this data via a Bluetooth connection to an application. If the device detects a low level of alcohol, it rotates and opens so you can insert the key or press the button to turn your car on, otherwise, if the alcohol levels are high, R-U-DRNK won't open.</p>
<p>The application sends an alert to a previously selected trusted person reporting that the driver is drunk and can not drive, generating a map with the location of the intoxicated person.</p>
<p>The device also allows both the drunk driver or the trusted person to request a taxi service to the location of the driver, so they can return home safely.</p>
<p>While the main purpose of the app is to request a taxi service and/or help from a trusted person when drunk, it also provides the hability to send an alert to the trusted person (or people) when the user is in need or danger. A taxi service can always be requested to the driver's location and the destination being a previously selected place (comonly the user's home). This feature is specially useful in flat-tire scenarios.</p>

<h4>Alcohol </h4>
</div><div>

</div></div>","R-U-DRNK is a breathalyzer device that is placed on the power switch of the car whether it has a key switch or start button.
The device has a nozzle, to which the driver must blow, to record breath alcohol levels It sends this data via a Bluetooth connection to an application. If the device detects a low level of alcohol, it rotates and opens so you can insert the key or press the button to turn your car on, otherwise, if the alcohol levels are high, R-U-DRNK won't open.
The application sends an alert to a previously selected trusted person reporting that the driver is drunk and can not drive, generating a map with the location of the intoxicated person.
The device also allows both the drunk driver or the trusted person to request a taxi service to the location of the driver, so they can return home safely.
While the main purpose of the app is to request a taxi service and/or help from a trusted person when drunk, it also provides the hability to send an alert to the trusted person (or people) when the user is in need or danger. A taxi service can always be requested to the driver's location and the destination being a previously selected place (comonly the user's home). This feature is specially useful in flat-tire scenarios.


10,076 people were killed in alcohol-impaired driving crashes in the US alone


Each year nearly 1.2 million people die and millions
more are injured or disabled as a result of road crashes





but with R-U-DRNK and your help we can reduce this figures significantly






When you are ok (read not drunk), the device rotates and opens.




Fully compatible with cars with key switches


And start buttons.



This is the device installed in your car, If you're okay to drive, the device is activated and rotates for you to insert the key and start your car.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you are drunk (even just a little, enough for your senses to be blured), the device is locked and won't allow you to start your car. The app informs the people you trust and sends them your current location.


It's closed, blocking the key swith so the car can't be started.


It is also compatible with start buttons.



If you are drunk, the device is locked and won't allow you to start the car. The app informs the people you trustand sends them your location


Alcohol 

Alcohol is absorbed into the body at a much faster rate than food. On an empty stomach, 20% alcohol is immediately absorbed into the bloodstream. The average person's body breaks down alcohol at rate of 20 to 30 mg/dL per hour and is metabolized by the body or excreted through the breath, sweat or urine.
The peak blood, and so we should no longer drive, is reached about when the said alcoholic beverage intake.




The application


If you are okay to drive the app will only display the percentage of alcohol in green with a ""you're okay to drive, care and respect traffic signals"" message.
You can always request help to your trusted people, or request a taxi service to your location, you know, in case of flat tire, sickness, car malfunction or a quick way to get a taxi home.
When you are drunk, the application will automatically alert the people you trust about your condition, so they can contact you or request a taxi service for you. You can always request that taxi service yourself.

When a taxi service is requested and accepted, information about your driver and ETA are displayed and sent to he people you trust, so they get important updates about how close you are from returning home safely.


Whether you are drunk or in need for help, your trusted people will receive alerts about your situation, your taxi driver and your ETA.

We cannot lie: Vermont is our favorite state. Here are some reasons: 
Vermont has made roadside advertising (billboards) illegal.
Burlington, its biggest city, runs on 100% wind, solar, and hydroelectric power.
Its fall foliage is the best in the country
Instead of letting ""Anywhere, USA"" architecture take over its towns, Vermont preserves its historic villages. Every town is a delight to the eyes.
It has some of the best skiing, snowboarding, XC skiing, snowshoeing, and mountain biking on the east coast.
It is a state that largely practices tolerance and acceptance
It borders a French-speaking province of Canada.   What You Get Here's what we're offering:  You can rent the house + the 3.5 acres it sits on for $50/night.

In using the word “community”, I mean building one that is thriving and inclusive. Being a part of somewhere where there is no “one” definition of community. </p><p>I want Arbor Hill to grow and be known as more than a geographic location. For this neighborhood to be known by the common interests and causes, recognized through a sense of identity and its shared emotional connections. Building upon shared values or norms, mutual influences and overall commitment to meeting the shared needs.</p><p>I was born and raised in Albany, New York after my family moved here from Shubuta, Mississippi &amp; Mobile, Alabama. My father has been active in Albany, having the most impact in Arbor Hill being that our family migrated to Dove Street &amp; Orange Street for affordable housing within the Capital Region. Watching him give back and serve his community instilled traits within me, that I would further develop, leading me to stay committed to the city I grew up in with my father and family.</p><p>I spent 3 years at Phillip Livingston Magnet Academy and saw the possibilities within Historic Arbor Hill as I grew up here, knowing at a young age I would give back to my community, through entrepreneurship and education in the community. </p><p>In partnership with Albany Housing Authority, I intend to bring the idea of shared workspace, called coworking to the Arbor Hill neighborhood, January 2016. This will be a mixed-use space promoting entrepreneurship within the community while educating current and aspiring business owners through seminars, special events, and mixers. I'm invested in Albany, New York and have committed to engaging the residents to help them start, run and grow small businesses. Whether they're just starting a business or working remotely for a company (while scaling their own product) I want to develop a space to work and a community full of like-minded (yet creative in their own way) individuals. Through this space, I aim to inspire collaboration, personal and professional development, mentorship, and empowerment here in the Capital Region. </p><p>The goal is to help people grow &amp; maintain a network to offer help, collaborate with, and support them through their professional journey. Members will have access to any monthly workshops we host and there will be free printing and scanning as well. The shared workspace will allow room for members to: teach a class of their own, bounce ideas during Friday brainstorms, make new friends at our monthly events and workshops, find help for every need with members from all industries and backgrounds. Here, they'll reach their full potential in a creative workspace, and join a supportive community full of fellow ambitious creators.</p><p>With that being said, I want to be a part of the change, moving forward, which is why I'm naming this business venture THRIVE because that is what I envision for the Arbor Hill neighborhood. For it to become &amp; maintain being a neighborhood AND community that flourishes for residents, workers, and entrepreneurs. October 2014, American Planning Association named Arbor Hill as one of America's 10 great neighborhoods. I aspire to maintain it's eminence.</p><b>About Me</b><div>My name is Kaciem Swain. I'm the Creative Director for Idea Engineering at FlagshipUltra - a creative think-tank agency and idea lab producing brands, events, products in Albany, New York. I'm also a freelance business coach at Train With Swain. I help brands, creatives, startups, and small business owners start, run and grow. This campaign is important to me because I was born in raised in the community that I'm looking to bring a coworking space to. I've been an entrepreneur for 11 years, starting with a nightlife promotions company which eventually pivoted to become a special events company. Arbor Hill is currently going through a new growth phase. The city has built housing, a live/work space for artists, an art gallery and a new park in the neighborhood and I want entrepreneurs to join me in this community. You will join me in promoting the message of entrepreneurship and job creation through bringing startups and small businesses to the capital region while growing the ones we currently have here!<p></p>

<p>Coworking supports small businesses! and small businesses are key for a healthy economy! Entrepreneurship is encouraged through the creation of the right working environment. Talent stays in town, creating an environment for innovation and entrepreneurship helps talent feel good and supported when taking the initiative to start their own business. New networks of collaborations emerge - both physical and through online platforms! Projects are locally grown and with potential global impact!</p>
<p><b>Growth</b> - While THRIVE grows, so will our ability to provide convenient and affordable space and opportunities will grow too - meaning we can do more, better and faster while making a larger impact within our community.</p>
<p><span><b>Education</b> - By hosting classes and workshops at affordable prices we can make learning affordable for the members and neighborhood residents.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>While we will use funds raised from this campaign only for capital and build-out expenses, our coworking space is dependent on revenue from members, visitors, and programming or rentals. Like any business, we could see a drop-off in subscriptions and purchases that could endanger our long-term plans for the space.</p>
<p>Our estimates on the cost of capital purchases could be off, and unexpected or emergency costs could supplant the items listed above. But we will endeavor to stick to the original spirit and intent of this campaign in using any funds acquired.</p>
<p>We believe we are qualified to overcome any miscalculations or overages because we have been addressing those kinds of problems for nearly 2 years. We believe in our community space, and we want to make it as presentable as possible to our own city and its visitors.</p>
<p>What we are trying to do with this campaign is to use Indiegogo in the most faithful way possible: to rev up a unique project in Arbor Hill, build some excitement around it, make it beneficial to the people who live here, and move a bit faster than we might if we continued on from our own spare cash.</p>
<p>THRIVE is not a non-profit, but it is, informally, not a business any of the founders expect to feed their retirement funds. It's a labor of love. When we see people helping with each others' projects and chatting over coffee, groups planning events after-hours, and lots of newcomers enjoying a feeling of ""heading to work,"" we feel good about our investment. We think you might feel good about investing in this, too.</p>

Thank You.</div></div>","WHAT IS COWORKING?Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people, who are still working independently, but who share values, and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with talented people in the same space.The Community Impact StatementArbor Hill is a neighborhood AND community that is deserving of new opportunities, partnership development, and continued growth. In using the word “community”, I mean building one that is thriving and inclusive. Being a part of somewhere where there is no “one” definition of community. I want Arbor Hill to grow and be known as more than a geographic location. For this neighborhood to be known by the common interests and causes, recognized through a sense of identity and its shared emotional connections. Building upon shared values or norms, mutual influences and overall commitment to meeting the shared needs.I was born and raised in Albany, New York after my family moved here from Shubuta, Mississippi & Mobile, Alabama. My father has been active in Albany, having the most impact in Arbor Hill being that our family migrated to Dove Street & Orange Street for affordable housing within the Capital Region. Watching him give back and serve his community instilled traits within me, that I would further develop, leading me to stay committed to the city I grew up in with my father and family.I spent 3 years at Phillip Livingston Magnet Academy and saw the possibilities within Historic Arbor Hill as I grew up here, knowing at a young age I would give back to my community, through entrepreneurship and education in the community. In partnership with Albany Housing Authority, I intend to bring the idea of shared workspace, called coworking to the Arbor Hill neighborhood, January 2016. This will be a mixed-use space promoting entrepreneurship within the community while educating current and aspiring business owners through seminars, special events, and mixers. I'm invested in Albany, New York and have committed to engaging the residents to help them start, run and grow small businesses. Whether they're just starting a business or working remotely for a company (while scaling their own product) I want to develop a space to work and a community full of like-minded (yet creative in their own way) individuals. Through this space, I aim to inspire collaboration, personal and professional development, mentorship, and empowerment here in the Capital Region. The goal is to help people grow & maintain a network to offer help, collaborate with, and support them through their professional journey. Members will have access to any monthly workshops we host and there will be free printing and scanning as well. The shared workspace will allow room for members to: teach a class of their own, bounce ideas during Friday brainstorms, make new friends at our monthly events and workshops, find help for every need with members from all industries and backgrounds. Here, they'll reach their full potential in a creative workspace, and join a supportive community full of fellow ambitious creators.With that being said, I want to be a part of the change, moving forward, which is why I'm naming this business venture THRIVE because that is what I envision for the Arbor Hill neighborhood. For it to become & maintain being a neighborhood AND community that flourishes for residents, workers, and entrepreneurs. October 2014, American Planning Association named Arbor Hill as one of America's 10 great neighborhoods. I aspire to maintain it's eminence.About MeMy name is Kaciem Swain.

<b><h3>What Is It's Borrowed?<br/>
</h3></b>Need something for one day or a week.? Find it on It's Borrowed. It's Borrowed is a mobile App allowing you to “borrow"" everyday items like camping items, tools, sports gear, etc. from people just like yourself that have these items just sitting unused in their garage or closets. No need to buy items that you’ll use one time then toss in the corner to gather dust. <br/><br/>Already got stuff gathering dust not making you money? Create an It's Borrowed rental store page and you can easily generate money from items sitting around your house.

<h2>Ignite Your Creativity with Spark Spaces Coworking !</h2>
<div> </div>
<p>Spark Spaces Coworking is finishing the build out of our space in Prince George’s County so we can welcome our first members this Fall. Spark Spaces Coworking will then become home to creative entrepreneurs, developers, consultants, innovators, makers, work-from-homers and startups. Pretty much any one who is looking for a collaborative community work environment is welcome. The resulting community will help each member, thrive and inspire each other.</p>
<p>We want Spark Spaces Coworking to be more than just desks, chairs, free wifi, coffee and organics snacks. Anyone can sublease an office, snag a seat at the local coffeehouse or library we wanted a coworking space that actually reflects the community it serves and the result is SparkSpaces.co. which is being built specifically to promote small business development, networking, collaboration, and  energy of the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Are We Raising Funds on IndieGoGo?</h3>
<p>Why not? We really love the IndieGoGo community! Where else can you find so many awesome people willing to pitch in a couple of dollars (or more, hopefully more :-D) to help dreams come to fruition? We've supported other fundraisers here and knew it would be the perfect place to promote Spark Spaces Coworking and present our rewards for your contribution to the campaign. Plus, the more people who give, the more people we're accountable to and we are cool with that.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So, What's Next?</h3>
<p>We'll be opening soon, like really soon (October 2, 2016) and the funds raised on IndieGoGo will be used to paint, and furnish our space. This is where your contribution comes in—we need to raise some money to furnish our space so our members and guests can enjoy a great work environment.Your donation will <i>not </i>be used to fund our operations. As we are bootstrapping the crap out of this with our own funds, too. We're also working with local vendors (awesome thrift shops, antique shops, carpenter and dope ass artist) in the community and carefully selecting our purchases so we can make sure that every single dime from our IndieGoGo fundraiser is used to make a kick-ass coworking space that you will be proud of. This is your money, coins, dinero, checks and we plan to spend it wisely.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472317405/cclfgsc2pj8vjp9brvgr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With your support, we'll be able to transform  our space with furniture, paint, flooring, light fixtures and more to make it an awesome place to work. Our little List includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paint</li>
<li>A couple of couches</li>
<li>Desks</li>
<li>Chairs</li>
<li>Conference Table</li>
<li>A few lockers</li>
<li>Shelfs</li>
<li>Bookcase</li>
<li>Mini-fridge to keep drinks cold</li>
<li>Mail slots to accept packages</li>
<li>Signage; so we can let everyone know where we are.</li>
<li>Light fixtures</li>
<li>Electrical Updates (comes with the territory with a building over 100 years old)</li>
<li>Conference Room Clean Up and Redesign (There is literally a tree growing through the window) </li>
<li>Bathroom Update and Repairs. </li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>If you donate, be sure to sign up for our e-newsletter on our site <a href=""http://www.sparkspaces.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sparkspaces.co</a>. Also, be sure to follow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for updates and behind-the-scenes deets of our daily shenanigans. We want you to be part of the fun and hopefully stop by and check us out.</p>
<h3>So How Does the Space Look Now?</h3>
<p>Well, not much. But, we can see the beauty of a transformed space and the community rocks!!!</p>
<p>Here is a pic of our historic building (seriously this building is over 100 years old, it’s so cool). Don't judge. It just needs a big hug a lot of love, some fresh paint and new signage. In other words it is going to take some work, and tons of elbow grease.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471198900/ehgrufw60jwihgj5nzei.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>Some interior shots :-D.

<p>So paint and carpet removal. We are hoping the hardwood underneath just needs some buffing and shine to restore its natural beauty. </p>

<p>Another vintage water cooler :-D. More paint, carpet removal, hardwood buff and light fixtures and furniture. </p>

<br/><br/>   
<p>We will be located in the heart of the Historic Mount Rainier Community off of Rhode Island Avenue. Literally in the center of Mt. Rainer, where a 5 minute can put you in either be in D.C. or Hyattsville, MD.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472317268/byeacbzstlfmogxfv5j6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We love this community and how they support entrepreneurs and artist; and we love the growth that the county has planned for the area. I mean they even have their own community currency here so you can trade goods and services; how cool is that. Amazing organic eateries, organic co-op grocery, bike co-ops, super cute library and artist studios galore. <h3>A Little About Us.</h3>
<p>Spark Spaces Coworking Community was founded to harness the entrepreneurial energy of Prince George’s County . There are many exciting things happening in the heart of the Prince George’s Gateway Arts District and a quick 5 minute walk to DC, including incredible web &amp; app development, artist and entrepreneurial communities.</p>
<h3>So, Who is Behind Spark Spaces?</h3>

</div>","Ignite Your Creativity with Spark Spaces Coworking !
 
Spark Spaces Coworking is finishing the build out of our space in Prince George’s County so we can welcome our first members this Fall. Spark Spaces Coworking will then become home to creative entrepreneurs, developers, consultants, innovators, makers, work-from-homers and startups. Pretty much any one who is looking for a collaborative community work environment is welcome. The resulting community will help each member, thrive and inspire each other.
We want Spark Spaces Coworking to be more than just desks, chairs, free wifi, coffee and organics snacks. Anyone can sublease an office, snag a seat at the local coffeehouse or library we wanted a coworking space that actually reflects the community it serves and the result is SparkSpaces.co. which is being built specifically to promote small business development, networking, collaboration, and  energy of the community.
 
Why Are We Raising Funds on IndieGoGo?
Why not? We really love the IndieGoGo community! Where else can you find so many awesome people willing to pitch in a couple of dollars (or more, hopefully more :-D) to help dreams come to fruition? We've supported other fundraisers here and knew it would be the perfect place to promote Spark Spaces Coworking and present our rewards for your contribution to the campaign. Plus, the more people who give, the more people we're accountable to and we are cool with that.
 
So, What's Next?
We'll be opening soon, like really soon (October 2, 2016) and the funds raised on IndieGoGo will be used to paint, and furnish our space. This is where your contribution comes in—we need to raise some money to furnish our space so our members and guests can enjoy a great work environment.Your donation will not be used to fund our operations. As we are bootstrapping the crap out of this with our own funds, too. We're also working with local vendors (awesome thrift shops, antique shops, carpenter and dope ass artist) in the community and carefully selecting our purchases so we can make sure that every single dime from our IndieGoGo fundraiser is used to make a kick-ass coworking space that you will be proud of. This is your money, coins, dinero, checks and we plan to spend it wisely.

With your support, we'll be able to transform  our space with furniture, paint, flooring, light fixtures and more to make it an awesome place to work. Our little List includes:

Paint
A couple of couches
Desks
Chairs
Conference Table
A few lockers
Shelfs
Bookcase
Mini-fridge to keep drinks cold
Mail slots to accept packages
Signage; so we can let everyone know where we are.
Light fixtures
Electrical Updates (comes with the territory with a building over 100 years old)
Conference Room Clean Up and Redesign (There is literally a tree growing through the window) 
Bathroom Update and Repairs. 
and more

If you donate, be sure to sign up for our e-newsletter on our site www.sparkspaces.co. Also, be sure to follow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for updates and behind-the-scenes deets of our daily shenanigans. We want you to be part of the fun and hopefully stop by and check us out.
So How Does the Space Look Now?
Well, not much. But, we can see the beauty of a transformed space and the community rocks!!!
Here is a pic of our historic building (seriously this building is over 100 years old, it’s so cool). Don't judge. It just needs a big hug a lot of love, some fresh paint and new signage. In other words it is going to take some work, and tons of elbow grease.
 Some interior shots :-D. Well hello Beth and vintage water cooler.
So paint and carpet removal. We are hoping the hardwood underneath just needs some buffing and shine to restore its natural beauty. 

Another vintage water cooler :-D. More paint, carpet removal, hardwood buff and light fixtures and furniture. 
And here is our view from the top. Hello neighbors!!!
   
We will be located in the heart of the Historic Mount Rainier Community off of Rhode Island Avenue. Literally in the center of Mt. Rainer, where a 5 minute can put you in either be in D.C. or Hyattsville, MD.
We love this community and how they support entrepreneurs and artist; and we love the growth that the county has planned for the area. I mean they even have their own community currency here so you can trade goods and services; how cool is that. Amazing organic eateries, organic co-op grocery, bike co-ops, super cute library and artist studios galore. A Little About Us.
Spark Spaces Coworking Community was founded to harness the entrepreneurial energy of Prince George’s County . There are many exciting things happening in the heart of the Prince George’s Gateway Arts District and a quick 5 minute walk to DC, including incredible web & app development, artist and entrepreneurial communities.

Through social media, in 6 months, we were able to extend our reach to 12 million people worldwide, of which you are a part. <br/><br/>We are committed to keeping our communities on their homelands and we have been consulting among our own people to develop sustainable and viable models for communities, outstations and seasonal campsites. <br/><br/>We are now in a position to move forward in our humanitarian effort as we begin the steps toward sustainability. By donating now, you will be making a contribution to enable Aboriginal Communities to access green energy, which is a critical step forward in viability and one we will be able to leverage on for further support.  <br/><br/>Through a combined effort, what we will achieve is for communities to be able to harness the alternative power sources needed in order to run water-pumping stations, medical facilities, schools and other municipal services effectively.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The current situation</h3>
</div><div> <p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Remote Aboriginal communities need our help. After ongoing neglect from successive
governments, the infrastructure is largely substandard and more akin to third world
conditions than that of a first world country. <br/><br/>Of the 1139 Aboriginal communities
nationwide, there are 274 remote Aboriginal Communities in Western Australia (WA)
who remain at the epicentre of the threat of closure. Recently it was reported that eighty
per cent of remote Aboriginal communities in WA whose essential services are delivered
under a state-run program failed water safety tests by testing positive for E coli or
Naegleria. In addition to those breaches, the water supplies of one in five communities in
the program showed unsafe levels of nitrates or uranium contamination.
</p>
<p>Of the 3,040 dwellings across these communities in WA, most need major repairs or
replacement. Overcrowded conditions can put stress on household amenities
such as cooking equipment and sewerage systems, potentially affecting safety,
and may also contribute to higher transmission rates of infectious diseases.
Many houses need one or more extra bedrooms to adequately accommodate <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">all residents and others require demolition to alleviate issues with asbestos and
substandard building. Not all people in remote Indigenous communities have a
permanent dwelling as a home - over 1,500 people are still living in temporary
dwellings such as sheds or humpies.<br/><br/>We know that the impact of the threat of forced closure has had a significant negative impact on well-being, particularly on Elders, some of which have explicitly stated they will die before they would be forced to leave. We know that of the communities who have already been closed, that the direct result has been over-crowding and homelessness. Should the State and Federal Governments continue as they are, they will force over 20,000 Aboriginal people into homelessness. This is heartbreaking.</span></p>
<p>In lifting the threat of forced closure from remote Aboriginal Communities we aim to make
every Aboriginal community sustainable.  We will do this as our cultural continuum is vital to the core of humanity and it is the right thing to do.</p>

Through social media, in 6 months, we were able to extend our reach to 12 million people worldwide, of which you are a part. We are committed to keeping our communities on their homelands and we have been consulting among our own people to develop sustainable and viable models for communities, outstations and seasonal campsites. We are now in a position to move forward in our humanitarian effort as we begin the steps toward sustainability. By donating now, you will be making a contribution to enable Aboriginal Communities to access green energy, which is a critical step forward in viability and one we will be able to leverage on for further support.  Through a combined effort, what we will achieve is for communities to be able to harness the alternative power sources needed in order to run water-pumping stations, medical facilities, schools and other municipal services effectively.

    The current situation
 



Remote Aboriginal communities need our help. After ongoing neglect from successive
governments, the infrastructure is largely substandard and more akin to third world
conditions than that of a first world country. Of the 1139 Aboriginal communities
nationwide, there are 274 remote Aboriginal Communities in Western Australia (WA)
who remain at the epicentre of the threat of closure. Recently it was reported that eighty
per cent of remote Aboriginal communities in WA whose essential services are delivered
under a state-run program failed water safety tests by testing positive for E coli or
Naegleria. In addition to those breaches, the water supplies of one in five communities in
the program showed unsafe levels of nitrates or uranium contamination.

Of the 3,040 dwellings across these communities in WA, most need major repairs or
replacement. Overcrowded conditions can put stress on household amenities
such as cooking equipment and sewerage systems, potentially affecting safety,
and may also contribute to higher transmission rates of infectious diseases.
Many houses need one or more extra bedrooms to adequately accommodate all residents and others require demolition to alleviate issues with asbestos and
substandard building. Not all people in remote Indigenous communities have a
permanent dwelling as a home - over 1,500 people are still living in temporary
dwellings such as sheds or humpies.We know that the impact of the threat of forced closure has had a significant negative impact on well-being, particularly on Elders, some of which have explicitly stated they will die before they would be forced to leave. We know that of the communities who have already been closed, that the direct result has been over-crowding and homelessness. Should the State and Federal Governments continue as they are, they will force over 20,000 Aboriginal people into homelessness. This is heartbreaking.
In lifting the threat of forced closure from remote Aboriginal Communities we aim to make
every Aboriginal community sustainable.  We will do this as our cultural continuum is vital to the core of humanity and it is the right thing to do.

    Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone will be in a position financially to support this campaign, so we ask that you consider the other ways you can assist:  As an individual, have the quality conversations within your circle of family and friends and let them know about this campaign.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Inthebitcoin.com is a website with a single goal - promote the use of bitcoin currency. Users can save short messages inside bitcoin's blockchain. Every stored message once stored can not be deleted or changed and will stay inside the blockchain forever.  For every message we generate a special video which the user can share online.

What We Need


1. Improve videos

We need funds to improve our videos. See our first one below. Yeah not very pretty. We would like to make more of them and of better quality  so users will be able to pick and choose.

2. Create tutorials 
We would like to create tutorials and animations how to use bitcoins for various purposes. See our first one published on medium.com. We would like to create more of them so users can read and get more familiar with bitcoins. Our goal is to make more of them on different topics related to bitcoins. This animation we created to visualise live bitcoin transactions. Be careful it is quite hypnotising. 
What You Get


You as a contributor you will help to improve the project and at the same time learn how to use bitcoins and have fun sending and sharing video messages with your friends.

Each contributor will get a number of coupons (see our perks on the right) to store your personal messages free of charge (without the need to even own the bitcoins). You might even propose the next video theme or tutorial topic.
The Impact
 More people will get familiar with bitcoins. By using videos, animations and social media we are trying to reach to people not familiar with bitcoins. By running this campaign we offer a possibility to try bitcoins and learn something about them without the need to actually own any bitcoin at all.We believe that bitcoins will bring very positive change to the whole world, but to make it happen we need to reach a critical adoption mass. 
Risks & Challenges
 There aren't many risks, all the money from this campaign will go directly to support the development of inthebitcoin.com, fix bugs, create new animations and tutorials.
Each new added feature or improvements will be described in the changelog published on github. As a contributor you will receive weekly notification about our progress.
We are very dedicated to improve inthebitcoin.com and to spread the information about it. With your support will be able proceed faster and reach many more current and future bitcoin users.

<div> I am fed up of being alienated and made to feel bad because I have a medical condition that means I can not eat something (that is a staple food to most and hides and sneaks its way into many foods totally unnecessarily), IT'S NOT MY FAULT AND NOT MY CHOICE, its just the way it has to be if we want to stay well and healthy, so we have to make peace with it, I wish they would too.</div>

<b>A bit about me.</b><br/>
</div>
<div>My name is Chantal, I am a chef and mummy of two. Myself, my kids and a few other members of my family are gluten free. I have been gluten free for over 20 years, back then us gluten free folk were lucky to find a loaf of ""bread"" that literally tasted of rancid cardboard and disintegrated into a pile of crumbs at the slightest touch! I <span>have witnessed first hand the transformation of the gluten free world we live in, it has got 1000% better than it was 20 years ago, but I believe there is still a huge way to go. </span><span>So I had to learn how to cook, and sharpish. I believe my passion for food and cooking came from this, having to cook everything from scratch, so I went to college to learn to become a proper chef.</span>
</div>
<div>
<span>My journey as a chef has been a pretty amazing one, </span><span>I have been catering, doing product development for restaurants and been a private chef </span><span>working in the beautiful Hannover terrace in Regent's Park, cooked for some lovely families, </span><span>(I even cooked for a few famous people Including the infamous Madonna)  and then in 2012 alongside my adorable Dad, I opened a small Tapas restaurant, </span><span>in the leafy suburbs of North London, unfortunately we had to close it after just under a year of trading due to licensing problems that could not be rectified. We lost a lot of money and it was a very difficult time emotionally as well as financially. </span>
</div>
<div>
<span>The restaurant wasn't fully gluten free, however for every item on the menu there was a gluten free alternative available. We got amazing reviews from customers and local papers.</span><br/>

Her Patatas Bravas are punchy and her Alioli dip which can be served alongside potatoes, calamari or whitebait is gutsy with garlic. For starters, the Montaditos de Jamon was utterly faultless, much like bruschetta, these artisan bread toasts were topped with a generous helping of superior Serrano ham and garnished with coriander, tomatoes and olive oil. We also sampled velvety pork ribs glazed with warming orange, thyme and paprika and a divine saffron scented chickpea stew.<br/>My husband also enjoyed the slow roasted chicken with garlic and lemon and some succulent and especially tender marinated chicken skewers.<br/>Chantal is not afraid to be bold and passionate with your palate and her expertise in matching the flavours of herbs and spices expertly with meat and vegetables is first-class.

My cooking classes will be hands on small  classes, from complete beginner courses to more advanced stuff, and takeaway favourites.

How about gluten free speed dating? 
 I also want to Educate other restaurants on gluten free food, on cross contamination, show them how they can quite simply and easily change their menus to become more gluten free friendly and allergen aware.


The final part of my plan is to pop up a gluten free restaurant every so often to spread the gluten free love around the UK in due course, at festivals , etc.

processors (Like Arduino or ESP8266), this kit shows you how and why 
you'd want to host a webserver on portable device. We've been working on
 this for over a year and a half, it's been very challenging bringing 
this product to market, now we need you to help us get the cost down. In
 return, we'll ship your kit out by December 15th using Priority Mail 
2-Day™ from the US Postal Service (Sorry no international shipping). 
We'll do everything possible to make sure your kit is delivered before 
Christmas. We want you to enjoy building together during the holiday 
break.</p>
<p>We are available via Skype to help out if you get stuck our SkypeID 
is CreateSTEAM.com. We'll also have a forum where you can share and get 
tips on different projects. We share our work, to help everyone, you can
 see the apps and the firmware for the ESP8266 micro controller at 
CreateSTEAM.com .</p>
<h3>Why we need your help and what you'll get for it... 
</h3><p>We need to be able to order parts for 100 kits to get a discount rate from our supplier. </p><br/><ul>
<li>Each
 kit includes (1) ESP826-12E (1) H-bridge motor driver (2) motors and 
wheels (1) 4X AA Battery pack. Also wires and screws to complete the 
kit.</li>
<li>Each kit is complete and pretested</li>
<li>This is the only pre-programmed pre-wired kit we've ever seen.</li>
<li>This is the lowest priced programmable robotic kit on the market.</li>
<li>We'll ship any amount of kits ordered, we hate to disappointing people!</li>
</ul> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This
 is a labor of love, for me to have shown my children how and ""what it 
takes"" to bring this product to market, along with their insistence on 
moving the project forward (Driving 6.5 hours each way from NJ to 
Ottawa, Ca to test market the first set of kits, mom joined us for 
tactical support), we all hope to share  :</p> <ul>
<li>Learning about technology as a ""shared experience"", is wonderful</li>
<li>Showing your kids how you learn and your kids will in turn showing you, is an iterative process that we've enjoyed for years.</li>
<li>Your success is our goal.</li>
</ul> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>To keep the 
costs down we are 3D printing the wheels, since we have one 3D printer 
keeping that running to print out 500 wheels is hard work, at this time 
we printed over 300 wheels as a head start and reduce the risk. 
Programming and building the kits takes time. </p><ul>
<li>We've programmed, built and sold over 30 kits as a test (@Maker Faire Ottawa &amp; Poughkeepsie, NY. Shout out and Thanks!)  </li>
<li>We'll hire a programmer to make the second stretch goal of a game app for the car. </li>

 see the apps and the firmware for the ESP8266 micro controller at 
CreateSTEAM.com .
Why we need your help and what you'll get for it... 
We need to be able to order parts for 100 kits to get a discount rate from our supplier. 
Each
 kit includes (1) ESP826-12E (1) H-bridge motor driver (2) motors and 
wheels (1) 4X AA Battery pack. Also wires and screws to complete the 
kit.
Each kit is complete and pretested
This is the only pre-programmed pre-wired kit we've ever seen.
This is the lowest priced programmable robotic kit on the market.
We'll ship any amount of kits ordered, we hate to disappointing people!
 The Impact This
 is a labor of love, for me to have shown my children how and ""what it 
takes"" to bring this product to market, along with their insistence on 
moving the project forward (Driving 6.5 hours each way from NJ to 
Ottawa, Ca to test market the first set of kits, mom joined us for 
tactical support), we all hope to share  : 
Learning about technology as a ""shared experience"", is wonderful
Showing your kids how you learn and your kids will in turn showing you, is an iterative process that we've enjoyed for years.
Your success is our goal.
 Risks & Challenges To keep the 
costs down we are 3D printing the wheels, since we have one 3D printer 
keeping that running to print out 500 wheels is hard work, at this time 
we printed over 300 wheels as a head start and reduce the risk. 
Programming and building the kits takes time. 
We've programmed, built and sold over 30 kits as a test (@Maker Faire Ottawa & Poughkeepsie, NY. Shout out and Thanks!)  
We'll hire a programmer to make the second stretch goal of a game app for the car.

<p>I met Zayzay Kpadeh 14 years ago when he made his way from
Liberia to Upper Darby, PA.  His life was
threatened during the brutal and devastating 13-year civil war in Liberia and
he made the decision to seek refugee status in the U.S.  He lost family and friends in this cruel war
that took the lives of over 300,000 innocent men, women and children.  He was targeted for death and witnessed first
hand many horrible killings.  He arrived
in the U.S. with nothing and was given a job at Christ Lutheran Church where we
got to know one another. </p>
<p>In the 14 years I have known Zayzay, he has not ceased being
concerned about his family, friends and street children in Liberia as well as
concern for the Liberian community in the U.S. 
He has coordinated many drives to collect clothes, books, toys,
computers, and other things that were shipped to Liberia.  At the same time he developed and executed a
workshop for Liberians in Upper Darby/Lansdowne on understanding Biblical
stories about the many peoples who left their own countries and found comfort
and faith in their God.  Zayzay also
has a radio talk show for Liberians, which you can hear on <a href=""http://www.christianvisionbroadcastingnetworkcvbn.biz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.christianvisionbroadcastingnetworkcvbn.biz/</a></p>
<p>Zayzay just completed his Doctorate from Drew University,
and he is now the Reverend Dr. Zayzay Kpadeh. 
I am so proud of him and consider him a close friend.  I want to help him raise funds to return to
Liberia and make an on-the-ground assessment of the social service and
educational needs of Liberians outside Monrovia.  He will also touch base with the Rotary Club
of Monrovia to identify synergies for Liberian projects. Zayzay needs $3,000
more to make the trip home and conduct the needs assessment in person.  His target timeframe for the trip is
October.  Helping others has been his
life’s mission.  Please help Zayzay to
continue helping others by making a donation to this humble campaign for a  social justice ministry project to Liberia. </p>

</p><p>Hi, thanks for dropping by our page.</p>
<p>We are Paul and Teresa of Wild Dharma.</p>
<p>Wild Dharma is an eco resort, nature
sanctuary and yoga and meditation retreat centre situated on the wild and
beautiful west coast of Palawan in the Philippines.</p>
<p>We are committed to development that integrates
and includes the personal, social and environmental needs of everyone
involved, from our guests to our staff and, in particular, the local communities
in the area.</p>
<p>The local people live in extreme
poverty which makes day to day life very difficult for them. This is especially
evident in the health situation. They have very limited access to
healthcare and education. <br/>
For this reason, one of the first things we will be doing here is building a
health clinic for them. </p>
<p> Wild Dharma will rise in
stages and while we work towards being able to achieve our longer term goals, including more integral social health solutions in the area, we feel we cannot put off the
immediate needs for healthcare.  </p>
<p>So we are seeking your help to raise funds for the health
clinic.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">JOIN US IN CREATING A HEALTHIER FUTURE FOR THE PEOPLE OF PALAWAN</span></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443936920/mp8efkvfi5lh7d9fkpi3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>   </p><p>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444793203/o7vqpdyym6vecvptewyc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 275.356px; height: 335px;""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">      </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444793391/ijqiea82xi3idtmsckbv.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 277px; height: 333px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Paul Wooden and Teresa Tirol are creating Wild Dharma because w</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">e are both passionate about participating in life in a way that

</div></div>","Hi, thanks for dropping by our page.
We are Paul and Teresa of Wild Dharma.
Wild Dharma is an eco resort, nature
sanctuary and yoga and meditation retreat centre situated on the wild and
beautiful west coast of Palawan in the Philippines.
We are committed to development that integrates
and includes the personal, social and environmental needs of everyone
involved, from our guests to our staff and, in particular, the local communities
in the area.
The local people live in extreme
poverty which makes day to day life very difficult for them. This is especially
evident in the health situation. They have very limited access to
healthcare and education. 
For this reason, one of the first things we will be doing here is building a
health clinic for them. 
 Wild Dharma will rise in
stages and while we work towards being able to achieve our longer term goals, including more integral social health solutions in the area, we feel we cannot put off the
immediate needs for healthcare.  
So we are seeking your help to raise funds for the health
clinic.JOIN US IN CREATING A HEALTHIER FUTURE FOR THE PEOPLE OF PALAWAN            Paul Wooden and Teresa Tirol are creating Wild Dharma because we are both passionate about participating in life in a way that
contributes to a better world and we understand that more and more people are
feeling the same way. Wild Dharma, along with its eco resort and yoga, meditation and
health programs is dedicated to projects that promote personal wellbeing,
social responsibility and environmental sustainability;  a development that adds value to local
communities and thus provide opportunities for families and children here in
Palawan to have a better future.  Paul has been studying, practicing and teaching yoga and
meditation for over 25 years. Having run a successful yoga school and healing
centre in Melbourne, Australia for many years he has since been working towards
the creating the more socially integrated vision of Wild Dharma.Teresa
is a GP and spent two years working as a community doctor here in Palawan and
has since been working towards more effective ways to serve the local health
needs here. She is also an avid foodie with a keen interest in the relationship between diet and health in Palawan.We need your help to raise the USD$60,000.Your contributions will help us establish a simple health clinic building with necessary equipment and outreach and the first stages of a solar power system to power it. Any extra money will go towards the renovation of our very basic kitchen.This health clinic will be the first stage in our longer term vision of a more integral approach to all the health concerns in the area. This includes a chronic poverty induced dis-empowerment and poor education opportunities.The NumbersThe clinic will provide the sorely needed healthcare in the
area. Teresa worked in Palawan as a community GP for two years
and knows firsthand the many health issues the local people
face.  Most, if not all, children here suffer from malnutrition. This compromised condition gives rise to stunted growth, skin infections, and tuberculosis among other things. These are are preventable
and treatable conditions.
                  In adults, heart attacks and strokes result from unchecked
hypertension. Pneumonia, diabetes and tuberculosis also commonly go undiagnosed.  These are are preventable and treatable conditions.Nobody would die from these ailments if they had access to
treatment.There is a limited health station further up the coast, but with
limited resources locals cannot afford to travel let alone pay for
any required treatment if they do make it there.  Access to healthcare in these poor and far flung
villages is difficult, if not impossible. If you don’t have money here, you don’t receive health care. It’s as simple as that. This serious lack of access to healthcare contributes
to this vicious cycle of poverty and disempowerment. This is
costing young people their shot at a better future and, in some cases, it is
costing young lives. Our aim is to change this situation and with your help we can get started by attending to immediate health issues
while we work towards more integrated solutions.By supporting our small clinic the local communities will have
access to free health care. Often simply addressing things early staves off
problems later.With this health clinic, we hope to provide primary healthcare:
medical checkups, treatments, as well as provide basic medications and address
food/nutrition issues in the local gradeschool. This health clinic is the first step towards a more integral
health program in the area.  This will
establish a platform for our social and environmental programs which will
eventually integrate education and livelihood options that will
empower the locals and give them opportunities for a healthier
future.But for now, our main focus in on the health clinic and the
immediate health concerns here.      Your help is deeply appreciated and to show our
appreciation we have set out some insanely good value rewards for you.We are offering great deals on holidays and retreats here with
us in Palawan. We would really love you to make Wild Dharma your next holiday
where you can not only enjoy the stunning beauty of Palawan but also see for
yourself how your contribution is giving back to the local communities.Treat yourself or buy an amazing Christmas present for friends
and family.A Christmas present that gives twice. First to your gift
recipient and then to the local people in our area here in Palawan.. So please
check them out. YOUR NEXT HOLIDAY WILL BRING REAL VALUE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES
      THESE ARE OUR PERKS    Please note all prices are in USD                                               We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially. If you support our project, you can still help in the following ways:

<p>Our eclectic book selection is carefully curated with the community in mind. From children's books to local interest, history and religion, we hope that you're always able to find a book that piques your interest. </p>
<p><b>We opened the Scottsville chapter of 'Baine's Books &amp; Coffee' nearly three (3) years ago</b> with little more than an innate intuition that a ""Baine's"" would work in small, historic Scottsville, Va. <b>On November 30th, 2015 we will be entering our 4th year of business!</b> We are super excited about this enormous step and want to celebrate by making even larger strides in year four.

</h3>
<p><b>PHASE #1: <i>EXTERIOR REVAMP</i></b><br/></p>
<p><b>Let's be real. Our store front looks like a house. Not a business. A house.</b> And there's good reason for this, considering the fact that it was, initially, built as a house. Lifelong Scottsville resident, Edna Anderson used to spend many a day in our shop, since it was once her grandmother's home. How cool is that?!<br/></p>
<p>Don't get us wrong. We like the house look. It makes our presence on Valley Street unique. However, it's incredibly hard for people who are not already familiar with 'Baine's Scottsville' to notice that we're here. <b>There's only so much that a neon sign and an A-frame chalkboard can do</b>, especially when they are only present during open business hours. When we're closed, people simply see 'a house.'</p>

<p>The plan was always to have a<b> hanging sign</b>, but once we got the business up and running our focus shifted to the interior, and outdoor signage just never got off the ground. <br/></p>
<p>The first portion of funds that this campaign is set to raise will go toward <b>enhancing our storefront, helping it look a little less like a house and a little more like a bona fide business</b>. <i>(See rendering below)</i></p>

</div></div>","We Love Books & Coffee
 It is not just our business, it's our passion. 
We're dedicated to bringing the Scottsville community the very best in locally roasted coffee (Shark Mountain Coffee Co. & Lexington Coffee Roasters), and pride ourselves in crafting delicious house-made pastries. 
Our eclectic book selection is carefully curated with the community in mind. From children's books to local interest, history and religion, we hope that you're always able to find a book that piques your interest. 
We opened the Scottsville chapter of 'Baine's Books & Coffee' nearly three (3) years ago with little more than an innate intuition that a ""Baine's"" would work in small, historic Scottsville, Va. On November 30th, 2015 we will be entering our 4th year of business! We are super excited about this enormous step and want to celebrate by making even larger strides in year four. To make these strides we need to accomplish three (3) key phases that will help us continue our mission of bringing good books and great coffee to the Scottsville community. 



  Baine's Scottsville --- Project 3.0 

PHASE #1: EXTERIOR REVAMP
Let's be real. Our store front looks like a house. Not a business. A house. And there's good reason for this, considering the fact that it was, initially, built as a house. Lifelong Scottsville resident, Edna Anderson used to spend many a day in our shop, since it was once her grandmother's home. How cool is that?!
Don't get us wrong. We like the house look. It makes our presence on Valley Street unique. However, it's incredibly hard for people who are not already familiar with 'Baine's Scottsville' to notice that we're here. There's only so much that a neon sign and an A-frame chalkboard can do, especially when they are only present during open business hours. When we're closed, people simply see 'a house.'


The plan was always to have a hanging sign, but once we got the business up and running our focus shifted to the interior, and outdoor signage just never got off the ground. 
The first portion of funds that this campaign is set to raise will go toward enhancing our storefront, helping it look a little less like a house and a little more like a bona fide business. (See rendering below)


Oh yeah! That's better :)PHASE #2 : EQUIPMENT UPGRADEThere's no denying that we need an equipment upgrade. We are dedicated to brewing all of our coffee manually, so that you receive the best, most flavorful cup every time you visit. Manually brewing coffee takes time as it is, but it could go a lot faster with the help of a hot water tower. We currently have to wait for our hot water kettle to reach temperature before we are able to even begin the batch brewing process. With a brand new hot water tower we'd be able to begin brewing in the time that it takes to grind the coffee...pretty quick! This will allow our customers to be served in a much speedier fashion. 
(Coffee brewing at its finest.)PHASE #3: LIGHTING, LIGHTING, LIGHTING!Lighting plays a huge role in a space's presentation. We want our shop's atmosphere to be both inviting and relaxing, which we found to be insanely difficult with three glaring florescent lights right above the espresso bar. We started leaving these three lights off two years ago, and customers immediately noticed and applauded the difference. Since then, we've fashioned a series of lamps around the area. They help with the ambiance, but do little to fully light the space. We'd really like to replace the florescent fixtures with energy efficient, directional LEDs, so that the espresso bar can be fully lit in all of its shot pulling, milk steaming glory!

can even work in the businesses that are already established in the Redeem
Center or rooms can be designated for business incubators for the most
dedicated students to start their own businesses.  They will pay rent based off of their

6.  80% of this has been done by the
financial contributions of less than 5 people.
7.  95% of the work has been done by
approximately 10 people who volunteer.
WHAT DO WE NEED?
1.  We need more volunteers.
2.  We need a heating and plumbing system
in our School Building because someone broke in and stole the pipes and
radiators.
3.  Financial donations to pay skilled
staff members and teachers
4.  Someone who can advise us on how to
use what we have to start the businesses and generate income.
5. 
Once the buildings are fully operational and
the businesses are started, we can use the revenue to run our programs and we
will be self-sustaining.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><div>Thank you for visiting our indiegogo page! You can help support local business  by helping to open the first float center in Shreveport! If you suffer from any type of illness, chronic pain, or just daily life stresses, floating is for you! We believe in our community and we want to help others so  <b>We will donate 5% of all funds raised to St. Jude's Children's Hospital and 5% to the Shriners Hospital of Shreveport! </b>
</div><p><br/></p><div>
<h3>So, what exactly is floating?</h3>
<div>We're glad you asked! Floating, which is also known as sensory deprivation, is the practice of getting in a float tank (just larger than a bathtub in most cases) filled with water and lying on your back with the intention of reducing sensory input. The water in a float tank is usually 10’, but no more than 12’ deep. Pharmaceutical grade epsom salt is added to the water (800-1,200 lbs.) By adding the epsom salt we achieve the specific gravity of between 1.265 and 1.285 (the dead sea has specific gravity of 1.24!) This creates buoyancy so you float effortlessly, thus removing the feeling of gravity from your body. The water is heated to the same temperature as your skin which is 93.5 F. The inside of the tank is pitch black and soundproof. The person floating normally wears earplugs, and their ears are submerged under water as well.</div>
<div><p><br/></p></div>
<b>So, why floating?</b>
</div><div>
<br/>The point of floating is to remove or reduce sensory input to the brain allowing the left, more dominant hemisphere of your brain to take a break. When this is accomplished the right side is able to stretch its legs. Removing your sensory input allows your body to RELAX and actually LOWERS cortisol levels (the chemical component of stress.) Your brain also releases HIGHER levels dopamine and endorphins, neurotransmitters of HAPPINESS. <br/><br/>In the tank you are ESCAPING gravity, imagine how relaxed you could be in outer space(providing you can breath and all.) When you float your body doesn't have to do things like support your weight, or regulate temperature so your brain is able to send all of its resources to where they are needed for HEALING. <br/><br/>Another benefit of floating is the fact that after a while in the tank your brain shifts to producing Theta brain waves. The Theta state is a level of consciousness that can take people who meditate years to achieve. It is the state we are in just before we go to sleep at night and just after we wake up. It is also seen in children. <br/><br/>Floating is a natural way to relieve chronic pain from things like arthritis and fibromyalgia. People with sore muscles and achy bones also get benefits. Due to the freedom of gravity your spine actually lengthens an inch.<br/><br/>EPSON SALTS in the tank replenish your skin and your body absorbs the magnesium, helping with the deficiency most of us have due to depleted levels in our soil.<br/>
</div><div><b>Well, what are the benefits of floating?</b></div><div>The list is so long and thorough, basically everyone can benefit from floating in some fashion! </div><div>
<ul>
<li>Pain relief, whether caused by injury, such as a broken bone or a chronic illness, such as fibromyalgia, or arthritis.</li>
<li>Athletes can reap great benefits from floating as their muscles and injuries heal faster.</li>
<li>Women going through pregnancy can also find great relief in a float tank! Just the idea of being weightless can seem unreal to someone suddenly carrying 30 extra pounds, but they can also find relief from sciatic pain, back and joint pain, and just an overall relaxed feeling.</li>
<li>Stress relief; this is a very broad category, as stress can be the cause for so many other issues and illness. The relief from stress can help strengthen the immune system, but also relieve hypertension, depression, anxiety, compulsion disorders, and tension headaches. </li>
<li>Emotion pain is very real, and disorders such as PTSD, and postpartum depression can find very real relief in a floating environment.</li>
<li>Sleeping problems, including insomnia; you're brain is tricked into thinking you are sleeping, and drifts into a theta state, which is the most relaxed state of sleep your body can reach. </li>
<li>Enhanced creativity, and just an overall well-being.</li>
</ul>
<div>This is a short list. A little research into sensory deprivation can reveal an endless number of problems and issues floating benefits. </div>

<h3>The Plan</h3>
Emerge Float Spa will be so much more than just a float center! James and Christin want Emerge to be an all around wellness center and an experience you can't find in shreveport, where there will be a number of ways to achieve a healthier and more relaxed state of being! In addition to floating where you'll be able to choose between state of the art rooms or a Samadhi tank, other services will include massage rooms, a single and couples room and Himalayan salt saunas! These great creations work like a regular sauna, heating up and causing the user to sweat out toxins. Salt saunas have a one-up, however, helping to replenish the body by heating up pink himalayan rocks and releasing the essential 84 minerals and trace elements our bodies need. We will also offer bottled health drinks, and health books for those ready to dive into a healthier lifestyle! After you experience a range of relaxation methods, we hope you'll stay awhile longer and experience our relaxation room! A cool, dimly lit room, it will offer additional services, like an oxygen bar, and a RIFE machine. The RIFE machine uses specific frequencies from the 3500 frequency list book to stimulate a altering of bioresonance in the cells, reversing the change caused by the disease. Transmitting these frequencies over the same electrodes ( vibration straps) over a period of time generates healing signals that have the curative effect. With this method of treatment, practitioners claim to be able to detect and cure a variety of diseases and addictions without drugs. Finished off with comfy chairs, books and saltwater aquarium, we hope you'll agree its the perfect place to finish up the ultimate relaxation experience!   </div><div><b>Perks</b></div><div>T-shirts, coupons and gift cards will be sent as soon as our campaign ends, while floating, massage and the sauna will be available once we open our doors. Our goal is to be open around July of 2016!</div><div><br/></div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our biggest obstacle is funding, as this is our start-up business, however, that's why we've created this page! Helping us reach our goal will not only give us the start-up funding we need, for possible loans, but will also help our investors see just how serious we are about this!</p>

</p><p>Hi, I'm Samantha and am currently a
resident on the Westside section of Los Angeles. I volunteer within other
organizations within the communities and there is absolutely no way not to
notice the large homeless population along our coast. Many notice, many ignore
and while I cannot fix the problem we face here in Los Angeles County, I can at
least bring some dignity to those in need by distributing tangible items versus
throwing cash at the issue at hand.</p>
<p>Ladies (and
Gents), every month Aunt Flo comes to visit. Now, think about if you didn’t
have the financial resources to buy feminine hygiene products? Think about if
the only barrier you had were cloth rags or toilet paper found in public
restrooms to block the blood stream. Think about how amazing it feels at the
end of the day to take your bra off, but then imagine how uncomfortable it
would be to walk around all day without one. Or, be wearing a bra that does not
fit properly. Now, imagine being outside for prolong periods of time with cold
feet, or walking around in snug shoes without socks. Then, factor this in on
top of not having basic needs such as food or shelter. Shelters and food banks
do amazing work and I am not here to step on their toes, rather I am working to
supplement and provide some dignity and comfort to these ladies (and men).
These small things such as tampons, pads, bras, and even socks, things we all
take for granted, can provide a small amount of dignity and comfort to others
in need.</p>
<p>We continue to help the less fortunate in
foreign countries. Yes, I am human, I feel for them, but we need to open our
eyes and look within our own communities to see what's right in front of us. While I cannot fix the homeless population, we as a collective can provide
dignity to these women (and men). I understand many of you do not have
the time or knowledge of how to help. I also understand that this is an after
thought to your own obligations to yourself and family. This is why I am here.
I can purchase these items, deliver to shelters, distribute to the population I
see daily along the streets and beaches. I am ok with doing the work, but I
cannot fund this project on my own. The reality is, I know for many it is
easier to donate money and have others do the work. You can feel good, maybe
share your experience with others and have others want to feel good? The cycle
of helping and being kind is endless.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, feminine hygiene products
are not cheap nor are they readily accessible to the non-homeless population,
so if I can provide that one thing we all take for granted we are moving in the
right direction. ALL funds will be used to purchase, donate and distribute the
feminine hygiene products, ladies undergarments and socks, no matter what level
we reach! Thankfully, I am a penny pincher and know to look for sales and
coupons to make the funds stretch. Coupon clippers and sale shoppers, let’s
talk. These items I am looking to distribute are always in need and there will
never be enough as long as there is a homeless population. I understand many of
you looking at this campaign do not live along the Los Angeles
coastline. Yet, there is no reason we cannot make this project grow into
other cities. Many people have crowd-funded and started nonprofits focused on
similar ideas throughout the country. Join the movement.</p>
<p>The most
important way to help is to get the word out. I am the first person to
understand that you may not be able to contribute to this campaign financially,
but your support through social media shares and word of mouth is greatly
appreciated. Please take the time to share this campaign and most
importantly talk about it.  I have set up Facebook, Instagram and Twitter
accounts to get the word out and share ideas and coupons? In addition, if you
are local and feel more comfortable donating these items we can make an
arrangement for drop-offs. We can all make a difference in someone's life and
bring some dignity to our communities!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My
name is Rafael Linero, currently I am a master student in electronic
engineering at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in
Bogotá-Colombia. Four years ago I started to work with renewable energy and I knew
that at Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta there are indigenous
and coffee farmers communities that have to walk more than 3 hours to find electricity and to
charge their cell phones and flashlights.</p>
<p><b><i>The
importance of this campaign</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">According
to The World Bank and the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Colombia
approximately 1.5 million people lack access to electricity service, and a
large percentage of the population of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta does not
have this service because this area is not interconnected to the power grid.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With
this campaign, I intend, with the help of all of you, to take this friendly technology
to the environment, portable solar energy systems, to improve the
quality of life of indigenous and coffee farmers communities  of Sierra
Nevada de Santa Marta.</p>
<p><b><i>A
campaign with impact</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By making real this campaign at least 21 families living at Sierra Nevada de
Santa Marta will have electricity for the first time in their lives, because they have a system with which charge their cell and illuminate their
houses.</p>
<p><span>They</span> <span>will use environmentally friendly energy.</span></p>
<p></p>

I
have worked taking these solutions  to  these  communities.  In  following pictures you can  see  some  examples, with your help we can continue taking these technologies
to these communities.<br/>
<p></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>In
case of no collect all the funds for this campaign, the collected funds will implement the systems as possible and make your donations.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>They
can be more beneficiary families with these solar systems, everything depends

<p>During

<p><br/></p><p>QandA </p>
<p>These are actual questions we have been
asked in the past week, I hope these answers are helpful.</p>
<p><b>Aren’t you making heaps of
money?</b></p>
<p>No I am not. It’s harder than it looks to run a small business,
especially a food related business. There are so many laws and regulations to
comply with. </p>
<p>I understand when customers come in at lunch time on a Saturday it
looks like we must be making a bomb but it’s not that simple. Very few
businesses see profit in the first few years and most even go bust. We have had
our wins and setbacks like any small business but last year we had more than
our fare share of building related set backs, fridge breakdowns &amp; a robbery,
that have taken their toll on our progress. </p>
<p><b>Didn’t you know your lease
was coming up for renewal?</b></p>
<p>Yes I did. My long term plan was to renew the lease and keep the
café in the space but move the food production area to a little industrial unit
somewhere as soon as I could afford it. But the new lease comes with a rent
rise I am unable to pay. So I can’t renew the lease and stay. </p>
<p><b>Surely a big company like
yours can pay its own way?</b></p>
<p>I am a sole trader not a company. I am considered a micro business
which is smaller than a small business, and even that is being generous. There
is a cost related to becoming a company and I have not yet had the spare $ to make
the change. Once my business starts becoming profitable I will change to a company
to receive certain tax breaks that are not available to sole traders. </p>
<p><b>Why don’t you just get a
loan?</b></p>
<p>I was only able to open Suzy Spoon’s Vegetarian Butcher because my
partner and I took out a bank loan, which we are still paying off. </p>
<p><b>What will you do if you
don’t raise the funds you need?</b></p>
<p>I will do what I can, with what I have. My business might need to
start from the beginning again with a small kitchen in the suburbs and a
weekend market stall. </p>
<p>The products are my priority over my café. So if I can’t find a
space for both together I will look for a space for the food production
workshop and close the café indefinitely. </p>
<p><b>Why do you need a food
production space why not just open the café?</b></p>
<p>Suzy Spoon’s Vegetarian Butcher is a food production business, with
a café where you can taste the products we make. Without the products I don’t
really have a café, because that is what makes my cafe so special and different
from other cafes, the menu is made up of the products we make. </p>
<p><b>There are heaps of empty
shops that are really cheap, why can’t you just move into one of them?</b></p>
<p>It’s not impossible but there are complications. </p>
<p>My funds are limited so the place I move into needs to have a few
things so I can make my products safely, hygienically and within the council,
Sydney water and NSW health’s regulations. For example cool rooms, floor
drains, grease trap and an exhaust extractor. I need 3 phase power, gas and the
space needs to be approved by the council for food use.  When I moved into the Newtown property
there was no grease trap and it cost $20,000 to have one put in. </p>
<p>Even to open a small café the building needs to have been approved
for food use by the council, and if I want to do any cooking at all I need a
grease trap and exhaust. </p>
<p><b>What will you spend the
money on?</b></p>
<p>I am still looking for a space to move to. So it’s hard to know what
problems I will face. But I will post regular updates on our progress. </p>
<p>The money will be spent on moving the food production side of the business
to a new location. If I can open a café in that location I will. But if I cant
I will then look for a space where I can open the café. </p>
<p>At this point we will need roughly $20,000 for the bond on a new
building. But we will hopefully get our bond back from our Newtown shop at the
end of May. </p>
<p>We need to buy a new Bratt pan which is a giant electric fry pan
($3000 second hand), and a combi steam oven ($4000 second hand). It is unlikely
we will be able to afford these new but newer than the ones we have would be
great, as I don’t think the ones we have will survive a move.  </p>

asked in the past week, I hope these answers are helpful.
Aren’t you making heaps of
money?
No I am not. It’s harder than it looks to run a small business,
especially a food related business. There are so many laws and regulations to
comply with. 
I understand when customers come in at lunch time on a Saturday it
looks like we must be making a bomb but it’s not that simple. Very few
businesses see profit in the first few years and most even go bust. We have had
our wins and setbacks like any small business but last year we had more than
our fare share of building related set backs, fridge breakdowns & a robbery,
that have taken their toll on our progress. 
Didn’t you know your lease
was coming up for renewal?
Yes I did. My long term plan was to renew the lease and keep the
café in the space but move the food production area to a little industrial unit
somewhere as soon as I could afford it. But the new lease comes with a rent
rise I am unable to pay. So I can’t renew the lease and stay. 
Surely a big company like
yours can pay its own way?
I am a sole trader not a company. I am considered a micro business
which is smaller than a small business, and even that is being generous. There
is a cost related to becoming a company and I have not yet had the spare $ to make
the change. Once my business starts becoming profitable I will change to a company
to receive certain tax breaks that are not available to sole traders. 
Why don’t you just get a
loan?
I was only able to open Suzy Spoon’s Vegetarian Butcher because my
partner and I took out a bank loan, which we are still paying off. 
What will you do if you
don’t raise the funds you need?
I will do what I can, with what I have. My business might need to
start from the beginning again with a small kitchen in the suburbs and a
weekend market stall. 
The products are my priority over my café. So if I can’t find a
space for both together I will look for a space for the food production
workshop and close the café indefinitely. 
Why do you need a food
production space why not just open the café?
Suzy Spoon’s Vegetarian Butcher is a food production business, with
a café where you can taste the products we make. Without the products I don’t
really have a café, because that is what makes my cafe so special and different
from other cafes, the menu is made up of the products we make. 
There are heaps of empty
shops that are really cheap, why can’t you just move into one of them?
It’s not impossible but there are complications. 
My funds are limited so the place I move into needs to have a few
things so I can make my products safely, hygienically and within the council,
Sydney water and NSW health’s regulations. For example cool rooms, floor
drains, grease trap and an exhaust extractor. I need 3 phase power, gas and the
space needs to be approved by the council for food use.  When I moved into the Newtown property
there was no grease trap and it cost $20,000 to have one put in. 
Even to open a small café the building needs to have been approved
for food use by the council, and if I want to do any cooking at all I need a
grease trap and exhaust. 
What will you spend the
money on?
I am still looking for a space to move to. So it’s hard to know what
problems I will face. But I will post regular updates on our progress. 
The money will be spent on moving the food production side of the business
to a new location. If I can open a café in that location I will. But if I cant
I will then look for a space where I can open the café. 
At this point we will need roughly $20,000 for the bond on a new
building. But we will hopefully get our bond back from our Newtown shop at the
end of May. 
We need to buy a new Bratt pan which is a giant electric fry pan
($3000 second hand), and a combi steam oven ($4000 second hand). It is unlikely
we will be able to afford these new but newer than the ones we have would be
great, as I don’t think the ones we have will survive a move.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>My Name is <strong>Nadege Fleurimond </strong>and I am a caterer, author, and event planner in NYC. For years one of our clients absolute favorite dessert has been my Challah bread pudding served with coconut rum sauce known as <i><strong>Kremas</strong></i>. Soft, decadent and downright well...I will say it...ORGASMIC!!! The taste usually results in knees buckling, followed by eyes being rolled back, with exclamations of<strong> ""OH MY GOD OPRAH NEEDS TO TASTE THIS""</strong>.</p>
<p>It took me a while to understand that meant people really liked it and thought it so delicious that they figured if Oprah tasted it, it would easily become one of her favorite things. So I started to say it too...whenever people complimented me on it, I would say, yeah, if only Oprah could taste it!</p>
<p>And one day this past Christmas weekend after stating, ""yeah if only we could get Oprah to taste it"" my friend Florence Taylor, wrote me back and said, ""send it to her!"".</p>
<p>I said, you know what, I think I will. Hence the<b> CHALLENGE!!! #oprahbreadpuddingchallenge</b></p>

<p>I believe we can get someone to order one of the bread puddings for Oprah herself. Do you know Oprah? Well don't worry. Most of us don't know Oprah.

<p>Can't think of anyone specific? Send it to the biggest connector you know. Send it to a pastor friend, a mortgage broker, someone in the mail room, a gym buddy.

After 5 years on the job, the City of Oakland closed down the arena and I was without a job. My love of doing security work led me to continue to pursue a career in the field with different security companies. My everyday consists of customer service, providing security and safety to people from all over the world, and truly connecting with the people that I help. After over 15 years working for security company after company, learning all about security while in the profession, I developed a drive to start my own security company.  I am passionate about my field, driven by the love of keeping people safe and I am dedicated to offering customer service everyday. CheckN Security!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Give &amp; Take</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In early 2015, while at her Bridal Shower in New Mexico, Lauren received the call from her fiancé Joe in Nevada, telling her that Mocha Bean, her dog of 10 years was lost to the desert. Amazingly, two months later Lauren still married Joe.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In August, Lauren returned to New Mexico. The desert had a gift waiting for her there. Two Doberman-mix puppies – sisters! – had been left at the shelter after being found in the desert. Lauren packed them up and drove Scarlett &amp; Sage home to Nevada.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472860522/wnhivtfvasggmistfavl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Two Bitch™ Bourbon</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">For years, Joe &amp; Lauren have held whiskey parties at their home bar, appropriately called the Luby Saloon. A few months ago, they were designing an invitation to a whiskey party and wanted to incorporate the new dogs into the design. The result was Two Bitch™ Bourbon, named for Scarlett &amp; Sage!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It started as a fun bourbon bottle mock-up on the invitation, but everyone thought it was a great idea for a new brand of bourbon and spirits. Thus, Two Bitch Spirits Ltd., and Two Bitch™ Bourbon were born!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are planning a full line of spirits including multiple bourbon editions (e.g., cask strength, single barrel, etc.) as well as other whiskey profiles. The first product available commercially will be our unaged whiskey (moonshine). It will be distilled using the same recipe as our standard bourbon. At the same time, our first batch of bourbon will go into the barrels to begin the maturation process. We also expect to bring a blended product to the market in the first few months following the Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Overall, whiskeys aged in the desert climate tend to mature faster and compare very favorably with longer-aged batches from more moderate regions. Ultimately, it’s all about you! The more funds we can raise through this Indiegogo campaign, then the more juice we can put in barrels and the more variety of products we can bring to the market sooner.</p>

Give & Take
In early 2015, while at her Bridal Shower in New Mexico, Lauren received the call from her fiancé Joe in Nevada, telling her that Mocha Bean, her dog of 10 years was lost to the desert. Amazingly, two months later Lauren still married Joe.
In August, Lauren returned to New Mexico. The desert had a gift waiting for her there. Two Doberman-mix puppies – sisters! – had been left at the shelter after being found in the desert. Lauren packed them up and drove Scarlett & Sage home to Nevada.

Two Bitch™ Bourbon
For years, Joe & Lauren have held whiskey parties at their home bar, appropriately called the Luby Saloon. A few months ago, they were designing an invitation to a whiskey party and wanted to incorporate the new dogs into the design. The result was Two Bitch™ Bourbon, named for Scarlett & Sage!
It started as a fun bourbon bottle mock-up on the invitation, but everyone thought it was a great idea for a new brand of bourbon and spirits. Thus, Two Bitch Spirits Ltd., and Two Bitch™ Bourbon were born!
 

 

We are planning a full line of spirits including multiple bourbon editions (e.g., cask strength, single barrel, etc.) as well as other whiskey profiles. The first product available commercially will be our unaged whiskey (moonshine). It will be distilled using the same recipe as our standard bourbon. At the same time, our first batch of bourbon will go into the barrels to begin the maturation process. We also expect to bring a blended product to the market in the first few months following the Indiegogo campaign.
Overall, whiskeys aged in the desert climate tend to mature faster and compare very favorably with longer-aged batches from more moderate regions. Ultimately, it’s all about you! The more funds we can raise through this Indiegogo campaign, then the more juice we can put in barrels and the more variety of products we can bring to the market sooner.
 


Some things just fall into place! As we searched for a distillery partner we found George Racz, Founder and Master Distiller of the Las Vegas Distillery. George wrote the Nevada distillery law and became the first legal distiller in the state. 

We want YOU to be part of our story! Join the good times by helping fund our Indiegogo.com campaign. You’ll be a permanent member of our Distiller’s Circle and will be part of Two Bitch Spirits Ltd. history. You will be recognized on a special page on our website as an early supporter! You'll also receive early access to new limited-release products, special offers, and invitations to special events. If you love dogs, bourbon, and good times, then you need to be in the Distiller's Circle!
 



This perk level has it all! Receive a Two Bitch Bourbon 2L Oak Barrel, 3 Vouchers for Two Bitch Unaged Whiskey (moonshine) - enough to fill the barrel w/ some leftover! - Voucher for a Limited Edition Founder's Bottle of Two Bitch Bourbon (won't be sold in stores), Distiller's Circle T-shirt, Hat, Bandana & 2 Shot Glasses! Great as gift items too! Shipping in time for Christmas!
$250

 
 


Make sure your dog gets one of our Two Bitch™ Bourbon Bandanas. Send us your best photo of your pooch sporting their stylish bandana and we will add them to our Two Bitch™ Bourbon Bandana Buddies web page.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We've been on the hunt for several years for the next statement-making venue (where you can do <i>almost</i> anything), and recently found the cutest spot at the RiverPlace on Green Street near the Riverwalk in the heart of downtown McHenry, IL!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There's two units in vanilla box condition between Kiera Confections, High Volume Hair Salon, and BuddyZ that we will combine into one beautiful 2,800 square foot space.

We will rarely restrict you from being able to decide what you want to have--it's your event after all.</p>
<p>Pricing will be slightly higher than our Woodstock venue due to the increased expenses, but it will still be an affordable option for customers versus traditional venues.

<p>
</p><p>With this campaign, we hope to raise additional funds to bring you an even more exciting show than the one we are already brining this year.  It is important to us, and to you, for our convention to stand out from the pack.  In an area such as Bryan/College Station, there is a higher chance that a successful, highly attended comic convention can impact the local businesses by attracting out of town attendees.  One of the best ways to attract fans from out of town is by presenting guests that they haven’t had the opportunity to meet elsewhere in the state.  By helping us ensure the success of this years event, you also help to ensure the existence of next years event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this campaign we are attempting to raise a minimum of $35,000.  Yes, you’re correct, that is quite a bit of money.  If you choose to support us, your donation will go toward the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Securing guests.   Appearance fees, flights, and hotel rooms can add up rather quickly.  Whether they are from the comics industry or entertainment industry, this is where the lions share of the funds will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Hotel for our volunteers.   Thanks to the BOSS program at Fort Hood, our volunteer force is comprised of active duty soldiers.  Part of the arrangement is for us to provide lodging for them, but, sadly, before we had confirmation of their involvement this year, our budget was at its end.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Advertising.  While we will of course be advertising on TV, radio, and internet, we also want billboards.  While we have some existing budget for the other venues, billboards are Expensive, and surprisingly so.   We’d like to have some up before the college semester starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To pique your interest and inspire you to help, we have some amazing (and some odd) perks for you to take advantage of.   Ranging from a simple Thank You to staring in one of our off-beat commercials to owning an original piece of art by a legendary comic artist…there is bound to be something that catches your eye.  </p>
<p> In our “Amped!” tier alone, you have the opportunity to receive an exclusive VIP badge that gains you entrance to not only the con, but to any afterparty, opening ceremony, or other event associated with the con.  It also features exclusive art that was created for us by Adam Kubert!  It is unsure whether or not Adam’s artwork has ever been used on a con badge before, but this is definitely the first time a con in Texas has had the opportunity to feature such an item.  You can take part in history!  Plus, if you head over to our Facebook page, you can have a say in what the final art will be!  </p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the great things about IndieGoGo compared to other similar services…we do not have to reach our goal in order for you to help make a difference!   While meeting or exceeding our goal is the more desired outcome, if we don’t, we are able to take the support you’ve given us and, for lack of better phrasing, do the best we can with what we’ve got.  What this means is that every dollar helps us to add more to the event we already have, and every contribution is wholeheartedly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The biggest risk we are facing with this campaign is the availability of guests.  We have spoken with a number of celebrities, and while they are available on November 5th and 6th at the moment, that could change by the end of our campaign.  Not to worry, though.  We will still strive to bring you relevant and “rare” guests that you haven’t had an opportunity to meet elsewhere in the state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you can’t contribute to our convention at this time, don’t feel bad…we understand.   There are still ways you can help us, though.   Sharing the link on your social media pages is one of the quickest and easiest ways to help.  Adding a hashtag (even though they’re kind of lame) can help it reach even more people.   Our official hashtag is #BVCC, and we have been using #80sAwareness quite often, too.  #Deadpool always gets a lot of views, also….plus we already have a Deadpool artist booked at the con.</p>

The biggest risk we are facing with this campaign is the availability of guests.  We have spoken with a number of celebrities, and while they are available on November 5th and 6th at the moment, that could change by the end of our campaign.  Not to worry, though.  We will still strive to bring you relevant and “rare” guests that you haven’t had an opportunity to meet elsewhere in the state.


If you can’t contribute to our convention at this time, don’t feel bad…we understand.   There are still ways you can help us, though.   Sharing the link on your social media pages is one of the quickest and easiest ways to help.  Adding a hashtag (even though they’re kind of lame) can help it reach even more people.   Our official hashtag is #BVCC, and we have been using #80sAwareness quite often, too.  #Deadpool always gets a lot of views, also….plus we already have a Deadpool artist booked at the con.

Thank you again for taking the time to visit our page.  We appreciate your support in any form",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Organicburgr Project: Helping Communities Rise.</h3>
<p>Motivating people every day to improve the lives of others through enjoyment of nutritious organic food.</p>
<p>The charitable <a href=""http://www.organicburgr.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Organicburgr project</a> sprouted from 3 basic beliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>To harness the power of organic food</li>
<li>To create equal employment opportunity for millennials</li>
<li>To improve the lives of young families with children</li>
</ul>
<p>The driving forces behind the Organicburgr project aim to change people’s approach and outlook on animal rearing, meat consumption, the benefit of local trade and to create fair employment opportunities for young people from underprivileged backgrounds. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We aim to elevate community life through sales of organic burgers (from our pop-up food cart) to help millennials &amp; families with young children live better lives and to build a prosperous and sustainable future for generations to come.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Organicburgr project will launch its pilot programme in London, Summer 2017</strong>, serving:</p>
<p>Healthy, mouth-watering Organic Burgers &amp; fresh fruit Smoothies from a pop-up food cart. The gourmet patties are grilled over an open flame fuelled by wood using prime cuts of 100% organic, locally sourced meat and are made fresh to order.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Harnessing the power of organic food</h3>
<p>We introduce a convenient yet healthy and organic lunch option into people’s lives by serving tasty handcrafted burgers &amp; smoothies prepared from sustainable organic ingredients sourced locally.</p>
<h3>Creating Equal Opportunity for Millennials</h3>
<p>We support local communities by employing young people from troubled backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Improving the lives of others</h3>
<p>We donate organic food, educational toys and adventure days out to families in need of ongoing support.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>So how do we do it?</u></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Easy.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">(Well, not that easy, but nonetheless, worthwhile.)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>We sell our organic and handcrafted burgers and smoothies prepared from local organic fruit and veg from our pop-up food cart and use the proceeds to invest into the local community.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Let's talk burgers. </u></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Burgers are one of the culinary world’s most popular and tastiest creations. (No argument there, José!)</h3>

<p>A recent survey conducted by DEFRA and the office for national statistics calculated the average UK household spend on food that could have been eaten but is thrown away is around £470 a year. The Organicburgr project teamed up with a local Devon based farm which will supply us with 100% organic and sustainable produce including the premium beef, great tasting organic vegetables, artisan burger buns and fine local cheeses to complete the unique culinary experience.</p>
<p>The selection of fresh and organic fruit smoothies are season dependent. All fruits are grown in Devon, Kent and Essex. We Love food. Hate waste.</p>
<p>The Organicburgr project prides itself to overcome the issue of food waste. Our burgers are prepared daily from fresh organic produce. Any surplus meat, veg and fruit are donated to local food banks.</p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Margaret and Michael, the founders of the Organicburgr project, always had a passion for healthy foods and a strong interest for organic produce, local agriculture along with its interconnected effects on our lives. The notion towards a health conscious and balanced diet has only strengthened since they became first time parents to their daughter Maya in 2015.</p>
<p>The first London based pilot project will create five full time jobs. The new-hires will consist of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. One of the core aims of the Organicburgr project is to give those that are talented and willing to work a chance for meaningful full time employment at competitive wages and long term career prospects.<br/><br/>The hiring and placement process will be overseen by accredited London based charity organisations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Organicburgr project aims to make a difference in the lives of young people through secure full time employment and competitive wages.<br/> </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SOME SAY, MAKE A BETTER WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN. <br/>WE SAY, MAKE BETTER CHILDREN FOR OUR WORLD.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Poverty affects one in four children in the UK today. There were 3.9 million children living in poverty in the UK in 2014-15. That’s 28 per cent of children, or 9 in a classroom of 30. London is the area with the highest rates of child poverty in the country.</p>

</div></div>","Organicburgr Project: Helping Communities Rise.
Motivating people every day to improve the lives of others through enjoyment of nutritious organic food.
The charitable Organicburgr project sprouted from 3 basic beliefs:

To harness the power of organic food
To create equal employment opportunity for millennials
To improve the lives of young families with children

The driving forces behind the Organicburgr project aim to change people’s approach and outlook on animal rearing, meat consumption, the benefit of local trade and to create fair employment opportunities for young people from underprivileged backgrounds. 
 
We aim to elevate community life through sales of organic burgers (from our pop-up food cart) to help millennials & families with young children live better lives and to build a prosperous and sustainable future for generations to come.
 
The Organicburgr project will launch its pilot programme in London, Summer 2017, serving:
Healthy, mouth-watering Organic Burgers & fresh fruit Smoothies from a pop-up food cart. The gourmet patties are grilled over an open flame fuelled by wood using prime cuts of 100% organic, locally sourced meat and are made fresh to order.

Harnessing the power of organic food
We introduce a convenient yet healthy and organic lunch option into people’s lives by serving tasty handcrafted burgers & smoothies prepared from sustainable organic ingredients sourced locally.
Creating Equal Opportunity for Millennials
We support local communities by employing young people from troubled backgrounds.
Improving the lives of others
We donate organic food, educational toys and adventure days out to families in need of ongoing support.
 
So how do we do it?
Easy.
(Well, not that easy, but nonetheless, worthwhile.)
 
We sell our organic and handcrafted burgers and smoothies prepared from local organic fruit and veg from our pop-up food cart and use the proceeds to invest into the local community.
 
Let's talk burgers. 
Burgers are one of the culinary world’s most popular and tastiest creations. (No argument there, José!)

 
They come in a variety of combinations and options, yet more often than not does their consumption lead to health adverse effects due to the long and frightening list of ingredients such as GMO’s, trans fats, food dyes and other harmful food additives that are best avoided.
The driving forces behind the Organicburgr project aim to change people’s approach and outlook on animal rearing, meat consumption, the benefit of local trade and create fair employment opportunities for young people from troubled backgrounds.
 

 
We are proud to support
 

 
A recent survey conducted by DEFRA and the office for national statistics calculated the average UK household spend on food that could have been eaten but is thrown away is around £470 a year. The Organicburgr project teamed up with a local Devon based farm which will supply us with 100% organic and sustainable produce including the premium beef, great tasting organic vegetables, artisan burger buns and fine local cheeses to complete the unique culinary experience.
The selection of fresh and organic fruit smoothies are season dependent. All fruits are grown in Devon, Kent and Essex. We Love food. Hate waste.
The Organicburgr project prides itself to overcome the issue of food waste. Our burgers are prepared daily from fresh organic produce. Any surplus meat, veg and fruit are donated to local food banks.
 
You. The people behind the Organicburgr food revolution project. (Together. We are stronger.)
 

 
Margaret and Michael, the founders of the Organicburgr project, always had a passion for healthy foods and a strong interest for organic produce, local agriculture along with its interconnected effects on our lives. The notion towards a health conscious and balanced diet has only strengthened since they became first time parents to their daughter Maya in 2015.
The first London based pilot project will create five full time jobs. The new-hires will consist of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. One of the core aims of the Organicburgr project is to give those that are talented and willing to work a chance for meaningful full time employment at competitive wages and long term career prospects.The hiring and placement process will be overseen by accredited London based charity organisations.
 
The Organicburgr project aims to make a difference in the lives of young people through secure full time employment and competitive wages. 
SOME SAY, MAKE A BETTER WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN. WE SAY, MAKE BETTER CHILDREN FOR OUR WORLD.
 
Poverty affects one in four children in the UK today. There were 3.9 million children living in poverty in the UK in 2014-15. That’s 28 per cent of children, or 9 in a classroom of 30. London is the area with the highest rates of child poverty in the country.
The Organicburgr project is designed to donate 20% of its profits to families with young children.
To ensure that donations reach the families, we have taken the conscious decision to avoid cash donations.
Instead we have opted to make meaningful donations by regular food deliveries in partnership with our local farms. A selection of fresh and organic vegetable, fruit, meat and other food staples will be delivered to London and Essex based families on a weekly basis. As the Organicburgr project grows additional families will benefit from our programme.
