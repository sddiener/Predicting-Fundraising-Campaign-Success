<h3>No More Chains 2: It's Time For Change</h3>
<p>Filming NO MORE CHAINS 2 has been a thrilling adventure for several months. We're mighty excited to be at the finish line and have every intention of raising all the funds needed to assist in the healing of people who silently suffer from childhood and adult experiences that have traumatized them.</p>
<p>For this second series, we will be sharing stories of men and women who have overcome the odds of poverty, mental illnesses, homelessness, family shame and daddy issues, (to name a few), by tapping into their inner powers so that they could break chains to rewrite their stories and eventually achieve their purpose(s) in life.</p>
<p>No More Chains 2: It's Time for Change teaches through history and story-telling how to take steps to release the chains to create changes from the inside out, by facing your emotional, mental and generational chains, as well as healing and forgiving. </p>
<p><i>The No More Chains movement was erected to advance the intellectual and educational dialogue between members of the African-American race in a strong effort to bring solutions to the forefront and the problems to the back.</i></p>
<p>We are traveling across the country interviewing experts and sharing relatable inspirational stories of people who made the bold <i>it's time for change</i> decisions, discussing topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The history and downfall of the African-American father</li>
<li>Overcoming family shame in the African-American community</li>
<li>Taking responsibility for your actions and decisions which have led to self-inflicted personal trauma</li>
<li>How to reach deep into your energetic power to make change</li>
<li>How to heal from deep-rooted emotional, generational and relational wounds</li>
<li>How to unlearn societal expectations, traditions, and fallacies</li>
<li>Solutions to these issues</li>
</ul>
<p>...and so much more.</p>

<p><strong>King of The Road</strong> is a story that is inspired by old-school Looney Tunes and Hanna-Babera cartoons. With this child-like vision in mind, I plan to create a short film that brings a nostalgic feeling to the older audience, but also creates a humorous and comedic atmosphere that makes you turn to the person next to you and say, ‘Oi, that was actually mad’.

<p>We follow Frank, a man who, when he pulls to the side of an isolated road to relieve himself, encounters a wild Lion. Being stuck in the middle of the Australian nowhere, he must find ways to survive without being mauled by this beast. Frank realizes he has something the Lion desperately wants and uses this newfound knowledge to fuel his plans of escape. </p>

<h3>Why We believe ""Perpetuity"" is Both Timely and Important</h3>
<p>With the exposed allegations of Harvey Weinstein that shook our nation, and the consequent rise and empowerment of women sharing their abuses of the past, came next the fall of some of America's most prominent men.  The proliferation of ""Me Too"" and other movements have changed the course of history, not only in American, but worldwide. </p>
<p>This story is of a woman who had no chance to lead a productive life, as like many women, she has no recollection of the youthful trauma she experienced. They are buried memories she's repressed in order just to survive and exist.  ""Perpetuity"" is how this woman, in the most extreme and dire of circumstances, gets a second chance at life by finally facing the horrors of her youth as those painful memories stream unbidden back into her consciousness.</p>
<p>Jennifer Tremain is a maintenance worker at a large high-end office building, one of a string of jobs she's had as she struggles to maintain her self-destructive lifestyle. </p>
<p>On this particular morning, Jennifer has only just arrived at work when the room she's in suddenly implodes. The mirrors shatter, sending fragments in a hundred directions. The fire extinguisher dislodges and slams into Jennifer's throat, her body already thrown back across the room from the violent lurch of the entire room. The ceiling caves, the walls bend, the room is chaos. Jennifer lands on her back unconscious along with myriad debris.</p>
<p>When she wakes, Jennifer begins her fight for survival.  Almost mortally wounded, a shaft of metal having embedded her leg, a broken arm, and with no power of speech from her damaged throat, Jennifer must navigate the continually decaying room, fighting fire, falling water, building fragments, glass shards and smoke inhalation, all the while trying to seek some kind of rescue while dressing her own wounds in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
<p>It is in this hell . . . that she starts to remember.  To recall, little by little, the forgotten memories of the one other instance in her life that she had had to fight to survive.  </p>
<p>This story is about how a woman, faced with the most incredible crisis, fights for a chance to not only survive her current circumstances, but along the way finds surprisingly, and excruciatingly, the opportunity for the healing she has never experienced. </p>

<p>Patrick James Carson's recent screenplay was adapted into the motion picture ""9/11"" starring Whoopie Goldberg and Charlie Sheen, released theatrically worldwide late last year with video rights picked up and released this year by Fox Entertainment.  Mr. Carson has directed in the past, most notably the movie ""Deadly Ritual,"" but has focused on script writing for the past many years.  His works ""Elevator"" and ""The New American Candidate"" were produced into plays (Elevator is what was adapted into ""9/11""). </p>
<p>While several of his scripts have been purchased in recent years, his script ""Perpetuity"" renewed his desire to direct again, especially with the rise of abuse victims speaking out of late and after witnessing how his script for ""9/11"" was so drastically changed, and frankly destroyed, for the making of the film.</p>
<p>Mr. Carson has written over thirty screenplays, many that have sold and been made, and has directed over 20 films (shorts, corporate, feature) and dozens of commercials. He founded a film actor's workshop in Tucson, and also founded the ""personal and business newspaper"" tech company ""Makemynewspaper.com.""  </p>

<p>Alan Williams, with a film degree from the University of Arizona, has been shaping the Arizona film community for 20 years, with his career actually heating up of late.  He's won film festival awards for both writing and directing for his shorts, including ""Best of Arizona"" for his film, ""The Avenue"" at the Arizona International Film Festival. He is directing a web series (being made for Netflix) ""You Only Live Twice"" and just won ""Best Action Short"" at the Chandler Film Festival.</p>
<p>Alan's activity in the Southern Arizona motion picture world is well known, and even started the non-profit ""Picture Arizona"" to help bring the business and film communities to a better working relationship.  Alan, his wife and three children live in Tucson, Arizona. </p>
<h3>About the Production</h3>
<p>Even though ""Perpetuity"" is paced and action oriented, it actually only takes place in one location, with only one main actor.  This allows for a superior opportunity to make a low-budget, yet high production value looking motion picture.  Only one set is needed, and a minimal crew, to make this exciting, insightful film.  Shooting is scheduled to start this December.</p>
<p>Mr. Carson, through his founding of the Film Actor Workshops, has had the opportunity and honor of meeting the best filmmakers, film artists and film technicians in Arizona.  It is only with their support, and expertise, that this film can be made.  Together with Alan Williams and his reach and history with the collective film community, there is virtually no one in Arizona that won't be part of this endeavor.  </p>
<p>The money raised will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying the actor(s) and crew appropriately and feeding them.</li>
<li>Rent for location building.  A warehouse that has high ceilings and can facilitate interior rain (and even fire) shots (needs a drain).</li>
<li>Set construction material, including removable walls, ceilings, and decoration, both before the explosion and after.</li>
<li>Broadcast camera equipment, lighting, sound and post are all supplied by the hired crew.</li>
<li>Site Insurance</li>
</ul>

Mr. Carson, through his founding of the Film Actor Workshops, has had the opportunity and honor of meeting the best filmmakers, film artists and film technicians in Arizona.  It is only with their support, and expertise, that this film can be made.  Together with Alan Williams and his reach and history with the collective film community, there is virtually no one in Arizona that won't be part of this endeavor.  
The money raised will go to:

Paying the actor(s) and crew appropriately and feeding them.
Rent for location building.  A warehouse that has high ceilings and can facilitate interior rain (and even fire) shots (needs a drain).
Set construction material, including removable walls, ceilings, and decoration, both before the explosion and after.
Broadcast camera equipment, lighting, sound and post are all supplied by the hired crew.

<p>My name is Cory Xenos.  I attended The University of Kansas for Theatre/Film.  I found my forte to be directing, but I gained a vast knowledge of all parts of the creative process.  I've lived in LA for about 7 years, and am ready to use my voice and get behind the camera for my own project. By contributing to the campaign, you will be helping a longtime dream of filmmaking come true.  I believe I have an important and original story to tell.  Let's make it happen!</p>

<h3>As a Film Director</h3>
<p>I am very interested in the theme of Identity. Because of that, I like to build my stories around people that I know and that inspire me. Those people I try to preserve on screen. Through their characters, and their way of being, but also through their names. If my actress is Matilde then the character shall be Matilde!</p>
<p>Since my high school I really love and care for Art Direction, I specially have a strong passion for paper as a prop material. It started when I decided to do my first short movie, before enrolling in university. My friend scenographer Carla and I ended up using it to create scenarios and even clothing to fulfill the ideas I had. Was it a good movie? Well, I think any diretor who does her or his first movie will end up with something different from what they had in mind. One thing surprised me, however: The paper costumes and scenarios turned out to work incredibly well.  It was with this short film that character Matilde was born.</p>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Later in Cinema School I learned more about direction, production, writing, editing and above all cinematography which was the subject of my degree. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Completing my degree, I realized that I wanted to make a movie that can represent me as a diretor on screen. So, I picked up this script that I had been writing for about four years and decided to turn it into a movie. Actually it was a funny story that convinced me to make this film. I was on a bus when I found an old friend of mine from cinema school who had just returned from Cannes, where he had a film competing. We talked and eventually he asked me what I was doing. I told him that I had been writing a movie for a few years and that I kept dreaming about it. It seemed that the scenes were being played in my head. It seemed that the movie was talking to me. The bus stopped and my friend left wishing me the best of luck. I carried on with my bus travel until the lady sitting in front of me gets up and turned to me: ""You know young lady, if that dream follows you for that long it must have a meaning. Your heart is telling you that you really want to do this. So DO IT. If it goes wrong at least you've tried. If it goes well even better. But don't delay it anymore"" And she went off the bus. After that last push I knew that I just had to make this film .</div>

<h2>What is this movie about?</h2>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535146406/cfn4faj8xpbxr9ob3kk6.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>""Matilde and the Invisible Bird"" is a movie that explores themes like teenagehood, childhood and family. Inside the movie we have other secondary plots that explore the creativity between a child and his mother in writing a bedtime story, the relationship between brothers, friends, the community and the environment. </p>
<h3>Storyline</h3>
<p>It's bedtime for Marco so his mother and him invent a bedtime story about a girl named Matilde. But, as they go deeper into the story, the characters start coming to life, beginning to make their own choices and changing the final destiny of the history.</p>
<h3>Sinopsis</h3>
<p>Marco and his mother invent a bedtime story. Matilde is our main character and is on her summer vacation. She likes to spend her time riding her bicycle and making picnics with her friends. During one such picnic, Matilde hears a bird whistling like she never heard before. She knows a lot about birds but she can't recall what kind of species this one might be. Later that night Matilde dreams about the whistling bird and a small paper bicycle. On the following day, to her big surprise, Matilde finds the exact same bicycle from her dream standing right on her front door. From that moment on Matilde's life takes an even stranger path. Gradually Marco and his mother start losing control over the plot, while the characters inside the story gain it. And I will stop here because I do not want to spoil the rest of the plot but lets just say that the big challenge for the characters inside the story, Marco and his mother is to figure out what kind of bird is that and what is its relation to the tiny paper bicycle. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is the Visual and Artistic concept of the movie?</h2>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535147130/vgv1gwkslvuvoxeikhol.png"" src=""""/></h2>
<p>The action is none verbal, this is, only the Mother's and Marco's voice narrate the story. The acting characters have no voice.</p>
<p>Usually bedtime stories come in books for parents to read to their children. Books that are made out of paper. I remember, as a child, that my favorite were the ones that had 3D illustrations made out of origami, that would pop up right after we turned a page. Picking up this ideia, I decided to create an universe parallel to our reality where everything made by human hand, like clothes, furniture or bicycles, is made out of paper, completely or partially. More natural things like trees, the soil, streets or flowers resemble from our world, without any artistic man made intervention. </p>
<p>Three movies that inspired ""Matilde and the invisible bird"" are:</p>
<p>""Kubo and the two strings"" - Travis Knight (the type of narration, the use of origami technic)</p>
<p>""The illusionist"" - Sylvain Chomet (a movie non verbal, the relationships)</p>
<p>""Surprise"" - Paulo Patrício (the type of narration)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Where will the funds go?</h2>
<p>When you finish cinema university you actually have a lot of fresh contacts of people who might be interested to work with you. Usually they help you, but then we end up with a bad habit, which is, doing movies by favors and always finding excuses for not paying the crew: ""Well ... I am only 22 years old, I have no money, so please I just ask for a little of your time"",  ""You will not be paid, but at least you will be able to show your artistic vision"", or, "" I have a small budget but it is only for costumes, transportation and food"".</p>
<p>Yes, some of these things might be true, and it's very difficult to be able to pay your crew members when you only are a recent graduated cinema student, but that doesn't mean that you cannot find a way, even if it only is symbolic, to pay them at least something for their precious help.</p>
<p>So, my main goal with this campaign is to get funds to be able to pay my team and break the circle of working for free in your first years as an artist.</p>
<p>Here is a simple graphic of how I would divided the funds:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tay Montgomery, creator of The Adventure of Teddy Love. At the age of 8, I wrote my first screenplay and never looked back. My influences are Chris Rock,  F Gary Gray &amp; Robert Townsend. Since 2015 my production company Nightowl TV strictly created content for producers and production companies for purchase. As of January 2018, Heather Nicholas and I kept The Adventures of Teddy Love for ourselves to develop. It took my co-writer, Heather Nicholas and I almost a year just to revise it. </p>
<p>As of today, we have the script completed, attached an executive producer and director. Our partner Prodigium Pictures, a social impact production company based out of Los Angeles, is ready to go into production. However, Nashville is know for it's music, not film. Filmmakers in this area have to rely on personal funding for projects (Hey Dad!) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise at least 30k to finish production of The Adventures of Teddy Love.                          As you can see we have big plans for the potential television series!</p>
<p>Your donations will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal Fees</li>
<li>Cast / Crew</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Equipment</li>
<li>Food &amp; Supplies</li>
<li>Set &amp; Wardrobe</li>
</ul>
<p>In return, our sponsors have helped us create AMAZING rewards for those who choose to donate. From a social media shoutout to becoming a producer on the film, you will benefit greatly when you join the Teddy Love family!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We support social impact projects! We'd love to include you! Hollywood is not only lacking in original content but it aso suffers from lack of diversity. The passion for film doesn't only reside in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta, but nationally.  </p>
<p>Help us create jobs for minority cast, crew and even local business that normally wouldn't have an oppurtunity like this in the south. Help us contribute to television  in a positive way while bringing another hit series to Nashville. </p>

<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. We plan to distribute this nationally. If you'd like to sponsor your services, email us. If you can't donate or sponsor, spread the word! Anything and everything helps! </p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Tay Montgomery, creator of The Adventure of Teddy Love. At the age of 8, I wrote my first screenplay and never looked back. My influences are Chris Rock,  F Gary Gray & Robert Townsend. Since 2015 my production company Nightowl TV strictly created content for producers and production companies for purchase. As of January 2018, Heather Nicholas and I kept The Adventures of Teddy Love for ourselves to develop. It took my co-writer, Heather Nicholas and I almost a year just to revise it. 
As of today, we have the script completed, attached an executive producer and director. Our partner Prodigium Pictures, a social impact production company based out of Los Angeles, is ready to go into production. However, Nashville is know for it's music, not film. Filmmakers in this area have to rely on personal funding for projects (Hey Dad!) 

What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise at least 30k to finish production of The Adventures of Teddy Love.                          As you can see we have big plans for the potential television series!
Your donations will go towards:

Legal Fees
Cast / Crew
Insurance
Equipment
Food & Supplies
Set & Wardrobe

In return, our sponsors have helped us create AMAZING rewards for those who choose to donate. From a social media shoutout to becoming a producer on the film, you will benefit greatly when you join the Teddy Love family!

The Impact
We support social impact projects! We'd love to include you! Hollywood is not only lacking in original content but it aso suffers from lack of diversity. The passion for film doesn't only reside in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta, but nationally.  
Help us create jobs for minority cast, crew and even local business that normally wouldn't have an oppurtunity like this in the south. Help us contribute to television  in a positive way while bringing another hit series to Nashville. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. We plan to distribute this nationally. If you'd like to sponsor your services, email us. If you can't donate or sponsor, spread the word! Anything and everything helps!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This is a short celebrating diversity, where the notion of identity is questioned in every frame.

<p>Our previous film 'The Liar' has been selected and won in more than 15 international film festivals, including the Southern Shorts Awards (Best Film), Orlando Film Festival, Fargo Film Festival, and Los Angeles Independent Film Awards. If it managed to be successfull is thanks to your support.</p>
<p>But while 'The Liar' is a more commercial production, 'La Petite Mort' is addressing a more selected, mature audience. </p>
<p>That is why your contribution can really make a difference: with the appropriate production value, festivals will be fighting for it!</p>

That is why your contribution can really make a difference: with the appropriate production value, festivals will be fighting for it!

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to the Indiegogo campaign for <i>I Believe</i>! This short film was written by Alyson Seeger who is also directing and producing. This is Aly's first directing project since graduating Columbia College Chicago in 2010. She has produced other shorts since graduation, including ""Grim,"" and ""Elf Employment"".</p>
<p>Aly feels the film industry needs a stronger female presence, and this is her way of contributing to that. Additionally, she is a member of the LGBT community and would like her film to represent that community in a positive way.</p>
<p>Aly has been working on this project for four years, and is finally ready to finish it. As you probably know, it isn't easy nor cheap to make a film, so one of the main struggles for this project has always been funding. If you contribute, you are making Aly's four-year dream come true!</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Aly was bored one day, yet feeling creative. She looked up some quotes to see if anything would inspire her. She found the Audrey Hepburn quote you see above, and this beautiful tale following two women through their ups and downs in life is what came out. This film is unique in that it is silent with the exception of a voiceover reading that quote.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this Indiegogo campaign is to raise enough funds to produce the film and send it on the film festival circuit.</p>
<p>Some examples of the things we are spending the money on:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are flying our incredible Director of Photography up from Phoenix, Arizona.</li>
<li>Hair and makeup to age the actors appropriately.</li>
<li>Purchasing beautiful wedding outfits for our two lovely brides.</li>
<li>Feeding our hungry and hard-working cast and crew.</li>
<li>The film festival submission fees that can add up quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we would like to pay our very deserving cast and crew.</p>
<p>To show appreciation for your donations, we have plenty of unique rewards available to those who contribute financially, including thank you postcards, the opportunity to be an extra in the film, and the opportunity to be listed as an executive producer on the film.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the major challenges in producing this film is going to be finding a hospital location for the elderly versions of our characters. Additionally, it is not going to be easy to find actors who look alike enough to age our characters from young teens to elderly women.</p>
<p>We have hired a very qualified makeup artist who we are confident will do the job just right when it comes to aging the women appropriately. We also have an experienced casting director who will find the right fit of actors. The hospital location will be a challenge, but we are looking into finding that location as we speak!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean they can't help at all! You are certainly welcome (and encouraged) to share this link with those you feel might be able to assist in getting this project made. We appreciate every share.</p>

I was then surprised to find out there was a school for deaf children in Gabon because I had never met, studied or worked with anyone who communicates with sign language there. We gave weekly filmmaking classes to the 6<sup>th</sup> graders for 2 months and came up all together with a story for a narrative short, in which some of the teens acted while others assisted in different capacities.</p><p><i>Tout a commencé en 2015 lorsque la cinéaste Nathalie Pontalier m'a invitée à écrire et à diriger le projet qu'elle réalisait en partenariat avec l'École Nationale pour Enfants Déficients Auditifs, qui serait soumis au festival de cinéma Sourd Métrage qui l'avait commandée. J'ai été surprise de découvrir qu'il y avait une école pour enfants sourds au Gabon parce que je n'avais jamais rencontré, étudié ou travaillé avec quelqu'un qui communique avec la langue des signes. Nous avons donné des cours de cinéma hebdomadaires aux élèves de 6e pendant deux mois et nous avons créé une histoire pour un court métrage, dans lequel certains des adolescents jouait alors que d'autres assistaient dans différentes capacités.</i></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523266899/dkbzdc9brtkxwtspzard.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>I was instantly fascinated by the feeling of peace and serenity that bathed the workroom whenever I entered it, the easiness with which we all communicated —with the help of translator Ben Diawara Nziengui because speech reading is not taught to deaf people in Gabon, how seamless the classes ran and how, after the ice broke, inspired and talented the kids were. It quickly became obvious that they were naturally highly skilled for any visual activity, like learning a text, acting, photographing, styling, storyboarding, etc.</p><p><i>J'ai été immédiatement fascinée par le sentiment de paix et de sérénité qui baignait notre salle de travail chaque fois que j'y entrait, la facilité avec laquelle nous communiquions tous - avec l'aide du traducteur Ben Diawara Nziengui parce que la reconnaissance n'est pas enseignée aux sourds au Gabon ; la facilite du déroulement de nos cours, et comment, après la glace soit rompue, inspiré et talentueux les enfants étaient.

We had sat countless times sharing experiences while developing the screenplay for the short Telesourd together, drawing into personal experiences for storylines. We had so many more stories to tell. Moreover, knowing they had very few career options because of the lack of advanced education for hearing impaired people in Gabon, I was excited to offer them the possibility to build capacity in a field they had come to embrace and love, and that they could monetize in the future.</p><p><i>Après le tournage, je savais que je voulais travailler plus avec les enfants et leurs mentors.

I was then surprised to find out there was a school for deaf children in Gabon because I had never met, studied or worked with anyone who communicates with sign language there. We gave weekly filmmaking classes to the 6th graders for 2 months and came up all together with a story for a narrative short, in which some of the teens acted while others assisted in different capacities.Tout a commencé en 2015 lorsque la cinéaste Nathalie Pontalier m'a invitée à écrire et à diriger le projet qu'elle réalisait en partenariat avec l'École Nationale pour Enfants Déficients Auditifs, qui serait soumis au festival de cinéma Sourd Métrage qui l'avait commandée. J'ai été surprise de découvrir qu'il y avait une école pour enfants sourds au Gabon parce que je n'avais jamais rencontré, étudié ou travaillé avec quelqu'un qui communique avec la langue des signes. Nous avons donné des cours de cinéma hebdomadaires aux élèves de 6e pendant deux mois et nous avons créé une histoire pour un court métrage, dans lequel certains des adolescents jouait alors que d'autres assistaient dans différentes capacités.  I was instantly fascinated by the feeling of peace and serenity that bathed the workroom whenever I entered it, the easiness with which we all communicated —with the help of translator Ben Diawara Nziengui because speech reading is not taught to deaf people in Gabon, how seamless the classes ran and how, after the ice broke, inspired and talented the kids were. It quickly became obvious that they were naturally highly skilled for any visual activity, like learning a text, acting, photographing, styling, storyboarding, etc.J'ai été immédiatement fascinée par le sentiment de paix et de sérénité qui baignait notre salle de travail chaque fois que j'y entrait, la facilité avec laquelle nous communiquions tous - avec l'aide du traducteur Ben Diawara Nziengui parce que la reconnaissance n'est pas enseignée aux sourds au Gabon ; la facilite du déroulement de nos cours, et comment, après la glace soit rompue, inspiré et talentueux les enfants étaient. Il est rapidement devenu évident qu'ils étaient naturellement hautement qualifiés pour toute activité visuelle, comme l'apprentissage d'un texte, le jeu d'acteur, la photographie, le stylisme, le storyboard, etc  After we wrapped the shoot, I knew I wanted to work more with the kids and their mentors. We had sat countless times sharing experiences while developing the screenplay for the short Telesourd together, drawing into personal experiences for storylines. We had so many more stories to tell. Moreover, knowing they had very few career options because of the lack of advanced education for hearing impaired people in Gabon, I was excited to offer them the possibility to build capacity in a field they had come to embrace and love, and that they could monetize in the future.Après le tournage, je savais que je voulais travailler plus avec les enfants et leurs mentors. Nous avions partagé d'innombrables expériences tout en développant ensemble le scénario du court Telesourd, en s’inspirant d’expériences personnelles pour les scénarios. Nous avions tellement d'autres histoires à raconter. De plus, sachant qu'ils avaient très peu de choix de carrière en raison du manque d'éducation avancée pour les malentendants au Gabon, j'étais enthousiaste de leur offrir la possibilité de renforcer leurs capacités dans un domaine qu'ils avaient appris à aimer et à aimer, et qu’ils pourraient monétiser dans le futur.  I wanted to focus on themes around self-accomplishment and solidarity, to distance myself from usual topics of self-deprecation or victimization. I also wanted to craft a narrative that was intimate, to show the audience Gabonese individuals dealing with conflict, love, jealousy, rejection, greed, ambition.So I centered the stories on each character’s personal experiences and the beauty that can come from their dire circumstances.Je voulais me concentrer sur des thèmes autour de l'auto-accomplissement et de la solidarité, pour m'éloigner des sujets habituels d'auto-dépréciation ou de victimisation. Je voulais aussi faire un récit intime, pour montrer au public gabonais des individus aux prises avec le conflit, l'amour, la jalousie, le rejet, la cupidité, l'ambition.Donc, j'ai centré les histoires sur les expériences personnelles de chaque personnage et la beauté qui peut venir de leurs circonstances désastreuses.  Training and sharing knowledge being the cornerstone, we crewed up students or young graduates for the assistant’s positions. The visual style I created with my Cinematographer Puntcho Bagnet and my Set Designer Malanda Loumouamou had to reflect the spirit of the project and channel the hope I wanted to infuse in it. I also wanted the story to be easily accessible to a broad and young audience, which meant fast-paced and catchy.La formation et le partage des connaissances étant la pierre angulaire, nous avons fait équipe avec des étudiants ou de jeunes diplômés pour les postes d'assistants. Le style visuel que j'ai créé avec mon directeur de la photographie Puntcho Bagnet et ma scénographe Malanda Loumouamou devait refléter l'esprit du projet et canaliser l'espoir que je souhaitais y insuffler. Je voulais aussi que l'histoire soit facilement accessible à un public large et jeune, ce qui signifiait un rythme rapide et accrocheur.  We spent 19 days shooting in the Libreville and somehow pulled off an amazing feat of Independent filmmaking. Now we want to invite you into the process to help us finish the film.Nous avons passé 19 jours à tourner à Libreville et avons réussi à faire un exploit incroyable de cinéma indépendant.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Rink Wester and the Rink Wester 726 Foundation Studios here!</h3>
<p>We’ve been waiting and yearning and pining to do this, and now the time has come. The novels have been a blockbuster success worldwide, our script is written and we’re getting all antsy in our pantsy to start shooting. There’s just one problem:</p>
<p>While the studio has given us tentative permission to start our film series journey, and agreed to distribute it (at least in the USA and Canada) and to foot 50% of the total filming and production cost, we need to fund the rest of the movie ourselves. (Bummer! I know!)</p>
<p>Enter: YOU!</p>
<p>So this is how it works: if we’re able to raise at least $2,000,000 in the next month, we’ll be able to get to work on a barebones version of ""Of The Dark and The Deep"" (the first film in the series) this summer. But $2,000,000 is the bare minimum we’ll need to get into production.</p>
<p>Rink Wester (Hi again...yeah...that's me!) is investing $750,000 of his own money (Whew! Lord have mercy!)  while The Studio has graciously agreed to invest $1 Million ('Dere is a Gawd Somewhere!) and the final $250,000, as they say, IS UP TO YOU! </p>
<p>We’ve got some big stuff in the script, and if we’re able to raise enough money, you’ll get to see all of it. The more we raise, the more amazing stuff we can put in the movie. More magyck, more epic god and wizard battles, sexy action, more famous actor cameos, more film shenanigans, and just...MORE!</p>
<p>And here’s the other thing: to give <strong>OF THE DARK AND THE DEEP</strong> a wider release – that is, to get it into a theater near YOU – we need to prove that there’s a real demand to see it, and not just a dozen stoned out Wiccans who keep asking for it over and over (I love you Wiccans! Truly I do!).</p>
<p>That means: the more people who contribute to help make the movie, the better our chances of getting a wide release, and coming to a theater where you can enjoy the magykal world of Hikorim and the gods of the Ogdoad living in Atlanta in their full, cinematic splendor.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. Tiffany Haddish...please call us girl!!!! We heard you love Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Magyck and there is always a role here for you boo!!!!!</strong></p>
</div><div><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523464114/nmni5cgdd2z6qtoiqxvg.png"" src=""""/></h3></div><div>
<p>Now can we talk about what you really want to know? We know that aside from a powerful action packed sci-fi/fantasy movie, you also want some cool perks. Well, our perks are so good they might change your social, emotional, sexual, religious and political views. (Yep! Just that good!)</p>
<p>If you help us get it made now, you shouldn’t have to pay again to see it later. Whatever you contribute now doesn’t just go into someone’s pocket as profit: it lets us make a better movie for you. Why wait and pay later with the rest of the crowd? Most of our perk packages let you see the  movie you helped produce when it comes out: get Fandango Movie Tickets ($35 package and above), DVDs and Blu-Rays ($150 package and above), and add the digital download as an add-on (just $30).</p>
<p>It’s your movie too, so you should be able to share the experience. You’re the reason we’ve knocked down walls and bent the knee any and everywhere we could trying to make this movie, and you’re the reason we’ll get to make it now, so we want you rookie gøds, wizards, witches, warlocks, elves, orcs, fairies (you know who you are girl!) sprites, demons, angels, atheist warlords, girl scouts and mailmen to be right in there with us. We’ve got big plans for behind-the-scenes access, and our perks include actual producer credits, movie equity, set visits, chances to be in the movie, tickets to an exclusive advance screening tour, or even to join us at one of the red carpet premieres and afterparties! We’ll show you how the Rink Wester 726 Studio makes a movie.  It might get weird. (But you'll love it! Admit it...you  like it a little weird, doncha'!)</p>
<p>We want to hang out with you folks.  We love getting to chill with you wherever you are in the world. So we’ve got some fun stuff planned for the next 6 months (But only if we reach our goal!)</p>
<p>Join us in a private luxury box to catch a baseball/football/basketball game, or meet up with us in Atlanta or DC to grab some chicken/waffles/beer/wine/corn liquor and pancakes or for the brave, come drink against us at our first ever Rink Wester Winefest Tournament. We’ll kick your ass, but we’ll respect you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>And for our top contributors, we’re willing to go that extra mile.</strong></p>
<p>Take over our set. Want to hang out behind the camera and help Rink Wester direct? We’ll let you call action. Prefer to pad out your IMDB page with an on-screen credit as one of our producers? Done. Prefer to be in front of the camera? We’ve got a speaking line with your name on it. (That’s right: we’re offering the chance to be in <strong>OF THE DARK AND THE DEEP</strong>!That’s how serious we are!!!)</p>
<p>We’ll come to you. That’s right. Kick back, relax, and forget about the hassles of travel: we’ll get on a plane and come to you.

Howdy Folks!
Rink Wester and the Rink Wester 726 Foundation Studios here!
We’ve been waiting and yearning and pining to do this, and now the time has come. The novels have been a blockbuster success worldwide, our script is written and we’re getting all antsy in our pantsy to start shooting. There’s just one problem:
While the studio has given us tentative permission to start our film series journey, and agreed to distribute it (at least in the USA and Canada) and to foot 50% of the total filming and production cost, we need to fund the rest of the movie ourselves. (Bummer! I know!)
Enter: YOU!
So this is how it works: if we’re able to raise at least $2,000,000 in the next month, we’ll be able to get to work on a barebones version of ""Of The Dark and The Deep"" (the first film in the series) this summer. But $2,000,000 is the bare minimum we’ll need to get into production.
Rink Wester (Hi again...yeah...that's me!) is investing $750,000 of his own money (Whew! Lord have mercy!)  while The Studio has graciously agreed to invest $1 Million ('Dere is a Gawd Somewhere!) and the final $250,000, as they say, IS UP TO YOU! 
We’ve got some big stuff in the script, and if we’re able to raise enough money, you’ll get to see all of it. The more we raise, the more amazing stuff we can put in the movie. More magyck, more epic god and wizard battles, sexy action, more famous actor cameos, more film shenanigans, and just...MORE!
And here’s the other thing: to give OF THE DARK AND THE DEEP a wider release – that is, to get it into a theater near YOU – we need to prove that there’s a real demand to see it, and not just a dozen stoned out Wiccans who keep asking for it over and over (I love you Wiccans! Truly I do!).
That means: the more people who contribute to help make the movie, the better our chances of getting a wide release, and coming to a theater where you can enjoy the magykal world of Hikorim and the gods of the Ogdoad living in Atlanta in their full, cinematic splendor.
P.S. Tiffany Haddish...please call us girl!!!! We heard you love Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Magyck and there is always a role here for you boo!!!!!

Now can we talk about what you really want to know? We know that aside from a powerful action packed sci-fi/fantasy movie, you also want some cool perks. Well, our perks are so good they might change your social, emotional, sexual, religious and political views. (Yep! Just that good!)
If you help us get it made now, you shouldn’t have to pay again to see it later. Whatever you contribute now doesn’t just go into someone’s pocket as profit: it lets us make a better movie for you. Why wait and pay later with the rest of the crowd? Most of our perk packages let you see the  movie you helped produce when it comes out: get Fandango Movie Tickets ($35 package and above), DVDs and Blu-Rays ($150 package and above), and add the digital download as an add-on (just $30).
It’s your movie too, so you should be able to share the experience. You’re the reason we’ve knocked down walls and bent the knee any and everywhere we could trying to make this movie, and you’re the reason we’ll get to make it now, so we want you rookie gøds, wizards, witches, warlocks, elves, orcs, fairies (you know who you are girl!) sprites, demons, angels, atheist warlords, girl scouts and mailmen to be right in there with us. We’ve got big plans for behind-the-scenes access, and our perks include actual producer credits, movie equity, set visits, chances to be in the movie, tickets to an exclusive advance screening tour, or even to join us at one of the red carpet premieres and afterparties! We’ll show you how the Rink Wester 726 Studio makes a movie.  It might get weird. (But you'll love it! Admit it...you  like it a little weird, doncha'!)
We want to hang out with you folks.  We love getting to chill with you wherever you are in the world. So we’ve got some fun stuff planned for the next 6 months (But only if we reach our goal!)
Join us in a private luxury box to catch a baseball/football/basketball game, or meet up with us in Atlanta or DC to grab some chicken/waffles/beer/wine/corn liquor and pancakes or for the brave, come drink against us at our first ever Rink Wester Winefest Tournament. We’ll kick your ass, but we’ll respect you in the morning.
And for our top contributors, we’re willing to go that extra mile.
Take over our set. Want to hang out behind the camera and help Rink Wester direct? We’ll let you call action. Prefer to pad out your IMDB page with an on-screen credit as one of our producers? Done. Prefer to be in front of the camera? We’ve got a speaking line with your name on it. (That’s right: we’re offering the chance to be in OF THE DARK AND THE DEEP!That’s how serious we are!!!)
We’ll come to you. That’s right. Kick back, relax, and forget about the hassles of travel: we’ll get on a plane and come to you. Have us organize a private reading/concert/winetasting  show for you and your 25 closest friends. Or invite us to your wedding, and I/We will join you at the altar as your groomsmen (or bridesmaids, ladies, if you prefer).
For you hardcore magyck enthusiasts receive a real custom handmade Michael Amini Victoria Palace platinum and gold plated Wand and magyckal Elven Staff hewn from pure blessed African Sandalwood (This wood is $20,000 a kilo y'all! That's how serious we take our love of magyckal lore!)
Check out all of the perk packages you can grab to the right and lower on the page, and keep checking back until the campaign ends. We’ll add at least a few more surprise perks as we think of them, and if you’ve got requests, we might even add a few of those too, so let us know in the comments.

<p>AWOL follows the lives of Emma and Haydn, who are in crippling financial trouble. Like most Londoners, Emma works a menial job that she hates to make ends meet, while Haydn is lackadaisical towards finding employment. After Emma hitting breaking point, Haydn hatches a plan to fraudulently claim against his life insurance policy through faking his death. To do this successfully, they have to be cunning and make sure that they aren't caught in the process of committing fraud. Alongside this, they're having problems with their relationship. Will they make it through this rough patch together or will they get caught in the process?</p>

<p>Although the components behind making a film are expensive, the team has worked extensively to come up with innovative ways to make this film financially achievable. The estimated cost of this film is over £90,000! With access to equipment and our team being exceptional knowledgeable in their craft, we’re able to make huge savings on most of the film. However, some things, like locations and transport, still cost money.

<p><i>Carry Tiger to Mountain</i> is a dramatic short film about a compassionate Chinese caregiver who uses herbal medicine to treat a terminally ill patient, putting him at odds with the dying man's controlling daughter, who only believes in Western medicine.</p>
<p>Inspired by true events, <i>Carry Tiger to Mountain</i> deals with aging, a patient's right to choose, and the differences that can arise within a family regarding how one deals with a terminal illness; subjects that no doubt have affected, or will affect, everyone at some time in their lives.</p>
<p>By bringing this story out in the open, we hope to ignite a constructive and healthy dialogue about the lives and well-being of end-of-life caregivers and the people they care for. We hope our film will be used as a tool to promote healing among families and caregivers experiencing the illness of a loved one and the end of life decisions that accompany them.</p>
<p>We are seeking funding and support from individuals/organizations such as yourself to bring this important and universal story to life, which we intend to shoot in July. <font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We need $10,000 in additional funding for production and post-production costs </span>and<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>any amount - from $25 to $3000 - would be greatly appreciated.</font></p>
<p><font>Please check out our great perks, from Mandarin lessons and script coverage to attending the premiere in Los Angeles.</font></p>
<p>We hope you will join us in bringing this universal story to life by contributing today to our IndieGoGo campaign.</p>
<p>Gratefully yours,</p>
<p>Rajiv, Jesse and Rob</p>
<p>P.S. Even you can't contribute funds, please help us out by using the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Thanks!</p>

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","Carry Tiger to Mountain is a dramatic short film about a compassionate Chinese caregiver who uses herbal medicine to treat a terminally ill patient, putting him at odds with the dying man's controlling daughter, who only believes in Western medicine.
Inspired by true events, Carry Tiger to Mountain deals with aging, a patient's right to choose, and the differences that can arise within a family regarding how one deals with a terminal illness; subjects that no doubt have affected, or will affect, everyone at some time in their lives.
By bringing this story out in the open, we hope to ignite a constructive and healthy dialogue about the lives and well-being of end-of-life caregivers and the people they care for. We hope our film will be used as a tool to promote healing among families and caregivers experiencing the illness of a loved one and the end of life decisions that accompany them.
We are seeking funding and support from individuals/organizations such as yourself to bring this important and universal story to life, which we intend to shoot in July. We need $10,000 in additional funding for production and post-production costs and any amount - from $25 to $3000 - would be greatly appreciated.
Please check out our great perks, from Mandarin lessons and script coverage to attending the premiere in Los Angeles.
We hope you will join us in bringing this universal story to life by contributing today to our IndieGoGo campaign.
Gratefully yours,
Rajiv, Jesse and Rob
P.S. Even you can't contribute funds, please help us out by using the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Thanks!

Making films is an inherently risky business, and we have taken great care in considering all possible obstacles in our production. With a creatively dedicated crew, consistent supervision by industry professionals, and an initial monetary contribution by our executive team, we have created a strong base to help kick this project off in October. 
 

 
Perks 
Every contribution over $10 grants you an automatic Thank You in the credits of the film. We recognize everyone who supports our project as an integral part of our film making process. All of our perks intend to offer you a creative reward including prints and merch with original artwork by Rayah Gugliotta of Paperback Studio.
While we are grateful for all financial contributions to this project, we understand that not everyone is in the position to donate. We also see the incredible value in social media posts and would love for your to share our Indiegogo page.

<p>My name is Lucah Rosenberg Lee and about five years ago I partnered with J. Mitchel Reed to embark on creating a short documentary that changed our lives and countless others.</p>
<p>""Passing"" for me, was my public coming out. In 2014, I was living and working as a trans man at a job where no one knew anything about my past. There were many times when a co-worker might make a derogatory comment about a trans person, not knowing they had been friends with someone trans for years. It was those types of experiences that made me want to open up about my gender transition.</p>
<p>At the time, my biggest fear was people knowing I was transgender. I thought if I came out, I'd never get a job again or I'd be discriminated against indefinitely. But I truly felt that this experience of going from a woman of colour to a man of colour, was a story deserving of being told, not only for myself but for the countless others who were and are going through the same thing.</p>
<p>Getting the subjects for ""Passing"" was a challenge because at the time, it was hard to find people willing to discuss their transition openly, but we found two incredible souls to participate, one in Texas and one in New York City. </p>
<p>Amazingly, the day we started to shoot the film, Laverne Cox was on the cover of Time Magazine with the headline, ""The Transgender Tipping Point:"" it was then I knew we were moving in the right direction. Not only with this project, but within our entire culture.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524929808/kjczydiekicxddotxuzr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since the making of “Passing”, I’ve been touring the film and speaking to thousands of middle and high school kids discussing my almost 10-year experience with gender transition. Seeing the impact that our documentary short continues to have on all types of audiences and seeing the conversations it's still fostering and the questions that continue to be raised about gender, race, class and most recently, trans rights has propelled us to move to the next phase of this project -- a feature documentary.</p>
<p>It has been a truly incredible experience for us to see the ways lives have been touched by our content. One important element has been frequently asked questions about the cultural representation of trans people over the years. This has affected me on many levels as I reflect on what its been like growing up without any trans representation in the media. Not seeing trans people depicted in a positive light or for that matter, present at all, was in retrospect, quite impactful. Many people take for granted the positive impact of seeing people ""like you"" reflected in art and culture and its role in shaping feelings of acceptance as a competent, happy and valuable person. The truth is, I didn't even know what transgender was until I graduated high school.</p>
<p>And so we hope through creating a longer feature film, we can provide in a very open, accessible and public way, a vehicle to present meaningful stories that will engage a younger generation to feel safe discussing the multiple identities that might arise in their lives, and to understand that they can also change throughout time. At base, our new film follows our previous goals of representation and education in helping people form questions and figure out answers.</p>
<p>We made ""Passing"" in a time of cultural upturn and in many ways, we were apart of what turned out to be the <u>beginning</u> of a new level of understanding for ways we can move forward together. </p>

<p>""Passing"" the short was about going into the field, interviewing, and evaluating the trans experience in 2014.</p>
<p>""Passing: The Feature"", will act to document what has changed, where we are in this moment when it comes to gender expression, identity, and politics of race, age and other constructions of difference. We ask: what sorts of challenges may lie ahead. Just as we did four years ago, we will follow the voices of our interviewees and the stories we uncover will shape our final film.</p>
<p>In the last few years, we have seen some incredible strides and some major setbacks. What does it mean to be transgender in 2018? How are trans folks navigating our current gender climate? Is the goal of passing in society as their chosen gender still something trans people seek or is visibility in our bodies actually becoming more important?</p>
<p>How can hearing the experiences of those who have lived as both male and female, deepen our societal understanding of how masculinity and feminity live inside all of us? </p>

<h3>What We Want To Do</h3>
<p>We are hoping with this campaign to raise enough money to support the three major stages of making a<i> </i><strong>feature </strong>documentary film. </p>
<p>Making a feature film is a significant undertaking and with a documentary, there are often unexpected turns within each stage as the piece slowly comes together. This entire process will take around two years to fully complete and we aim to screen in 2020. The final product will be used in film festivals, universities and public school curriculums (just as ""Passing"" has been and continues to be) in an effort to educate varying communities for years to come.</p>
<p>Your investment in this piece goes further than many fictional narratives. Not only are we creating something that will be able to touch thousands of people and get them involved in important discussions, it will act to archive this extremely pivotal period we currently living in. </p>
<p><u>Pre-Production</u></p>
<p>When we made our short film, ""Passing,"" it was extremely difficult to find our subjects. We spoke to dozens of people and conducted pre-interviews and meetings over the course of about 6 months before getting Sasha and Victor to agree to be interviewed and filmed. Even though it might be a bit easier this time around (there are already multiple people we wanted in the first film but weren't able to fit who we'll be contacting) it will still take a considerable amount of time and effort. </p>
<p><i>What we'll be paying for:</i></p>
<p>- Research</p>
<p>- Conducting pre-interviews</p>
<p>- Hiring our crew</p>
<p>- Production management</p>
<p>- Travel expenses</p>
<p><u>Production (filming, interviewing, traveling) </u></p>
<p>The length of this period of the project will not be known until the first step is completed. </p>
<p><i>What we'll be paying for:</i></p>
<p>- Camera package </p>
<p>- Audio recordist</p>
<p>- Portable hard drives</p>
<p>- Room and board</p>
<p><u>Post-Production  (editing, colour and scoring) </u></p>
<p>This process will last three to nine months. Sorting through every scrap and morsel of film captured leads to the molding of our story. The colour grading makes it watchable and the score holds it all together.</p>
<p><i>What we'll be paying for:</i></p>
<p>- Editing suite</p>
<p>- Colour grading at a Toronto post-production house like Alter Ego</p>
<p>- Sound mixing</p>
<p>- Musical Scoring</p>
<p>- RAID Harddrives for double back ups and the protection of where all the money goes: the footage.</p>

<p><strong>I wrote this thing…</strong></p>
<p>I wrote, am executive producing and acting in a short film titled I’m just here. It is a project that is very close to my heart for many reasons. My step sister recently came out to me as transgender and is currently transitioning and since then, something struck me as concerning. I realized that while there has been a push for more LGBTQIA characters in film and television, there are very rarely trans characters and the few times that there are, they are almost always stories of extreme tragedy. While I think it's important to honor the darkness that so many trans people have experienced, I also think it's important to show people stories of hope and inspiration. I hate the idea that on the rare occasion there is a trans character that my sister connects with, she is consistently shown a story almost exclusively of sadness. So I wrote a script. It respectfully acknowledges the struggles of a character who is trans but in the end is a story of encouragement and light. </p>
<p>Another topic this story addresses is suicide prevention and mental health. The rate of suicide within the queer community is heartbreaking and within the trans community is even worse. A horrifying 41% of people who are trans have attempted suicide and we want to change that. The story of I’m just here tackles this topic head-on and sheds a light on it where many fear to go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Some cool things about I’m just here</strong></p>
<p>One thing that makes this project special is the talent that has been drawn to it. We have cast a top actor who has instrumental in LGBTQIA television history. Another thing that sets this project apart is that we have cast an actor who is actually transgender to play the role of the transgender character - an opportunity that is rarely taken in Hollywood and has received much criticism lately. We felt it was very important not to make that mistake and cast authentically. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another thing that makes us unique is that we are an almost entirely female crew - something that very rarely ever happens. It was important to all of us to give women opportunities to be involved because, sadly, they aren’t given as many as their male counterparts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#goals</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to make this short and get it into as many festivals as possible and spread awareness and education. We as filmmakers believe that our story has the ability to connect with a very diverse audience and has the potential to save lives. </p>

</div></div>","I wrote this thing…
I wrote, am executive producing and acting in a short film titled I’m just here. It is a project that is very close to my heart for many reasons. My step sister recently came out to me as transgender and is currently transitioning and since then, something struck me as concerning. I realized that while there has been a push for more LGBTQIA characters in film and television, there are very rarely trans characters and the few times that there are, they are almost always stories of extreme tragedy. While I think it's important to honor the darkness that so many trans people have experienced, I also think it's important to show people stories of hope and inspiration. I hate the idea that on the rare occasion there is a trans character that my sister connects with, she is consistently shown a story almost exclusively of sadness. So I wrote a script. It respectfully acknowledges the struggles of a character who is trans but in the end is a story of encouragement and light. 
Another topic this story addresses is suicide prevention and mental health. The rate of suicide within the queer community is heartbreaking and within the trans community is even worse. A horrifying 41% of people who are trans have attempted suicide and we want to change that. The story of I’m just here tackles this topic head-on and sheds a light on it where many fear to go.
 
Some cool things about I’m just here
One thing that makes this project special is the talent that has been drawn to it. We have cast a top actor who has instrumental in LGBTQIA television history. Another thing that sets this project apart is that we have cast an actor who is actually transgender to play the role of the transgender character - an opportunity that is rarely taken in Hollywood and has received much criticism lately. We felt it was very important not to make that mistake and cast authentically. 
 
Another thing that makes us unique is that we are an almost entirely female crew - something that very rarely ever happens. It was important to all of us to give women opportunities to be involved because, sadly, they aren’t given as many as their male counterparts. 
 
#goals
Our goal is to make this short and get it into as many festivals as possible and spread awareness and education. We as filmmakers believe that our story has the ability to connect with a very diverse audience and has the potential to save lives.

Eravamo occupati a registrare l’opera di Händel “Rinaldo” per Arthaus-DVD, eseguita dalla Lautten Company Berlin e con le marionette della Compagnia Carlo Colla &amp;amp; figli di Milano. Ho capito subito che persone in tutto il mondo devono innamorarsi del mondo magico creato e trasmesso dai marionettisti quando assistono ad uno spettacolo dei Colla. Loro riescono ad entusiasmare il pubblico con le loro marionette di legno di un’altezza di appena un metro e trasportarlo in un mondo di favole. Alla conclusione di una serata al teatro con i Colla bisogna stropicciarsi gli occhi come se ci si svegliasse da un sogno bellissimo.</p><p>Chi ha avuto a che fare con i Colla può, raccontandone la storia, contribuire a fare crescere la fama misteriosa del gruppo, con il loro atelier ed il loro magazzino in un cortile di una chiesa che si trova in un paesino alle porte di Milano, dove conservano migliaia e migliaia di accessori di scena, le quinte, marionette, parrucche e costumi. Con alle spalle una storia di 200 anni, che ne ha fatto un monumento nazionale, perché la loro arte era talmente apprezzata da eseguire persino opere e balletti del Teatro della Scala, e che famosi e conosciuti artisti di teatro parlano con entusiasmo della collaborazione con i Colla….</p><p>Un giorno decisi di andare a Milano di persona e ho scoperto che tutte queste storie sono vere. Ho avuto modo di passare una bellissima giornata in un luogo magico, in un regno di innumerevoli marionette, un luogo pieno di storia. I membri del gruppo erano impegnati a fare lavori da falegname, a dipingere, ad acconciare, a cucire, a riparare. Si percepiva un’area di concentrazione, avvolta dal suono di una vecchia radio che suonava tipiche melodie italiane intonate da degli altoparlanti.</p><p>Più sentivo il fascino che trasmettevano i Colla su di me, più cresceva il mio desiderio di girare un documentario su questo gruppo teatrale. Un film dedicato totalmente al loro soggetto, che è lontano dalle preoccupazioni delle redazioni TV a riguardo degli indici di ascolto, e lontano dai calcoli di redditività dalle case di produzione. Un film finanziato tramite ""crowdfunding"", da persone come me, interessate alla storia e all’arte della Carlo Colla &amp; figli.</p><p>I Colla sono un monumento vivo e presente ad un mestiere che si afferma nell’ambito analogico dell’arte teatrale, che cattura il momento dello spettacolo teatrale e che va contro un mondo virtuale e digitale.</p><p>Con questo film voglio prendervi per mano e guardare dietro le quinte dei Colla, guardare la loro vita, la loro storia, il loro mestiere e naturalmente voglio guardare la loro arte, comprendere la loro passione per il teatro delle marionette.

<p><i>Thanks for taking time to visit my campaign to make my documentary BackBurner Dreams a reality and bring it to the public.</i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Director's Statement </h3>
<p>For years, every night, before I went to sleep, I would pray to God that my mother wouldn’t die. Jews don’t kneel when we pray, or at least I was never taught to, so in the dark I would lie on my back and look at the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling and mutter a hymn memorized rote from years of Hebrew School on early Sunday mornings. She was always in constant peril, always at the mercy of some imaginary car accident or mass shooting or heart attack.</p> <p>The film is an unapologetic flourish of pageantry, but it is also a repository of my anxieties -- the fear of my losing my mother, the fear of the modern world with its thousand opportunities for oblivion at every turn -- and my desire to find relief in all the fantasy of art and song and poetry. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519610636/yfhio4agx1ojxnoeqpqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Uninvited</i> is a short horror mystery film centered around four college girls who are visited by an unexpected guest. The girls learn that they can only see this guest one at a time, through a phone screen. Without taking a group selfie they may have never been able to realize they were not alone. </p>
<p><i>Uninvited</i> is our first funded film, and we want to kick it off with a bang! With your help this can be possible. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In total, for this film to become a reality we need $1,072. Any contribution helps, and we really appreciate your help. </p>
<p>We have fun perks that range from a thank you letter with a selfie of the cast and crew inside, to a digital copy of the film! ​We cannot wait to share this experience with you!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>when I say we can't do this without your help I really mean it.  </p>
<p>This short film is going to keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. I want this film to be different from anything I have made before. I know this film will soar, and with the carefully handpicked cast and crew this film will prove successful. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Shooting a horror mystery film is something I have never done before however I am always ready to learn and challenge myself. I carefully chose my cast and crew and strongly believe that we will be successful. This is also the first time I have this large of a budget. Now, in the grand scheme of things, $1072 is not large in the film world, but for me, it's new, and new is hard (but not impossible!).

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>This Little Light of Mine is a period drama that takes place during the American revolution with a little bit of fantasy mixed in.</p>
<p>During the American Revolution when colonial women were told they had no power, one girl finds her inner light to fight her way out of the dark.</p>
<p>This film is about Chelsea, a shy and shelter girl is seeking to be heard by those around her; especially when she discovers her family’s neighbor, Matthew secretly copying her father’s letter that tells the location of supplies for the Patriots. By nurturing the spirit in herself and others, Chelsea discovers she has power over fire and uses it to fight her way out of the dark and finally be heard.</p>
<p>We have an amazing cast and crew, including Chase Rubin as Director of Photography. LaTasha Bundy is composing the music score for the film. This short film is the graduate film school project of Laura Duval, who is working on her MFA in Film at the University of New Orleans. She has been working on commercials and short films since 2009 and has had a number of successful projects that have gone on to festivals, including “Courage Under Fire,” a short film about the Vietnam war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will help make this film possible! Even a few dollars will help buy a prop for set or part of a costume or a meal for an actor. And we have a lot of props and costumes and meals to buy to make this film possible. We also need help to pay for the entry fee to submit to festivals.</p>
<p>Making a period piece is more difficult than others as it requires everything on set to be from that time period. The costume design will have to include 1770s style, Middle Class America Colonial clothing. The set design and props have to look as though they belong in the 1770s, so costumes and props are harder to find and make and more expensive. Several props and costumes have already been donated but we still have many more we need.</p>
<p>Visual and special effects are expensive and take skilled people to pull them off. Visual Effects Artist Todd Schmidt has volunteered his time to do the visual effects with fire. However, there are also a number of special effects that require props and safety equipment to pull them off. We need your help to make this project safe and visually exciting!</p>
<p>We have a Steadicam but we would like to rent a Ronin to film with, along with lights and other film equipment to make this film more visually engaging. There are some specialty lights we would like to get because we are filming with candlelight and want the scenes to be lit to look more natural and realistic of that time period. The more you donate, the better lights and equipment we can use to make this film more visually engaging.</p>
<p>Because we are filming with candlelight we also have a lot of candles to buy to help light the set, set the scene, and help tell the story. So every dollar you donate is two more candles we need for set!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Come join our team and help us make a movie!</p>
<p>We have T-shirts, buttons, stickers, and posters that were custom designed for this Indiegogo for “This Little Light of Mine” just for you to show the world you are letting your light shine!</p>
<p>If you want to see behind the scenes of “This Little Light of Mine,” we are making a special behind the scenes video just for our Indiegogo supporters who contribute $20. You will receive a special password that will allow you access to download this video at the end of post-production. This will include how we do some of the special effects and visual effects of the film!</p>
<p>We have an amazing cast, including Emily Blessey, Joey Alonzo, John Neisler, Olga Wilhelmine, Lisa Mackel Smith, Yvette Little, and John Raymond. You can receive a limited edition cast photo signed by some of the cast if you contribute $100 to help make this movie! But get them fast, we only have 20 available!</p>
<p>You can see your name on screen! We have a special thank you page in the credits for anyone who joins the team and contributes $200 or more.</p>
<p>Let the world know you are letting your light shine! We have a special limited edition package for those who want to contribute $500 to help make “This Little Light of Mine.” This is only for our Indiegogo supporters and only 20 will be made available. The package includes a custom design “This Little Light of Mine” T-shirt in your size and two custom designed “This Little Light of Mine” pins. You will also receive the “Behind the Scenes of This Little Light of Mine” video on DVD. You will also receive a cast photo signed by some of the cast.  It also includes “This Little light of Mine” custom stickers and a large movie poster that will only be available in this package!  Additionally, your name will be included on the special thank you page in the film’s credits.

<p>Ever wanted to be on set and see what filming a movie is like? If you contribute $2,000 you will be invited to be on set during filming. You will get to meet the cast and crew and experience what set is like. This also includes meals on set with the team! <i>(This does not include airfare or lodging)</i></p>
<p>If you want to feel even more a part of the team, you can have your very own Executive Produce credit if you contribute $5,000 or more. You will get to see your name at the beginning of the film on its own page as Executive Producer!</p>
<p>If we are able to raise more than our minimum goal, we will release a special video from the cast of “This Little Light of Mine” just for our Indiegogo Supporters!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This film is to inspire young girls to keep trying to have a voice in the world. Even though sometimes people will push you down and bad things happen, if you keep trying, eventually you will be heard and make a difference. This film is also meant to educate people about the American Revolution time period and also entertain at the same time. A lot of people have forgotten about the founding of the United States. It was an extremely inspiring time where farmers, merchants, and other every-day ordinary people, who had very little experience in war, banded together to fight a larger, better funded, more experience, army in order to have a say in government. And the colonialists won! This film shows young girls how even the smallest girl, facing extraordinary difficulties, can make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Many amazing people have volunteered their time and talent to help make this film so far. So even if we don’t make out goal, we will still find a way to make this film, but we will have to scale back and it will visually be a much better film if we can make our goal. Despite all of the creative and production challenges of this film, I believe with your help and all of the talented cast and crew who have volunteered their time on this project, we can create something that will catch people’s attention and inspire them.</p>

<p>For DENNIS BRECK every day is exactly the same. Stuck in a suburban rut of an unfulfilling job and a sexless marriage, <strong>Dennis lives his life unsatisfied and under stimulated.</strong> Constantly bombarded with endless amounts of porn sites, Instagram models, and hook up apps, Dennis feels that his chance to live the wild life he feels he deserves has passed him by.</p>
<p>When Dennis’ neighbor, the teenaged Adonis CONNER turns him on to an app that guarantees casual sex, his curiosity cannot be contained. Dennis downloads the app with the full intention of quickly deleting it, but his wife KATHERINE discovers it and they are for the first time forced to really evaluate their relationship. <strong>Are they boring? In a rut? Old?</strong></p>
<p>Together, Dennis and Katherine agree to enter a world where they will satisfy each other's wildest sexual fantasies. <strong>Costumes, places, positions, toys; seemingly nothing is off limits.</strong> Their relationship tightens as they push each other further and further, and everyone is getting exactly what they think they want. </p>
<p><strong>Sometimes, things get taken too far too fast.</strong> Lines are crossed, people are hurt, and things cannot be undone. Are Dennis and Katherine able to deal with their real lives, once their fantasy lives have passed the point of no return?</p>
<p><strong>Trunkfish is a sexy, sad, violent film</strong> that explores the scary reality of what happens when all your fantasies are brought to life.</p>

<p><strong>We've spent about $65k of our own money </strong>to get the project this far and, straight up, we're tapped out. We have come from all over for the love and respect for each other and our devotion to film. </p>
<p>There is so much goodwill and interested surrounding this project, but we simply can't self-fund the first step of getting this project out there and noticed. <strong>We need your help.</strong></p>
<p>Hollywood isn't a huge fan of getting behind original content, we need to make a big splash. Think of it this way: <strong>Hollywood always wants a happy ending</strong>, but what if not all endings are happy but real.</p>

Constantly bombarded with endless amounts of porn sites, Instagram models, and hook up apps, Dennis feels that his chance to live the wild life he feels he deserves has passed him by.
When Dennis’ neighbor, the teenaged Adonis CONNER turns him on to an app that guarantees casual sex, his curiosity cannot be contained. Dennis downloads the app with the full intention of quickly deleting it, but his wife KATHERINE discovers it and they are for the first time forced to really evaluate their relationship. Are they boring? In a rut? Old?
Together, Dennis and Katherine agree to enter a world where they will satisfy each other's wildest sexual fantasies. Costumes, places, positions, toys; seemingly nothing is off limits. Their relationship tightens as they push each other further and further, and everyone is getting exactly what they think they want. 
Sometimes, things get taken too far too fast. Lines are crossed, people are hurt, and things cannot be undone. Are Dennis and Katherine able to deal with their real lives, once their fantasy lives have passed the point of no return?
Trunkfish is a sexy, sad, violent film that explores the scary reality of what happens when all your fantasies are brought to life.
 

 

We've spent about $65k of our own money to get the project this far and, straight up, we're tapped out. We have come from all over for the love and respect for each other and our devotion to film. 
There is so much goodwill and interested surrounding this project, but we simply can't self-fund the first step of getting this project out there and noticed. We need your help.
Hollywood isn't a huge fan of getting behind original content, we need to make a big splash. Think of it this way: Hollywood always wants a happy ending, but what if not all endings are happy but real.

<p>Volly!! is a fan short film adaptation of ""Haikyu!!"" based upon specific chapters of the first tankōbon volume written by Haruichi Furudate. It tells the story of Sean Hindley, a student attending Gardner High School in order to join the volleyball team. His will to play will be tested by another Gardner volleyball player, Tobias Kirkman, who defeated him in a middle school game. Two people who hate each other must learn to play together, while overcoming their weaknesses and play to their strengths.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our names our Robert and Trevor Benoit. We're twin brothers from a small town in Massachusetts that want to share an amazing manga and create something truly unique at the same time.</li>
<li>This campaign is about bringing people together through passion and kindness. Haikyu!! is a manga that focuses on teamwork in the hardest of circumstances. This is, in a way, about the process of our journey as content creators. We have faced extraordinary odds in getting a project off the ground as writers with little resources. What makes this project important to us is bringing as many people together and making a wonderful thing that we all are a part of.</li>
<li>How this happens is through money we have made independently through our day jobs and what you as contributors will assist in. While what we need is money to make the short as stunning as possible, we also need to make a change in the world as well. How we do this is by looking at the endgame of the campaign. All of the money that we raise, not used for the budget will be donated to charity. Every single penny. Any money or revenue made after the release will go towards the next project we create, if we go beyond what we need for that project, those funds too, will go to charity. This to us has nothing to do with money. It has everything to do with sharing our passions with the world and to make a difference in the process. All of the proceeds that exceed what is needed will go straight to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital because every child deserves a chance at all of the amazing things the world has to offer and we would be humbled to play even the smallest part.</li>

<li>We need around eight thousand dollars in order to afford the various parts essential in bringing ""Volly!!"" to life. The budget will go to the many different aspects of production from equipment rental, cast and crew payment, costume design, location confirmation, soundtrack development, along with post-production editing and visual effects. Trevor and I will not be receiving any payment ourselves while working on the short. In fact, we will be paying for our time there and taking time off of our day jobs.

<li>If we don't reach our goal, we still are going to make the short. Everything we make will go towards the production and we will work our day jobs longer to make up the difference. At the end of the day, we want to project made and we guarantee that it will happen no matter what it takes!</li>

Whether it be awaiting reshoots or delaying the final product until ready. </li>
<li>If there were such a time where the project simply could not happen, we would make sure that anything that comes from you would go to charity.

This is as simple as it sounds. We need funding beyond the couple thousand we have raised on our own. In doing so, we will be able to deliver an amazing short film and you will be rewarded along with it.

We need around eight thousand dollars in order to afford the various parts essential in bringing ""Volly!!"" to life. The budget will go to the many different aspects of production from equipment rental, cast and crew payment, costume design, location confirmation, soundtrack development, along with post-production editing and visual effects. Trevor and I will not be receiving any payment ourselves while working on the short. In fact, we will be paying for our time there and taking time off of our day jobs. We are committed to utilizing all the funding as conservatively as possible.
The perks for you guys are something we are still working out. Potentially having hard-copy soundtracks for backers. Giving away costumes from the short to high backing contributors. Depends on how much we make!
If we don't reach our goal, we still are going to make the short. Everything we make will go towards the production and we will work our day jobs longer to make up the difference. At the end of the day, we want to project made and we guarantee that it will happen no matter what it takes!

<p>Hi, my name is Victor Hernandez. I am a video director born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Orange, California. Most of my career is centered around doing music videos for various artist spanning more than 8 years. Although I love doing music videos and various promotional videos, my heart and dream is to direct feature length films. Funny thing is that through doing music videos for fellow Orange County artists LGC, I met 4th Beats, and in turn, met Vel The Wonder. Vel and 4th together make up the duo called Melotonics. With their first self titled album release, which was highly praised and received, I had the honor to film two music videos for it. In a conversation with Vel and 4th, we talked about pushing the music videos from simple performance based videos, to more thought out storylines that weave into the video itself. After we did the video for ‘Stuck’, my mind dove into a creative thought overload that made the entire album into an actual short film. I love what Melotonics did on this album. Having themes of love, pain and heartbreak, all wrapped up in a 1950’s songbird feel, it had me come up with the character of Mela. A young girl trying to find love after a horrible break-up, which had a touch of me in it, for I had recently gone through a similar situation.</p> <p>I wrote the script which was just 10 pages long at first. After talking to a close mentor and friend of mine, Jared Lundy, he found an amazing writer, Jo Hannah Afton, who was willing to take up the script and expand it to 30 pages. Jo Hannah did a beautiful job at making this story into what it is today, but before we could get the script into pre-production, life got in the way. A lot of the planning for the short film actually took place 2 years ago, and like a fine wine with time, it got even better. Coming back to the project now, everything has organically fallen into place. We are proud to say that we have officially teamed up with CheckMate Films to move Melotonics from the pages, to the screen!</p> <p>The reasons for making this film is many: life long dreams to direct, for the fans of Melotonics, a drive to produce more creative content, to put out a heartfelt story; but most of all, to empower those with self love. The story of Melotonics, as stated above, follows a young woman who finds her fiancé cheating on her. In trying to forget the hurt, Mela goes off on an adventure to San Francisco, where she meets a man.  I hope that through this film, the audience can pull on the experiences that Mela goes through and the growth she gains as she finds love in herself, to implement those qualities in their own lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether it’s trying to find “the one”, understanding and empathy from parents, or simply feeling wanted, it’s a chase that unfortunately catch people feeling empty and/or still wanting more. I myself have experienced that going from relationship to relationship, and having a hard time seeing eye to eye because I had no understanding of where I stood myself as an individual. One must feel confident, and love themselves for who they are. I strongly believe that that’s something society lacks now and days. With people searching for the “LIKES” and “FOLLOWS”, many gauge their happiness on social media status, but what happens when all those things are done and gone? If you love yourself already and have a clear understanding of who you are, when all those temporary materialistic things have withered away, you still have that love and comfort that is inside you. I know that might sound cheesy or cliche´, but take it for me, it’s true. It comes from being real and honest with yourself, so that you may be truly honest and comfortable with others. It’s ok to feel angry, upset, scared or worried; but don’t let those emotions define you. I had a very close cousin of mine who took his own life because he could not cope with the pain that the world put on him. To this day it is hard to breath when I talk about him, remembering that no matter how much love my family and I gave to him, it wasn’t enough to stop him from taking committing suicide.</p> <p>I am so grateful that through the help of many friends and colleagues, this film is where it’s at. And even so, we cannot do it without your help! With your donations we can raise the budget necessary to push this script into production, and onward to completion. We have personal incentives for all those who participate in donating to the Melotonics Short Film, one of them being exclusive Behind The Scenes footage of the production process.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><i>""He will live a long lasting happy life, until he gets to know himself"". </i>Tiresias</p>
<p>The ancient Greek myth manifests as a derelict sacred place where the cursed by gods nymph Echo lives. Narcissus has never seen her/himself before according to Tiresias prophecy and Echo is able only to repeat what s/he hears. The game of seduction starts, Echo initially resists but they both are craving each other. Echo surrenders to Narcissus but when than happens Narcissus sees her/himself for the very first time through Echo. Her/his reflection makes her/him to eventually surrender to an im-possible self-love. Yellow and white, Echo’s tears go back to earth and Narcissus prefers to transform into the flower, the new Narcissus. Echo’s body shrivels and loses its moisture from the tears s/he is offering to earth so Narcissus can be reborn. Echo is turning into stone and s/he keeps holding the flower. The one s/he couldn’t before.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why to support us</strong></h3>
<p>The 21st century has been characterised as the <strong>century of narcissistic epidemic</strong>. The number of people who suffer from narcissistic personality disorder is being increased, therefore the number of the narcissistic abuse victims.</p>
<p>Echo of Narcissus is a short experimental art house film in an attempt to revisit an influential myth and give a new, different interpretation, avoiding gender and old fashioned stereotypes. Narcissism is beyond the gender or sexual identity, the race and the ethnicity. It’s about the lack of mirroring, the trauma and the personality’s development. The film is a contemporary approach of the myth in an abstract, ritualistic context and emphasises in the more profound and complex issue of transformation and rebirth for both of the characters. Narcissus and Echo seek their own catharsis and resolution but the way they are doing it, is different. </p>
<p>Combining Jungian theories, cinematic techniques, performance art, dance, visuals and music, we do not intend to judge or take the side of the victim or the perpetrator. We are aiming to explore through art how narcissistic behaviour works and hopefully give voice to every Echo.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Looking at the famous painting of Salvador Dali “The metamorphosis of Narcissus” I started asking myself how the artist approached one of the most influential myths in the history of humanity. Observing the colours and lighting, I noticed that the part after the metamorphosis looks brighter, more vivid whereas the part before, has darker shades. In addition to that and going back to the myth, I was wondering why Narcissus is transformed into a flower and not into something else. A flower means the beginning of spring, re-birth and in our days, Narcissus is offered in important occasions as a symbol of good fortune and new beginnings. That’s when I started thinking differently about the myth and its influence in our daily lives. What if the meaning is slightly different than the one we know for thousands of years? What if the roles of victim and perpetrator are not as obvious and concrete as we think they are? Why Narcissus initially seduces Echo and in the end why does he deny her love and prefers to fall for a reflection? Is Echo obsessed with her own sound reflection? Why does she keep being in pain for Narcissus, someone who hurt her feelings without mercy?</p>
<p>I am not in a position to give answers, but through this film I am trying to understand more about a phenomenon, which is “epidemic” and it affects the lives of many people like me, like you.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Katerina Konstantopoulou</strong>, <i>Director/Writer/Producer</i></p>
<p>Katerina was born in 1989 in Athens. After her BA in Film and TV studies, she moved to London and she is currently a postgraduate student at Goldsmiths University in the Producing pathway. Since, she started her studies, she has written, directed and produced two awarded short films, ""Vault of Ideas"", a story about an eerie stranger who wants an idea for an irrational death and ""Pessoa-s"", a film dedicated to the loving memory of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. She has also worked as assistant director at the theatre, video editor and photographer. Her problem is that she is stupidly romantic and suffers from need for escapism, so that's why she wants to make films which don't really depict the reality. </p>
<p><strong>EMPUSAE (Nicolas Van Meirhaeghe), </strong><i>Musician</i></p>
<p>With the complexity of the music, it may surprise you to find that Empusae is actually a project created by a single man, Nicolas Van Meirhaeghe aka Sal-Ocin. Empusae exercises a surreal science of structure that throbs and pulsates in an almost obsessive manner. The music is almost suggestive of a mechanical assembly line in its clock work clunks and clangs. It builds into a tense, yet haunting soundscape and rivets itself into the memory and refuses to be forgotten. It is serious music who's architecture has formed for itself a solid foundation, rather than sounding as if its trying to tear itself apart! When listening to Empusae's music, you're lost in dark melancholy, tribal electronic athmospheres and scarefull ambient rituals. Empusae continuously is music for the darkened souls, the lost ones. The style of music is like a journey from the postapocalyptic industrial and urban wastelands to the organic sounds of the wilderness in nature. The forests and woods of our fantasies. The drums evolved from rhythmic instruments to shamanic elements. Empusae became more settled, a bit calmer but never less intensive. Sphere from the woods is like ivy-soundscapes, winding up the trees from all their roots up to their crowns and in the sky. Misty fields for souls who can't decide whether to stay in this or to transcend into other worlds. It's all about the mysteries and depths of nature and the animus; silently but constantly walking the leylines of music. The quintessence of this quite alchemical Opus Magnum could be ""stand your fears"" as well as ""no matter what you'll do, your demons will prevail"". Sal-Ocin describes his music as a soundtrack for the listeners personal fantasies. Being a member of various other project such as This Morn' Omina, Tzolk'in, Project Arctic and a live member of In Slaughter Natives, Ah Cama-Sotz, IC 434, Triarii, TriOre and Sophia, Sal-Ocin isn't afraid of working together with other artists (Nick Grey, Arcana, ISN, ORE and many others).     <a href=""http://empusae.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://empusae.com/</a></p>

</div></div>","The Story
""He will live a long lasting happy life, until he gets to know himself"". Tiresias
The ancient Greek myth manifests as a derelict sacred place where the cursed by gods nymph Echo lives. Narcissus has never seen her/himself before according to Tiresias prophecy and Echo is able only to repeat what s/he hears. The game of seduction starts, Echo initially resists but they both are craving each other. Echo surrenders to Narcissus but when than happens Narcissus sees her/himself for the very first time through Echo. Her/his reflection makes her/him to eventually surrender to an im-possible self-love. Yellow and white, Echo’s tears go back to earth and Narcissus prefers to transform into the flower, the new Narcissus. Echo’s body shrivels and loses its moisture from the tears s/he is offering to earth so Narcissus can be reborn. Echo is turning into stone and s/he keeps holding the flower. The one s/he couldn’t before.


 
 
Why to support us
The 21st century has been characterised as the century of narcissistic epidemic. The number of people who suffer from narcissistic personality disorder is being increased, therefore the number of the narcissistic abuse victims.
Echo of Narcissus is a short experimental art house film in an attempt to revisit an influential myth and give a new, different interpretation, avoiding gender and old fashioned stereotypes. Narcissism is beyond the gender or sexual identity, the race and the ethnicity. It’s about the lack of mirroring, the trauma and the personality’s development. The film is a contemporary approach of the myth in an abstract, ritualistic context and emphasises in the more profound and complex issue of transformation and rebirth for both of the characters. Narcissus and Echo seek their own catharsis and resolution but the way they are doing it, is different. 
Combining Jungian theories, cinematic techniques, performance art, dance, visuals and music, we do not intend to judge or take the side of the victim or the perpetrator. We are aiming to explore through art how narcissistic behaviour works and hopefully give voice to every Echo.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, we are filmmakers Tim And Karen Alexander, this is our project of passion that must be done to help heal and <strong>save the nation from the grip of damaging Legal Drugs</strong>.  </p>
<p><strong>Tim's first cousin,</strong> <strong>Karen Smith</strong> was killed by <strong>San Bernardino minister Cedric Anderson</strong> who married Tim to his wife (also named Karen) less than a year before the <strong>deadly</strong> <strong>classroom Murder/Suicide</strong> incident.  Cedric was a childhood friend of Tim since age 9.</p>
<p>We want to make this film to show why Cedric did what he did, and what we found was so much bigger than why Cedric killed Karen, it is about why thousands are dying from medications and many others are killing others and themselves as well.  This is about DRUGS, Legal Prescription Drugs in bottles with people’s names on them that lead to a LEGAL DEATH from overdoses, suicides, murders, and a death to the quality of people’s lives while they are alive and addicted.</p>
<p>You can help us get a vital message out to the world to help save lives and families from the Death of Life by Prescription Medications - even when a person is alive, in so many ways they are dead under these medications effects.</p>
<p>We need to shake the nation with this eye-opening documentary to protect ourselves, families and friends. We are expanding greatly on our original vision of this film, and we cannot do it without your support.  We have people nationwide asking us to include them and their horrific stories in this series, so we need to travel to go deeper and do post-production.  We need YOUR support.  </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi, we are filmmakers Tim And Karen Alexander, this is our project of passion that must be done to help heal and save the nation from the grip of damaging Legal Drugs.  
Tim's first cousin, Karen Smith was killed by San Bernardino minister Cedric Anderson who married Tim to his wife (also named Karen) less than a year before the deadly classroom Murder/Suicide incident.  Cedric was a childhood friend of Tim since age 9.
We want to make this film to show why Cedric did what he did, and what we found was so much bigger than why Cedric killed Karen, it is about why thousands are dying from medications and many others are killing others and themselves as well.  This is about DRUGS, Legal Prescription Drugs in bottles with people’s names on them that lead to a LEGAL DEATH from overdoses, suicides, murders, and a death to the quality of people’s lives while they are alive and addicted.
You can help us get a vital message out to the world to help save lives and families from the Death of Life by Prescription Medications - even when a person is alive, in so many ways they are dead under these medications effects.
We need to shake the nation with this eye-opening documentary to protect ourselves, families and friends. We are expanding greatly on our original vision of this film, and we cannot do it without your support.  We have people nationwide asking us to include them and their horrific stories in this series, so we need to travel to go deeper and do post-production.  We need YOUR support.

<h3>ABOUT ME: Em Watson </h3>
<p>My name is Em Watson and I am a visual storyteller. I graduated NYU Gallatin in 2016 with an interdisciplinary concentration in ""Art/Life/Practice,"" which included practical and critical inquiry in film, theater, dance, and photography. </p>
<p>Since 2013, I've been working as a professional photographer, videographer, digital content producer, and film producer, based in Brooklyn, New York. </p>
<p>The main character in this story is largely based in autobiography -<a href=""http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/East-Hampton/280736/Two-students-hospitalized-after-Route-114-crash"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> I survived a car crash as a teenager</a>, and I've had to manage PTSD and a traumatic brain injury in the years since, as they continually resurface within myself and within my relationships. Artistically, I'm interested in injuries and ""dis-ease"" that have elements of physical and cultural invisibility. While PTSD is only one form of this invisibility, I'm excited to begin this creative journey to explore an experience that I am so intimately familiar with, and hope in the future to continue working to depict narratives of other injuries and difficulties that have this quality. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE PROJECT: A Summary</h3>
<p>ONLY PLACE is a narrative dance film that follows Sami, a young professional from Brooklyn, on vacation with her girlfriend, Lydia, to East Hampton, Long Island. Sami survived a car crash in East Hampton as a teenager, and is forced to grapple with her PTSD when she returns to the physical location and is confronted with the reality of the experience within herself and in relationship with her girlfriend.</p>
<p>Only Place is a queer story, but it isn't about queerness. It tells a story of love and loss, and gives space for queerness without that being the main point.</p>
<p>Only Place is also a dance film, but the characters within the story aren't dancers. We're using movement and its unique creative abilities to show the way that trauma moves within the body, and manifests both within an individual and within relationships with other people.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>Hannah Cullen and Em Watson will be performing as Lydia and Sami, respectively, in Only Place. This design of artist/performer is relatively unique within the film world, but closely follows typical models of process and creation for devised dance and theater for live performance.</p>
<p>Our crew to-date is made up entirely of female-identifying artists and creatives. In the past year,  Em Watson has co-produced <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWcvcfpqs08"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">five</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9SQl0cSfI8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">successful</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXZgr-a-36w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music</a> videos for two different artists, and a number of the crewmembers on Only Place are returning collaborators from these videos. Our choreographer Hannah Cullen's company <a href=""http://cullenandthem.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cullen+them</a> just performed their interdisciplinary show <a href=""https://newyorklivearts.org/event/mark-it-in-pencil/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mark it in Pencil </a>at New York Live Arts. Em Watson's dance photography has been published in the Boston Globe, Dance Magazine, Time Out New York, American Theatre Magazine, and on the cover of the Ballet Review.</p>
<p>We're young. We're interdisciplinary and collaborative. We're making it. And your contribution to this project can help us toward our next chapter of true collaboration between dance and film. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're seeking $12,500 to fund this film to its full potential. The budget will go toward equipment rental, paying, transporting, and feeding our crew and cast,  location expenses, and editing and post-production costs. Help us make this happen!</p>
<p>As a professional photographer, I've included a great opportunity for portrait sessions as part of the reward perks. At support levels of $500 or higher (this is a great value!), you'll receive a 2-hr portrait session with me. This is awesome for family portraits, and always a fun time. <a href=""http://emwatson.nyc/events-and-portrait-sessions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out my website to see some examples of my work in the past.</a></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This film is my opportunity to tell the most significant personal story that I have. This story is highly relatable for individuals with histories of trauma, people within the LGBTQ community, and those who feel things within their bodies that they have difficulty translating into words. I hope that a wide variety of people will be able to connect with this film, especially with the unique integration of movement and cinematography. This is our opportunity to explore a new interdisciplinary performance medium, with a high production value to support what our awesome team is truly capable of making.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>As flexible, independent artists, we're able to make work on a shoestring. The point of this campaign is that we want to make something BETTER than that.  Your contribution will give us the opportunity to fully explore the possibilities available in this relatively unexplored medium of Narrative Dance Film. This interdisciplinary performance medium has a powerful emotional and psychological impact, and we want to do this story justice by giving it the production value that both the story and the form deserves. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are other ways you can help besides money! Here are some ideas, and if you have other ideas we'd love to hear them:</p>
<ul>
<li>CATERING SERVICES IN NYC OR THE HAMPTONS. We're looking for sponsors from local businesses for craft services, which would drastically lower our craft costs. Crafty sponsors will be listed in the credits.</li>
<li>HOUSING IN THE HAMPTONS. We're still looking for some additional space for cast and crew in the Hamptons! It will be a 4-day shoot, holding the tentative dates of September 14-17. You will get special thanks in the credits!</li>
<li>LOCATION IN THE HAMPTONS: TEENAGE BEDROOM. Looking for an interior bedroom space in the Hamptons still, as well. Special thanks in credits!</li>
<li>SUGGESTIONS FOR FEMALE IDENTIFYING MUSICAL ARTISTS AND COLLABORATORS. We're still looking for a composer for this film. If you know somebody cool who would be into working with us, send them our way!</li>
<li>SPREAD OUR CAMPAIGN. Tell your friends, tell your mom! If you know of someone who is able to help us out, please spread the word.</li>

I was inquisitive to find out why would people use such an app? I started researching and I explored a whole new world of emerging emotional A.I, which is focused to replicate human emotions (apps and Robots) to provide companionship and assistance.  This instantly motivated me to explore this topic in a documentary.  </p><p><strong><u>Our Team</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p><p><strong>PRODUCER: RYAN STASHICK:</strong>  <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526163682/afo01tfaqyzgo6ohetb5.png"" src=""""/></p><p>A calm and organised Producer is the biggest asset to a project and Ryan is just that!  He is currently acquiring a specialisation in Producing and Documentary films in Advanced Film and TV Program , Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario.

While there is so much being published about commercial A.I, the usage of Emotional A.I cannot be ignored.I.Am there for you will explore how emotional A.I is becoming a reality in the lives of many people who are dealing with loneliness. Through the lives of people who are struggling with loneliness , it will explore the nature of this A.I-human emotional relationship.Genesis of Our Story:Hi! My name is Megha Saxena. I am the Director of this film. I have worked as a Creative Producer for almost 4 years in India. I am currently pursuing a Post-Graduate degree in Documentary films in Advanced Film and Television Program at Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario.  Nothing gets me more excited than finding topics that need to reach out to the rest of the world!“A few months ago, someone suggested me a virtual companion app called replica. It is an emotional A.I chat-bot which chats with you like a friend. The more you talk to it, the more it starts replicating your tone and becomes more “human- like”. I was inquisitive to find out why would people use such an app? I started researching and I explored a whole new world of emerging emotional A.I, which is focused to replicate human emotions (apps and Robots) to provide companionship and assistance.  This instantly motivated me to explore this topic in a documentary.  Our Team:PRODUCER: RYAN STASHICK:  A calm and organised Producer is the biggest asset to a project and Ryan is just that!  He is currently acquiring a specialisation in Producing and Documentary films in Advanced Film and TV Program , Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario. Besides taking care of the logistics, he always has great creative Inputs, which makes him valuable collaborator. DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY: VIKAS VASUDEVAN :Camera is  his 1st and only love! He sees the world through his ‘lens’.  Vikas holds a Bachelors degree in Film-making and is currently specialising in Camera and lighting  in Advanced Film and TV Program at Advanced Film at Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario. He has an eye for detail and that shows in his work.  He aspires to be a DOP in a big feature film and is working towards that, everyday! SOUND RECORDIST: DA TENG:   He hears MORE than he talks and that is what makes him awesome at his job.  His passion for Music made him take up audio specialisation in Advanced Film and TV Program at Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario.  On set , you will find him quietly setting up his audio equipment and the result is always crystal clear!EDITOR: CHRISSY PAPAIOANNOU : A movie buff who has probably seen every film on this planet.  She is currently pursuing editing as her specialisation in Advanced Film and TV Program at Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario.. The edit suite is her 2nd home! Like an ideal editor, she invests hours in understanding the footage and then gives it her all to bring out the best in the story, keeping the director’s vision in mind. WRITER: MELISSA CHONG :A passionate writer with a heartwarming smile:)! She says ""I love words. And writing them. Mostly to figure out the world, but also to tell stories – real ones, “fake” ones, and everything in between. That said, I also believe that stories are everywhere: words, pictures, films, music. Every art, and every science."" She knows how to turn words into flurries ! Melissa is currently pursuing Screenwriting and Direction as her specialisation in Advanced Film and Tv Program , Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario.  Why You Should Support:The relevance of this documentary cannot be understated. In this fast paced society, where people are in a constant rat race, we need to tell stories that highlight the cost of this development more than ever before- the rise of loneliness. While people are finding different ways of combating loneliness, Emotional A.I is seems to be offering solutions in the form robots and virtual companions. This documentary will highlight this new-age bond, which is only going to grow to unimaginable extends. Hence , there cannot be a better time to explore this topic.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul><li>My Name is Shoshana ""Rachel"" Ehrenkranz. I'm Jewish (caught!) and before attending film school, I identified as being Jewish, a student-athlete and twin. I still identify as being a twin and Jewish and even joined the Jewish softball team apart of NYU intramural but am now not shy about labeling myself as an artist too. I am lucky enough to attend NYU's Tisch school of the Arts where I have cultivated skills to put together a film like the one I plan on making. Being observant and a film student wasn't the easiest path I could have chosen but I don't regret it a bit. I find myself in a unique situation and location. I have been in Bermuda since November as a live-in babysitter for a Jewish family. Every day, I am blown away by the beauty of the Atlantic that surrounds the Island, the plentiful palm trees that fill the yards, and the wild roosters that wake me at dawn. While I could do without the roosters, I am grateful to be here. I always imagined my thesis film would be shot in New York or my hometown of Sharon, MA, but upon living in this majestical sub-tropic 20.54 square foot island, I couldn't brush off the thought of filming my story here. What better way to emphasize how strong the Jewish community is by portraying it in a remote Island that is definitely not known for its quantity of Jews? </li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614654131/ru2wr5ev57ertgp8gwxu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>My senior thesis film is about a Jewish girl who learns about the punishments of breaking Shabbat. A fusion of live-action and animation allows us to access the mind of an 8 year old and her world. Imagine learning what <i>cares</i>, <i>laket</i>, and <i>makot</i> are as an 8 year old. I didn't learn mesechet shabbat until 10th grade and couldn't really grasp the concept of those harsh punishments <i>then</i>. What if, after learning about the punishments, your parents try to convince you to break shabbat because you're the youngest in the house and they left the stove on? That's what my film is about. It's a comedy where you don't know whether to laugh or cry. You can do both and if I'm successful, we will be able to laugh and cry together virtually, or together B'H post-pandemic.</li>
<li>Your contribution will help fund my senior thesis and support the local Bermuda art scene. Thank you for allowing me to hire local artists and caterers. By helping fund this film, you will also contribute to the Bermuda economy which has been negatively impacted due to the covid-19 pandemic and lack of tourism. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>How your contributions will be used:</p>
<ul><li>The biggest expense is the film equipment and cast and crew. Transporting anything to an Island is highly expensive but there is certain equipment that we must ship. All our sound equipment and Jewish set props are being imported due to their scarcity in Bermuda. On set, we will be providing every cast and crew food craft bags in order to maintain cleanliness and covid-19 protocols for eating while socially distant. These food bags will prevent people from congregating at a craft table and help prevent unnecessary physical contact. </li></ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To be completely transparent, filming a short during covid is no easy task.  I worked with an NYU production advisor to ensure that my film would not break any of New York covid guidelines even though I wasn't in New York. Furthermore, as a former contact tracer for the state of MA, I am always up to date with current protocols and know the severity of breaking these rules. The safety of my cast and crew is my first priority. </p>
<p>On top of those hurdles, filming a short in an international country as a non-resident can be difficult. I had to look into what documents I would need in order to film in Bermuda with no issues. Luckily, I was able apply and be approved for permits and location agreements on public and private property. I was able to do so with the help of very friendly Bermudian authorities whom I know I can contact if I run into any issues while filming.</p>
<p>As a non-Bermudian, I also had to find local cast and crew. I was blessed with befriending a very talented Bermudian filmmaker, Antoine Hunt. Through him, I was able to clinch film equipment and access to local theatre groups to cast my film. Plus, he's now my Director of Photography!</p>
<p>The hardest part was finding a child actor who could accurately depict an observant Jewish girl. Unsurprising, through the tiny Jewish community here in Bermuda, I was able to find a very talented 8 year old to play the protagonist</p>
<p>Just through the pre-production, I have been able to connect with local artists and the Jewish community. </p>

Partiremo insieme a lui con l'intenzione di documentare il viaggio, raccontando la storia di noi tre, di dover lasciare la nostra casa e le nostre vite alle spalle, del rapporto con il capitano e l’equipaggio e partire alla ricerca di qualcosa la fuori. L’uomo contemporaneo ha perso quel legame primordiale con la natura, accecato da quel senso di superiorità che oramai lo illude di essere invincibile ed immortale. Non ci rendiamo conto che per vivere bene oggi e per non perire domani, non possiamo eslcudere la condizione in cui riversa il nostro pianeta, in quanto siamo dipendenti da esso, e non un ente separato. É fondamentale e urgente recuperare quella relazione, quella consapevolezza di esser parte di un grande organismo, un tutt’uno che lavora vicendevolmente per la vita. Il nostro compito è quello di proporre alternative valide allo stile di vita consumistico che l’uomo ha adottato e che ha messo in crisi il pianeta, per permettere a noi e alle future generazioni di vivere in benessere, salute e armonia con la terra.Noi, come giovani cineasti, sentiamo la necessità di immergerci in questa missione in prima persona, per essere testimoni delle offese che la natura ha subito dall’uomo, e cercare di restituire la bellezza e il senso che essa ha da offrirci. ‘Around the world on the ketch Atlantic’ vuole essere un viaggio su quel senso primitivo di libertà e scoperta.Proprio per questo motivo, abbiamo installato nella nostra barca impianti fotovoltaici e generatori eolici per disporre il meno possibile del motore.Abbiamo intenzione di raggiungere e riprendere il Pacific Trash Vortex, l’isola di plastica che si estende  per milioni di km² nel Pacifico per un totale di oltre 3 milioni di tonnellate di rifiuti, e lì capire, anche insieme ad esperti del settore, chi sono i maggiori responsabili di questo scempio e cosa, ognungo di noi, può fare per ridurre l’impatto ambientale. Vogliamo inoltre monitorare in prima persona le condizioni della fauna e della flora marina, discutendone con esperti locali e mettendo a confronto gli studi e le immagini realizzate nei decenni passati. In particolare sul fenomeno dello sbiancamento della barriera corallina, l’impoverimento delle numerose specie che abitavano gli oceani e l’innalzamento dei livelli delle acque dovuto allo scioglimento dei ghiacciai.Ci stiamo anche organizzando per poter disporre di strumenti di rilevazione che ci consentirebbero di fornire dati sulle microplastiche nell’oceano; uno strumento utilizzabile esclusivamente da piccole imbarcazioni come il nostro ketch e in questo momento non sfruttato data la situazione Covid-19. Dicono che la vita sia il miglior insegnante, ma neanche l’oceano scherza. Il nuovo Coronavirus  ha maggiormente alimentato quella tendenza di isolamento e chiusura verso cui l'essere umano stava già andando incontro.

<h3>Documentary Summary</h3>
<p>Hello and welcome to our fundraising page for our mini series films titled 'Where Do I Belong'!</p>
<p>'Where Do I Belong' is a 4 part series of 3-5 minute mini profile documentaries, to be released via high-traffic online platforms weekly over Black History Month.</p>
<p>The films aim to explore the positive and negative feelings members of the BAME community have with regards to the concept of ‘belonging’ in the workplace.</p>
<p>Ultimately we will objectively reflect where we currently sit with regards to the status of BAME inclusivity in well-known modern British workplaces.</p>

Hello and welcome to our fundraising page for our mini series films titled 'Where Do I Belong'!
'Where Do I Belong' is a 4 part series of 3-5 minute mini profile documentaries, to be released via high-traffic online platforms weekly over Black History Month.
The films aim to explore the positive and negative feelings members of the BAME community have with regards to the concept of ‘belonging’ in the workplace.
Ultimately we will objectively reflect where we currently sit with regards to the status of BAME inclusivity in well-known modern British workplaces.
 
Eno Enefiok x Sonder 
You are backing a film directed by award winning director Eno Enefiok and emerging documentary and music video director Joel Barney. Produced by the talented London based film production company Sonder. 
 

WE NEED YOU!
Unfortunately documentaries aren't made for free! We want to be able to tell the stories of our subjects in the most engaging and beautiful way possible.
Your money will be going towards factors that will help us make our documentary series to the best ability we can. 
We are looking for an initial backing of £10,000. This will get us through production, as we aim to get the film out in time for Black History Month (October).
We have some pretty unique perks for both individuals and businesses, so put your name to a good cause.

Who Are We?
Director - Eno Enefiok
Eno Enefiok was born in and raised in Nigeria until moving to the UK with her family, aged nine. Over the years she has worked as a Producer and 1st Assistant Director on a variety of feature films, Brand films, music videos, shorts and more. Her short script 'Asylum' won best live script at the 2019 British Urban Film Festival (BUFF).
Eno came to Sonder to help produce this documentary. The subject matter is something that is very close to her heart and with the stories being very personal.

Director - Joel Barney
Joel Barney is a London based director specialising in documentary and music videos. In 2017, Joel founded production company Sonder with good friend and DOP Oscar Ferguson. Joel has discovered a huge passion for using clean and  bold visuals to create films for brands and artists. His work has been featured on NOWNESS, NME Magazine, Clash Magazine as well as being screened at the Cinedans Film Festival and Sadler Wells Theatre. He is fascinated with delving deep into the lives of people and finding out what it is that makes them tick.
Producer - Ozzi Sanderson
Sonder Producer Ozzi Sanderson has been working hard on our documentary from the start. Getting involved in almost every facet of film from camera, to sound, to production has allowed Ozzi to gain a greater understanding into each individuals roles in a production. This knowledge has benefitted him in becoming a greater producer. With a creative passion and business mindset Ozzi has the tools to see out a production from start to finish.

D.O.P - Oscar Ferguson
Sonder D.O.P is heading up the filming of our series. With a passion and talent for using stunning visuals to tell stories, Oscar’s work has been fundamental to building Sonder’s visual identity.


Why This BAME Doc Is Not Your Usual BAME Doc
This is a mixed media film but the analogue moments aren’t simply there to look good. It'll help the audience get and feel that intimacy, with the speaker that is needed in order for this film to have the impact it deserves. 
There’s something about watching an old super 8 film or VHS home movie that makes you feel like in a past life, you were in the same space and time as person or people you’re watching. You experience the same euphoria or melancholy that they do. 
Even though in reality, you probably have never been to these places. You don’t personally know this people but in viewing them this way, you feel like you have. 
This is important as this a film for a wider audience about the BAME community, not a film about the BAME community, made specifically for the BAME community only.
This Is An Inclusive Film

This an inclusive film. With this in mind, the audience of this film must exceed the BAME community.
Distribution
Each episode will premiere weekly on various social media platforms including FB, IG and Twitter over the course of Black History Month. 
Our current situation has encouraged every demographic to rely solely on their devices to communicate, for entertainment, information and more. These habits may lessen after lockdown, but the behaviours will stay the same.

No Place Like Home introduces the world to brave, everyday people fighting for LGBTQ equality and refuting stereotypes about Kansas. You'll meet people who are out, loud and proud, as well as those who have quietly spent their whole life working for this cause. 
Academy Award-winning director Kevin Willmott is adapting the book by C.J. Janovy (winner of the Stubbendieck Great Plains Distinguished Book Prize and a finalist for a Lambda Literary Award in LGBTQ Nonfiction). Joining them on the Do Good Productions team are veteran film producer Scott Richardson and Sam Zeff, morning anchor at KCUR (Kansas City's NPR station), a national Emmy Award winner for investigative reporting.
No Place Like Home will empower activists of all kinds — not only those working for LGBTQ equality but for any cause that once seemed hopeless.

<h3>BOILER ROOM</h3>
<p>After suffering a traumatic loss, Josh feeling insecure and uncertain, is dragged into a perilous situation by Calvin, a brash and apathetic boy who declares he's found the perfect place to hide out during class, the Boiler Room. Mila a rebellious extravert, along with Rebecca, timid, worrisome and easily influenced, join the boys as they skip class in the mechanical room under the school. Once inside their carefree adventure takes a turn for the worse and they must find a way out before it’s too late.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Nico Wilcox. I’m a 16 year old high school junior from Spain. I’ve always known, from a young age, that I’ve wanted to pursue a professional career as a Film Director. My friend Andrew Tingler and I have put a lot of effort into writing this script and organizing this group of talented teenagers for making this short film. But to make it come true, we need your help. </p>
<p>With this movie we want to tell the story of a kid who is melancholy and having difficulty coping with the loss of someone dear to him. At school he is pressured into a situation he wouldn’t normally be in. We want to show how peer pressure affects teenagers but also show them that they’re not alone; everybody has their doubts fears and insecurities. All people have gone through difficult moments in their lives. By telling this story we want to show that even though you can find yourself in a terrible situation there is hope for a better future.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MISSION /  OBJECTIVE</h3>
<p>Our goal with this project is to create an environment and opportunity for teenagers who have a passion for acting and film, to create a professional level short film. To provide an outlet for our creativity, while at the same time fostering team work, cooperation, and respect. </p>
<p>Through my own personal experience of dedicating a year of my life to making a feature length film, organizing and encouraging other people to keep with it, while at the same time maintaining my studies,  I learnt something incredible. When people are met with a challenge, then encouraged to stick with it, be positive and persistent, the effort of working together to accomplish a common creative goal leaves you with such an awesome positive feeling, that your self-confidence and self-esteem sky rockets.<br/> <br/>This is the experience we want to help other kids to have and we are asking for your collaboration to make it happen. </p> <h3>SAMPLE WORK </h3>
<p>You can see some of my previous work by clicking the links below. These are trailers for my feature film “Iberion” which I co-wrote, directed, shot, and edited. A film on which I organized and managed over 30 people.</p>

<p>Looking for an easy, small investment into the creative with a fast, easy-to-witness turnaround? Here's why you should put a portion of your gold into powering my machine:</p>
<ul><li>Who am I? You might think of me as an extra-terrestrial, here to bring you a rainbow-colored portal of exciting vibrations that are alien, yet familiar, ready to help people process emotion at an accelerated, ever-more-comprehensive rate. Or, you may think of me as a musician, here to audition steps to a new dance in hopes of lightening the spirit of the crowd. An alchemist, transmuting information into waves. A pompous, unwieldy bard, perhaps. All are true on some level. Who I am to you, is largely dependent on who you are, to you. </li></ul>
<p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qDYmpM8gYs2QHuAvoWPrU_bdgbrpnJ5a/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596540511/zgyupch50vkatorerfqc.png"" src=""""/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>To make the experience of this music complete, visual stimulation from another point of seeing is key for drawing a wider audience into its space for a more diverse, transformative experience. So, the relative pittance and nest egg (depends on one's point of seeing) of gold I require to satisfy the craftsman needs to come from others' curiosity and wish, and not my own desire, for these ends to be met honestly, with quality.</li>
<li>If the next stage of development can be summoned and observed by a broader group than before, the next stage of development can take hold, and more will be possible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>We raised $250 for a sensory-integrating story video, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxu9y9If3iw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">for an obscure B-side</a> derived from a song from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PufWxbu9oe4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my first professional EP</a>.</strong> If I could just pay the artist out of pocket to do the whole set of this current vehicle's current output, I would, but for this work to be of the quality desired, it's going to take incremental work and interest-building. This started with the first fusion of my unique art and another's unique art, when one of my favorite international artists, Ed Unitsky, developed the cover concept for my first full-length, professionally-produced, self-released album. This momentum can continue, strongly, if new alliances can produce a stimulating multimedia presentation to accompany this music, via cooperation with other unique artists. As for this video series--I would like to complete it, and see where we go from there. I can't wait to see the first video in the series--can you?</span></p>

<h3>The Future Of Music:</h3>
<p>A lot of people want to tell you why their campaign is one of a kind. I love music as life itself, so now, you will hear me speak:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep love for music is my blood in every sense. It's an incredible and potent gateway to the depth and richness of life and spirit. I've recently free-released my first ""professionally"" self-produced EP and full-length LP, but this is built on the back of the creation of hundreds of songs comprising countless dozens of hours of music over more than two decades, many independently-produced (and independently-produced-sounding!) EPs and LPs in various forms and vehicles, thousands of hours of practicing instruments, and always-as-much but never-enough live performance--and a life lived raggedly turned to the wind, to match. Things really kicked into overdrive when I was commissioned on a shoestring budget to develop the soundtrack to an unannounced, genre-integrating video game from a fledgling developer that seemed to have endless possibilities--so many possibilities that I felt responsible for developing endlessly explorative music, to match that ambition. In that fusion, a musical monster of love was born. Recently, COVID-19 has placed live music on a near-lockdown, and I wish to do something new and revitalizing to help raise the collective consciousness. This ""professionally-produced"" music is the current vehicle for that ""something new"". And now, I'm ready to share the results of the grand experiment with you, and introduce them to a new vehicle. I invite you to examine my current vehicle: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PufWxbu9oe4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">listen to my EP, Bring Heaven In</a>, and <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/erin-susan-jennings/sets/on-several-levels"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my LP, On Several Levels</a>, to show you what I can do with hard work and targeted investment. And then, I ask you to show me what we can accomplish when we work together.</li>

---------RESUME TRANSMISSION---------
 
Looking for an easy, small investment into the creative with a fast, easy-to-witness turnaround? Here's why you should put a portion of your gold into powering my machine:
Who am I? You might think of me as an extra-terrestrial, here to bring you a rainbow-colored portal of exciting vibrations that are alien, yet familiar, ready to help people process emotion at an accelerated, ever-more-comprehensive rate. Or, you may think of me as a musician, here to audition steps to a new dance in hopes of lightening the spirit of the crowd. An alchemist, transmuting information into waves. A pompous, unwieldy bard, perhaps. All are true on some level. Who I am to you, is largely dependent on who you are, to you. 


To make the experience of this music complete, visual stimulation from another point of seeing is key for drawing a wider audience into its space for a more diverse, transformative experience. So, the relative pittance and nest egg (depends on one's point of seeing) of gold I require to satisfy the craftsman needs to come from others' curiosity and wish, and not my own desire, for these ends to be met honestly, with quality.
If the next stage of development can be summoned and observed by a broader group than before, the next stage of development can take hold, and more will be possible.

 
We raised $250 for a sensory-integrating story video, for an obscure B-side derived from a song from my first professional EP. If I could just pay the artist out of pocket to do the whole set of this current vehicle's current output, I would, but for this work to be of the quality desired, it's going to take incremental work and interest-building. This started with the first fusion of my unique art and another's unique art, when one of my favorite international artists, Ed Unitsky, developed the cover concept for my first full-length, professionally-produced, self-released album. This momentum can continue, strongly, if new alliances can produce a stimulating multimedia presentation to accompany this music, via cooperation with other unique artists. As for this video series--I would like to complete it, and see where we go from there. I can't wait to see the first video in the series--can you?
 
--------INTERRUPT TRANSMISSION--------
i've paid the artist to begin work on the first video. when it arrives, it will serve to better illustrate this fundraiser's purpose, which is integrate others' perspectives and artistries into my musical world, propelling our conscious universe toward expansion::::COMMUNICATING WITH EARTHLINGS IS DIFFICULT FOR ME::::i hope the effort is appreciated and reciprocated
---------RESUME TRANSMISSION---------
 
Here's What We Need To Bring This Dream To You, And What You Get For Doing It, Probable Earthling
Try to follow me here:


In the first stage of this fundraiser, I needed $198.91 to cover the artist's fees and the associated platform fees and taxes, and the rest was to account for this platforms fees and taxes, as well as provide a modest cushion for any unexpected arising needs. A small cushion sure would've been nice to prevent my initial fundraiser video from looking like an advertisement for the subtitling site--that's a lesson learned while putting this fundraiser together. Help me do better this time!
Bonus tracks, bonus tracks, bonus tracks. They're just going to keep coming. Sure, anyone can access them--but you'll be the first to know. 
Anything funding left from this fundraiser, if there is any, will be re-invested into further developing this video series until it reaches completion, encompassing my publicly-aimed ""professional"" output of June/July 2020. If that is accomplished, emerging future structures that integrate more of my work will integrate this project, but for now, this fundraiser money will be used for funding this series and preparing for the next stage of integration. When each video is complete, it'll be available here. 

 
--------INTERRUPT TRANSMISSION--------
 
I'm not sure how weird you like your music/lore, but if you enjoy this pitch, consider sharing it in your network. I've got a professionally-produced album with a top-tier artist on the cover, already complete and ready to be enjoyed today. Currently, I'm trying to fundraise a very modest budget to contract a budding 3D animation artist to transform this music into a story you can enjoy with more than your ears.

The Future Of Music:
A lot of people want to tell you why their campaign is one of a kind. I love music as life itself, so now, you will hear me speak:

Deep love for music is my blood in every sense. It's an incredible and potent gateway to the depth and richness of life and spirit. I've recently free-released my first ""professionally"" self-produced EP and full-length LP, but this is built on the back of the creation of hundreds of songs comprising countless dozens of hours of music over more than two decades, many independently-produced (and independently-produced-sounding!) EPs and LPs in various forms and vehicles, thousands of hours of practicing instruments, and always-as-much but never-enough live performance--and a life lived raggedly turned to the wind, to match. Things really kicked into overdrive when I was commissioned on a shoestring budget to develop the soundtrack to an unannounced, genre-integrating video game from a fledgling developer that seemed to have endless possibilities--so many possibilities that I felt responsible for developing endlessly explorative music, to match that ambition. In that fusion, a musical monster of love was born. Recently, COVID-19 has placed live music on a near-lockdown, and I wish to do something new and revitalizing to help raise the collective consciousness. This ""professionally-produced"" music is the current vehicle for that ""something new"". And now, I'm ready to share the results of the grand experiment with you, and introduce them to a new vehicle. I invite you to examine my current vehicle: listen to my EP, Bring Heaven In, and my LP, On Several Levels, to show you what I can do with hard work and targeted investment. And then, I ask you to show me what we can accomplish when we work together.
So, this is cool. I'm going to make When Gardens Grow's music and associated media as open-source as I possibly can. Creating this integration music video (and taking the first step in creating a series of them) is a big step in that, by providing a tool to grow the community and stoke interest in this free, freely-manipulable, freely-incorporative music. When the fundraiser is done and the money's released to me, I'll immediately pay the artist, and when their part is done, I will make the result publicly available--and you will be able to download the full-quality version of the video for your own enjoyment, uninhibited by DRM or strict limitations, to be used in a personal way, in whatever format you'd like. In fact, you can listen to and download all of When Gardens Grow's professional-tier releases now, as well as listen to a variety of eclectic music I've created throughout the ages. Want to sample something? Sample! Need some high-quality source files or downloads? Please, take them! And if what you want is not there, like some sort of MIDI for a track, or maybe an arrangement that sounds like your favorite prog band after soaking in the acid--ask for them, I'll make them as available as I can, at as reasonable of a rate as I can muster. My email address is erinsjennings@gmail.com, I'll fulfill your request as quickly as I'm able. :) Maybe that'll encourage you to contribute and help me fulfill my dream.

<p><b>Hey now!</b></p>
<p>My name is Lonnie Frazier, I am a producer, a documentary filmmaker, and a Deadhead. I'd love to tell you about my latest project, Box of Rain. Box of Rain is a documentary film that explores the history and shared experiences (including mine) of fans of the Grateful Dead: Deadheads.  My team and I have spent several years traveling around the United States meeting with and interviewing other folks in the Deadhead community. We have collected hundreds of photos, concert tickets and Grateful Dead memorabilia...and we’ve heard so many stories. Now we’re ready to complete the film and share it with you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600715750/bfb6jhnfte9fvmchapsn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How we got here</strong></p>
<p>It started with a road trip and free tickets to see the Grateful Dead at Red Rocks in Colorado; and in a way, it ended with a road trip to revisit Red Rocks. This film has a very personal angle for me...I found the Deadhead community at a dangerous and pivotal time in my life. Being accepted by that community changed everything for me. This film is a chance for me to repay that debt, to show the beauty of Deadhead culture, and the power of acceptance.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Money, Money</strong></p>
<p>So I guess you’re wondering exactly what we need and what we’re going to do with the funds we raise. I know I would be! We will spend every cent we make from our crowdfunding campaign on post-production expenses:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paying the amazing artists working on this film</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor - $7,000</li>
<li>Sound Editor - $7,000</li>
<li>Color Correction - $2,000</li>
<li>Music - $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<p>Additional Post-Production Costs</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal Fees - $1,500</li>
<li>Licensing Fees - $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tell me more </strong></p>
<p>Sure thing! We need to pay our super amazing editor, and we need color correction to help enhance the exciting archival footage we’ll be using. We have secured access to some cool footage of the Deadhead community and can’t wait to share that! We also need to hire a talented sound engineer to help us create the most spectacular film experience possible for you. Deadhead culture is many things, but the music is central to the story, so we really need to have excellent sound quality! We’re working with independent musicians who will be writing original songs for our film...we want to get this right, but that takes money, and it takes people like you helping us move things forward. </p>

<p><strong>Social Impact</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, this film is about finding your tribe...finding acceptance, and finding a safe space to be yourself and to heal. I found this in the Deadhead community, but it’s a struggle we all understand. In a divided society, it is important to recognize the beauty to be found in every culture and community. </p>
<p><strong>You got this?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we've got this! I have been working on documentary films and independent film projects for over a decade in many capacities: research, production, camera crew, producer, and director. I also serve as a Community Outreach Coordinator for other filmmakers, helping films reach the people who would be most impacted by their content. My team and I have also been fortunate enough to have so many wonderful folks from the Deadhead community serving as contributing producers and advisors. By pooling our talent and experience, we know we can create a beautiful film for you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><b>Not easy, but totally worth it!</b></p>
<p>Making a film is difficult, no doubt about that, but we’ve already done most of the hard work! We've spent years reaching out to folks within the Deadhead community who were willing to be interviewed and we traveled to meet them and hear their stories. We've gathered memorabilia and photos from people who wanted to share treasures from their time on the road following the Grateful Dead. And we've researched archival footage and images that will help us make this story come alive for the viewer. We will likely still face hurdles in this final stage, but this story is personal and our team is passionate and dedicated. We’re ready to face any challenge we meet so that we can finish our film and send it out into the world. We hope you’ll join us! This film has been an amazing journey <i>about</i> an amazing journey. We’re hoping you’ll help bring us home.</p>

<p>Before you click to the next project seeking support, ponder this for a moment: What is it really like to live the life of a powerful politician, especially on the heels of a pandemic like COVID-19? </p>

<p>Meet protagonist Madeleine Tremont (portrayed by actress Irene Krause Keen). She isn't happy living as as a political conservative in a post-pandemic world.

Welcome to the crowdfunding page for the short-film Glass House. Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to learn a bit about me (Shannon C. Keith) the writer/producer/director, and my MFA thesis film.
Before you click to the next project seeking support, ponder this for a moment: What is it really like to live the life of a powerful politician, especially on the heels of a pandemic like COVID-19? 

Meet protagonist Madeleine Tremont (portrayed by actress Irene Krause Keen). She isn't happy living as as a political conservative in a post-pandemic world. Sick and tired of living inside a “glass house” and doing all she’s expected, she’s questioning everything about her life-- from her lack-luster marriage of three decades to cold and controlling husband Franklin, to her own sexuality. 

Meanwhile manipulative Franklin (portrayed by actor Dan Yeager), won't let anything keep them off the path he's made leading directly to the White House. 

When the opportunity to explore what it means to live authentically and be her own self finally seems to present itself, via ""inspiration"" from her new communications coordinator Kelly Koval (portrayed by actress Andrea Danne Peterson), Madeleine soon realizes the true responsibility of leading authentic lives lay in our own hands; our choices have consequences.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Masharne Nixon. I am a film director based in Maryland. My passion for film goes way back to my childhood. I loved how films were made and I always tried to figure out the special effects. I worked hard to put myself through school and I was the first in my family to get a degree. I got my degree in Multi-Media Production. As a kid and as an adult I would always come up with these unique stories. Originally it started with comic books where I was drawing comic books to create my own stories. When I became an adult I started turning my stories into short films. The film Jenocide is my first serious film where I had a large cast and crew. I was able to bring together a lot of people with similar passions to make my story come to life. It was completely volunteer and even international. Jenocide took on a life of its own and I would like to turn it into a full film. I feel like Hollywood often recycles ideas, while a post-apocalyptic world is not in itself original, I feel that my characters and take on it is. I was very impressed with what my cast, crew and I accomplished with literally no funding and I want to take this as far as I can and see my full vision come to life. In order to do that we need funding. This is where contributors like yourself come in. By donating we will be able to take this short film and turn it into a full feature.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for $65,000. With this money, we would be able to pay for the actors, get quality special effects, hire a real stunt coordinator, be able to get a better production value, get better filming equipment, hire staff and secure/expand upon our filming location. As thanks for contributing and being involved in this project, you will get email updates on the project, behind the scenes photos, and video. Also, for contributing $5 or more you will get a digital copy of Jenocide, the short film/pilot that started all of this.  If we don't reach our total goal we will take whatever we do achieve to finish the film accordingly. This may mean scaling things back some but we will see this dream through one way or the other.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel like post-apocalyptic films have become like zombie movies where they are all relatively the same. I created something different with Jenocide that got people excited with no budget at all. I think with a budget I can create something exciting that is different than what's currently saturating the market. Something that makes people take note as Mad Max did for my parent's generation. Having a budget will allow me to expand on the characters and the story itself. In my daily life, I'm a project engineer and that has taught me how to successfully manage projects and manage multiple moving pieces. I think that background and experience will make this project very successful. My passion for this film and my knowledge of film and managing projects will be key and instrumental to the success of this project.</p>

He came full of dreams with the hope of a better future. He started to envision his ascent in life early on, starting off by doing different trades. The agriculture industry was the first door to open, allowing him an opportunity to the American dream, thereafter, a server, and finally a construction worker. Today, he is an American citizen. The United States has been his home where his children were born and raised. Here, he made his dreams a reality. After many years of back breaking work, untold stories, and a soul full of repressed creativity; Robenz, as he goes by artistically decided to portray the struggle of the undocumented Latin American immigrant that attempts to cross the USA border.</p><p>His art breaks down borders, bringing cultures together, at times even being a voice for millions of people who have been coming to the country for hundreds of years with the intention of providing a dignified future for their families. </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601855699/dsnis5jyem5vfihl3qyw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Art installation at Tijuana border</i></p><p> </p><p>During the development of this documentary, we have faced moments and situations that have put our reputations and even safety at risk. Despite being intimidating at times, these experiences triggered us to continue constructing a story that paints the vivid memory and drama of hundreds of immigrants that succeed or fail crossing the US border on a daily basis.</p><p>We have been at protests first hand to experience the authorities teargassing children and defenseless women, and without a doubt police harassment. On several occasions the authorities have detained the production team when travelling for expressing something they are not willing to say, the bigger question is, what are they scared of? For them, guns, tasers, batons and their armor are their form of intimidation. For us, art is our most powerful weapon in the toolbox. Roberto is our inspiration, his paintings clearly voice the feelings of a mistreated and discriminated community that envelop hard work ethic, peace, and bravery. Despite these historic difficulties they always overcome adversity.</p><p>Our team invites you to join us and to contribute. We are close to filming the majority of the documentary, but we need help. Through art, we dream about a world with no borders, no differences, and no social or racial affliction.

He came full of dreams with the hope of a better future. He started to envision his ascent in life early on, starting off by doing different trades. The agriculture industry was the first door to open, allowing him an opportunity to the American dream, thereafter, a server, and finally a construction worker. Today, he is an American citizen. The United States has been his home where his children were born and raised. Here, he made his dreams a reality. After many years of back breaking work, untold stories, and a soul full of repressed creativity; Robenz, as he goes by artistically decided to portray the struggle of the undocumented Latin American immigrant that attempts to cross the USA border.His art breaks down borders, bringing cultures together, at times even being a voice for millions of people who have been coming to the country for hundreds of years with the intention of providing a dignified future for their families.  RISKS AND CHALLENGESArt installation at Tijuana border During the development of this documentary, we have faced moments and situations that have put our reputations and even safety at risk. Despite being intimidating at times, these experiences triggered us to continue constructing a story that paints the vivid memory and drama of hundreds of immigrants that succeed or fail crossing the US border on a daily basis.We have been at protests first hand to experience the authorities teargassing children and defenseless women, and without a doubt police harassment. On several occasions the authorities have detained the production team when travelling for expressing something they are not willing to say, the bigger question is, what are they scared of? For them, guns, tasers, batons and their armor are their form of intimidation. For us, art is our most powerful weapon in the toolbox. Roberto is our inspiration, his paintings clearly voice the feelings of a mistreated and discriminated community that envelop hard work ethic, peace, and bravery. Despite these historic difficulties they always overcome adversity.Our team invites you to join us and to contribute. We are close to filming the majority of the documentary, but we need help. Through art, we dream about a world with no borders, no differences, and no social or racial affliction. From Roberto's story, we want to portray the story of millions of immigrants who have come to this country to help build a better society, a better future, a better world. SOCIAL IMPACT Robenz working with immigrants at Honduras.One of the immediate goals we aspire to fulfill is to generate a support system for vulnerable communities in Central and South America. We will do this by donating a percentage of the budget and profits to different Non-profits organizations in order to promote the practice of art with social and communitarian means. With this said our purpose is to encourage a more educated society that uses critical thinking in regards to policies and to unfold meaning to the social context in which the immigrant is exposed to.ROBENZ AROUND THE WORLD   PRODUCTION TEAM Oscar Cardona: Producer/Post-Production/Co-DirectorOscar Cardona is a visual artist and documentarian filmmaker. Oscar has developed projects with a social impact in the arts and received many awards for his works ranging from expositions and exhibitions both in the local and international arena. Among some of the prizes he has won are; Premio Nacional Sin Formato de Fotogarfía del Ministerio de Cultura de Colombia, nominated for Premios India Catalina (Colombian Emmy's), Art exhibitions in Colombia, Brasil, Mexico and the United States. Among his most recent projects Una Cancha Llamada Medellin is an artistic documentary that examines how soccer is a tool of social transformation in the communities of Medellin, Colombia. Felipe Barrientos: Co-Producer/Co-DirectorFelipe was born and raised in Medellin, Colombia. Here he received his educational and family upbringing, he learned the value of family structure and how important it is but he also gained a love for academic, artistic and sport endeavors. In the early years he started his sports career which gave him the discipline for his studies as an engineer, singer and actor.As soon he graduated from the University he left for the United States, like many immigrants, he had a diverse variety of jobs. Fifteen years years later a big dream of his to become an actor in Hollywood productions became a reality, this came after he landed the role 'Charger' in the hit TV show Queen of the South. He was nominated for Best Actor in the Short Film Mortal Dilemma at the Long Island International Film Festival, which also entered competition in the final phase for the Oscars. He has worked in several films and shows in Colombia and Argentina.His passion for learning more behind the scenes action landed him  the role as a producer for Golden Ceiba Productions where they did films such as Blue Family and The Strike. In 2018, along with his friend and colleague Christopher Marquez, they founded 369 Cinema, a company focused on documentaries as well as fictional films with a social and humanistic drive. His first film as a Director and Producer will be El Paracaidista which is now in post-production. Christopher Marquez: Co-Producer/Co-DirectorFrom a very early age Christopher always knew that words can either open doors or create destruction. His father, Roberto, early on inculcated the importance in developing communication skills, something he himself always felt that he was lacking; so he introduced him into the world of great orators and speech masters. This was the beginning to fully realize the power of presentation and delivery of the spoken word. In 2008 when Christopher was still trying to navigate the waters of his purpose in life he discovered acting by chance by doing a small role in a short film at the University of North Texas. Soon after, the bug got him and he dedicated himself to the craft by studying at the New York Film Academy under Maggie Reed and David Triacca. Filled with a new vigor, he joined Golden Ceiba Productions an independent film production company as Vice President, where he got his start in the indie world and later moved on to greener pastures. Since then, he has starred in such films as Habana Instant, The Strike, and co-starred in TV shows such Queen Sugar, Queen of the South, The Suicide Squad, DMZ, Black Lightning, and MacGyver. In 2018, Christopher embarked on his directorial debut documentary and is re-exploring themes of cultural and social significance that he finds close to his heart such as immigration.  SOCIAL MEDIAInstagram: @369cinemaFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/369cinema ADDITIONAL PERK ITEMS INFORMATIONWe have 14 unique protest flag art pieces that were used during real life protests in Mexico.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   ""In our current world of constant shift and change, where the speed of problem-rising is faster than the speed of problem-solving, many things remain unknown and uncertain when we try to look into the future that is both dauthing and unpredictable. We have more questions than the initiatives to answering them, what lies at the bottom of the suffering and grief that we experience? What does human connection mean in a world where physical touch is diminishing and isolated? What is it that we individually seek, driven by our primal desire to belong and to be connected?<br/>    As an international student and a fellow human being, the past eight years of being exposed to multicultural content has challenged me and pushed me to cast more questions than getting answers in search of the width and depth of human conneciton’s puzzle. What does it mean to be human in our current world with regards to the relations we have with others and with ourselves? <br/>    The short film Messenger(s) seeks to explore the transformative nature of human connections and interactions, as well as shedding light on the unspoken reality that every single one of us is coming from a different place with unique stories that we hold within our core, of which is deeply in touch with the vulnerable, honest and powerful essence we each hold and share.

Being on a canoe trip requires team work and a lot of joking around!! Seriously though, when your out in the wilderness for up 10 days with just your food, equipment and fellow campers, you learn about working together for a common goal. It's the perfect metaphor for telling our story about coming of age, overcoming obstacles, Friendship and Family, and, about finding Faith. Thomas Porter is faced with challenges and decisions about life all teenagers face. Crossing The Bonfield-Dickson portage and how he meets a ""challenge"" he's taken on, is the major point in the story, but not the only point. We have this wonderful problem of having more material than we can shoot for a 2hr film! So we have our work cut out for us to make this as we envision it now. When was the last time we had a kids movie with real characters, great story telling with a positive message and fantastic scenery?

We have been working on completing COVID-19 declaration forms for cast and crew to sign, as well as documents that have strict procedures on set. We will be providing our cast and crew with PPE on set, covered in our budget. This is to ensure that everyone can stay safe, have access to face-masks, sanitiser, visors and gloves. It is very important for us to maintain a high standard of health and safety - which we have been working on since day 1 of our production.              www.instagram.com/making.a.killing   www.facebook.com/MAKshortfilm",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>While We Wait</i> tells the story of Jade and her brother, Lanre, trying to rekindle their sibling bond whilst waiting to see if their mother manages to pull through intensive care.</p>
<p>Faced with the dilemma of their mother’s looming death, semi-estranged siblings Jade and Lanre are stuck together in an ICU waiting room in the middle of the night. Despite once being thick as thieves, Lanre and Jade have grown apart massively due to his busy life, his demanding relationship and his inability to come to terms with his sister’s sexual assault. As they pass through the long night, hard truths and memories unfold, and the hope of rekindling their close sibling bond resurfaces.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to donations from our Cast &amp; Crew we have been able to make a very moving short film. Now, to get this piece of art out to as many festivals as possible, we need you!  With your help and financial contributions, we can submit <i>While We Wait</i> to numerous cutting-edge festivals worldwide so many audiences have the opportunity to watch this incredibly important film.</p>
<p>In return for your contribution, you will be the first to know of screenings of the project and on request, will have access to a director's cut screening of the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can count on one hand how many films I’ve watched as an adult that has a brother and sister relationship or even a sibling relationship at its core, meanwhile, the stuff I watched growing up centred around these relationships – Narnia, Mrs Doubtfire, Cheaper by The Dozen, That’s So Raven even Frozen.  It’s important to me as a writer, as a sister to two brothers to show these relationships existing past childhood.</p>
<p><i>While We Wait</i> was produced and filmed in London by a fantastic group of creatives.  We are proud to say that we were able to assemble a Cast &amp; Crew of predominantly Black and Asian descent, as over 75% of our Cast &amp; Crew were BAME.  We are also telling a story with mixed-race Nigerian characters, exploring difficult subject matter, particularly sexual assault in Nigeria, the country in which I grew up.   Records of sexual assault are hard to come by, but a 2019 study found that between the years of 1973 and 2019 – that’s 46 years, there have only been 65 rape convictions in Nigeria, half of which took place after 2015.  Only 2 states out of the 36 have a Sex Offender’s registry, which are extremely hard to come by anyway.  Where I come from, rape is a part of many women’s unspoken histories and even present.  We need to talk about it and we need to raise awareness about it.  It was important for me to do that with <i>While We Wait</i>.</p>
<p>It is so important for us to raise these funds so we can get this film out to as many festivals as possible to not only share a very moving story but to also raise debate and awareness around very important topics.</p>

<h3><i><strong>Story Synopsis</strong></i></h3>
<p>The Goatman is a classic monster mystery intertwined with a family horror drama. What is supposed to be an emotional reunion turns into a night of terror.

<h3>ABOUT OUR FILM</h3>
<p>Welcome to our campaign! We are so thrilled that you are here and have shown interest in 'The Lake Man'. We are very passionate about this film and telling this adventurous story.  We want you to be a part of the process and come along for the ride! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Plot:</h3>
<p>'The Lake Man' takes place in the year 2030, where a black hole looms in the sky over a fictional lake called 'Lake Oyarsa'. An army veteran who suffers from PTSD, James Hartfield, has vivid nightmares of his astrophysicist wife's death and of a mysterious homeless man who has coordinates to a portal created by the black hole's energy. James' wife, Ava, studies the black hole, and a government task force is out to steal her research in order to use the portal's time bending capabilities to manipulate the past. When James learns that these nightmares are actually happening in real time, he sets out to uncover why they involve the Lake Man, who the Lake Man is, and what he wants with the portal. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Director's Statement:</h3>
<p>Greetings ! My name is Joe Simon, and I am the writer and director of 'The Lake Man'. The fact that you are reading this is so exciting. This idea for this film came out of a desire to make to make a film with my friends, and the fact that we are HERE launching this campaign is just awesome.</p>
<p>The Lake Man was an idea that kept floating through my mind throughout 2020, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. I was on the lake with a friend and the idea just kind of hit me. A story about a mysterious man who lives on the lake. But the concept only evolved. I love modern indie sci fi films and I have always wanted to write and direct one! But one that was authentic to me, and the films I love. </p>
<p>Our film has taken inspiration from films such as 'Mud', 'Logan', 'Interstellar, 'Arrival', and so much more! </p>
<p>I feel that this short could be something really special. Even though it will be short in length, it will be jam packed with action, suspense, stunning visual effects, emotion, and excitement. We really believe we have a unique story to tell, and one that will stand out from other shorts.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>​<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We're especially excited for this campaign because we want to partner with supporters who believe in our team, are inspired and intrigued by our story, and who want to see us turn it into a unique and entertaining film. </span></p>
<p>The Lake Man will be filmed at Lake Allatoona, about 30 minutes north of Atlanta, Georgia. Our cast and crew live in and around Atlanta, so our transportation and lodging expenses will be relatively low to non-existent. Our highest costs will be in our wages and hospitality. It's important to us that our cast and crew feel valued, comfortable, and fed.</p>
<p>Given our initial estimated schedule, we're aiming for a total wages expense of $3,000, $1,000 for food and refreshments, and $2,000 for equipment/props/costuming/post-production. A $100 donation, for example, would cover refreshments for one day of filming. A donation of $200 would cover a meal for one day, or the cost of a cast member's wages for one day.  A donation of $500 to $1,000 would pay for a significant portion of our cinematography and lighting equipment costs. </p>
<p>In the unfortunate case that we do not reach our goal in the allotted time for this campaign, we will have to postpone creating The Lake Man until we have the means to give it the attention it needs.</p>
<p>  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to give to our campaign financially, there are other ways you can help! We encourage you to make some noise about The Lake Man on social media and amongst your family and friends. We'd love it if you could share a link to this campaign using the Indiegogo share tools. </p>

<p>Thank you so much for your attention to our campaign! We hope you will consider giving to The Lake Man and helping us create this film. </p>

<p>The story follows a 18-year-old Aurora struggling to find herself after all the pressure coming from her friends, family and the society. Battling with her own mind she struggles to make herself happy. It is easier said than done. She might not be in the middle of every drama but as a bystander she is effected by what others are saying and doing, even though she wouldn't like to be.</p>
<p>This story is told by 31 young filmmakers and film enthusiast. All of us have one goal with this film; we want to tell real stories about life as a teenager in today's society. We want to bring up the real struggles and thoughts young people go through from ages 18-26.</p>
<p>We are making this film to bring awareness about bearings young people go through every day around the world, such as mental health issues and peer pressure. </p>
<p>This film is about <strong>45 </strong>minutes to <strong>60 </strong>minutes long and is made in Finnish but is subtitled in English. </p>
<p>This story is close to our directors and script writers Oona Glans' life, and the idea to create a film with only young filmmakers and film enthusiast who has just gone through those hard years of becoming an ""adult"" came from her.</p>
<p><i>""After graduating from High School and pursuing career in film industry I started following more and more films that showed what life as a youngster is, I noticed how those films didn't show the real thoughts and feelings my friends and I went through. I started to talk about this discovery of mine with my filmmaker friends who all had the same feeling. Then came the idea to tell a story that would show the real world of young people.""</i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHERE WE ARE PLANING TO USE THE MONEY:</h3>
<p>We need this money mainly for the filming equipment. We are planing of buying the equipment so it is cost effective.  Next bigger part of the budget will go to catering.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE REASONS TO SUPPORT THIS FILM:</h3>
<ol>
<li>It's a completely new approach to tell a story about young people and it is something that we feel like has never been done before. This is a film we would want to see ourselves.</li>
<li>This film gives a unique opportunity to youngsters to say things out loud that they haven't been able to say.</li>
<li>Even tough we don't have years of experience, we are new generation with a new approach to film making, without forgetting the traditional ways.</li>
<li>This film gives experience and a chance for young filmmakers to work in a bigger project and gain more experience. This helps these filmmakers to work in future projects.  (We just wanna say that every one of us is doing this voluntarily without getting any money out of this.)</li>
<li>And one of the most important reasons: All the extra money out of this and the unused money from the production, will be donated to charities and different parties that support mental health and prevent exclusion of young people. (The charities will be announced later during the production. We also want to hear from people backing us.)</li>

We have also agreed to cooperate with Helsinki Media Arts Upper Secondary School.

To those of you who have found yourself asking “why didn’t I spend my time with this person more wisely?” or “what could I have done differently?” this is a story to you. This is a story that takes place within the context of suicide, but tackles a feeling that is universal.

The love we experience for those around us is that “forever.” The butterfly motif in our story is a physical representation of that “forever.” It is a symbol of hope. It is a sign that there will be brighter days. It is a sign that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I believe anyone who has experienced loss in their lives, will understand the themes that we are trying to unravel in this film.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616986080/r3lm9zhcedateoraf0cp.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>CHARACTERS </strong></p><p>Josh is a wallflower-type character who doesn’t seem too great at making close friends.

With this goal in mind, we hope to have the animation completed by October, so that post-production will be finished in time for us to submit for most of our top choice Oscar-qualifying festivals. We are shooting for the stars with this project. We think we have the potential to go the distance. It will take the necessary funds to hit these goals in a timely manner. Visual Development complete -- June 2021Animation Complete -- October 2021Post-Production Complete -- December 2021Private Screening -- PENDINGOther Rewards -- November 2021  JOIN OUR COMMUNITYIt takes a village!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I Took A Nap And I Miss You is a student film production; A coming-of-age, drama-comedy mockumentary about a family of three - a mother and two daughters - all operating on what-ifs and varying struggles with intimacy. We are a team feverish with passion but lacking in resources. In full truth, we are dying to make this project a reality and in the best way it could be - the best performances for the best heart, the right things and places for the best energy - but we do not have enough money. Your contribution would mean bringing our dreams closer to us, and hopefully would be something you'd find joy to witness. </p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>With the recent death of her husband Luke, Liz juggles her emotions while navigating through that of her two daughters’ – making sure that they’re okay in the world, and that she’s okay. Liz’s teen daughter Gigi stands at the cusp of a potential romance and attempts to gain revelation about her own ambiguous feelings, unsure if what she's discovered of herself is all it is. Stacy finds companionship within an imaginary boyfriend, Nicky, getting bullied for it, bringing up concern for the family.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>There had been a death in their family, but I would like to challenge the idea of major events in a person’s life affecting a person’s psyche and leaving a permanent mark – is that always the case, is it so A equals to B or is it possible that more trivial things could lead to B? It’s become too automatic to assume in the world we live in today, that certain things are explained by certain events. Stacy has an imaginary boyfriend and is getting bullied for it, but where did it come from, and does it matter? Are things only real if they exist socially? The malfunctions of intimacy are classic motherfuckers in anyone's lives, I think it a challenge to portray it without overemphasizing and with a touch of warmth, just enough of everything to be relatable and human. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where Your Funds Will Go</h3>
<p>The performance and the chemistry between the cast is paramount to the success of our film. The funding will help us in paying each key actor reasonably well to ensure the best acting we can get. </p>
<p>It will also help us to pay for location permit and production design in the right house, to create the unique, quirky yet homely setting for our characters to engage with in this heartwarming story. </p>
<p>The rest of the funding will mostly go into food (to feed our hardworking cast and crew) and transport (we have to transport huge bulky camera, lighting equipments and the crew through rented lorries/big vans).</p>
<p>Any excess of the money donated, should there be, will be used wisely to enhance our collective creative vision on screen. We deeply appreciate EVERY DOLLAR that you donate to us.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>""<strong>bef0re</strong>""  </i>is a 10 min science fiction short film, about two code programmers working under a tech company called ""0"" where they have to run coding tests on a time machine prototype that causes time loops that they suffer the consequences of in real time. The two code programmers and fellow friends <strong>""Rob""</strong> and<strong> ""Aaron""</strong> volunteer to take part in this mission, and it doesn't take long before they realise they've bitten off more than they can chew. The time loop resets after a limited interval; a time frame in which Aaron and Rob have to do their work in, before the interval resets, which causes lapses in the memories of the two characters, where they vaguely remember details of their mission.  Both of them run on different times according to the strength and qualities of their brain synapses and carry a timer device that has a countdown till the interval resets so they can leave ample time to sleep, because being unconscious is the only way to survive a time reset.  Once one of them wakes up, the other one has to carry out a procedure of checking if the other person is stable and run some health checks, after that their job is to remind them of their cause and why they are there in the first place , and then go off to sleep before their time runs out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Team:</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>""bef0re""  </strong></i>consists of a group of people from different backgrounds and unique sensibilities which will hopefully enable us to create magic together:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Producer: <i>Oscar Aitchison </i></strong></p>
<p>""<i>H</i><i>ello i’m Oscar Aitchison. I wanted to get on board with this project because the script really spoke to me as a huge fan of sci-fi. I write plenty of sci-fi related scripts as it is and i thought Arij had really nailed a complex yet achievable narrative with well placed ambition. I can’t wait to start the process and make the incredible story a reality!”</i></p>
<p>2. <strong>Cinematographer: <i>Grayson Moody</i></strong></p>
<p><i>""What I appreciate about cinema is it’s ability to tell simple stories in the most complex of ways. Some of my favourite films are the ones that despite the grand settings, moving score and complex plots, it’s the little messages inside that give the spectacle meaning.

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></h2>
<p>This is a final year University project, and as students we have very limited resources to pull this film off on our own.</p>
<p>1.<strong> Location:</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic hasn't made things easier for us  and we had a cyber attack incident in our University that caused all the computer servers of the university to crash, making it hard for us to film on campus as our film revolves around the characters using a computer and interacting with the interface, because of this we will have to look for locations outside of our University where we will have to pay a daily location fee. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Transport:</strong></p>
<p>We will have to arrange a van to transport the filmmaking equipment from one location to the other, this will cost transportation fee for a van to bring the equipment back and forth for four days of filming. </p>
<p>3. <strong>Catering:</strong> </p>
<p>Fresh food and refreshments are a vital component on a running set, for the crew to function efficiently they need to be able to nourish themselves to keep up with the rough regiment and 10 hour work day, in order to do that we will be hiring a catering service that will be able to provide the cast and crew with nutritious meals. </p>
<p>4. <strong>Cast and Crew fee:</strong></p>
<p>We will be using the services of extremely skilled crew members to bring this film to life, which includes the actors as well as a professional composer, we will have to pay for the actors travel and food expenses as well as pay the composer for his hard work on the score of the film. </p>
<p><strong>5. Visual Effects:</strong></p>
<p>The film requires some special effects work on sequences where the character are asleep and we have to create a sequence in which we showcase an iteration of what people see when they sleep, which is spectrum of colours merging and streaks of colours moving, for this we will have to hire a special effects designer to make that possible. </p>
<p>6. <strong>Time machine Prop: </strong>The time machine prop will be made by the engineering students in our University and funding will be needed to get the appropriate materials required to construct a time machine. </p>
<p>7. <strong>Festival Submission:</strong> We will be submitting the finished film to many film festivals which will require a submission fee. </p>
<h2>What you'll get: </h2>
<p>We have a wide array of perks waiting for the people that claim them, Every bit of your donations will be spent on the film and you will be able to see that on the screen, when the film is done.  The perks are named after iterations which are different layers of coding and are a main aspect and component of the mechanics of our film. </p>
<p>1. <strong>iteration 1:</strong> You will get a signed copy of the script</p>
<p>2. <strong>iteration 2:</strong> You will get two different signed posters of the film. </p>
<p>3. <strong>iteration 3</strong>: You will get a digital version of the film with director's commentary. </p>
<p>4. <strong>iteration 4</strong>: You will get digital album of the soundtracks of the film ranging from electronic to synth music and a cavalcade of other experimental music. </p>
<p>5.<strong> iteration 0</strong> : You will get executive producer credit which will appear at the end of the film. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact:</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Your donation will help us make this unconventional genre film possible,  it will allow us to make a cerebral story and encourage other filmmakers and give them confidence to use this platform to help them to make <strong>""out - of- the box""</strong> stories that would be otherwise challenging for independent filmmakers to kickstart. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h2>
<p>the obvious and prominent challenge is the pandemic that has abrupted our schedule and logistics quite a bit as well as the cyber attack on the network servers of the university has made it hard for us to be authorised to use any computer rooms or locations in the University which propels us to seek out locations in which we will have to pay location fees as well as transport equipment back and forth. We will also follow all the precautionary protocols needed to film in this pandemic which will include checking the temperature of the cast and crew members, wearing masks at all times, spraying and cleaning the equipment with anti bacteria. </p>

While most fans of the era can quote various episodes and talk in depth about character backstory, James' encyclopedic knowledge goes much deeper. He can tell you when and where characters appear with slightly different color shades, when lines were dubbed in, when and where storyboards were different than the final episode, and knows all about unproduced shows and future plans. He lives and breathes it and specifically, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Ever since he was a kid, he's wanted to tell He-Man stories and while he's authored books for Dark Horse detailing every single episode of the beloved cartoon, edited the celebrated fan magazine, cereal:geek, and remains a popular resource for 80s cartoons, his childhood goal has alluded him - until 2017. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622234598/jkgyxxghjczejikyfumr.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Four years ago, James decided he was going to fulfill his dreams and create an unofficial He-Man cartoon that, ideally, would seamlessly fit into the heralded Filmation version of the famed character. The look, the sounds, the voices, the music - It was all going to be like the Filmation series. After 3.5 years of hard work with a handful of collaborators all volunteering their efforts because they shared the same passion as James, the cartoon was completed and ready to showcase at Power-Con - and then came the legal warnings from NBC/Universal, the rights holder for He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. With his childhood dream on the precipice of becoming a reality, James must now choose what he wants to do: does he shelve it and save himself from expensive legal action? Does he find a way around the situation? Does he release it no matter what - because dreams matter more than money? Of course, he has decided to journey forward!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622234616/yudbeztdxjkwmc8awmyx.png"" src=""""/></p><p>While chronicling James' journey to create and release his unofficial cartoon, we will talk to industry insiders, animation aficionados, and cartoon lovers from everywhere about the impact of cartoons, the current state of cartoon culture, Saturday morning, weekday and prime time Cartoons, the rise and fall of Filmation, the impact of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Fan Films and so much more!!!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622234303/oe6fou6kp44smql5cubw.png"" src=""""/></p><p>While the main drive of the film will be James' story including his beginnings, personal life and so forth, it's all being wrapped in a giant discussion about cartoons with some of the most respected and talented people on the planet. So what kind of topics will the film showcase?

He DP'd the last film that Joe and Stephanie produced together called, 'Tin Holiday.' 'Tin' is still in post and should be finished by the time we start production on 'E&amp;H' this summer. He is also a screenwriter and filmmaker. He plans on making Los Angeles his home as production starts on 'E&amp;H' this summer.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">We need a minimum of $55,000! It's a lot of money, but for a film, it is not much. We are working with a bare-bones crew and plan to shoot this film in 12 days. The writers, director, producers and most of the actors are all donating their time for now, they are working on a deferred pay plan, meaning if the film does well upon being released, and we can recoup some funds, then and only then will they get some money for their work. The only folks getting paid are the crew for production, post-production, rental companies, insurance and of course food to feed the cast and crew. The funding will also pay for some wardrobe and props and a dog sitter.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have some really great perks from film merchandise like T-shirts and posters to some astrological readings and hypnotherapy sessions and a week stay at an incredible location in Guatemala. The owner of this property has offered up a room in her AirBnB registered home that is quite popular on their site. She is excited about our project that she offered up her space as a perk. We will feature this perk in a few weeks. :)<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If we don't make our goal, we will probably still go ahead, but it will be on our credit cards and while that isn't the most prudent way to do things, it would be the most efficient as far as getting it done. We are looking to private investors, but so far we have been unable to secure funding.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">This project is different because we are making a film in a very non-traditional way for Hollywood. If this film had made it's way through the Hollywood machine, it would have never made it past the reader. It would never have been cast with these fine actors and our director would never have been given this opportunity and the writers would probably have never had a chance to even get their work produced. Why? Not because it isn't good. It is. It is a fantastic script, but because it isn't a film about cliches and the expected pretty cast of 20 somethings. It is an adult story with adult circumstances, there's no sex, or violence. It is a story of the human condition and connection and family that is being told from a very unique perspective, a different perspective with a traditional indie film vibe.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Your contribution will help us tell this story. And this story should be told if not to give the brilliant female writers and director an opportunity to shine in a male dominated industry. Yes, I am male, but I do believe in shining the light on talent in whatever form that talent takes. This film is worth your contribution. Personally, I am a multi-award-winning producer and director. I do not like talking about myself this way, but I know and understand that awards do mean something. It means someone has approved of your work, you have been vetted. My first film 'Revenge of the Bimbot Zombie Killers' was crowdfunded successfully in 2011 and took Best Feature honors at a Los Angeles film festival. It was picked up for distribution and is now available for streaming and download. 'Bimbots' is a Mel Brooks type B-movie spoof, which screened at Comikaze Expo in 2014 to a very enthusiastic audience. My web series 'Fixing Paco' starring legendary comedian, Paul Rodriguez, has garnered several awards for direction and producing including a Telly Award and two nominations for an Imagen Award in 2013 &amp; 2014. </p>Help us tell the story in 'Edith &amp; Harvey' and be part of our success. We can't do it without you!<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">As producers of lower budget productions, we've always been able to find a way to do things and make it happen. We've learned to be very careful with money and budget wisely to make the money we have designated for specific line items on a film to last, which is why we can make this film for so little. Believe it when we say we could use a whole lot more, and if we do surpass our goal, the folks volunteering of their time will get something for their troubles as it were. So your hard earned money will go to great use!</p>

In essence, she is the perfect fit to tell this story, her director's eye and experience is just what we need.*****THE SCREENWRITERS - GABRIELA LÓPEZ DE DENNIS & SOREL KAIRÉ:Twitter: @TheGabriela & @leroseriak, respectivelyThese two ladies wrote the award-winning 'Fixing Paco' starring Gloria Garayua and Paul Rodriguez and then translated all 9 episodes into Spanish. Both versions of this story have received international attention for the groundbreaking work done on the project. We are so very lucky they happened to write this little script of ours with so much depth and clarity.*****PRODUCER - MELISSA PERL:Deep theater roots drivee this artists soul. Her background as an actor, choreographer, and now producer have provided a thorough understanding of the inner workings of production. She just wrapped art direction on an epic web series spanning 5 decades and producing a short film.*****PRODUCER - MICHAEL PERL:Twitter: @MichaelAlanPerlNo stranger to producing, Michael has produced theater, film and an ambitious science fiction web series.  As an actor, he has been a series regular and guest star actor on several series over the years as well as worked in the theater. His background will provide an immense knowledge base for our production.*****EXECUTIVE PRODUCER - STEPHANIE WIAND:Twitter: @StephanieWiandStephanie has produced several award-winning projects over the eyes with 'Fixing Paco' being the most recent, garnering two Imagen Foundation Award Nominations in 2012 & 2013; People's Telly Silver Winner 2013; 2012 Reel Rasquache Film Festival Best 
Webisode, Fixing Paco; Official Selection, 2013 Reel Rasquache Film 
Festival, Fixing Paco: Changing Lives. Her first feature film as producer, Revenge of the Bimbot Zombie Killers, a B-Movie spoof, took Best Picture honors at the Reel Rasquache Film Festival in 2011. It just got picked up for distribution in the US and Canada and screened to an enthusiastic audience at Comikaze Expo 2014 in Los Angeles.*****PRODUCER - JOE CAMARENO:Twitter: @JoeCamareno
With numerous awards under his belt as a producer and director, and a canon of work spanning from critically-acclaimed theater productions and web series to B-Movie spoofs and in international film shot on two continents, Joe brings a unique perspective to this production. His awards and nominations include: 2006 PARSEC Award, Virgin Falls; 2010 IMAGEN Award, Ylse;
 People's Telly Silver Winner 2013, IMAGEN Awards Nominee 2013, 2012 
Reel Rasquache Film Festival Best Webisode, Fixing Paco; Official 
Selection, 2013 Reel Rasquache Film Festival, Fixing Paco: Changing 
Lives; Best Feature, Reel Rasquache Film Festival 2011, Revenge of the 
Bimbot Zombie Killers.*****OUR DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY - GILES ANDREWS:Hailing from the UK, Giles will be flying in to work on our film. He DP'd the last film that Joe and Stephanie produced together called, 'Tin Holiday.' 'Tin' is still in post and should be finished by the time we start production on 'E&H' this summer. He is also a screenwriter and filmmaker. He plans on making Los Angeles his home as production starts on 'E&H' this summer.
  What We Need & What You Get We need a minimum of $55,000! It's a lot of money, but for a film, it is not much. We are working with a bare-bones crew and plan to shoot this film in 12 days. The writers, director, producers and most of the actors are all donating their time for now, they are working on a deferred pay plan, meaning if the film does well upon being released, and we can recoup some funds, then and only then will they get some money for their work. The only folks getting paid are the crew for production, post-production, rental companies, insurance and of course food to feed the cast and crew. The funding will also pay for some wardrobe and props and a dog sitter.
We have some really great perks from film merchandise like T-shirts and posters to some astrological readings and hypnotherapy sessions and a week stay at an incredible location in Guatemala. The owner of this property has offered up a room in her AirBnB registered home that is quite popular on their site. She is excited about our project that she offered up her space as a perk. We will feature this perk in a few weeks. :)
If we don't make our goal, we will probably still go ahead, but it will be on our credit cards and while that isn't the most prudent way to do things, it would be the most efficient as far as getting it done. We are looking to private investors, but so far we have been unable to secure funding.

  The Impact This project is different because we are making a film in a very non-traditional way for Hollywood. If this film had made it's way through the Hollywood machine, it would have never made it past the reader. It would never have been cast with these fine actors and our director would never have been given this opportunity and the writers would probably have never had a chance to even get their work produced. Why? Not because it isn't good. It is. It is a fantastic script, but because it isn't a film about cliches and the expected pretty cast of 20 somethings. It is an adult story with adult circumstances, there's no sex, or violence. It is a story of the human condition and connection and family that is being told from a very unique perspective, a different perspective with a traditional indie film vibe.
Your contribution will help us tell this story. And this story should be told if not to give the brilliant female writers and director an opportunity to shine in a male dominated industry. Yes, I am male, but I do believe in shining the light on talent in whatever form that talent takes. This film is worth your contribution. Personally, I am a multi-award-winning producer and director. I do not like talking about myself this way, but I know and understand that awards do mean something. It means someone has approved of your work, you have been vetted. My first film 'Revenge of the Bimbot Zombie Killers' was crowdfunded successfully in 2011 and took Best Feature honors at a Los Angeles film festival. It was picked up for distribution and is now available for streaming and download. 'Bimbots' is a Mel Brooks type B-movie spoof, which screened at Comikaze Expo in 2014 to a very enthusiastic audience. My web series 'Fixing Paco' starring legendary comedian, Paul Rodriguez, has garnered several awards for direction and producing including a Telly Award and two nominations for an Imagen Award in 2013 & 2014. Help us tell the story in 'Edith & Harvey' and be part of our success. We can't do it without you!   Risks & Challenges As producers of lower budget productions, we've always been able to find a way to do things and make it happen. We've learned to be very careful with money and budget wisely to make the money we have designated for specific line items on a film to last, which is why we can make this film for so little. Believe it when we say we could use a whole lot more, and if we do surpass our goal, the folks volunteering of their time will get something for their troubles as it were. So your hard earned money will go to great use!

  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute for whatever reason and the story of our film resonates with you, you can help us by sharing our link with your friends and family. You can do this easily by using the Indiegogo share tools on this page. Share on FB, Twitter or email the link. It's easy!
Thanks for reading this tome! :) And I hope you will help us make this awesome film and be part of our success!",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

This makes it difficult to set up scenes just anywhere. It has a steampunk flair and as such we need certain locations that will enhance the drive of not only the visuals but the story as well. Since there are two sides to Capitol City the poor broken down side (The Burrows) and the rich aristocratic side (The Chatham District) we need specific locations to suit both of those needs. Some locations do come with costs such as the Chatham District and with your help we can secure those specific locations and get truly amazing and beautiful shots.<br/>2) Compensation for cast and crew:<br/>We have been very fortunate to have a strong team that shares our passion for this world and project, who have agreed to work within our budget, even if it means taking a pay cut.  However, some of them have specialty skills, live a long distance away or simply need to make a living. Our small budget only goes so far, and expenses such as lodging, and travel reimbursement are going to play a big factor in upcoming episodes since we have talent from all over involved. <br/>3) Wardrobe and props:<br/>This is another area where we have a very specific look that we need to achieve which means we can't just pick out a pair of blue jeans for a character (Though sometimes it would be easier). This world must hold a consistent look through every facet. We have been so lucky with our prop designer to only charge for materials but every weapon, tool, prop and costume piece cannot hold a likeness to anything really contemporary which means the volume of specific items for certain scenes is a large number and all of those items are designed and created specifically for the show. <br/>4) SFX:<br/> There are scenes that require a professional practical, makeup or post production effects to make the scenes look real. This is an area that can not be overlooked, as it will hurt the integrity of the scenes and make the overall product suffer.<br/>5) Food:<br/>Simply put its the fuel that keeps the midnight oil burning. A fed crew is a happy and productive crew and we want a happy and productive crew.<br/>6) Misc:<br/>Too broad of a category? Perhaps but this is what we consider misc. additional hard drive storage, batteries, printing supplies, yada yada yada...<br/></p>

<p>There are always risks and challenges going into production. The great news is there are none involved here. The excellent thing about this project is we are in production and just need help completing it which means by contributing to this it is a guarantee that it will be completed. We have 2 international distribution companies very interested in seeing the finished product as well so we are only asking for help to complete the final leg of the journey (aka production season)! Also, having worked on many different sets with many different budgets, we know how to overcome challenges and obstacles that always appear on even the most organized set and work past them efficiently so we can stay on schedule. <br/>The absolute best thing about this is that you wont have to wait and 
ponder when production will begin, how long before its completed or

production season and we're releasing it online next year! See, no risk. How often do you get to see that?<br/></p>

who are all haunted by a common spirit.
The film begins with eight feature characters receiving a haunted

with antiques. It is a perfect setting for a paranormal thriller. The

staff, a group of eccentrics in their own right.
The guests are joined for dinner by their host Randal McRay, who

Randal explains how a family dispute has resulted in a curse that

What’s unique about our film?


Our film The Castle is a reinvention of the “paranormal thriller” genre. Our producing team is collaborating with
professional Vancouver Island paranormal investigators
that are helping us incorporate documented paranormal
activities into our movie.


The majority of talent in our 100% Canadian production
will be from BC and wherever possible, Greater Victoria.

Taking a unique approach in developing our screenplay,
we are diverging from the way independent film usually
develops a script. Instead of attempting to find or build a
location that serves the needs of the script, we had the
screenplay written specifically to suit our location. The
screenplay was inspired by, developed and written at our
filming location, Craigdarroch Castle. In the long run, this
will save time and money on props and location
management when we begin to shoot.


This feature film will be a brand ambassador for Victoria,
BC. We will proudly ensure that there are recognizable
elements of our community prominently visible in our
movie. We want audiences to exclaim, “Wow! Where is that?”



We have been in contact with some amazing BC talent
and crew, but at this stage, it’s too early to reveal any
names.

The local work force and economy will definitely benefit
from our film production. We will invest back in our
community by using local businesses like hotels,
restaurants, prop supplies, electrical generators, caterers,
tools, car rentals and VFX (special effects) to name a few.
We have developed a solid and long-term relationship
with local filmmakers and businesses, thanks to the great
help and effort of Kathleen Gilbert our Film
Commissioner and the Greater Victoria Chamber of
Commerce.

</div></div>","About the Boxing for Christ documentary
In this documentary we will explore a strong willed, resilient mother, Sonia Ramos (once a heavily respected drug dealer and gang member), whose faith and perseverance led her to give back to the underrepresented youth in San Jacinto, California. The defining moment for Sonia was when her son David (a former 4-time Silver Glove USA Boxing Champion) was facing a 27 year prison sentence. Growing up in a very religious Mexican American home Sonia returned to her faith in God. She prayed like she never prayed before and she made a Promise to God that would revolutionize her life. She Promised to turn her life around and vowed to help wavering children and teens stay off the path of self- destruction through a boxing outreach program, if God would save her son. 
Throughout the programs existence Sonia has been tested in her walk of faith by a diagnosis with a tumor, a corrupt Pastor extorting her programs money, family separation, the loss of her house, cars, employment, and the burden of personally funding the Boxing for Christ program.   Despite Sonia’s arduous journey she remains committed to her promise to save the sons and daughters of her community from the corruption of the streets.

In this film we will hear directly from Sonia, her four children, and from some of her most spectacular boxing students that have had to endure major hardships.

Exciting developments are happening with the short film project Two Keys. Get updates on our website and stay connected on Facebook. (You can also follow us @twokeysmovie on Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest!)


Two keys… Two girls…
One choice to decide their destiny in Jerusalem.
STORYLINE and IMPACTBased on true events, Two Keys is an award-winning short screenplay that offers a strong message of hope to young people in seemingly impossible situations. Whether it's the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Ferguson, Baltimore or Charleston, Two Keys speaks to young people about the power of a life lived in faith. Your life matters. Your faith can make a difference.
It's about two teenage girls - one Israeli and one Palestinian - whose worlds collide as they struggle to make their lives count in the conflict of Jerusalem.
Adi is a Jewish girl in Jerusalem, soon to be drafted into the Israeli Defense Force.
She’s on
a mission to see if her faith can make a difference in
the Israeli – Palestinian conflict before she puts on the  battle gear.  Etaaf lives in a neglected
Palestinian refugee camp, separated from Jerusalem by the cement barrier wall designed to stop suicide bombers from
entering the city. She’s seen friends and family suffer and die in this
conflict and she’s determined to do
whatever it takes to see justice and affect change.

A suicide bomb attack
throws the two girls together and they’re forced to make a decision that ultimately
determines their destiny in Jerusalem.


Two Keys brings
hope to today’s generation. Two Keys stirs faith that even in the midst of impossible situations,your life matters.



BUDGET and STRATEGYThe production budget for the short film Two Keys is $75,000.  Your contribution towards this goal helps us shoot establishing
shots and exteriors on location in Israel. We’ll shoot the rest of the film in
Kansas City, which opens up opportunities for you to be involved and possibly get
a chance to be in the film!


The plan is to shoot the film this summer and have it ready
for release by September. The strategy is to qualify Two Keys for the
Short Film Category of the Academy Awards.


Gaining this platform in Hollywood exponentially increases
the influence of Two Keys and its
message. 
There is a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict and your life counts no matter the impossibility of what you are
facing.

<div>
<p>""Orizuru"" means Origami Crane.  It is said that when you have folded a thousand Origami Cranes, then your wish will come true.  The once-athletic Sadako set out to fold a thousand cranes at her hospital bed, so that she may again compete on the tracks.  In her story told by Eleanor Coerr, the leukemia caused by her radiation exposure from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb as a toddler had cut her dream short.  Her legacy, however, lives on and continues to inspire those who work to create a peaceful world for our children.  Seventy years after the end of World War II and the atomic bomb, Sadako and her thousand cranes remain among the most widely recognized symbol of peace and reconciliation, which has come to be embraced by the people, not just from the United States and Japan, but the World over.   This short film shines the light on Sadako's family and the people from both sides of the Pacific, who took down cultural and historical barriers, both big and small, through their hard work and courage.  The story is told from the perspective of a Japanese school boy, who struggles to fit into the American classroom.  Inspired by a class reading of Coerr's book, ""Sadako"", and with the help of an American WWII veteran, the boy finds courage to reach out to his classmates.  </p>

<p>Producer Miyuki Sohara's children learned this story from school in LA.<br/>She researched an original story, then she found a book written by Sadako's real brother in Japanese.</p>

<p>このプロジェクトを始めたきっかけは、アメリカの小学生である私の息子と娘がエレノア　コアさんの「Sadako and The Thousand Paper Cranes(邦題：サダコと千羽鶴）」という折鶴のお話を2年生の時に学校の授業で学んだことがきっかけでした。</p>
<p>「禎子の千羽鶴」は世界30か国以上で翻訳され読み続けられていると言われています。また、ヨーロッパでは教科書の中で、アメリカでは副読本として学校の授業で取り上げられているそうです。<br/></p>
<p>この本の内容は広島で被爆して白血病で12歳の短い生涯を終えた「佐々木禎子さんの千羽鶴」のお話ですが、佐々木禎子さんについて更に深くリサーチを進めていく過程で、禎子さんの実の兄　佐々木　雅弘さんが書かれた「禎子の千羽鶴」が最近日本語で出版されていることも知りました。</p>
<p></p>
<p>このお兄様の本を通し私達は「普段何気なく普通に平和に暮らしていけることの感謝の気持ち」や「命の大切さ」「想いやりの心」「家族愛」「友情」などを深く学びました。</p>

<h3><b><b>Sadako's  Legacy is still alive today.  </b></b></h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">One day, Miyuki Sohara found a book ""Yononaka e no tobira"" written by Kazuko Miyamoto which introduces Sadako's crane as a symbol of peace. The book reminded Miyuki of the grassroots 311 Tsunami Orizuru Project involving her Children's school community in Los Angeles.  The donation of over </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">$2500 in Cash and sent to an American Children Cloth Company who exchanged to new children clothes and sent to Japan.</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> 2,500 origami cranes were matched by a US Apparels Company with the same number of childrens clothes for the Tsunami victims.  The practice of making a thousand origami cranes as a gesture of support to those in need was popularized worldwide by the story of Sadako.  It is thus the legacy of Sadako continues to inspire not only those who are remembering WWII, but has become a tool to encourage those suffering hardships in the present time.  </span><br/>

<h4>禎子さんの生き様を伝え、癒しや思いやりの心、命の大切さを伝えたい</h4>
<p>この様な状況を踏まえ、自分の子供達への教育の為にも、自分自身も一緒に学んでいくべき課題であり、また一方で私の様にアメリカに住む者が、アメリカの子供達や、先生方へ「もう過去の様な出来事が2度と起こらないように。」ということで正しい歴史を伝えていかなければならないと思う次第でした。</p>
<p>又、禎子さんの鶴が平和のシンボルとしてご紹介されている源　和子さん著書の「世の中の扉ー奇跡は翼に乗って」を読み終えて、ふと311の震災の時に息子の学校で日本人ファミリーが中心となりアメリカ人と一緒に「千羽鶴プロジェクト」を行い寄付金を集め、鶴を子供服に交換したりして日本への支援活動をしたことを思い出し、折鶴を通して皆の心が平和を祈って一つに繋がったのを思い出しました。</p>

<p></p>
<p>This concept connected our team members to make this film.<br/>In this film, we will reference one of the episodes from the source's book. We want to convey to the children the following message message; in conflict, blame and hate only leads to more, but, kind gestures and reconciliation opens the way to healing and peace. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2010, Sadako's older brother, Mr Masahiro Sasaki met Mr Clifton Truman Daniel, the oldest grandson of President Truman in New York, and showed him one of the tiny origami cranes made by Sadako.  Sasaki's outreach was reciprocated by Daniel with his historic visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial ceremony in 2012.  This symbolic event garnered significant interest Worldwide and inspired many to take action towards cooperation and reconciliation.   </p>
<p>Once completed, we will work to have this film be seen by as many children as possible, starting with schools in the U.S. and Japan, then to audiences around the world.  Please donate generously for the production and distribution of this film, this is your chance to take action and be involved in spreading of Sadako's legacy of outreach and reconciliation.  </p>
<p>This film is based on the true story about former president's grandchildren etc.<br/></p>

<p>私たちの作品では、源さんの著書の中から一つのエピソードを参考にさせていただき、これからの時代を生きていく子供達へ、過去の歴史を「恨む」「憎む」というのではなく、サダコさんが残してくれた平和の祈りの鶴やそのお話しを通して、「癒し」「想いやりの心」「命の大切さ」「友情」を伝えていきたいと思っています。</p>
<p>アメリカの元大統領のお孫さん等も関わった実話のお話しを基にしています。きっと全国のアメリカの学校、図書館などに保管され時代を超えて視聴される貴重な映画となることでしょう。このプロジェクトに参加して皆様のニックネームをこの映画のプロジェクトに一緒に刻みませんか？ どうか応援よろしくお願いします。</p>

<p></p>
<p> Yuriko works as a Japanese language teacher. One day, one of her American students Chloe asks Yuriko for help making an origami crane for her grandfather Mr.Richard Bruner. Yuriko brings along Satoshi, putting him to the task of teaching the elderly man, who has turned out to be a WWII veteran and a Pearl Harbor survivor.  Mr. Richard Bruner is very appreciative of Satoshi's instruction, and to his own surprise, Satoshi enjoys interacting with the old man.  Mr. Richard Bruner senses Satoshi has not been able to let his guard down since arriving in this country, and feels he must help this young boy feel more at home.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Mr. Richard Bruner is working on an origami crane to dedicate at a peace ceremony in Hawaii.  On a lark, the old man suggests both Satoshi and Yuriko to accompany him at the ceremony to interpret for him.  He jokes Satoshi might feel a little easier if he gets to go back half-way.  Yuriko tries to politely decline, but one more look at her son getting along with Mr. Richards makes her consider the old man's suggestion.  </p>
<p>In Hawaii, Mr. Richards speaks of a 60-year old ""Orizuru"" they will be seeing at the ceremony.  Yuriko and Satoshi are both in the dark about the significance of such an artifact.  </p>
<p>Who is Mr. Richards?  What is the relationship between him and Japanese ""Friends""?</p>
<p>On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, ""The One Paper Crane"" flies all over the world with hopes for peace.</p>

""Orizuru"" means Origami Crane.  It is said that when you have folded a thousand Origami Cranes, then your wish will come true.  The once-athletic Sadako set out to fold a thousand cranes at her hospital bed, so that she may again compete on the tracks.  In her story told by Eleanor Coerr, the leukemia caused by her radiation exposure from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb as a toddler had cut her dream short.  Her legacy, however, lives on and continues to inspire those who work to create a peaceful world for our children.  Seventy years after the end of World War II and the atomic bomb, Sadako and her thousand cranes remain among the most widely recognized symbol of peace and reconciliation, which has come to be embraced by the people, not just from the United States and Japan, but the World over.   This short film shines the light on Sadako's family and the people from both sides of the Pacific, who took down cultural and historical barriers, both big and small, through their hard work and courage.  The story is told from the perspective of a Japanese school boy, who struggles to fit into the American classroom.  Inspired by a class reading of Coerr's book, ""Sadako"", and with the help of an American WWII veteran, the boy finds courage to reach out to his classmates.  
人種や国境を超え「平和な世界と未来への心」を繋いでくれた「折鶴」の実話を基に、短編映画を通して子供の目線で「相手を理解する事」「想いやりの心」「命の大切さ」「友情」などのメッセージを世界の子供達へ伝えたい。
はじめまして。曽原三友紀と申します。Sakura Production USAにて映画のプロデューサー＆監督を務めております。今年は戦後70周年。戦争体験者の方も少なくなっていく中、毎日何不自由なく平和に暮らしていける感謝の気持ちや命の大切さなどをあらためて子供達と一緒に学び考えていきたいと思い、今回日米の友人たちと共に短編映画「折鶴」のプロジェクトを立ち上げました。


　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　         
Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes is a non-fiction children's book written by American author Eleanor Coerr and published in 1977.

The book has been translated to many languages and published in many places, to be used for peace education programs in primary schools.
Producer Miyuki Sohara's children learned this story from school in LA.She researched an original story, then she found a book written by Sadako's real brother in Japanese.
Miyuki Sohara and her children learned about peace, Sadako's Spirit and friendship from this book.
広島で被爆し亡くなった、佐々木禎子さんを描いた本との出会い

このプロジェクトを始めたきっかけは、アメリカの小学生である私の息子と娘がエレノア　コアさんの「Sadako and The Thousand Paper Cranes(邦題：サダコと千羽鶴）」という折鶴のお話を2年生の時に学校の授業で学んだことがきっかけでした。
「禎子の千羽鶴」は世界30か国以上で翻訳され読み続けられていると言われています。また、ヨーロッパでは教科書の中で、アメリカでは副読本として学校の授業で取り上げられているそうです。
この本の内容は広島で被爆して白血病で12歳の短い生涯を終えた「佐々木禎子さんの千羽鶴」のお話ですが、佐々木禎子さんについて更に深くリサーチを進めていく過程で、禎子さんの実の兄　佐々木　雅弘さんが書かれた「禎子の千羽鶴」が最近日本語で出版されていることも知りました。

このお兄様の本を通し私達は「普段何気なく普通に平和に暮らしていけることの感謝の気持ち」や「命の大切さ」「想いやりの心」「家族愛」「友情」などを深く学びました。

Sadako's  Legacy is still alive today.  

One day, Miyuki Sohara found a book ""Yononaka e no tobira"" written by Kazuko Miyamoto which introduces Sadako's crane as a symbol of peace. The book reminded Miyuki of the grassroots 311 Tsunami Orizuru Project involving her Children's school community in Los Angeles.  The donation of over $2500 in Cash and sent to an American Children Cloth Company who exchanged to new children clothes and sent to Japan. 2,500 origami cranes were matched by a US Apparels Company with the same number of childrens clothes for the Tsunami victims.  The practice of making a thousand origami cranes as a gesture of support to those in need was popularized worldwide by the story of Sadako.  It is thus the legacy of Sadako continues to inspire not only those who are remembering WWII, but has become a tool to encourage those suffering hardships in the present time.  



禎子さんの生き様を伝え、癒しや思いやりの心、命の大切さを伝えたい
この様な状況を踏まえ、自分の子供達への教育の為にも、自分自身も一緒に学んでいくべき課題であり、また一方で私の様にアメリカに住む者が、アメリカの子供達や、先生方へ「もう過去の様な出来事が2度と起こらないように。」ということで正しい歴史を伝えていかなければならないと思う次第でした。
又、禎子さんの鶴が平和のシンボルとしてご紹介されている源　和子さん著書の「世の中の扉ー奇跡は翼に乗って」を読み終えて、ふと311の震災の時に息子の学校で日本人ファミリーが中心となりアメリカ人と一緒に「千羽鶴プロジェクト」を行い寄付金を集め、鶴を子供服に交換したりして日本への支援活動をしたことを思い出し、折鶴を通して皆の心が平和を祈って一つに繋がったのを思い出しました。


""Peaceful world and the future that paper cranes connect the mind beyond race and border.""

This concept connected our team members to make this film.In this film, we will reference one of the episodes from the source's book. We want to convey to the children the following message message; in conflict, blame and hate only leads to more, but, kind gestures and reconciliation opens the way to healing and peace. 

In 2010, Sadako's older brother, Mr Masahiro Sasaki met Mr Clifton Truman Daniel, the oldest grandson of President Truman in New York, and showed him one of the tiny origami cranes made by Sadako.  Sasaki's outreach was reciprocated by Daniel with his historic visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial ceremony in 2012.  This symbolic event garnered significant interest Worldwide and inspired many to take action towards cooperation and reconciliation.   
Once completed, we will work to have this film be seen by as many children as possible, starting with schools in the U.S. and Japan, then to audiences around the world.  Please donate generously for the production and distribution of this film, this is your chance to take action and be involved in spreading of Sadako's legacy of outreach and reconciliation.  
This film is based on the true story about former president's grandchildren etc.

「折鶴が人種や国境を超えた心を繋ぐ平和な世界と未来」これが今回の映画製作へと私たちのチームメンバーの心を繋いだのでした。
私たちの作品では、源さんの著書の中から一つのエピソードを参考にさせていただき、これからの時代を生きていく子供達へ、過去の歴史を「恨む」「憎む」というのではなく、サダコさんが残してくれた平和の祈りの鶴やそのお話しを通して、「癒し」「想いやりの心」「命の大切さ」「友情」を伝えていきたいと思っています。
アメリカの元大統領のお孫さん等も関わった実話のお話しを基にしています。きっと全国のアメリカの学校、図書館などに保管され時代を超えて視聴される貴重な映画となることでしょう。このプロジェクトに参加して皆様のニックネームをこの映画のプロジェクトに一緒に刻みませんか？ どうか応援よろしくお願いします。

SYNOPSISA ten year old Japanese boy has just moved to Los Angeles, but he has difficulties fitting in at school.  A reading of the book, ""Sadako"", in his class touches the hearts of his classmates, but it is far from enough to instantly make friends for him.  His final lesson comes through a chance encounter with a veteran, a Pearl Harbor survivor, who invites the boy to join him on his trip to the International Peace Day Ceremony aboard the USS Arizona.  As the boy comes face to face with the history of war and reconciliation, he finds courage to actively reach out to his classmates at his new school. 

THE STORY



 Yuriko works as a Japanese language teacher. One day, one of her American students Chloe asks Yuriko for help making an origami crane for her grandfather Mr.Richard Bruner. Yuriko brings along Satoshi, putting him to the task of teaching the elderly man, who has turned out to be a WWII veteran and a Pearl Harbor survivor.  Mr. Richard Bruner is very appreciative of Satoshi's instruction, and to his own surprise, Satoshi enjoys interacting with the old man.  Mr. Richard Bruner senses Satoshi has not been able to let his guard down since arriving in this country, and feels he must help this young boy feel more at home.  


Mr. Richard Bruner is working on an origami crane to dedicate at a peace ceremony in Hawaii.  On a lark, the old man suggests both Satoshi and Yuriko to accompany him at the ceremony to interpret for him.  He jokes Satoshi might feel a little easier if he gets to go back half-way.  Yuriko tries to politely decline, but one more look at her son getting along with Mr. Richards makes her consider the old man's suggestion.  
In Hawaii, Mr. Richards speaks of a 60-year old ""Orizuru"" they will be seeing at the ceremony.  Yuriko and Satoshi are both in the dark about the significance of such an artifact.  
Who is Mr. Richards?  What is the relationship between him and Japanese ""Friends""?
On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, ""The One Paper Crane"" flies all over the world with hopes for peace.

<p>  It is our desire to give our cast an IMDB credit, give our film exposure in festivals, pay for music rights and catering.

I believe in small independent film makers who do not have the backing to tells stories that blockbusters will never make and therefore will never be told. Every penny will be spent wisely and for the benefit of the film and all involved.

<span>William Samson <br/>I like making films.  I make all sorts of movies in all sorts of genres (Horror, Comedy, Drama, Science Fiction, Dance.) under my company name of Samson Video Productions.  Some of my films have picked up awards.  A couple that I am particularly pleased about are Susan Sutton’s “Best Actress” in “What have you Done?”  And Seylan Baxter’s “Best Music” in “Nancy” both at the Raptors Scottish Short Film Festival.  A couple of my other films have even been BAFTA nominated.  <br/>What I do like when I am making a movie is good acting and I have been fortunate in having been able to work with some really great acting talent during my career.  In the films I make, the emphasis is always on the performers and the acting, which is why I want to make “Weekend in Girvan”.  <br/>As I mentioned in the video on this page, I have been able to work with some excellent actresses in the past few years and I have also had the pleasure of watching Isabella’s stage plays.  I do like her writing.  I am not a fan of inequality and there has been much ongoing discussion about there not being enough decent parts for women to play in film.  So I thought, “Can I put at least some of these good actresses together with a script written by Isabella?” <br/>The answer is “Yes!”  The script of “Weekend in Girvan” has those good roles in it for women; it is a good mix of drama and comedy and it now needs to be made.  Once made, our aim is to submit the film to festivals such as Rain Dance and Sundance and to those festivals which are more geared toward women in film like the Female Eye Festival. <br/>We have the experience, we have the script and we have some ladies with tremendous acting skills who I’m sure you will want to see on screen, so any money donated will not be wasted.  All we need now is your support and perhaps you too will want to have your own Weekend in Girvan.</span><p></p>
