<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Section 16 is about a teenage girl who gets victimized by the human trafficking industry. The book chronicles the thoughts, experiences, and emotions that go through her mind as her life gets upended by a series of unexpected turns.<br/><br/>My name is Sneha Nadella and I am the author of Section 16. I wrote this book because human trafficking is becoming increasingly prevalent and it’s important to realize how close to home it can hit for many of us.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the web-based nature of human trafficking and how its targeting tactics work. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to stop being just a passive listener, and instead take action and stimulate societal change.<br/><br/>Estelle is a 16-year-old girl leading a complicated home life in a tiny suburb at the west edge of New York State. As a fairly introverted girl who strays away from socializing, Estelle finds herself sticking next to her sister and sole confidante, Hazel. Running away from home and leaving Hazel is a huge deal for Estelle - that decision continues to follow her throughout the rest of her journey - but she feels that it is the right thing to do. Upon arriving at her family friend’s home, she has a great feeling as she immediately begins school and makes friends, but just as she's getting comfortable, she finds herself a victim of human trafficking. She's forced to push out of her comfort zone and build confidence that, unknowingly, resided in Hazel ever since her childhood. Facing that inner turmoil along with the trauma she experiences at the trafficking site are simultaneously Estelle's largest obstacles and strongest growth opportunities.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you strive to see social change and would like to gain an insider’s view to one of the many ways trafficking occurs.<br/><br/><i>Section 16</i> speaks to those who have reached the stage where they need to become more aware of some of society’s harsh realities, and to those who want to view courage and decision-making in a new light.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Section 16</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I make sure I am aware and safe, as well as others? How can I help more people understand when they are at risk of being trafficked?</li>
<li>How has human trafficking become the billion-dollar industry that it is?</li>
<li>What can I do to help end human trafficking?</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as personal questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">How do I know if I am trusting the right people or person?</span></li>
<li>What’s the worst possible thing that could happen the next time I take a chance on something? Will it really be that bad, or will it force me to pick myself up with thicker skin next time?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the steps we can take towards making a change and why this change is so important will benefit not only current and potential victims, but society as a whole.</p>

<p>Inner Compass cards point out a new way of self-reflection and personal growth.<br/>The 49 cards guide you on a daily basis or whenever you need a question to be answered on a specific situation in your life. Anyone can use them, easily and effortlessly.</p>
<p><b>How?</b></p>
<p>Most people go through life distracted, having lost touch with what they really, really want out of life. Over time, confused by the constant demands and expectations around them, they have forgotten their potential.</p>
<p>The Inner Compass cards ask you questions to wake you up to the opportunities you’ve been missing out while you were sleepwalking through life.</p>
<p><i>What amazing person can you meet tomorrow if only you open your eyes and look up?</i></p>
<p><i>How would others respond differently when you speak from a place of compassion?</i></p>
<p><i>What unique choices would your authentic self make?</i></p>
<p>How would your life change when you start following your inner compass?</p>

<p><br/><b>What are these Inner Compass cards?</b></p>
<p>The cards share profound universal wisdom and symbolism on a daily basis to guide your personal growth and awakening. The cards guide your perception, and by exploring the different themes you will discover the world as your playground. <br/><br/>The deck consist of 49 carefully designed cards and an accompanying booklet to guide you on your journey of self-discovery. </p>
<p>Each card is printed on high quality, sustainable paper and contains a single, focused word and image with many layers of symbolism and meaning for your subconscious to unpack. </p>
<p>To go deeper into yourself you can learn more about each card in the booklet we have provided for you. The booklet also contains an introduction and a clear user manual so there’s no confusion whatsoever.</p>
<p>Like much of modern life, this entire project is eclectic in nature. Inspiration was found in sources ranging from <b>philosophy, science, psychology and the natural world, to ancient wisdom from all ages, such as the Mayan culture, Taoism, Buddhism, and the I Ching. </b><br/><br/>By arranging and categorizing these sources along a specific algorithm, one card contains <b>many levels of depth and interconnectedness</b>. All for you to explore during many years to come!</p>

<p><br/><b>How to use the deck</b></p>
<p>Some people like to use the deck every morning for a specific card to guide their day. Others might pick a card periodically, <b>to shed light on an urgent issue or a question</b> they might have. </p>
<p>Sometimes you just want to know if you are heading the right way. At other times, you might need help to find a way out. Maybe you just want to leave it open, letting any associations come freely upon drawing a card.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive, after shuffling the deck with your focus and intention, just blindly pick one or more cards. Your intuition will guide you <b>to find new patterns of meaning.</b> It is impossible to choose the wrong card: the right one will always present itself!</p>

<p><br/>The cards offer a precious way out of our scattered monkey minds. This is not the territory of any rational, logical, analytical brain. Rather, the ability to think intuitively and associatively takes over. And there is so much needed clarity in that!</p>
<p>By letting these archetypical motives <b>prime your subconsciousness</b> you will learn the potential your inner compass can have.</p>
<p>In time, should you want more information about a card and what it represents, you can read its accompanying text in the booklet. Here you will unravel the deeper layers of every card, all to guide your next steps on your personal journey.</p>
<p>As you understand now, anyone can do this. Easily. Effortlessly. Insightful. And fun!</p>

<p>Besides,<b> I strongly believe in a <i>proactive</i> start of the day</b>, instead of waking up and directly <i>reacting</i> on things that do not belong to you essentially.</p>
<p>Most of our known inspiring leaders, sages and thinkers choose consciously to start every day with awareness from within, without being distracted by messages from the outside world.</p>

<p><br/><b>The process so far</b></p>
<p>The idea of creating this transformational tool came the moment I realized how the daily use of spiritual 'oracle cards' <b>had managed to change my life fundamentally and positively.</b> By drawing a card every morning after (or instead of) meditation, <b>I kept my attention on my own life</b>, and became aware of the parts that were serving me and those that were holding me back. Soon, I wanted to share this with all my friends, but the decks available were so... let's say esoteric. It felt like the time had come for a deck with a completely new design, style, images and another tone of voice. So I started gathering themes and before I even noticed, I was categorizing the material and writing texts about each card. And getting very, very inspired and enthusiastic!</p>
<p>From then the project grew like a seed grows into a tree: organically. </p>
<p>The topics and the writing came by themselves. Only when I felt the moment was right did I act to follow my guts, and one day I connected with the perfect designer. Together we did a huge research project to come to the best look, feel, and depth for the deck. It started off with many ideas and collages. After a while it was like she could hop into my head and just knew what needed to be done in terms of visuals. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we explored deeply what would and would not work in terms of material, print and themes. And we came to many, many layers for each card, making sure that the Inner Compass Cards always grow with you. Even after using them for the next ten years, you will still find new levels, insights and interconnectedness.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Last November, I self-published my first devotional book, <i>Nobody Left Out: Jesus Meets the Messes</i>. I learned a ton about the self-publishing business! (Including the financial costs associated with it.) This year, I have a goal to self-publish two more books, and I'd like to get the first one out by Easter. The content is already written. Now I just need some help getting it in book form!<br/><br/><i>Nobody Left Out: Jesus &amp; the Way of Sorrows</i> is a brief journey through the Stations of the Cross. The Stations of the Cross is a devotional exercise practiced across many Christian traditions. It follows Jesus' journey to the cross, beginning with Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane and ending with his body being placed in the tomb. There are 14 stops, or stations, along this ""Way of Sorrows."" (There are two versions of the Stations of the Cross—Traditional and Scriptural. My book follows the Scriptural version, which means all 14 stations are rooted in events found in scripture.) The book also explains some of the significance behind this practice and why reflecting on suffering can be helpful.<br/><br/>The goal of all my books is to help people spend time with Jesus and get to know him a little better. With this book, I want to give readers the space to reflect on the sorrowful journey Jesus made to the cross. It's not pretty to read about suffering, but I believe each station is marked with hope. We know that the Way of Sorrows ends with the celebration of Easter morning and the empty tomb. And when we spend time with Jesus on this sorrowful road, we get a deeper understanding that he really doesn't want anyone left out! <br/><br/>The other important thing to mention about this book is that it will be a ""permafree"" book. This means the digital/Kindle version will be free. The paperback version will be priced as low as Amazon will allow me to go based on printing costs (probably $5.99 or less). I want this book to introduce people to my writing and the <i>Nobody Left Out</i> series. If they enjoy it, they can opt-in to my email list or pick up the other books in the series.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Self-publishing provides me with an incredible opportunity to get my ideas out to other people. But there are costs associated with producing a professional-looking book. I am seeking to raise $2,000 to cover these costs. 100% of these funds will go towards the book. With these funds, I'll be able to get:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A professionally designed cover.</span></li>
<li><font>A professionally-designed interior for the paperback version.</font></li>
<li><font>Clean, easy-to-read formatting for the Kindle version that can be downloaded on an iPhone, iPad, or Kindle device.</font></li>
<li><font>An ""interactive"" PDF file of the book (meaning all links are active). Every now and then I come across someone on Facebook who wants my book but doesn't have the money to purchase it. I happily send them the PDF version for free.</font></li>
<li>.MOBI, and .EPUB files ready to upload to Amazon and other places.</li>
<li>Graphic images to use on social media.</li>
<li>Editing services. ​</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My passion is to help people know they matter to Jesus. I believe this is something both non-Christians and Christians need to know. I want non-Christians to get a glimpse of who Jesus is firsthand—the things he did and the words he spoke. I want them to see his love for the messy, the broken, the weak, and the vulnerable. And for those of us who are Jesus followers, it can be easy to get discouraged and forget how loved we are. We need that same message of grace. We need it for ourselves and for the people God has called us to love. People who may look a lot different from us. People we might not even like! :) We need to be reminded that Jesus came so that nobody would get left out. </p>
<p>One day Jesus was eating dinner with a bunch of messy people. The religious elite got annoyed with Jesus and asked why he was dining with such ""scum."" Jesus responded by saying, ""Healthy people don’t need a doctor—sick people do"" (Matthew 9:12, NLT). This has become a guiding verse for my books. I'm a mess! I need Jesus. This is why I started the <i>Nobody Left Out</i> series, and I have ideas for lots of books!</p>
<p>I've committed to always making my books affordable so they can get into as many hands as possible. If someone wants a book and can't pay for it, I give them a free copy. My long-term goal is to write these books full-time, but I'm not there yet. Your contribution will help me release this latest book in a cost-neutral way.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Last November, I self-published my first devotional book, Nobody Left Out: Jesus Meets the Messes. I learned a ton about the self-publishing business! (Including the financial costs associated with it.) This year, I have a goal to self-publish two more books, and I'd like to get the first one out by Easter. The content is already written. Now I just need some help getting it in book form!Nobody Left Out: Jesus & the Way of Sorrows is a brief journey through the Stations of the Cross. The Stations of the Cross is a devotional exercise practiced across many Christian traditions. It follows Jesus' journey to the cross, beginning with Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane and ending with his body being placed in the tomb. There are 14 stops, or stations, along this ""Way of Sorrows."" (There are two versions of the Stations of the Cross—Traditional and Scriptural. My book follows the Scriptural version, which means all 14 stations are rooted in events found in scripture.) The book also explains some of the significance behind this practice and why reflecting on suffering can be helpful.The goal of all my books is to help people spend time with Jesus and get to know him a little better. With this book, I want to give readers the space to reflect on the sorrowful journey Jesus made to the cross. It's not pretty to read about suffering, but I believe each station is marked with hope. We know that the Way of Sorrows ends with the celebration of Easter morning and the empty tomb. And when we spend time with Jesus on this sorrowful road, we get a deeper understanding that he really doesn't want anyone left out! The other important thing to mention about this book is that it will be a ""permafree"" book. This means the digital/Kindle version will be free. The paperback version will be priced as low as Amazon will allow me to go based on printing costs (probably $5.99 or less). I want this book to introduce people to my writing and the Nobody Left Out series. If they enjoy it, they can opt-in to my email list or pick up the other books in the series.
 

What I Need & What You Get
Self-publishing provides me with an incredible opportunity to get my ideas out to other people. But there are costs associated with producing a professional-looking book. I am seeking to raise $2,000 to cover these costs. 100% of these funds will go towards the book. With these funds, I'll be able to get:

A professionally designed cover.
A professionally-designed interior for the paperback version.
Clean, easy-to-read formatting for the Kindle version that can be downloaded on an iPhone, iPad, or Kindle device.
An ""interactive"" PDF file of the book (meaning all links are active). Every now and then I come across someone on Facebook who wants my book but doesn't have the money to purchase it. I happily send them the PDF version for free.
.MOBI, and .EPUB files ready to upload to Amazon and other places.
Graphic images to use on social media.
Editing services. ​

<p>I met Noach Braun (and his amazing wife Orna) who taught me about the amazing work he was doing to provide guide dogs for blind Israelis.  He is truly one of a kind. When I visited the centre it was just a series of caravans on a tiny property. Today through the amazing work of Noach and his team, the centre is a truly phenomenal place and a testament to his work.</p>
<p>As a result of the article I wrote and how impressed I was by his work, I decided to become a ‘puppy walker’ – I would raise a puppy for 12 months and return it to the centre to be trained to work with a blind person.</p>
<p>Bridget was born on Jan 30 1997 and came to my home in March that year. She was an amazing puppy. At the end of the year when I returned her to the centre, she “flunked out” of the training programme (it happens!), and I was asked if I wanted to keep her. Of course!</p>
<p>She stayed with me until she passed away on August 30, 2010 from inoperable bone cancer in her pelvis. She was 13 and a half – and had lived on two continents (I moved to Los Angeles with her in 2005). She loved people, food, swimming in the ocean and was known and loved by many. She even appeared in a production of the musical “Annie.”</p>
<p>Even though Bridget flunked out I’ve always considered her a roving ambassador for the Israel Guide Dog Centre and she was loved and adored by so many. I contacted Noach when she passed away this week and he remembered her and me well.</p>
<p>I will be back in Israel in two weeks, where I will return to visit Noach at the centre and where I plan on making a donation in Bridget’s honour. It takes $500 to sponsor a puppy for its first year. As a puppy walker, all Bridget’s needs were met by the centre for that year. Her vet bills were paid, her food, bowls, leash etc. provided. When I was able to keep her, the centre spayed her at no cost to me.</p>
<p>I want to raise $500 in Bridget’s honour so that the centre can provide all the dog’s needs for another “puppy walker” family.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the centre and what the puppy sponsor money goes towards here: <a href=""http://israelguidedog.org/sponsor-a-puppy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://israelguidedog.org/sponsor-a-puppy/</a></p>

<p>I know that Bridget would appreciate this tribute in her name and that she left this earth knowing she was helping other dogs to fulfill their destiny through The Israel Guide Dog Centre for the Blind.</p>
<p>When Bridget was taken to the orthopedic surgeon where she was diagnosed with cancer, the vet said she had never seen (apart from the cancer) such a healthy, mobile Golden Retriever at such an advanced age.

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Since I was a kid, I've been thinking up stories. That's nothing special. Like many others, I've never thought of turning storytelling into a career. That's nothing special either. But now I want to change that. I've got stories to tell, I've got people to entertain!</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My first serious project is a funny story. To be precise, a comedy fantasy book. That is, a fantasy tale that doesn't take itself <i>too</i> seriously and has you (hopefully) laughing out loud more than once. Enter <i>Struglend Tales</i>. For reference, if you aren't familiar with the comedy fantasy genre, think <i>Discworld</i>. If you enjoy that universe, chances are you'll like <i>Struglend Tales</i> (though I'm by no means comparing myself to Sir Terry Pratchett).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's the story of Edward, who becomes king of Struglend in a quite roundabout and unexpected way. Shortly thereafter, he manages to lose his kingdom to an evil knight (don't you just hate it when that happens?), and together with his trusty herald Fred, he goes on an epic journey to reclaim his kingdom, and hey, maybe there's some self-discovery sprinkled in here and there as well. You can read more about the book, including a sample chapter, <a href=""http://bouffonbooks.com/books/struglendtales/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">at its website</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, why am I asking for money? Simple, why do we all need money? To live, right. And like all good writers, I don't have a lot of it. Look, I'll be frank. This book will happen, no matter what. But with just a bit more money, I can spend more energy on actually thinking up and writing the story instead of worrying about paying the bills. And with more money come more marketing opportunities, so I can get the word out to people like you - who have <i>exceptional </i>taste when it comes to books.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Oh, what's that? What's in it for you? Well, first of all, even a gift of just one dollar will get you listed on the site, and for four dollars more, your name will be in the book! How cool is that! But the best thing is that warm, fuzzy feeling you get, knowing you helped someone realize their dream. No, my dream is not just publishing a book. My dream is that people will love the book, that while reading it and perhaps even after, they will feel happy.</p>

<p><b>So where will the money go to?</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Basically, it'll go into making the book as professional as possible. Things like getting an ISBN number, setting up an indie publishing company, marketing, they all cost money. If you contribute, know that you will have helped launch an author's career - this is not a one-off, there will be more Struglend (and other) books. And if you really can't give any money, at least ask your (wealthy) friends to help! Thanks so much, you're awesome!</p>
</div></div>","Since I was a kid, I've been thinking up stories. That's nothing special. Like many others, I've never thought of turning storytelling into a career. That's nothing special either. But now I want to change that. I've got stories to tell, I've got people to entertain!

My first serious project is a funny story. To be precise, a comedy fantasy book. That is, a fantasy tale that doesn't take itself too seriously and has you (hopefully) laughing out loud more than once. Enter Struglend Tales. For reference, if you aren't familiar with the comedy fantasy genre, think Discworld. If you enjoy that universe, chances are you'll like Struglend Tales (though I'm by no means comparing myself to Sir Terry Pratchett).

It's the story of Edward, who becomes king of Struglend in a quite roundabout and unexpected way. Shortly thereafter, he manages to lose his kingdom to an evil knight (don't you just hate it when that happens?), and together with his trusty herald Fred, he goes on an epic journey to reclaim his kingdom, and hey, maybe there's some self-discovery sprinkled in here and there as well. You can read more about the book, including a sample chapter, at its website.

Now, why am I asking for money? Simple, why do we all need money? To live, right. And like all good writers, I don't have a lot of it. Look, I'll be frank. This book will happen, no matter what. But with just a bit more money, I can spend more energy on actually thinking up and writing the story instead of worrying about paying the bills. And with more money come more marketing opportunities, so I can get the word out to people like you - who have exceptional taste when it comes to books. Otherwise you wouldn't be here reading this, right?

Oh, what's that? What's in it for you? Well, first of all, even a gift of just one dollar will get you listed on the site, and for four dollars more, your name will be in the book! How cool is that! But the best thing is that warm, fuzzy feeling you get, knowing you helped someone realize their dream. No, my dream is not just publishing a book. My dream is that people will love the book, that while reading it and perhaps even after, they will feel happy.

So where will the money go to?

Basically, it'll go into making the book as professional as possible. Things like getting an ISBN number, setting up an indie publishing company, marketing, they all cost money. If you contribute, know that you will have helped launch an author's career - this is not a one-off, there will be more Struglend (and other) books.

<p><strong>Über das Warrior Magazin</strong></p>
<p>Hier geht es um Kämpfer und Krieger, um Männer und Frauen, die Herz, Disziplin, Ausdauer und Willen haben. Kurz gesagt um die Menschen, die in der Welt der Kampfkunst leben, weil es ihr Weg, ihr Traum und ihre Bestimmung ist.</p>
<p>Das Warrior Magazin ist ein Magazin für – ihr werdet es erraten haben – Menschen mit dem Herzen eines Kriegers. Es war schon lange unser Wunsch so ein Magazin zu machen und dies aus vielerlei Gründen. In unserer Vorstellung steht bei einem solchen Magazin der Mensch im Mittelpunkt und genau deshalb findet ihr hier auch gleich das erste herausstechende Merkmal unseres Warrior-Magazins: Wir schreiben nicht nur ab, was man uns schickt, sondern wir versuchen immer so viele Artikel wie möglich durch Selbsttests „zu erleben“. Dann könnt ihr nämlich auch ganz sicher sein, dass wir genau wissen, wovon wir schreiben.</p>
<p>Die Idee hinter dem Magazin ist also: Wenn jemand ernsthaft trainiert, dann soll er auch die Möglichkeit haben seine Ideen und Erfahrungen mit anderen zu teilen. Dabei ist es völlig egal, ob er eine europäische oder eine asiatische Kampfart betreibt, ob sie klassisch, traditionell oder modern ist, ob er ein 10. Dan Meister eines angesehenen Systems, ein Türsteher, ein Soldat oder ein Vollkontaktkämpfer ist oder vielleicht auch jemand, der von seinen Erfahrungen auf der Straße im Krieg oder im Polizeieinsatz berichten möchte. Denn es geht hier nur um Kämpfer und Menschen, die das Herz eines Kämpfers besitzen. Der Punkt ist, jeder, der ernsthaft trainiert, besiegt sich jeden Tag selbst, besiegt sein Phlegma, seine Trägheit, seine Angst, und dafür verdient er Respekt! Dabei ist es völlig egal, ob er eine Ritterrüstung, einen frisch gebügelten Gi, eine Thaiboxshort oder eine Uniform trägt.</p>
<p>Für all jene gibt es dieses Magazin. Und jetzt kommt das Beste: Wir recherchieren all diese faszinierenden Geschichten über Stile, Schulen und Erfahrungen, besuchen diese mutigen Menschen und schreiben über sie, um unser Heft Nummer 1 letztendlich völlig kostenfrei an jeden abzugeben, der sich dafür interessiert. Ja, ihr lest richtig! Unser Wunsch ist es möglichst viele Leser an unserem Magazin teilhaben zu lassen, deswegen könnt ihr es gratis downloaden und damit die Welt der Krieger betreten. Damit das Ganze eine Zukunft hat: Empfehlt das Heft weiter, schickt eine Kopie an eure Freunde und redet ganz einfach darüber. Schreibt uns, welche Artikel euch am besten gefallen haben, worüber ihr mehr lesen wollt oder was ihr schon immer wissen wolltet und wir sehen was wir für euch tun können. Erlebt die ganze Welt der Krieger – genau hier und jetzt! </p>
<p><strong>Warum wir euch brauchen!</strong></p>
<p>Natürlich stecken in so einem Heft jede Menge Arbeit und es sind auch einige Menschen inolviert. Für die Ausarbeitung der Idee und der Ausgabe Nummer eins haben wir bis jetzt etwa 14 Monate gebraucht. Die redaktion umfasst 4 Personen und 4 Freiwillige. Alle arbeiten bis dato auf eigene Kosten und  auf eigenes Risiko. Um all diesen Leuten wenigstens eine kleine Aufwandsentschädigung bezahlen zu können für all ihre großartige Arbeit brauchen wir euch! </p>
<p>Falls ihr denkt - die haben doch Werbeieinnahmen, dann irrt ihr euch, denn bei einer Erstausgabe ist es leider fast unmöglich Werbepartner zu finden für uns. Das heißt, wir zählen auf euch!</p>
<p>Also ob 1 Euro oder 100 Euro, wir sagen schon mal Danke und werden euch ein ganz fantastisches Magazin dafür geben!</p>
<p><strong>Unsere Geschenke!</strong></p>
<p>Natürlich wollen wir euren Willen zu spenden auch honorieren.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>The </i><i>Future of Governance in Space</i> is an examination of the past, present, and future of space law.<br/><br/>My name is <strong>Lauren Peterson</strong> and I am the author of <strong>The Future of Governance in Space</strong>. I’ve always looked up into the night sky with awe and wonder, ever curious about what exists in the depths of our universe. As a future attorney, I wrote this book to develop a better understanding of what and who actually governs our activities in space, how the governing is currently done, what great challenges need to be overcome, and where we’re going to go from here.<br/><br/><strong>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that space law involves all of us.</strong> In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for space law as it relates to the exploration of outer space, the exploitation of extraterrestrial natural resources, and the invention of novel technology either in space or for use in space. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the greater forces at play surrounding humanity’s activities in outer space.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about exciting examples of international collaboration and the parallels in the development of aviation and maritime law. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>The mission that almost didn't happen, Apollo 8</li>
<li>What legal gymnastics it took to establish and still takes to maintain the International Space Station</li>
<li>How space mining and planetary protection are vital to our success in space</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you have any interest in space, are passionate about cutting-edge international policy, or are interested in novel ideas of how our world might function in the future.<br/><br/>The Future of Governance in Space is a nonfiction book that speaks to space law buffs and casual space fans alike who want to understand public and private international space law in a new way.<br/> <h2> </h2>
<h2>The Book - The Future of Governance in Space</h2>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. This part examines the history of space exploration and space law, a type of law that was brought into creation by the launching of Sputnik, the first orbiting satellite, into space in 1957. It examines the tense negotiations that took place during the Cold War that resulted in the five seminal space treaties. Once the groundwork has been laid, we move on to Part 2.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-9. This dives into the development and mechanics of modern day space law and policy, while highlighting current challenges to the existing framework, such as intellectual property rights and other nonsensical regulations that create arbitrary barriers to collaboration.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters 10-13. This last part examines parallels in legal development in aviation and maritime law, our long-awaited return to the Moon and beyond through the Artemis Program, and discusses how space governance should be executed.<br/><br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</li>
<li>The cover design (the mockups you see currently are a placeholder).</li>
<li>The layout design (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts when I ultimately publish this coming Spring!</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell <strong>120 copies </strong>of my book, I will publish a <strong>paperback and ebook</strong>. When I pre-sell <strong>150 copies </strong>of my book, I will also publish a <strong>hardcover edition</strong>. When I pre-sell <strong>200 copies</strong> of my book, I will publish a <strong>hardcover edition and an audiobook</strong>.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>With this project, we're setting out to get a deluxe hardcover print run of the science fiction story Message in a Bottle. Thanks to the prohibitive length of the source material (over five hundred thousand words!) this project will be Volume One Only. This includes the entire first story as I first imagined it, and nothing marked as ""Part 2"" in the original story.</p>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will cover a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover the cost of ""proof"" books to verify the quality of the print.</li>
<li>Original front and rear cover.</li>
<li>Actual print run, obviously.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book will contain minor corrections to the text made since the original publication, as well as an original short story taking place before ""Part 2"" of the original story that will never be published anywhere else.</p>
<p>Those who want to support the author a little could spring for an autographed copy, or support at the higher ""custom chapter"" tier. Those who support the project at this level will receive a brand new addition to the Message universe, ~2000 words in length, expanding on any aspect of the story of their choosing.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest risk in publishing a story like Message is its enormous length. ""Part One"" of Message in a Bottle is nearly 270,000 words, which approaches the limits of most self-publishing methods. This means that at this time I cannot guarantee a softcover edition, and so will not be listing it as a reward on this campaign. </p>
<p>Because of the volume-oriented nature of book publishing, this project cannot proceed if it is not fully funded. We have thus selected the fixed funding goal, so that interested people can pledge with no risk that you won't get your book. If we don't meet our goal, all funds will be refunded.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't contribute? That's fine! Obviously I'm not printing this story for the money--it's all about getting something awesome out in print.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Innovation Central: Why university-centric makerspaces empower students to change the world.<br/><br/>My name is Emi Makino and I am the author of Innovation Central. I wrote this book because I wanted to share the extraordinary accomplishments of students in Japan and the US, who are using campus makerspaces to literally change the world. Students are proving they are more capable of innovating than most of us imagine.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how students are revolutionizing the world of research and development, thanks to new digital manufacturing technologies. I hope this book will instill in you, the passion and excitement I have for the young entrepreneurs who are driving social change, empowered by campus makerspaces and high-impact educational programming.

Innovation Central: Why university-centric makerspaces empower students to change the world.My name is Emi Makino and I am the author of Innovation Central. I wrote this book because I wanted to share the extraordinary accomplishments of students in Japan and the US, who are using campus makerspaces to literally change the world. Students are proving they are more capable of innovating than most of us imagine.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how students are revolutionizing the world of research and development, thanks to new digital manufacturing technologies. I hope this book will instill in you, the passion and excitement I have for the young entrepreneurs who are driving social change, empowered by campus makerspaces and high-impact educational programming.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>From Auckland-based author/illustrator V. L. Dreyer comes a new story, a story of survival, love and heartbreak set against the backdrop of a world gone wild.</p>
<p>Ten years after a killer virus devastated the world, a small handful of survivors must band together to rebuild what is left of human society.  But can they overcome the trauma of their past, and forgive the horrible things that humanity is capable of in the name of the greater good?</p>

<p><strong><em>Synopsis</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The virus came from deep in Africa. </em></p>
<p> <em>By the time they had a name for the disease it had wiped out half the continent. Within a year, it had decimated our world. Our species is on the verge of extinction. Only a few of us have survived; those of us lucky enough to be born with a natural immunity to the plague. We scavenge amongst the ruins of our old civilizations, picking out a living from the devastation.</em></p>
<p><em>Ten years ago, I watched my family die one by one. Now, I am alone. The year is 2024; it has been a decade since the virus reduced humanity to a scattering of survivors strewn out across the world.</em></p>

<p><em>Without laws to protect the innocent, I have seen the worst of humanity throughout the years. Now, I have found a new family who are determined to show me the best.

<p><em>We are forced to leave our home and flee for our lives. It is only through unity that we stand any chance of survival. Enemies wait around every turn.

<p>- The character may be based off yourself, an original character that is your intellectual property, or it can be a tribute to a friend or family member so long as they provide their written permission to do so.</p>
<p>- The character may NOT be based off a copyrighted character that you do not own the rights to, a person or persons who do not wish to have the character based off them, and it may not be used in a malicious way against any person.</p>
<p>- The writer (V. L. Dreyer) reserves the right to veto any names or traits that are deemed to be overtly insulting, rude or inappropriate to any group or person.  That's not to say your character can't be a rude, horrible pig, so long as it's within the bounds of realism.</p>
<p>- The writer (V. L. Dreyer) will retain the rights to use the character as she sees fit within the bounds of the <em>Survivors</em> universe.  This is limited not only to the books, but also to any future <em>Survivors</em> projects, merchandising, or events.</p>
<p>- If you are using an existing character from your own world/universe (e.g., a cross-over), then you retain rights to that character in your own world.  Events that take place within the <em>Survivors</em> universe will be considered non-canonical within your world, and vice versa.  If you wish to establish a canon crossover, this must be discussed before and a mutually satisfying agreement reached in advance.</p>

From Auckland-based author/illustrator V. L. Dreyer comes a new story, a story of survival, love and heartbreak set against the backdrop of a world gone wild.
Ten years after a killer virus devastated the world, a small handful of survivors must band together to rebuild what is left of human society.  But can they overcome the trauma of their past, and forgive the horrible things that humanity is capable of in the name of the greater good?


Synopsis
The virus came from deep in Africa. 
 By the time they had a name for the disease it had wiped out half the continent. Within a year, it had decimated our world. Our species is on the verge of extinction. Only a few of us have survived; those of us lucky enough to be born with a natural immunity to the plague. We scavenge amongst the ruins of our old civilizations, picking out a living from the devastation.
Ten years ago, I watched my family die one by one. Now, I am alone. The year is 2024; it has been a decade since the virus reduced humanity to a scattering of survivors strewn out across the world.
The rules that governed our society are gone.
Without laws to protect the innocent, I have seen the worst of humanity throughout the years. Now, I have found a new family who are determined to show me the best. But a fresh mutation of the virus has started turning the harmless, pathetic infected into monstrous predatory creatures bent on our destruction; even the wildlife is turning against us.
We are forced to leave our home and flee for our lives. It is only through unity that we stand any chance of survival. Enemies wait around every turn. For the sake of our children and our children’s children, we must find some way to survive and flourish again. If we fail, then the human species will cease to exist.
My name is Sandy McDermott, and I am a survivor. This is my story.

This book has received amazing feedback from the lucky few that have been allowed to see it so far - and I don't just mean my mother!  This is your chance to be part of helping the world see the Next Big Thing.
If this book has one theme, it's that teamwork can make anything happen.  I need you to make this happen. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't financially support us, that is no reason to assume that you can't help.  Even if you can't contribute cash, please, please, please help to get the word out by other means.  Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your mum. Every little bit helps!
 Incentives

- eBook
On completion of the final draft, all contributors will receive a .pdf eBook of The Survivors Book I: Summer emailed to them.  If necessary, I can provide instructions on how to transfer this to your Kindle.
- Bookmarks
The Survivors Book I collectible bookmarks have been created just for this campaign.  At the present moment, they are planned to be 50mm wide and 200mm tall, and will feature a slice of Alais Legrand's magnificent cover art on both the front and the back.  They are matt laminated and can be autographed by the author on request.
- Paperbacks
Fairly self-explanatory.  At the moment, I plan to have them printed through lulu.com and shipped directly to me, where they will be signed and posted back out to contributors.  They will be printed in the pocketbook size.
- Hardbacks
These will be printed through lulu.com and shipped to the author as well, where they will not only be signed, but numbered and dated as well.  Only 20 will be created during the initial print run, so these are collectibles. 
- 8"" x 10"" Semi-Gloss Prints
If your chosen perk includes a print, you may choose from one of the following.  Please be advised that this list is NOT final.  I will be adding to this list often throughout the campaign, and I will update the list whenever I finish a piece or receive one back from its artist.


""The Survivors Book I Cover Art"", Alais Legrand 
""Sandrine McDermott"" Cheesecake Pinup, V. L. Dreyer (Coming Soon)

The Heroic Rules of Engagement
- The character may be based off yourself, an original character that is your intellectual property, or it can be a tribute to a friend or family member so long as they provide their written permission to do so.
- The character may NOT be based off a copyrighted character that you do not own the rights to, a person or persons who do not wish to have the character based off them, and it may not be used in a malicious way against any person.
- The writer (V. L. Dreyer) reserves the right to veto any names or traits that are deemed to be overtly insulting, rude or inappropriate to any group or person.  That's not to say your character can't be a rude, horrible pig, so long as it's within the bounds of realism.
- The writer (V. L. Dreyer) will retain the rights to use the character as she sees fit within the bounds of the Survivors universe.  This is limited not only to the books, but also to any future Survivors projects, merchandising, or events.
- If you are using an existing character from your own world/universe (e.g., a cross-over), then you retain rights to that character in your own world.  Events that take place within the Survivors universe will be considered non-canonical within your world, and vice versa.  If you wish to establish a canon crossover, this must be discussed before and a mutually satisfying agreement reached in advance.
 
Terms & Conditions
- The Survivors Book I: Summer contains adult situations including death, violence, sexual situations and bad language.  If you are offended by or not legally allowed to view any of the above, please consider yourself warned.  I take no responsibility for any of the above.  You have been warned.
- As this is a fundraiser, the printing and publishing process will not begin until after the campaign is over.  As such, please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery, maybe more if there are hitches along the way.  However, I will endeavour to keep you up to date all the way through.

<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>As my campaign is winding down I want to sincerely thank all of my amazing supporters and contributors. <br/></p>
<p>I also wanted to include an excerpt from one of my stories to give readers a feel for what my style and content would be. </p>
<p>""My brother, David is a schizo-effective - which means he's schizophrenic AND bipolar for added fun. He's had a rough go at things. It's hard to know if he would have been semi-normal in a more stable environment, or if fate or what have you, just doomed him from the start. He was diagnosed when he was 13 after some pretty severe trauma, after which they put him in what is called a chemical straightjacket, which means he's so drugged up that he can't really move, think, or feel anything.  <br/></p>
<p>He has always tried very hard to fit in with little success. Eventually he started embracing being an outcast. He loved the movie the Crow with Bruce Lee in it. He identified with the character so much so that he could call himself the Crow and paint his face for Halloween and write the symbol in his own yearbook. He wanted attention more than anything. In high school he went around asking his fellow students for a quarter so he could call in a bomb threat. He then did in fact call in a bomb threat. Of course, none of his classmates felt the need to protect him, and they immediately told on him. Fortunately this was before bomb threats were a huge deal. He was expelled from school and my stepfather home schooled him instead.<br/><br/>He used to go around town and ask people for drugs. He thought he could fit in that way. Most people would give him pieces of paper and tell him it was acid and watch him pretend to trip for fun. One time, when he was around 17, someone gave him real acid and he had convulsions on the street and had to be hospitalized. I remember people hearing the story and being angry that someone had given him real drugs.</p>
<p>He is mentally impaired now from all the severe anti psychotic medications he's been on for the past twenty years. He doesn’t do well when he is expected to be responsible for himself. He’ll do things to jeopardize his freedom. He to this day goes in and out of mental hospitals. He was told several years ago that he had used up his lifetime allowance of hospitalizations. The only way he could get into a hospital going forward is if he's a danger to himself or others. He is so institutionalized at this point that he needs the structure that hospitals and jails provide. <br/></p>
<p>Because of his mental impairment he is easy prey for assholes. In jail it became a game to see what they could get him to do. One time a fellow inmate promised his girlfriend would post David’s bail if he set off a fire alarm. Another time he was promised freedom if he rubbed his feces all over his cell. He spent several months in solitary confinement for these “pranks.” One time his inmates convinced him that he would get released if he injured himself. In response he jumped off a two-story ledge and fractured his leg and ankle in several places. He still tries really hard to fit in. He’s tried to be a Mormon but he couldn’t quit smoking long enough. He’s toyed with the idea of Satanism but I always tell him that it is a horrible idea. He wants to be a Juggalo really badly (which is an extreme fan of the band Insane Clown Posse, or ICP). He tried for years to become a Catholic but kept breaking rules, but alas he made it. He is Catholic now, but still wants to be a Pagan from time to time. <br/></p>
<p>It’s really hard to not feel sorry for him but he doesn’t feel sorry for himself. He doesn’t know any other reality than the one he has.  He just got assigned a guardian by the state. This person has a say in everything he does. It can be bad if there is a support network that disagrees but he doesn’t have that and needs someone to look out for him in all of his decisions. He will hopefully get placed in a healthy environment soon.""<br/></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm from West Virginia. Consider stereotypes of West Virginia: poor, backwards, bad teeth, mental illness to name a few...  Sometimes there are some truths behind stereotypes (not say that all inhabitants fit into this category).  I was raised in an improverished family and was in foster care for a stint. I would like to write a memoir to tell my story. </p>
<p>Not to say that a book I'd write would be all doom and gloom. I have a sense of humor, but I would like to take a crack at explaining some difficult situations. I studied Philosophy and Sociology in undergrad and feel like I can uniquely view my upbringing.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">I want to ""shed some light"" on hard topics, so my incentive prizes are based around candles that I will make. </span></p>

<p>
</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">I've done some research on book writing and the costs build up quickly. </span></p>
<p>I would like to take some creative writing classes to help get the tools to write a compelling story so would be around $2,000 - based on taking multiple classes from this renowned organization: <a href=""http://www.sfgrotto.org/classes/past-classes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sfgrotto.org/classes/past-classes</a></p>
<p>I would like to get an agent, if possible and go through a publisher, but if not, then I would self publish. </p>
<p>Using this site I've estimate the rough cost to be around $7,000 to self publish: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/05/the-real-costs-of-self-publishing-book"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/05/the-real-costs-of-self-publishing-book</a> </p>
<p>The candles that I intend to make will be very high quality. Soy based wax that is eco-friendly and long burning. There will be fragrance and non-fragrance options. You will get your choice of candle, scent, and color if you'd like. They will be in repurposed containers, thrift shop cups, glass jars, etc. For high level donations, I will handcraft unique ceramic dishes. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
There are many problems that face underpriviledged groups in our society and many members of these populations don't have a voice. I'd like to lead by example and share my story in the hopes that it will inspire change and empower others.<p></p>

public elementary school that is comprised of about half Amish students. 
Last year when I was working with a second grade Amish student helping her pick
out a book in the library, she said, 'Mrs. Anderson, why aren't there any books
with Amish kids in them?""</p>
<p>  So
I wrote a book for Sharon with the help of a local couple who helped me
translate the book into Dutch, the Amish language.  It was not easy,
because Dutch is not a written language, so the Dutch passages are phonetically
spelled.  The book is written in English, and every other paragraph is the
Dutch translation of the story. </p>
<p> 
The book is written for elementary age children and is the first in a series
called The Adventures of Katie and Ben: At the Creek.  I envision this
series portraying Katie and Ben's adventures on the family farm and community.</p>
<p> 
I believe this book is a winning idea on two different levels: </p>
<p>1. The Amish market.
Hundreds of Amish kindergarten students enter public school in our area and
around the country with only a minimal amount of experience speaking
English.  My book, which I believe is the first of its kind, would help
bridge the gap from home to school in an entertaining way.  </p>
<p>2.  The tourist
market.  Our area (and other areas of the country like Pennsylvania and
Ohio) attracts tens of thousands of tourists every summer who come to enjoy the
quiet communities, the Amish lifestyle, and one of the largest flea markets in
the country bringing over a half million tourists per year to town.  I think this book would sell very well to tourists who would
enjoy trying to speak Dutch as a remembrance of their experience here.  </p>
<p> 
I would like $2000 for an initial self-publishing book run of several
hundred copies and advertising.  After that, the selling of
additional books would pay for more copies to become self-sustaining.</p><br/><p></p></div>","I work in a
public elementary school that is comprised of about half Amish students. 
Last year when I was working with a second grade Amish student helping her pick
out a book in the library, she said, 'Mrs. Anderson, why aren't there any books
with Amish kids in them?""
  So
I wrote a book for Sharon with the help of a local couple who helped me
translate the book into Dutch, the Amish language.  It was not easy,
because Dutch is not a written language, so the Dutch passages are phonetically
spelled.  The book is written in English, and every other paragraph is the
Dutch translation of the story. 
 
The book is written for elementary age children and is the first in a series
called The Adventures of Katie and Ben: At the Creek.  I envision this
series portraying Katie and Ben's adventures on the family farm and community.
 
I believe this book is a winning idea on two different levels: 
1. The Amish market.
Hundreds of Amish kindergarten students enter public school in our area and
around the country with only a minimal amount of experience speaking
English.  My book, which I believe is the first of its kind, would help
bridge the gap from home to school in an entertaining way.  
2.  The tourist
market.  Our area (and other areas of the country like Pennsylvania and
Ohio) attracts tens of thousands of tourists every summer who come to enjoy the
quiet communities, the Amish lifestyle, and one of the largest flea markets in
the country bringing over a half million tourists per year to town.  I think this book would sell very well to tourists who would
enjoy trying to speak Dutch as a remembrance of their experience here.  
 
I would like $2000 for an initial self-publishing book run of several
hundred copies and advertising.  After that, the selling of
additional books would pay for more copies to become self-sustaining.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<i><b>Was ist das Land der Hoffnung</b></i><i><b>?</b></i>
</h1><p>
</p><p><b>希望の国とは？</b></p>
<br/><p>Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. </p><p><i>Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.</i></p><p>何年も前の事ですが、サンフランシスコバレエ団でソリストとして踊っていた頃、私は舞台裏で待っている間９年の歳月をかけ、大掛かりなプロ
ジェクトを手掛けました。それは、一枚の無地の生地に「ニードルペインティング」（刺繍）で、美しい風景を描くものでした。出来上がった作品は、下の写真
でご覧いただける通り、自然と人間が完全に調和して暮らす素晴らしい世界を描いています。それは、大人も子どもも皆が良い行いをしたら世界はきっとこんな
風になるだろうと私が信じる「希望の国」を表現しています。</p><p>After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important lessons.</p><p><i>Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als 
Hintergrund benutze ich Nahaufnahmen des Needlepainting Werkes Land of 
Hope.</i></p><p>

<b>
</b><p><b>あらすじ</b></p>
<br/><p>The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. </p>
<p>One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. </p>
<p><i>Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!</i></p>
<p>主人公は、芝生の草よりも背の低いペピートです。彼は、周りにいる大きくて強い男の人たちに憧れています。ペピートの一番の願いは彼等のよ
うに強くてたくましくなる事です。ある日、ペピートが目覚めると、彼は希望の国にいました。そこで彼は、風変わりで素敵な住人たちに出会う度に、どうした
ら強く、大きくなれるか尋ねました。</p>
<p>希望の国の住人達は、ペピートの問いかけに、他者に敬意を持って接する事、困った人を助ける事、困難な状況でも勇気を持って立ち向かう事など様々な
助言をくれました。最後にペピートは、身体が大きいことより、大きな心を持つ方が大事だということ、自分がどんなに小柄でも世の中を大きく変えられるんだ
という事に気がつきました。</p>

<h1><b><br/></b></h1>
<h1><b>Why is this so important? </b></h1>
<h1><b><i>Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?</i></b></h1>
<div>
<b>
</b><p><b>このプロジェクトの重要性</b></p>
<br/><p>It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.</p>
<p><i>Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!</i></p>
<p>今
の子ども達は、正しい価値観を持つ大人へと成長する課程において、良い影響を与えられる機会が減っているのではないかと感じています。私たち大人が、思い
やりと正しい心をもつ子どもを育てることができれば、世界にもっと有益な変化をもたらし、社会に貢献できると考えています。今、世界ではさまざまな問題が
起きていて、本来なら手にできるはずの幸せな生活を送れない人々がいます。将来をになう子ども達に、人に対する思いやりを育くみ、大切さを教え伝えること
ができたら、きっといつか、それが世界の平和につながっていくに違いないと考えます。子ども達に強い正義感や前向きに生きていくすばらしさを伝えることが
できたら、この「希望の国」を布の上の刺繍の世界から現実のものに近づけることができるはずです。</p>
<p>We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.</p>
<p><i>Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,</i></p>
<p>私は、次に挙げます二つの理由でこの絵本を多国語で出版したいと考えています。まず一つ目は、英語圏だけでなく、世界中の子ども達にペピー
トの冒険を楽しんでもらいたいと思っています。そして二つ目は、子ども達には早くから外国語に触れる機会を与え、自国とは異なる文化に興味を持ち、他者に
対する共感や、協調性を養う事に役立ててほしいと思うからです。</p>

以上二点は、この絵本から学んでもらいたい他の大切な価値観とともに、子ども達がグローバル化が進む現代社会を生きていくために、非常に役立つものだと考
えます。　先ずは、英語、ドイツ語で出版する事が目標ですが、現在、日本語への翻訳も検討中です。賛同・支援して下さる方がいれば、その他の言語への翻訳
も検討したいと思っております。当プロジェクトの進展については、随時ご報告申し上げます。<br/><h1><b><br/></b></h1>

</b><p><b>皆様のご支援のお願い</b></p>
<p></p>
<br/><p>Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. </p>
<p><i>Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. </i></p>
<p>「希望の国」の原稿は、既に出来上がっており、ドイツの出版社、S. Fischer 
Verlageから、絵本を世に送りだす準備を進めています。しかし、出版には、最低でも7,000ユーロの出資を要します。これは、私が個人的に用意で
きる金額を上回るものです。そのため、ぜひ皆様のご支援を頂ければと、今回お願いしております次第です。ご賛同いただきご支援を賜ることができましたら幸
いです。</p>
<p>However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.</p>
<p><i>Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. </i></p>
<p>上記の金額は、出版に最低限必要な額であり、編集、印刷、製本、広告、発送、国内外への書籍流通・販売、そして、子ども達にとって親しみや
すい大きめのサイズ、読みやすいフォーマットにするなど、多少の工夫を加えますと、必要経費は13,000ユーロ程度になると概算しております。目標金額
を低めに設定したほうがプロジェクトの成功率が高いという統計を目にしたこともありますが、わたし達としましても、皆様の温かいご支援をいただき、子ども
達のためにより質の高い絵本を届けることができるよう、努力を惜しまない所存です。</p>
<p>Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.</p>
<p><i>Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen. </i></p>

<p> This book is perfect for parents of young
 children, expecting parents, or even aunts, uncles, grandparents, and 
other relatives searching for a gift for the young ones in their lives. </p>

<br/><p>October 31st, 2014: Crowdfunding begins!</p>
<p>Mid-December
 2014: Crowdfunding ends, all funds calculated, collected, and sent to 
publishers. Digital perks sent to supporters - just in time for the

Sommer/Herbst 2015: alle nicht-digitalen Perks , d.h. alle Geschenke werden verschickt, pünktlich zum nächsten Fest!</i></p>
<p>2014年10月31日：クラウドファンディング開始！</p>
<p>2014年12月中旬：クラウドファンディング終了。支援額の計算、出版社に送金。支援者への特典中、ネット上送信できるものは、クリスマス前にお届けします！</p>
<p>2015年1月：出版社「希望の国」絵本制作開始</p>

<p>2015年夏・秋期：デジタル以外の特典を支援者様へ郵送。</p>
<p>Realistically, we know lots of things could happen to 
delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. </p>
<p><i>Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner 
dauern, Versandzeiten können abweichen (vor allem international). Falls 
eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.</i></p>
<p>以上は、あくまでも想定しているタイムラインであり、現実的には、様々な原因でプロセスに遅れが出る可能性が考えられます。例えば、当キャ
ンペーン中に集められた支援金が目標額を下回った場合、残りの必要な額を集めて出版社に送金するのに時間がかかったり、印刷が予想以上に長引いたり、郵
送、特にホリデー・シーズン中の海外郵送に時間がかかる事など考えられます。このの様な状況に変更があり次第、責任を持って皆様に随時ご報告致します。</p>

Was ist das Land der Hoffnung?

希望の国とは？
Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.何年も前の事ですが、サンフランシスコバレエ団でソリストとして踊っていた頃、私は舞台裏で待っている間９年の歳月をかけ、大掛かりなプロ
ジェクトを手掛けました。それは、一枚の無地の生地に「ニードルペインティング」（刺繍）で、美しい風景を描くものでした。出来上がった作品は、下の写真
でご覧いただける通り、自然と人間が完全に調和して暮らす素晴らしい世界を描いています。それは、大人も子どもも皆が良い行いをしたら世界はきっとこんな
風になるだろうと私が信じる「希望の国」を表現しています。After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important lessons.Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als 
Hintergrund benutze ich Nahaufnahmen des Needlepainting Werkes Land of 
Hope.
バレエの世界を離れた後、私は妻と共にベルリンにスタジオを開きました。そこで私達は、子どもだった生徒達が友情、勇敢、誠実さを大切にする、輝きにあふ
れた大人へと成長し羽ばたいて行く姿を目の当たりにしました。社会で活躍する彼等の姿に私は強く心を動かされ、更に多くの子ども達に、私の生徒達の様に成
長して、より良い世界を作ってほしいと願うようになり、多言語の絵本を作ろうと決心しました。この絵本は、「希望の国」の刺繍のイメージを用いて、人を敬
う事、勇気を持つ事、人に親切に接する事といった大切な人生のレッスンが、子ども達の素晴らしい成長に結びついていくということを物語っています。

The completed Land of Hope, a full landscape in astonishing detail.


「希望の国」の全貌
The StoryDie Geschichte

あらすじ
The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. 
One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. 
Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!
主人公は、芝生の草よりも背の低いペピートです。彼は、周りにいる大きくて強い男の人たちに憧れています。ペピートの一番の願いは彼等のよ
うに強くてたくましくなる事です。ある日、ペピートが目覚めると、彼は希望の国にいました。そこで彼は、風変わりで素敵な住人たちに出会う度に、どうした
ら強く、大きくなれるか尋ねました。
希望の国の住人達は、ペピートの問いかけに、他者に敬意を持って接する事、困った人を助ける事、困難な状況でも勇気を持って立ち向かう事など様々な
助言をくれました。最後にペピートは、身体が大きいことより、大きな心を持つ方が大事だということ、自分がどんなに小柄でも世の中を大きく変えられるんだ
という事に気がつきました。


One of Horacio's sketches of Pepito. Various images like this one 
will be scattered throughout the pages for children to find - more 
information on the imagined layout can be found further down on this 
page.Dies
 ist eine von Horacio´s Zeichnungen. Dies ist Pepito, der auf vielen 
Seiten auftaucht, wo ihn die Kinder suchen müssen. Mehr Information zum 
Lay-Out  weiter  unten auf deiser seite.


オーラシオが描いたペピートのスケッチ。このようなイメージを絵本の所々に描いて、子ども達に楽しんでもらおうと思っています。絵本のレイアウトに関しては、下記をご覧下さい。

Why is this so important? 
Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?


このプロジェクトの重要性
It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.
Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!
今
の子ども達は、正しい価値観を持つ大人へと成長する課程において、良い影響を与えられる機会が減っているのではないかと感じています。私たち大人が、思い
やりと正しい心をもつ子どもを育てることができれば、世界にもっと有益な変化をもたらし、社会に貢献できると考えています。今、世界ではさまざまな問題が
起きていて、本来なら手にできるはずの幸せな生活を送れない人々がいます。将来をになう子ども達に、人に対する思いやりを育くみ、大切さを教え伝えること
ができたら、きっといつか、それが世界の平和につながっていくに違いないと考えます。子ども達に強い正義感や前向きに生きていくすばらしさを伝えることが
できたら、この「希望の国」を布の上の刺繍の世界から現実のものに近づけることができるはずです。
We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.
Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,
私は、次に挙げます二つの理由でこの絵本を多国語で出版したいと考えています。まず一つ目は、英語圏だけでなく、世界中の子ども達にペピー
トの冒険を楽しんでもらいたいと思っています。そして二つ目は、子ども達には早くから外国語に触れる機会を与え、自国とは異なる文化に興味を持ち、他者に
対する共感や、協調性を養う事に役立ててほしいと思うからです。

以上二点は、この絵本から学んでもらいたい他の大切な価値観とともに、子ども達がグローバル化が進む現代社会を生きていくために、非常に役立つものだと考
えます。　先ずは、英語、ドイツ語で出版する事が目標ですが、現在、日本語への翻訳も検討中です。賛同・支援して下さる方がいれば、その他の言語への翻訳
も検討したいと思っております。当プロジェクトの進展については、随時ご報告申し上げます。
What We Need
Was wir brauchen


皆様のご支援のお願い

Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. 
Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. 
「希望の国」の原稿は、既に出来上がっており、ドイツの出版社、S. Fischer 
Verlageから、絵本を世に送りだす準備を進めています。しかし、出版には、最低でも7,000ユーロの出資を要します。これは、私が個人的に用意で
きる金額を上回るものです。そのため、ぜひ皆様のご支援を頂ければと、今回お願いしております次第です。ご賛同いただきご支援を賜ることができましたら幸
いです。
However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.
Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. 
上記の金額は、出版に最低限必要な額であり、編集、印刷、製本、広告、発送、国内外への書籍流通・販売、そして、子ども達にとって親しみや
すい大きめのサイズ、読みやすいフォーマットにするなど、多少の工夫を加えますと、必要経費は13,000ユーロ程度になると概算しております。目標金額
を低めに設定したほうがプロジェクトの成功率が高いという統計を目にしたこともありますが、わたし達としましても、皆様の温かいご支援をいただき、子ども
達のためにより質の高い絵本を届けることができるよう、努力を惜しまない所存です。
Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.
Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen.

Predicted Timeline
Zeitplan

想定タイムライン
So, how long is this all going to take? 
So, wann wird was passieren?
このプロジェクトのタイムスケジュールは、どの様なものでしょうか。
In a perfect world, the timeline would look something like this:
Wenn alles klappt, sieht der Plan aus wie folgt:
想定しているタイムスケジュールは、以下の通りです。
October 31st, 2014: Crowdfunding begins!
Mid-December
 2014: Crowdfunding ends, all funds calculated, collected, and sent to 
publishers. Digital perks sent to supporters - just in time for the 
holidays!
January 2015: Publishing company begins production process for Land of Hope
Summer 2015: Printing is completed, books sent to Horacio and later distributed to bookstores
Summer/Fall 2015: Physical rewards shipped out to supporters, arriving once again just in time for the holidays!
31. Oktober 2014: das Crowdfunding beginnt!
Mitte Dezenber 2014: das Crowdfunding endet, alle Spenden gehen an den 
Verlag, die digitalen Perks (Belohnungen)  gehen an die Spender, 
pünktlich zum Weihnachtsfest!
Januar 2015: der Verlag beginnt die Produktion.
Sommer 2015: der Druck ist fertig, die Bücher werden versendet und an Buchläden verschickt.
Sommer/Herbst 2015: alle nicht-digitalen Perks , d.h. alle Geschenke werden verschickt, pünktlich zum nächsten Fest!
2014年10月31日：クラウドファンディング開始！
2014年12月中旬：クラウドファンディング終了。支援額の計算、出版社に送金。支援者への特典中、ネット上送信できるものは、クリスマス前にお届けします！
2015年1月：出版社「希望の国」絵本制作開始
2015年夏期：印刷・製本終了。オーラシオの手元に本が届けられ、いよいよ書店流通へ。
2015年夏・秋期：デジタル以外の特典を支援者様へ郵送。
Realistically, we know lots of things could happen to 
delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. 
Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner 
dauern, Versandzeiten können abweichen (vor allem international). Falls 
eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.
以上は、あくまでも想定しているタイムラインであり、現実的には、様々な原因でプロセスに遅れが出る可能性が考えられます。例えば、当キャ
ンペーン中に集められた支援金が目標額を下回った場合、残りの必要な額を集めて出版社に送金するのに時間がかかったり、印刷が予想以上に長引いたり、郵
送、特にホリデー・シーズン中の海外郵送に時間がかかる事など考えられます。このの様な状況に変更があり次第、責任を持って皆様に随時ご報告致します。
How it Will Look
Wie wird das Buch aussehen?

完成した絵本
We are envisioning our book to be approximately 22 x 1 x 30
 centimeters. Each turn of the page will reveal a beautiful photograph 
from the Land of Hope tapestry, with a corresponding text (in at least 
two languages) on the other side that tells Pepito's story. Small 
sketches of the little man in various poses will appear alongside the 
text.
Wir planen das Buch in der Größe 22
 x 1 x 30 cm. Bei jedem Umblättern sieht man eine neue Seite mit einem 
Bildausschenitt des Werkes ""Land der Hoffnung"" zeigen mit den dazu 
gehörigen Texten in mindestens zwei Sprachen auf der gegenüberliegenden 
Seite. Kleine Zeichnungen des kleinen Pepito ergänzen das Bild.
完成した絵本は、22cm x 1cm x 30cm 
程のサイズを考えています。各ページを開くと、そこには、「希望の国」刺繍のタペストリーの美しい写真が広がり、それにあわせて少なくとも2つ以上の言語
でペピートのお話しを描きます。文章の隣には、かわいらしいペピートが様々なポーズで現れます。


One of our draft pages. So far, this only has the German text, and 
the height isn't exactly right. As soon as we have an updated version of
 this, we will let you know! See below for the English and Japanese translations that 
will be on this page: Hier ein Beispiel, erstmal nur mit dem deutschen Text und vorläufigem Format. Der englische Text folgt:


絵本の中のあるページのドラフトです。ここでは、皆さまに絵本のイメージをお伝えするために見本としてドイツ語の本文を入れてあります。本のサイズ少々完成版と異なります。校正したものができましたら改めて掲載します。下記に日本語の仮訳を掲載しましたのでご覧ください。
'To his great surprise Pepito met a man who was even smaller then he was.
Pepito said to him: “How can you be happy being so very small?”
And the small man answered: “Because I see that life is full of treasures like this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”
“Yes”, said Pepito, “I see. But I want to be big.”
“Good,"" said the small man, “then you must respect all persons 
whether they are smaller or bigger than you; then you will be big. Come 
with me to the pond for a drink.”'

ペピートはびっくりして目を丸くしました。
ここには、僕より小さい住人がいたなんて！
「どうしてそんなに小さくても幸せでいられるの？」ペピートは、尋ねました。
「それは、この虹の果てにある黄金の壷の様な宝ものが、人生には、たくさんあるからだよ。」と応えました。
「へぇ。そうなんだ。」「でもね、ぼくは、大きくなりたいんだ。」
「そうか。」その小さな住人は言いました。「それなら、自分より大きい人でも、小さい人でも、誰に対しても敬意をもって接することだな。そうしたら君は大きくなれるさ。ほら、一緒に池のほうにいって何か飲もうじゃないか。」

<p>What would you do if there was a tiger on your couch?</p><p>Would you scream and run, or grab a broom and face the beast? <br/></p><p>What if that tiger represented your passions? Your dreams? Your deepest desires,
and even your fears?</p><p>In 2011, after being laid off from another disappearing job, I opened my door and realized
I was facing that tiger. <br/></p><p>It was time to make a choice. Force myself into an unstable career that didn't excite me, or take the plunge and start building the career I had previously only dreamed of. I decided to make friends with the tiger.  <br/></p>
<p>While trying to get back on my feet financially, I wrote and self-published my first
novel, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-The-Shielded-Realms-ebook/dp/B00CVZOKHG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375385784&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=elayne+griffith"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sapphire</a>, and realized that a career as an author might actually be attainable!  I could fuse my passion for writing with my deep desire to help make a difference in the world.  <br/></p><p> So here I am. I currently work on a local organic farm that helps support my climb towards a career as an Author. It often feels like a big scary gamble, but I'm not giving up, and have never been more excited!<br/></p><p>I've launched this campaign to help raise the necessary funds to enable me to properly self publish and market my most recently completed book, Following Amur, a comedic spiritual adventure. This novelette has been inspired by my own life's challenges, and I believe, has<span style=""""> amazing potential to encourage</span><span style=""""> it's readers to make positive change in their own lives.</span><span style=""""> The story </span><span style="""">follows a young woman's journey of self discovery as she encounters a witty down-to-earth monk, and mysterious mystical tiger who both have important lessons to impart.  You can read the first (unedited) chapter </span><a href=""http://elaynegriffith.wordpress.com/2014/01/18/i-never-wear-my-socks-during-sex/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style="""" target=""_blank"">here</a><span style="""">!</span></p><p><br/></p><p><b>There's a Monk at the door?</b></p>
<p>In addition to writing quirky adventure stories, I am committed to helping make a difference in the world, and since a ""tiger on the couch"" was what started it all for me, what better place to start than with a conservation effort.</p><p>There are sadly only 300 Amur (or
Siberian tigers) left in the wild. About 3000 total wild tigers, and
all together only 10,000 tigers left in the entire world!<br/></p><p>To help solve this tragedy, 20% of all profits from Following Amur's sales will be donated to wild tiger conservation.

<p></p></div>","There's a Tiger on the Couch!
What would you do if there was a tiger on your couch?Would you scream and run, or grab a broom and face the beast? What if that tiger represented your passions? Your dreams? Your deepest desires,
and even your fears?In 2011, after being laid off from another disappearing job, I opened my door and realized
I was facing that tiger. It was time to make a choice. Force myself into an unstable career that didn't excite me, or take the plunge and start building the career I had previously only dreamed of. I decided to make friends with the tiger.  
While trying to get back on my feet financially, I wrote and self-published my first
novel, Sapphire, and realized that a career as an author might actually be attainable!  I could fuse my passion for writing with my deep desire to help make a difference in the world.   So here I am. I currently work on a local organic farm that helps support my climb towards a career as an Author. It often feels like a big scary gamble, but I'm not giving up, and have never been more excited!I've launched this campaign to help raise the necessary funds to enable me to properly self publish and market my most recently completed book, Following Amur, a comedic spiritual adventure. This novelette has been inspired by my own life's challenges, and I believe, has amazing potential to encourage it's readers to make positive change in their own lives. The story follows a young woman's journey of self discovery as she encounters a witty down-to-earth monk, and mysterious mystical tiger who both have important lessons to impart.  You can read the first (unedited) chapter here!There's a Monk at the door?
In addition to writing quirky adventure stories, I am committed to helping make a difference in the world, and since a ""tiger on the couch"" was what started it all for me, what better place to start than with a conservation effort.There are sadly only 300 Amur (or
Siberian tigers) left in the wild. About 3000 total wild tigers, and
all together only 10,000 tigers left in the entire world!To help solve this tragedy, 20% of all profits from Following Amur's sales will be donated to wild tiger conservation. I will regularly post each month's donation to my blog so you can follow the ongoing effort. Together with my readers, we'll help protect the future of this amazing creature, and my muse.
Through all my writing, I aim to inspire others to create positive change in their lives and in the world. By supporting this campaign, you are not only supporting me in this endeavor, but also helping save the tigers.   
What Happens if You Follow the Tiger?Trying to climb the ""Author Mountain"" all on your own is like...well,
like this kooky little cartoon I drew. To be honest, I was scared to even ask, but have now come to realize that I need a little help from my friends to make it all happen. I truly feel that Following Amur has incredible potential to jump-start my writing career and propel me to the next level. I'm here asking for your support to get it off the ground. I have a goal of raising $4000 dollars to help edit, publish, and market Following Amur, as well as obtain a computer to make future projects possible.  Any funds raised will be specifically allocated in this order:First: Professional editing: $700Second: Buying the rights to the book trailer: $200 for the video clips from ShutterStock. Third: Podcast advertisements: $1500. Facebook advertisements $600. I need

I really need a new machine that will allow me to write efficiently, and work on my various graphic design and video projects. Fifth: Any extra funds raised will go towards more marketing and website design.
If I can raise just $4000, it will make a world of difference to me, and I will help make a
difference in the world.Journey into the Wild.

to meet with industry experts in low-key, one-on-one conversations. During the course of the event, emerging writers will sit down with five professionals—writers, editors, agents, and teachers—for informal speed dates. This is the writer's time to individualize him/herself, to ask questions, and to learn about what these leaders do and how they got to where they are. After a ten minute ‘date,’ the writer moves down the line. </p>

<p><i>""Things have come to a pass where lying sounds like
truth, truth like lying. Each statement. each piece of news, each thought has
been performed by the centers of the culture industry. Whatever lacks the
familiar trace of such pre-formation lacks credibility, the more so because the
institutions of public opinion accompany what they send forth by a thousand
factual proofs and all the plausibility that total power can lay hands on.
Truth that opposes these pressures not only appears improbable, but is in
addition too feeble to make any headway in competition with their
highly-concentrated machinery of dissemination."" </i></p>
<p>Almost 70 years later, what Adorno predicted has come to
pass. The humanities have been eclipsed by empiricism and the cult of
usefulness, encroaching on the study of alternative ontologies and ways of
knowing. In mainstream media, critics of political economy have been relegated
to extremist roles as the ""threadbare ideologies"" of the market weave
living false histories. <i>E&amp;F</i> seeks
and publishes work that explores, annihilates, and celebrates new spaces of
unknowing that arise in this turbulent cloud of mixed information.</p>
<p>We encourage you to read <i>E&amp;F</i>
online at essaysandfictions.com. Our work will continue to be made available to
the public, free of charge. We are proponents of elitism in literature, but of
elitism with access.  <i>

<p></p><div style="""">
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>""The very title,
Essays &amp; Fictions, indicates the originality of this review. Some of the
most essential prose written today, worldwide, lies ""between the
genres"": prose which belongs sensu stricto neither to the novel, nor to
the short story, nor to the prose poem, nor to the essay, nor to the memoir,
yet which partakes of some or all of these in form and contents. There is also
a nuance to be defined between what is commonly called the 'personal essay' and
what Essays &amp; Fictions is seeking and has published. That nuance is
Literature with a capital ""L."" As a critic specialized in European
writing, I have long reviewed such prose. As a translator of Greek and French
literature, I have sometimes attempted to render it in English. My versions of
unclassifiable prose texts by two important European poets, Veroniki Dalakoura
and Philippe Jaccottet, found a home in Essays &amp; Fictions. For this I am
grateful as well as for the discoveries that the review enables me to make.

Building a sustainable model for propagating literature that cultivates and celebrates the hybrid mind begins with you, the reader. To set this project in motion, we
require initial capital. Your contributions will fund the journal’s
publication, advertising expenses, 501c3 filing costs, and seed funds for the e-Novella project. A detailed budget can be found below.  

In 1945, critic and philosopher Theodor Adorno wrote:

""Things have come to a pass where lying sounds like
truth, truth like lying. Each statement. each piece of news, each thought has
been performed by the centers of the culture industry. Whatever lacks the
familiar trace of such pre-formation lacks credibility, the more so because the
institutions of public opinion accompany what they send forth by a thousand
factual proofs and all the plausibility that total power can lay hands on.
Truth that opposes these pressures not only appears improbable, but is in
addition too feeble to make any headway in competition with their
highly-concentrated machinery of dissemination."" 
Almost 70 years later, what Adorno predicted has come to
pass. The humanities have been eclipsed by empiricism and the cult of
usefulness, encroaching on the study of alternative ontologies and ways of
knowing. In mainstream media, critics of political economy have been relegated
to extremist roles as the ""threadbare ideologies"" of the market weave
living false histories. E&F seeks
and publishes work that explores, annihilates, and celebrates new spaces of
unknowing that arise in this turbulent cloud of mixed information.
We encourage you to read E&F
online at essaysandfictions.com. Our work will continue to be made available to
the public, free of charge. We are proponents of elitism in literature, but of
elitism with access.  
Acclaim for Essays & Fictions

""The very title,
Essays & Fictions, indicates the originality of this review. Some of the
most essential prose written today, worldwide, lies ""between the
genres"": prose which belongs sensu stricto neither to the novel, nor to
the short story, nor to the prose poem, nor to the essay, nor to the memoir,
yet which partakes of some or all of these in form and contents. There is also
a nuance to be defined between what is commonly called the 'personal essay' and
what Essays & Fictions is seeking and has published. That nuance is
Literature with a capital ""L."" As a critic specialized in European
writing, I have long reviewed such prose. As a translator of Greek and French
literature, I have sometimes attempted to render it in English. My versions of
unclassifiable prose texts by two important European poets, Veroniki Dalakoura
and Philippe Jaccottet, found a home in Essays & Fictions. For this I am
grateful as well as for the discoveries that the review enables me to make.
Kudos to the editors for their openness and perspicacity!"" – John Taylor

In 2011, Essays &
Fictions received an honorable recognition in Best American Essays for the publication of John Edwards’ breach
work “Revolutionary Wrath: A (Seriously) Biased Revision of the Burr vs.
Hamilton Duel Based on an Old High School Term Paper.”
Important works we have published include Robert Wexelblatt's
pseudo-academic ""A Keynote Address by Sidney Fein,"" John D'Amico's
fictionalized ""Letter from Michel Foucault to Daniel Defert,"" and
Joseph Michael's imaginative biography ""Michiko Kakutani and the Sadness
of the World!"" We're also proud of smart fiction such as Emily Culliton's
""A Season of Meat Pie Selling"" and Charles Lowe's ""A Flowered
Rag,"" as well as hybrid poetry/memoir works such as Leora Fridman's
""Expertise"" and some of the first published English translations of the
work of Swiss-French poet Philippe Jaccottet.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

You might ask why the world needs another fantasy novel.  I can promise you that a story like mine, with an unconventional heroine, omnipresent nerdiness, and a body-positive, feminist message, is unlike anything you'll ever read.  It is the first book in a trilogy as well, so there will be more entertainment to come!  I'm not looking to change the world (yet).  I just want a chance to put my ideas out into the world and show people something different.

    Other Ways You Can Help
I completely understand that a financial commitment is not feasible for many people.  Here are some other options if you can't give but you still want to help:
Let me read to you.  I need LOTS of practice reading my elevator pitch and a 5 minute sample (apparently I have developed stage fright).  If you are far away but still want to give this a go we can always skype.

<h3>Poetic Matrix Press</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.poeticmatrix.com/about.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Poetic Matrix Press</a> was founded as a periodic poetry newsletter in 1997 in Yosemite Valley, and since 2003 has published over 40 books of poetry, along with a few memoirs and special projects.</p>
<p>As a small press (a very small press) we don't have a lot of capital to throw around, but we do have the ability to try new things. That's why we started using digital printing in order to have a more flexible print run. Now we're trying to make this Fully Funded model work. If we can raise the money to produce a book up front, we can focus more on the quality of the manuscript and the community who will enjoy it, rather than whether or not to send it to a distributor or how we can sell it, or whether it's worth publishing from a sales standpoint. Because really, we want to publish some poetry.</p>

<h2>The Books</h2>
<h3>Spangling Darkness, by Raphael Block</h3>
<h3><img alt=""Raphael Block"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/930946/pictures/full/20130715134454-Block.jpg?1373921097"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></h3>
<p>Raphael Block has lived on three continents, and now observes and responds to nature, including human nature, around his home in Northern California. In the words of J. Glenn Evans, his “poems ignite the imagination for a new vision that allows the earth to mend. This is the gift of Raphael Block as a poet whose spirit resonates in our common humanity and binds us together.” The book also features eight very fine drawings by British artist Clare Allen.</p>
<p><em>Spangling Darkness</em> will include an album of all the poems recorded by the author, available for download from our website or mailed to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Malala, by Lyn Lifshin</h3>
<p><img alt=""Lyn Lifshin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/930945/pictures/full/20130715134431-Lifshin.jpg?1373921073"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;""/>Lyn Lifshin is a veteran of small-press poetry, known for her bare, direct style and quick poetic responses to events in the world. Poetic Matrix published her book <a href=""http://www.poeticmatrix.com/title/lifshin.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Katrina</a> in 2010, 5 years after the disastrous hurricane in Louisiana. Her new manuscript, <em>Malala</em>, was inspired by the story of Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Pakistani Taliban for her work promoting girl's education, and who has since recovered at a hospital in Britain.</p>
<p>A portion of the proceeds from <em>Malala </em>will be donated to a foundation supporting Malala's cause. We're currently researching which foundation to choose.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Landscape of Hummingbird and Woman, by Joseph Milosch<img alt=""Joe Milosch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/930947/pictures/full/20130715134513-Milosch.jpg?1373921120"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;""/>
</h3>
<p>Joe Milosch received an MFA in 1995, and also spent a career as a road contractor and inspector. Poetic Matrix published his book <a href=""http://www.poeticmatrix.com/title/milosch.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Lost Pilgrimage Poems</a> in 2005. His manuscript <em>Landscape of</em> <em>Hummingbird and Woman</em> reflects on the building of a life through work and human intimacy, using the flowing language of a trained and skilled poet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p>We're raising $12,000 to publish these books, which will cover all of the costs of design and editing, an initial print run of 200 books, and advertising and prize submission. Work on the books will begin when the funding goal is reached, and the books will be complete and ready to ship 2-3 months after the campaign is complete.</p>
<p>We've also teamed up with Arizona-based artist <a href=""http://www.rghayati.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patrick Fisher</a> to produce a limited-run hand-printed broadside for each of the books. We've worked with Patrick before – he designed the cover image for Joel Netsky's 2007 book <a href=""http://www.poeticmatrix.com/title/netsky.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Uniquivocality of a Rose</a>, and he also designed the promotional images for this campaign. We love Patrick's work – we're excited to see what he designs.</p>
<p>We're referring to this as our Summer 2013 Season of Poetry. We're planning on doing 2 or 3 Seasonal campaigns per year, in order to continue publishing new and thoughtful works.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>As we mentioned, the books will be ready a few months after the end of the campaign – so we can expect to see them on our website and in your hands by October or November. The broadsides will be done much sooner than that, but the exact timeframe won't be set for another few weeks. Everything will be available on our (forthcoming) website store, and the books will be listed with our distributor, <a href=""http://www.spdbooks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Small Press Distribution</a>.</p>
<p>And what if we don't make our goal? Well, we're pretty sure we can, but even if we fall short we still want to publish – we'll be working with our authors to put together other fundraising possibilities  until everything is financed and the books go forward. We love publishing poetry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
<p>First, donate! We have great thank-you gifts, and the chance to support really exciting contemporary poetry. Secondly, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Poetic-Matrix-Press/325686277526807"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">like us on Facebook</a>, and let your friends on there and elsewhere know about the campaign. We're trying to build a broad community of poetry lovers. Third, check back in – we'll be uploading audio of the poets reading their work, as well as updates on the designs of the broadsides, and selections from the three books. Finally, check out our recently-redesigned <a href=""http://www.poeticmatrix.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. We've got a blog for new poetry – feel free to submit – as well as one focused on discussion of the poetic experience and the role of poets in the social, political, and cultural arena.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After publishing the four book Sci Fi series Socialite 1 last year I began writing two books simultaneously, a mystery called Good Gladys and a science fiction novel called Followers. When people ask me what I am writing and I tell them, they usually say either ""I would love to read the mystery"" or ""tell me when the scifi is done."" </p>
<p>People know what they like! So I am giving readers a chance to decide which book I complete and publish first.</p>
<p>Choose between:</p>
<p><strong>Good Gladys:</strong> </p>
<p>A traditional mystery with murder, sexual tension, two main suspects, and a reluctant private investigator. The world famous mystic Good Gladys is missing after her business manager is murdered, and the police have their suspect in custody. Gladys's daughter asks an old boyfriend, the PI Byrne Aase (aka Sauce) to find the real murderer: she claims the man on trial for the murder is her mother having been transformed into a man during a seance that went awry.</p>
<p><strong>Followers</strong>:</p>
<p>Science fiction with continuous action, vivid characters and an alien threat to the planet. Alien technology crash lands on Earth and races through a suburban neighbourhood. All humans and animals who cross its path are turned into zombies, intent on following the craft. A teenage girl, in an act of desperation to save her now zombie mother, manages to stop the craft, but in the process becomes the new target of the ""Followers."" </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How the winner will be chosen?</h3>
<p>When you contribute, tell me which book you prefer. The book that received the most money by the end of the campaign will be the first to be completed. It's that simple. If more money is raised from people who prefer scifi, then Followers will be the first to be completed and published. If people contribute more money for ""mystery"" then Good Gladys will be first.</p>
<p>The funds will help with the writing, editing, publishing and marketing. If enough funds are contributed to support the production of both novels, the first one will still be the book that raised the most money.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I was looking for agents to represent the Socialite series I was shocked at how many rejected it because it wasn't another teen vampire series. ""How many of these do we need?"" I wondered. ""And do people really want more of them?"" </p>
<p>This campaign lets you decide what you DO want more of: Mystery or Science Fiction. </p>
<p>Every dollar amount that is contributed to one book or the other will be included in the tally for each genre. To contribute, you can choose the perks that I have listed on the right of this page and get the finished project as soon as it is ready. Indiegogo also allows you to contribute any dollar amount that you want on the payment page, so even if you only want to give $1 or $5 you can!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but they can still help the campaign:</p>
<p>Tell your friends about the campaign. Most of us know someone who is really into mystery novels, or science fiction. Let them know that they can decide which one gets developed first.</p>
<p>Use the share tools provided at Indiegogo, or post the link to this campaign on Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<h3>Thanks to everyone who helps</h3>
<p>I am grateful for all of the help in getting one or both of these projects completed.</p>

When you contribute, tell me which book you prefer. The book that received the most money by the end of the campaign will be the first to be completed. It's that simple. If more money is raised from people who prefer scifi, then Followers will be the first to be completed and published. If people contribute more money for ""mystery"" then Good Gladys will be first.
The funds will help with the writing, editing, publishing and marketing. If enough funds are contributed to support the production of both novels, the first one will still be the book that raised the most money.


The Impact
When I was looking for agents to represent the Socialite series I was shocked at how many rejected it because it wasn't another teen vampire series. ""How many of these do we need?"" I wondered. ""And do people really want more of them?"" 
This campaign lets you decide what you DO want more of: Mystery or Science Fiction. 
Every dollar amount that is contributed to one book or the other will be included in the tally for each genre. To contribute, you can choose the perks that I have listed on the right of this page and get the finished project as soon as it is ready. Indiegogo also allows you to contribute any dollar amount that you want on the payment page, so even if you only want to give $1 or $5 you can!


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but they can still help the campaign:
Tell your friends about the campaign. Most of us know someone who is really into mystery novels, or science fiction. Let them know that they can decide which one gets developed first.
Use the share tools provided at Indiegogo, or post the link to this campaign on Twitter and Facebook.
 
Thanks to everyone who helps
I am grateful for all of the help in getting one or both of these projects completed.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Here's what it is!

VOX POP, ASC.
Today’s polling practices seem unfair. Big dollar companies and 
politicians pay for the results they are looking for. What we saw that we 
didn’t like:
-  Relatively small cross sections within a limited geographic space 
which are meant to represent the opinions of such a diverse

-  Pollsters word a question in such a way to receive the desired 
response.
Our goal is to provide non-biased, non-partisan polling. Our agenda is 
not in the answers we want to see. In fact, we don’t care what the 
answers are. Our goal is simply to get the true vox populi heard.
Additionally, unlike many polls and surveys, we are not interested in 
demographics. Our view on demographic information is that it serves 
only those interested in pandering. We are all Americans! 
We plan to: 
1. Register and verify users by voting precinct. We will need to start one 
precinct at a time and grow our service so that we get a large cross 
section of each precinct. We hope to ultimately serve all 50 states.
2. Educate participants about factors we want to discourage such as

3.Then we will send out 5 question short polls each month by mail,

</p><h1>UPDATE!!</h1><p>It is with great joy that I report our goal successfully met! To everyone out there that helped me reach this goal, thank you so very very much! <br/></p><p>Now, as promised, I have recorded a video of the first chapter of the Twelve Cataclysms for your pleasure. Sadly, it appears I can only upload one video to this site, so below, there is a link. Take 20 minutes and listen in on what happens next. <br/></p><p>If we are able to reach and extra $1000 in the next day, I will do yet another video, of the second chapter!</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/94746232"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/94746232</a><br/></p><h1><br/></h1><h1><b>The 12
Cataclysms</b></h1>
<p>When the cat burglar, Vie, sneaks into the Apocryptein she
gets far more than she bargained for when the 12 Cataclysms are released.</p>
<p>The first in a series of Fantasy novels, 12 Cataclysms is
the debut novel of Rob Queen and will be published via Amazon’s CreateSpace in
June 2014.</p>
<h3><b>Who is Rob
Queen, anyway?</b></h3>
<p>He is a male human currently residing in Boston, MA. There
is a video above that shows what he looks like and how goofy he sounds on video.
</p>
<p>Oh, that is not enough? Ok. He spent altogether too much
time in his youth reading comic books, watching cartoons, and riding horses.
The best thing to come from all that was a love of communication in all its
forms, and more specifically, a passion for all manner of story-telling. If you
like to have vivid images within the excitement of story-telling, his stories
are a good choice for you. Graduating from Skidmore College with a BA in
Creative Writing, he has long wanted to write a novel or thirty. While not his
first written, this will be the first one published. </p>
<h3><b>The Goal</b></h3>
<p>The reason Rob is posting this project is to seek out aid in
completing certain aspects of this publishing process that he cannot do by
himself. Just about everything book related has or will be done already – three
drafts have been completed and are currently being tested by Beta Readers, then
the manuscript will be edited, the type will be finalized, the layout will be
done with help from his meticulous eye, an eye-catching cover will be
commissioned, and then the book will be done. </p>
<p>So why does Mr. Queen need money? Who doesn’t? Ha!</p>
<p>I jest. Your contribution will be used in one of five ways.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To finance the aforementioned commissioned cover
art and design</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Fees from Amazon, obtaining the ISBN number,
registration and copyrighting fees.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>For hard copies of the book that he will then
use to distribute either to local bookstores or at conventions and other events
where he will sell the 12 Cataclysms.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To get your perks to you.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The lion’s share will then be queued for
marketing. While I have learned about grassroots word-of-mouth from a certain
Vermont-hailing band that I have been following for the past too long, I would
like to get in as many avenues of marketing out there. In other words, while I
would love you to pass around the 12 Cataclysms to all your friends, neighbors,
family, pets, and familiars, I would like to make this viral. To do that, I cannot
put all my eggs in one advertising/ marketing basket. </p>
<h3><b>Grassroots</b></h3>
<p>How are we usually convinced to try something new? By a
flashy advertisement? By some ogre beating you over the head with it? Or by
having a really good friend grab you by the shoulders and scream in your face
that “OMG!!! You have to try this!” While my friends and family are far more
subtle than the latter, that is basically how I choose to try new things. Sure,
you get the occasional situation where you just want to try something new, but
you have to be in the right place at the right time for that, and let us be
honest, who has such patience? </p>

what happens next. Go to your dog and bark at her to tell all her chums. Give a

<br/><p></p></div>","UPDATE!!It is with great joy that I report our goal successfully met! To everyone out there that helped me reach this goal, thank you so very very much! Now, as promised, I have recorded a video of the first chapter of the Twelve Cataclysms for your pleasure. Sadly, it appears I can only upload one video to this site, so below, there is a link. Take 20 minutes and listen in on what happens next. If we are able to reach and extra $1000 in the next day, I will do yet another video, of the second chapter!Enjoy.https://vimeo.com/94746232The 12
Cataclysms
When the cat burglar, Vie, sneaks into the Apocryptein she
gets far more than she bargained for when the 12 Cataclysms are released.
The first in a series of Fantasy novels, 12 Cataclysms is
the debut novel of Rob Queen and will be published via Amazon’s CreateSpace in
June 2014.
Who is Rob
Queen, anyway?
He is a male human currently residing in Boston, MA. There
is a video above that shows what he looks like and how goofy he sounds on video.

Oh, that is not enough? Ok. He spent altogether too much
time in his youth reading comic books, watching cartoons, and riding horses.
The best thing to come from all that was a love of communication in all its
forms, and more specifically, a passion for all manner of story-telling. If you
like to have vivid images within the excitement of story-telling, his stories
are a good choice for you. Graduating from Skidmore College with a BA in
Creative Writing, he has long wanted to write a novel or thirty. While not his
first written, this will be the first one published. 
The Goal
The reason Rob is posting this project is to seek out aid in
completing certain aspects of this publishing process that he cannot do by
himself. Just about everything book related has or will be done already – three
drafts have been completed and are currently being tested by Beta Readers, then
the manuscript will be edited, the type will be finalized, the layout will be
done with help from his meticulous eye, an eye-catching cover will be
commissioned, and then the book will be done. 
So why does Mr. Queen need money? Who doesn’t? Ha!
I jest. Your contribution will be used in one of five ways.
· 
To finance the aforementioned commissioned cover
art and design
· 
Fees from Amazon, obtaining the ISBN number,
registration and copyrighting fees.
· 
For hard copies of the book that he will then
use to distribute either to local bookstores or at conventions and other events
where he will sell the 12 Cataclysms.
· 
To get your perks to you.
· 
The lion’s share will then be queued for
marketing. While I have learned about grassroots word-of-mouth from a certain
Vermont-hailing band that I have been following for the past too long, I would
like to get in as many avenues of marketing out there. In other words, while I
would love you to pass around the 12 Cataclysms to all your friends, neighbors,
family, pets, and familiars, I would like to make this viral. To do that, I cannot
put all my eggs in one advertising/ marketing basket. 
Grassroots
How are we usually convinced to try something new? By a
flashy advertisement? By some ogre beating you over the head with it? Or by
having a really good friend grab you by the shoulders and scream in your face
that “OMG!!! You have to try this!” While my friends and family are far more
subtle than the latter, that is basically how I choose to try new things. Sure,
you get the occasional situation where you just want to try something new, but
you have to be in the right place at the right time for that, and let us be
honest, who has such patience? 
That is why I am appealing to you to contribute in as
important a manner as that of financial donation. Tell your friends and family
about this project. Tell them that you have been sucked in by the opening line
(repeated in the video and in the lines below) and you desperately need to hear
what happens next. Go to your dog and bark at her to tell all her chums. Give a
carrot to your horse and have them stay awake all night neighing this message
across the show grounds. Call your mothers, father, uncles, and aunts and tell
them that you want this to succeed.
However you want to help, I am thanking you from the bottom
of my heart.

This fresh and innovative addition to the magazine industry is an idea that we've been working on for more than 3 years, and we are finally ready to go for it. Everything is in place and all our systems are ready to start running, we just need a little help from our friends.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My name is Ronald Doyle, and this is my idea:
<h2>Four Kicks: a magazine</h2>
<p>Four Kicks will be a casual, informative and well-written magazine. We will not compete directly with any other magazines as our approach is completely different.</p>
<p>A strong personal network will be established between our readers and us. We are getting rid of publishers and distributors, so the only ones involved will be THE READERS and THE FOUR KICKS TEAM. </p>
<p>We will deliver the magazine directly to you and it will be available at the places you already visit.. for <strong>FREE.</strong> Your favourite bars, coffee shops, clothing shops and restaurants will be where you can get your hands on a copy.</p>
<p>The personal network created between our readers and us will be the essence of this magazine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>For now our content will focus on music, travelling, photography and our community.</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>The South African Music Industry has been void of the recognition it deserves. The live music scene is alive and well, and our aim is to document these events.</p>
<p>We will focus on South African music that has not been featured, music that was never heard of but is some of the best music out there.</p>
<p>We will also use the magazine as a platform for unknown artists and musicians to showcase their talents. On our website we will have a feature called 'Unknown Artists' where anyone can upload their music. The best will be chosen and compiled onto a 6-10 track CD, which will be included with the monthly edition of the magazine. </p>
<p>We will also feature pieces on the most creative local bands on the scene right now.</p>
<p>Music is what it is about... </p>
<h3>Travelling</h3>
<p>Our travelling features will be detailed pieces, covering all the aspects of these adventures. We will inform you on where to go, what to do, what to pack and which road to take. We want to motivate our readers to get out there and explore this beautiful country to its fullest!</p>
<p>Cities - Every issue will feature a piece on one of the 8 major cities in South Africa. We will focus on the current vibe and feel of that specific city. </p>
<p>Towns - Every issue will also feature a small town that you just simply have to check out. Detailed info about this town will be available.</p>
<p>Road Trips - We will take you from point A to B. A detailed road trip plan will be provided, including the amount of kilometers you will cover, the gas you'll use, where to stop and what to look out for. A detailed road trip plan will be available in every issue.</p>
<p>Break-Away - If you want to get away for the weekend, or spend 2 weeks where no one can reach you, we will give you the best break-away destinations in South Africa.  </p>
<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>A picture tells a thousand words.</p>
<p>We will have world class photographers filling our pages with spreads of pictures, giving them a chance to tell a story with their photos.</p>
<p>We will also feature photo essays and  have a data base where SA photographers can upload photos onto. We want to give them an opportunity to get their photos out there, who knows who will see them.... </p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>If we have the privilege to run our own magazine, we really do want to give something back to the community. That's why we have the ""Unknown Artists"" feature at our music section.</p>
<p>We will also give struggling SA photographers and journalists a chance to get into the industry.</p>
<p>Also, we will be printing our magazine on recycled paper. This will lower our printing costs, give an unique look and feel to the magazine, and maybe help save a few trees!!</p>
<p>Our biggest project will be helping an under-privileged scholar, giving him or her the opportunity to obtain a degree. We will co-operate with a top South African University and every year grant a under-privileged Grade 12 learner a full bursary at this top South African University.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>Our goal is $ 25 000!! This money will be spent on the following expences:</p>
<h3>Printing</h3>
<p>70% of this $ 25 000 will be spent on printing. We know online magazines are pretty big right now, but the feel of the magazine in our hands is priceless. We want our readers to take the mag with them wherever they go. This will also create a stronger personal connection with our readers, and that is what it is all about.</p>
<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>We will be distributing our magazine ourselves, staying connected with the network we will create. We want to be part of every single step in the process.</p>
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>Websites are where it is at these days. We want to spend a few bucks on this to make sure we get the coolest possible website ready for everyone to use. We will also ensure that it is the most user friendly website out there.</p>
<h3>Launch Tour</h3>
<p>We want to kick off our campaign in the best possible way, so... a jam packed launch tour will take place. 8 Cities, 8 shows, 3 bands per show and the only place where you can get your hands on the first issue. A successful launch tour will go a long way to help us establish a connection with our readers. </p>
<h2>Fresh Approaches</h2>
<p>Like you already know, we want to do a few things differently! We will distribute our magazine ourselves, it will be available at the places our customers already go to, and it will be absolutely free..</p>
<h2>FREE?</h2>
<p>Yes, this magazine is completely free, and it will always be available for free. Research has shown that companies advertize 30% more in a free product. </p>
<p>It's important to realize that it is a different approach than handing out flyers at a traffic light. The type of free we are talking about still carry a lot of value and to get our hands on one of these free copies, will create an exclusive feeling!! </p>
<h3>Be sure to go through all the perks, I know there's one just for you...</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a lot of fun making this video, and please watch it again, but know this: We have never been more serious and ready for anything in our lives. This is what we are here to do, please give us the opportunity to go for it</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>
<p>Originally born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I was raised in San Diego, California where I attended Lemon Grove Middle School and graduated from Mount Miguel High School. I am a graduate of Spelman College where I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Child Development. While at Spelman, I joined a community service organization called Sister’s Keeping It Real Through Service, Incorporated where I directed a mentoring program for girls in elementary and middle school. My time with these girls affirmed what I already recognized as a need for positive images of brown women in and around our communities. Since graduating from Spelman in 2009, I have worked as an elementary school teacher in Georgia's both public and charter school sectors. During my time in the classroom, my love for reading and acting out stories for my students sparked a light in me to begin developing my own children's book series. There is a great need for diversity in children’s literature and in children’s entertainment, which inspired me to create Ebony Pearl’s World. As a child, when I found the perfect book series, I would let my imagination run wild. I was most intrigued by books that had characters who looked like me. Ebony Pearl is a character that brown girls can relate to because when they look at her, they see a reflection of themselves.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get'</h3>
<div>We need your help raising money to self-publish the book, Ebony Pearl's Friends: Beautifully Brown. The book will be illustrated by a fellow Spelman Alumna, Courtney Anderson, who will bring this story to life with her creative and vibrant drawing talents. Another Spelman Alumna, Latriecia Brown is also a major part of bringing this vision to life. We have come together to have a positive impact on young girls in our community. The self-publishing option will allow me the freedom to keep my own team of Spelman sisters during the development of this book. It will also allow me to continuously develop Ebony Pearl's character while still maintaining it's authenticity. In self publishing, the creator of the book is responsible for 100% of the printing and distribution costs. The creator is also repsonsible for purchasing an ISBN number as well as for any taxes and fees associated with the creation of the book. With your support, we can raise enough funds to cover all of  these costs. I would also like to use a portion of the funds to transform the Ebony Pearl's World website into an interactive website where Ebony Pearl fans can learn and have fun. <p></p>
<p>Now here's the fun part! Let's talk perks! While, there is truly no way to fully express the magnitude of my gratitude for your support, I would still like to to recognize you with sincere appreciation. There are a variety of contribution options and what you get in return are some very cool perks! They range from a heartfelt thank you directly from Ebony Pearl, to your name being highlighted on the Ebony Pearl's World facebook fan page, or to you receiving a printed copy of the actual book! We want to recognize you in a special way for supporting our campaign!</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>With so many campaigns out there, here's why Ebony Pearl's World really needs your support. The mission of Ebony Pearl’s World is to empower young girls of color to feel confident, beautiful, and to truly love and embrace their beautiful shades of brown skin. In many of our families, when looking at our mothers, sisters and daughters, we see many different shades of brown represented. Sometimes the conversation about skin is not so easy. The book relays this message in a fun and unique way that young girls can enjoy. We seek to make the conversation among families a little easier. Along with empowering girls of color comes the thought of love and acceptance of all girls globally. In the well known poem, ""Our Greatest Fear"" by Marianne Williamson, she wrote “And as we let our own light shine,  we subconsciously give other people  permission to do the same.” While this series fosters the empowerment of brown girls throughout the world, in teaching young girls of color to love themselves, we teach them not to be defined by standards of beauty that do not reflect them, but rather to create their own standards of beauty. In allowing brown girls to let their light shine, they subconsciously find acceptance of cultural diversity. The Ebony Pearl series not only teaches young African-American girls to love their own brown beauty, but also the beauty that can be found in multicultural sisterhood. As each story in this series continues to develop, characters from a variety of backgrounds are connected through the experiences they share with their friend Ebony Pearl. The goal is to inspire every girl who picks up an Ebony Pearl book to feel beautiful!</p>
<p>You can be apart of this journey! Just think about one little brown girl you know and picture her being inspired to love her skin. The impact your contribution will have on the mission to of empowering girls of color will not only promote self love, but it will also promote the love and acceptance of others.The thought of one girl being inspired by the Ebony Pearl character is all it takes to fuel my ambition for this initiative. With your support, you will have played a significant role in a cause that will inspire girls all over. Thank you!<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So you love this campaign and wish you could give financially, but you are unable to at this time? You can still help out in a major way! Make some noise about Ebony Pearl's World and the book by clicking ""like"", ""share"", and ""send"" on all of your social media outlets including email. You can also utilize the indiegogo share tools found on this website. Thank you so much for your support!</p>

While most people believe these are just tales, we have found out that the tales have at least some basis in fact.

Sometimes, this boundary is thin enough that something from the other side can get through the barrier. At other times, the barrier thins, and the fears and dreams of the people nearby allow their deepest fears to manifest in our reality. We call these crossings ‘Incursions’.

</div></div>","Agent Smith cleared his throat and began:     “Throughout history, there have been stories and reports of strange animals, evil creatures and unexplained phenomena. While most people believe these are just tales, we have found out that the tales have at least some basis in fact. As best we can tell, there are certain spots where the boundary between our reality and another reality, another plane of existence, or another place grows thin and weak. Sometimes, this boundary is thin enough that something from the other side can get through the barrier. At other times, the barrier thins, and the fears and dreams of the people nearby allow their deepest fears to manifest in our reality. We call these crossings ‘Incursions’. ""- Excerpt from Incursion: Knightmare by Bryan Donihue
My name is Bryan Donihue, and I'm an author, speaker, trainer, artist, and entrepreneur. I am the founder of a company called Sheepdog Development, dedicated to teaching churches and parents how to keep kids safe. I am also a founding partner in a company that offers training and consulting for small and mid-sized business, called Business Success Enterprises.
I am an avid reader and long-time writer. Before 2014, I had never really thought about publishing any of my work. Last year, I decided to self-publish my first book, a non-fiction book called What They Don't Tell You About Church Safety. Earlier this year, I co-wrote a second non-fiction book called Ready, Set, Connect!  for professional photographers.
I am also a long-time gamer and game designer. Years ago, some friends and I started working on designing a roleplaying game. For years, we worked on various games and systems, wanting to build a unique system and storyline, with the eventual goal of publishing. Although that never came to fruition, the lessons learned helped us start a new chapter, closing that door and beginning a new, tighter game, which we are internally testing right now.
This modern-day horror game spawned an idea for a novel - this novel. Incursion: Knightmare is about a secret government team that hunts monsters.

<p>Our teen journalists get paid for the work they do and learn valuable life and work skills while they are at it. Listen to what they have to say:</p>
<blockquote>“Teenagers don’t think their voices matter anywhere, so when you call them up and start telling them their every-day experiences matter enough to be written about, I think a change happens.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Any of the issues that I am looking forward to writing about for Teen Voices stem from problems I’ve faced and seen in my own community, and Teen Voices has allowed me to speak about them.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’ve started to realize that being a journalist could be a reality for me.” </blockquote>
<p>On top of this, our partnerships with girl-serving organizations allow us to showcase the authentic voices and experiences of girls from such places as Kenya, Afghanistan, Chicago, L.A., Detroit, and Toronto.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","It’s hard being a teen girl. They have intense pressure to succeed and limited opportunities to affect legislation. People are always talking about them or at them. And rarely are they asked for their thoughts. That’s all changing with Teen Voices at Women’s eNews. As a global girl news site we give young women the opportunity to be involved in creating news about their lives and influencing international news coverage, cultivating the next generation of social activist journalists.
Help change the media landscape by donating to our end of the year campaign. 
Formerly a print publication and mentoring program that began in Boston in 1988, Teen Voices is now an online source for international news on girls’ opinions, innovations and barriers to success. 
During our pilot year we gave 46 teens from all over the world, mentoring, training and publishing opportunities through our Virtual Newsroom and our partner content.
Each of the 50 articles we've published has added dimension to how the world sees teen girls. From understanding why there are few girls in baseball to the role of texting in teen dating, Teen Voices amplifies the hidden voices of girls. 
If you think girls have something to say give to Teen Voices. 
Show girls you want to hear what they have to say. Teen Voices #BeHeard. 

   What We Need & What You Get 
We need to raise $5,000 to meet our goals for the year and ensure a healthy start in 2015. With your help we can continue to deliver news like this:


Happily, Teen Lifeguards Say It's Not 'Baywatch' By Karly Matthews





Babysitters Find Gender Gap at Starting Gateby Alexea Hankin





Baseball Champ Mo'ne Davis Is Tough Act to Follow            By Angela Roberts





Teens Say School Sex Harassment Goes Unpunished             By Nicole Deniflee and Tatyana Bellamy-Walker 




Teen Voices is a journalism training program. We amplify the voices of young women around the world and provide a platform for teens to share news about their lives through these three initiatives:

Teen Voices Virtual Newsroom: Teen journalists are paid to report on news assigned by Teen Voices at Women’s eNews editors. 
Global Partnerships: Collaborations with global organizations and schools permit girls from all over the world to receive training on how to effectively communicate their messages while we also provide them with an international stage to spotlight their work.
A Seat at the Table: This series partners women and teens for a self-moderated, recorded intergenerational conversation on leadership and feminism. Segments are shot and edited by paid teen videographers.      To put it simply, we are helping young women around the world to #BeHeard!

The Impact 
Our teen journalists get paid for the work they do and learn valuable life and work skills while they are at it. Listen to what they have to say:
“Teenagers don’t think their voices matter anywhere, so when you call them up and start telling them their every-day experiences matter enough to be written about, I think a change happens.”
“Any of the issues that I am looking forward to writing about for Teen Voices stem from problems I’ve faced and seen in my own community, and Teen Voices has allowed me to speak about them.”
“I’ve started to realize that being a journalist could be a reality for me.” 
On top of this, our partnerships with girl-serving organizations allow us to showcase the authentic voices and experiences of girls from such places as Kenya, Afghanistan, Chicago, L.A., Detroit, and Toronto.

<h3></h3>
<p>My name is Alain Miguelez. I'm an urban planner and an amateur historian. I love my city, and I love researching its history. I've written a book titled <i><b>Transforming Ottawa: Canada's Capital in the Eyes of Jacques Gréber</b></i>. This book was inspired by the rediscovery, at the National Archives, of a large collection of hauntingly beautiful street scenes of Ottawa in 1937-39, commissioned by Jacques Gréber, the French urban planner hired by the Prime Minister of the day (W.L. Mackenzie King) to prepare a master plan for our city. The book looks at the city as Gréber saw it in 1937, when he first set foot in Ottawa, describes his famous 1950 plan, and discusses its outcomes and effects on our city.</p>
<p>If you live in Ottawa, chances are you’ve heard of the <b>Gréber Plan</b>. Now 65 years old, this blueprint for our city was almost entirely implemented over the decades and, in many ways, has defined the city as we know it today. But what did Ottawa look like before the Gréber Plan? What did that Plan see as the city’s burning problems, and how did it propose to resolve them? In hindsight, how did the solutions play out? </p>
<p>The book contains about 300 of these incredibly sharp and crisp black-and-white Ottawa street scenes from the late 1930's, in high resolution. You will see photos of streets and corners that are now unrecognizable, and some that have stayed amazingly identical to how they looked 75 years ago.<br/></p>
<p>This crowd-funding campaign is to allow me to publish this book professionally, have it designed to be a beautiful work of art, and price it for as wide a readership as possible. The book itself is intended as a contribution to the ongoing conversation about our growing city, its planning history, and its present-day challenges. I feel that it's important to know where we've been in order to better map out the future. Especially these days, with all the exciting projects that are taking place in Ottawa, the much stronger sense of civic identity emerging in our city, and the genuine interest in the stories and legends of our past, this book is intended to become a reference about the pivotal 1950 master plan by Jacques Gréber that changed the face of our city in a number of ways.</p>
<p>I intend to publish this book by the end of 2015 (it will be available in time for Christmas and will make a great gift for all those who are interested in our city's history!). </p>
<p>This is my second book - in 2004, I published <em>""A Theatre Near You: 150 years of going to the show in Ottawa-Gatineau"",</em> a history of Ottawa-Gatineau theatres.</p>
<p>I am grateful for all contributions, and also very thankful to those who post, share, tweet or tell their friends and family about this crowd-funding.</p>

<h3>Why This Project Matters<br/>
</h3>
<p>This art project has personal significance for me. Without going into excruciating detail, this year I have battled severe depression for the first time in my life as a result of facing rejection because of who I am, and because I would not change to suit others. It's been physically and emotionally taxing, and has been complicated by my planned impending hysterectomy to treat/prevent endometriosis and uterine fibroids. I felt exiled and alone because of my chronic pain and unconventional choices. My goal is to create something productive and beautiful out of my hurt, and demonstrate through this series that just because something is uncommon or misunderstood doesn't make it wrong or devoid of worth. What I hope to convey through these images would be the inherent value and beauty of variety, even if it means a person doesn't fit in with society's expectations.<br/></p>

<p>Hello! This is Tiffany Mason and I am excited to announce the release of my first book - <i>The Power of Adversity - A Guide to Finding Your Greatest Gift in Life.  </i>Over the past few years, I have listened as dozens of women shared their personal struggles with me about their closest relationships, struggles for work/life balance, raising children and other important issues.  </p>
<p>As I began to reflect on those many conversations, the desire to share my story and work with as many women as I could kept growing.  That is why I decided to write <i>The Power of Adversity - A Guide to Finding Your Greatest Gift in Life.</i></p><p><b>---------------------</b></p>
<p>Throughout my youth I was living a dream.  As a professional entertainer, I performed in front of large audiences, traveled to competitions and participated in beauty pageants.  I looked forward to a future full of possibilities in the entertainment world.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/455694/files/20140324051851-Pegeant3.jpg?1395663531"" src="""" style=""width: 305.40983606557376px; height: 230px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/455696/files/20140324052032-Pageant.jpg?1395663632"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 252.7941176470588px; height: 191px;""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/455698/files/20140324052133-Pegeant4.jpg?1395663693"" src="""" style=""width: 171.05846153846153px; height: 418px;""/>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/456858/files/20140324133547-321551_2482049535287_2116002618_n.jpg?1395693347"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 269.94202898550725px; height: 417px;""/></p><p></p><b>--------------------</b><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My life turned upside down when I turned 18. I was sexually molested by an older man and left completely traumatized.  My outgoing personality was gone.  I lost weight and my mood grew dark.  I kept the people who used to be close to me at a distance. </span></p>
<p><b>My journey of healing began with a vision </b>- a vision of what I wanted my life to look like.  I then passionately set out to make it a reality.  For the next five years I devoured every piece of information on development and marriage I could find.  </p>
<p>Along the way my life's passion was born:  <b>""What does it take to get a life truly worth living for?""  </b>What happened to me in my late teens does not define me but has helped shaped what I have become.  It was truly a blessing in disguise.  I am now leading the life I deserve - that <b>we all deserve</b> - one filled with purpose, passion and love.</p>
<p>You know what?  Each day I wake up and choose to make it even better, by doing things I want to do, things I am truly passionate about.</p>
<p><b>I want you to have that kind of life too.</b>  The potential is in all of us.  It was not easy, but it is worth it.</p><p><b>--------------------</b></p><p><b>Who better than someone who has overcome her own significant challenges to help you overcome yours? </b> In ""<i>The Power of Adversity - A Guide to Finding Your Greatest Gift in Life"" </i>you will learn that you have the ability to make the desires of your heart a reality.  By showing you how to use the most powerful tool at your disposal - your mind, I will walk with you as you face down and overcome your own personal adversity.  Together we will look at the importance of whom you surround yourself with, what you say to yourself and how to create your own personal philosophy. </p>

Hello! This is Tiffany Mason and I am excited to announce the release of my first book - The Power of Adversity - A Guide to Finding Your Greatest Gift in Life.  Over the past few years, I have listened as dozens of women shared their personal struggles with me about their closest relationships, struggles for work/life balance, raising children and other important issues.  
As I began to reflect on those many conversations, the desire to share my story and work with as many women as I could kept growing.  That is why I decided to write The Power of Adversity - A Guide to Finding Your Greatest Gift in Life.---------------------
Throughout my youth I was living a dream.  As a professional entertainer, I performed in front of large audiences, traveled to competitions and participated in beauty pageants.  I looked forward to a future full of possibilities in the entertainment world.      --------------------My life turned upside down when I turned 18. I was sexually molested by an older man and left completely traumatized.  My outgoing personality was gone.  I lost weight and my mood grew dark.  I kept the people who used to be close to me at a distance. 
My journey of healing began with a vision - a vision of what I wanted my life to look like.  I then passionately set out to make it a reality.  For the next five years I devoured every piece of information on development and marriage I could find.  
Along the way my life's passion was born:  ""What does it take to get a life truly worth living for?""  What happened to me in my late teens does not define me but has helped shaped what I have become.  It was truly a blessing in disguise.  I am now leading the life I deserve - that we all deserve - one filled with purpose, passion and love.
You know what?  Each day I wake up and choose to make it even better, by doing things I want to do, things I am truly passionate about.
I want you to have that kind of life too.  The potential is in all of us.  It was not easy, but it is worth it.--------------------Who better than someone who has overcome her own significant challenges to help you overcome yours?  In ""The Power of Adversity - A Guide to Finding Your Greatest Gift in Life"" you will learn that you have the ability to make the desires of your heart a reality.  By showing you how to use the most powerful tool at your disposal - your mind, I will walk with you as you face down and overcome your own personal adversity.  Together we will look at the importance of whom you surround yourself with, what you say to yourself and how to create your own personal philosophy. 
We all have habits we engage in, and the difference between people living a life of fulfillment and those who are not is the fulfilled ones created their own habits instead of accepting the ones life could have chosen for them.  Through choosing a series of behaviors and actions, we build the foundation for a fulfilled life.---------------------What your donations support? I’ve already written a complete rough draft of the book. Now, I need support in editing and publishing the book. I deeply believe that this book is a powerful message to those that have experienced a traumatic situation. This book gives hope that no matter what kind of adversity you have experienced, there is a gift awaiting for you to unwrap.This gift will be the light that will lead you to living a life filled with joy, love and the freedom to move past your adversity. Because I know in my heart that this book can inspire so many women, I want this book to be handled with excellence and quality. The money received from this campaign will go into: If you have any questions, please use this form. I look forward to reading your message! Fill out my online form on my website The Power of Precedents! ----------------------Personal Transformation:Now, at the age of 24, I’ve realized that my adversity has become a blessing in disguise. If it weren’t for this traumatic situation, I would not have become so passionate about life and marriage. This adversity allowed me to explore what is truly joyful in life.  I am now happily married to my loving husband John and have found my calling in life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Correllian-Nativist Tradition has spent 6 months gathering pagan oriented books and tools which will be shipped to the Clan of Kheper Temple, Cape Town, South Africa in April, 2013.  These include books on many different religions other than the ""Big Three"" and spiritual disciplines for readers of all ages and expertise.  </p>
<p>In S.A. a book can cost as much as two days worth of food.  In many areas of Africa being named a witch is life threatening.  Our goal is to provide a safe and nurturing environment where all seekers can explore books with a wide variety of topics and get hands on experience utilizing tools which can be checked out and used in the comfort of one's home at no cost.  One book has the potential to open up a whole new realm of spirituality and a lifetime of learning.  Help us deliver this dream and house the Inter-Faith Pagan Library of South Africa.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $2,000 goal for this campaign will provide two things.  First and foremost it will deliver the accumulated library to South Africa.  Secondly, it will purchase a Wendy House to function as the library facility.  This will enable a broader access to the gathered materials than being housed in someone's home.  The highest level perk is what is required to purchase the minimum size Wendy House to successfully function as the library. We put that perk out there in the hopes it would be claimed and that any additional funding received would be enough to not only ship the accumulated materials but to upgrade the Wendy House to accommodate a larger library collection.</p>
<p>We have perks to fit all budgets!  From our original bookmark, custom t-shirts, metaphysical stones straight from Africa including one from the personal collection of the High Priest of the Clan of Kheper Temple, Ndebele tribal dolls and commemorative plagues just select a perk that calls to you!</p>
<p>Should we not reach our entire goal of providing the Wendy House, the donated funds will be used to ship the library to South Africa and install bookshelves to house it at the High Priestess of the temple’s home.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This library includes books, CDs and tools on many of the non-book religions, not just Wicca.  We have tried to vary the content in order to serve all Pagan paths and spiritual disciplines.  The content includes non-fiction books on spirituality, rituals, magick, runes, tarot, herbs, candle magic, crystals, meditation, dream analysis, numerology, astrology, omens, natural medicines and healing, scrying, reflexology, palmistry, hand writing analysis, spirit guides and totems, Feng Shui, I-Ching, Shamanism, aura reading and so much more.  There are also pagan oriented fictional works included in the library, especially for the younger generations. </p>
<p>Donations of books, cd’s and tools have come in from around the world as the Correllian-Nativist Tradition has temples and shrines in 16 countries across the globe as well as a network of non-Correllians who work with our members every day to further the acceptance of the overall Pagan path.<br/><br/> Now the final phase of this project needs your help, the shipment to South Africa and housing of the library collection once there.  Please help at whatever level you feel called to knowing it will all make an impact on the lives of many generations of seekers in South Africa.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you feel you are unable to donate financially to this worthy project here are a few ways to support it.  Please share the link to this Indiegogo campaign on all your social media sites and e-mail your friends who might be interested in the project about it. </p>
<p>Also feel free to ship any pagan oriented books, CDs, DVDs, tarot cards, divination tools, etc. you wish to contribute to the library to be included in the April shipment to the address below.  Please DO NOT send herbs, incense, candles or perishables.  All materials must reach the below address no later than March 31<sup>st</sup> to be included in the library.  The U.S. Post Office media rate is usually the cheapest shipping alternative but it can take several weeks to arrive so ship early!</p>
<p>Address removed due to the deadline being passed.  Please check our Facebook page for a shipping address for late shipments of library materials.</p>

<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>My name is Wind, a name given to me along the way while adventuring and soul-seeking.  Many of you may know me as the muggle formerly known as Matt.  I recently completed a trek to the jungles of South America where a lot of things happened for me, including a complete transformation of my life And spirituality. </p>

<div> </div>
<div>My name is Gwen and I have been writing poetry for as long as I can remember. It's something I'm passionate about, something I get excited about. I've hoped someday to be published, even if it's just a small book of stories or poems. What better way to make it happen, then to self-publish? The thing is, though, I can't quite do it all on my own. That is where you come in! :)</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT I NEED, WHAT YOU LOVELIES GET</h3>
To my immense delight and surprise, self-publishing does not cost that much. To reach this goal, I'm looking at about $500-- that should be enough to get about 100 small books printed. With your help, I can make it happen!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, here's the fun part-- you donate, you get things!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you want to recieve a book, the minimum is a $10 donation. But you don't have to give that much! Even $5 will get you something, like a hand-written poem, or a small doodle. The more you donate, the bigger the benefits for you--like getting a portrait of your beautiful self, or a special mention in the book! So really, everyone wins.</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT THIS MEANS</h3>
Not only would you be helping me achieve a dream, but you get to be a part of a shiny, brand-new experience, a leap into the world of being a published author. You get a little part of me, a book you can hold in your hands, that's filled with my words and thoughts and ideas and I think that's pretty cool. Plus, you might also get a handwritten poem, or a drawing, or your name published, too! Far out.</div>
<h3>WHAT ELSE?</h3>
<p><br/>It's perfectly fine if you're unable to donate money. You can still be a huge help by promoting! Tell your friends and family that it's happening, share it on any number of social media websites (there's plenty to choose from). Even a small note of, like, ""Hey, good for you!"" feels amazing. Any sort of encouragement is appreciated. :D</p></div>","HEY THERE KIDS

Because, well, strokes.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Less-<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Short Summary</span>
</h3> <p>Hi, I'm MCM, and I write stuff. In the last decade, I created a TV show called <b>RollBots</b>, wrote a whole bunch of books like <b>The Pig and the Box</b>, <b>Typhoon </b>and <b>Fission Chips</b>, and tried to push the publishing envelope in crazy new directions. My newest project, <b>Shutterbugs</b>, a preschool show I co-created, is currently in production.<br/></p><p>For my next trick, I want to write a story about an insufferable bastard being insufferably bastardly... so I don't die.</p><p>Now I know what you're thinking: how can writing a story keep someone alive? Well, I've got insanely high blood pressure thanks to two awful years helping my wife recover from being hit by a car, and thanks to the abject failure of the insurance industry, I don't know how I'm going to keep the lights on for the next three months.

Because, well, strokes.Less-Short Summary
 Hi, I'm MCM, and I write stuff. In the last decade, I created a TV show called RollBots, wrote a whole bunch of books like The Pig and the Box, Typhoon and Fission Chips, and tried to push the publishing envelope in crazy new directions. My newest project, Shutterbugs, a preschool show I co-created, is currently in production.For my next trick, I want to write a story about an insufferable bastard being insufferably bastardly... so I don't die.Now I know what you're thinking: how can writing a story keep someone alive? Well, I've got insanely high blood pressure thanks to two awful years helping my wife recover from being hit by a car, and thanks to the abject failure of the insurance industry, I don't know how I'm going to keep the lights on for the next three months. Literally, even. And while my doctor thinks pills are the answer, I can tell you with some certainty that pills cost money, which to me sounds like a negative feedback loop in action. So I'm opting for the natural approach: I want to write something cathartic, with no regard for human decency, to help relieve the stress that's killing me.And thus, we have Sriracha for the Soul, a travelogue about a broken-down bastard who is sent by God to savagely belittle enough people to avert the apocalypse.

</h3><p><a href=""http://www.revistadedalo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dédalo</a> is a magazine created in 2006 by a group of students from the Faculty of Architecture of the University
of Porto (FAUP), Portugal, established as a place for critical reflection and intervention. As

each year, creating new artistic paths and crossroads, allowing for the

<p>As
an interpretative result of all the work developed throughout last year's initiatives,
it reflects upon the value and pertinence of the participatory design process
experimented by us in the area of Campanhã in Porto, Portugal, gathering the results and written contributions
of many of its participants and coordinators. It also compiles a selection
of articles that arose from the <i>call for papers</i> we have launched in the
beginning of 2013, under the motto - <i><a href=""http://www.revistadedalo.com/Briefing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Who Lives Next Door?</a></i></p>
<p>As
the closing of a chapter, we believe that it would be of great importance to
spread the conclusions and interrogations that came out of last year’s work, reflecting
the focus on a practical approach to the city, which we believe to be important
to discuss and share with you.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/578631/files/20140514035013-IMG_3649.JPG?1400064613"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR?</h3>

Dédalo is a magazine created in 2006 by a group of students from the Faculty of Architecture of the University
of Porto (FAUP), Portugal, established as a place for critical reflection and intervention. As
an editorial platform for experimentation, Dédalo is run by a different team

is now on the run to publish its 10th edition, and it needs your

As
an interpretative result of all the work developed throughout last year's initiatives,
it reflects upon the value and pertinence of the participatory design process
experimented by us in the area of Campanhã in Porto, Portugal, gathering the results and written contributions
of many of its participants and coordinators. It also compiles a selection
of articles that arose from the call for papers we have launched in the

the focus on a practical approach to the city, which we believe to be important
to discuss and share with you.WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR?
The concept
The idea behind this 10th edition was to transpose
the bridge from theoretical production to the creation and experimentation of
new methods of architectural production, taking as a starting point the area of
Corujeira, Campanhã, in the city of Porto, Portugal. Considering proximity and local interaction as key
elements for the collective reflection, decision and action, we encouraged and practiced
a direct approach to the urban space, based on the cooperation between inhabitants
and professionals, taking into consideration the necessities and desires of
those who live and adapt to the city’s structure on a daily basis. Architecture,
urbanism, design and sociology were, thus, approached and applied as political
tools of inclusion and expression, oriented for social transformation.
  The method

Through public opinion points placed in the
area of Campanhã, brief conversations with inhabitants and passers-by,
activities developed with the schools and social centres, we were able to
conduct an extensive survey on the opinions and considerations about Campanhã's public space and its future, information that was then analysed and passed on
to the team of coordinators in charge of the work developed in the urban
festival RE-ACT Campanhã.
The experience
Dédalo's urban festival RE-ACT Campanhã
combined workshops and collective debates. The workshops were coordinated by Todo
Por La Praxis (ES) and Pedro Bismarck (PT), Nuno Travasso (PT) and Studio Weave (UK), Bernardo
Amaral (PT), Failed Architecture (NL) , Ateliermob (PT) and MakerLab (DE) and Os Espacialistas (PT) and Map-It (BE), who promoted and guided
different design approaches to a common urban context, and developed 5 different projects which are, at the moment, being discussed with the city hall

<p>Greetings,
Alfred Howard here. I work at a record store, I write lyrics for 7 bands in
San Diego, I build and break my own percussion instruments and I have an abundance
of stories. I'm from New Jersey whether I want to be or not and it shaped me
into what you have here today. I've been working on this book very gradually
since 2006, it holds tales from the road of triumph and woe (mostly the latter), stories
of the quirky to full blown crazy people who shop at a record store in the
bohemian recesses of ocean beach and song lyrics. I've always struggled with the
dualism of my writing, every song I've ever written (aside from a rap song
titled ""I'm Walking Dogs Mother Fucker"") has been dead serious, and
all my prose is an amalgamation of dick jokes and incoherent ramblings
shouted at the sky. I think this book is the meeting ground between the two.
Well, I hope it is, you'll have to read it and tell me, I'm actually nervous as
all shit.</p>
<p><b>What
I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I need money.
I've always respected these crowd sourcing campaigns. I finally worked hard
enough this year at my minimum wage job that I was able to support a friend of
mine's kickstarter campaign, truth is, I owed him money and that may have been
an underhanded way of paying him back, but what are you gonna do. My basic
intention here is to sell books and gauge if all the folks who claimed to be
interested in buying one are actually interested. If I reach my goal,
realistically, I'm going to get my remaining wisdom teeth pulled cause that's
pricy and I'm going to keep writing because enough friends and family reassured
me that my efforts are worth a damn. But this is your spot to pick up a copy of
the Autobiography of No One. It's a pretty unique book. It is going to be
downloadable because I am part hippie and wasting trees for some dick jokes
seems selfish. Though I will physically press a couple. It has a soundtrack,
all the bands I perform in were kind enough to contribute some unreleased cuts
and some released ones as well. There's also some art and photography. Like any artistic endeavor I have costs to cover to make this a
reality and though I work full time, perform full time and hustle with every
waking breath, I chose the only two jobs that pay less than can collecting,
record store clerk and full time musician. So, help me do this.......  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>At this point
I'm supposed to explain why this project has value to the world. That's a
perfectly valid question and though you can't tell, I've been staring into this
computer screen for 11 hours trying to answer it. This book and the songs therein are my
perspective on the world, as much insight as I can conjure from the thinnest
sliver of earth that I inhabit. I've always thought I've had a unique vantage
point, I write the lyrics for several very divergent bands, I've logged a lot
of miles in america playing dive bars and the occasional classy joint, I
met Ed Begley Jr. once, my friend Matt touched Paul Mccartney's hand and I ate three burritos in a day without dying. I'm assuming if
you are here, you've heard one of my band's at some point and didn't hate it.
If you're the slightest bit curious about my experience behind the songs, this
is pretty much every remotely interesting thing that's happened to me since the Clinton Years.</p>

dualism of my writing, every song I've ever written (aside from a rap song
titled ""I'm Walking Dogs Mother Fucker"") has been dead serious, and
all my prose is an amalgamation of dick jokes and incoherent ramblings
shouted at the sky. I think this book is the meeting ground between the two.
Well, I hope it is, you'll have to read it and tell me, I'm actually nervous as
all shit.
What
I Need & What You Get
I need money.
I've always respected these crowd sourcing campaigns. I finally worked hard
enough this year at my minimum wage job that I was able to support a friend of
mine's kickstarter campaign, truth is, I owed him money and that may have been
an underhanded way of paying him back, but what are you gonna do. My basic
intention here is to sell books and gauge if all the folks who claimed to be
interested in buying one are actually interested. If I reach my goal,
realistically, I'm going to get my remaining wisdom teeth pulled cause that's
pricy and I'm going to keep writing because enough friends and family reassured
me that my efforts are worth a damn. But this is your spot to pick up a copy of
the Autobiography of No One. It's a pretty unique book. It is going to be
downloadable because I am part hippie and wasting trees for some dick jokes
seems selfish. Though I will physically press a couple. It has a soundtrack,
all the bands I perform in were kind enough to contribute some unreleased cuts
and some released ones as well. There's also some art and photography. Like any artistic endeavor I have costs to cover to make this a
reality and though I work full time, perform full time and hustle with every
waking breath, I chose the only two jobs that pay less than can collecting,
record store clerk and full time musician. So, help me do this.......  
The Impact
At this point
I'm supposed to explain why this project has value to the world. That's a
perfectly valid question and though you can't tell, I've been staring into this
computer screen for 11 hours trying to answer it. This book and the songs therein are my
perspective on the world, as much insight as I can conjure from the thinnest
sliver of earth that I inhabit. I've always thought I've had a unique vantage
point, I write the lyrics for several very divergent bands, I've logged a lot
of miles in america playing dive bars and the occasional classy joint, I
met Ed Begley Jr. once, my friend Matt touched Paul Mccartney's hand and I ate three burritos in a day without dying. I'm assuming if
you are here, you've heard one of my band's at some point and didn't hate it.
If you're the slightest bit curious about my experience behind the songs, this
is pretty much every remotely interesting thing that's happened to me since the Clinton Years.

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hello. I'm Todd Swindell, the editor of <i>I Am Going to Fly through Glass: The Selected Poems of Harold Norse.</i> I have organized several international events to celebrate the 100th birthday of Beat poet <a href=""http://haroldnorse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harold Norse</a> who was my friend and mentor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Growing up gay in conservative Orange County in the 1980s, Harold's poetry saved </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">my life. Since his death in 2009, I have worked passionately at preserving Harold's legacy. These poems and books relate his experience as a queer man through the 20th Century. His insight and inspiration will continue to guide a younger generation.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Born in Brooklyn July 6, 1916 to an unwedded, illiterate immigrant mother, Harold's gift for poetry gave him an incredible life of magic and hardship. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the 1940s he lived in Greenwich Village where he was friends with Allen Ginsberg, James Baldwin and Tennessee Williams. In the 1950s, he left America to live abroad for 15 years in Europe and North Africa. In Tangier he took hashish with his Moroccan boyfriend as they traveled the land sleeping on mats. In Paris he lived at the Beat Hotel cutting up words with William Burroughs. When Harold returned to America at the close of the 1960s, he settled in San Francisco where he wrote poems about gay liberation.</span></p>
<p>You only turn 100 once and I aim to make the most of this milestone. To raise funds, I am organizing an online book sale of Harold's rare, out of print works. Dedicated to his craft, Harold learned to live on simple means. Copies of his books were one thing he could offer to people. It was Harold's wish that his books be used to continue his legacy of poetry which shines light into the darkness of these times.</p>

I'm presenting <a href=""https://ebsn.eu/2016-conference-manchester-uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two talks</a> about Harold Norse. The EBSN conference is a prime opportunity to network with scholars and students of Beat literature to make them aware of Harold's work. Additionally I'll attend and document numerous presentations with report back about the events at <a href=""http://haroldnorse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">haroldnorse.com</a> and other social media platforms.<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

</li></ul>
<i style=""font-size: 16px;"">""Over the past few years, Harold Norse has become one of my favorite Beat poets, but it wasn't until I received his collected, </i><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">In the Hub of the Fiery Force</span><i style=""font-size: 16px;"">, that I knew for sure. The use of subtitles is representative of homosexuals at the time having to be secretive of their love and seek it out of the public eye, or risk damnation. I love the contrast of Norse's sexual honesty with his solemn bit of advice, stating that homosexuals can essentially only exist if they keep the truth hidden, which demonstrates the extreme difficulty of living a lie when we, as humans, are so driven to freely pursue love and sexuality. And even though the world has grown more accepting over time, it still hasn't grown enough.""</i><br/><ul>

</div></div>","Beat Poet Harold Norse Centennial Celebration                        

Hello. I'm Todd Swindell, the editor of I Am Going to Fly through Glass: The Selected Poems of Harold Norse. I have organized several international events to celebrate the 100th birthday of Beat poet Harold Norse who was my friend and mentor.

Growing up gay in conservative Orange County in the 1980s, Harold's poetry saved my life. Since his death in 2009, I have worked passionately at preserving Harold's legacy. These poems and books relate his experience as a queer man through the 20th Century. His insight and inspiration will continue to guide a younger generation.


Born in Brooklyn July 6, 1916 to an unwedded, illiterate immigrant mother, Harold's gift for poetry gave him an incredible life of magic and hardship. In the 1940s he lived in Greenwich Village where he was friends with Allen Ginsberg, James Baldwin and Tennessee Williams. In the 1950s, he left America to live abroad for 15 years in Europe and North Africa. In Tangier he took hashish with his Moroccan boyfriend as they traveled the land sleeping on mats. In Paris he lived at the Beat Hotel cutting up words with William Burroughs. When Harold returned to America at the close of the 1960s, he settled in San Francisco where he wrote poems about gay liberation.
You only turn 100 once and I aim to make the most of this milestone. To raise funds, I am organizing an online book sale of Harold's rare, out of print works. Dedicated to his craft, Harold learned to live on simple means. Copies of his books were one thing he could offer to people. It was Harold's wish that his books be used to continue his legacy of poetry which shines light into the darkness of these times.

Harold Norse, San Francisco, 1973


  



Above is a photo of me with Harold at his last poetry reading in 2008.
What You're Funding  Travel and expenses to attend the European Beat Studies Network conference in Manchester, England June 27-29: $2,000. I'm presenting two talks about Harold Norse. The EBSN conference is a prime opportunity to network with scholars and students of Beat literature to make them aware of Harold's work. Additionally I'll attend and document numerous presentations with report back about the events at haroldnorse.com and other social media platforms.



Following Manchester, I'm organizing three Centennial events in San Francisco at the Mechanics' Institute (July 6), the Beat Museum (July 9) and at Beyond Baroque in Venice Beach (July 23). Each event features panel discussions with Harold's friends and fellow writers. There will also be a performance piece of Harold's poetry by the amazing L.A. artist Jason Jenn who has generously offered to travel north and contribute his talent and passion. Jason's work has included performances on gay writers like Paul Monette, C.P. Cavafy and poet and filmmaker James Broughton, a friend of Harold's. To offset the costs of having the events filmed and Jason's travel expenses, I'm hoping to raise $200.









Any remaining funds will continue the promotion of Harold's work including preparation of publishing the next book of Harold's writing: $300. In his archives there are many manuscripts never before published. Your generosity will help Harold's legacy not only continue but expand.

What You Get

This is a book sale, so you get to purchase extremely rare, out-of-print works by Harold Norse. The books are in mint condition and have not been previously read. Harold encouraged me to use copies of his books to raise funds to keep his legacy alive. By contributing to my campaign, you'll be helping Harold's dream live on, not only by reading his work but helping others do the same.
A number of perks are available for small donations including a set of bookmarks, designed specifically for the Harold Norse Centennial, for $5. A set of 5x7 photos of Harold, along with the bookmarks, is only $10.




When you contribute, you get more than just a book. Each Book Bundle comes with a set of Harold Norse Centennial bookmarks, photographs, a memorial collection of poetry by Harold's poet friends as well as rare Norse ephemera. (See the $30 perk for a full description.)



All contributions over $30 include a digital download of Harold Norse, Of Course..., a recording of Harold's 1984 poetry reading in Amsterdam. If you only want the recording, it's available for $10.

Over the course of the campaign, there will be exclusive Book Bundles of rare Norse publications priced from moderate to deluxe amounts including signed copies. Make sure to check back for updates about the books, video clips and  a new Harold Norse poem.





The Impact

Since meeting Harold in 1999, my interest in and understanding of his work has grown. After his death in 2009, I began gathering Harold's archives which are housed at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library. The volume and significance of the material convinced me that not only was it vital the archives be preserved, but they also must be known. The sale of these Book Bundles in the year of his Centenary is another step in keeping Harold Norse's legacy and work alive in the 21st Century.



                                                    



I have no connection to the man who made this video below. It's shared as an example of the impact Harold Norse's poetry can have when people discover his work. This is what he had to say about his evocative video,

""Over the past few years, Harold Norse has become one of my favorite Beat poets, but it wasn't until I received his collected, In the Hub of the Fiery Force, that I knew for sure. The use of subtitles is representative of homosexuals at the time having to be secretive of their love and seek it out of the public eye, or risk damnation. I love the contrast of Norse's sexual honesty with his solemn bit of advice, stating that homosexuals can essentially only exist if they keep the truth hidden, which demonstrates the extreme difficulty of living a lie when we, as humans, are so driven to freely pursue love and sexuality. And even though the world has grown more accepting over time, it still hasn't grown enough.""




Risks & Challenges
The events have all been planned and travel arrangements booked. This fundraiser is to recoup the costs, so there's no worry it won't happen. I will post regular updates about new Book Bundle perks with background about the works, along with different poems by Harold. So please check the Updates tab at the top of this page if you've just discovered this campaign.
I'd like to share with you some similar events I have done of which I'm very proud.

Following the 2014 publication of my selected edition of Harold's poetry, I organized numerous public readings throughout the Northern Bay Area at bookstores and arts centers.

                    

Last year I co-presented a talk about Harold at the Beat Museum's Conference in San Francisco and my detailed report back was posted at haroldnorse.com. Additionally I videotaped numerous presentations including a talk with Allen Ginsberg's psychiatrist from the 1950s who helped Ginsberg come out as as a gay man.

                                 

Please keep in mind that, in order to keep your costs low, all books will ship USPS Media Mail.

<p>We became slaves to our devices without realizing it. Instead of using them as helpful tools, we ended up mindlessly checking for updates and new likes every few minutes, and yet are always worried that we are missing out on something.  Research shows that because of being ""always on"", we sleep worse, are able to concentrate less; work more, but are less productive as we are constantly distracted, and don't feel as close to our friends. </p>

<p>It's all engineered behaviour. Big tech companies want you to stay online as much as they can keep your attention, because this is how they make money. At the cost of your life. The biggest problem is, most of us don't realize it, up until we try to change something. I myself worked in technology and realized how much time I wasted on managing devices and how unnecessarily dependent I became on my smartphone only when I tried getting rid of it. </p>
<p><strong>Homo Distractus is a practical and scientifically-backed book about how technology is taking away our choices, freedom and identities without us realizing it, and how we can fight it, by putting tech back to the place where it belongs. The place of a tool, not a master of our lives.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505217751/qxbuw9a1bespqaczkbfv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>In this book, you will find answers to the following questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How can I stop being afraid of missing out?</li>
<li>How much technology is too much?</li>
<li>How can I stay more focused and productive, and stop forgetting what I have just read?</li>
<li>How can I unplug, but at the same time not lose the connection with my social circle?</li>
<li>How can I balance the use of technology in my life?</li>
<li>How can I sleep better and feel more energetic?</li>
<li>Should I give devices to my kids, and how do I get them off the iPad?</li>
</ul>
<p>Homo Distractus shows you both a practical and science-backed way to live a more meaningful and fulfilled life without giving up tech altogether. Thanks to better managing your relationships with your devices, you will have more time and energy to do things that matter to you, and form better and deeper relationships with people around you.</p>

<h2>Why I wrote this book</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Anastasia, Homo Distractus author. I used to work in the heart of digital industry in London in a director position, managing multi-million budgets for big tech clients. As an international digital marketer, my job was to convince people to use more technology on behalf of famous tech brands. I learned a lot about how tech can hook your attention, and how to make you click on yet another cat video and keep you online for longer.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505220032/oezade7lccaokjyelszj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I got disappointed in how the tech industry manipulates people’s attention instead of helping them accomplish what they came for. I also saw how over-reliance on tech doesn’t make people happy. I worked in an environment, where people hardly spoke to each other in person even when they set next to each other, and were burning out by being “always on”. I myself felt constantly overwhelmed, too.</p>
<p>So three years ago I gave up my career together with my smartphone, in an experiment to find a more balanced lifestyle. This eventually led me to launching my business, Consciously Digital, doing a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNQujCwCu88"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TEDx</a> talk and <a href=""http://consciously-digital.com/courses--events"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">speaking </a>at global conferences on tech life balance, blogging for <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/author/anastasia-dedyukhina"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Huffington Post</a>, and writing this book.</p>

Well, I’m happy to say that this is a dream that can come true, and I’ve written a book to help you achieve it. The secrets that I reveal in my book are not rocket science, they don’t require a Ph.D. to put into action – what I’m going to tell you is more about common-sense, about applying yourself to the task with confidence and a clear vision of exactly what it is that you want.</p><p> </p><p>You are the architect of your own love life, and within the pages of my book, you will learn how to design and build the perfect relationship. There’s actually no magic formula that you can apply: instead, I’m going to ask you do a bit of honest self-assessment and soul-searching, so that you can learn how to trust in yourself – your gut instinct – about what it is that makes you happy. Believe me when I say that you already have within you, all the tools you’ll ever need to succeed.

Well, I’m happy to say that this is a dream that can come true, and I’ve written a book to help you achieve it. The secrets that I reveal in my book are not rocket science, they don’t require a Ph.D. to put into action – what I’m going to tell you is more about common-sense, about applying yourself to the task with confidence and a clear vision of exactly what it is that you want. You are the architect of your own love life, and within the pages of my book, you will learn how to design and build the perfect relationship. There’s actually no magic formula that you can apply: instead, I’m going to ask you do a bit of honest self-assessment and soul-searching, so that you can learn how to trust in yourself – your gut instinct – about what it is that makes you happy. Believe me when I say that you already have within you, all the tools you’ll ever need to succeed. In just a few short chapters, you will be equipped with your new-found knowledge, and you can go out and discover a whole new world of possibilities. I chose the analogy of becoming an ‘architect of love’ because it’s a solid, concrete (pun intended) way to visualise your future. The concept of love is rather abstract, and having a clear metaphor of a house gives you an easy way to understand what you need to do to allow love to enter your life. In the same way that a house can’t be built overnight, but requires careful planning and preparation concerning the structure, the layout, and the setting, so too do you need to examine your soul, your personality, your preferences and needs, in order to give you the best chance of success. I invite you to imagine building the home that you’ve always wanted and then use that as a metaphorical template for the relationship you’ve always wanted. In its most basic sense, this means, for example, reflecting on how the need for good foundations in a house are essential in a relationship too. By the end of the book, you will have envisaged your perfect home, from the foundations to location, and by doing this, you’ll be primed and ready for love. So, what makes me the right person to write this book? Although my experience as a life coach has taught me a great deal about relationships, and my training as a Master Practitioner in Neuro-Linguistic Programming has equipped me with the skills to teach communication and visualisation, my main inspiration has been my own life.

<div><br/></div>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>HearTheWritings.com is a Baha'i inspired endeavor to create incredibly high quality audio books of the Sacred, Historical and Secondary texts of the Baha'i Faith. Together with our cast of amazing narrators we work to make audio books that can transform your daily routines into time to immerse yourselves into the writings.</p>
<h3><b>What We Have Created?</b></h3>
<p>Building on the successes of our previous audio books by Shoghi Effendi and The Universal House of Justice we set out to achieve our primary goal of converting the Sacred texts. So over the last year+ we have spent an incredible amount of energy and resources to produce an amazing audio book version of Tablets of Baha'u'lláh.  This work is considered to be one of the most weighty of Baha'u'lláh's revelation. Abdu'l-Baha had this to say regarding this incredible work: <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>“Direct thine attention to the holy Tablets; read thou the Ishráqát, Tajallíyyát, the Words of Paradise, the Glad Tidings, the Tarazát, the Most Holy Book. Then wilt thou see that today these heavenly Teachings are the remedy for a sick and suffering world, and a healing balm for the sores on the body of mankind. They are the spirit of life, the ark of salvation, the magnet to draw down eternal glory, the dynamic power to motivate the inner self of man. ”<br/></p>
<p>Our experience creating, releasing, and marketing audio books for the Baha'i world has gotten us to this point.. and now we are ready to launch our first major title by Baha'u'lláh...  almost....</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Your Help:</h3> <p>The audio book production, editing and mastering is complete. The artwork and music is finished. The audio book is nearly 8 hours long and sounds glorious. Each audio book will be 7 CDs long! Now we just need your help to replicate the audio book CD sets. Help us take our final step:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $4500 to cover replication and shipping costs from our manufacturer.</li> <li>If we REACH our funding goal we will send off the masters to the manufacturer ASAP and have audio books in hand within a month! Yay!!!</li> <li>If we SURPASS our funding goal the money you contribute will be rolled into printing our next audio book title(s). (Up-Next: Kitab-i-Iqan!.. and we have 3 more in production right now!)</li>
<li>If we DON'T reach our funding goal we will have to reassess how we can get the remaining funds or find an alternate method to manufacture the CD sets at a price people can afford without compromising quality... but they will be manufactured!</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact:</h3> <p>We are creating something beautiful and profound for so many friends around the world. Tablets of Bah'u'lláh is the first of five major titles we have been working on and the others are coming hot on the heels of this one. With your help we can create these physical copies of the audio book which help us reach more Baha'is and seekers around the world with the Sacred Word than ever before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical CDs are a must for many developing communities around the world who don't have access to MP3 Players</li>
<li>Physical CDs are still the format of choice for most car stereos</li>
<li>Physical CDs are required so we can approach the various Baha'i distribution services around the world and have them help us get Tablets of Baha'u'lláh into the hands of more people than ever before.</li> </ul>

Arianna Huffington makes an impassioned and compelling case that we must
redefine what it means to be successful.<br/><br/>In this deeply personal book, Arianna shares how a painful wake-up call
taught her that while she might have been considered ""successful"" by
our society’s misguided ""money and power"" definition, she was not
living a successful life by any truly healthy, productive — and sane – definition
of success.<br/><br/>
She talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing
the demands of a career and raising two daughters — of juggling business
deadlines and family crises, a harried dance that led to her collapse and to
her ""aha moment.""<br/><br/>
Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the
fields of psychology, sports, sleep, and physiology that show the profound and
transformative effects of meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving,
Arianna shows us the way to <b>a revolution in our culture, your thinking, your

In Thrive,
Arianna Huffington makes an impassioned and compelling case that we must
redefine what it means to be successful.In this deeply personal book, Arianna shares how a painful wake-up call
taught her that while she might have been considered ""successful"" by
our society’s misguided ""money and power"" definition, she was not
living a successful life by any truly healthy, productive — and sane – definition
of success.
She talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing
the demands of a career and raising two daughters — of juggling business
deadlines and family crises, a harried dance that led to her collapse and to
her ""aha moment.""
Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the
fields of psychology, sports, sleep, and physiology that show the profound and
transformative effects of meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving,
Arianna shows us the way to a revolution in our culture, your thinking, your
workplace, and your life.In THRIVE You Will...

<h3><span>Join me as I spend six months based in Dakar, Senegal, launching the Fourth World Initiative--an interdisciplinary human rights think tank with a progressive pan-African approach!</span></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Who</h3>
<p><span>I’m a 27 year old attorney who applied to law school in 2005 with the goal of becoming a human rights advocate and a professor. Law school was a confusing experience for me, however, as I found myself without many mentors or any guidance about how to pursue a career in human rights advocacy or academia.  Uninspired after completing my studies in 2009, I joined a large corporate law firm, where I spent two years wishing that I were living out my dreams instead. I am now establishing the Fourth World Initiative (FWI) in order to provide other pan-African oriented and human rights-focused scholars, advocates and artists like myself with the intellectual and professional space and support that is so often unavailable to people from historically underrepresented backgrounds. This winter, I will travel to Dakar, Senegal in order to launch FWI and carry out its inaugural research project. </span></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The What</h3>
<p><span>I have been invited to work with major Senegalese radio and television outlets in a study, entitled <em>Bene Jigeen</em> (Wolof for ""one woman"") of emerging feminist discourse concerning polygamy and other traditional gender-based customs, which is taking place in mass and social media, against the backdrop of the passage of a Gender Parity law in Senegal and the appointment of 64 women to the nation’s National Assembly. </span></p>
<div>In particular, I will focus on 1) emerging feminist resistance to traditional gender expectations and gender-based practices, 2) the conflicts presented by the simultaneous adoption of these practices by Western women and 3) the impact upon mass and social media upon feminist African discourse and rights-positive legal developments. I will present my work in the form of scholarly research papers, with aspirations toward a short documentary film.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Additionally, I have been invited to present guest lectures on the impact of representations of women in film upon human rights at the National Film and Television Institute in Accra, Ghana. I also hope to conduct short-term research in Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire. This research project will take place from January through mid-June, 2013. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will be carrying out this project as an affiliated scholar of the West African Research Association (WARA).</div>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Why</strong></h3>
<p><span><em>Bene Jigeen</em> is the first installation of the Fourth Wave Project--FWI's flagship women's right research initiative. While I am only seeking funding for this particular research series, it is the Fourth World Initiative's first research project, and will effectively launch the work of FWI. Successful completion of this research project will provide a strong foundation for other FWI projects. </span></p>
<p><span>This project is important to me personally and professionally, but I am wholly committed to it because of its potential to: 1) open doors for others who have encountered the same professional obstacles I've faced; and 2) to encourage greater human rights awareness and engagement among African-Americans, who continue to wallow in socioeconomic inequality and suffer the cold, blunt impact of racism in a so-called postracial America with little awareness of economic, social and political progress taking place elsewhere in the world. In particular, I am keenly aware that the realization by women of their human rights is key to socioeconomic and political development in any community. The immediate goal of the Fourth Wave project is to literally advance a <strong><em>fourth wave</em></strong> feminist movement which encourages men and women in the pan-African world to advance women's rights on their own terms, realizing that the empowerment of women and girls is a proven catalyst for socioeconomic development in any society.  By supporting the establishment of FWI and its scholarship, you are making a valuable investment in our communities' intellectual, philosophical and cultural advancement.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The How</h3>
<p>I am incredibly excited about this project, but none of these opportunities are funded! Therefore, I'm dependent upon your generous support to make this research project possible. Specifically, I am hoping to raise enough to support: 1) six months' worth of basic living and research expenses (approximately $11,000 total) and 2) the estimated cost of fully launching FWI, incorporating it, and applying for 501c3 status ($1,500-2,000).</p>
<p>I have set the funding goal below the actual budget because I want to have a chance at attaining that goal (to avoid a penalty from Indiegogo), and also because I want to emphasize that every little bit helps--even towards a more abbreviated stay abroad. Plus, there are perks! Your donations are warmly accepted, and donors will be kept abreast of the project's progress, warmly acknowledged and given various tokens of appreciation, as described below. </p>

<p>At <a href=""http://www.artsnash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ArtsNash</a> we certainly strive to inform, but we also want to educate. It’s our hope that arts lovers will continue to read about the groups and artists they love from a new generation of writers. And our nonprofit organization needs your help to do that.</p>
<p>Giving at this Indiegogo page will provide more training and publication opportunities for emerging writers like Vanderbilt University student <a href=""http://artsnash.com/author/kelby_carlson/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kelby Carlson</a>. Kelby has written several music articles for us already, including <a href=""http://artsnash.com/classicalmusic/mahler-eighth-review/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a review of the Nashville Symphony’s 2012-13 season-opening concert in September</a>. Kelby, by the way, attended that gala concert with his seeing-eye dog Elvis. Since Kelby cannot see, he was unable to take notes during the performance of Mahler’s mighty “Symphony of a Thousand.” Nevertheless, he remembered every detail and wrote a beautiful review that ran the next morning. We couldn’t be more proud of him.</p>
<p>Others have joined our intern program, including college students <a href=""http://artsnash.com/author/quinton_parker/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quinton Parker</a>, <a href=""http://artsnash.com/author/katie_mills/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Katie Mills</a> and <a href=""http://artsnash.com/author/maranda_orrell/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maranda Orrell</a>. And we want to continue with them and others not just during the fall and spring semesters but into summers as well. That costs money in terms of time and resources from ArtsNash staffers, though, and we’d also like to offer stipends to these developing journalists/authors, so that’s why we’re asking for your donations now.</p>
<p>We’re honored to have a monetary donation of any size, and you’ll be a “Vice President of Promotion” – with the certificate to prove it – for ArtsNash when you give at least $5. Everyone who contributes that or more will also be listed on our website.</p>

For at least $50 we’ll send you a <a href=""http://artsnash.com/?attachment_id=11136"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">coffee mug emblazoned with our distinctive logo</a> or an <a href=""http://artsnash.com/?attachment_id=11565"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ArtsNash T-Shirt</a> (we have up to size XX Large) if you so choose; for $100 or more you can accompany one of our reviewers to a show or concert listed on this page – check back during the campaign because we may add more – for free if you decide that’s what you want to do (first come, first served – when someone has picked a particular event we’ll note on this page that it’s no longer available; limit one per donation). Yes, you can give those amounts or more without picking an incentive, but we want to offer them since we greatly appreciate your faith in us.</p>
<p>When you give, you’re not just helping develop young arts writers – you’re helping to expand the coverage of the exciting and eclectic Nashville arts scene we all love.

<p>My goal is to get to Kansas City for ths year's <a href=""http://www.rtconvention.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Romantic Times convention</a> May 1-5. Because of where I'm from a rural part of Missouri, there aren't a lot of opportunities to get to conventions. This would be a dream come true so I could help spread the word about my writing and network with other writers.</p>

<p>The registration fee for a published author is $474. In addition to the registration fee, I need money for a place to stay, gas, and a hot meal or two--fuel for the author's soul.</p>
<p>If you help support me here's what you'll get:</p>
<p>* A personalized 'Thank You' on my blog.</p>
<p>* A personalized 'Thank You' card in the mail.</p>
<p>* A free e-copies of The Treasure Hunter's Lady, The Sky Pirate's Wife, and The Turncoat's Temptress.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've been writing since I was young, but I had a five year gap of severe writer's block after my dad died in 2003. In 2008, I finally came up with an idea that got me back on track. I joined a writer's group, a couple of online groups, dedicated myself to learning and applying what I know.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Hi there. My name is Mike Bennett, and I'm the author of the free audio podcast novels, <em>Underwood and Flinch</em>, and <em>One Among the Sleepless</em>. I'm also the author of the podcast short story collections, <em>Hall of Mirrors: Tales of Horror and The Grotesque, Volumes One and Tw</em>o.</p>
<p>I've set up this Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to help me bring my latest work, <em>Underwood and Flinch</em> from podcast to print. I want to make the novel available in all formats - ebook, a paperback, and a hardback.</p>
<p>I wrote Underwood and Flinch over a three year period. Once a chapter was finished, I podcast it to an ever-growing global audience of listeners who were always hungry for their latest fix of the story.</p>
<p>Now that it's finally completed, I want to publish the novel as a print and paper book, and I'm humbly asking for your help to cover the necessary production costs. Anything you can afford will be greatly appreciated, and to show my gratitude, I'm offering perks at every level of funding - but the really great thing is, the finest perk I could offer you is already available for to everyone - for free - and that is <em>Underwood and Flinch</em>, the audio novel. It's complete and ready for immediate download in 45 episodes from <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/vampire-novel-underwood-flinch/id203424910"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""itunes"">iTunes</a>, <a href=""http://www.underwoodandflinch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""UF"">UnderwoodAndFlinch.com</a>, and <a href=""http://www.podiobooks.com/podiobooks/book.php?ID=699"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""PB"">Podiobooks.com</a>.</p>

<h3>So, what is Underwood and Flinch all about?</h3>
<p><em>All David Flinch ever wanted was a normal life. </em><br/><br/><em> But when you're a member of the Flinch family, normal has never been easy.</em><br/><br/><em> For hundreds of years, the eldest born male Flinch has been servant and guardian to the Lord Underwood. While the Flinches have changed through the generations, Underwood - a vampire - has been eternal. David had hoped to be spared the horror of serving his family's lord and master, but when he is summoned to the Flinch home in Spain by his dying older brother, he knows his luck has run out. Underwood must be resurrected from the grave in a ritual of human sacrifice, and David must be the man to do it. Because if he doesn't, an even greater evil than Underwood will rise: the evil that is David's sister. Underwood and Flinch is an epic horror-thriller that spans the centuries. </em></p>
<p><em>From the teeming slums of 18th Century London to an ex-pat community in modern-day Spain, Underwood and Flinch is an epic adventure that will grip you to the very last word.</em></p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Writing and podcasting <em>Underwood and Flinch</em> has often been a full time job for me, but it's been a labour of love, not one of earnings. Consequently, now that the time comes for me to bring the book to print, my resources are almost depleted. I need your help to fund the costs of publishing it and getting it on sale. My hope is that once it's on sale, it will begin to generate returns, and those returns will help to fund me while I write <em>Underwood and Flinch 2</em>. In short, you'd be helping me start up as an independent novelist who can publish his own work and hopefully make a living from it. Could that happen? Well, at the time of writing this, there have been nearly two million MP3 downloads of <em>Underwood and Flinch</em>, so if that figure is anything to go by then yes, I believe it could.</p>
<h3>Become A Patron of U&amp;F</h3>

The idea is to bring a breath of fresh air to classical literary Italian: a language, which when used by foreign students, isn’t worn out by a lifetime of use, and is therefore full of expressive potential. This fact is supported by <u>Jhumpa Lahiri</u>, an American author and daughter of Bengali Indian immigrants, who decided to start writing in Italian: “<i>I don’t have many words at all to express myself. I notice a state of deprivation. Yet, at the same time, I feel light and free. I rediscover the reason that I write, the joy alongside the need. I find again the pleasure I felt as a girl: putting words into a notebook that no one will read. In Italian I write without style, primitively. I am always in doubt. I have only my intentions, together with the blind, but sincere faith, of being understood and of understanding myself.</i>” </p><p> </p><h2>Why the Magazine</h2><p> </p><p>This magazine collects the best stories written by students, accompanied by<u> illustrations, grammar tips, and statistics about Italy</u>.

Corrections are made only to the grammar and orthography, not altering the original voice of the author, and allowing the native syntax to shine through.  Pensierini is in fact a literary undertaking. The idea is to bring a breath of fresh air to classical literary Italian: a language, which when used by foreign students, isn’t worn out by a lifetime of use, and is therefore full of expressive potential. This fact is supported by Jhumpa Lahiri, an American author and daughter of Bengali Indian immigrants, who decided to start writing in Italian: “I don’t have many words at all to express myself. I notice a state of deprivation. Yet, at the same time, I feel light and free. I rediscover the reason that I write, the joy alongside the need. I find again the pleasure I felt as a girl: putting words into a notebook that no one will read. In Italian I write without style, primitively. I am always in doubt. I have only my intentions, together with the blind, but sincere faith, of being understood and of understanding myself.”  Why the Magazine This magazine collects the best stories written by students, accompanied by illustrations, grammar tips, and statistics about Italy. Other than being recognition for the work done by these authors, it represents a tool for all those readers who want to practice reading literary texts written in easy to understand Italian. Approximately 2,000,000 people around the world study Italian. We think that it is interesting to further encourage the study and diffusion of Italian by means of writing, something that is often overlooked in language schools.    Format The magazine has been laid out and illustrated in a way to create an enjoyable reading experience and support the study of Italian. There are even gaps in the magazine, where students can relax and practice their written Italian, responding to various prompts.-48 full color pages, 17x24 cm (7x9.5 in.)-32 stories-2 grammar tips-1 table with a list of typical Italian expressions-5 writing exercises-illustrations About Us Project Creator: Ugo Coppari. “I am a novelist, who has been teaching Italian to foreigners for the past 10 years. I decided to create this project to combine these two worlds and also because I was curious to know what was happening in the minds of different people across the globe and their typical daily experiences. More generally I would like to know about the ordinary lives parallel international events (political elections, governmental successes and crises, wars and immigration, warnings about climate change, problems of unemployment, developments in artificial intelligence, etc.) and how these events can influence the development of everyday lives.

<p>Sy Hubby has chronic asthma and was forced to stay indoors often. As a result, to stay active, we created a YouTube channel, where Sy played a spy character; the channel has successfully garnered over 1.7 million views.</p>

<h2><strong>Pentalpha by Michelle A Cervantes</strong></h2>
<p>My book, <i>Pentalpha</i> is about a girl in college with magical abilities. While trying to fit in with her magical abilities, she meets other people who are similar to her and are able to help her discover the true power behind her abilities. This novel embraces the concept of self discovery and recognition of the power within all of us. I wrote it so that readers can partake in this journey of self discovery that will resonate with them for years to come. My book will publish in February, 2020.<br/> </p>
<h3><u><strong>Story of My Book</strong></u></h3>My name is Michelle Cervantes and I am the author of Pentalpha. I wrote this book because I want readers to experience a world of magic merged with the college experience, particularly at UCLA. I want readers to be involved in my journey through college while also experiencing magic in this alternative universe.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the true sense of belonging from within. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for magic and self-discovery in you. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover the journey in life will lead you to harness your true powers from within.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn the meaning behind Self-discovery, Community and Empowerment:<p> </p>
<p><strong>Self-discovery</strong> - Curanda takes an impromptu journey to Mexico in hopes to find herself and connect with her ancestral roots</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong> - Curanda and her friends joining the group on campus called <i>The Community</i></p>

Pentalpha is a fiction book that speaks to both college students and adult paranormal fantasy fanatics alike who are looking for a story involving modern magic and experiencing the college culture<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>The Book - Pentalpha</strong></u></h3> The book is written in Three Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and chapters 1-3 establishing Curanda’s background and her connection with her magical abilities as well as joining The Community<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 4-6 that highlight the college experience by having the characters manage their classes +social life while also hiding their magical abilities. Curanda learns to balance everything out from school work to even a developing relationship while trying to discover more to her powers. She also begins to prepare for her journey to Mexico in hopes of discovering not only her powers but her self as a whole.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 7-10 that involve Curanda discovering more about her powers while being faced with a dark force known as the Dark Shadows that threatens to destroy humanity. She and The Community re-unite at UCLA in hopes of fighting them off. She also discovers who she can actually trust relationship wise. This part also includes a climax and unexpected ending that readers are sure to enjoy!<br/> <h3><u><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></u></h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569634294/yus1al6xluyxuz7o9vs8.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><strong>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</strong></p>

She has experience with publishing stories and keeps close ties with the New Age, Metaphysical and Pagan communities, incorporating experiences from these communities into her novel to allow readers to experience magic.Her passions revolve around healing others through reiki energy healing, learning more about everyday magic and researching intimate relationships, integrating all of these aspects into her novel.<br/><br/>If you wish to summon her, draw a circle on the floor with sugar, bring lots of dark chocolate, a fluffy dog, dragon’s blood incense, and her favorite book: <i>Witches, Sluts, Feminists.</i><br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Michelle at mcervantes.michi@gmail.com and Instagram @michellecervantes17, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Facebook.<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<h3> </h3>

</div><p>Thank you so much of all of your love and support!<br/><br/>Thanks again,</p><p>Michelle A Cervantes</p><p>PS: Here's an overall summary for y'alls to enjoy! </p><p><u><strong>Overall Summary</strong></u><br/><br/>Nineteen-year-old Curanda always felt like an outsider. Ever since she discovered her power of bringing plants back to life, Curanda knew she was not like most people. Until she left for college.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We have all been torn at some point by what we were told to be, what was expected of us and what we know to be right within ourselves. We try to fit the mould dictated by others, living up to their expectations, often cutting bits of ourselves off in the process.</p>
<p>Philosophers have asked these questions for centuries and it seems now, more than ever, we have a need to make sense of ourselves and our humanity, as the world we live in becomes more and more ""humanly senseless""...  Who are we, what are we allowed to be, where are we being led and what will it mean for us as human beings... What is the bigger picture of our creation?</p>
<p>The more I have opened up, the more I realise the number of people who suffer in silence, unable to articulate their turmoil and pain. Our stories are important and ought to be told. I hope through sharing my story, it will show people that it is ok to speak up and show ourselves for who we are - our pains, our joys, our fears, our thoughts, our feelings and everything in between. The wall or 'normalisation' and taboo ought to be brought down in order to shine a light on what is truly happening within ourselves.</p>
<p>I believe it is through our own personal truth that we can make a difference in our lives, the lives of others and in the world. It is okay to say things as they are, putting aside the politically correct and the idea of 'perfection' that has been established in our society.</p>
<p>My name is Laura, originally from France I now reside in London. For a number of years I suffered from bulimia which had a heavy impact on my life and affected it rather dramatically. Having recovered and made sense of my experience as well as its reasons, I now want to share my story with people, hoping it might help them map their own journey and find their way out and to themselves.</p>
<p>The condition slowly led to a descent into the abyss of my own being, as I searched for clues of who I was (as a person and a human being) and who I was allowed to be. The existential crisis I suffered from an early age, took me on a journey of self discovery where through self-harm, pain and despair I found not only myself but some deeper understanding about our condition as human beings. </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My name is Stas Arsonov, and I am the author of The <i>Happiness Manual: A Guide to Your Daily Self-Mastery.</i> I read a lot of excellent books in the field of self-help and personal development. They were all very inspiring books, but after I finished reading them, I was unsure how to apply it all to my life. I would get motivated for a few days, then pick up the next book, and the vicious circle of searching for ways to implement the information would continue. What I was really looking for was a self-help manual - a handbook that I could come back to again and again for guidance. That's why I wrote <i>The Happiness Manual: A Guide to Your Daily Self-Mastery.</i><br/><br/>I wrote <i>The Happiness Manual</i> because I realized it's not always enough to say, <i>""I choose to be happy."" </i>There are rituals and lifestyle adjustments that you can implement to achieve that state. I made it my mission to discover those and apply them to my life. I interviewed and learned from experts in the field how they took their leap of faith and pushed beyond their comfort zone and what awaited them on the other side. On my journey through life and writing this book, I have learned that achieving happiness consists of a few essential components, and that's what you'll find in this book.<br/><br/>Through reading this book, you'll learn about the journey of self-discovery and self-mastery. You'll hear stories from:<br/> </p>
<ul>
<li>Scott Schwenk - a phenomenal meditation and breathwork teacher who helps people let go of their limiting beliefs, leading them to experience more joy in their lives. His teachings help many people live in harmony and become mindful of their thoughts, words, and actions.</li>
<li>Kai Karrel - a writer, a mystic, and a spiritual teacher who has facilitated hundreds of workshops worldwide guiding people through the journey of awakening and helping people build healthier relationships.</li>
<li>Exciting individuals who inspired me on my journey. People like Dr. Joe Dispenza, Bo Eason, Tony Robbins, and David Goggins. </li>
<li>Many of the guests who appeared on the Think Clever podcast, appear in this book as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>In reading <i>The Happiness Manual: A Guide to Your Daily Self-Mastery</i>, I hope you will discover that you can generate happiness every day. My goal is to show you it's not some mystical state that you need to deserve rather it's available to you right now. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement I found for the process of self-discovery and self-mastery. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you cultivate inner peace despite all of the ups and downs of life.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are ready to release the limiting beliefs that hold you back from expressing your full potential and experiencing more joy in your life. If you want to have a better relationship with yourself and the people around you, <i>The Happiness Manual</i> will become an excellent resource for you.</p>

The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this coming Spring.

 
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish it.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.
You will have the opportunity to do a one-on-one coaching session with me.
You will receive early access to the Introduction and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review them and give me early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
And much more!

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #happinessmanual and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.
Thank you so much for all of your love and support!Thanks again,Stas Arsonov",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are a boutique guild of young independent authors based in the Greater Toronto Area. Our vision is simple: take our passion for storytelling and transform it into a career, helping each other along the path to success every step of the way.</p>
<p>Co-founded by indie authors Jody Aberdeen and Lucianna LiSacchi, the <a href=""http://www.torontowordslingers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Toronto Wordslingers</a> aspire to creating sharply original, relevant, and compelling fiction across many genres.</p>
<p>We aspire to achieve great things doing what we love the most. And we need your help to get started, with our debut event, <strong>AN EVENING OF SEX AND ROMANCE</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why ""Sex and Romance""?</h3>
<p>The ""sex"" component comes from Lucianna's debut novel ""Mommy's Little Playgroup"", an erotic drama where an innocent exchange between one woman and her best friend's husband grows into a deep exploration of dark desires.</p>
<p>The ""romance"" component comes from Jody's debut novel ""Convergence"", a time travel romance with a twist in which the way opens between two fated lovers in parallel universes, but not for the reasons they expect.</p>
<h3>How do I get invited?</h3>
<p>If you're in the Greater Toronto Area and would like to be invited, simply donate here and contact Jody at <a href=""mailto:jaberdeen@rogers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jaberdeen@rogers.com</a> letting us know you're joining us. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
<p>Taking place at the beautiful Arta Gallery in Toronto's Distillery District, the night will feature readings, book signings, cocktails and mingling, and a few special activities, all of which come at a cost that we need to pay in advance.</p>
<p>Your donations all include admission to the event in Toronto on February 1st, and will help offset our expenses for the following:</p>
<p>- Venue rental<br/>- Print costs for books and promotional material. <br/>- Photographers<br/>- Media</p>
<p>We are also offering a variety of perks in exchange for your donations (see the menu to the right).</p>
<h3>The Impact Of Your Donations</h3>
<p>First, we have a philanthropic component to our fundraiser. We are partnering up with the <a href=""http://facadeacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Façade Academy of the Arts</a>. Located just north of the city in Vaughan, Façade is the official school of the 2013 Vaughan Film Festival and recently launched their brand new Professional Acting Curriculum.</p>
<p>In conjunction with Academy founder Mina Spremulli, if we are successful in our fundraising goal for <strong>AN EVENING OF SEX AND ROMANCE</strong>, we will donate $500 of monies raised to the academy to be used in the school's first ever Professional Acting Scholarship. By contributing to our event, you'll be helping shape the professional future of one promising young arts student.</p>
<p>You'll also be helping to promote local Toronto businesses in the Distillery District and beyond. We are all very lucky to work and live in Greater Toronto, and anything we can do to add to the quality of life and art here at home is worthwhile.</p>
<p>And, of course, you'll be helping one boutique writer's guild punch far above its weight.</p>
<p><strong>AN EVENING OF SEX AND ROMANCE</strong> brings together individuals and groups from many different areas of our great community, and will be a night to celebrate for many reasons.</p>
<p>And let's not forget yourself! Whether you're flying solo or if you have someone special, it's a fantastic night out on the town at the start of Valentine's season. You'll get to hear our stories, learn a few new things (both in and out of the bedroom) and maybe leave with more than what you expected than when you walked in.</p>

London, 1815 - The Roxy Playhouse is in trouble! 
The Roxy Playhouse Irregulars, those libertine artists and dreamers are up to their necks in debt.

""Pay up in one month, or its curtains for you all!""

Dark times lead to drastic schemes and so the Irregulars decide to reinvent themselves as 'performance thieves', infiltrate High Society and 'Robin Hood' their way through it. 

However, getting embroiled in a dark and deadly plot to destroy the Monarchy was never part of their script.

The Roxy Irregulars will have to stage the performances of their lives if they want to save the day and make it home in time for last orders.

******

Brandenburg is a fast, fun and romantic adventure with a modern, anachronistic slant - think 'Oceans 11 out drinking with the Scarlett Pimpernel' and you'll get the tone of this action packed story.


The book is written, and now funds are being sought to release the most amazing artwork from Leighton Johns, get the proof copy signed off and get that first run printed.

This campaign is designed to push the production of this book over the last hurdle, create some awareness and to start getting the ball rolling on what is sure to be a rip-roaring success. 

TheNeverPress needs:
$160 to release the artwork
$80 to set the title up with the printers
$160 to print proof copies for the proof readers
$250 to print the first run for press reviews and promotion

The book as the potential to be great, we just need great patrons...and you will be rewarded. 

Up to $5 gets you a personal thanks as a patron in 'Hats off to Brandenburg'.
$10 gets you a thanks in the book, and a signed postcard of the cover art.
$25 gets you a thanks, a postcard and a signed copy of 'TheNeverPages', the debut novel from Graham Thomas.


$75 gets you a thanks, a postcard, a signed copy of 'TheNeverPages' and a signed 1st Edition of 'Hats off to Brandenburg'.
$150+  gets you all the above and a signed, framed poster of the cover art of 'Hats off to Brandenburg'.

If money is too tight to mention, don't worry - you can still be a part of it all. Tell your family and friends, spread the word and become a fan of 'Hats off to Brandenburg' on facebook.

<h2><em><strong>I Thank You On Behalf of ALL WOMEN EVERYWHERE for Your Generous Heart, Caring Spirit, Love, Support &amp; Concern You Have Shown for US.</strong></em></h2></div>","MeKah's Mission
Peace & Love to You Dear Reader. My name is MeKah & I am a Writer, Aspiring Inspirational Speaker, Spoken Word Artist & Mother of 6 Beautiful Daughters.
I am also a survivor of child molestation, rape, domestic violence & the welfare system.
Sadly, my life-story is not unique.
I am not the only survivor of such evils.
Inside Every Woman There Is A Story Waiting To Be Told &
I Want To Help You Tell Yours. 

MeKah's Mission is to develop a center for self-empowerment & healing where women can share their S.I.S.T.E.R.S. Stories.
Every woman carries a story of Strength, Inspiration, Sacrifice, Transformation, Redemption, Revelation & Self-Love inside of her.
We must share these stories with each other in order to increase the level of communication & understanding between the younger & older generations. As well as lighten the mental, physical, emotional & spiritual baggage we carry, so that we can begin the great work of healing the wounds inflicted upon womanhood.
We women must shine a light into all the dark corners in the locked closets of our hearts by exposing the painful experiences we have had to endure & show how we have been able to carry on in spite of them.
We must also tell the stories of joy, love, hope, faith, courage & triumph, so that we will be able to heal ourselves, our families & our communities. So please, help us by funding our campaign, supporting our organization, contributing your story, spreading the word & encouraging others do the same.

MeKah's Mission will be using the proceeds from this campaign, & profits from our book sales to:

Cover relevant business costs outlined in further detail below


Give out 918 Copies Each of our Anthology, (Our S.I.S.T.E.R.S. Stories) & Our Self-Help Manual, (M.A.K.E. Y.O.U.R. M.A.R.K. How to Tap Into Your Hidden S.T.A.R. Power), to Michigan Area Women & Children Homeless Shelters, Domestic Violence Shelters, Teen Runaway Centers & other Women Centered Organizations. (Please Feel Free To Make Referrals to Organizations)



Provide 918 Workshop Vouchers (Payment Assistance for Low Income Workshop Participants)


Purchase/Lease a facility for our organization, MeKah's Empowerment Center for Conscious Communication Activation & Healing, AKA M.E.C.C.A.H. 918 for short.


Having our own facility will enable us to reach more women & families by providing a meeting place where women can fellowship & empower themselves through open, honest, conscious communication amongst each other free of judgement, prejudice, social stigmatization & religious persecution.
While M.E.C.C.A.H 918 chooses to focus primarily on issues concerning women & their families, we welcome EVERYONE who desire positive change, enlightenment & creation of mutually beneficial relationships within their community.

<p>Based upon Lewis Carroll's classic 1871 Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There, The Vampire Alice book gives the story a dark, gothic, grown-up twist. For in this version Alice is a vampire, and the world she encounters on the other side of the mirror is a decidedly gothic, grotesque, and dangerous one. While still possessing the whimsy and fairy tale quality of the original, this re-imagining brings oodles of blood and monstrous darkness into play. Make no mistake, while this book is at times both amusing and enchanting, it is also downright gory! Alice is a vampire. She feeds on blood and thrives on the erotic tension her feeding creates.</p>
<p>On the eve of the ceremonial burning at the stake of a great werewolf, Alice journeys through the looking glass to a dark, menacing world. In this strange world she appears to be followed (or is that stalked?) by an ancient werewolf, until the reason why the fates of werewolves and the fates of vampires are so often bound up together is revealed to her.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, The Vampire Alice is portrayed in several photographs by Lexie Lambert.</p>

<p>Excerpt from the book:</p>
<p><b>Chapter 1. Looking Glass House.</b></p>
<p>One thing was certain, that the girl with the blonde hair had nothing to do with it – it was the girl with the black hair's fault entirely. For the blonde girl had been having her blood sucked out of her by the old Mistress vampire for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that she <i>couldn't</i> have had any hand in the mischief.</p>
<p> The way the Mistress sucked mortal's blood was this: first she held the poor thing down by its hair with one mighty hand, and then with the other hand she twisted the head to one side, revealing the juicy flesh of the neck, into which her bright white fangs bit and onto which her lips attached like terrible suckers; and just now, as I had said, she was hard at work on the blonde girl, who was lying quite still and trying not to moan – no doubt feeling confused as to why the act of dying should feel so erotic.</p>
<p>But the girl with the black hair had been tied up all afternoon, and was meant to be Alice's meal. But Alice was feeling both restless and tired and not in the slightest bit hungry, and so she was sitting curled up in a corner of the great armchair, half talking to herself and half asleep. However the black haired girl kept trying to escape, and occasionally managed to free herself of the ropes that bound her, so that Alice had to climb out of the chair and sleepily slap her around a bit before tying her back up. </p>
<p> “Oh you wicked little thing!” cried Alice, catching up with the girl, and giving her a kiss to make her understand that she was in disgrace. “Really, you ought to have better manners. You must be eighteen winters old by now, and I would have thought that your parents would have taught you to behave more appropriately in civilised company!” she added, looking reproachfully at the girl, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage – and then she scrambled back into the chair, this time taking the girl with her, and deciding that perhaps she was hungry after all, she started to lick the girl's neck. But she didn't get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the girl, and sometimes to herself. The girl sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to not to look at Alice, and now and then putting out one hand towards her blonde haired friend, as if she could help her in the slightest.</p>

The video gives you some background to my story. Hi, My name is Steve and for 9 years I was bullied. I was bullied by both male and female individuals and after hitting a low point I turned my life around.  I appeared on LIVE National television in the hope of telling others what had happened to me and to help others to not go through what I did. When I was being bullied the first thing that wanted was help and advice.  My campaign is to write a book called 'Lollipops and A** whopping's' which will be written by me. The book will cover my story - including all it's ups and downs before going on to giving advice, knowledge and key insights that I hope young people will fine helpful. I'm not doing this to make myself money but rather to help individuals - those being bullied, those bullying others but also the bystanders. I have a personal motto - To be the Light in someone's darkness. All it takes is one person - Just one to make a difference, to be the light. I need a minimum of £500 to write the book - for me to go away and write over a week everything. Some may say why not just write? The truth is when I will write this book I will have to rake over old memories and it will be upsetting. I've put my family through them already. This money will give me a chance to write the book and complete the first stage. 10-20% of all proceed's from eventual book sales will go bullies out. (www.bulliesout.com) They have one key aim - For all young people to recognise their self-worth and potential and to flourish in a positive, caring environment free from oppression and abuse. They as an organisation, have achieved some truly remarkable things and I hope that once the book is written and published that they will get the proceeds to fun their work. The other 80% will go on costs and will be reinvested for future projects. The FundingAs said above I need a minimum of £500 to make this campaign happen. All money raised whether we meet our target or not will go towards the book. I've set up a small group called 'The Crazy Owl Group' which brings together volunteers and remarkable individual's to help edit and market the book and they will ensure that all money is put to good use. If we raise over our target that means we can do more amazing things - like purchase a web domain, market materials etc. So there you have it - everything that you should need to know but in case you need more information then please do let me know.

<p>The Forgotten is the first book in a series called The Lux Guardians. The Lux Guardians is a young adult dystopian/urban fantasy series that tells the tale of Branwell and Bennet, twins from Victorian London, and Honour and Horatia, twins who live in Forgotten London - a future wreck of the city we all know and love.</p>
<p><strong>Full summary:</strong></p>
<p>Honour and Horatia Frie are twins living in a world of wreck and ruin.</p>
<p>Forgotten London is a dismal place of containment, rationing, and a four-family-per-house regulation. Twenty five years ago the world was set ablaze when solar flares obliterated three quarters of the Earth’s population and wiped out whole continents in one blow. The flares brought with them The Sixteen Strains: agonizing and fatal diseases that plague each of the forty one zones of Forgotten London and the rest of the world. The only places that escaped fatal damage were two countries now known as The Cities – States and Bharat. The rest of the world – The Forgotten Lands – is contained within borders for the people’s protection against even deadlier Strains outside the barrier. But fifteen year old Honour thinks differently. He thinks that they’re kept inside the fence for other, more menacing reasons. He thinks that States are planning to kill them.</p>
<p>Branwell and Bennet Ravel are twins living in a world of danger and secrecy.</p>
<p>In Victorian London, years before the solar flares hit, the Ravels’ world has just been turned upside down. Their father, poisoned by something even genius Branwell can’t determine, has passed away. His dying words were unnerving orders to keep each other safe no matter the cost, and to hide everything he has ever invented. When one of his creations goes missing – a device named The Lux that can generate unlimited energy – the twins are shocked to discover that their very own government has stolen it and, according to their father’s journals, are planning to use it to create unfathomable explosions to destroy their world.</p>
<p>The Ravel twins will have to find and reclaim The Lux if they are to stop their world’s planned destruction, but when they’re transported to an unfamiliar, derelict world, the search for the device will become harder than ever. Honour and Horatia, against all odds, will have to find a way to stop States before the remainder of Earth is eradicated and their world is lost for good, or somehow get every single citizen of Forgotten London outside of the fence.</p>

<p><strong>About the author</strong></p>
<p>I've been writing fiction for as long as I can remember, always creating characters and fictional settings inside my head. Only within the past three years did I begin writing novels. It’s always been a dream of mine to have my work published, and to have people read it. I’ve so often been changed and deeply affected by a writer’s words. Now I want to do that for other people.</p>
<p>My big dream is to release The Lux Guardians <strong><em>for free</em></strong> so that others can read and access my writing without having to pay a fortune, or anything at all! I know how annoying it is when you want to read a book but you don't have enough money to actually buy the book. I don’t want that for my readers. And because of this, I’m skipping the literary agent and the editor and the publisher and all of that costly stuff, and doing it all myself (with the help of my family and my talented writer friends) and going straight to getting the book out to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the project</strong></p>
<p>If this project is fully funded, which I really hope it will be!, then I will be able to produce a mere seventy five books in paperback (as well as being able to afford your perks and rewards), but it’s a start and it means I can get my words out to seventy five people who wouldn’t otherwise have them. And of course to you as well!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, I’d ask for enough money to produce two hundred books, but the $1800 target looks especially daunting to me, and I’ve opted to keep things a little more reachable so at the very least I can give away <em>some</em> books.  With the target money, I can get seventy five 5.5 x 8.5 inch softcover books printed, a small number of limited hardcover books to give away in the perks bundles, as well as the other goodies that are available.</p>
<p>As you can see it’s a small amount of books to aim for, but any money I receive will be put into ensuring at least one person gets my book. So even if at the end of this I make $25, it will be a success in my eyes!</p>

<p><strong>Rewards!</strong></p>
<p>And now the most exciting part, and the bit you’re most interested in.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates, absolutely anyone, will have their name listed in the acknowledgements section in the back of the book as a special thank you for helping make this project happen. Also available are four exclusive stickers that feature the main characters of the novel, an exclusive bookmark, an ebook of the finished novel, a signed and numbered paperback, a signed and numbered hardback, an ebook of side stories that have never and will never be found anywhere but here, and (most excitingly) a minor character named after you, or named anything you choose!</p>

<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please, please, please, even if you can’t donate $1, tell everyone you know about my campaign.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">La distrofia muscolare di Duchenne Colpisce quasi esclusivamente il sesso maschile durante i primi anni di vita, l'incidenza stimata è 1 su 3500 maschi.</span></p>
<p>La distrofia di Duchenne viene di solito riconosciuta al terzo anno di vita, ma almeno la metà dei pazienti presenta i segni della malattia prima che inizi la deambulazione.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Costituisce il 50% di tutte le forme distrofiche. Le femmine non sono colpite dalla malattia, ma ne sono portatrici, in quanto la malattia si eredita come carattere recessivo legato al cromosoma X. </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Il difetto è localizzato sul cromosoma X. Pertanto, solo i maschi (che hanno un solo cromosoma X) possono esserne colpiti da tali forme, mentre le femmine generalmente non hanno sintomi.</span></p>
<p>I primi segni che attirano l'attenzione sono l'incapacità di camminare o correre quando queste funzioni avrebbero già dovuto essere acquisite; oppure, una volta che queste attività vengano acquisite, i bambini appaiono meno attivi della norma e cadono facilmente.</p>
<p>Con il passare del tempo aumentano le difficoltà a camminare, correre, salire le scale. I primi muscoli ad essere colpiti sono il quadricipite, l' ileopsoas e i glutei. I muscoli del cingolo scapolare e degli arti superiori vengono colpiti successivamente.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>We're Aldi, Matteo and Antonio, the RakiRush, three guys with a common passion: traveling. </p>
<p></p>We recently had an idea, share with others our interest and use it to do something good, help scientific research into Duchenne Muscular, conducted by the ""Centro Dino Ferrari"", University of Milan.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>So here is our plan: </p>
<p>we will travel through the Balkans by car,  sleeping in a tent. Day by day we will film our adventure with a camera. </p>
<p><b>Once back at home will post all the videos on our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/RakiRush"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youtube channel.</a> </b></p>
<p><b>The money we will gather from the displays will be entirely donated to the <a href=""http://www.centrodinoferrari.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dino Ferrari Center</a> in Milan. </b></p>
<p>The ""Centro Dino Ferrari"", University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan, is responsible for clinical and scientific research in the field of muscolar and neurodegenrative diseases.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<p>Our journey will begin Sunday, September 21, starting from our home in Rapolano Terme, in the province of Siena, Italy. We're going to cross Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo to finally reach Albania. </p>
<p>Among the fantastic places that we will have the opportunity to visit are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>the Postojna Caves (Slovenia) </li>
<li>the Plitvice National Park (Croatia) </li>
<li>Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina) </li>

Tre Ragazzi a zonzo

Ciao a tutti,
Noi siamo Aldi, Matteo e Antonio, i RakiRush, tre ragazzi con una passione in comune: viaggiare.


Di recente abbiamo avuto un'idea, condividere con gli altri il nostro interesse ed usarlo per fare qualcosa di buono, aiutare la ricerca  scientifica sulla Distrofia Muscolare, condotta dal “Centro Dino Ferrari”, dell’Università degli Studi di Milano. 

Così ecco il nostro progetto:
viaggeremo attraverso i Balcani in macchina e dormiremo in tenda. Giorno per giorno riprenderemo la nostra avventura con una videocamera.
Una volta tornati a casa pubblicheremo tutti i video sul nostro canale Youtube.
I soldi che riusciremo a raccogliere dalle visualizzazioni saranno interamente donati al Centro Dino Ferrari di Milano.

Il  “Centro Dino Ferrari”
dell’Università degli Studi di Milano, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda, Ospedale
Maggiore Policlinico di Milano,  si
occupa di ricerca clinica e scientifica nel
campo delle malattie muscolari e neurodegenerative.

Il nostro viaggio comincerà domenica 21 Settembre, partendo dalla nostra casa a Rapolano Terme, in provincia di Siena, attraverseremo Slovenia, Croazia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo per giungere infine l' Albania.

Tra i luoghi fantastici che avremo occasione di visitare ci sono:


le Grotte di Postumia (Slovenia)


il Parco nazionale dei laghi di Plitvice (Croazia)

Mostar (Bosnia ed Erzegovina)
il Durmitor National Parck (Montenegro)
Prizren (Kosovo)
il parco di Theth (Albania)

e tanti altri!

Qui potete trovare la nostra pagina 
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRakiRush


E qui quella di twitter: https://twitter.com/therakirush



“Centro
Dino Ferrari”: www.amicicentrodinoferrari.com



A voi la palla!
Nel mentre che stiamo compiendo questo viaggio abbiamo pensato che potesse essere utile dare anche a voi la possibilità di contribuire in modo da raccogliere più fondi possibili.
Questo è il motivo per il quale abbiamo creato questa campagna. 
Donare è molto semplice:
basta cliccare sul riquadro ""contribute now"" a destra della pagina e seguire le indicazioni in tre passi.

Donando potrete anche, se lo desiderate, scegliere tra i premi che abbiamo messo a vostra dispozione (li trovate anche in questa pagina, nella colonna a destra).

Tutto viene fatto tramite PayPal, un metodo sicuro di pagamento online che ormai oggi tutti conoscono ed usano.

Ecco come potete fare:

Cliccate sul riquadro rosa con scritto ""Contribute Now""
ora puoi scegliere il tuo premio (se lo desideri, altrimenti vai avanti cliccando su ""continue"")
digita la somma che vuoi donare nel riquadro e clicca su ""continue to payment"" (sotto alla finestra con scritto l'importo, puoi anche scegliere se la tua donazione dovrà essere anonima)
Controlla la finestra di riepilogo, a questo punto clicca su "" Go to Paypal""




Perchè è così importante per noi?Il nostro amico, Mihay, come tante altre persone, ha la distrofia.
Troppe volte ce ne stiamo con le mani in mano  quando per fare qualcosa basterebbe molto poco, ecco perchè siamo qui.
Non terremo un singolo centesimo di tutto quello che donerete ne di quelli che verranno dalle visualizzazioni su Youtube.


Poco è meglio di niente!


Nulla è troppo piccolo o insignificante se mettiamo le nostre forze insieme.
Anche una piccola donazione può cambiare tutto.
Pensate che se ognuna delle persone che visiterà questa pagina donasse anche solo un euro avremmo già raggiunto un traguardo al di là di ogni nostra aspettativa.






Non solo donazioni....
Se non potete contribuire ci sono molti altri modi in cui potete aiutare:

Iscrivetevi al nostro canale Youtube

Mettete ""mi piace"" alla nostra pagina Facebook

Guardate i video
Continuate a seguirci
Fateci sapere la vostra opinione e i vostri consigli

Perchè tutto questo?
Youtube da un certo ammontare per ogni visualizzazione, sulla base di specifici algoritmi, quindi guardare anche solo una volta uno dei nostri video significa che stai già contribuendo a combattere la Distrofia.
Ecco spiegato perchè abbiamo bisogno che ci aiutiate a diffondere il nostro progetto.


Per quelli che non lo sanno

La distrofia muscolare di Duchenne Colpisce quasi esclusivamente il sesso maschile durante i primi anni di vita, l'incidenza stimata è 1 su 3500 maschi.
La distrofia di Duchenne viene di solito riconosciuta al terzo anno di vita, ma almeno la metà dei pazienti presenta i segni della malattia prima che inizi la deambulazione.
Costituisce il 50% di tutte le forme distrofiche. Le femmine non sono colpite dalla malattia, ma ne sono portatrici, in quanto la malattia si eredita come carattere recessivo legato al cromosoma X. 
Il difetto è localizzato sul cromosoma X. Pertanto, solo i maschi (che hanno un solo cromosoma X) possono esserne colpiti da tali forme, mentre le femmine generalmente non hanno sintomi.
I primi segni che attirano l'attenzione sono l'incapacità di camminare o correre quando queste funzioni avrebbero già dovuto essere acquisite; oppure, una volta che queste attività vengano acquisite, i bambini appaiono meno attivi della norma e cadono facilmente.
Con il passare del tempo aumentano le difficoltà a camminare, correre, salire le scale. I primi muscoli ad essere colpiti sono il quadricipite, l' ileopsoas e i glutei. I muscoli del cingolo scapolare e degli arti superiori vengono colpiti successivamente.

Per maggiori informazioni vi invitiamo a visitare il sito web del Centro Dino Ferrari: http://www.centrodinoferrari.com/ 



Un Grazie enorme!!


Grazie a tutti i voi per il vostro supporto e la vostra gentilezza
Vi informeremo continuamente su come il nostro viaggio procederà, seguiteci e aiutateci a realizzare questo sogno!

Three guys on the bummel


Hello everyone, 
We're Aldi, Matteo and Antonio, the RakiRush, three guys with a common passion: traveling. 
We recently had an idea, share with others our interest and use it to do something good, help scientific research into Duchenne Muscular, conducted by the ""Centro Dino Ferrari"", University of Milan.
So here is our plan: 
we will travel through the Balkans by car,  sleeping in a tent. Day by day we will film our adventure with a camera. 
Once back at home will post all the videos on our Youtube channel. 
The money we will gather from the displays will be entirely donated to the Dino Ferrari Center in Milan. 
The ""Centro Dino Ferrari"", University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan, is responsible for clinical and scientific research in the field of muscolar and neurodegenrative diseases.


Our journey will begin Sunday, September 21, starting from our home in Rapolano Terme, in the province of Siena, Italy. We're going to cross Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo to finally reach Albania. 
Among the fantastic places that we will have the opportunity to visit are:


the Postojna Caves (Slovenia) 
the Plitvice National Park (Croatia)

Even if we fall short of our entire goal, every dollar raised means we can offer readers more great books, and offer our team members a great environment in which to pursue their artistic dreams. 

  Your Help Matters Why do we need your help? 
We seek to provide great books that combine a low cost with high value. EP offers a one-stop shop for readers of most genres, where they can trust in the quality of the books they purchase. At the same time, we seek to compensate authors and their supporting team in a manner suitable to their talents and efforts - great royalty rates. In a marketplace that is both crowded and a bit haphazard, and in an economy that has offered considerable challenges for many years, combining those two bullet points above is not always a simple matter.
We wish to keep our authors, and our whole team, moving forward even during these tough times, and your support will be a vital step in that process. 





  What's In It For You?  We understand that you may want to help us out because you're a fan of the arts, and because you love the idea of a place where the two critical sides of the equation come together: 
Artists produce great work for your enjoyment because they can afford to keep doing so. You enjoy great books now and well into the future, from a constant source of such works, in no small part due to your help. 
However, we also want to make sure you get a real and immediate benefit in return for your help. Thus, each of the funding options provided, ranging from as little as $2 all the way up to $400, will give you a value that makes it an immediate benefit to you. Additionally, depending on the option you choose, you may receive public recognition for your support, or even a whole new platform for supporting the art of literature that you love so much (part of the ""Forever Fan Club"" funding option).



About our FOREVER FAN CLUB

We saved the best
for last. As a “Forever Fan,” you will be eligible to receive all eBooks
published by (and still under contract with) Evolved Publishing.  As of the date of this campaign, we have 70
active titles in English, with 15 more coming before the end of 2014. On tap for 2015 so far are 25-35 titles, and we expect to release 25-50 titles every year for the foreseeable future. You’ll be
able to get all of our eBook releases, many of them weeks in advance of the
actual release date, FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE! Wow. If you’re an avid reader
who appreciates quality books, this is an amazing opportunity.
Given that our
average eBook price is $3.99, you can see that it won’t be long before you’ll
be ahead of the game, if you love reading as much as we love providing you
great books.
Additionally, we will create a special page at
the EP website to honor your support of EP. Though it won’t be active until this
campaign is complete, it will appear at www.EvolvedPub.com/ForeverFans. We
will, at the very least, list you by Name, City, State, and Country.
Additionally, it will be your option to provide a full bio and headshot so that
we can create a nice, full profile for you. Finally, as a Forever Fan, we will
give you the opportunity to guest blog at our website about your favorite EP
books, authors, team members, etc. You will, in essence, become a valued part
of our team.

Come visit our website at www.EvolvedPub.com, subscribe to our newsletter and blog, stop by our Facebook page (EvolvedPublishing) and ""Like"" it, and share worthwhile posts there, and follow us on Twitter (EvolvedPub). We can always use your help.

<p>Help us run this ad on sites NRA members visit.</p>
<p>The NRA makes it harder for members to quit its organization than for felons to buy weapons at gun shows. We’ve learned that NRA members who’ve tried to quit have been told their resignations would not be accepted because they didn’t resign through the NRA’s “official process.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NRA fights to keep loopholes open that enable anyone – including dangerous felons – to walk into gun shows and buy weapons with no background checks whatsoever. The NRA fights for this over the objections of the majority of its members who SUPPORT universal background checks.</p>
<p>Not only does the NRA make it hard for people to quit, but it also keeps quiet about just how many members have tried to leave. While the NRA tries to keep resignations quiet, the media occasionally learns about high profile resignations, such as August Busch IV, heir to the Budweiser brewing fortune, who’s resignation letter told NRA leader Wayne LaPierre he “should be ashamed of himself and his organization” for opposing universal background checks and for representing the interests of gun manufacturers over its rank-and-file members.</p>
<p>We run Watchdog Causes, LLC, a cause-related communications company that specializes in online marketing and social media communications. We’ve been doing it for nearly 17 years, and our work reached over 40 million people for various causes in the last 18 months, alone.</p>
<p>We want to launch “How to Quit the NRA,” a campaign that will educate disaffected NRA members about how to quit, and also provide them with a place to make their actions and opinions known. We believe there are many rational, gun owning, 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment-supporting NRA members, like August Busch, who have already quit, but not been recognized for it, or who WOULD quit, if only they knew how. We believe it’s important that such people have the opportunity to make their voices heard – and not be impeded and shrouded in secrecy by the NRA.</p>
<p>“How to Quit the NRA” will consist of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A series of web ads, the first featuring August Busch IV, publicizing the brave actions of NRA members who’ve resigned in opposition to the organization’s shameful policies. Note: If enough money is raised, these web ads could become television ads in targeted markets.</li>
<li>The establishment of a blog and Facebook page for “How to Quit the NRA”</li>
<li>The creation of tools that aid disaffected NRA members in the resignation process</li>
<li>A public, online forum in which those who quit the NRA, who wish to be recognized for it, can be recognized</li>
<li>Paid online advertising, raised via this campaign, that will ensure the peoples’ voices are heard</li>
<li>A national press release, which will let the mainstream media know about this important grassroots effort</li>
</ul><p>Because Watchdog Causes controls social media accounts that link to over 120,000 concerned activists, who are themselves connected to over 20 million friends, this campaign will reach at least 1.3 million people in just 3 days. Through viral sharing, millions more will be reached within a week.</p>
<p>This campaign will let the people be heard. It will send a message to the NRA that its members must be listened to. More importantly, it will send a message to our cowardly Congress that the NRA isn’t so frightening, anymore.</p>

As both scholar and priest, I bring a unique perspective to the study of Her lore, incorporating both scholarship and ritual insight. My writings on the Morrigan, spiritual practice, and other topics have been widely read in my blog, <b>the Shieldmaiden Blog</b>. I bring years of experience serving the community through building organizations and developing traditions, such as my work in the founding of the <b>Coru Cathubodua Priesthood</b>, and the <b>Stone City Pagan Sanctuary</b>.

Yet, I have never thought it would be necessary to put everything I know to practice with my own child.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">At 2001, I gave birth to my second daughter, Margo. She was born extremely premature on the 26<sup>th</sup> week, weighed only 770 grams (1.7 Ibs). During her first months, Margo experienced nearly all the typical horrors of severely premature children: a severe hemorrhage in her brain, two whole-body inflammatory states, retinal pathology and almost a complete hearing loss. On repeated occasions she was on the verge of death. At the neonatal intensive care unit, they gently asked: Maybe you should let her go rather than make her live such a miserable life. However, Margo still struggled and we have made a decision to struggle with her.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">When we signed out of the hospital three months later, she weighed 2200 grams (4850 Ibs) and her prognosis was very pessimistic.  We took home a child with serious hearing problems, cerebral paralysis, no fingers on the left hand (following a prevention of blood flow) and a variety of concerns in dozen other spheres. We almost lost any hope she would be able to: understand, talk, walk, run, read, write, jump, dance, learn and make friends… would be able to live, like everyone else.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">Then I started writing- at that time I didn't know it was going to be a book.  These notes include many useful methods, funny episodes, thoughts and ideas. My native language is Russian, so I wrote in Russian, It started as an online diary of mother of a problematic child. Since then, it has been more than 10 years.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">My wonderful daughter has excellent grades and will go next year to 5<sup>th</sup> grade in a regular Israeli school. She runs and jumps, dances and sings, avidly reads encyclopedias and fairy tales, speaks two languages and started learning English, tries to play the guitar- with no fingers on one of her hands(!) and is mathematically gifted.  Of course we were very lucky, but we have also put a lot of effort into it. All the family raised her, each family member contributed individually. Margo is adored by everyone in the family; she has friends in school and a hundreds of friends around the world- those who have read my notes about her for 10 years.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">My experiences of being a special educator and of raising Margo gave birth to the site as2X2.com. On this site I publicly posted, what eventually turned into a book and a story of success. The entire book is published in Russian at <a href=""http://as2x2.com/content/dnevniki-goshkovoda"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://as2x2.com/content/dnevniki-goshkovoda</a>.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">Many times I received requests from parents and specialist from different countries to translate this book to English. This way the book would become available for a bigger audience, including non-Russian speaking parents. Our friends in Russian community helped us to translate some excerpts of the book to English. One can read them at <a href=""http://eng.as2x2.com/content/learning-playing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://eng.as2x2.com/content/learning-playing</a></p>

<p dir=""LTR"">It is not easy to translate such a text; it requires professional translation including many episodes of child's speech. Fortunately a translator was found. Still, this service requires 7000 dollars, and an additional amount of 3000-4000 dollars for the final editing of English text by a native speaker. If we succeed to raise this money, the English text of the book will be published for  free online access.</p></div>","My name is Lara Shpilberg.  I have a master's degree in special education and years of working experience here in Israel.

Many times I received requests from parents and specialist from different countries to translate this book to English. This way the book would become available for a bigger audience, including non-Russian speaking parents. Our friends in Russian community helped us to translate some excerpts of the book to English. One can read them at http://eng.as2x2.com/content/learning-playing
 
It is not easy to translate such a text; it requires professional translation including many episodes of child's speech. Fortunately a translator was found. Still, this service requires 7000 dollars, and an additional amount of 3000-4000 dollars for the final editing of English text by a native speaker. If we succeed to raise this money, the English text of the book will be published for  free online access.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Author...Like a Deer in Headlights</strong></p>
<div>River Eirtree was born in Wyoming to Los Angeles-native parents. She was raised as a toddler in Southern California; spending every weekend at Disneyland, her mother continually took her onto the ""It's A Small World"" ride. Eventually, River got the message.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finding herself in her developmental years living next to a circus in Baraboo, Wisconsin, River spent her time riding elephants and camels, and shoveling tiger manure. For three years, she also attended clown college and mime school, just for good measure. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Attending college in Wyoming, River worked as a rodeo photographer. She majored in Music Performance (String Bass) while cultivating a love of archery and fencing.

<h3>Printing History<br/>
</h3>
<p>For over 30 years, The Yeshe De Tibetan Text Preservation Project, named after one of the greatest translators of 8th-century Tibet, has preserved, published and freely distributed Tibetan Buddhist texts. Each year, at the Nyingma World Peace ceremony in Bodh Gaya, India, thousands of monks and laymen come to Bodh Gaya to receive these reprinted texts in an effort to preserve their heritage and the Buddhist teachings.<br/></p>
<p>This year, Yeshe De is printing the Derge edition of the Tanjur texts. The Tanjur contains the commentaries of Indian and Tibetan masters through the ages and contains invaluable advice for Buddhist practitioners. Buddhist knowledge is not static and as such is constantly being explained and eludicated by living masters who have practiced the path.</p>
<p>By helping us print this high quality edition of these texts (consisting of 3,387 texts by 758 Indian masters and scholars,  translated into Tibetan by 373 panditas (learned masters) and translators!) you help keeping both the Tibetan heritage ánd the living transmission of the Buddhist teachings alive. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Funding and Tie-in project</h3>
<p>The total funds we need for this project exceeds many tens of thousands of dollars.<br/>However, groups all over the world have already committed to fund large parts of the project with their own volunteer projects and labour.</p>
<p>The printing process is already on motion. To sustain the printing we need to generate at least 1100 EURO in funds. This money will go towards operating costs, shipping and materials.</p>
<p>Ány contribution is helpful! One of the main tenets of Buddhist thought is that any positive action is significant. We invite you to view even the donation of one euro towards this goal as such and to appreciate your own spirit of sharing. <br/></p>
<p><b></b>We have tied this project to our Tsa-Tsa project. A tsa-tsa is a small Buddhist clay stamped sacred symbol, in this case a small stupa. Sacred symbols in Buddhist tradition are visible manifestations of the Buddha. If you make a donation of 50 EURO you will receive one of our handmade tsa-tsa's. When you make a donation of 108 EURO or more, you will receive 3 tsa-tsa's. You can keep the tsa-tsa for yourself, or give it away to loved ones (or enemies!).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>But what do these books do?</h3>
<p>Tibetan Buddhism is popular, but is in serious danger of becoming a watered down version of what the Buddha actually taught. Buddhism is something that relies on both study ánd practice.

For over 30 years, The Yeshe De Tibetan Text Preservation Project, named after one of the greatest translators of 8th-century Tibet, has preserved, published and freely distributed Tibetan Buddhist texts. Each year, at the Nyingma World Peace ceremony in Bodh Gaya, India, thousands of monks and laymen come to Bodh Gaya to receive these reprinted texts in an effort to preserve their heritage and the Buddhist teachings.
This year, Yeshe De is printing the Derge edition of the Tanjur texts. The Tanjur contains the commentaries of Indian and Tibetan masters through the ages and contains invaluable advice for Buddhist practitioners. Buddhist knowledge is not static and as such is constantly being explained and eludicated by living masters who have practiced the path.
By helping us print this high quality edition of these texts (consisting of 3,387 texts by 758 Indian masters and scholars,  translated into Tibetan by 373 panditas (learned masters) and translators!) you help keeping both the Tibetan heritage ánd the living transmission of the Buddhist teachings alive. 


Funding and Tie-in project
The total funds we need for this project exceeds many tens of thousands of dollars.However, groups all over the world have already committed to fund large parts of the project with their own volunteer projects and labour.
The printing process is already on motion. To sustain the printing we need to generate at least 1100 EURO in funds. This money will go towards operating costs, shipping and materials.
Ány contribution is helpful! One of the main tenets of Buddhist thought is that any positive action is significant. We invite you to view even the donation of one euro towards this goal as such and to appreciate your own spirit of sharing. 
We have tied this project to our Tsa-Tsa project. A tsa-tsa is a small Buddhist clay stamped sacred symbol, in this case a small stupa. Sacred symbols in Buddhist tradition are visible manifestations of the Buddha. If you make a donation of 50 EURO you will receive one of our handmade tsa-tsa's. When you make a donation of 108 EURO or more, you will receive 3 tsa-tsa's. You can keep the tsa-tsa for yourself, or give it away to loved ones (or enemies!).


But what do these books do?
Tibetan Buddhism is popular, but is in serious danger of becoming a watered down version of what the Buddha actually taught. Buddhism is something that relies on both study ánd practice. The books we reprint will enable practitioners in the centuries to come to continue to read the words of masters who lived the knowledge and are as such capable of giving relevant instruction on the Buddhist path.
Over the years the Nyingma organisation of Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche, through the Yeshe De Text Preservation Project has reprinted and distributed over 8 million books. These books now form the basis of libraries for both monasteries and western dharma centers where students can once again study them and put them into practice.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a 25-year old independent researcher and writer based out of Montreal, Quebec. I am a self-employed writer (i.e., poor), with a focus on studying ideas, institutions, and individuals of power and resistance across a wide array of social, political, economic, and historical spheres. I have been doing research and writing for roughly six years, and have been published on CounterPunch, AlterNet, Occupy.com, Truthout, TruthDig, RoarMag, and have been a guest on CBC Radio, BBC Radio, Russia Today and RTAmerica to discuss a number of different political and economic issues.</p>
<p>My research aims to be at academic standards, but my writing aims to be accessible and comprehensible to all. My approach is highly critical and my conclusions are often radical, but I follow the facts and do the research to reach my own conclusions. I post my writing on my website (<a href=""http://www.andrewgavinmarshall.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.andrewgavinmarshall.com</a>), which includes excerpts from my book, and I am also starting a research and writing project with Occupy.com (a media outgrowth from the Occupy Wall Street movement), and am also heading up the Geopolitics division of a new think tank (to be launched soon), called The Hampton Institute. I have written a great deal on the global economic crisis, the history of the American Empire, Europe's debt crisis, and social movements from Europe to the Arab Spring, the Chilean student movement and Quebec's 'Maple Spring.'</p>
<p>I have been crowd-funding The People's Book for over a year now just through my own website and social media. While the Project has maintained, I have limited resources and limited reach. My objective is to raise $5,000 in order to finance the completion of the first volume of the People's Book Project.</p>
<p><strong>The People's Book Project</strong></p>
<p>The People's Book Project aims to produce a series of books examining, in detail, the ideas, institutions, and individuals of power and resistance, through history until modern day.The objective is to provide a thorough, well-researched, radial critique of power and study of resistance, in order to arm activists with information and knowledge to change the world for the better. Revolutionary times need revolutionary ideas. In the past three years, youth have been in revolt from Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, and Yemen, to Greece, Spain, Italy, the UK, Portugal, Iceland, Chile, Canada, and increasingly in the United States. My aim is to help my own generation - and future generations - deal with the major issues and problems of our time (economic, political, social, environmental, and cultural), by providing a synthesis study of these issues, their root causes, the institutional and ideological structures of power, and the evolution of resistance around the world. </p>
<p>The First Volume, which this funding objective is for, introduces readers to the institutions of domination in the world today, and the evolution of resistance and potential for global revolution. Among the many topics covered are:</p>
<p>- The Concept of a 'Sociopathic Society': imagine a world in which those who run governments, corporations, banks, international organizations, and other powerful institutions were all functional sociopaths. What do you think this world would look like? My suggestion is that this is exactly the world we live in. </p>
<p>- An introduction to Empire: how has imperialism functioned since World War II? What are the main institutions, ideologies, and individuals who promote, operate, and profit from empire? This includes studying the military-industrial complex, foreign policy, National Security strategies, think tanks, foundations, and key strategists over the past 50 years, such as Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>- The Global Economic Crisis: what are the ideological and institutional causes and consequences of the global economic crisis? Focusing on the roles played by the major banks, government agencies, ideological doctrines (such as neoliberalism), and the effects of the crisis upon the poor, middle class, and those who caused the crisis (in the top 0.001%). </p>
<p>- The European debt crisis: What are the causes of the European debt crisis? Was it really that Greeks are lazy, or that Italians like to drink? Or was the causes embedded within the European monetary and political system itself? The response of the crisis has been to make it worse, punishing the populations of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, and Spain into abject poverty and exploitation through the implementation of ""austerity"" and ""structural adjustment"" measures. What is taking place in Southern Europe is spreading across the Western world, and reflects what the West has done to Africa, Asia, and Latin America since the 1980s debt crisis. </p>
<p>- The Arab Spring: It began in Tunisia, spread to Egypt, Yemen, and beyond, but also to lesser known uprisings in Bahrain, Morrocco, Algeria and Jordan. What are the conditions that caused the uprisings, and what have been the reactions been from the local dictatorships and the foreign (Western) imperial powers that fund and arm them? How has the Arab Spring evolved and adapted over the past two years? Where might it head in the future?</p>
<p>- Popular resistance in Europe: From the anarchists and anti-fascists in Greece, to the Indignados in Portugal and Spain, resistance is spreading like wildfire across Europe, new movements, radical actions, and often with anarchists on the front lines. If 20th century resistance largely saw socialists and communists as the main forces of resistance to the West, the 21st Century is seemingly showing anarchists on the front lines both within and outside the West itself.</p>
<p>- Occupy the Police State: Resistance emerged in America in the form of the Occupy Movement, which rapidly became a global phenomenon. How did the Occupy movement emerge and evolve over time, what actions and initiatives has it undertaken and what have been its failures and accomplishments? The reaction from the government has been revealing, as declassified documents showed that Federal and State-level police agencies, directed by Homeland Security, sought to undertake surveillance and ultimately destroy the Occupy Movement. Looking at the function and actions of Homeland Security, the emergence of a surveillance society and the attacks upon civil liberties, America is rapidly becoming a police state designed to protect the powerful from the people. </p>
<p>- Empire in the Age of Obama: Did the Obama administration bring ""hope"" and ""change"" as promised, or simply more of the same? Looking at imperialism under Obama, drone warfare, assassination programs, support for coups, the arms trade, funding and arming of dictatorships, wars and militarization, the American Empire under Obama has reached dangerous new levels which, if escalated into Iran or further into Pakistan, threaten to engulf entire regions and possibly the world into dangerous new conflicts. </p>
<p>- Poverty, food crisis, land grabs: With half the world's population living in abject poverty and hunger, with one billion people living in slums, the global food crisis which erupted in 2007 (and continues to today) is pushing tens of millions more into desperation while banks like Goldman Sachs and Barclays literally make a killing. The price of food has sparked a global land grab, with rich investors from America, Europe, China, India, and the Gulf dictatorships grabbing vast tracts of land in Asia, Latin America, and especially Africa, displacing rural communities, destroying biodiversity, and threatening much deeper levels of poverty and hunger. </p>
<p>- Environmental crisis and Indigenous resistance: what are the root causes of the global environmental and ecological crises we face? Truly, we are at a point in which humanity can potentially face extinction if we do not radically change the way in which we interact with the environment. Indigenous peoples around the world are on the front lines of envrionmental devastation, with their land and resources stolen and plundered by multinational corporations and powerful states; and they, too, are on the front lines of resistance, from Ecuador, Brazil, Sub-Sahran Africa, to Canada with the 'Idle No More' movement, Indigenous peoples are teaching the people of the world that we are all 'indigenous' to Earth, and must protect it lest we destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>- The College Crisis and Student Resistance: Education is in crisis, with youth ""over-educated"" and under-employed. Students have been on the front lines of protests in Egypt, Tunisia, Spain, Greece, and beyond. What has happened to the institutions of education, and what direction are they headed? Why are youth shackled with enormous debts before they even have a chance to begin their lives and seek autonomy? Student resistance has become a powerful new force, with massive student movements shaking Great Britain, Chile, Quebec, and Mexico. How can student movements evolve, and how should education evolve? </p>
<p>- Global Governance and Global Revolution: the response of power to the multiple global crises it has created (political, economic, social, environmental) is to globalize power further, to create new global institutions managing monetary, economic, financial, and political functions. Corporations are leading the way with ""free trade"" agreements, becoming more powerful than most governments of the world, while states integrate into regional entities (such as the EU), and we begin the process toward establishing institutions of global 'governance.' On the other hand, resistance too, is globalizing. What is the evolution of resistance in different regions of the world, and how can it find new opportunities for co-operation across borders, regions, languages, and cultures? What is the potential for a global revolution, and what could the outcomes of such a process be?</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, but rather some of the main points of discussion and analysis which will be examined in the First Volume of The People's Book Project. Donations to this Project will allow this work to be done, to acquire the time and resources necessary in order to finish the first volume and begin the editing and publishing process. </p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
The $5,000 fundraising goal is to fund my research and time into writing this volume of The People's Book Project, acting as patron to my efforts, and allowing me to access the required materials and resources (such as newspaper subscriptions, journals, and other necessities) which will strengthen the research and inform the conclusions. Whether or not the entire funding goal is reached, every bit will help support my efforts in pursuing this Project. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The aim of The People's Book Project is to provide an easily accessible and comprehensive resource for individuals, activists, and others to empower themselves with knowledge and inform their actions. True change for the better can only come from ""the People"", from popular resistance and collective action and individual initiative. The People's Book Project is written for the people, to help the people in whatever way it can, and is entirely dependent upon support FROM the people in order to become a reality.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to be able to provide a meaninful and useful resource largely for my own and future generations, to be both an easy introduction to those who are newly interested in power and resistance, as well as adding useful information and new ideas to those who are already well versed in such issues. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think that a necessary pre-requisite to solving any and all of the world's problems is firstly to engage in open, honest, and direct communication. This requires an honest understanding of ourselves and the world we live in, and communicating openly and directly with one another, in our individual relationships and between cultures and communities globally. This book aims to encourage an open, honest, and direct discussion and understanding of the world we live in, and what we can all do to make it a better place. </div>
