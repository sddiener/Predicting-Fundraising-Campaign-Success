<p><b>NEED PROTECTION WHILE YOU WAIT? WE GET IT.</b></p>
<p>Redefining protection doesn't happen overnight. Developing and engineering cases as complex and protective as TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK take time...and we're not cheaters. We got the iPhone data the same day you did, and we've been hard at work ever since. From development and tooling to testing and obtaining IP68 and MID-STD-810G ratings, we are committed to designing the best products possible. That will take a few months. However, we can appreciate that you want to get your device protected as soon as possible.</p>

<br/><p>That's why we're offering to ship you our brand new SEISMIK case for iPhone 6, FREE of charge while you wait.

<p>A:
Our cases are designed to be compliant with the Apple headset and lightening
cable.. At this stage in our development process, it is too early to test any 3<sup>rd</sup>
party accessories with our product. However, we will be including an audio
extender with both TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK, at no additional cost. </p>
<p><b>Q:
Will the audio extender shown in campaign photos be included for both TAKTIK
360 and AQUATIK? </b></p>
<p>A: Yes! Our plan is to include audio
extenders for both products, at no additional cost. </p>
<p><b>Q:</b>
<b>Will TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK be
compatible with Touch ID?</b></p>
<p>A:
Yes, both cases will be Touch
ID compatible using a hyrdophobic optically clear barrier, allowing you to have
full access to the home button while your iPhone is installed in the case.</p>
<p><b>Q:
How do I install the TAKTIK 360 and
AQUATIK on my iPhone 6?</b></p>
<p>A:
TAKTIK 360 will be a 3 step assembly process, and the AQUATIK 360 is a simple
one step process.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the sound quality from my iPhone 6
reduced by the AQUATIK or the TAKTIK 360?</b></p>
<p>A:
Both cases are designed to be fully waterproof, but they will also be designed
to minimize acoustic degradation in the process of meeting the IP-68 standards.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do the cases stay waterproof,
especially the AQUATIK since there is no locking mechanism?</b></p>
<p>A: We have
patent-pending compression closure systems and seals for both TAKTIK 360 and
AQUATIK that make the cases airtight, keeping water and dust out (IP68).</p>
<p><b>Q:</b><span><b> </b> <b>Can I
take pictures/use my iPhone underwater?</b></span></p>
<p>A: Yes, you will. As we move closer to testing the
product, we will be able to give more specifics around underwater
functionality. </p>
<p><b>Q:<span>  Is there a belt clip?</span></b></p>

<p>A:<span>  While a belt clip for both products are
possibilities in the future, at this time we are not currently developing these
products. Signing up for our newsletter at LUNATIK.com is your best way to stay
in the loop.</span></p>
<p><b>Q:</b><span>  <b>Why
Indiegogo over Kickstarter?</b></span></p>
<p>A: We

Since then, TAKTIK has successfully protected thousands of iPhones for those who rely on their gear—people who serve in our military, police, firefighters, skydivers. Users who won't settle and whose hobbies, passions, jobs or lives depend on having the best gear available. We care deeply about making products of the highest quality possible and are grateful to have an incredible community of uncompromising users to help inform our products. 
Now with the launch of the new iPhone 6, we've raised the bar again.
Introducing TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK, our most advance device protection ever.
DESIGN WITHOUT LIMITS








Creating a fully submersible waterproof case that doesn't compromise the design and use of the iPhone is no small feat. We've designed airtight compression closure systems for both TAKTIK 360 + AQUATIK 
that
protect from water and dust to an IEC rating of IP68. 
That
means with all ports and membranes closed, your iPhone will stay safe and dry
for up to one-hour in water as deep as two meters. Stay connected while you take a worry-free swim in the pool or venture down the river in your kayak with confidence.







Our best-selling TAKTIK Extreme has saved thousands of phones from the most extreme impacts and drops. Our fans have proudly shared their wild survival stories—epic journeys, 3000 ft. skydive drops, 50mph tumbles off of motorcycles, cases even getting run over by cars and phones making it out unscathed. Each time reminding us why obsessing over the details really matters. 
TAKTIK 360 + AQUATIK are designed to provide fearless drop, shock and impact protection that exceeds military standards (MIL-STD-810G). Most of all, you can go anywhere life takes you and not have to worry about whether your phone will survive your next epic adventure. 








Let's face it. Every now and again, sh*t happens. The new iPhone is sleeker and slimmer than ever, but with its smooth rounded corners and larger screen, it is highly susceptible to accidental slips and drops. Whether your phone falls out of your pocket into uncharted toilet bowl territory or down the side of a mountain, TAKTIK 360 + AQUATIK are designed to protect from life's unexpected moments. 






The dangers of not using protection are clear. On average, 2 out of 3 smartphone users damage their phones. Repairing or replacing a damaged phone cost you time, money and potentially valuable data. Why risk it? Use the proper protection and enjoy your mobile life with confidence.

The Corning® Gorilla® Glass lens adds an extra layer of screen protection without compromising a fluid touchscreen experience. Fully prepared for life’s unexpected adventures, TAKTIK 360 is the ultimate in rugged protection.



















AQUATIK: SLIM ULTRA-PROTECTION


Engineered
to go wherever life takes you, AQUATIK is sleek, refined, and fully water and
dust-proof. The low profile, easy-to-pocket, snap-in design compliments the slim form factor of the iPhone 6. AQUATIK achieves an advanced level of protection through case and membrane seals capable of keeping out water and dust (IP68). It’s our thinnest, ultra protective case yet.  














NEED PROTECTION WHILE YOU WAIT? WE GET IT.
Redefining protection doesn't happen overnight. Developing and engineering cases as complex and protective as TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK take time...and we're not cheaters. We got the iPhone data the same day you did, and we've been hard at work ever since. From development and tooling to testing and obtaining IP68 and MID-STD-810G ratings, we are committed to designing the best products possible. That will take a few months. However, we can appreciate that you want to get your device protected as soon as possible.




That's why we're offering to ship you our brand new SEISMIK case for iPhone 6, FREE of charge while you wait. Inspired by the airless tires on military vehicles, SEISMIK's shock-absorbing perimeter guards incredibly well from unexpected impacts and drops. So well, it actually bounces on impact. 





WE ARE LUNATIK

LUNATIK exploded onto the global tech scene in 2010 with TikTok + LunaTik watch kits and essentially sparked the global crowd-funding movement. Since LUNATIK's inception, we have positioned ourselves as a premium lifestyle brand that consistently challenges convention and exceeds consumer expectations. Led by award-winning design entrepreneur Scott Wilson, founder of Chicago-based design and experience firm MINIMAL, the team has a proven track record in bringing disruptive solutions to market. 




WHY INDIEGOGO? HELP PUT OUR PLAN INTO ACTION


We care deeply about making the best products possible and are grateful to have an incredible community of uncompromising users to help inform our products. Users who won't settle and whose hobbies, passions, jobs or lives depend on having the best gear available. 
No design is perfect. The quest for ultimate protection is an evolutionary, iterative and expensive process, and we've been continually learning, refining and pushing the limits since TAKTIK was first introduced for the iPhone 4s. 
We are small design company, not a billion dollar case brand that has unlimited resources and distribution. With your support, we are focused on shipping TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK in Q1 of 2015. We are truly excited to share this journey with you. As we move further into the campaign, we will be providing frequent updates and insight into our development process. We value the journey as muc2h as the final product and hope you do to.






TAKTIK
360 and AQUATIK FAQ:


Q: Can I pre-order cases for iPhone 6
Plus in this campaign?

A. No, our
Indiegogo campaign is only focused on ultra-protective waterproof cases for iPhone 6. We are in development to
make some 6 Plus products from the LUNATIK collection, but don't have a launch timeline to share right now. As always, the best way to stay in the loop on our latest news and product launches is to sign up for the LUNATIK newsletter.
Q:  Will TAKTIK
360 and AQUATIK work with other 3rd party accessories or fit into existing
docks?
A:
Our cases are designed to be compliant with the Apple headset and lightening
cable.. At this stage in our development process, it is too early to test any 3rd
party accessories with our product. However, we will be including an audio
extender with both TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK, at no additional cost. 
Q:
Will the audio extender shown in campaign photos be included for both TAKTIK
360 and AQUATIK? 
A: Yes! Our plan is to include audio
extenders for both products, at no additional cost. 
Q:
Will TAKTIK 360 and AQUATIK be
compatible with Touch ID?
A:
Yes, both cases will be Touch
ID compatible using a hyrdophobic optically clear barrier, allowing you to have
full access to the home button while your iPhone is installed in the case.
Q:
How do I install the TAKTIK 360 and
AQUATIK on my iPhone 6?
A:
TAKTIK 360 will be a 3 step assembly process, and the AQUATIK 360 is a simple
one step process.
Q: Is the sound quality from my iPhone 6
reduced by the AQUATIK or the TAKTIK 360?
A:
Both cases are designed to be fully waterproof, but they will also be designed
to minimize acoustic degradation in the process of meeting the IP-68 standards.
Q: How do the cases stay waterproof,
especially the AQUATIK since there is no locking mechanism?
A: We have
patent-pending compression closure systems and seals for both TAKTIK 360 and
AQUATIK that make the cases airtight, keeping water and dust out (IP68).
Q:  Can I
take pictures/use my iPhone underwater?
A: Yes, you will. As we move closer to testing the
product, we will be able to give more specifics around underwater
functionality. 
Q:  Is there a belt clip?

A:  While a belt clip for both products are
possibilities in the future, at this time we are not currently developing these
products. Signing up for our newsletter at LUNATIK.com is your best way to stay
in the loop.
Q:  Why
Indiegogo over Kickstarter?
A: We
love Kickstarter and the fans we've met along the way, but the rules have
changed since our last project. Due to the fact that we use photo-realistic
renderings to supplement our prototypes, we were not able to utilize the
Kickstarter platform this time around.

Our future goal is to widen our reach and work with children closer to home in the USA, UK and Australia if our funding allows it. </p>
<p><b>There are so many starving children in the world, how do you choose which ones to help? </b></p>
<p>Of course we can’t help everyone, but every little bit counts. We’re collaborating with some of the world’s top children’s charities that support those in poorer nations such as <i>Feed the Hungry</i>. Every month <i>Feed the Hungry </i>aid 79,000 children and we hope to improve this even more with the 3GD initiative. </p>

<p>3GD begun with a simple intention – to try and make the world a better place. We’re starting off small and taking one step at a time. We know we can’t fix the world, but we can certainly improve it which is why we’ve decided to focus on helping the hungry to begin with. We’ve got more ideas for the coming years and hope to launch similar charitable projects in the future. </p>
<p><b>Will we receive a proof of payment? </b></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely! Everyone who does a good deed and donates will receive an official 3GD certificate stating how much they contributed. Your proof of payment will also be listed on the official website once all the deeds have been completed.</p>

When will the finished product be available for shipping? 
We’re working really hard to get everything in order and our estimated first shipping date is at the beginning of January 2015. 
How can I choose my device color? 
It’s super easy. After you’ve finalized your purchase, you’ll be sent a personalized welcome email that will ask you for your color preference. 
Where are the sponsored children based? 
As you know there are children living in poverty all over the world, however, we will be helping some of the well-known reputable children’s charities that work with children from some of the world’s harder hit countries in Africa and India. Our future goal is to widen our reach and work with children closer to home in the USA, UK and Australia if our funding allows it. 
There are so many starving children in the world, how do you choose which ones to help? 
Of course we can’t help everyone, but every little bit counts. We’re collaborating with some of the world’s top children’s charities that support those in poorer nations such as Feed the Hungry. Every month Feed the Hungry aid 79,000 children and we hope to improve this even more with the 3GD initiative. 
How do we know that other people are making money out of this? 
3GD was set up on the premise to help children and children only. Obviously, some of the money raised will have to go towards legal and manufacturing costs, however, majority of the money earned will go to those children in need. Our website will be updated on a regular basis which shows where the money raised will go and more specifically what the children will get.
Is the one month donation a one off? 
No, not at all. You’re able to donate for however many months you would like and there are a number of different pricing plans that you can sign up for that will help the children. For now we have a few different rewards for your good deeds and we aim to bring you more rewards in the future. 
Why did you decide to start such a charity without gain? 
3GD begun with a simple intention – to try and make the world a better place. We’re starting off small and taking one step at a time. We know we can’t fix the world, but we can certainly improve it which is why we’ve decided to focus on helping the hungry to begin with. We’ve got more ideas for the coming years and hope to launch similar charitable projects in the future. 
Will we receive a proof of payment? 
Yes, absolutely! Everyone who does a good deed and donates will receive an official 3GD certificate stating how much they contributed. Your proof of payment will also be listed on the official website once all the deeds have been completed.
How much do we need to pay? 
You choose the amount that suits you best. We have a number of different pricing options starting at $30. It all depends on how much goodwill you want to spread. 
What’s the difference between your children’s charity and others? 
We’re a community based charity and we strongly believe in teamwork. We don’t work as individuals and we do not offer this service to profit. Our main goal is to help the needy, but we also want you to feel good for your good deeds, which is why we offer something in return to say thank you.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Dead Battery Anxiety
  (DBA) leading cause of “NoMoPhobia”</b></p>
<p>Dead
  Battery Anxiety is everyone’s problem.  But have you heard of
  Nomophobia? Nomophobia is an abbreviation for “<b>No</b>-<b>Mo</b>bile-<b>Phone
  phobia</b>, describing a growing fear in today’s world- the fear of being
  without a mobile device or beyond mobile phone contact. In today’s hectic
  environment, people don’t just want a phone, they need a phone. The average
  mobile user would rather lose a pinky-finger than being left stranded without
  power. </p>
<p><b>Behold
  the ChargemSpot! </b>The reality is that with mobile
  compulsion and addiction on the rise, 3G and 4G high speed mobile networks
  and unlimited talk, text and web, as well as Wi-Fi neighborhoods and
  underground subway stations now offering wireless voice and data, the need
  for a universal battery recharging with relevant signage ecosystem is upon us
  now!</p>
<p><b>Support
  the ""No More Irrelevant Ads"" revolt!</b></p>
<p>If businesses truly want to engage you and be rewarded with
  your loyalty and brand appeal, shouldn’t they market to you what you really
  want to see? The next generation of personalized digital signage needs to be
  much smarter and interactive.  <b>Behold the ChargemSpot!</b> Wouldn’t you like
  to see drink and foodstuff ads that don’t misjudge you and just target you
  based on the obvious demographic and interest information?  Forget
  advertisers assuming they know you will be interested in their unlooked-for
  products. Personal social data is becoming rich enough for something much
  cooler and innovative, because it’s all about captivation not confinement!</p>

  crear publicidad para lo que realmente queremos ver? La nueva generación de
  publicidad personalizada digital debería ser mucho más inteligente e
  interactiva. <b>Le introduzco el
  ChargemSpot!  </b>No le gustaría ver publicidad de bebida y centros de comida
  que no solo usan su muy obvia información demográfica para venderle un
  producto? Olvide ya los anuncios de las  empresas que llegan a la
  conclusión errada que usted si estará interesado en sus productos no
  deseados. La data social personal se está cambiando permitiendo la creación
  de algo mucho más innovador, porque ya todo se trata sobre la información
  relevante no el confinamiento.</p>

<p><b>What Aren't You Telling
  Us?</b></p>
<p>We're
  telling you everything... just not <i>showing </i>you
  everything.</p>
<p><b>Let us
  explain:</b></p>
<p>The
  product images you see here are renderings by our industrial designer.
   We need to be able to find a good balance between the
  methodological approach and technological information we need to disclose, in
  order to make sure you understand the project and clearly see its true added
  value. </p>
<p>Our
  product exploration started with one very simple question: </p>
<p><b>How
  can the routine occurrence of charging in public also be a PRIVATE experience
  that will allow YOU to be in control of marketing messages? </b></p>
<p><span>The Chargem system involves five years of analytical
  insights gathered over time as we pondered the idea, our   long term
  vision and passion to make this a reality.  What really matters to us,
  in the end, more than idea itself, is sound execution.  And, the fact
  that we know you’ll love this product!</span></p>
<p><b>What happens if we
  surpass our funding goals?</b></p>
<p>That would be truly awe-inspiring to us!  We would get to
  see our market validated and our vision come to life with the support of fans
  who care. With the additional funds we will begin to develop marketing tools
  in preparation for launch. First month launch and operational costs includes
  installation of the ChargemSpot.  Additional funds will also kickoff
  research and development phase for the other intended mobile service
  applications. </p>
<p><b>If we don’t reach our
  funding goal?</b></p>
<p>We will remain optimistic regardless.  We will continue
  to find the means to get our product off the ground with alternate funding
  options, at least at first.  Many traditional capital sources are more
  conservative than they used to be about when and to whom they'll loan
  money.  Finding traditional investors takes work, time, and money we can
  ill afford.  We may hear a lot of “No’s”—but that just makes the first
  time we hear “Yes!” that much more exciting.</p>
<p><b>How does the system work?</b></p>
<p>For a pay-per-use fee or a Ready-On-Demand, Plug-n-Charge
  membership, you can connect your personal electronic devices to the machine
  and use your smartphone, tablet or a local user interface to activate
  charging ports remotely.  The mobile app enables the ChargemSpot system
  to recognize devices every time you plugs in to charge at the various
  ChargemSpot locations and follow your desired options set during the initial
  set up process.</p>
<p><b>What happens if my
  battery is completely dead?</b></p>
<p>In the event the phone (or mobile device) battery is
  completely dead, you may manually sign into your secured user accounts using
  the ChargemSpot system and follow the on-screen instructions to manually
  activate charging ports. </p>
<p><b>Is Mobile Battery
  technology advancing?</b></p>
<p>Mobile device makers are forced to spend enormous efforts on
  battery life marketing stunts and on creating various engineering “cheats” to
  get the maximum battery life and performance for our most favored gadgets.
  With mobile compulsion and addiction on the rise, experts agree that a
  commercially viable and safe breakthrough in battery capacity is not expected
  within the next 3 to 4 years (and will not be available to the mass market
  for a number of years after that).</p>

<p><b>Que nos están
  escondiendo?</b></p>
<p>Le
  estamos diciendo  todo sobre nuestro proyecto…pero aun no se lo
  enseñamos.</p>
<p><b>Le
  podemos explicar:  </b>Las
  imágenes que ve aquí son visuales tridimensionales creadas
  por nuestro diseñador industrial. Necesitamos encontrar un buen balance entre
  un enfoque metodológico y la información tecnológica que debemos compartir,
  para asegurar que entiende el proyecto y verdaderamente entiende su
  valor. </p>
<p>Nuestra
  exploración del producto Chargem comienza con una pregunta muy simple.</p>
<p><b>Como
  puede la rutina de recargar sus dispositivos móviles en público convertirse
  en una experiencia personal que le permitirá controlar los mensajes de
  mercadeo que recibe?</b></p>
<p> Este proyecto incluye 5 años de investigación analítica.
  Es nuestra visión a largo plazo y nuestra pasión que hace nuestro proyecto
  una realidad. Los que nos importa más que la idea es la creación de esta y la
  realidad de que sabemos que amaran este producto!</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Que pasara si sobrepasamos
  nuestras metas de Financiación?</b></p>
<p>Sería muy inspirador para nosotros. Podremos ver nuestro
  mercado validado y nuestra visión convertido en realidad con seguidores que
  verdaderamente le importa nuestro proyecto. Con los fondos adicionales
  comenzaremos a desarrollar estrategias de mercadeo y herramientas para la
  preparación del lanzamiento del producto. Los costos operacionales del primer
  mes de lanzamiento incluyen la instalación del Chargem Spot. Fondos
  adicionales también ayudaran con el desarrollo de otras aplicaciones para el
  sistema.</p>
<p><b>Que pasara si no
  logramos nuestras metas de financiación?</b></p>
<p><span>Seguiremos optimistas. Continuaremos encontrando la
  manera de lanzar nuestro producto con opciones de financiación alternas, por
  lo menos en el principio. Existen muchas fuentes tradicionales que tal vez no
  nos prestarían el dinero. Encontrar inversionistas tradicionales toma
  trabajo, tiempo y dinero que no tenemos. Tal vez escucharemos muchos “no”
  pero eso solo traerá más emoción cuando escuchemos “Si”.</span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>¿Cómo funciona el
  sistema exactamente?</b></p>

WHAT’S THE STORY?





¿CUÁL ES LA HISTORIA?







Dead Battery Anxiety
  (DBA) leading cause of “NoMoPhobia”
Dead
  Battery Anxiety is everyone’s problem.  But have you heard of
  Nomophobia? Nomophobia is an abbreviation for “No-Mobile-Phone
  phobia, describing a growing fear in today’s world- the fear of being
  without a mobile device or beyond mobile phone contact. In today’s hectic
  environment, people don’t just want a phone, they need a phone. The average
  mobile user would rather lose a pinky-finger than being left stranded without
  power. 
Behold
  the ChargemSpot! The reality is that with mobile
  compulsion and addiction on the rise, 3G and 4G high speed mobile networks
  and unlimited talk, text and web, as well as Wi-Fi neighborhoods and
  underground subway stations now offering wireless voice and data, the need
  for a universal battery recharging with relevant signage ecosystem is upon us
  now!
Support
  the ""No More Irrelevant Ads"" revolt!
If businesses truly want to engage you and be rewarded with
  your loyalty and brand appeal, shouldn’t they market to you what you really
  want to see? The next generation of personalized digital signage needs to be
  much smarter and interactive.  Behold the ChargemSpot! Wouldn’t you like
  to see drink and foodstuff ads that don’t misjudge you and just target you
  based on the obvious demographic and interest information?  Forget
  advertisers assuming they know you will be interested in their unlooked-for
  products. Personal social data is becoming rich enough for something much
  cooler and innovative, because it’s all about captivation not confinement!


...


Ansiedad de batería
  descargada, causa número 1 de “NoMoFobia”
La
  ansiedad que causa el quedar con la batería del móvil o dispositivo
  descargada, es un problema que nos afecta a todos. Pero alguna vez ha
  escuchado algo sobre Nomofobia?
La
  Nomofobia es una abreviación deNo-Móvil-fobia,
  usada para describir el temor que está afectando a más y más personas cada
  día. Es el temor de estar sin un teléfono móvil o fuera del alcance de
  contacto de una Señal celular.
Presentamos
  ChargemSpot!  La realidad es que con el crecimiento alarmante de adicción
  a teléfonos móviles, las infinitas opciones de  redes móviles de alta
  velocidad 3G y 4G,  paquetes de llamadas, mensajes de texto y navegación
  ilimitados, así como el “Wi-fi en el vecindario” y hasta en el subterráneo un
  sistema de recarga universal para baterías de dispositivos móviles se hace
  cada vez más imprescindible!
Apoye
  la protesta de “No Más Publicidad Irrelevante”!
 Si diferentes  empresas quieren hacerlos participes
  de de sus servicios y usuarios de sus productos, no deberían ellos entonces
  crear publicidad para lo que realmente queremos ver? La nueva generación de
  publicidad personalizada digital debería ser mucho más inteligente e
  interactiva. Le introduzco el
  ChargemSpot!  No le gustaría ver publicidad de bebida y centros de comida
  que no solo usan su muy obvia información demográfica para venderle un
  producto? Olvide ya los anuncios de las  empresas que llegan a la
  conclusión errada que usted si estará interesado en sus productos no
  deseados. La data social personal se está cambiando permitiendo la creación
  de algo mucho más innovador, porque ya todo se trata sobre la información
  relevante no el confinamiento.






FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:





PREGUNTAS FREQUENTES:




What Aren't You Telling
  Us?
We're
  telling you everything... just not showing you
  everything.
Let us
  explain:
The
  product images you see here are renderings by our industrial designer.
   We need to be able to find a good balance between the
  methodological approach and technological information we need to disclose, in
  order to make sure you understand the project and clearly see its true added
  value. 
Our
  product exploration started with one very simple question: 
How
  can the routine occurrence of charging in public also be a PRIVATE experience
  that will allow YOU to be in control of marketing messages? 
The Chargem system involves five years of analytical
  insights gathered over time as we pondered the idea, our   long term
  vision and passion to make this a reality.  What really matters to us,
  in the end, more than idea itself, is sound execution.  And, the fact
  that we know you’ll love this product!
What happens if we
  surpass our funding goals?
That would be truly awe-inspiring to us!  We would get to
  see our market validated and our vision come to life with the support of fans
  who care. With the additional funds we will begin to develop marketing tools
  in preparation for launch. First month launch and operational costs includes
  installation of the ChargemSpot.  Additional funds will also kickoff
  research and development phase for the other intended mobile service
  applications. 
If we don’t reach our
  funding goal?
We will remain optimistic regardless.  We will continue
  to find the means to get our product off the ground with alternate funding
  options, at least at first.  Many traditional capital sources are more
  conservative than they used to be about when and to whom they'll loan
  money.  Finding traditional investors takes work, time, and money we can
  ill afford.  We may hear a lot of “No’s”—but that just makes the first
  time we hear “Yes!” that much more exciting.
How does the system work?
For a pay-per-use fee or a Ready-On-Demand, Plug-n-Charge
  membership, you can connect your personal electronic devices to the machine
  and use your smartphone, tablet or a local user interface to activate
  charging ports remotely.  The mobile app enables the ChargemSpot system
  to recognize devices every time you plugs in to charge at the various
  ChargemSpot locations and follow your desired options set during the initial
  set up process.
What happens if my
  battery is completely dead?
In the event the phone (or mobile device) battery is
  completely dead, you may manually sign into your secured user accounts using
  the ChargemSpot system and follow the on-screen instructions to manually
  activate charging ports. 
Is Mobile Battery
  technology advancing?
Mobile device makers are forced to spend enormous efforts on
  battery life marketing stunts and on creating various engineering “cheats” to
  get the maximum battery life and performance for our most favored gadgets.
  With mobile compulsion and addiction on the rise, experts agree that a
  commercially viable and safe breakthrough in battery capacity is not expected
  within the next 3 to 4 years (and will not be available to the mass market
  for a number of years after that).

Que nos están
  escondiendo?
Le
  estamos diciendo  todo sobre nuestro proyecto…pero aun no se lo
  enseñamos.
Le
  podemos explicar:  Las
  imágenes que ve aquí son visuales tridimensionales creadas
  por nuestro diseñador industrial. Necesitamos encontrar un buen balance entre
  un enfoque metodológico y la información tecnológica que debemos compartir,
  para asegurar que entiende el proyecto y verdaderamente entiende su
  valor. 
Nuestra
  exploración del producto Chargem comienza con una pregunta muy simple.
Como
  puede la rutina de recargar sus dispositivos móviles en público convertirse
  en una experiencia personal que le permitirá controlar los mensajes de
  mercadeo que recibe?
 Este proyecto incluye 5 años de investigación analítica.
  Es nuestra visión a largo plazo y nuestra pasión que hace nuestro proyecto
  una realidad. Los que nos importa más que la idea es la creación de esta y la
  realidad de que sabemos que amaran este producto!

Que pasara si sobrepasamos
  nuestras metas de Financiación?
Sería muy inspirador para nosotros. Podremos ver nuestro
  mercado validado y nuestra visión convertido en realidad con seguidores que
  verdaderamente le importa nuestro proyecto. Con los fondos adicionales
  comenzaremos a desarrollar estrategias de mercadeo y herramientas para la
  preparación del lanzamiento del producto. Los costos operacionales del primer
  mes de lanzamiento incluyen la instalación del Chargem Spot. Fondos
  adicionales también ayudaran con el desarrollo de otras aplicaciones para el
  sistema.
Que pasara si no
  logramos nuestras metas de financiación?
Seguiremos optimistas. Continuaremos encontrando la
  manera de lanzar nuestro producto con opciones de financiación alternas, por
  lo menos en el principio. Existen muchas fuentes tradicionales que tal vez no
  nos prestarían el dinero. Encontrar inversionistas tradicionales toma
  trabajo, tiempo y dinero que no tenemos. Tal vez escucharemos muchos “no”
  pero eso solo traerá más emoción cuando escuchemos “Si”.

¿Cómo funciona el
  sistema exactamente?
Cuando se utiliza de pago por uso o subscripciones de conectar
  y cargar, se puede conectar cualquier dispositivo electrónico a la máquina de
  ChargemSpot y se utiliza su Smartphone, Tablet o la interfaz local de usuario
  para activar puertos de carga. La aplicación móvil permite que el ChargemSpot
  reconozca dispositivos cada vez que se conectan a recibir carga, en la
  diferentes locaciones con ChargemSpot, también sigue las opciones deseadas
  que fueron preseleccionadas por el usuario durante el proceso de preparación
  inicial.
¿Qué ocurre si mi
  batería está completamente descargada?
En el caso de que la batería de su dispositivo móvil este
  completamente descargada, puede manualmente ingresar a su cuenta de usuario
  utilizando el sistema CharemSpot y después debe seguir las instrucciones en
  la pantalla para manualmente activar puertos de carga.
¿Está la Tecnología de baterías
  móviles avanzando?
Los fabricantes de los dispositivos móviles se ven obligados a
  invertir grandes cantidades de esfuerzo en la creación de trucos de comercialización
  así como atajos de ingeniería para obtener máxima duración de batería y
  rendimiento para nuestros electrónicos mas preferidos. Con el crecimiento de
  la adicción móvil, los expertos reconocen que un avance seguro y
  comercialmente viable en la capacidad de baterías móviles no ocurrirá por lo
  menos por 4 años.  (Y aun así no estará disponible al público por una
  cantidad indefinible de anos después de su creación)

<p>We are two guys from Hungary, Budapest who love creating things for our tabletop wargame hobby. </p>
<p>My name is Gergely. I am running the Facebook page ""<span style=""background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/gregsters6mm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gregsters's Lab in 6mm</a>""</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> where you can already see some of my other creations</span><span>. </span></p>
<p>I did the bunker design and my friend, Daniel is doing the resin casting. </p>
<p>I am an active Epic:Armageddon player, painter, scratch-builder who ventured recently into the world of digital creation. </p>
<p><span>I started 3D not long ago as a fun side project, but after showing my first sketches I got positive feedback and decided to share this one with other gamers.</span></p>
<p>My friend Daniel has lot of experience in resin casting. On his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sebitarworkshop?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> you can check all the things he has been commissioned to cast. Without him, this would stay in digital form only.</p>
<p>We decided to give Indiegogo a try to make the models available to gamers like us and to collect funds to be able to print and cast as many parts as possible. If you support us, we will be able to realize more and more designs and launch more campaigns in the future.<br/><br/>This bunker system could be a nice addition to any 6mm scale tabletop wargame. Scenery always adds a lot of atmosphere to any game and greatly contributes to the gaming experience.</p>
<p><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>With this campaign we wish to collect funds for printing the final models at <a href=""http://www.shapeways.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shapeways </a>in Frosted Ultra Detail quality. We tried this material before and it works fine for master models. </p>
<p>We also need the funds to buy all the resin and the rubber for the molding and most likely to build more pressure chambers. </p>
<p>As we reach stretch goals, we can print even more models and add bonus items for the contributors. If we have all the masters ready, we can cast them all in resin for you.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>One campaign, two systems...wait a sec... THREE</b></h3>When we reached the 50% funding, we activated two new perks. On the right you can spot the <b>Sigma Star Systems walled compound and forward base</b>.<p>So you have more options, depending on your needs.</p>

<p><b>It is now active!</b></p>

</div>
</div><div> <p>The delays we calculated with might come from the shortage of casting material, technical problems. To avoid most of these we try to have more than one source and will have multiple pressure chambers to be able to work even if one or two might fail.

</div></div>","About us and the campaign 
We are two guys from Hungary, Budapest who love creating things for our tabletop wargame hobby. 
My name is Gergely. I am running the Facebook page ""Gregsters's Lab in 6mm"" where you can already see some of my other creations. 
I did the bunker design and my friend, Daniel is doing the resin casting. 
I am an active Epic:Armageddon player, painter, scratch-builder who ventured recently into the world of digital creation. 
I started 3D not long ago as a fun side project, but after showing my first sketches I got positive feedback and decided to share this one with other gamers.
My friend Daniel has lot of experience in resin casting. On his Facebook page you can check all the things he has been commissioned to cast. Without him, this would stay in digital form only.
We decided to give Indiegogo a try to make the models available to gamers like us and to collect funds to be able to print and cast as many parts as possible. If you support us, we will be able to realize more and more designs and launch more campaigns in the future.This bunker system could be a nice addition to any 6mm scale tabletop wargame. Scenery always adds a lot of atmosphere to any game and greatly contributes to the gaming experience.
What We Need & What You Get
 With this campaign we wish to collect funds for printing the final models at Shapeways in Frosted Ultra Detail quality. We tried this material before and it works fine for master models. 
We also need the funds to buy all the resin and the rubber for the molding and most likely to build more pressure chambers. 
As we reach stretch goals, we can print even more models and add bonus items for the contributors. If we have all the masters ready, we can cast them all in resin for you.

One campaign, two systems...wait a sec... THREEWhen we reached the 50% funding, we activated two new perks. On the right you can spot the Sigma Star Systems walled compound and forward base.So you have more options, depending on your needs.


As the tests were really good, we add now the GreyDark Industries research center to the available options.


Each square is 10mm X 10mm

See below all THREE systems in detail:
MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE ADD-ON PACK AT THE VERY END!

2. Sigma Star Systems walls
When arriving to the desert planet of Sigma IV, the first dropships immediately deployed pre-fabricated walls to block sand blows and possible hostile forces.Walled compund - 76 pieces total

Forward base - 144 pieces total


You can use these pieces to build many types of wall systems. Here is just one example what you could do:

The sensor tower in the middle will be available in the add-on pack later.


3. GreyDark Industries research center
GreyDark Industries specializes in high-tech military hardware. Their research stations are protected with top-notch troops and heavy weaponry. Usually located in desolate places, rarely can you see one with your own eyes.
We are happy that the tests came out well, so from now on, you can also get these two new perks:
GreyDark Industires small research facility
- contains 44 pieces


GreyDark Industries research center
- contains 101 pieces 


The pictures are just examples. Only your imagination is the limit what you build from the elements.

Stretch Goals

When we reached the 50% funding we started discussing the issue of the stretch goals.
We came to the conclusion, that we will abolish the stretch goals and make things available beforehand.
[As we turn into the last 40 days of the campaing, the Sigma Star Systems walled compound will become available this Wednesday. (see pictures in the gallery...) ]
It is now active!
In the last 30 days we activate the add-on packs, so you will have access to the command bunker, the sentry tower and all the other items that were planned as stretch goals. Not active yet!
[As a special surprise, we plan to add some more terrain as a perk. Here is the preview of the GreyDark Industries research station.] It is now active!







Add-On Packs

We are introducing 4 add-on packs. Each pack gives you certain number of points that you can spend on the below add-on items.
Add-on pack Nr. 1 --- 15 EUR = 20 points
Add-on pack Nr. 2 --- 25 EUR = 45 points
Add-on pack Nr. 3 --- 35 EUR = 75 points
Add-on pack Nr. 4 --- 50 EUR = 125 pointsThe add on packs have free postage included.Bonuses
We are giving you free points to spend, based on the level we reach with out campaign. Calculate with the total amount you contributed, postage included. 
Stretch goals
2000 EUR reached- you get 5% of your total pledge in points as bonus
(e.g if you spent 100 EUR, then you get 5 extra points, if you spent 20 EUR, you get 1 point) - GOAL REACHED
3000 EUR reached - you get 10% of your total pledge in points as bonus
(e.g if you spent 100 EUR, then you get 10 extra points, if you spent 20 EUR, you get 2 points) - LOCKED
4000 EUR reached - you get 15% of your total pledge in points as bonus
(e.g if you spent 100 EUR, then you get 15 extra points, if you spent 20 EUR, you get 3 points) - LOCKED
Rounding: when calculating, follow this method e.g. 1.5 is 1 but 1.6 is 2
You will be asked at the end of the campaign to list your points spending, including bonuses. We will contact each of you individually.
CLICK HERE: You can also see everything in this Google document! Includes measurements of the items too!
Please check the Google document for the exact size, as the pictures below are correct in size relative to each other!







Risks & Challenges

 The delays we calculated with might come from the shortage of casting material, technical problems. To avoid most of these we try to have more than one source and will have multiple pressure chambers to be able to work even if one or two might fail. Even if there is an overwhelming interest, we think we can adjust the production by setting up even more pressure chambers.We already have some of the basic elements printed and casting these can start when the campaign starts.
We will have help with the packing and posting, so if everything is done, we will pump out as many packages as possible per day. We will use registered shipping only to avoid untraceable, lost packages.

Simply link your Jib to any Visa or MasterCard® debit card, PayPal or bank account, pop it on your phone and tap to pay.</p><p><br/></p><p>THE JIB STORY<br/></p><p>I have a problem. I have a daughter too, however, she's not the problem. My problem is three-fold...</p><p>First, paying with your phone is a pain! To pay with your phone in America, you must first have a phone with the appropriate technology. Plus, you typically need to download, install and register a mobile application. Then, you need to perform as many as 10-12 steps such as waking your phone, entering your passcode, launching an app, logging in and usually a few other steps before you can actually pay for something using your phone.</p><p>Second, Merchants pay approximately 2%, or more, of transaction value, plus other fees, when consumers don't use cash. Currently totaling more than $50 Billion dollars each year, just in the U.S. Even though the merchant incurs the fee, they pass it along to consumers in their cost of goods sold. </p><p>Last, but not least, there is too much plastic out there and it often winds up in our oceans - polluting the environment and killing our planet! </p><p>JIB's solution is safer, faster, more convenient and more friendly to the environment than paying with cash, checks or plastic cards. Especially for my teenage daughter, whom I would rather see paying securely with her phone instead of carrying around cash.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F88667007&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F88667007&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F480907926_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>OVERVIEW</p><p>Interchange fee is a term used in the payment card industry to describe a fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions. </p><p>In recent years, interchange fees have become a controversial issue as well as the subject of regulatory and antitrust investigations. Many large merchants such as Wal-Mart have the ability to negotiate fee prices. However, while some merchants prefer cash or PIN-based debit cards, most believe they cannot realistically refuse to accept the major network-branded cards. This holds true even when their interchange-driven fees exceed profit margins. Some countries, such as Australia, have established significantly lower interchange fees, although according to a U.S. Government Accountability study, the savings enjoyed by merchants were not passed along to consumers. The fees are also the subject of several ongoing lawsuits in the United States.</p><p>For one example of how interchange functions, imagine a consumer making a $100 purchase with a credit card. For that $100 item, the retailer would get approximately $98. The remaining $2 gets divided up. About $1.75 would go to the card issuing bank (defined as interchange), $0.18 would go to Visa or MasterCard, and the remaining $0.07 would go to the retailer's merchant account provider.</p><p>Merchants should not have to pay the big banks 2% of their sales to accept plastic payments. My goal is to put some of that $50-Billion back into the economy while reducing the number of plastic cards that ultimately end up in our landfills or oceans.</p><p>Together, with your backing, we will do this!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687413/files/20140701092626-Jib_Tap_1.jpg?1404231986"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>URBAN DICTIONARY<br/></p><p>Verb.

Simply link your Jib to any Visa or MasterCard® debit card, PayPal or bank account, pop it on your phone and tap to pay.THE JIB STORYI have a problem. I have a daughter too, however, she's not the problem. My problem is three-fold...First, paying with your phone is a pain! To pay with your phone in America, you must first have a phone with the appropriate technology. Plus, you typically need to download, install and register a mobile application. Then, you need to perform as many as 10-12 steps such as waking your phone, entering your passcode, launching an app, logging in and usually a few other steps before you can actually pay for something using your phone.Second, Merchants pay approximately 2%, or more, of transaction value, plus other fees, when consumers don't use cash. Currently totaling more than $50 Billion dollars each year, just in the U.S. Even though the merchant incurs the fee, they pass it along to consumers in their cost of goods sold. Last, but not least, there is too much plastic out there and it often winds up in our oceans - polluting the environment and killing our planet! JIB's solution is safer, faster, more convenient and more friendly to the environment than paying with cash, checks or plastic cards. Especially for my teenage daughter, whom I would rather see paying securely with her phone instead of carrying around cash.OVERVIEWInterchange fee is a term used in the payment card industry to describe a fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions. In recent years, interchange fees have become a controversial issue as well as the subject of regulatory and antitrust investigations. Many large merchants such as Wal-Mart have the ability to negotiate fee prices. However, while some merchants prefer cash or PIN-based debit cards, most believe they cannot realistically refuse to accept the major network-branded cards. This holds true even when their interchange-driven fees exceed profit margins. Some countries, such as Australia, have established significantly lower interchange fees, although according to a U.S. Government Accountability study, the savings enjoyed by merchants were not passed along to consumers. The fees are also the subject of several ongoing lawsuits in the United States.For one example of how interchange functions, imagine a consumer making a $100 purchase with a credit card. For that $100 item, the retailer would get approximately $98. The remaining $2 gets divided up. About $1.75 would go to the card issuing bank (defined as interchange), $0.18 would go to Visa or MasterCard, and the remaining $0.07 would go to the retailer's merchant account provider.Merchants should not have to pay the big banks 2% of their sales to accept plastic payments. My goal is to put some of that $50-Billion back into the economy while reducing the number of plastic cards that ultimately end up in our landfills or oceans.Together, with your backing, we will do this!URBAN DICTIONARYVerb. To jib. The act of maneuvering a bicycle, skateboard, snowboard or skis in a tricky manner on top of and around structures such as stumps, rocks, stairs, railings, rooftops, etc. When you are playing around, showing off, jumping, flipping, hopping, etc. you are jibbing.Jibbing: A snowboarding style referring to the use of rails, tables, trees, etc. as obstacles. Also known as: bonking or tapping.WHAT IS JIBA world where your phone will replace your wallet is one step closer with the release of new iPhone cases from San Diego-based Jib Technologies, Inc.JIB utilizes Near Field Communications (NFC) wireless technology; this contactless payment technology feature allows users to tap their phone on contactless payment terminals without the need to physically swipe or insert a card into a point-of-sale device.That means iPhone 4/4s and iPhone 5/5s owners with JIB can ""bonk"" or ""tap"" to make payments at locations compatible with Isis, Google Wallet, Visa payWave, MasterCard PayPass and American Express ExpressPay.At Jamba Juice and Sports Authority, for example, users can tap a JIB-equipped iPhone to a checkout terminal to make a payment, rather than pulling out a credit card or cash.You're never too young for JIB! You can order JIB even if you are under 18. During the activation process you will be asked to provide the e-mail address of a parent. This parent will receive an e-mail in which they will be asked to approve the account. Once we receive their approval, your JIB account will be ready to use.With JIB, you can Tap to Pay™ with your phone.HOW JIB WORKSA tiny microchip and radio antenna embedded in your JIB case transmits your payment details wirelessly to a secure high-speed contactless reader at the point of sale. The reader then verifies your transaction with JIB's reliable network and indicates approval almost instantly.The chip can only be read when in close proximity (within a few centimeters) to the secure reader, and it must be correctly oriented to be processed. After waving your JIB in front of it, the reader will light up and beep to inform you that your information has been received and is being processed through JIB’s secure network.BACKGROUNDI once read, ""If you don't like something, change it"".  I don't like being charged $16 per month by my bank to use and keep track of my own money.  So, I created JIB to change the way people bank and keep track of their own money. According to Bank of America's web-site, their ""simple, straightforward checking"" account has a Monthly Maintenance fee of $12.00.  If you are not careful, they also hit you with a bunch of other fees.  For example, you may incur fees for using ATMs, wire transfers or monthly statements that include a printed check image.  With a Bank of America simple, straightforward checking account, you pay a $35 NSF: Returned Item fee for each transaction that does not go through.  Plus, you pay another $35 if your account stays overdrawn for 5 consecutive business days.JIB never charges you to use your own money.  In fact, JIB will reward you for using your own money with things like free music or video downloads and free skateboards or snowboards as well as discounts on the things you buy at your favorite merchants. JIB is not just a great iPhone case that enables you to Tap To Pay™.  JIB is like your bank.  In fact, JIB is better than your bank.  JIB does not charge you monthly fees.  JIB does not charge you ATM fees.  JIB does not charge you NSF fees.  JIB does not charge you ANY fees and your money with JIB is FDIC insured, up to $250,000.  Your money with PayPal is not insured by the FDIC.GETTING STARTED USING JIB1. Receive, register and activate your JIB.2. Top Up your JIB.3. Tap To Pay™.HOW TO PAY USING JIBPaying with your phone is easy.To use JIB, just tap your phone on the universal contactless symbol on the reader at checkout. When you see the green light and hear the beep, your payment has been accepted. That's it – you're ready to go.Step-1: Hold the back of your phone over the contactless symbol on the terminal at checkout.Step-2: There is no step #2. That's it! No app to download, no fumbling with cash, cards or coupons. JIB is simpler and safer to use than credit, debit or gift cards.Just look for this symbol at checkout:JIB is designed to simplify your life, save valuable time, and even help reduce fraud. Here's how: • No swiping makes checkout faster and easier• You remain in control of your phone during the transaction, reducing the risk of fraud• You'll enjoy the same multiple layers of security protection you get with traditional Visa or MasterCard debit cards, including Zero Liability, which ensures you are not responsible for fraudulent or unauthorized transactions • Transactions are processed through the same, reliable payment network as magnetic stripe transactions.JIB IS SAFEEncryption technology and JIB zero liability protection makes using contactless at checkout as safe as swiping. And contactless has built-in safeguards to help prevent unwanted purchases.Encryption—unique to every purchase—protects your transaction data, and your card or device never leaves your hand, reducing the risk of card loss or counterfeit. What’s more, safeguards are in place to bill you only once if you accidentally tap twice. So your contactless-enabled JIB card or device is one of the most secure ways to pay.JIB IS SIMPLEJIB is accepted globally at all kinds of merchants including: retail stores, fast-food restaurants, pharmacies, transit points of entry, grocery and convenience stores. You’ll even find contactless in taxicabs and vending machines.JIB contactless technology lets you make everyday purchases quickly and safely with just a tap of your phone wherever you see the universal contactless symbol. So checkout is easier than ever, and it’s faster than fumbling with cash.JIB IS SECUREJIB adds a level of security since your mobile device never leaves your hand when you Tap To Pay™.With JIB, your payment data is stored in a microchip so you never reveal your account number or PIN, and you can take it with you without carrying a wallet.JIB uses secure chip processing which means a number of layered cryptographic techniques protect you against skimming, counterfeiting, transaction replay types of fraud, and tactics such as electronic pick-pocketing.WHERE WE ARE AT NOWWe’ve paid for the design, engineering, patents and tooling.

<p><br/></p></span></h3><p><b>
</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I was 10 years old
when I started to seriously memorize the Qur’an in 1999 at Darul Ehsan in
Suffern, NY. With me, there were over 50 students attempting to memorize the
Qur’an from different age groups – kids that were as young as 6 and as old as
24. One of the biggest challenges for me while I was memorizing was that I would
constantly get the same mistakes when I reviewed previous Juz that I already
memorized. I could review a Juz 4-5 times before reciting to my teacher and I
would get minimal mistakes. However, if you asked me a week later to recite
that same Juz without reviewing, I would get mistakes, especially repeat ones.</p><b>
<br/></b><p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Millions of Qur’an memorizers ALWAYS make mistakes when
they revise </strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After
reviewing the Qur’an for over a decade, and talking to hundreds of Qur’an
memorizers, I realized that EVERYBODY faces the same issue of always making
mistakes when they revise the Qur’an (often times repeat mistakes). This is a very
big personal struggle that’s faced by all memorizers. Every Qur’an memorizer
will testify that Qur’an memorization is not nearly as difficult as retaining
what you’ve memorized. You have to constantly revise what you memorized or you
will 100% forget it.</p><p><i><br/></i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I’ve been really digging deep into this problem and
one of the main reasons that people constantly make mistakes is that they don’t
have much actionable data on their mistakes.</strong></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><br/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong></strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here’s what I mean by that. Currently, people track their mistakes by drawing lines in the Qur'an on where they are messing up. Some people draw lines while others draw circles around their mistakes, or a combination of both. Below is an example of how most people track their mistakes.    <span style=""text-align: center; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">              </span></p><p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/670248/files/20140623175723-Quran_Mistakes_Pic.png?1403571443"" src="""" style=""text-align: center; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 361.67697594501715px; height: 286px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unfortunately, this method is not so effective to strengthen our weaker memorization areas.

<p></p><p></p></div>","My Personal Story 




I was 10 years old
when I started to seriously memorize the Qur’an in 1999 at Darul Ehsan in
Suffern, NY. With me, there were over 50 students attempting to memorize the
Qur’an from different age groups – kids that were as young as 6 and as old as
24. One of the biggest challenges for me while I was memorizing was that I would
constantly get the same mistakes when I reviewed previous Juz that I already
memorized. I could review a Juz 4-5 times before reciting to my teacher and I
would get minimal mistakes. However, if you asked me a week later to recite
that same Juz without reviewing, I would get mistakes, especially repeat ones.

Millions of Qur’an memorizers ALWAYS make mistakes when
they revise 
After
reviewing the Qur’an for over a decade, and talking to hundreds of Qur’an
memorizers, I realized that EVERYBODY faces the same issue of always making
mistakes when they revise the Qur’an (often times repeat mistakes). This is a very
big personal struggle that’s faced by all memorizers. Every Qur’an memorizer
will testify that Qur’an memorization is not nearly as difficult as retaining
what you’ve memorized. You have to constantly revise what you memorized or you
will 100% forget it.
I’ve been really digging deep into this problem and
one of the main reasons that people constantly make mistakes is that they don’t
have much actionable data on their mistakes.Here’s what I mean by that. Currently, people track their mistakes by drawing lines in the Qur'an on where they are messing up. Some people draw lines while others draw circles around their mistakes, or a combination of both. Below is an example of how most people track their mistakes.                                            Unfortunately, this method is not so effective to strengthen our weaker memorization areas. Memorizers need smart data on where they need improvement and where they are making repeat mistakes.This is why Qur'an Academy was born.  It's a humble effort to provide smarter data to help folks become more effective with their memorization & revision insha'Allah!                            
  
Qur'an Academy is very flexible and is meant for anybody who wants to memorize at least some portion of the Qur’an, no
matter how old or young you are.
This technology is meant for
everybody. If you are currently in school and you want to memorize some
Qur’an effectively at your own pace, Qur’an Academy can help you. If you
are a busy working professional who wants to memorize some of the longer surahs
and you need something on-the-go that’s adaptive and effective, this is for
you. If you are a parent whose child is memorizing Qur’an or is a
Hafidh/a, Qur’an Academy can help them tremendously. You can use our
technology to perfect whatever you've memorized. We envision a world where our technology is at the forefront of helping
the common Muslim become a more effective memorizer/reviser insha’Allah!

Khalid Latif's Testimonial 
Our crowd-funding campaign of $120,000 will help us build a product that includes
the following features:
*Mutashaabihaats are similar verses in the Qur'an with subtle differences that always confuse us when we revise.Although our initial private beta will be an iPad app launch in Aug. 2014, we will scale to all devices for our public beta in Jan. 2015 (iPhone + Android)                                             Beautiful Landing PagesPainless Signup ProcessDuring the initial signup process, the user will go through a very simple experience to describe his or her goals & memorization backgrounds. You can select how much of the Qur'an you memorized along with the Mushaf you currently use (Medina, Urdu, 13, 14, 15, or 16 lines per page), so we can provide you a super flexible and convenient experience.Create Memorization Lessons Users can create memorization lessons & hide specific ayahs (verses) to test themselves.Track Mistakes
                 
Users can highlight their mistakes. If a user makes a mistake the first time, it highlights it in yellow. The second time a user mistakes a mistake, it highlights it in orange and the third time it highlights in red, indicating a common, repeat mistake. Users can also unhide their mistakes as well to test how well they know the page!Take Adaptive Quizzes                                                Users can take quizzes on specific areas of the Qur'an in order to further test their  revision. For example, a quiz may state a specific verse then ask ""what verse comes next,"" giving 4 different verses as options. There will be several questions per quiz and the quiz results will be saved in the dashboard. This adaptive quiz will get more and more sophisticated since we'll be using data from our users to tailor the behavior of our platform to best suit individual learning habits.Our Beautiful Dashboard Will Have Analytics On Your MemorizationOur dashboard will allow users to track their Qur'an memorization. They can view their progress on a certain Juz, see how many mistakes they made per Juz as well as their average quiz scores for each Juz. Through time, we will have more robust analytics that will display deep data on your memorization metrics.Here's How We'll Use The FundsOur Goals for the Next 6-12 Months
August 2014We are planning on launching our private beta in August insha’Allah
to a closed group of users to test behavior & experience. It’s very
important for us to enhance user experience before marketing to the public. Initially, we are launching an iPad app
and then we’ll scale to an iPhone + Android App by the end of the year.January 2015June 2015The complete product will be launched to the public in all devices insha'Allah!

                   ***Stretch Goal***
Here's Our Rewards System                      
Help us achieve our
vision, by making sure that Qur’an Technology is not just collecting dust in an
age of immense tech innovation!
We really need the community support and most importantly, your dua’s to execute on this beautiful vision inshAllah.

    Other Ways You Can Help
We believe EVERYONE can
be a part of the Qur'an Academy Legacy!

<h2>From the guys who brought you the worlds FIRST injection molded, low-cost, open-source 3D printer.</h2>
<p> Watch the H1 in action on <a href=""http://ustream.tv/channel/seemecnc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""SeeMeCNc Ustream Channel"">Ustream</a>. We will be posting announcements during this campaign when we will be print LIVE with the new H1.1 </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>SeeMeCNC is back, with an updated version of our H-1 3D printers</h3>
<p>  Building upon our first version of the open-source Huxley, the H-1, we have re-designed many of the more difficult parts of building and adjusting our machines to make it easier and faster to assemble. We have also improved the bearing design of the origional reprap <a href=""http;/reprap.org/huxley"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""RepRap Huxley"">Huxley</a>, from which the H in our machines name came from.  We have re-designed the bearing assemblies on all axes to use bronze linear bushings instead of the more complicated and sometimes frustrating triple plastic bearings of the origional. Along with the new design improvements, we have listened to what a lot of people were saying, and offer the awesome RAMPS 1.4 boards by Ultimachine. The RAMPS setup is for those who want a dedicated 3D printer control solution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How we are able to do it</h3>
<p>  Thanks to all of our contributors and success of our first campaign, we have managed to get set up and stock components we do not manufacture, like motors.  While we CNC machine and injection mold all our own parts in house, there is still a fair amount of stuff we have to buy in quantity to keep making the most affordable DIY 3D printer kits in the world. Also, because of these contributions, we are able to keep working on making it easier to get going in the world of 3D printing.  Another product of the success of our first campaign was, we gained a great deal of knowledge from our contributors, and are bringing many of their suggestions and ideas to life in this next version of our machine. Whether you have one of our origional H-1 machines, or are just looking to get into the world of 3D printing, we are dedicated to making it as affordable as possible, as well as maintaining a great online community for our users and builders to share their ideas, improvements and suggestions with each other.  We have a fantastic group over on our <a href=""http://forum.seemecnc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forum</a> that are always quick to help out a new member with getting up and running.  If it wasn't for the outstanding people that contributed to our first campaign, started a Yahoo Group for early members to gather and talk about their kits, and especially our users that created a great set of manuals for assembly, wiring and more. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We are almost ready to fire up the presses!</h3>
<p><br/>  We are just about done with all the designs for the injection molds, and are just about to start machining the molds for the presses.  With your help, we will be able to finish off the tooling and get to work on making these new kits.  If you already have one of our origional H-1 kits, don't worry, we aren't leaving you behind.  All of the newly designed uprades will be bolt-on upgrades for the H-1 original kits.  We are offering up a complete upgrade kit with all the new injection molded and CNC machined bearing parts, as well as just the CNC machined parts, for those of you that want to print your own plastic parts.</p>
<p>  If you are one of the origional H-1 owners, or just want to try your hand at printing our parts, and would like to start printing the plastic parts now, we're uploading ALL the new .stl files to both our .org website ( <a href=""http://seemecnc.org/download/H1-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://seemecnc.org/download/H1-1</a> for the new files ) as well as the <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/SeeMeCNC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Reprap SeeMeCNC wiki"">wiki</a> at reprap.org, where all our first H-1 files are located.  If you look to the bottom of the .stl files section, you will see the new pieces being added as we finish them.</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>So what changes did we make?</h3>
<p>  Here's a list of what changes and improvements we have made:</p>
<p>Significantly reduced hardware count.  We have removed over 150 pcs. of hardware from the original kit!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Easier to assemble</strong>.  With less parts to put together, it's naturally faster and easier to assemble.</li>
<li>
<strong>Much better linear motion design</strong>.  In place of the origional roller ball style design, we have incorporated bronze linear bushings and a ""follower"" style bearing arrangement.  The original design was overconstrained, and did have issues with binding.  The new bronze bushings help to keep the cost down, while increasing accuracy, but also make aligning the smoot bars much less critical becuase of the rolloer follower design on the opposite bar.</li>
<li>
<strong>RAMPS 1.4 is now available from SeeMeCNC</strong>.  When we started SeeMeCNC, one of our goals was to bring a more conventional CNC control into the 3D printing world.  The DIY CNC community and the 3D printing community didn't have a lot of interaction with each other.  We saw the opportunity to cross these paths, and did so by using Mach3 CNC software.  However, there's still a lot of you out there that like Arduino and the totally open-source approach to your printing needs. So, we now are able to fill both those shoes thanks to the great folks over at <a href=""http://ultimachine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ultimachine.com"">Ultimachine.com</a>.  We have been using <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/repetier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Repetier Wiki"">Repetier host and firmware</a> on our machines, and so far have had great results!</li>
<li>
<strong>NEW COLORS ! ! ! !</strong>  Many of our origional contributors asked if we could make the kits in different colors.  So, you asked for it!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>When will we be shipping?</h3>
<p>  Once we are done running the prototype machines here this next week, we will start shipping the H-1 Upgrade (machined parts and bushings only) ASAP.  They will be the first to ship, as they are the fastest for us to manufacture.  The next perk level to start shipping will be the H-1 Upgrade kit including plastic parts.  These perks will start shipping by the end of our campaign.  We already ready to run production on these. We already have our vendors ready too.  The injection molds are almost done, and if you saw us during our last campaign, you know how fast we can mold the parts!  For the first campaign, we built over 29 injection molds!  Lastly, the parts and hardware kits as well as the other complete kits will be shipping, most likely by the end of the campaign as well, as we already have most of the injection molds done, short of the new bearing design pieces. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What will shipping cost?</h3>
<p>  For all contributors in the lower 48 states, you will recieve free shipping of your perks.  For all other shipping locations, you will be billed actual shipping charges at the time of shipping.  We use USPS flat rate shipping, and they have done an excellent job at the best price available.  If you were to purchase one of the complete kits with electronics, shipping would be around $55 USD.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thank you for taking the time to visit our campaign</h3>
<p>  Whichever level perk you choose, rest assured that you are contributing to a team that has a proven record of deliver the goods.  As of May, we have over 430 machines shipped all over the world!  To top that off, even though our first campaign for our original kit topped over $24,000 (our goal was only $2500), we managed to get all those kits shipped by the end of the following month of our campaign.  We are much better prepared to handle larger orders this time, and we can't wait to ship your new SeeMeCNC H-1.1 kit to you!</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Balanbot is Open Source and
easy to assemble. It uses strong acrylic structures and keeps the robot
balanced using its center of gravity. In order to achieve high-performance, we
tests various torque-gear motors to ensure the robot will keep balance and move
flexibly even if it gets pushed suddenly.</p>

Building
the Balanbot will be so much fun for novice and experienced robotics fans!</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Typical Control Demonstration</h3>
<p>To meet different needs, we implemented several ways
to control the Balanbot. We believe the applications of Balanbot are unlimited
and up to its users and their favorite devices and platforms.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/962315/files/20141027035721-control.jpg?1414407441"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Hardware Design</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
Balanbot includes everything you need to make your own self-balancing robot:
two high torque and high speed gear motors, wheels, acrylic structures, 18650
battery holder (batteries are not included), Balance Shield, and <span>Arduino UNO-compatible board.</span><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/962355/files/20141027041254-Balaneshield.jpg?1414408374"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Balanbot uses one 5mm and two
3mm thick acrylic boards and other accessories for its main structure. The 5mm
board is used to fix the two motors. One of the 3mm boards is used to fix the
battery and the other is for an Arduino-compatible board plus the Balance
Shield.</p>

The
Balanbot is super easy to assemble and play! There are no complicated
connections and it is fast to put together. It is suitable for kids and
experienced makers as well. Thanks to the powerful Balance shield, it is much
easier now to create a balancing robot than it was before.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/962484/files/20141027051401-construct.jpg?1414412041"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Balance Shield uses an
MPU6050 which is the world’s first integrated 6-axis motion-tracking device
that combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer. It connects to the
Arduino UNO compatible board through the I2C interface. With this sensor, you
can get stable angle when the Kalman filter is used.</p>
<p>The Balance Shield also
integrated one L298P for driving motors. The L298P is a high voltage (50V),
high current (2A) dual channel full-bridge driver. It can drive inductive loads
such as relay, DC, and stepping motors.</p>

There
are also led indicators, a power switch and a buzzer on the Balance Shield. You
can even write your own code to make it play a melody.<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>A
universal serial interface is left for connecting adapters like serial
Bluetooth and serial Wi-Fi for communicating with other devices. Four IO pins
are left for connecting other sensors or RC receiver for making it more
extensible.</p>

<br/><h3>Software Design</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Balanbot software explores
almost all the resources of an Arduino UNO. The Kalman filter is used to
combine the data from the gyroscope and the accelerometer together in order to
get stable angle information. With optimized PID parameters we obtained after
several months of testing, the Balanbot now has strong stability!</p>
<p>The controller accepting control
messages comes from UART. It is easy to communicate with the Balanbot using adapters
such as Bluetooth, serial Wi-Fi, etc.</p>
<p>The coolest fact is that the
controller accepts up to 4 channel ppm signal from an RC receiver. It means
that you can control the Balanbot with a 
Remote Controller, if you have one at hand.</p>

We
created an Android App and a PC software as well. You can control your Balanbot
any way you want!</div><div>

Balanbot. Our goal is to have it ready to play
after putting together a simple kit!


Thanks for everyone to make the Balanbot success. You can continue to pre-order it on Maker Studio website. It should be ready by Dec. 15th, 2014. 

We are Makers, we design for Makers! 
The self-balancing Robot is an interesting educational
toy. Many friends around us were trying to build one, but they encountered many
challenges including the lack of the parts that are easy to assemble, suitable
electronic circuits, and sample programs. So, we decided to make a
self-balancing robot as simple as possible.
Thanks to Arduino team that almost every
maker has one Arduino board in hand. Among those Arduino boards, Arduino UNO R3
is the most universal entry-level board. Arduino UNO is open source and there
are huge of applications based it. We want to help those who has the similar idea of making a
self-balancing robot based on the Arduino UNO.

 console access while outdoors. Hence we designed this remarkable 
console adapter to meet the needs of peer users with Android and 
iPhone.
   How does it work?
 BBConsole is a Bluetooth Low Energy serial console adapter for BeagleBone Black.
 You can view all your console messages, enter commands and  
login/logout  on your BeagleBone Black from your BLE enabled 
smartphone or Tablet.BBConsole works with all new iDevices and new Android phones that support Bluetooth Low Energy (also known as BLE or Bluetooth Smart or Bluetooth 4.0).Simply plug it into J1 Port (Console Port) and start using it. There is no need to change any software settings nor any need
 to tinker with hardware on your BBB. BBConsole fits in the space between the BBB headers, so you can continue using your capes with no conflict.


  Companion Apps for Android and iOS
BBConsole Apps will be available for Android, and iOS devices. 
BBConsole Development The iOS and Android app development is in progress, below is a screen of an iPod 
with BBConsole:
And a screen of an Android Phone with BBConsole:And a screen of an iPad ->
Technical DetailsBBConsole uses Rx, Tx and Ground pins from the J1 Port, and converts the signal to Bluetooth.Your SupportThe BBConsole design is done, prototypes are made and they are being tested with BBB.

In a very short period of time, Apple iOS devices have become 
embedded in the very fabric of our lives, yet no one has developed a 
dock that will properly service these precious devices in a manner 
befitting them! Over the years I have purchased several docks for my iPhones did the job that I expect. We pay a lot of money for our Apple mobile devices and we deserve a dock that is manufactured to the same specifications of our devices. 
With no suitable products available to me, I decided to develop my own... but not just any dock, this one would have to be unique!I started by buying a 3D Printer from Makerbot to start making prototypes...After almost a year of research and development, making sure that our designs would accommodate both 30 pin and Lightning cables, the product is finally ready for market and the Apple enthusiast in each of us.  Please join us on our adventure to eliminate tangled and lost cords and to enhance your Apple iOS device experience!We call it the CORE... We hope you like it! 
The CORE (the Dock/Viewing Stand for every Apple iOS device ever made)
The CORE was designed to charge with standard Apple iOS charging cables and to provide exclusive features unavailable on competing products; 
-They’re BIGGER and HEAVIER than the Elevation Dock to support both an iPhone and an iPad. The
 increased size provides the weight and stability required for 
effortless “one-hand docking and undocking” and will stay on the table 
where it belongs, rather than in the air attached to your device.-The CORE will charge every APPLE iOS Device ever made including iPhones, iPads and iPods regardless of their charging format. 
-Each Aluminum CORE will easily accommodate an iPhone and an iPad 
with or without a case. It will handle most cases 5.0 mm thick or less (on bottom or back). A
 custom insert gives additional support for an iPad without a case. The CORE is also made to a width that will easily accommodate the rumored iPhone 6 sizes.-Every CORE will provide “Simultaneous Charging” for up to two Apple iOS devices. -The ""Viewing Stand"" provides a landscape viewing option that's ideal for watching most anything. -The ""Swivel Plate"" will allow you to turn your dock to achieve the perfect viewing angle. -Unlike the Elevation Dock, which requires 13 things to secure a single cord… you’ll only need your hands to set up the CORE. -The CORE provides a wall-mounting option that will provide a custom viewing experience. 
- Multiple devices are normally charged individually using separate 
cords which are often tangled or misplaced. With the CORE, worrying 
about cords will become a thing of the past! Bending over for tangled cords can be a real pain!-Every CORE follows more than 20 finishing and quality control procedures to deliver a superior finish that’s 2nd to none! Apple Quality FinishesThe CORE comes in two distinct designs; and is manufactured to meet 
the highest quality standards available. We manufacture them from 
aircraft grade aluminum using the same processes that Apple uses to 
manufacture its uni-body products. We offer them in a bead blasted finish or one of three (3) anodized color finishes as well. REWARD LEVELS









APPLE enthusiasts around the world prefer clean, simple and elegant 
products, and expect superior quality and user-friendly features 
unmatched by competing products. FEATURESAfter many months of design,
 prototyping, focus groups and multiple redesigns we believe that we’ve 
accomplished that with the CORE! 
It’s the BEST docking solution available for any Apple iOS device, no matter where you live. It's
 perfect for the office or any room in the house and it's sure to 
provide you with effortless charging and hands-free viewing experiences 
for years to come. ANY BACKERS living in the local areas of Las Vegas/Henderson NV, USA and Windsor, ON, Canada, you will receive a refund for the costs associated with shipping if you are willing to pick up your orders from us when they are ready. We expect to be shipping on December 1st, 2014 if the project reaches its funding goal. We’re very excited about the CORE and we hope that you are too. If so, we need your help to bring them to market. Thank you for taking the time to review our project and we really appreciate your support.",15.0,3,"1 Campaign

With ClutchIt you can avoid clutter and bulk while adding convenience to your life.ClutchIt utilizes rotating ball joints with super-powered magnetic ends to give you a solid hold with amazing degrees of flexibility. Now you can mount your phone to any surface with the help of adhesive film and our unique magnetic pads! And surfaces that are already metallic? All you have to do is place ClutchIt on your table, wall, or more and you've got a reliable phone mount that is sleek, sexy and easy to use!The inspiration behind the ClutchIt came from the creator's father, who is an Uber driver in New York City. ""The current phone holders out there are so dangerous!"", says Hong, who has experienced firsthand what can happen when you use phone holders that can fall down, obstruct views, or block vents. ""Once when we were driving, the suction cup phone holder fell from the windshield and, distracted by trying to catch the phone, we almost hit a truck!"". No more dangerous phone holders, says Hong. ClutchIt is in Production!
Frustrated by the lack of a phone holder that takes up minimal space, is strong and supportive, and looks good, Hong set out to design his own phone mount, holder and more.Clutchit by itself is a phone stand - no metal disc needed!We design with quality and user-friendliness in mind. Making sure that it holds even the heaviest of phones and even smaller tablets at any angle.  Clutchit itself weights about half a pound, so you feel the weight and quality of clutchit, when you first hold it in your hands, you will want to play with it for hours, thinking of creative ways and angles to Clutchit!ClutchIt is Indestructible!ClutchIt survived a rigorous lethal weapon test by Dan Bilzerian . ClutchIt is elegant and playful!ClutchIt! fits into a wide array of lifestyles. The device itself comes in 5 colors to match your style. These options were developed with the new iPhone in mind, so you can be sure to be ahead of the latest trends.  Every ClutchIt comes with clear adhesive films and magnetic metal pads. The adhesive films provide a way to prepare any surface to become magnetic, without the fear of ruining the material or leaving an unwanted, sticky residue.The metal pads adhere to the film, making any surface you want metallic! They are easy to remove, but still powerful. You can't always plan for when you'll need a convenient place to hold your phone, but with the ClutchIt you'll always be ready! ClutchIts are strong enough to hold the biggest smartphones and even small tablets!

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524715929/fsdlbj70ej9soecy802x.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:40px;""/><div style=""background-color: #edeff2;padding:40px;"">
<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">Other phones had either not adapted to gaming (some looked and felt like bricks) or were simply iPhone copycats. That’s when we decided to create a design impressive enough to leave a mark on the smartphone industry.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">It took more than a hundred design iterations to find the perfect look for Red Magic.

<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">Not to mention the multi-layered cooling system packed into the device that boosts gameplay optimisation.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">So there’s no need for a trade-off between aesthetics and performance, after all.</p>

It was impossible to include clunky cooling fans without compromising on the smartphone’s slim design.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">So, we took a cool-headed approach to keep the temperature down. We packed in three special technologies to keep our device cool to the touch—all without fans.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">Firstly, the extra layers of graphite help take heat away from the processor.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/redmagic-gg/indiegogo/3-layers.gif"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom:40px;""/><p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">On top of that, the convex-styled back adds more surface area to dissipate heat faster. Basically, the more surface area, the faster conduction and convection can take place.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">Finally, the three cooling ports on the back of the device allow for better hot–cool air exchange.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Monda','Benton Sans','Helvetica','sans-serif';font-size: 16px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:20px;"">Combine these three components and what you get is the coolest phone.

You can now order Red Magic from https://redmagic.gg--------------------------------------------------------------Imagine a device that strikes the balance between sleek, a natural fit hardware and fully optimised software.
Now stop imagining: The Red Magic is a reality.
Key Features and Benefits

//Design    //
While at the drawing board, we faced the challenge of creating a design that not only looked great but could be ergonomic, distinctive and ensure high performance.

Other phones had either not adapted to gaming (some looked and felt like bricks) or were simply iPhone copycats. That’s when we decided to create a design impressive enough to leave a mark on the smartphone industry.
It took more than a hundred design iterations to find the perfect look for Red Magic. We have created a sleek smartphone that’s comfortable to hold, with tactile buttons rounding out the contours.
Not to mention the multi-layered cooling system packed into the device that boosts gameplay optimisation.
So there’s no need for a trade-off between aesthetics and performance, after all.


LED Strip
16 million colours. Four different lighting effects. One RGB LED strip. Because...Well, why not?It just looks awesome! 
//Performance    //
For mobile gaming, it’s not about having the fastest chipset but what will deliver the most stable and optimised experience.
That’s what brought us to the Qualcomm® Snapdragon 835™. Through months of development, we worked to optimise this chipset to strike the perfect balance between performance, battery life and temperature. So you can jump straight into the game knowing you have the best hardware suited for the job.
Data Sheet: 
GameBoost Mode    //
It wasn’t enough to have enhanced software and hardware for Red Magic. We needed something to give gameplay an extra jolt of power.
GameBoost delivers a more stable framerate, faster app loading and learns from your usage. Plus, it turns off any distracting notifications during gameplay, allowing you to play at your very best.  GameBoost: 
 Network switch protection
 Restricts app notifications
 Blocks unintended-button press

3,800 mAh Battery    //
Through rigorous lab testing, we managed up to seven hours of playing Arena of Valor from the Red Magic’s 3,800 mAh battery.
This smart, high-density battery is built for endurance and charges quickly—perfect for on-the-go gaming.

Multi-layered Cooling Technology    // But we quickly hit an obstacle. It was impossible to include clunky cooling fans without compromising on the smartphone’s slim design.
So, we took a cool-headed approach to keep the temperature down. We packed in three special technologies to keep our device cool to the touch—all without fans.
Firstly, the extra layers of graphite help take heat away from the processor. On top of that, the convex-styled back adds more surface area to dissipate heat faster. Basically, the more surface area, the faster conduction and convection can take place.
Finally, the three cooling ports on the back of the device allow for better hot–cool air exchange.
Combine these three components and what you get is the coolest phone. Literally! At its peak temperature, it’s almost ten degrees cooler than an iPhone X. 
//Other Features    //
 DISPLAY
 CAMERA  AUDIO
For the audiophile, DTS Technology and a Smart Amplifier system enable you to enjoy an expanded soundstage filled with breathtaking clarity and enhanced bass. We have also integrated a DAC to experience clear, crisp music for a more immersive sound experience.

01Software Timeline
We’re proud of our Red Magic smartphone. But that doesn’t mean it’s ready to be hastily sent out untested. We are perfectionists, after all.
On April 14 we placed our devices in the hands of experts for rigorous daily driving usage testing, and from there we’ll be implementing their feedback over the next few weeks.
While they've found a couple of bugs with some of the features, the Red Magic team is working to have your device fully optimised from the day you receive it. And in case some smartphones are shipped out without those features, we promise to add them back in as soon as the glitches are fixed.
We’re expecting to have a stable build around end of May or early June should everything go to plan. If the timeline changes, we’ll keep you in the loop. If you want to help us test, please reach out to us with your order number and you could be added to our testing group.
Thank you for your support and patience.

Best of all, we’ll exchange your tester phone for the real deal once it’s ready. Just keep in mind that users may have limited 4G connectivity in the region.

<li>Bluetooth or WiFi?
    <ul>
<li>
<a name=""a1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>I've seen other video glasses that are wifi, Custos are Bluetooth, what's the difference?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Of course, we think the difference is HUGE.  But objectively, the primary difference is Custos with Bluetooth 4.0 supports your smartphone so you can make and take phone calls, use the voice activated calling features of your phone, listen to playlists, satellite services, etc.  WIFI video glasses don't have that functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""a2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>But with WIFI I can stream to my smartphone, that sounds pretty cool, right?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it does and in practice it sometimes is, But (there had to be a but, right?)  When you're on the slopes skiing or snowboarding or in the mountains hiking, biking, flyfishing or on that once in a lifetime trip enjoying the quiet grandeur of nature, do you have WIFI?  One of the reasons we chose Bluetooth (over wifi) is we felt Bluetooth offered greater functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""a3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b> Custos are Bluetooth 4.0 and the most recent iteration is Bluetooth 4.2 is there a difference?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>While there is a difference between versions 4.0 and 4.2 the vast majority of users will not notice a difference and chances are that if you do not have the absolute latest smart phone, there is no noticeable difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pricing and Package<ul>
<li>
<a name=""b1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>I've been seeing all kinds of different pricing in campaigns, what are the hidden costs in your perks?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>There are none!  Kurt here, my grandma was always saying ""The price should be the price"" and I agree, so the price is the price.  There are no hidden costs in our perks.  All of our perks include shipping EVERYWHERE.  Does that mean we have ""jacked-up"" the price to account for the shipping?  No, we have a fantastic supply chain in place and I just made the decision that we'd make a little less on the ""internationals"" due to higher shipping, and hopefully that is somewhat offset because people appreciate not being ""nickel and dimed"" or ""ala-carted""  Our Pricing Philosophy with Custos is: the price is the price</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""b2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>There are less expensive video glasses available.
        </b></a><ul>
<li>Straight cost?  Yes you can buy a pair of video glasses for less.  That said, when you consider the overall value of what's in our CrowdFunder package, the features and tech packed into Custos, we believe Custos offers a super premium value over what is currently available.  And when you compare what you get with (whomever ""they"" are) against what is included in the Crowdfunder, we feel you'll agree Custos is a great value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""b3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>What exactly is included in the CrowdFunder?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>Similar and consistent with our pricing philosophy we decided to put everything we could imagine offering into the package we offer on Indiegogo.  The regular retail package will only include Custos, Carrying Case, 8GB mini sd card, instructions, charging cord and cleaning cloth and have a MSRP of $249.95 and will be available with an Accessory Pack which will have the additional 5 lens colors and 32GB mini sd card and cost $49.95 for a combined MSRP of $299.  For our Indiegogo supporters we stuffed it all into the CrowdFunder, which has:  Custos, Protective Carrying Case, 8GB And 32 GB mini sd cards with adapters, all 6 lenses, instructions, mini USB charging cord and cleaning cloth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Video Camera-Camera
    <ul>
<li>
<a name=""c1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Can I adjust the quality or resolution of the video?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>The great thing with Custos is you actually have the option and can move down in resolution, while a video cam with lesser resolution will find it difficult to move up in resolution.  Custos video is 1440 x 1080p and using players like Windows Media Player, Real Player etc you can render in lower resolution.
            The still pictures are coming out of the Custos camera at 4480 x 3360p (15 MP) and the resolution can be easily adjusted down with a basic photo editor. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""c2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Can I adjust the focus, zoom?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>One of the universal limitations of video eyewear is they are fixed focus and for a number of reasons, e.g. there's not enough room to accommodate the lens, the chip set necessary, the battery power needed to name just a few.  All of these would yield a design that would trend heavily away from the minimalist design we were looking for. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""c3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Will I be able to take video at night?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>You will need an external lighting source and then you can, though in either case the audio will be fantastic.  The glasses take full advantage of, but are limited to natural and ambient lighting, i.e. they do not have their own light source</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bluetooth
    <ul>
<li>
<a name=""d1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>I have an iPhone, Android, windows device, are Custos compatible with my device?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Custos are Bluetooth 4.0 enabled and any device that can connect with Bluetooth 4.0 is going to be compatible.
            Custos are easy to ""Pair"" with your device.  The instructions have a step by step process and by the time Custos ship, the website, Custos.co will have a whole section of video tutorials including ""pairing"" Custos with your device.
            It's as easy as pushing a button and listening to a voice prompt.  There's even a little blue light that will help you on your way </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""d2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>What's the wireless range of Custos?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>Custos will offer reliable connectivity within a wireless range of 33 ft (10m) line of sight.</li>

<li>Operation &amp; Use
    <ul>
<li>
<a name=""e1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>There are so many functions in Custos, but there seem to be only a few tiny buttons, can they really work to control so many different functions?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Yes, If you can push a button, push and hold a button for 1, 3 and 5 seconds, you can operate Custos and we agree, it is almost like magic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""e2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Is there an instruction manual with step by step how to instructions for Custos glasses?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the instruction booklet is included in your CrowdFunder package.  Additionally a copy of the word doc will be available at custos.co by the time Custos ships.
            Custos.co will also have video tutorials on the operation and use of Custos. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""e3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Is there a Web site where I can find detailed instructions?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you will be able to find instructions and video tutorials—many of them actually shot with Custos—at custos.co/tutorials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""e4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Custos touts 6 different colors of interchangeable lenses, how easily are the lenses switched out and how secure are they in place?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>We are trying to upload a GIF file showing just how easy it is to switch the lenses in and out.  You should be able to view it in the additional information section here.   We will also post that GIF and a full tutorial on the website, custos.co/tutorials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""e5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Custos are sunglasses, don't I just need the gray and the REVO lenses?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>One of the very surprising things the field testers found is the versatility the additional lenses provide which makes Custos much more than just a pair of sunglasses.  We have used them:
            as safety glasses doing woodworking and shooting a tutorial (Hi_Viz Yellow)
            Gaming (Hi Viz Yellow, Rose and Blue lenses)
            at the computer, working and shooting screen capture tutorials and videos (Rose is also the best color to mitigate eye strain associated with computer screen viewing over long periods of time)
            Indoor video and pics (Clear lenses)
            These are just a few of the uses showcasing Custos' versatility </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""e6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>How long will the Custos battery last?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>Custos are equipped with a rechargeable lithium ion battery that delivers two (2) hours of continuous video recording and up to 4 hours play in Bluetooth (replenish charge completely in 2 hours). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""e7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>How do I charge Custos?
        </b></a><ul>
<li>Each Custos is shipped with a standard micro-USB charging cable. You simply plug your Custos into a USB port in your computer or wall via the micro-USB charging cable and your unit will be fully charged in about two hours.</li>
</ul>

<li>Glasses
    <ul>
<li>
<a name=""f1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Do they come in different sizes? I have a small head.
        </b></a><ul>
<li>Custos come in just the one size.  And while one size does not fit all, we have been amazed how the sport design accommodates a large range in sizes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name=""f2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Can you give me a brand that has comparable quality lenses? I don't understand all the technical lens specifications.  Who uses TAC &amp; PC Lenses?</b></a>
<ul>
<li>Tri-Acetate Cellulose (TAC) and Poly-Carbonate (PC) are industry standards for scratch and shatter resistance in light-weight design and applications.  Both lens materials are preferred across a wide array of manufacturers too many to list. </li>
</ul>

A few notes about the Super Lux Perks

The Lake Trout, the Bull Trout and the Golden Trout  have delivery dates in June 2016 because that's the best fishing here in Colorado.  You'll have your Custos Sunglasses delivered within the same time frame as everyone else, the trips will be delivered June or later, 2016.
You'll be fishing as Kurt's Guests at an exclusive, private catch and release club on over 100 acres, multiple  lakes, over a mile of stream.  A day includes transfers to and from fishing, all meals and flies.  You will hook fish, probably some very big trout. If you like the idea of a 20""+ trout on a dry fly this is for you!  2 days is double the fun.





Specifics on what to bring, gear, tackle, etc will be provided to the supporters buying these perks.  We promise to take very good care of you and your guest.


Lake Trout does not include any travel arrangements or accommodations, we can provide suggestions, but that cost is not included.
Bull Trout and Golden  Trout do include air and accommodations and we will make those arrangements, once made the dates will be firm, though of course we will try to accommodate all reasonable requests.
All trips expire Nov 30th, 2016.

Project Timeline



Custos Founder Interviewed by Crowd Funding Journalist/Podcaster Jonathan Nadeau
Our first press interview with Jonathan Nadeau of Crowd Funding Cast.
Jonathan has been actively covering the crowdfunding phenomenon for the past 3+ years and has been in the trenches consulting on over 100+ campaigns.
He definitely knows his crowdfunding so after he contacted me and I completed  my own due diligence I was thrilled to be able to sit down with him in skype for an interview for his podcast.

About the Golden Ticket







Team Custos






Risks and Challenges
We currently have a working prototype and we've finalized most of the production details with our manufacturing partners.
By intention and design, at this point everything we have incorporated into Custos we are set to deliver.  That is the benefit of rigorous field testing.  We did not want customers and supporters to be guinea pigs.  There won't be any delays for features because we're marketing what we have now to deliver.  We believe that's the fair and right way to respect our supporters.
Could there be a manufacturing delay?  There is always that possibility.  Our order will go in in December and that should be great timing.  
We are very confident that given your support, we'll  order on time, manufacture and produce a quality product to the exact specs we have marketed or better and deliver on time or before.
As developments occur we will keep our supporters updated via the Indiegogo system and provide timely notification of any delays.  Though it is our very sincere intention to notify our supporters we are ahead of schedule.  We like sharing good news!

Bluetooth or WiFi?
    

I've seen other video glasses that are wifi, Custos are Bluetooth, what's the difference?

Of course, we think the difference is HUGE.  But objectively, the primary difference is Custos with Bluetooth 4.0 supports your smartphone so you can make and take phone calls, use the voice activated calling features of your phone, listen to playlists, satellite services, etc.  WIFI video glasses don't have that functionality.



But with WIFI I can stream to my smartphone, that sounds pretty cool, right?

Yes, it does and in practice it sometimes is, But (there had to be a but, right?)  When you're on the slopes skiing or snowboarding or in the mountains hiking, biking, flyfishing or on that once in a lifetime trip enjoying the quiet grandeur of nature, do you have WIFI?  One of the reasons we chose Bluetooth (over wifi) is we felt Bluetooth offered greater functionality.



 Custos are Bluetooth 4.0 and the most recent iteration is Bluetooth 4.2 is there a difference?
        
While there is a difference between versions 4.0 and 4.2 the vast majority of users will not notice a difference and chances are that if you do not have the absolute latest smart phone, there is no noticeable difference.




Pricing and Package

I've been seeing all kinds of different pricing in campaigns, what are the hidden costs in your perks?
        
There are none!  Kurt here, my grandma was always saying ""The price should be the price"" and I agree, so the price is the price.  There are no hidden costs in our perks.  All of our perks include shipping EVERYWHERE.  Does that mean we have ""jacked-up"" the price to account for the shipping?  No, we have a fantastic supply chain in place and I just made the decision that we'd make a little less on the ""internationals"" due to higher shipping, and hopefully that is somewhat offset because people appreciate not being ""nickel and dimed"" or ""ala-carted""  Our Pricing Philosophy with Custos is: the price is the price



There are less expensive video glasses available.
        
Straight cost?  Yes you can buy a pair of video glasses for less.  That said, when you consider the overall value of what's in our CrowdFunder package, the features and tech packed into Custos, we believe Custos offers a super premium value over what is currently available.  And when you compare what you get with (whomever ""they"" are) against what is included in the Crowdfunder, we feel you'll agree Custos is a great value.



What exactly is included in the CrowdFunder?
        
Similar and consistent with our pricing philosophy we decided to put everything we could imagine offering into the package we offer on Indiegogo.  The regular retail package will only include Custos, Carrying Case, 8GB mini sd card, instructions, charging cord and cleaning cloth and have a MSRP of $249.95 and will be available with an Accessory Pack which will have the additional 5 lens colors and 32GB mini sd card and cost $49.95 for a combined MSRP of $299.  For our Indiegogo supporters we stuffed it all into the CrowdFunder, which has:  Custos, Protective Carrying Case, 8GB And 32 GB mini sd cards with adapters, all 6 lenses, instructions, mini USB charging cord and cleaning cloth.




Video Camera-Camera
    

Can I adjust the quality or resolution of the video?
        
The great thing with Custos is you actually have the option and can move down in resolution, while a video cam with lesser resolution will find it difficult to move up in resolution.  Custos video is 1440 x 1080p and using players like Windows Media Player, Real Player etc you can render in lower resolution.
            The still pictures are coming out of the Custos camera at 4480 x 3360p (15 MP) and the resolution can be easily adjusted down with a basic photo editor. 



Can I adjust the focus, zoom?
        
One of the universal limitations of video eyewear is they are fixed focus and for a number of reasons, e.g. there's not enough room to accommodate the lens, the chip set necessary, the battery power needed to name just a few.  All of these would yield a design that would trend heavily away from the minimalist design we were looking for. 



Will I be able to take video at night?
        
You will need an external lighting source and then you can, though in either case the audio will be fantastic.  The glasses take full advantage of, but are limited to natural and ambient lighting, i.e. they do not have their own light source




Bluetooth
    

I have an iPhone, Android, windows device, are Custos compatible with my device?

Custos are Bluetooth 4.0 enabled and any device that can connect with Bluetooth 4.0 is going to be compatible.
            Custos are easy to ""Pair"" with your device.  The instructions have a step by step process and by the time Custos ship, the website, Custos.co will have a whole section of video tutorials including ""pairing"" Custos with your device.
            It's as easy as pushing a button and listening to a voice prompt.  There's even a little blue light that will help you on your way 



What's the wireless range of Custos?
        
Custos will offer reliable connectivity within a wireless range of 33 ft (10m) line of sight.




Operation & Use
    

There are so many functions in Custos, but there seem to be only a few tiny buttons, can they really work to control so many different functions?

Yes, If you can push a button, push and hold a button for 1, 3 and 5 seconds, you can operate Custos and we agree, it is almost like magic.



Is there an instruction manual with step by step how to instructions for Custos glasses?

Yes, the instruction booklet is included in your CrowdFunder package.  Additionally a copy of the word doc will be available at custos.co by the time Custos ships.
            Custos.co will also have video tutorials on the operation and use of Custos. 



Is there a Web site where I can find detailed instructions?

Yes, you will be able to find instructions and video tutorials—many of them actually shot with Custos—at custos.co/tutorials



Custos touts 6 different colors of interchangeable lenses, how easily are the lenses switched out and how secure are they in place?

We are trying to upload a GIF file showing just how easy it is to switch the lenses in and out.  You should be able to view it in the additional information section here.   We will also post that GIF and a full tutorial on the website, custos.co/tutorials



Custos are sunglasses, don't I just need the gray and the REVO lenses?

One of the very surprising things the field testers found is the versatility the additional lenses provide which makes Custos much more than just a pair of sunglasses.  We have used them:
            as safety glasses doing woodworking and shooting a tutorial (Hi_Viz Yellow)
            Gaming (Hi Viz Yellow, Rose and Blue lenses)
            at the computer, working and shooting screen capture tutorials and videos (Rose is also the best color to mitigate eye strain associated with computer screen viewing over long periods of time)
            Indoor video and pics (Clear lenses)
            These are just a few of the uses showcasing Custos' versatility 



How long will the Custos battery last?
        
Custos are equipped with a rechargeable lithium ion battery that delivers two (2) hours of continuous video recording and up to 4 hours play in Bluetooth (replenish charge completely in 2 hours). 



How do I charge Custos?
        
Each Custos is shipped with a standard micro-USB charging cable. You simply plug your Custos into a USB port in your computer or wall via the micro-USB charging cable and your unit will be fully charged in about two hours.




Glasses
    

Do they come in different sizes? I have a small head.
        
Custos come in just the one size.  And while one size does not fit all, we have been amazed how the sport design accommodates a large range in sizes.



Can you give me a brand that has comparable quality lenses? I don't understand all the technical lens specifications.  Who uses TAC & PC Lenses?

Tri-Acetate Cellulose (TAC) and Poly-Carbonate (PC) are industry standards for scratch and shatter resistance in light-weight design and applications.  Both lens materials are preferred across a wide array of manufacturers too many to list. 



How heavy are they?

The specs say 60 grams or about 2.2 oz. and because of the sport design which very evenly distributes weight between the nose pads and the side arms, Custos are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.



Are they suitable for active sports and not fall off my face?

Yes, Custos are specifically designed for sport and active use.



Can I comfortably fit the thicker arms on the side of my head while wearing a bicycle helmet?
        
Part of the great design of Custos is that the part of the arms that come in contact with the side of your head and over your ears is flat and relatively thin and yes, they will fit nicely with a helmet. 



Is there a prescription lens option?
        
At the time the Custos campaign was launched there was no prescription lens option.
            We are continuing talks with the manufacturer to create an adapter that could accept prescription lenses.  Potentially this remains as a possibility for a ""stretch"" goal, but overall feasibility has not yet been determined. 



Are the frames available in other colors, is it black glossy or matte?

The frames are available in the matte black as shown.  No additional frame colors are available at this time.




Perks & Delivery
    

The Custos campaign indicates Worldwide Shipping is available, at what cost?

As part of our pricing policy where ""The Price is the Price"" we decided to get rid of any potential confusion and include the shipping in the price, so that yes, the price is actually the price.
            Custos has a great supply chain set up so shipping worldwide is included.



How will my Custos be shipped?
        
Most likely, in the U.S. and Canada, shipping will be handled via the U.S. Postal Service. International shipments will depend on region, but Custos has distribution partners worldwide set up to accommodate all of our supporters. 



How will I know when my Trekz Titanium™ has shipped?
        
You will receive an email with a tracking number when your Custos ships. 



How long will shipping take?
        
In the U.S., Canada, once a shipping confirmation is sent, you should receive your package in 3-5 business days. International supporters can expect to receive packages within 4-7 business days. Expedited shipping is not available through our Indiegogo campaign.



Can I get Custos for the Holidays?

Custos will make an outstanding gift for the Holidays.  And because we know it's always much more fun and REAL to actually have something to give and to open as a gift, we created the ""Golden Ticket"" for just this situation.
            The Golden Ticket is explained here in the campaign and on the website at custos.co.  We hope you agree this is a great solution that allows you to give the gift of Custos and allows us (and you) to stay within the terms and framework of the campaign on Indiegogo

            Many of these require more a sophisticated chip-set, which requires more miniaturization of the chip set, which is a complex, expensive and time consuming process.

<h2><strong>What we have already done for the project?</strong></h2>
<p>We
are developing a cloud service for contact management. The beta is already
available at <a href=""http://take5.mobi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://take5.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://take5.co</a>. This strong foundation and experience will help

reliable.</p>

<h2><strong>What we are going to do?</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We are going to develop and deploy an
Android mobile app and cloud service to allow you to create and store an interactive
mobile business card directly on your Android smartphone.</p>
<p>The basic application and cloud service
will be available for free. Anyone will be able to create, share and store attractive,
interactive mobile business cards on their Android smartphone.</p>

We will test our app for Android
2.3 or higher. For the moment we are not working on a tablet version but we plan
that it will come soon after the smartphone version is up and running.<p></p>
<h2>What is about other mobile platforms?</h2>
<p>Yes,
we are going to develop Take5.mobi app for iOS! And we are thinking about apps
for Windows Phone, Blackberry and even the Firefox OS. Right now we are

*********************************************


What is output of the project?

Android app + cloud service = Your cool and interactive mobile business card.


Why do you need my money?

You money is your vote.


What do I get for my money?

You get cool and interactive mobile business cards one month before official release and more.



*********************************************


With your support our team aims to develop your attractive and interactive mobile business cards.
The problem
Paper business cards are cool but not interactive.

 
Contacts on your mobile are interactive but not cool.

 
Take5.mobi is Android app and cloud service providing cool and interactive mobile business cards

How does it work?
1. Create a cool interactive business card right on your Android device.

2. Share your cool and interactive business cards with your friends and customers 

3. Store
and access mobile business cards on your Android smartphone.

What we have already done for the project?
We
are developing a cloud service for contact management. The beta is already
available at http://take5.co. This strong foundation and experience will help
us to provide mobile applications and web services for better contact
management that are not only pleasant to look at but also functional and
reliable.

What we are going to do?

We are going to develop and deploy an
Android mobile app and cloud service to allow you to create and store an interactive
mobile business card directly on your Android smartphone.
The basic application and cloud service
will be available for free. Anyone will be able to create, share and store attractive,
interactive mobile business cards on their Android smartphone.

We will test our app for Android
2.3 or higher. For the moment we are not working on a tablet version but we plan
that it will come soon after the smartphone version is up and running.
What is about other mobile platforms?
Yes,
we are going to develop Take5.mobi app for iOS! And we are thinking about apps
for Windows Phone, Blackberry and even the Firefox OS. Right now we are
concentrating on Android app, but we are convinced that everyone should be able
to create and share their own mobile business cards. If you are not Android
user you can leave your email here and we will let you know about our efforts for other mobile
platforms.
Who we are?

We are the developers behind the web
service Take5.mobi. We are from the beautiful city of Saint
Petersburg in Russia. We have more than 10 years experience in Java & Web
technologies. We speak Russian, English and a little Japanese.
We were so frustrated with existing
solutions that we started to work on a web service and mobile application for
better contact management.
Once the idea of cool and interactive
mobile business cards came up, we decided we could and should take things
beyond a plain-vanilla contact management service.


Why we need your support?

With your help we can speed up the
development process and the business cards of the future will be available
sooner for you and for the rest of the world.
We will spend your money to develop,
test and deploy a better and more reliable Android mobile application and cloud
service.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Zuggol is a mobile application aimed to make goal achieving more rewarding and fun.  Sometimes achieving a goal can feel like a chore, but with this application we wish to change that.  In order for the process of achieving a goal to feel fun and more rewarding we surround people with others that share the same goals and ambitions, and together they can accomplish a goal. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Before we flat out tell you guys how much money we desire for our project, let us first start with a story.  The three founders of the company come from all over the bay area, and carry out most of their work in San Francisco, CA, a city that is full of young ,passionate, and tech savvy individuals.  The idea for the project came about in 2010 when co-founder Chris Cruz noticed it was a lot easier to stay committed to his diet when he posted pictures of himself online and received virtual admiration and approval from his peers.  From that day forward Zuggol has taken that premise and ran with it.  Now back to why we need the money.  The team here at zuggol have a clear and precise plan to launch the application by fall.  $35,000 will be used to help the team focus solely on developing Zuggol over the summer.  We plan to iron out all the kinks we have in our prototype with lines and lines and lines and lines of code that we will write over the summer to ensure we have an application that is secure and beautiful as we envision it.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has many valuable benefits for contributors and future users of the application.  We offer many unique rewards for contributions such as access to our beta plus 10 invites for your closest friends, to a diner and night out with the founders of Zuggol.  Although those rewards are awesome and all, the best part about any contribution that is $35 or more we will plant a tree in your honor, and that tree can forever be tracked in a virtual forest that will be set up with the help of The Carbon Farmer Inc.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to the zuggol project there is still many ways you can help.  Just by spreading the word of our application to friends, family, and co-workers would be a huge help.  Also sign up for our e-mail list so you can get important updates on the completion of the zuggol project and if you like flash mobs also sign up for our e-mail list because we plan to have something in the near future to help promote the application =). </p>

<h1 style=""margin-left: 240px;""><strong>MobileMount</strong></h1>
<p>The MobileMount is a universal mount/kickstand for virtually any hand held device with a hard flat surface, like smartphones and tablets. Comprised of two twist-to-lock suction cups and one ball joint, this device's unique design allows for superior suction and durability. The Twist-to-Lock suction cups can hold devices for weeks at a time rather than simply a few hours like other competing mounts.  Additionally, the <strong>""Patent Pending"" </strong>universal design allows for users to mount their a variety of devices, not just smartphones.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1065.photobucket.com/albums/u398/jandmcompany/c950a416.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1 style=""margin-left: 150px;""><strong> Twist-to-Lock Suction Cups</strong></h1>
<p>The two Twist-to-Lock suction cups are what make the MobileMount unique. The suction cups squeeze out the majority of the air when they are in the locked position. This creates a very strong vacuum between the suction cup and the device being mounted.  Due to the Twist-to-Lock suction cups, the MobileMount is more reliable when compared to other double suction cup mounts.  </p>

<h1 style=""margin-left: 240px;""><strong>Ball &amp; Joint</strong></h1>
<p>The ball and joint allow for free horizontal and vertical rotation, which allows you to angle your device according to your needs. This makes the MobileMount great for driving when you're using a GPS or hands-free calling.</p>

<h3><strong>ECLIPSE</strong></h3>

With the Eclipse, women no longer have to rely on only their hands and the annual mammogram. </p>
<p><strong>We are creating a palm-sized home scanning device</strong> that creates a digital map of a woman’s breast with GPS-like precision. The Eclipse allows women to “see” what can’t be felt in a traditional monthly breast self-exam. Images are uploaded so changes can be monitored.  If denser masses appear vividly on a computer or tablet screen, it will prompt users to seek a comprehensive diagnosis from a medical professional.  As we all know – early detection in changes is key to saving lives.</p>
<p><strong>The Eclipse device uses a 100% safe cross physics combination of sensors</strong> and low level photons (LED lights) to gather images and acquire data.  It’s as simple to use as a digital camera and uploads just as easily.  Simply move the Eclipse device over the entire area of each breast, and the images will automatically connect to make one large image of the entire breast that can be saved for reference.  The only energy used in gathering these images is a harmless low-power LED light that measures micro-pressure points onto a soft sensor pad. It’s like having your hand become a digital camera that takes a picture of the pressure point as you scan the breast.</p>

<h3><strong>ECLIPSE IS SAFE</strong></h3>
<p>The Eclipse combines patent-pending imaging and sensor technology into a simple and safe system that allows women to easily monitor their breast health.</p>
<p>The Eclipse uses no radiation or invasive technology, so women are able to use the Eclipse as often as they like without any risk of side effects. Scans are administered by applying moderate pressure while sliding the device in an overlapping pattern across the breast to produce a series of high-resolution deep-tissue images.</p>
<p>Images are created with TransPhotonic technology, a one hundred percent safe cross-physics combination of sensors and low-level photons that closely mimic the human touch. The sensors, however, are up to 5 times more sensitive than fingers, enabling the Eclipse to discover and capture images of small masses that could otherwise go undetected in a traditional manual self-exam. TransPhotonic technology was originally co-engineered by our founder, Ken Wright, for U.S. Navy submarines to “see” in murky-water and other obstructed situations.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>

<h3><strong>ECLIPSE IS SMART</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Within the Eclipse software, a series of images are precisely aligned using a GPS-like function to create a complete picture of the breast. Deep tissue masses are highlighted in the image, which can then be saved and monitored for changes as part of your monthly self-breast exam, or shared with a medical professional, or the Eclipse Image Review Service.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/10264/files/20130813143418-eclipse8.jpg?1376429658"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>ECLIPSE'S PINK CLOUD ECOSYSTEM</strong></h3>
<p>The Pink Cloud is a networked breast health social ecosystem of Eclipse users. When a woman activates her Eclipse device, she automatically receives a Pink Cloud account. This turnkey service is as easy to use as iTunes and streamlines a woman’s ability to monitor her breast health. Images generated using the Eclipse are automatically uploaded to her personal, private account. Depending upon her preference, each woman may choose to keep her images private, share them with her doctor, use Eclipse’s review service or anonymously share them with other members of the Pink Cloud community.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>ECLIPSE IS PRIVATE AND SECURE</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike traditional social media sites, the Pink Cloud is a safe, anonymous, member-only community.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/10267/files/20130813143519-eclipse9.jpg?1376429719"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>ECLIPSE IS EMPOWERING</strong></h3>
<p>The Pink Cloud brings together the combined wisdom, strength, and compassion of women who have taken control of their breast health. Once logged in, women can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access a secure area to upload and store scans directly from Eclipse.  Once uploaded, they can monitor their breast health on a regular basis, share their scans with their doctor or subscribe to an image-review service in which medical experts provide analysis of their scans.</li>
<li>Schedule automatic email and text reminders about self-exams.</li>
<li>Provide their insights, ideas and opinions as part of a community to help us improve Eclipse and the Pink Cloud as we develop new features and services focused on early detection.</li>
<li>Join our social network where they can share advice on how to better use the Eclipse, promote good breast-health practices and inspire other women to be proactive about their breast health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the Pink Cloud Community, each user has an opportunity to ask and answer questions, seek and offer advice, solicit and provide counsel, and exchange referrals. In addition, the Pink Cloud hosts message boards, provides breast health information, and access to doctors.</p>
<p>Our aim is to make the Pink Cloud the destination site for breast health. Together, Eclipse and the Pink Cloud will become the forefront of early breast cancer detection.</p>

<h3><strong>ECLIPSE INVENTOR AND VISIONARY</strong></h3>
<p>Ken Wright is an accomplished inventor and visionary with a true passion for product development and industrial design.</p>
<p>With breast cancer awareness on the rise - and yet few innovative solutions on the horizon - Ken was inspired as a husband and father to utilize his skills as an innovator to make a better future for his wife and daughter, and generations of women ahead.</p>
<p>Ken has invented and contributed to award-winning product designs in industries ranging from automotive to aerospace, to telecommunications and healthcare. He also co-engineered an underwater laser scanning system for autonomous deep-sea exploration submarines which inspired Eclipse technology.</p>
<p>Ken also helped develop the first portable zinc-air fuel cell, the first full-motion teleconferencing system, and the first mobile satellite news vehicles. His “Edison” approach to code breaking and problem solving has made him an invaluable resource to such companies as Canon, AquaLung and NiteRider Technical Lighting Systems, LucasFilm, Paramount Pictures, Ford Motor Company and Disney.</p>
<p>Ken Wright: “Of all the projects I have ever worked on, Eclipse has the most meaning and value to me by far. The wonderful support we have gotten and continue to get will mean we can get this life-saving technology into women’s hands sooner than later. The Eclipse needs to exist now!”</p>

<h3><strong>THE ECLIPSE STORY</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>What Inspired The Idea? Eclipse?</strong></h4>
<p>Ken Wright, the inventor of Eclipse, was involved in developing highly advanced sensor technology that allowed autonomous submarines to see through murky water. Not only could the sensors see through these obstructed situations, they could also discriminate between different materials and molecular properties of target objects on the ocean floor.  That led to the big eureka moment when Mr. Wright realized he could modify this type of technology using harmless low level light (Photons) to look into the body, and in particular, the breast, to find specific cell targets and diseases like cancer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/10285/files/20130813144333-eclipse12.jpg?1376430213"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>The Eclipse Discovery</strong></h4>
<p>Soon after his eureka moment, Ken Wright got to work. Over the next decade and a half - through countless hours of R&amp;D, proof of concept models and prototype efforts - Ken was able to put this life saving technology into the size of a computer mouse for the price of a low cost digital camera or phone.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Eclipse Prototypes</strong></h4>
<p>Over 100 prototypes, proof of concept and experimental models have been iteratively developed to help us get to where we are today.</p>
<h4><strong>Eclipse Testing </strong></h4>
<p>We have done extensive in-house alpha and beta testing at our Innovation Labs in San Diego, as well as collaborative testing and research with several major medical universities and cancer specialists.</p>
<h4><strong>Your Feedback </strong></h4>
<p>We are now ready to put Eclipse into the hands of at least a thousand women to fully beta test the ergonomics and Pink Cloud experience using the Eclipse PS1 pilot program.</p>
<h4><strong>The Future</strong></h4>
<p>We are trying to break new ground and develop something that is undeniably needed: taking the guess-work out of self-breast exams with a simple and smart digital breast self-exam device. Like the now commonplace home digital scale, thermometer or blood pressure device, Eclipse delivers precise information that puts women in control of their health.</p>
<h4><strong>Where we are in development</strong></h4>
<p>Thanks to fully functioning prototypes and extensive testing, we are ready for our first beta pilot product, Eclipse PS1, to be manufactured in a limited production. A manufacturing plant in the US has been identified, and as soon as the funding is available, production can begin. A prototype of the Pink Cloud has also been in development and tested in preparation for the beta-tester community.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Mission and Goal</strong></h4>
<p>Our mission is to empower women with the Eclipse digital breast self-exam system. Our goal is to put working prototypes into the hands of 1000 women by the first quarter of 2014 to gain critical feedback to have the Eclipse prepared for full production by the fourth quarter of 2014. Our goal is to have over a million Eclipses in the hands of women by the end of 2015, and more than 20 million within fiver years. We will also create and distribute over 1000 community kits to developing countries by the end of 2015, and 100,000 kits within five years.</p>
<p>Eclipse technology will also be made available to the medical community with the goal of radically improving current mammography systems, as well as empowering women and their doctors to work together to deliver the most comprehensive breast health.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT </strong></h3>
<p>Help us make history for women everywhere by providing an effective means of early detection that leads to early treatment in the fight against breast cancer.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help. The Eclipse PS1 (Phase1) system is a non-medical, beta model device. We want to put the Eclipse PS1 technology into the hands of women and medical professionals as soon as possible to gather critical feedback.</p>
<p>We’re looking to raise $650,000 to finish the funding needed to get the Eclipse to market.</p>

<h4><strong>What is the Eclipse PS1 Beta</strong></h4>
<p>The Eclipse PS-1 is a beta model/system used for evaluation and feedback from women and medical professionals It's purpose is to get our technology into the hands of 1,000 women and medical professionals for important feedback that will ultimately help our final product. This will help the company grow its user experience smartly.</p>
<p>Getting early adopters in at this level has a huge win-win effect for both Eclipse and the women it will help. The whole purpose is to test and develop Eclipse iteratively until it is the best it can be.</p>
<p>The Eclipse PS-1 program is designed to take participants through a journey of learning and discovery about breast health. It is designed for both learning and input as the process moves forward. The Eclipse experience will guide participants through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational breast health subjects</li>
<li>Techniques</li>
<li>Trials</li>
<li>Interactions with the Eclipse engineering and medical professional team</li>
<li>Help determine the final commercial Eclipse PS-2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Eclipse 1 device is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. The FDA has not yet evaluated the Eclipse PS1 device, technology, services or statements. The Eclipse PS1 device is a pre-production model intended to be used by our pilot program participants, for the use of simulation practice, education and testing. Since the Eclipse PS1 works off of very low-level light (photons), there is no invasive or harmful technology involved. Our goal is to create a device commercially available FDA approved device that will act as a prompting tool for the user to seek professional medical attention if changes in the breast are seen and/or detected, and empower women to better monitor their breast health.</p>

Every dollar you pledge for the Eclipse Breast Health campaign will be used to move our working prototypes into beta production units that will go into the hands of 1,000-10,000 women by the beginning of 2014. These units will help us acquire critical user feedback to improve the Eclipse and drive its full production at the end of 2014. Be a hero to women everywhere and help us make early detection easier.
Your contribution will go directly to our cause - early detection - and making Eclipse a must have for women everywhere!
Do this for the women in your life. Right now we have incredible working prototypes, but we need your help in taking them to the next level, and letting Eclipse overshadow breast cancer.

 
ECLIPSE
We all know early detection is critical in the fight against breast cancer. However, monthly self-breast exams have left women in doubt – “Am I doing it right? How can I really tell if this is a change from last month? When should I see my doctor?""  Our mission is to empower women with the life-saving knowledge of early detection. With the Eclipse, women no longer have to rely on only their hands and the annual mammogram. 
We are creating a palm-sized home scanning device that creates a digital map of a woman’s breast with GPS-like precision. The Eclipse allows women to “see” what can’t be felt in a traditional monthly breast self-exam. Images are uploaded so changes can be monitored.  If denser masses appear vividly on a computer or tablet screen, it will prompt users to seek a comprehensive diagnosis from a medical professional.  As we all know – early detection in changes is key to saving lives.
The Eclipse device uses a 100% safe cross physics combination of sensors and low level photons (LED lights) to gather images and acquire data.  It’s as simple to use as a digital camera and uploads just as easily.  Simply move the Eclipse device over the entire area of each breast, and the images will automatically connect to make one large image of the entire breast that can be saved for reference.  The only energy used in gathering these images is a harmless low-power LED light that measures micro-pressure points onto a soft sensor pad. It’s like having your hand become a digital camera that takes a picture of the pressure point as you scan the breast.
 
ECLIPSE IS SIMPLE







ECLIPSE ENHANCES THE STANDARD BREAST SELF EXAM
1. The Eclipse self-exam is easy and best performed while lying down. Place a pillow behind your left shoulder and arm.



2. Hold Eclipse in your right hand. Press the device at varying pressures on your left breast. Move the device in a top-to-bottom motion to ensure you scan the entire breast. Once you finish on the left side, switch the pillow to under your right shoulder and repeat the procedure on your right breast.
 



Option: You also can use the optional Eclipse “grid shirt” that helps guide you through a complete exam.



3. After you’ve finished scanning, transfer the images to the Eclipse software or to your Pink Cloud account.  You can do this wirelessly or by connecting the Eclipse with the supplied USB cable. The Pink Cloud is our turnkey service that stores your images on our secure website and allows them to be reviewed by medical professionals.
  



ECLIPSE IS SAFE
The Eclipse combines patent-pending imaging and sensor technology into a simple and safe system that allows women to easily monitor their breast health.
The Eclipse uses no radiation or invasive technology, so women are able to use the Eclipse as often as they like without any risk of side effects. Scans are administered by applying moderate pressure while sliding the device in an overlapping pattern across the breast to produce a series of high-resolution deep-tissue images.
Images are created with TransPhotonic technology, a one hundred percent safe cross-physics combination of sensors and low-level photons that closely mimic the human touch. The sensors, however, are up to 5 times more sensitive than fingers, enabling the Eclipse to discover and capture images of small masses that could otherwise go undetected in a traditional manual self-exam. TransPhotonic technology was originally co-engineered by our founder, Ken Wright, for U.S. Navy submarines to “see” in murky-water and other obstructed situations.


ECLIPSE IS SMART

Within the Eclipse software, a series of images are precisely aligned using a GPS-like function to create a complete picture of the breast. Deep tissue masses are highlighted in the image, which can then be saved and monitored for changes as part of your monthly self-breast exam, or shared with a medical professional, or the Eclipse Image Review Service.
ECLIPSE'S PINK CLOUD ECOSYSTEM
The Pink Cloud is a networked breast health social ecosystem of Eclipse users. When a woman activates her Eclipse device, she automatically receives a Pink Cloud account. This turnkey service is as easy to use as iTunes and streamlines a woman’s ability to monitor her breast health. Images generated using the Eclipse are automatically uploaded to her personal, private account. Depending upon her preference, each woman may choose to keep her images private, share them with her doctor, use Eclipse’s review service or anonymously share them with other members of the Pink Cloud community.

ECLIPSE IS PRIVATE AND SECURE
Unlike traditional social media sites, the Pink Cloud is a safe, anonymous, member-only community.

 


ECLIPSE IS EMPOWERING
The Pink Cloud brings together the combined wisdom, strength, and compassion of women who have taken control of their breast health. Once logged in, women can:

Access a secure area to upload and store scans directly from Eclipse.  Once uploaded, they can monitor their breast health on a regular basis, share their scans with their doctor or subscribe to an image-review service in which medical experts provide analysis of their scans.
Schedule automatic email and text reminders about self-exams.
Provide their insights, ideas and opinions as part of a community to help us improve Eclipse and the Pink Cloud as we develop new features and services focused on early detection.
Join our social network where they can share advice on how to better use the Eclipse, promote good breast-health practices and inspire other women to be proactive about their breast health.

Within the Pink Cloud Community, each user has an opportunity to ask and answer questions, seek and offer advice, solicit and provide counsel, and exchange referrals. In addition, the Pink Cloud hosts message boards, provides breast health information, and access to doctors.
Our aim is to make the Pink Cloud the destination site for breast health. Together, Eclipse and the Pink Cloud will become the forefront of early breast cancer detection.




 

ECLIPSE INVENTOR AND VISIONARY
Ken Wright is an accomplished inventor and visionary with a true passion for product development and industrial design.
With breast cancer awareness on the rise - and yet few innovative solutions on the horizon - Ken was inspired as a husband and father to utilize his skills as an innovator to make a better future for his wife and daughter, and generations of women ahead.
Ken has invented and contributed to award-winning product designs in industries ranging from automotive to aerospace, to telecommunications and healthcare. He also co-engineered an underwater laser scanning system for autonomous deep-sea exploration submarines which inspired Eclipse technology.
Ken also helped develop the first portable zinc-air fuel cell, the first full-motion teleconferencing system, and the first mobile satellite news vehicles. His “Edison” approach to code breaking and problem solving has made him an invaluable resource to such companies as Canon, AquaLung and NiteRider Technical Lighting Systems, LucasFilm, Paramount Pictures, Ford Motor Company and Disney.
Ken Wright: “Of all the projects I have ever worked on, Eclipse has the most meaning and value to me by far. The wonderful support we have gotten and continue to get will mean we can get this life-saving technology into women’s hands sooner than later. The Eclipse needs to exist now!”


AN INSPIRED TEAM
The Eclipse team is a collaboration of intelligent and passionate technologists, scientists, doctors, breast health advocates, sponsors and associates that are determined to help ensure Eclipse becomes a reality for millions of women and loved ones.















THE ECLIPSE STORY
What Inspired The Idea? Eclipse?
Ken Wright, the inventor of Eclipse, was involved in developing highly advanced sensor technology that allowed autonomous submarines to see through murky water. Not only could the sensors see through these obstructed situations, they could also discriminate between different materials and molecular properties of target objects on the ocean floor.  That led to the big eureka moment when Mr. Wright realized he could modify this type of technology using harmless low level light (Photons) to look into the body, and in particular, the breast, to find specific cell targets and diseases like cancer.



The Eclipse Discovery
Soon after his eureka moment, Ken Wright got to work. Over the next decade and a half - through countless hours of R&D, proof of concept models and prototype efforts - Ken was able to put this life saving technology into the size of a computer mouse for the price of a low cost digital camera or phone.







Eclipse Prototypes
Over 100 prototypes, proof of concept and experimental models have been iteratively developed to help us get to where we are today.
Eclipse Testing 
We have done extensive in-house alpha and beta testing at our Innovation Labs in San Diego, as well as collaborative testing and research with several major medical universities and cancer specialists.
Your Feedback 
We are now ready to put Eclipse into the hands of at least a thousand women to fully beta test the ergonomics and Pink Cloud experience using the Eclipse PS1 pilot program.
The Future
We are trying to break new ground and develop something that is undeniably needed: taking the guess-work out of self-breast exams with a simple and smart digital breast self-exam device. Like the now commonplace home digital scale, thermometer or blood pressure device, Eclipse delivers precise information that puts women in control of their health.
Where we are in development
Thanks to fully functioning prototypes and extensive testing, we are ready for our first beta pilot product, Eclipse PS1, to be manufactured in a limited production. A manufacturing plant in the US has been identified, and as soon as the funding is available, production can begin. A prototype of the Pink Cloud has also been in development and tested in preparation for the beta-tester community.
Our Mission and Goal
Our mission is to empower women with the Eclipse digital breast self-exam system. Our goal is to put working prototypes into the hands of 1000 women by the first quarter of 2014 to gain critical feedback to have the Eclipse prepared for full production by the fourth quarter of 2014. Our goal is to have over a million Eclipses in the hands of women by the end of 2015, and more than 20 million within fiver years. We will also create and distribute over 1000 community kits to developing countries by the end of 2015, and 100,000 kits within five years.
Eclipse technology will also be made available to the medical community with the goal of radically improving current mammography systems, as well as empowering women and their doctors to work together to deliver the most comprehensive breast health.
 
WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT 
Help us make history for women everywhere by providing an effective means of early detection that leads to early treatment in the fight against breast cancer.
This is where we need your help. The Eclipse PS1 (Phase1) system is a non-medical, beta model device. We want to put the Eclipse PS1 technology into the hands of women and medical professionals as soon as possible to gather critical feedback.
We’re looking to raise $650,000 to finish the funding needed to get the Eclipse to market.

What You Get

 

What is the Eclipse PS1 Beta
The Eclipse PS-1 is a beta model/system used for evaluation and feedback from women and medical professionals It's purpose is to get our technology into the hands of 1,000 women and medical professionals for important feedback that will ultimately help our final product. This will help the company grow its user experience smartly.
Getting early adopters in at this level has a huge win-win effect for both Eclipse and the women it will help. The whole purpose is to test and develop Eclipse iteratively until it is the best it can be.
The Eclipse PS-1 program is designed to take participants through a journey of learning and discovery about breast health. It is designed for both learning and input as the process moves forward. The Eclipse experience will guide participants through:

Educational breast health subjects
Techniques
Trials
Interactions with the Eclipse engineering and medical professional team
Help determine the final commercial Eclipse PS-2

 
NOTE: The Eclipse 1 device is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. The FDA has not yet evaluated the Eclipse PS1 device, technology, services or statements. The Eclipse PS1 device is a pre-production model intended to be used by our pilot program participants, for the use of simulation practice, education and testing. Since the Eclipse PS1 works off of very low-level light (photons), there is no invasive or harmful technology involved. Our goal is to create a device commercially available FDA approved device that will act as a prompting tool for the user to seek professional medical attention if changes in the breast are seen and/or detected, and empower women to better monitor their breast health.





ECLIPSE - A GAME-CHANGER AND LIFE-SAVER
Brad Graves, Bob Baransko and Korey Castillo, San Diego Business Journal
“We have interviewed and have seen many impressive technologies and innovative companies in San Diego but after visiting the Eclipse labs and seeing the Eclipse demonstration we were truly amazed. This is a technology and product path that will literally change the breast health industry. A definite game changer and life-saver.”




Dr Han Chiu M.D., MA, Stanford School of Medicine
 “I believe this is a great advancement for breast cancer and perhaps beyond to other areas of the body,” said Dr. Han Chiu MD, Stanford School of Medicine.  “It’s as safe as using your own finger tips only much more sensitive and effective.  There hasn’t been anything like this for breast health which gives me as a physician quantifiable data to be more objective while also adding to better patient interaction.”




James H. Adair, Ph.D., Professor, Material Science and Engineering and Bioengineering, Penn State University - Keystone Nano, Inc
“Eclipse’s vision absolutely resonates with the vision we have at Penn State and Keystone Nano.
Eclipse and our technologies will empower women with more than just early detection, it means that the words, ""You have cancer.' will stop evoking the fear and desperation and lead to us treating cancer like just another treatable disease.  Early detection means far less invasive surgical options are possible.  Your early detection system resonates with me because we at Keystone Nano share your vision.
We share the same enthusiastic outlook for this technology and willingness to create solutions to transform this dreaded disease into a manageable illness.  My wife, Bernadette has battled breast cancer with 11 major surgeries; 4 rounds of chemo.
I am honored to work with the Eclipse team as part of our important mission.”

<p>Vaultek® is a smart safe designed to keep your belongings - yours. </p>
<p>Your things, the things you love.  Your life, your security.  Vaultek® is making personal security more accessible than ever - protecting what matters most.</p>

<p>The Vaultek™ app connects via Bluetooth to allowing you to remotely unlock the safe.  We have employed a sophisticated encryption algorithm to ensure the Bluetooth communication between your phone and the Vaultek™ safe are completely secure.    </p>
<h4><b>Fingerprint Scanner</b></h4>
<p>A high resolution fingerprint scanner grants quick access to the safe.  You can store up to 20 different user IDs.</p>
<h4><b>Backlit Keypad</b></h4>
<p>A backlit numeric keypad illuminates at night via proximity sensor providing visibility at night or in low light environments.</p>

</div>
<h4>Rugged Uni-Body</h4>
<div>The uni-body exterior is created from formed carbon steel; there are no welds for superior strength.</div>
<div>
<h4><b>Anti-Impact Latches</b></h4>
<p>Latches are impact resistant to withstand forceful impacts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Anti-Pry Bars</b></p>
<p>Reinforced anti-pry bars along the seams prevent tools from attempting to pry the safe open.</p>
<h4><b>Protected Hinges</b></h4>
<p>Hinges are mounted on the interior so they can not be breached.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 18px;"">Security Sleep Mode</b></p>
<p>Activates when six (6) consecutive incorrect keypad entries are made. During sleep mode the keypad does not accept any entries for two minutes. If a button is pressed during Sleep Mode, all of the numbers flash red and the alarm sounds twice. The backup key may be used to open the safe during sleep mode.</p>
<h4><b>Tamper Detection</b></h4>
<p>The Vaultek™ safe has a built in tamper detection feature that will let you know if someone has entered an incorrect code on the keypad. You will receive a notification on your phone when someone has entered an incorrect code on the keypad if in Bluetooth range.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Vaultek® integrates powerful technology to create a safe that's not only secure, but accessible and simple to use.  Its core features a 32-bit micro processor that creates a highly responsive experience.  Whether you are opening the safe with the app, numeric keypad, or the fingerprint scanner - feedback is quick and accurate.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h4><b>Securing your Biometric Identity</b></h4>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470963296/Gogo_Scanner_pndfyl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 399px;""/></p>
<p>Vaultek™ safes use a high resolution fingerprint scanner with a scanning area of 9mm x 9mm.  The safe does not keep any fingerprint images in its memory.  It only extracts and keeps digital templates consisting of minute information of the original print.  This information can not be used to reconstruct fingerprint images.  This results in safeguarding your identify while providing quick and accurate access.</p>
</div>
<h4><b>Stealth Mode</b></h4>
<p>You can toggle the sound On/Off; a feature that silences the polyphonic feedback.</p>
<div>
<h4><b>Interior Light</b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470961457/Illuminated_Interior_mkkcup.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With interior LEDs, you can see your belongings in dark environments, and using the Vaultek™ app you can control the brightness of the light.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;"">Automatic Hand Detection</span></h4>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470961489/Illuminated_Interface_fqxrj9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Speed is key to immediate access.  A proximity sensor automatically detects your hand presence and readies the safe for input commands.  This is especially helpful at night or in dimly lit environments, allowing the interface to illuminate for visibility.</p>
<h4><b>Travel Mode</b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When transporting your safe, you may wish to put your safe into travel mode in order to save power. </p>
</div>
<div><p><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;text-align: center;"">Portable Power</span></p></div>
<div><div>
<p>Under normal usage the battery can last up to 4 months.  When ready to recharge, an included micro-USB cable plugs into the safe sidewall.</p>

</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Vaultek® is the result of more than two years non-stop hard work by a team of designers, engineers, testers and advisors. Our goal has always been to come up with the best personal safe that incorporates advanced technology, elegant styling, solid construction, and excellent workmanship.  We started from rough concepts with wild ideas two years ago, and now we have completed the production tooling and </span><u style=""font-weight: normal;"">stage one</u><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> engineering tests. We have created (6) functional units using production tooling, and very pleased with the results: the safe looks beautiful, feels great, and performs reliably.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The keypad construction is similar to professional gaming keyboards; powered by a fast micro processor.  The safe can be accessed quickly and reliably through the keypad, a high resolution fingerprint scanner, or the Vaultek® smartphone app. The safe contains many features that have not been seen before in this industry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our team is very proud of what we have achieved thus far, and we will continue our progress by receiving feedback and testing functional units to identify all problems and glitches - revising and refining before moving into mass production. We invite you to become a Vaultek® Beta Pilot tester and give us your feedback.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">By supporting the Vaultek® community as a backer, you help us transition from testing stage to the first mass production scheduled to start late September this year. Your contribution completes this last leg of our long journey.  Many thanks from the Vaultek® team! </span></p>

Simple Smart Security
 
 

Vaultek® is a smart safe designed to keep your belongings - yours. 
Your things, the things you love.  Your life, your security.  Vaultek® is making personal security more accessible than ever - protecting what matters most.
Secure Access
How to open your Vaultek® safe.

 
 
 
 Vaultek™ Smart App 
The Vaultek™ app connects via Bluetooth to allowing you to remotely unlock the safe.  We have employed a sophisticated encryption algorithm to ensure the Bluetooth communication between your phone and the Vaultek™ safe are completely secure.    
Fingerprint Scanner
A high resolution fingerprint scanner grants quick access to the safe.  You can store up to 20 different user IDs.
Backlit Keypad
A backlit numeric keypad illuminates at night via proximity sensor providing visibility at night or in low light environments.

 
Secure Defense
How your Vaultek® safe keeps people out.

 
 

 
 


Rugged Uni-Body
The uni-body exterior is created from formed carbon steel; there are no welds for superior strength.

Anti-Impact Latches
Latches are impact resistant to withstand forceful impacts.
 
Anti-Pry Bars
Reinforced anti-pry bars along the seams prevent tools from attempting to pry the safe open.
Protected Hinges
Hinges are mounted on the interior so they can not be breached.


 
Security Sleep Mode
Activates when six (6) consecutive incorrect keypad entries are made. During sleep mode the keypad does not accept any entries for two minutes. If a button is pressed during Sleep Mode, all of the numbers flash red and the alarm sounds twice. The backup key may be used to open the safe during sleep mode.
Tamper Detection
The Vaultek™ safe has a built in tamper detection feature that will let you know if someone has entered an incorrect code on the keypad. You will receive a notification on your phone when someone has entered an incorrect code on the keypad if in Bluetooth range.

 
 
Vaultek® VT20i Safe
 

Vaultek® integrates powerful technology to create a safe that's not only secure, but accessible and simple to use.  Its core features a 32-bit micro processor that creates a highly responsive experience.  Whether you are opening the safe with the app, numeric keypad, or the fingerprint scanner - feedback is quick and accurate.

Securing your Biometric Identity

 

Vaultek™ safes use a high resolution fingerprint scanner with a scanning area of 9mm x 9mm.  The safe does not keep any fingerprint images in its memory.  It only extracts and keeps digital templates consisting of minute information of the original print.  This information can not be used to reconstruct fingerprint images.  This results in safeguarding your identify while providing quick and accurate access.

Stealth Mode
You can toggle the sound On/Off; a feature that silences the polyphonic feedback.

Interior Light
 

 
With interior LEDs, you can see your belongings in dark environments, and using the Vaultek™ app you can control the brightness of the light.
Automatic Hand Detection
 

Speed is key to immediate access.  A proximity sensor automatically detects your hand presence and readies the safe for input commands.  This is especially helpful at night or in dimly lit environments, allowing the interface to illuminate for visibility.
Travel Mode
 
 
When transporting your safe, you may wish to put your safe into travel mode in order to save power. 

Portable Power

Under normal usage the battery can last up to 4 months.  When ready to recharge, an included micro-USB cable plugs into the safe sidewall.
 


Introducing the Vaultek® App
 
The Vaultek™ app is available for Android and iOS devices. 

 

 
The app brings in a new level of interaction between you and the safe.  You can perform multiple tasks, including unlocking the safe with one simple swipe.
App Features:

1. Monitor battery level: Opt to receive notifications of low battery.

2. Remotely unlock safe: While in Bluetooth range you can remotely open the safe with the Vaultek™ app.

3. Adjust the brightness of the interior light: You can vary the brightness on the internal light of the safe from 0 – 100%.

4. Option to disable sound: Can turn the successful unlock sound, and the number keypad sound On/Off. 

5. Manage multiple user accounts: With the app you can delete User Ids from the safe or assign a name to any User ID. Set Password and manage multiple user accounts. 

6. Track usage history of safe access
 
 



Perk Rewards
Due to several requests since start of campaign to offer a non fingerprint model, our team moved quickly to develop a solution.  Introducing the VT20, all the same features of the VT20i, but without the fingerprint scanner for an improved price point.

Where we are now:

 
Vaultek® is the result of more than two years non-stop hard work by a team of designers, engineers, testers and advisors. Our goal has always been to come up with the best personal safe that incorporates advanced technology, elegant styling, solid construction, and excellent workmanship.  We started from rough concepts with wild ideas two years ago, and now we have completed the production tooling and stage one engineering tests. We have created (6) functional units using production tooling, and very pleased with the results: the safe looks beautiful, feels great, and performs reliably.
The keypad construction is similar to professional gaming keyboards; powered by a fast micro processor.  The safe can be accessed quickly and reliably through the keypad, a high resolution fingerprint scanner, or the Vaultek® smartphone app. The safe contains many features that have not been seen before in this industry.
Our team is very proud of what we have achieved thus far, and we will continue our progress by receiving feedback and testing functional units to identify all problems and glitches - revising and refining before moving into mass production. We invite you to become a Vaultek® Beta Pilot tester and give us your feedback.  
By supporting the Vaultek® community as a backer, you help us transition from testing stage to the first mass production scheduled to start late September this year. Your contribution completes this last leg of our long journey.  Many thanks from the Vaultek® team!

<p><b>CUSTOM-ENGINEERED BATTERY<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In the design process, Renogy has spared no expense to
engineer a superior lithium-iron-phosphate battery (a higher grade than the
ones found in Tesla vehicles) that outlasts others. For Lycan solar storage users,
this means you get more cycles in the life of your battery—approximately 2000
cycles or more on average—and it’s able to hold a charge longer than
traditional deep cycle batteries. Unlike standard batteries, you can keep The
Lycan powered for longer periods of time with no risk of battery depletion. Our
worry-free battery means you don’t have to make sure it’s fully charged every
three months—so your Lycan is truly a solar storage solution you can always count on. </span></p>

<p>The Lycan’s interchangeable battery is another thing that
makes this portable solar storage solution so exceptional—a feature we knew
would be integral in giving the user a truly unlimited power source. As the
very first compact solar storage product to include an interchangeable battery,
The Lycan allows you to prepare a library of fully charged batteries for quick,
hassle-free reloads and a truly sustainable energy solution. Now there’s no
waiting hours to recharge the unit, and when the battery runs through its life
cycle, you don’t have to run out and buy a whole new generator! This feature is
not only super convenient and energy efficient, it could potentially be a
lifesaver in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency. </p>

<p><b><i>R&amp;D /
Initial Design </i></b><br/>
<i>After the idea of a powerful but easy to use portable solar storage solution,
our engineering team quickly got to work with initial green-focused designs and
prototypes. The goal was to create a safe, sustainable product that maximized
performance and minimized the space. Given that there would be a lot of
components in a portable box, the engineering team also anticipated a lot of
heat generation. Therefore, initial designs catered to proper and natural heat
dissipation. Keeping safety as a priority, the engineering team researched and
decided on an initial design for the battery component. Once the initial design
was given the green light, the first shell was Rapid Prototyped to ensure form
and portability at full scale. Following the shell, the engineering team worked
endlessly to place the components in a fashion that geared the highest
performance, optimal efficiency, and maximum utility.  </i><br/>
<br/>
<b><i>Post Design / Improvements / Accomplishments <br/></i></b><i>In order to execute a product while keeping in mind the end goal, improvements
needed to be made. For starters, the engineering team was able to reduce the
size of the initial prototype, while maintaining the same peak performance. The
internal components were redesigned to optimize the space and air flow. In
order to increase internal air circulation, the Lycan was installed with
ultra-quiet fans and had more vents put into play in order to maximize heat
dissipation. The initial battery design came into question and upon further
review, we decided to go for the safest and most long-lasting battery
chemistries in the market today, lithium-iron-phosphate. Along with that, our
proprietary battery and connectors were designed to allow for quick and easy
replacing or swapping of the battery. This will eventually be a practice that
every consumer could do in under 20 seconds, if needed. These are the
improvements that have been accomplished thus far. <br/>
<br/>
<b>What still needs to be done?<br/></b></i><i>The Lycan design needs to undergo more safety and performance
tests for viability purposes. The LCD display is scheduled to be tooled out and
programmed to display parameters such as voltage values, amperage values, and
even state of charge (SOC) values for the different components both DC and AC.
Lastly, the battery needs to undergo a final test and approval upon mass
production. Once an overall design is finalized, the production mold will be
created and scheduled to meet mass production requirements. </i></p>

CUSTOM-ENGINEERED BATTERYIn the design process, Renogy has spared no expense to
engineer a superior lithium-iron-phosphate battery (a higher grade than the
ones found in Tesla vehicles) that outlasts others. For Lycan solar storage users,
this means you get more cycles in the life of your battery—approximately 2000
cycles or more on average—and it’s able to hold a charge longer than
traditional deep cycle batteries. Unlike standard batteries, you can keep The
Lycan powered for longer periods of time with no risk of battery depletion. Our
worry-free battery means you don’t have to make sure it’s fully charged every
three months—so your Lycan is truly a solar storage solution you can always count on. 


Custom Interchangeable Lithium-Iron-Phosphate Battery



The Lycan’s interchangeable battery is another thing that
makes this portable solar storage solution so exceptional—a feature we knew
would be integral in giving the user a truly unlimited power source. As the
very first compact solar storage product to include an interchangeable battery,
The Lycan allows you to prepare a library of fully charged batteries for quick,
hassle-free reloads and a truly sustainable energy solution. Now there’s no
waiting hours to recharge the unit, and when the battery runs through its life
cycle, you don’t have to run out and buy a whole new generator! This feature is
not only super convenient and energy efficient, it could potentially be a
lifesaver in the event of a natural disaster or other emergency.

means The Lycan delivers all the power we say it will, so you can count on it
to come through in any situation. With traditional deep cycle batteries, you
are generally only able to use 50% of the claimed amp hours. This precaution is
used by other portable chargers typically to preserve the life of their
batteries. However, The Lycan’s green-designed battery gives you up to 10x the battery life compared to standard deep cycle batteries. The
exceptional quality of our lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, plus strict
quality testing, ensures consistent charges that won’t deplete battery life as
quickly as with other batteries—a feature that means our solar storage solution
is always here for you. Simply put, The Lycan’s battery performs better and
lasts longer**—an advantage that keeps you and your family perfectly prepared

R&D /
Initial Design 
After the idea of a powerful but easy to use portable solar storage solution,
our engineering team quickly got to work with initial green-focused designs and
prototypes. The goal was to create a safe, sustainable product that maximized
performance and minimized the space. Given that there would be a lot of
components in a portable box, the engineering team also anticipated a lot of
heat generation. Therefore, initial designs catered to proper and natural heat
dissipation. Keeping safety as a priority, the engineering team researched and
decided on an initial design for the battery component. Once the initial design
was given the green light, the first shell was Rapid Prototyped to ensure form
and portability at full scale. Following the shell, the engineering team worked
endlessly to place the components in a fashion that geared the highest
performance, optimal efficiency, and maximum utility.  

Post Design / Improvements / Accomplishments In order to execute a product while keeping in mind the end goal, improvements
needed to be made. For starters, the engineering team was able to reduce the
size of the initial prototype, while maintaining the same peak performance. The
internal components were redesigned to optimize the space and air flow. In
order to increase internal air circulation, the Lycan was installed with
ultra-quiet fans and had more vents put into play in order to maximize heat
dissipation. The initial battery design came into question and upon further
review, we decided to go for the safest and most long-lasting battery
chemistries in the market today, lithium-iron-phosphate. Along with that, our
proprietary battery and connectors were designed to allow for quick and easy
replacing or swapping of the battery. This will eventually be a practice that
every consumer could do in under 20 seconds, if needed. These are the
improvements that have been accomplished thus far. 

What still needs to be done?The Lycan design needs to undergo more safety and performance
tests for viability purposes. The LCD display is scheduled to be tooled out and
programmed to display parameters such as voltage values, amperage values, and
even state of charge (SOC) values for the different components both DC and AC.
Lastly, the battery needs to undergo a final test and approval upon mass
production. Once an overall design is finalized, the production mold will be
created and scheduled to meet mass production requirements. 

We've come a long way and we are almost there. Check out a few of our early prototypes.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>Q) Can I charge 2 or more devices at the same time? </strong>Yes.You can charge simultaneously 2 or more devices. You can charge 2 mobile phones + a tablet + a laptop +.... As long as there are remaining out ports.</p>
<p><strong>Q) How does the GoldEye recharge?</strong>   The GoldEye can be recharged  1. Through an A/C wall plug,  2. through a car's lighter out or 3. by the sun. It will recharge even when ''off'' and left in the sun on your window sill. Think of the GoldEye as a rechargeable battery...whose role is to recharge the batteries of other devices.</p>
<p><strong>Q) How long does GoldEye's saved energy last?</strong> Like an battery, it will stay full until you start using it. We recommend recharging it once every 6 months to ensure it remains full when you need it.              </p>
<p><strong>Q) How long does it take to recharge my GoldEye Bar to 100%?</strong> The A/C wall recharge time is 3 hours. Recharging from the Sun alone takes 2 days.</p>
<p><strong>Q) Can I plug my devices to GoldEye while it is recharging itself from the sun?</strong> Yes. GoldEye can simultaneously charge your devices while recharging itself from the sun! You can leave your appliances attached (connected by cable) to the GoldEye Bar and the sun will continue to fill it up. Of course, the sun-recharge process is much slower than the A/C recharge method and does not imply the sun's energy is directly filling your device. It will most probably also use part of the saved energy supply.</p>
<p><strong>Q) How do I use GoldEye?</strong> Turn GoldEye on. Connect your device to  the 5V USB ports  (for mobiles) OR  to the Quick Out Notch port. The USB port supports maximum 5 volts; the 'Quick Out Notch' port supports 12,  16 and 19 Volts</p>
<p><strong>Q) Can I use the 2 USB  port to charge cameras or laptops?</strong> No. You use 'Quick Out Notch' to charge large devices like cameras and laptops since this is where the 12v-16v-19v charge comes out!   The 2 USB ports is 5V for smallest devices like mobiles phones.               </p>
<p><strong>Q) What's the difference between the Out Notch &amp; the USB ports please!?</strong>   Both accept USB connector cables but the Out notch also accepts barrel tip connector.  Out Notch gives higher voltage to charge large devices like laptops and the 2 USB ports are for small devices like mobile phones.   Not all USB cables can handle the same currents so the USB adaptor tip is made to transfer higher voltage current!</p>
<p><strong>Q)</strong> <strong>What If I plug my phone to the wrong port, it will take too much voltage and damage? </strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, If your mobile is compatible with Quick Charge technology then GoldEye Bar will fast charge it through the Out Notch port. Some recent Mobiles take fast charge, some don't. Check your phone's capability and plug it in the Safe USB ports if it takes lower voltage.</p>
<p><strong>Q) Where do I find cables that correspond with my device(s) if they are not included in the GoldEye package?</strong> The package includes 2 sets of cables: it's all you need.  You can find a wide range of USB cables online that fit your your devices. USB is the most common and adaptable cable tip out there. Some companies offer safe Magsafe-to-USB for example. Many DSLR battery chargers come with USB. A simple online search will give you affordable, safe and versatile range of cables for you. Or, Just ask us, we might be able to hand you some (cables or advice)!</p>
<p><strong>Q) I am so confused! which voltage do I choose for my device?</strong> GoldEye's Out Notch voltage settings are 12v, 16v, 19v. Check the specifications (voltage, amps, watts) that are written on the device or on the battery of the device you want to charge. Find specifications online or call the manufacturer! </p>
<p>To simplify things, think of the GoldEye as a battery that charges the battery of your other devices. Don't be intimidated by the size or cost of your device as the important component is the battery of your device.</p>
<p><strong>Q) But, the voltage of my device does not match exactly 12v/16v/19v, can I still use GoldEye?  </strong></p>
<p>As guidance, follow one basic simple rule: always choose the higher voltage +- 5V and never the lower one. For example, if your appliance requires 14.2 volts, then we recommend you choose setting 16V on the GoldEye and NOT 12v!  We recommend asking your device's manufacturer which of the three 12-16-19v setting is the best to recharge your device. The majority of devices are in that range.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">                 i. e  John Andersson (11.5).</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My name is Stanley Wissmar and I have a background
within Nanotechnology. We have developed a patented concept named ""SMARTRing"" which can be
used for a wide variety of applications. Technology has now progressed so far
that it is ready to adapt to us consumers fully on our terms. There is no need
to carry pass cards or keys etc. which can easily be misplaced or stolen. Now
it can all be stored in an ordinary fingering. With the latest generation of
Smartphones enabled with NFC (Near Field Communication, similar to RFID) you
can program pass cards and tags for your own individual needs. The silver based SMARTRing is
packaged with two NFC tags, one on the front side and the other on the backside,
in order to use it for several, different applications. The plastic part has an excellent (scratch resistant) surface which makes it impossible to see the difference from silver. It is commonly used for the medical industry (hearing aids etc.) so hence no allergic problems will become an issue.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The applications are
many, for example:</span><br/></p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>vCard (digital business
card)</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Home/Office: authentication
instead of a pass card to your digital door lock at home or at work.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Screenlock on
Smartphone: unlock screenlock on your Smartphone easily, to protect others than
yourself access your personal information.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Facebook:
authenticate easily every time you want to log in</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Paypal: Purchase
online even more secure than today by having an extra secret password stored in
your ring.</p>
<p>- Bitcoin: authenticate/purchase bitcoin currency securely.<br/></p>
<p>This is a small
excerpt. See also on Google Play all the Apps that are already available for
Smartphones with NFC capability.</p>
<p>We are now
finished with the development and prototyping and are now ready to launch
production where you can be one of the first, proud owners of this
revolutionary product.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>We need 30 000 USD in order to launch our first
production line. In detail it consists of manufacturing the electronics,
materials and mounting.  </p>
<p><b>What You get</b></p>
<p><b>The Product:</b> Our first product line will
be a classical design: an ordinary 6mm wide silvering which can be worn by both
male and females. The inside is made of pure silver and the outside of a
plastic with an excellent silver finish. The plastic is needed in order for the
NFC tag antenna to communicate with the Smartphone or Reader. So both in looks
and shape it is reminiscent of an ordinary ditto (see picture above).</p>
<p>Our unique perk is that by funding this project you
will get at the price of:</p>
<p>249USD - Your own SMARTRing</p>
<p>269 USD - Your
own SMARTRing with engravement (initials inside the ring)</p>

                 i. e  John Andersson (11.5).

My name is Stanley Wissmar and I have a background
within Nanotechnology. We have developed a patented concept named ""SMARTRing"" which can be
used for a wide variety of applications. Technology has now progressed so far
that it is ready to adapt to us consumers fully on our terms. There is no need
to carry pass cards or keys etc. which can easily be misplaced or stolen. Now
it can all be stored in an ordinary fingering. With the latest generation of
Smartphones enabled with NFC (Near Field Communication, similar to RFID) you
can program pass cards and tags for your own individual needs. The silver based SMARTRing is
packaged with two NFC tags, one on the front side and the other on the backside,
in order to use it for several, different applications. The plastic part has an excellent (scratch resistant) surface which makes it impossible to see the difference from silver. It is commonly used for the medical industry (hearing aids etc.) so hence no allergic problems will become an issue.
The applications are
many, for example:
- 
vCard (digital business
card)
- 
Home/Office: authentication
instead of a pass card to your digital door lock at home or at work.
- 
Screenlock on
Smartphone: unlock screenlock on your Smartphone easily, to protect others than
yourself access your personal information.
- 
Facebook:
authenticate easily every time you want to log in
- 
Paypal: Purchase
online even more secure than today by having an extra secret password stored in
your ring.
- Bitcoin: authenticate/purchase bitcoin currency securely.
This is a small
excerpt. See also on Google Play all the Apps that are already available for
Smartphones with NFC capability.
We are now
finished with the development and prototyping and are now ready to launch
production where you can be one of the first, proud owners of this
revolutionary product.
What We Need & What You Get
What we need
We need 30 000 USD in order to launch our first
production line. In detail it consists of manufacturing the electronics,
materials and mounting.  
What You get
The Product: Our first product line will
be a classical design: an ordinary 6mm wide silvering which can be worn by both
male and females. The inside is made of pure silver and the outside of a
plastic with an excellent silver finish. The plastic is needed in order for the
NFC tag antenna to communicate with the Smartphone or Reader. So both in looks
and shape it is reminiscent of an ordinary ditto (see picture above).
Our unique perk is that by funding this project you
will get at the price of:
249USD - Your own SMARTRing
269 USD - Your
own SMARTRing with engravement (initials inside the ring)
If we do not reach our goal we will use the funds to develop
and widen our product portfolio to offer a broader variety of rings having
- 
other material
combinations (gold, titanium, ceramics etc.)
- 
jewelry
ornaments and precious stones (diamonds, sapphire, zirconium etc.)
- 
custom designs,
where you can make your own design in collaboration with our design team.
Order Information
Every Ring
will be delivered in an exclusive gift box and sent with express delivery (DHL,
FedEx etc.). 
Ring Size: Measuring Your Finger
Your ring should fit your finger comfortably; snug
enough so that it will not fall off, but loose enough to slide over your
knuckle. Finger size changes depending on the time of day and the weather. For
best results measure your finger size:
At the end of the day and when your fingers are warm
(Fingers are smaller in the early morning and when cold.)
Measure finger size 3 to 4 times to eliminate an
erroneous reading.
Ring Sizes in US/Canada
Women’s rings typically range from size 3 to 9. The
most commonly purchased women’s ring sizes range from size 5 to 7. Size 6 is
the most common ring size.
Men’s rings typically range from size 8 to 14. The
most commonly purchased men’s ring sizes range from size 8 to 10-½. Size 9 is
the most popular ring size. 
International Size Conversion
If ordering from outside of the US or Canada,
determine your ring size according to your country’s standard. Then use the
International Ring Size Chart to convert to the corresponding US ring size to
place your order.

Not just a papercraft.We've all folded origami or built a paper model or two before, but up until now no one could program them or control the movement of their papercrafts from a mobile device. After months of development, we gave papercrafts the reboot they so direly needed. Kamibot is a programmable robot that you can skin and personalize with papercrafts.





Magnetic paper modules.Kamibot papercrafts are designed to be modular, with customizability in mind. Magnets are placed in paper modules as they are assembled so that you can share parts and accessories among all of your papercrafts.

   Control Kamibot's behavior from your smartphone.Kamibot can be controlled manually from your smartphone or tablet. When switched to line mode from your phone, it will follow a black line that it detects via infrared sensors located on its underside.
Kamibot can detect objects in front of itself.Not only can Kamibot measure how far an object is away from itself, but it can also avoid obstacles via ultrasound sensors installed at its front. Did we mention, Kamibot serves as a nice nightlight?





Even children can program Kamibot.Kamibot was designed to be an educational toy. Since it was built on the Arduino platform, it is compatible with Arduino and Scratch. This means anyone can reprogram Kamibot with the use of Scratch and Arduino. Note: We will provide the Kamibot libraries online on our website at no cost. 

Show us what you can make.You can print our templates off our website for free, so you can design your own unique Kamibot from home. Note: You should use magnets from our kits, unless your from the future and you printer can print magnets.  




You are playing a big role in the birth of Kamibot by supporting our campaign. KamiBot's design is finished and ready for manufacturing.All funds will go to manufacturing, production, and packaging of KamiBot e.g. materials, casting (tooling), printing/scoring of papercrafts, PCV production.  




We are confident and focused on delivering all pledges in a timely manner, However, as with any product that involves complex manufacturing, delays in production could possibly become an issue. We will be transparent with our backers, and keep our backers caught up on any issues we may have and mitigate such issues in a timely manner.

Our team is dedicated to bringing paper to life. Our vision is to expand the human imagination and creativity by bringing movement and animation to something as inanimate as paper. 




Q: What is ""papercrafting""?
A: Papercrafting is similar to origami (Japanese art of folding paper) except that the crafter cuts, folds, and glues pieces to create a final 3 dimensional object. In origami there is no such cutting or gluing involved. Note: Kamibot papercrafts come precut and scored

Q: How long is Kamibot's battery life?
A: Kamibot's battery lasts up to 90 minutes.

Q: How can I program Kamibot?
A: Kamibot can be programmed using an Arduino compatible IDE, such as Scratch. 

Q: What if I want to make my own papercraft?
A: Since we provide the templates online for free on our website, you can download a blank template and color and design your own unique character from your home.Q: What if my country isn't listed for shipping?A: If your country isn't list, it doesn't mean we can't ship there, just contact us via our landing page www.kamibot.com and we will figure out a way to ship out to you.

These can include:● Supply Chain: Manufacturing Delay A delay in the supply chain would cause us to miss our promised shipping deadlines. We don’t anticipate that this will become a problem, as we have developed really close relationships with our suppliers and have worked out a generous timeline that we intend to beat.● Fulfillment Capacity If we generate a lot of interest and we get swamped with orders, it is possible that fulfillment and shipping will be delayed. However, we have worked out a schedule for our project to ensure that we allow plenty of time to ship our orders in a timely fashion. We will be devoting our full-time efforts to this project.Above all, we want our potential backers to know that we plan to be very upfront and honest about any delays or challenges that we run into along the way.

<p>We at Lux Cables have spent our due diligence making a plan to provide our Lux cables to backers. Why do we need your donation?</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) to meet. If we receive $5,000 CAD in donations we will be able to make our creation a reality. </li>
<li>Quality is key - We need to meet this MOQ to make sure our product is created by the best manufacturer and so we don't lessen our quality like other cables out there. </li>
<li>MFI Certified - We will be using campaign funds for our MFI licensing, allowing us to use Apple certified connectors and the ""Made for iPod/iPad/iPhone Logo""</li>
</ul>

2 meters (just over 6 ft) in length while still providing the optimal amount of power being sent to your cable from any source. It is perfect for charging while reading or when you are too far away from a power outlet and double the length of most cables included with your devices!


Our lightning cable is MFI Certified (Apple certified) and manufactured by a licensed manufacturer, making sure that it compatible with any iOS and future iOS updates.


Metal encased tips and is covered by a thick nylon material (at least 25% thicker than most other cables), ensuring your cable is long lasting and tangle-free. No more dreaded splitting or bent ends.


Our Micro USB cables support Quick Charge and have a thicker wire gauge! Allowing you to use all of your phones charging features. (20AWG for lower resistance and faster charging than a budget cable). This allows you to charge your phone faster than conventional charging.


All of our cables include a one year warranty! Rest assured that you will have a premium cable with a guarantee.


We are always looking at additional ways to continually improve our cable as we grow! Your feedback is appreciated. Let us know if you have any ideas on how to improve our project and make our cable even more luxurious. 


Supports:

iPhone 5 / 5c / 5s / 6 / 6+ / 6s / 6s+
iPad mini / mini 2 / mini 3 / mini 4 / Air / Air 2 
iPad Pro

or
Android/Windows Phones and Tablets (our cable also supports Quick Charge)

Help us to bring our product from our mind to your home.
We at Lux Cables have spent our due diligence making a plan to provide our Lux cables to backers. Why do we need your donation?

We have a MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) to meet. If we receive $5,000 CAD in donations we will be able to make our creation a reality. 
Quality is key - We need to meet this MOQ to make sure our product is created by the best manufacturer and so we don't lessen our quality like other cables out there. 
MFI Certified - We will be using campaign funds for our MFI licensing, allowing us to use Apple certified connectors and the ""Made for iPod/iPad/iPhone Logo""



Send us a message at hello@luxcables.com or through Kickstarter and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
We welcome any feedback and further improvements recommended by our backers!


Help spread the word.
Make some noise about our campaign! Tell your friends and make sure to share our project. Your funds will be used towards accelerating production and making further improvements to our cable!
Thank you from all of us at Lux Cables.

The plans are new and improved to give us just what we need… at an excessive cost. The latest smartphone has the most “amazing” new features… but they aren’t innovative at all. NEBI.MOBI is the most cost-effective, innovative service and smartphone to ever hit the market. Cell phone providers think they have a lock on the services, but NEBI.MOBI, with your help, is going to show them how it’s really done.</p><p><b>As Seen On</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825465/files/20140831221508-yf-finance-us.gif?1409548508"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825471/files/20140831222446-investorwallstreetselect.gif?1409549086"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825460/files/20140831220047-informationweek.gif?1409547647"" href=""http://www.informationweek.com/prnewswire.asp?doc=201408280836PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH99750&amp;dir=0"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825474/files/20140831222636-investingbusinessweek.gif?1409549196"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825479/files/20140831222931-cbsmw.gif?1409549371"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825476/files/20140831222750-bjnewyork.gif?1409549270"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825477/files/20140831222833-klkntv.jpg?1409549313"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825482/files/20140831223144-cbsatlanta.gif?1409549504"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/825483/files/20140831223257-bjwashington.gif?1409549577"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>What Cellular Telephone Services Don’t Tell You—AKA The Deception</b></p><p>Telephone data is transformed from analog to digital content. All cell phone plans indicate a separation between talking minutes, number of text messages, and amount of data use. These are actually all the same service, provided the same way. By separating them and limiting amounts of each one for different packages, they deceive consumers into believing that different rates should apply to talk, text, and data. Why are we paying three different rates with different limitations for the same thing? All of these services are digitally provided. They should all be unlimited at one low price. This is a sales gimmick and it locks customers into two year contracts and fees for overages that are outrageous. </p><p><b>No More Hype, Just Honesty and Innovation</b></p><p>We need to move away from the hype and misleading information of cellular providers and their famous two year contracts and three prices for the same service. Instead of depending on cellular network signals, at NEBI.MOBI we are using Wi-Fi based network signals and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies to deliver superior service without the inflated price tag. These technologies are capable of supporting talk, text, and data – which is really all just data. This will bring smartphones to an entirely new level of capability and accessibility. That’s right, innovation in the mobile industry. This is a rare gem.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/803382/files/20140821132548-RetailTriangle.JPG?1408652748"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3></h3><p><b>Can I use VOIP?</b></p><p>VOIP technology has become increasingly efficient. Our codecs secure encrypted connections and maintain lightning-fast data transfer speed. Smartphone designs, whether you consider ours or your current phone, have advanced to the point of being able to support VOIP apps reliably.</p><p><b>Is Wi-Fi Up to the Challenge?</b></p><div>
<p>Wi-Fi is not controlled by government agencies and does not incur huge government-related fees and taxes. Wi-Fi signals have increased in capability and availability to a point that makes it faster and easier to access from a growing number of sources every day. We believe that free public Wi-Fi access should be available in every city. Free public access should be provided by each city’s leaders as a show of understanding of the importance of communication and connection in today’s world. One of our goals with funding of NEBI.MOBI is to increase advocacy nationwide for free public Wi-Fi in entire cities. Until we fully succeed, you can supplement your Wi-Fi access points through data-only cellular plans for achieving a wider coverage area, and still enjoy substantial savings compared to your traditional smartphone bills. You deserve to be able to connect wherever you are, without having to search for a free hotspot or pay a cellular service for data usage.</p>

<h3><b>Meet EVE 008—She’s Gorgeous and Highly Capable</b></h3>
<p>EVE 008 is our remarkable touchscreen smartphone. It actually has a replaceable battery that will eliminate the need for bulky charging cases or a tangle of charging cords and panicked searches for places to charge your phone. Two phone lines can be combined on one device by using two SIM card services simultaneously, eliminating the need for a work and home cell phone, lightening the load in your purse or pocket. An SD slot allows for expansion and transfer of data without dealing with additional technology or apps. Data is saved even if the phone is injured. And EVE 008 doesn’t carry the price tag of smartphones with even half of her capability. That doesn’t even begin to describe what EVE 008 can do for you.</p>

<p><b>CHOICE: When is the Last Time You Were REALLY Given a Choice?</b></p>
<p>NEBI.MOBI services allow you to use EVE 008 or your own smartphone. You get to choose. This is real choice. No contracts attached. We refuse to impose limits like cell providers.</p>
<p><b>The Science and More</b></p>
<p>Cellular networks, Wi-Fi, VoIP, expanding network infrastructures, GSM, codecs, telecom providers… It can be overwhelming. We have done the research, studied the options, explored the field, experimented, and applied the science. We have designed and manufactured a value-oriented smartphone capable of operating via Wi-Fi or current mobile carriers. Our Android OS has been boosted for higher power efficiency. We have submitted for trademarks, secured FCC license approvals, negotiated service contracts, and coded and test our apps and service architecture. </p>
<p>As we begin, we will need a lot of subscribers with current Wi-Fi optimized VOIP devices to help us drive down the wholesale minutes pricing from telecom servers. We want to make sure that we can support the greatest number of customers with optimal bandwidth for a positive user experience. </p>
<p>Another use of funds will be the deployment of free public Wi-Fi coverage. We want to expand the availability to more places so that everyone, whether they use our service or not, has access to free public Wi-Fi. </p>
<p><b>Reasons You May Not Have Considered that Might Make You Go Hmmm….</b></p>
<p>This device and network has more value than you may think. With our system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teens cannot text and drive as they move through active Wi-Fi zones</li>
<li>You can travel worldwide and avoid roaming charges once our Wi-Fi based phone service is live</li>
<li>You can resell your old expensive cell phone at near retail and use one that’s even better - Pocket the extra savings from the resale</li>
<li>The two SIM card strategy allows you to carry one phone for two lines</li>
<li>No contracts</li>
<li>No dragging around a separate charger with our quick-swap battery</li>
<li>You can let your young child play games on EVE 008, which you surely shouldn’t do with a $600-$800 smartphone</li>
<li>SD card slot for expansion and easy transfer of data – no technical assistance or fancy programs needed</li>
<li>Tons of Android Apps available for use with EVE 008</li>
<li>Skype and Wi-Fi chat applications allow communications with family and friends around the world</li>
<li>EVE 008 can serve as a low cost temporary or permanent replacement phone if your current smartphone is stolen or broken </li>
<li>NEBI.MOBI can easily replace home phone service as a much lower cost option</li>
<li>Regardless from reaching to our funding goal, anyone who donates $175 will receive EVE 008 with our thanks - No tax, no shipping, no handling charges! What a great value!</li>
<li>As soon as we have the funding and are ready to activate NEBI.MOBI service, our backers will pay only $60/YEAR for the unlimited mobile phone service</li>
<li>EVE 008 is totally hot—have you seen her pics?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Innovation and the New Era of Smartphones Needs You</b></p>
<p>My wife and I believe in innovation. We believe in this project. We have invested time and money into establishing as much as we can and now we need help to get this project off the ground and let it fly. Your donation will be a part of a new era of smartphone services. The funds raised will be used to launch the platform, acquire users, and drive down the price of our devices and services. Higher volume equals lower costs to consumers. We need to pay for high-end telecom servers to ensure proper levels of bandwidth for the best experience for our customers. Funds will also help us deploy our plans for increased free Wi-Fi coverage. </p>
<p><b>This is a</b><b> REVOLUTION</b></p>
<p>Be a REBEL—<b>R</b>evolutionary <b>E</b>volution <b>B</b>acker for <b>E</b>scape from <b>L</b>imitations. Escape from the constraints of the same old mobile delivery systems that have been around forever. They keep charging more because they think we are trapped. It’s time to show them that the Innovation Revolution has started and you are a part of it. How many times does an opportunity like this present itself? In this industry, not very often. In fact, almost never. Be a REBEL and join the revolution. It’s like the Boston Tea Party for the 21st century.</p>
<p><b>Can I Really Make a Difference and What’s in it for Me Besides Awesome REBEL status?</b></p>
<p>To be a part of NEBI.MOBI, you can do two things. First, you can spread the word. Tell people about us. Tell them what we are doing. Show them the EVE 008 specs and cool features. See how your friends and connections feel about freedom from cellular carriers and expensive plans and devices. Link to our campaign. Use your social media to help us educate people about our project. Tell them to be a REBEL! Encourage people to unchain themselves from the cellular carriers who hold them captive! They take your business for granted believing you have no alternative. BUT YOU DO. We need you to help us get this message out! Help the Revolution grow. Add to our REBELs!</p>
<p>Second, you can make a monetary contribution to help us finish up funding the project. We’ve done a lot on our own, but we still need some help. As for you, there are some really awesome perks and rewards for making donations. T-shirts, parties, free smartphones, starring in our advertising, and naming our next mobile device model are up for grabs along with other thank you gifts. In fact, the first 50 backers at the $149 level will receive an EVE 008 with our thanks! The best reward will be your freedom from cellular providers. Let’s face it, we’re all sick of their manipulations. </p>
<p>If we cannot reach our goal on Indiegogo, it will be impossible for us to secure competitive pricing from potential vendors in a timely manner. If we can reach our goal, we will be able to pass along cost savings to our customers. We want to provide you with unlimited mobile service for $60 per year or less, and an affordable, efficient, optimized mobile device for the lowest possible cost to you without requiring any contracts.</p>
<p>This is the first REAL innovation in the mobile industry and you can be a part of it. Claim your status as a founder of the new wave. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Achievement of our goal will allow us to move to our Stretch Goals, including specialized EVE 008 cases and extra batteries. </p>

</div><br/></div>","Cellular Providers are Being Put on NoticeCellular providers are continually telling us that they have the best plans for us. The plans are new and improved to give us just what we need… at an excessive cost. The latest smartphone has the most “amazing” new features… but they aren’t innovative at all. NEBI.MOBI is the most cost-effective, innovative service and smartphone to ever hit the market. Cell phone providers think they have a lock on the services, but NEBI.MOBI, with your help, is going to show them how it’s really done.As Seen On            What Cellular Telephone Services Don’t Tell You—AKA The DeceptionTelephone data is transformed from analog to digital content. All cell phone plans indicate a separation between talking minutes, number of text messages, and amount of data use. These are actually all the same service, provided the same way. By separating them and limiting amounts of each one for different packages, they deceive consumers into believing that different rates should apply to talk, text, and data. Why are we paying three different rates with different limitations for the same thing? All of these services are digitally provided. They should all be unlimited at one low price. This is a sales gimmick and it locks customers into two year contracts and fees for overages that are outrageous. No More Hype, Just Honesty and InnovationWe need to move away from the hype and misleading information of cellular providers and their famous two year contracts and three prices for the same service. Instead of depending on cellular network signals, at NEBI.MOBI we are using Wi-Fi based network signals and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies to deliver superior service without the inflated price tag. These technologies are capable of supporting talk, text, and data – which is really all just data. This will bring smartphones to an entirely new level of capability and accessibility. That’s right, innovation in the mobile industry. This is a rare gem.Can I use VOIP?VOIP technology has become increasingly efficient. Our codecs secure encrypted connections and maintain lightning-fast data transfer speed. Smartphone designs, whether you consider ours or your current phone, have advanced to the point of being able to support VOIP apps reliably.Is Wi-Fi Up to the Challenge?
Wi-Fi is not controlled by government agencies and does not incur huge government-related fees and taxes. Wi-Fi signals have increased in capability and availability to a point that makes it faster and easier to access from a growing number of sources every day. We believe that free public Wi-Fi access should be available in every city. Free public access should be provided by each city’s leaders as a show of understanding of the importance of communication and connection in today’s world. One of our goals with funding of NEBI.MOBI is to increase advocacy nationwide for free public Wi-Fi in entire cities. Until we fully succeed, you can supplement your Wi-Fi access points through data-only cellular plans for achieving a wider coverage area, and still enjoy substantial savings compared to your traditional smartphone bills. You deserve to be able to connect wherever you are, without having to search for a free hotspot or pay a cellular service for data usage.

Meet EVE 008—She’s Gorgeous and Highly Capable
EVE 008 is our remarkable touchscreen smartphone. It actually has a replaceable battery that will eliminate the need for bulky charging cases or a tangle of charging cords and panicked searches for places to charge your phone. Two phone lines can be combined on one device by using two SIM card services simultaneously, eliminating the need for a work and home cell phone, lightening the load in your purse or pocket. An SD slot allows for expansion and transfer of data without dealing with additional technology or apps. Data is saved even if the phone is injured. And EVE 008 doesn’t carry the price tag of smartphones with even half of her capability. That doesn’t even begin to describe what EVE 008 can do for you.
EVE 008’s specs:

Dual SIM Card (1 Standard, 1 Micro) 
Android 4.2.2 
Quad-core 1.3 GHz Processor 
RAM 1GB 
Internal Storage 4GB 
SD Card slot for 32GB storage expansion 
FM Radio 
A-GPS 
Bluetooth 4.0 
Wi-Fi and mobile AP 
IPS bright screen, 4.5 inch multi-touch 
Ultra-slim body, 0.346 inch thin 
Lithium swappable battery, 2000 mAh 
Software supported 8MP camera with LED flash light 
Software supported 2MP front facing camera 
Quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900 Mhz) for World-Wide compatibility 
4G network data speeds (i.e. T-Mobile, AT&T, Metro PCS and more for US)
Special fast charger, USB cable, and noise canceling headphones are included






CHOICE: When is the Last Time You Were REALLY Given a Choice?
NEBI.MOBI services allow you to use EVE 008 or your own smartphone. You get to choose. This is real choice. No contracts attached. We refuse to impose limits like cell providers.
The Science and More
Cellular networks, Wi-Fi, VoIP, expanding network infrastructures, GSM, codecs, telecom providers… It can be overwhelming. We have done the research, studied the options, explored the field, experimented, and applied the science. We have designed and manufactured a value-oriented smartphone capable of operating via Wi-Fi or current mobile carriers. Our Android OS has been boosted for higher power efficiency. We have submitted for trademarks, secured FCC license approvals, negotiated service contracts, and coded and test our apps and service architecture. 
As we begin, we will need a lot of subscribers with current Wi-Fi optimized VOIP devices to help us drive down the wholesale minutes pricing from telecom servers. We want to make sure that we can support the greatest number of customers with optimal bandwidth for a positive user experience. 
Another use of funds will be the deployment of free public Wi-Fi coverage. We want to expand the availability to more places so that everyone, whether they use our service or not, has access to free public Wi-Fi. 
Reasons You May Not Have Considered that Might Make You Go Hmmm….
This device and network has more value than you may think. With our system:

Teens cannot text and drive as they move through active Wi-Fi zones
You can travel worldwide and avoid roaming charges once our Wi-Fi based phone service is live
You can resell your old expensive cell phone at near retail and use one that’s even better - Pocket the extra savings from the resale
The two SIM card strategy allows you to carry one phone for two lines
No contracts
No dragging around a separate charger with our quick-swap battery
You can let your young child play games on EVE 008, which you surely shouldn’t do with a $600-$800 smartphone
SD card slot for expansion and easy transfer of data – no technical assistance or fancy programs needed
Tons of Android Apps available for use with EVE 008
Skype and Wi-Fi chat applications allow communications with family and friends around the world
EVE 008 can serve as a low cost temporary or permanent replacement phone if your current smartphone is stolen or broken 
NEBI.MOBI can easily replace home phone service as a much lower cost option
Regardless from reaching to our funding goal, anyone who donates $175 will receive EVE 008 with our thanks - No tax, no shipping, no handling charges! What a great value!
As soon as we have the funding and are ready to activate NEBI.MOBI service, our backers will pay only $60/YEAR for the unlimited mobile phone service
EVE 008 is totally hot—have you seen her pics?

Innovation and the New Era of Smartphones Needs You
My wife and I believe in innovation. We believe in this project. We have invested time and money into establishing as much as we can and now we need help to get this project off the ground and let it fly. Your donation will be a part of a new era of smartphone services. The funds raised will be used to launch the platform, acquire users, and drive down the price of our devices and services. Higher volume equals lower costs to consumers. We need to pay for high-end telecom servers to ensure proper levels of bandwidth for the best experience for our customers. Funds will also help us deploy our plans for increased free Wi-Fi coverage. 
This is a REVOLUTION
Be a REBEL—Revolutionary Evolution Backer for Escape from Limitations. Escape from the constraints of the same old mobile delivery systems that have been around forever. They keep charging more because they think we are trapped. It’s time to show them that the Innovation Revolution has started and you are a part of it. How many times does an opportunity like this present itself? In this industry, not very often. In fact, almost never. Be a REBEL and join the revolution. It’s like the Boston Tea Party for the 21st century.
Can I Really Make a Difference and What’s in it for Me Besides Awesome REBEL status?
To be a part of NEBI.MOBI, you can do two things. First, you can spread the word. Tell people about us. Tell them what we are doing. Show them the EVE 008 specs and cool features. See how your friends and connections feel about freedom from cellular carriers and expensive plans and devices. Link to our campaign. Use your social media to help us educate people about our project. Tell them to be a REBEL! Encourage people to unchain themselves from the cellular carriers who hold them captive! They take your business for granted believing you have no alternative. BUT YOU DO. We need you to help us get this message out! Help the Revolution grow. Add to our REBELs!
Second, you can make a monetary contribution to help us finish up funding the project. We’ve done a lot on our own, but we still need some help. As for you, there are some really awesome perks and rewards for making donations. T-shirts, parties, free smartphones, starring in our advertising, and naming our next mobile device model are up for grabs along with other thank you gifts. In fact, the first 50 backers at the $149 level will receive an EVE 008 with our thanks! The best reward will be your freedom from cellular providers. Let’s face it, we’re all sick of their manipulations. 
If we cannot reach our goal on Indiegogo, it will be impossible for us to secure competitive pricing from potential vendors in a timely manner. If we can reach our goal, we will be able to pass along cost savings to our customers. We want to provide you with unlimited mobile service for $60 per year or less, and an affordable, efficient, optimized mobile device for the lowest possible cost to you without requiring any contracts.
This is the first REAL innovation in the mobile industry and you can be a part of it. Claim your status as a founder of the new wave. How cool is that?
Achievement of our goal will allow us to move to our Stretch Goals, including specialized EVE 008 cases and extra batteries. 

Yes, this is an ambitious target for us, but it is very possible to hit with your support. Reaching these levels of a volume reduces our manufacturing cost per device, and we would like pass such savings to you by including a beautiful, custom fit, see-through case for protecting your smartphone… 


Successfully funding this much means that we now reached to a production volume that makes economically feasible to manufacture our smartphones in additional colors without an extra cost to our backers. Now, you can select what color you would like for yourself…


Wow, this is like a dream number for us. This amount of a funding will also allow us to take advantage of some serious economies of scale. We will be able to send you an extra battery with each EVE 008 device, too… Thank you a million times…

<h2><span style=""font-size: x-large;"">NOTE: Project funding/pre-orders have now ended! If you want to get your hands on sympleSEQ when it is ready to ship, subscribe to the hexinverter.net email list here! You will then receive an email when it becomes in stock in my web-shop:</span></h2>
<div><span style=""font-size: x-large;""><a href=""http://blog.hexinverter.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://blog.hexinverter.net</a></span></div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Intro - what is the sympleSEQ, and why do I need it?</h2>
<p>Many step-sequencer kits exist on the market for use with analog modular synthesizers, but unfortunately the vast majority of them are extremely intimidating for builders to put together due to all of the off-board wiring that is required of the builder. Every step in the sequencer requires a substantial amount of wiring to the potentiometer, switch and LED for that step. The task of wiring a large, multi-channel sequencer for programming drums or complex patterns becomes a pretty daunting task.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>sympleSEQ is here to change this, though, and offers a unique dual-board, scalable design that enables hobbyists to build a fully-functional, 8-step analog sequencer for use with their modular synthesizer (or other control-voltage based synthesizer). The two boards connect together through a header system that makes it a breeze to assemble. A carefully designed PCB set along with other component-kits offers different options for builders to assemble their very own analog step-sequencer with ease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What makes sympleSEQ unique is its use of board-mount potentiometers, switches and LEDs. The task of wiring the panel controls becomes easy when you just have to snap them into the board and solder in place instead of tediously running wires to everything. Best of all, sympleSEQ offers a circuit board package where all of the specific parts you require that are special to this design are <em>included!</em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>sympleSEQ also offers a thorough instruction manual, with printable drill template for easily drilling holes in your panel to accept the control-surface board. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>By offering a fundraising project like this, I am able to source parts and circuit boards at cheaper prices, and reduce the cost of building the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to visit the <a href=""http://electro-music.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=49287"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">electro-music.com forum</a> where I reside, which will serve as another place for this project, and a help-forum/questions answering place for anyone that has them!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: The image which you see above is the prototype board, and thus is going to be much uglier than the production-run boards. Your controls will also mount properly to the front-panel, unlike mine which were slightly off due to the hand-made boards. I also used non board mount switches in my handmade board; the production boards use PCB mount switches so are much better aligned and secured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of the board CAD renderings. With a few cosmetic tweaks, they will be ready for production as double-layer, silk-screened, solder masked boards!</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<div>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>- 8 programmable steps of control voltage</p>
<p>- Can fit vertically into 1U wide of MOTM style panel space</p>
<p>- 2 sequencers fit into 3U high Eurorack panel space</p>
<p>- All 8 steps have note on/off switches to turn the summed gate off for that step</p>
<p>- All steps output a short gate to make use of envelope generators (unlike many ""Baby10"" designs which tie the notes together). This should work to trigger drums as well.</p>
<p>- Select from 2-8 steps via the same toggles used for gate on/off. This addition does not make the design more complex, which is a plus!</p>
<p>- CV (contol voltage) output for interfacing with any analog gear</p>
<p>- Extremely easy to assemble (even for beginners!)</p>
<p>- Easily scalable with detailed instructions on how to do so (build as many channels as you want, all running off of the same master tempo clock!)</p>
<p>- Power supply can be a 9V battery, +12V or +15V to accommodate a wide variety of system formats and portability!</p>
<p>- 161x41mm board space needed to mount the control panel</p>
<p>- Included detailed instruction manual with easy-mode drilling template for the front panel!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Optional Features</h2>
<p>- Easily add external clocking (CMOS level - compatible with the MFOS 16 step and others I am sure)</p>
<p>- The option is there to add external/switch controlled Reset -- external Stop/Pause is in beta phase and may or may not be included in the final design suggestion.</p>
<p>- Either of these features can be triggered by your choice of switch, positive voltage signal, or both</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h2>4 different kit offerings to satisfy all ranges of builders!</h2>
<p>The sympleSEQ project has been carefully designed to fill a rather large market-gap in the world of analog synthesis that exists due to there being no simple to build sequencers out there. Thus, it is only natural that it also satisfies many types of builders by offering 4<em> different kit-complexities for builders to select from.</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<p>NOTE: <em>Every</em> kit contains a set of PCBs of course! -- the only difference is in the components included.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1.) Full component kit -- for new (or lazy) builders</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>
<p>- One set of sympleSEQ PCBs</p>
<p>- All of the necessary components required to electrically build the sympleSEQ, including board mount switches, potentiometers, hardware to mount the board and the headers which connect the boards together.</p>
<p>- <em>NO knobs or jacks</em>, as these are dependent on the person's personal taste/system format.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2.) Minimal component kit -- for those that wish to source their own common components</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">3.) PCB set only -- for those that wish to order their own components</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>
<p>- One set of sympleSEQ PCBs</p>
<p>- Headers to connect the boards together</p>
<p>- Hardware to mount the board to the front panel</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">4.) The multi-channel DIY extravaganza -- for those that wish to build a large 4-channel sequencer, a discount is offered on PCB/hardware sets</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>
<p>- Enough components to build a FOUR channel monster step-sequencer! <em><strong>The kit includes 4x Option #1</strong></em></p>
<p>- Your name gets a special mention in the instruction manual as a person who helped immensely in making this project happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Bill of Materials</strong></h2>
<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvD8ZRA_UZL8dEFER2dMWXFmVWs5cE11ZnYyVF9LVnc&amp;hl=en_US"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av...</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>So, what's <em>NOT</em> included in a full kit?</h2>
<div><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">You will need:</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>- Tools (soldering iron, wire clippers, etc)</div>
<div>- Hook up wire</div>
<div>- 2+ Jacks (minimum one for CV and one for GATE -- more for extra features like reset/pause or clock in/out) -- banana, 1/4"", 1/8"", whatever you use -- that is why they are not included!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">These are optional:</span></div>
<div><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></div>
<div>- 8x 6mm shaft Knobs - <strong>maximum 19mm diameter</strong> (personally, I like the pot shafts without knobs as they have a pointer on them!)</div>
<div>- 2x switches and .01uF ceramic capacitors for reset/pause if you desire switches and jacks.</div>
<div>- 2x jacks for clock in/out</div>
<div>- 2x jacks for reset in and pause in</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>So, where is the money going exactly, and how does this work?</h2>
<p>I would be asking the same thing right about now if I were in your seat, of course! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>First off, the $2,800 campaign goal is not an arbitrarily selected value. I have made precise calculations in order to determine the cost of ordering enough boards and materials for the projected amount of sales. This includes everything from face-value cost, to shipping, customs duties and PayPal fees all associated with running this project!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you select a level of contribution from the right, and contribute funds to this project, it is accumulated until the end of October. Once the campaign is complete, all of the parts, circuit boards and items required to piece together kits for all of the contributors will be ordered and accumulated until they are ready to go!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>The contribution value at the right includes shipping to your door!</em></strong> I realize a lot of people come from all over the world, so have calculated a generic shipping value that everyone will pay in order to minimize confusion of payments. Inevitably, some will be cheaper, and some will be more expensive. It is my hope that it will balance out perfectly :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When you contribute, there is an option to leave your shipping address. Do this, and when the kits are ready, they will be mailed out to you lickety-split! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may also go and visit the forums over on electro-music where this project originated to become notified of </p>
<p> </p>
<p>updates on the project and to track the completion of parts orders. I will of course be updating the thread frequently and notifying everyone of when everything ships out to people. I will do the same on this site as well!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hate waiting as well, but this is the only way this project can happen! It is of the utmost importance to me that I ship everyone's kits to them as quickly as possible, so rest assured that I will not stall when it comes time to order and ship your goods!</p>
<p> </p>

Intro - what is the sympleSEQ, and why do I need it?
Many step-sequencer kits exist on the market for use with analog modular synthesizers, but unfortunately the vast majority of them are extremely intimidating for builders to put together due to all of the off-board wiring that is required of the builder. Every step in the sequencer requires a substantial amount of wiring to the potentiometer, switch and LED for that step. The task of wiring a large, multi-channel sequencer for programming drums or complex patterns becomes a pretty daunting task.
 
sympleSEQ is here to change this, though, and offers a unique dual-board, scalable design that enables hobbyists to build a fully-functional, 8-step analog sequencer for use with their modular synthesizer (or other control-voltage based synthesizer). The two boards connect together through a header system that makes it a breeze to assemble. A carefully designed PCB set along with other component-kits offers different options for builders to assemble their very own analog step-sequencer with ease.
 
What makes sympleSEQ unique is its use of board-mount potentiometers, switches and LEDs. The task of wiring the panel controls becomes easy when you just have to snap them into the board and solder in place instead of tediously running wires to everything. Best of all, sympleSEQ offers a circuit board package where all of the specific parts you require that are special to this design are included! 
 
sympleSEQ also offers a thorough instruction manual, with printable drill template for easily drilling holes in your panel to accept the control-surface board. 
 
By offering a fundraising project like this, I am able to source parts and circuit boards at cheaper prices, and reduce the cost of building the project.
 
Please don't hesitate to visit the electro-music.com forum where I reside, which will serve as another place for this project, and a help-forum/questions answering place for anyone that has them!
 
NOTE: The image which you see above is the prototype board, and thus is going to be much uglier than the production-run boards. Your controls will also mount properly to the front-panel, unlike mine which were slightly off due to the hand-made boards. I also used non board mount switches in my handmade board; the production boards use PCB mount switches so are much better aligned and secured.
 
Here is a snapshot of the board CAD renderings. With a few cosmetic tweaks, they will be ready for production as double-layer, silk-screened, solder masked boards!
 

 


Key Features
 
- 8 programmable steps of control voltage
- Can fit vertically into 1U wide of MOTM style panel space
- 2 sequencers fit into 3U high Eurorack panel space
- All 8 steps have note on/off switches to turn the summed gate off for that step
- All steps output a short gate to make use of envelope generators (unlike many ""Baby10"" designs which tie the notes together). This should work to trigger drums as well.
- Select from 2-8 steps via the same toggles used for gate on/off. This addition does not make the design more complex, which is a plus!
- CV (contol voltage) output for interfacing with any analog gear
- Extremely easy to assemble (even for beginners!)
- Easily scalable with detailed instructions on how to do so (build as many channels as you want, all running off of the same master tempo clock!)
- Power supply can be a 9V battery, +12V or +15V to accommodate a wide variety of system formats and portability!
- 161x41mm board space needed to mount the control panel
- Included detailed instruction manual with easy-mode drilling template for the front panel!
 
Optional Features
- Easily add external clocking (CMOS level - compatible with the MFOS 16 step and others I am sure)
- The option is there to add external/switch controlled Reset -- external Stop/Pause is in beta phase and may or may not be included in the final design suggestion.
- Either of these features can be triggered by your choice of switch, positive voltage signal, or both
 
 


4 different kit offerings to satisfy all ranges of builders!
The sympleSEQ project has been carefully designed to fill a rather large market-gap in the world of analog synthesis that exists due to there being no simple to build sequencers out there. Thus, it is only natural that it also satisfies many types of builders by offering 4 different kit-complexities for builders to select from.

NOTE: Every kit contains a set of PCBs of course! -- the only difference is in the components included.
 
1.) Full component kit -- for new (or lazy) builders

Contents:
- One set of sympleSEQ PCBs
- All of the necessary components required to electrically build the sympleSEQ, including board mount switches, potentiometers, hardware to mount the board and the headers which connect the boards together.
- NO knobs or jacks, as these are dependent on the person's personal taste/system format.
 
2.) Minimal component kit -- for those that wish to source their own common components

 
Contents:
- One set of sympleSEQ PCBs
- 8x board mount potentiometers
- 8x board mount switches
- Headers to connect the boards together
- Hardware to mount the board to the front panel
 

3.) PCB set only -- for those that wish to order their own components

 
Contents:
- One set of sympleSEQ PCBs
- Headers to connect the boards together
- Hardware to mount the board to the front panel
 

4.) The multi-channel DIY extravaganza -- for those that wish to build a large 4-channel sequencer, a discount is offered on PCB/hardware sets

 
Contents:
- Enough components to build a FOUR channel monster step-sequencer! The kit includes 4x Option #1
- Your name gets a special mention in the instruction manual as a person who helped immensely in making this project happen!
 
Bill of Materials
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Av...
 
So, what's NOT included in a full kit?
You will need:
 
- Tools (soldering iron, wire clippers, etc)
- Hook up wire
- 2+ Jacks (minimum one for CV and one for GATE -- more for extra features like reset/pause or clock in/out) -- banana, 1/4"", 1/8"", whatever you use -- that is why they are not included!
 
These are optional:

- 8x 6mm shaft Knobs - maximum 19mm diameter (personally, I like the pot shafts without knobs as they have a pointer on them!)
- 2x switches and .01uF ceramic capacitors for reset/pause if you desire switches and jacks.
- 2x jacks for clock in/out
- 2x jacks for reset in and pause in
 


So, where is the money going exactly, and how does this work?
I would be asking the same thing right about now if I were in your seat, of course! 
 
First off, the $2,800 campaign goal is not an arbitrarily selected value. I have made precise calculations in order to determine the cost of ordering enough boards and materials for the projected amount of sales. This includes everything from face-value cost, to shipping, customs duties and PayPal fees all associated with running this project!
 
When you select a level of contribution from the right, and contribute funds to this project, it is accumulated until the end of October. Once the campaign is complete, all of the parts, circuit boards and items required to piece together kits for all of the contributors will be ordered and accumulated until they are ready to go!
 
The contribution value at the right includes shipping to your door! I realize a lot of people come from all over the world, so have calculated a generic shipping value that everyone will pay in order to minimize confusion of payments. Inevitably, some will be cheaper, and some will be more expensive. It is my hope that it will balance out perfectly :)
 
When you contribute, there is an option to leave your shipping address. Do this, and when the kits are ready, they will be mailed out to you lickety-split! 
 
You may also go and visit the forums over on electro-music where this project originated to become notified of 
 
updates on the project and to track the completion of parts orders. I will of course be updating the thread frequently and notifying everyone of when everything ships out to people. I will do the same on this site as well!
 
I hate waiting as well, but this is the only way this project can happen! It is of the utmost importance to me that I ship everyone's kits to them as quickly as possible, so rest assured that I will not stall when it comes time to order and ship your goods!",3.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Flyover Innovations LLC, a consumer electronics startup company, is finalizing the development of our first product - Blumoo - an open source hardware platform capable of controlling your home theater equipment and streaming music to your existing stereo equipment all from your favorite mobile device.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTgL6YUBpu4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Blumoo Bob"" border=""2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://flyoverinnovations.com/images/Blumoo%20Bob%20Video%20Image"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p> No need to waste your money buying inadequate Bluetooth speakers or high-end receivers to get the convenience of remote control and streaming from your mobile device.  Keep your existing system and add premium functionality with Blumoo.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Typical Use Cases"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/804722/pictures/full/20130531202340-use_case2.png?1370057024"" src="""" style="""" title=""Typical Use Cases""/></p>
<p><strong>How does Blumoo work?</strong></p>
<p>Blumoo connects to your mobile device via Bluetooth technology to enable both universal remote control functionality and hi-fi audio streaming.</p>
<p><img alt=""Blumoo Connections"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/843612/pictures/full/20130531191208-Blumoo_Overview.png?1370052731"" src="""" style="""" title=""Blumoo Connections""/>The Blumoo app (iOS and Android) that you download to your mobile device automatically loads the appropriate remote control database for your equipment.  The Blumoo app provides a simple, intuitive user interface on your mobile device for stereo controls as well as quick access to your media libraries and favorite streaming music apps.</p>
<p>The Blumoo ""pod"" integrates a powerful infrared (IR) transmitter that is universally compatible with standard home theater equipment.  Blumoo will be able to control all of your equipment from the primary ""pod"" IR transmitter for typical installations.  If it is desired to control several theater devices that are separated by closed cabinets, an additional IR emitter may be used to reach all devices.  Blumoo has an additional port on the cable that, if desired, can accept a readily-available, standard 3.5mm IR emitter cable.  Since the IR transmitter is located inside the stationary Blumoo ""pod"", your phone becomes the remote control to your standard equipment without the 'line-of-sight' limitations that are typical with most remote controls.  </p>
<p>Audio from your mobile device is transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth to Blumoo.  The audio is transmitted to the receiver from Blumoo via standard 3.5mm jack or RCA connections.  </p>
<p> <img alt=""Protoype Blumoo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/804766/pictures/full/20130527120254-BLUMOO_proto.png?1369681380"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prototype Blumoo""/></p>
<p> <strong>What does the Blumoo app do?</strong></p>
<p>The Blumoo app provides the remote control interface to your stereo equipment and quick access to your streaming and media app's.  To maintain an intuitive interface to the user, only relevant controls for the selected mode will be displayed.</p>
<p>If we can achieve our stretch goal, we will be able to create a full universal remote control app for iOS and Android to control all of your home entertainment equipment (TV, Blu-Ray, DVD Player, Receiver, Satellite, Cable Box, etc) - all from your single Blumoo hardware device!</p>
<p><img alt=""Blumoo iOS/Andoid App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/831047/pictures/full/20130525131919-Remote_Control_App_compat.png?1369513162"" src="""" style="""" title=""Blumoo iOS/Andoid App""/></p>
<p>The standard main screen of the iOS/Android app includes quick access to power on the stereo receiver, volume control, and auxiliary selection.</p>
<p>If you are on your streaming auxiliary, you can access your media libraries or streaming app's by tapping the music icon.</p>
<p>If you are on CD or Tuner, you'll get quick access controls relevant for those functions.</p>

<p><strong>Expandability</strong></p>
<p>Blumoo is a flexible hardware platform that can be used to control any device with an infrared remote control (TV, DVD &amp; Blu Ray players, Satellite Box, Cable Box, Projectors, Soundbars, and much more) associated with it from your mobile device.  Following launch we will provide an open API with our comprehensive IR code database to enable developers at-large to modify, expand, and make new Blumoo app variants!  The database is extremely large so we won't be posting it on here, but feel free to contact us if you have any specific questions of what the database includes...if it has an IR interface and you want to control it, theres a good chance our database includes it.</p>
<p><strong>How do you set up Blumoo?</strong></p>
<p>We designed the Blumoo hardware and app entirely around simplicity.  The entire Blumoo experience - from set-up to daily use - revolves around ease of use for you.</p>
<p><img alt=""Simple, Simple, Simple"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/804822/pictures/full/20130511132826-Setup.png?1368304112"" src="""" style="""" title=""Simple Setup""/></p>

<p><strong>OUR STRETCH GOAL</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If we can reach $40,000...</em></strong></p>
<p>We have concentrated on stereo control for the included app because this is a such a common use case and yet no device exists on the market to provide both full control and streaming capability to your existing equipment from your mobile device. <em><strong> BUT...Blumoo can control all of your home theater equipment.  </strong></em>If we are able to exceed our goal and reach $40,000 we will be able to create a full universal remote control app for all of your home theater equipment (tv, blu-ray, dvd, projector, satellite, cable box, etc) and send it to all donors that purchased any Blumoo package!!!</p>
<p><strong>Included in the Blumoo Product Package:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blumoo ""pod""</li>
<li>Blumoo app download (iOS or Android)</li>
<li>Audio cable with 3.5mm jack</li>
<li>Power cable and outlet connection</li>
<li>Blumoo setup guide</li>
</ul><p><strong>What will we do with Indiegogo funding?</strong></p>
<p>We are a small startup company with big dreams - <strong><em>we need your help to realize these dreams!</em></strong>  With a successful campaign, we can bring Blumoo to market and get Flyover Innovations off the ground.</p>
<p>The funds raised from this Indiegogo campaign will enable us to take Blumoo into production.  We can begin cutting tooling for the composite parts and purchase components for the first build.</p>

<p><strong><em>iOS and Android App: </em></strong>Blumoo app development is currently underway.  The app is currently functional, however, we are continuing efforts to refine it in order to ensure that we have a remote control interface that's intuitive and simple with the necessary features. </p>
<p><em><strong>Mechanical:</strong> </em>Initial design is complete and undergoing testing and evaluation.  Ready to cut tooling!</p>
<p><em><strong>Manufacturing and Supply Chain:</strong> </em>We have already visited, audited, and established a partnership with a reputable manufacturing company.</p>
<p><strong>Will the final product differ from the prototype shown in the video?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Blumoo ""Pod""</strong> </em>- The prototype Blumoo ""pod"" looks very similar to what it will look like in production.  However, there are two items that will be slightly different on production versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Blumoo logo will be silkscreened on the lower front of the case</li>
<li>The production cable will have the power, 3.5mm audio, and 3.5mm optional IR extender jacks injection molded into a harness </li>

<p><em><strong>Blumoo ""App""</strong> </em>- The App will maintain a similar layout as shown in the demo.  There may be some slight modifications to the graphic symbols used and the page layout as we finalize the UI.  Updated screenshots will be provided if changes are made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>As questions come in, we'll update them here:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.  What version of Bluetooth is used on Blumoo?</strong></p>
<p><em>We are using Bluetooth v4.0.  We use A2DP profile for stereo audio transfer and SPP for remote control transfer between Blumoo and your mobile device.</em></p>
<p><strong>2.  What if I have both an Android and an iOS device in my house - can I get both app downloads with a purchased package?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Blumoo apps will be readily available for free download.</p>
<p><strong>3.  What control functions are built into the app? What devices can it control?</strong></p>
<p>The standard app will be launched as a music controller - it will be capable of controlling your receiver/tuner, and CD player.  The controls that are displayed on the app are relevant for the auxiliary that is selected. For example, if you select ""tuner"" then the controls displayed would be Power, Volume Control, Tune Up/Down, and your Preset Station selections.  If you selected ""CD"" as the auxiliary, the controls would be Power, Volume Control, Skip Forward/Back, Pause, Stop, and Disk Change.  If you select an open Aux we will default to showing streaming media controls - receiver Power, Volume Control, access to your mobile devices stored music (itunes, android music player) and access to your streaming app's (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc).  If we are able to achieve our stretch goal, we will create an app that will allow you to use Blumoo to control all of your home theater devices (TV, DVD player, Stereo, Cable Box, etc).  Suggestions for additions to the app?  Let us know!!</p>
<p><strong>4.  Can I have more than one device connected to Blumoo at a time?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We are targeting the ability to have 5 devices connected to Blumoo at a time!  We don't like looking for remotes, so we don't want you searching for your phone either...pick up whatever mobile device is closest to you (phone, tablet, itouch) and start controlling/streaming!</p>
<p><strong>5.  When the full universal app is created that is able to control all of my home theater equipment (TV, DVD Player, Stereo, Cable Box, etc), will I need to add more Blumoo's or will one device be able to control all of these?</strong></p>
<p>As long as all of your devices are in relatively close proximity as they typically are in a standard living room or theater installation, a single Blumoo hardware device will be able to control all of these devices.  If you have a device that is outside of the proximity (e.g. in a closed cabinet that will be away from the Blumoo ""Pod"") you can simply plug in an IR extension dongle into the available port on the Blumoo ""Pod"" cable. </p>
<p><strong>6.  Is there a 'learning' function for the unit if my equipment is not in the database?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We have incorporated a ""learning"" mode into the Blumoo in the rare chance that your equipment or specific control command is not included in the database.  If you are curious if your equipment is covered in the database, shoot me a message and I'll check for you! </p>

<p><strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>Flyover Innovations was founded by Jason Carman and Mark Vogt with the desire to give consumers access to elegant, high-quality, consumer electronic devices that are simple to set-up and use.</p>
<p>Mark and Jason met each other more than 10 years ago working as engineers for GPS manufacturer, Garmin.  Entrepreneurs at heart, we realized that many people were not utilizing technology to the fullest extent in many real-world scenarios...the reason? Over and over again people stated that it was too difficult to set up and/or use.  </p>
<p>In 2012, Jason and Mark decided to pair up and try to make a difference.  We cherry picked exceptional talent for the team and founded Flyover Innovations LLC. The core motto behind the team is a strict focus on complete user experience - from setup through daily use.  It's simple - technology should be used to simplify our lives, not complicate it.  We also believe in the fundamental importance and strength of community-developed products. This is why we are launching the Blumoo platform with an open API to enable app developers in the community to continue to add new features and functions to the product.</p>
<p>A sincere thank you for helping our team get a start in building a truly user-focused company.</p>

Flyover Innovations LLC, a consumer electronics startup company, is finalizing the development of our first product - Blumoo - an open source hardware platform capable of controlling your home theater equipment and streaming music to your existing stereo equipment all from your favorite mobile device.

 No need to waste your money buying inadequate Bluetooth speakers or high-end receivers to get the convenience of remote control and streaming from your mobile device.  Keep your existing system and add premium functionality with Blumoo.
 
How does Blumoo work?
Blumoo connects to your mobile device via Bluetooth technology to enable both universal remote control functionality and hi-fi audio streaming.
The Blumoo app (iOS and Android) that you download to your mobile device automatically loads the appropriate remote control database for your equipment.  The Blumoo app provides a simple, intuitive user interface on your mobile device for stereo controls as well as quick access to your media libraries and favorite streaming music apps.
The Blumoo ""pod"" integrates a powerful infrared (IR) transmitter that is universally compatible with standard home theater equipment.  Blumoo will be able to control all of your equipment from the primary ""pod"" IR transmitter for typical installations.  If it is desired to control several theater devices that are separated by closed cabinets, an additional IR emitter may be used to reach all devices.  Blumoo has an additional port on the cable that, if desired, can accept a readily-available, standard 3.5mm IR emitter cable.  Since the IR transmitter is located inside the stationary Blumoo ""pod"", your phone becomes the remote control to your standard equipment without the 'line-of-sight' limitations that are typical with most remote controls.  
Audio from your mobile device is transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth to Blumoo.  The audio is transmitted to the receiver from Blumoo via standard 3.5mm jack or RCA connections.  
 
 What does the Blumoo app do?
The Blumoo app provides the remote control interface to your stereo equipment and quick access to your streaming and media app's.  To maintain an intuitive interface to the user, only relevant controls for the selected mode will be displayed.
If we can achieve our stretch goal, we will be able to create a full universal remote control app for iOS and Android to control all of your home entertainment equipment (TV, Blu-Ray, DVD Player, Receiver, Satellite, Cable Box, etc) - all from your single Blumoo hardware device!

The standard main screen of the iOS/Android app includes quick access to power on the stereo receiver, volume control, and auxiliary selection.
If you are on your streaming auxiliary, you can access your media libraries or streaming app's by tapping the music icon.
If you are on CD or Tuner, you'll get quick access controls relevant for those functions.
 
 
Expandability
Blumoo is a flexible hardware platform that can be used to control any device with an infrared remote control (TV, DVD & Blu Ray players, Satellite Box, Cable Box, Projectors, Soundbars, and much more) associated with it from your mobile device.  Following launch we will provide an open API with our comprehensive IR code database to enable developers at-large to modify, expand, and make new Blumoo app variants!  The database is extremely large so we won't be posting it on here, but feel free to contact us if you have any specific questions of what the database includes...if it has an IR interface and you want to control it, theres a good chance our database includes it.
How do you set up Blumoo?
We designed the Blumoo hardware and app entirely around simplicity.  The entire Blumoo experience - from set-up to daily use - revolves around ease of use for you.

 
Just a few simple steps to get your Blumoo installed:
1) Connect Blumoo audio output to your receiver or speaker system's input with standard RCA or 3.5mm connection.
2) Connect the included power cable to Blumoo and plug into a wall outlet.
3) Install the iOS or Android App on your mobile phone or tablet.  The setup wizard will walk you through installation.
4) Press the button on top of Blumoo to pair with your mobile device.
5) Select Manufacturer from drop down list.

Blumoo Models and Rewards:
We are offering the following Blumoo colors for our Indiegogo campaign.  The Brushed Aluminum version will be our trademark product that will be taken into market.  If you want to stand out from the crowd, we are offering the Black Chrome and the Royal Blue versions as Indiegogo exclusives and will only be available through this campaign.  



Show your support for Flyover Innovations with this unique t-shirt. Blumoo Bob on the front, Flyover Innovations logo on the back.

OUR STRETCH GOAL
If we can reach $40,000...
We have concentrated on stereo control for the included app because this is a such a common use case and yet no device exists on the market to provide both full control and streaming capability to your existing equipment from your mobile device.  BUT...Blumoo can control all of your home theater equipment.  If we are able to exceed our goal and reach $40,000 we will be able to create a full universal remote control app for all of your home theater equipment (tv, blu-ray, dvd, projector, satellite, cable box, etc) and send it to all donors that purchased any Blumoo package!!!
Included in the Blumoo Product Package:

Blumoo ""pod""
Blumoo app download (iOS or Android)
Audio cable with 3.5mm jack
Power cable and outlet connection
Blumoo setup guide
What will we do with Indiegogo funding?
We are a small startup company with big dreams - we need your help to realize these dreams!  With a successful campaign, we can bring Blumoo to market and get Flyover Innovations off the ground.
The funds raised from this Indiegogo campaign will enable us to take Blumoo into production.  We can begin cutting tooling for the composite parts and purchase components for the first build.

What stage of development is Blumoo in?
We have fully functional prototypes and are currently in the product testing phase.  Check out the ""Gallery"" tab to see videos of Blumoo in action.
Hardware: Initial design is complete for Blumoo, we are now in the process of testing the hardware and embedded software to ensure that Blumoo meets our quality and robustness standards.  
iOS and Android App: Blumoo app development is currently underway.  The app is currently functional, however, we are continuing efforts to refine it in order to ensure that we have a remote control interface that's intuitive and simple with the necessary features. 
Mechanical: Initial design is complete and undergoing testing and evaluation.  Ready to cut tooling!
Manufacturing and Supply Chain: We have already visited, audited, and established a partnership with a reputable manufacturing company.
Will the final product differ from the prototype shown in the video?
Blumoo ""Pod"" - The prototype Blumoo ""pod"" looks very similar to what it will look like in production.  However, there are two items that will be slightly different on production versions:

The Blumoo logo will be silkscreened on the lower front of the case
The production cable will have the power, 3.5mm audio, and 3.5mm optional IR extender jacks injection molded into a harness 

Blumoo ""App"" - The App will maintain a similar layout as shown in the demo.  There may be some slight modifications to the graphic symbols used and the page layout as we finalize the UI.  Updated screenshots will be provided if changes are made.
 
FAQ
As questions come in, we'll update them here:
1.  What version of Bluetooth is used on Blumoo?
We are using Bluetooth v4.0.  We use A2DP profile for stereo audio transfer and SPP for remote control transfer between Blumoo and your mobile device.
2.  What if I have both an Android and an iOS device in my house - can I get both app downloads with a purchased package?
Yes. The Blumoo apps will be readily available for free download.
3.  What control functions are built into the app? What devices can it control?
The standard app will be launched as a music controller - it will be capable of controlling your receiver/tuner, and CD player.  The controls that are displayed on the app are relevant for the auxiliary that is selected. For example, if you select ""tuner"" then the controls displayed would be Power, Volume Control, Tune Up/Down, and your Preset Station selections.  If you selected ""CD"" as the auxiliary, the controls would be Power, Volume Control, Skip Forward/Back, Pause, Stop, and Disk Change.  If you select an open Aux we will default to showing streaming media controls - receiver Power, Volume Control, access to your mobile devices stored music (itunes, android music player) and access to your streaming app's (Spotify, Pandora, Grooveshark, etc).  If we are able to achieve our stretch goal, we will create an app that will allow you to use Blumoo to control all of your home theater devices (TV, DVD player, Stereo, Cable Box, etc).  Suggestions for additions to the app?  Let us know!!
4.  Can I have more than one device connected to Blumoo at a time?
Yes. We are targeting the ability to have 5 devices connected to Blumoo at a time!  We don't like looking for remotes, so we don't want you searching for your phone either...pick up whatever mobile device is closest to you (phone, tablet, itouch) and start controlling/streaming!
5.  When the full universal app is created that is able to control all of my home theater equipment (TV, DVD Player, Stereo, Cable Box, etc), will I need to add more Blumoo's or will one device be able to control all of these?
As long as all of your devices are in relatively close proximity as they typically are in a standard living room or theater installation, a single Blumoo hardware device will be able to control all of these devices.  If you have a device that is outside of the proximity (e.g. in a closed cabinet that will be away from the Blumoo ""Pod"") you can simply plug in an IR extension dongle into the available port on the Blumoo ""Pod"" cable. 
6.  Is there a 'learning' function for the unit if my equipment is not in the database?
Yes. We have incorporated a ""learning"" mode into the Blumoo in the rare chance that your equipment or specific control command is not included in the database.  If you are curious if your equipment is covered in the database, shoot me a message and I'll check for you!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hi, my name’s Kennedy. I live in Vancouver, British Columbia. I have a genetic disease called Osteochondritis Dissecans. In most cases, it's little pieces of bone that break off in usually the knee or elbow of an active person when they've shocked their body. These pieces are usually so small that they either dissolve or reattach themselves. As well, they usually break off on the outside of a bone which a person usually can't feel. So in most cases, people aren’t even aware when they have Osteochondritis Dissecans. Unfortunately, I have a rare case due to the size and location of my dead bone. My most recent MRI and CT scans shows that there’s a 2.6 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm bone defect along the medial knee joint with at least 7 small fragments overlying the defect. </span><span>The fragments vary in size with the largest measuring 1 cm x 8 mm. As well, there’s swelling demonstrated in the suprapatellar bursa and in the medial gutter.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In 2001, I injured myself during a school field trip. I tore a ligament and my gastrocnemius muscle (attached to the achilles tendon). This is when my knee pain began. Prior to my injury, I was very active and loved to dance. Initially, when I complained about my knee pain my doctors didn't take me seriously so nothing was done. I was repeatedly told that I was experiencing growing pains. In 2005, I had to quit dancing and quit all other forms of physical activity (excluding short distance walking). In the fall of 2006, I had my first MRI and this is when Osteochondritis Dissecans was discovered in my knee. In 2007, I had my first failed surgery. My surgeon at the time drilled 3 holes into my knee hoping to create a blood flow and revive my cells. In 2008, I had my second failed surgery. The same surgeon drilled the same 3 holes as well as 2 more. His intent was to attach my dead bone to my healthy bone with 2 screws. However, he was unable to because my dead bone was very soft (like mush) and wouldn't hold the screws. Also, I've been left with very little healthy cartilage. My former surgeon called my cartilage ""shaggy"".  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Everyday I experience knee pain - some days are worse than others. Last January, I was on bed rest for a month due to excruciating pain. My dad came over from Victoria and brought me to Ossur (</span><a href=""http://www.ossur.com/?PageID=12521"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.ossur.com/?PageID=12521</span></a><span>). I’ve been wearing one of their unloader braces since February 2012.  I do notice a difference when I have it on so I wear it on a daily basis. However, I look at it as more of a band-aid and temporary help. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A few months ago, I was given the option to have more surgeries. This time they'd be much more invasive. </span><span>The surgeons want to do at least 3 surgeries, maybe more. During the first one they want to straighten my knee joint by putting a metal plate in the joint and cut a leg muscle of mine to reshape and tighten the ligaments of my knee. The second surgery will be to remove the dead bone fragments. The third surgery will be a tissue/bone graft borrowed from the tissue bank (deceased donors). The surgeons say they may have to do more than one graft and the total time of surgery and recovery is estimated at 2 years. They aren’t sure how successful all these surgeries will be which leads me with an uneasy feeling. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>My dad's been interested in stem cell research. The cost has always held us back though. Unfortunately, the stem cell procedures that I need aren't available in Canada, and aren't covered by the government. However, at this point I really can't wait any longer. I'm so very fortunate to have such a loving and supportive family. My dad’s helping me out as much as he can. As well, my mom would like to be able to help me out. She’s planning on selling her car for me. It's really not in my nature to ask for help but as much as I would love to solve my health problems I don't want to create new problems for my family.

<div>
<div>I'm hoping these procedures will eliminate my chronic pain and strengthen my knee. Before I had to completely stop all physical activity (excluding short distance walking), I was a dancer. I danced everyday and I loved it. It was a true passion of mine. I've been injured for so long, that it seems far fetched to me to think that I could ever dance again.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p dir=""ltr"">First of all, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to read my story. I know that many people who'd like to help can't afford to donate any money. There's plenty of other ways you can help though! It'd mean a lot to me if you shared my page with your family, friends and coworkers. Hopefully this will spread the word and help me reach my goal. Not only would it be a dream come true to live a life with no pain and no limitations. Also imperative that doctors, specialists, parents, phys ed teachers (etc) have more knowledge on this genetic disease. To this day, one of the most frustrating parts of my health struggles is that my doctors and phys ed teachers (even with a doctor's note) didn't take my knee pain seriously.</p>
<br/>From the bottom of my heart, thank you again for taking the time out of your day to read this!! ~Kennedy</div>

First of all, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to read my story. I know that many people who'd like to help can't afford to donate any money. There's plenty of other ways you can help though! It'd mean a lot to me if you shared my page with your family, friends and coworkers. Hopefully this will spread the word and help me reach my goal. Not only would it be a dream come true to live a life with no pain and no limitations. Also imperative that doctors, specialists, parents, phys ed teachers (etc) have more knowledge on this genetic disease. To this day, one of the most frustrating parts of my health struggles is that my doctors and phys ed teachers (even with a doctor's note) didn't take my knee pain seriously.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you again for taking the time out of your day to read this!! ~Kennedy",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi. We're Blue Infusion Technologies.<span>  </span>We are regular guys by day and tinkerers/inventors/entrepreneurs by night from various areas of Maryland. We have been working on a method to make it easier to control music while wearing gloves and active.

In exchange, we're offering some perks which we think you’ll like, including pre-orders and signature series gloves. Your contribution will help us manufacture and deliver BEARTek gloves to active people everywhere, and further, it will help support a home-grown idea turn into something big. Thanks!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<span class=""agText"">Hey Indiegogo. Thanks for checking out our campaign.  BEARTek gloves are smartly designed, electronically capable gloves intended to make it much easier to control music and phone calls while maintaining control, comfort, and safety in your activity.  With the help of our Electronic Bluetooth Module (EBM), BEARTek gloves use bluetooth technology to control your smart phone with ease using only the natural movements of touching your thumb to your fingertips.<br/><br/>BEARTek stands for:<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/>B</span>luetooth<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">E</span>nabled<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A</span>udio<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">R</span>egulation<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tech</span>nology<br/><br/><br/></span>
<h3>Who are we and where'd the glove idea come from?</h3>
<div>My name is Willie and I am an avid sportbike rider.  In my early years riding, I recognized a challenge that riders who wanted music typically faced.  Unless they wanted an expensive helmet-mounted solution, there weren't too many options available for them.  Friends I've talked to have similar problems on the slopes.  The idea dawned on me that there should be another way - a safer way - a less expensive way - a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">cooler</span> way - thus the idea was born... years ago.<br/><p>This idea of a glove which allows the user to control his music was pretty cool, I thought - but I hadn't acted on it.  After years of taking notes, keeping the idea in the back of my mind, and recognizing many of the other active people it would benefit, I HAD to see if this was something which could be created.  So late last year, I built a small team and got to work.</p>
</div>
<span class=""agText""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What can a BEARTek glove do?</span><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span>By touching your thumb to the appropriate finger, you will control your phone's ability to do the following and more:<br/></span>

<h3>What materials are BEARTek gloves made from?</h3>
<p>BEARTek gloves are made primarily from standard materials appropriate for the specific glove use.  ABS plastic is used to house the electronic components.  Other materials include genuine and synthetic leathers, suede, polyester, polyurethane, and conductive fabrics.</p>
<p>Our ski and motorcycle gloves are designed with materials for waterproofing, breathe-ability, comfort, and warmth.  The fingers are slightly pre-curved to reduce ""break-in"" time and enable easier grip on handle bars and ski poles.  On the motorcycle gloves we've added ventilation in-between the fingers and on the back of the hand for air-flow and cooling.  Ski gloves will come with tethering straps so they can be removed without risk of dropping and losing a glove.</p>
<p>Our gloves are made of high-quality materials for long-lasting comfort, protection, and durability.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cost model</h3>
<span class=""agText""><span class=""agText"">When designing the BEARTek glove, one of the challenges we'd faced when conceiving consumer value was expense and maintenance.  You can't wash electronics (usually) and they are not always inexpensive to replace when damaged.  Our solution - separate the glove from the electronics.  The EBM is a removable component which enables cleaning and maintenance of the glove without risk to the electronics.  That solves the maintenance problem... but what about expense?  The removability of the EBM immediately aids in the solution of cost.  The EBM and gloves are designed to be completely interchangable.  One EBM can be used on every type of glove we will offer.  So if you ride in the summer and ski in the winter, you only need a single EBM.  What's better is upgrade of the EBM will automatically mean all of your BEARTek gloves are enabled for the new capabilities.<br/><br/>High quality manufacturing isn't cheap, so the gloves aren't either.  Our cost model currently stands as follows.  Less complex gloves will cost considerably less.<br/>Motorcycle glove - $129<br/>Ski glove - $89<br/>Electronic Bluetooth Module - $139<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Only on Indiegogo - the cost is about $130 for a glove and module together, depending on your perk selection!</span><br/><br/><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Palm view:</span><br/><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/64325889@N04/5860061745/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""final front - features1 by beartek, on Flickr""><img alt=""final front - features1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5036/5860061745_e28c22ac5a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></span></span>

<p>To get there we need to create molds for the ABS plastics ($12,000), electronics for the Bluetooth module and the glove ($18,000 to reach minimum order), and the gloves themselves which have a minimum order quantity ($15,000), and a little room for the ever-present ""fudge-factor"".</p>
<p>I think we've put together some pretty cool perks around the donation model and hope you like them.  Additionally, we've made the price considerably lower than what the gloves and brain modules will be at retail.  All of this is with the hope that you'll take advantage of what we have and tell your friends, family, forums, and bloggers. </p>

Hi. We're Blue Infusion Technologies.  We are regular guys by day and tinkerers/inventors/entrepreneurs by night from various areas of Maryland. We have been working on a method to make it easier to control music while wearing gloves and active. Our current project is the BEARTek glove and we’re almost complete.  But we need your help.
We need to raise $47,000 to cover the cost of manufacturing fabrics, electronics, and plastics.  So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering some perks which we think you’ll like, including pre-orders and signature series gloves. Your contribution will help us manufacture and deliver BEARTek gloves to active people everywhere, and further, it will help support a home-grown idea turn into something big. Thanks!
What is a BEARTek glove?  
 
Hey Indiegogo. Thanks for checking out our campaign.  BEARTek gloves are smartly designed, electronically capable gloves intended to make it much easier to control music and phone calls while maintaining control, comfort, and safety in your activity.  With the help of our Electronic Bluetooth Module (EBM), BEARTek gloves use bluetooth technology to control your smart phone with ease using only the natural movements of touching your thumb to your fingertips.BEARTek stands for:BluetoothEnabledAudioRegulationTechnology
Who are we and where'd the glove idea come from?
My name is Willie and I am an avid sportbike rider.  In my early years riding, I recognized a challenge that riders who wanted music typically faced.  Unless they wanted an expensive helmet-mounted solution, there weren't too many options available for them.  Friends I've talked to have similar problems on the slopes.  The idea dawned on me that there should be another way - a safer way - a less expensive way - a cooler way - thus the idea was born... years ago.This idea of a glove which allows the user to control his music was pretty cool, I thought - but I hadn't acted on it.  After years of taking notes, keeping the idea in the back of my mind, and recognizing many of the other active people it would benefit, I HAD to see if this was something which could be created.  So late last year, I built a small team and got to work.

What can a BEARTek glove do?By touching your thumb to the appropriate finger, you will control your phone's ability to do the following and more:

Play
Pause
FastForward/Rewind
Next/previous track
Answer phone calls
Voice dial
Play Pandora/Slacker
Dial emergency number
more

Future modules will surely enable more features.Similar to the 'lock' feature on your phone or MP3 player, the sides of the index finger on BEARTek gloves allow you to eliminate accidental activation or deactivation of activity.BEARTek gloves are the perfect tool for Exceptional Mobile Audio ControlWho is it for?Anyone can use these gloves for their chosen activities - just a short list is below

<p><br/>David Ortega (psychologist, composer of popular children's game music, father and creator of SymbeeStars) was experiencing a frustrating problem that many parents deal with - nighttime routines that end with your child not ready to go to sleep. Nightlights helped a little, but they didn't do anything to soothe them gently to sleep. Then he thought about what he wished the lights in his child's room would do. He talked to his longtime friends technology inventor John Sosoka and artist David Rees, and his wonderful concept began to take shape in the real world - SymbeeStars.</p>

<h2>
<br/>What are SymbeeStars?</h2>
<p><br/>SymbeeStars are the nightlight of the future. They are battery operated, super low power lights that you can stick to any surface and control with your iPhone 4s, iPad3 or optional remote - with more Bluetooth 4.0 devices being added (Android is around the corner).</p>
<p>SymbeeStars have beautiful interchangeable shades and full color light capability. They are as much beautiful accenting light as anything else. They can be programmed to shift colors, pulse and glow, and fade out over time (perfect for your sleepless child). With the onboard audio sensor SymbeeStars also keep a log of your child's nightly waking activity (accessible on your mobile device).</p>

<h2>How SymbeeStars help you with your sleepless child</h2>
<p>As parents, we all know that repetitive, soothing stimuli help transition a child to sleep. SymbeeStars provide soft illumination that can follow a preset or user-definable pattern. These lights can slowly dim over time as your child nears sleep. Every aspect is customizable, such as the pattern you choose or the time frame for the dimming.</p>
<p>For toddlers and older children, Symbee Stars can be that comforting light but with a truly magical edge. Imagine falling to sleep as you watch a wash of blue/green watery glow travel from one sea creature to the next, then back again, like a gentle current of water. Want to save on some battery life? Have these dim as your child falls asleep, then softly turn on again if your child wakes. The on-board microphone is ready and listening for your child, and doesn’t waste battery life keeping the lights on all night.</p>
<p>&lt;Geek Alert!&gt;<br/>Humans are hard-wired to respond to patterns in nature. Think of a candle’s flame: long, fluid lines are interspersed with flickers and waves. Fluid dynamics are not random behavior either. Symbee Stars light patterns imitate these natural phenomenon because we know organic patterns that are a mid-point between order and randomness are preferred by humans. (Hagerhall, et al., 2008)</p>

<h2>I don't have a sleepless child - what else can I do with SymbeeStars?</h2>
<p>Don't have any young kids? Do you love beautiful lighting? Are you a gamer? musician? laserium fan? Like cool hi-tech stuff? Need an awesome party light? Want to add some hi-tech coolness to your dorm room? Then SymbeeStars are for YOU.</p>
<p>The possible applications of SymbeeStars are amazingly diverse.</p>
<p>Turn your house or garden into a beautiful space. You could use them for precisely controlled decorative lighting in your home, or fill your patio with fireflies to create a romantic space.</p>
<p><img alt=""SymbeeStars outdoors"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://symbeestars.com/images/Symbee/DinnerParty.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""SymbeeStars outdoors""/></p>
<p>Being able to control your lights from your iPhone means your lights can interact with any application that is Symbee enabled. Imagine SymbeeStars on your walls coming to life in response to the games and books your child experiences on the iPad. Enjoy mood lighting that customizes itself to the music you are listening to on your iphone or ambient simulations like sunsets and rain.</p>
<p>Why not have interactive spooky lights this Halloween or beautiful seasonal lighting for the Holidays? SymbeeStars will be your favorite decoration year round.</p>

<h2>
<br/>I don't have a smartphone. Can I still use these lights?</h2>
<p>Excellent question - Yes. Put in batteries, stick SymbeeStars to any wall (with the provided 3M command strips) and they work. A simple tap will turn them on and they will automatically fade out over time (to preserve battery life). Use our optional remote control to control brightness, pulsing patterns, colors and fade out options. Devices are already positioned to handle BlueTooth4.0, so sometime in the near future many more mobile devices will be able to control SymbeeStars.</p>

<h2>
<br/>These sound pretty complicated to set up. How do I get them working?</h2>

<h2>What is the Technology behind SymbeeStars?</h2>
<p>There are several technology advances behind SymbeeStars. Let’s start with the new wireless technology. While Bluetooth has been around for years, this year ushered in a whole new kind of Bluetooth, called ""Bluetooth Smart"". The new Bluetooth 4.0 that you are starting to hear about is really two Bluetooth systems in one package. All Bluetooth 4.0 devices, like the iPhone 4S are ""dual mode"" devices. They have all the regular Bluetooth features that we love but they also have an amazing ability to talk to very inexpensive, very low power devices. This ability will change our relationship with the physical world. Now we can connect your phone to a SymbeeStar or let your plants alert you on your phone that they’re thirsty. These Bluetooth Smart devices can run for a year with a small coin cell battery. Of course SymbeeStars are running bright LEDs so they need larger AA batteries to power the lights.</p>
<p>Another technology behind SymbeeStars is in the quality of the light. You’ve seen many products with colored (RGB) LEDs and they have a very cold bluish tint. SymbeeStars have and advanced RGBA LED system that provides a beautiful, warm color palette. If you would like more technical detaions just post a comment and we will respond.</p>

<hr/></div>","The story
David Ortega (psychologist, composer of popular children's game music, father and creator of SymbeeStars) was experiencing a frustrating problem that many parents deal with - nighttime routines that end with your child not ready to go to sleep. Nightlights helped a little, but they didn't do anything to soothe them gently to sleep. Then he thought about what he wished the lights in his child's room would do. He talked to his longtime friends technology inventor John Sosoka and artist David Rees, and his wonderful concept began to take shape in the real world - SymbeeStars.
Guy Kawasaki""Make your kid's room a magical place with these iOS controlled lights.""
Tech Cocktail""A bright innovation for intelligent consumer lighting systems.""
PadGadget:""Sometimes our iDevices are able to do truly impressive things...A team of creators, some of which are behind the robotic dinosaur Pleo and the Furby, have come together to design a new product called Symbee Stars.""

What are SymbeeStars?
SymbeeStars are the nightlight of the future. They are battery operated, super low power lights that you can stick to any surface and control with your iPhone 4s, iPad3 or optional remote - with more Bluetooth 4.0 devices being added (Android is around the corner).
SymbeeStars have beautiful interchangeable shades and full color light capability. They are as much beautiful accenting light as anything else. They can be programmed to shift colors, pulse and glow, and fade out over time (perfect for your sleepless child). With the onboard audio sensor SymbeeStars also keep a log of your child's nightly waking activity (accessible on your mobile device).

How SymbeeStars help you with your sleepless child
As parents, we all know that repetitive, soothing stimuli help transition a child to sleep. SymbeeStars provide soft illumination that can follow a preset or user-definable pattern. These lights can slowly dim over time as your child nears sleep. Every aspect is customizable, such as the pattern you choose or the time frame for the dimming.
For toddlers and older children, Symbee Stars can be that comforting light but with a truly magical edge. Imagine falling to sleep as you watch a wash of blue/green watery glow travel from one sea creature to the next, then back again, like a gentle current of water. Want to save on some battery life? Have these dim as your child falls asleep, then softly turn on again if your child wakes. The on-board microphone is ready and listening for your child, and doesn’t waste battery life keeping the lights on all night.
<Geek Alert!>Humans are hard-wired to respond to patterns in nature. Think of a candle’s flame: long, fluid lines are interspersed with flickers and waves. Fluid dynamics are not random behavior either. Symbee Stars light patterns imitate these natural phenomenon because we know organic patterns that are a mid-point between order and randomness are preferred by humans. (Hagerhall, et al., 2008)

I don't have a sleepless child - what else can I do with SymbeeStars?
Don't have any young kids? Do you love beautiful lighting? Are you a gamer? musician? laserium fan? Like cool hi-tech stuff? Need an awesome party light? Want to add some hi-tech coolness to your dorm room? Then SymbeeStars are for YOU.
The possible applications of SymbeeStars are amazingly diverse.
Turn your house or garden into a beautiful space. You could use them for precisely controlled decorative lighting in your home, or fill your patio with fireflies to create a romantic space.

Being able to control your lights from your iPhone means your lights can interact with any application that is Symbee enabled. Imagine SymbeeStars on your walls coming to life in response to the games and books your child experiences on the iPad. Enjoy mood lighting that customizes itself to the music you are listening to on your iphone or ambient simulations like sunsets and rain.
Why not have interactive spooky lights this Halloween or beautiful seasonal lighting for the Holidays? SymbeeStars will be your favorite decoration year round.

SymbeeStars are an exciting platform to develop on, and Symbeeco is enthusiastically dedicated to making the platform readily available to developers for a host of application possibilities.
Here is a partial list of some of the things that can be made possible with SymbeeStars iOS applications:
- Symbee lights react in response to room ambiance- SymbeeStars interac with click and explore apps- SymbeeStars to monitor sleep habits- SymbeeStars real time light shows in response to music from your iPhone or iPad- SymbeeStars color based image morphing- SymbeeStars lettering effects
SymbeeStars are a playground for developers!

I don't have a smartphone. Can I still use these lights?
Excellent question - Yes. Put in batteries, stick SymbeeStars to any wall (with the provided 3M command strips) and they work. A simple tap will turn them on and they will automatically fade out over time (to preserve battery life). Use our optional remote control to control brightness, pulsing patterns, colors and fade out options. Devices are already positioned to handle BlueTooth4.0, so sometime in the near future many more mobile devices will be able to control SymbeeStars.

These sound pretty complicated to set up. How do I get them working?
We put a lot of effort into making SymbeeStars zero effort for you! SymbeeStars work right out of the box. Download the app from the App Store, and you’re ready to go. If you don’t have (or don’t want to use) an iDevice, use the optional remote control. There are no IP addresses, no passwords, no configuration. It’s that easy.

</div>","Dear Backers and Friends! 
We’ve reached our initial goal ahead of the expected deadline, which means that we will launch the Smart Stand project even faster now. The Tablet Stand is now being sent to serial production, while the Phone Stand is on the mould production stage. 
Thank you all for your support and confidence.
We are looking forward to realizing new creative ideas together with you! Stay tuned!____________________________________________________________________________


Dear Friends,





Please welcome the Multi Purpose Stand. Our main goal and motivation is to bring you joy and pleasure from the presentation and possession of our new products.


The Multi Purpose Stand idea arose spontaneously, but its foundation relies on over 20 years of experience in creating such products. We highly appreciate your feedback and support!

Just like you,
we are passionate about new smartphone/tablet accessories and can’t resist the
temptation to buy and use them all: Wireless charger mats, mini projectors,
Bluetooth speakers, external batteries, and much more. But how to integrate them all and use their
capacities to the fullest? 

We looked high
and low for the solution on the market and found nothing original, not to
mention practical.






So we took the
courage to offer you a unique solution that is suitable for different tablet/phones sizes, has convenient magnetic fix and allows you to connect your phone with mini projector, external
speaker, external battery, built-in wireless charging and much more - please welcome Multi Purpose Stand!
It is convenient
to work with, pleasant to look at, and most importantly, it maximizes the joy of using various
accessories and gadgets together.


The project is
now in your hands. If you like it, please contribute to its realization and we
will know that our team hasn’t worked in vain. 



P.S. The stand
magnetizes money, thus brings it’s owner luck!

The only problem is now you have 2 or 3 different USB cables lying all around the house for all your USB devices.

<p>Each X-Connect Adapter features 2x N52 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. For all you oldies who still think magnets will affect your phones function, mobile phones use SSD (solid state drives) which aren't affected by small magnets like ours. In fact your phone itself has over half a dozen magnets inside it to power features such as your speakers. The magnets will also have no impact on your GPS functionality.</p>

<p>Another cool feature of X-Connect is that our magnetic tips will protect your phone port from dust and dirt.

<p>What sets X-Connect ahead of the competition is its unique bevelled and concave magnetic connector design on both ends of the tip and the adapter/cable. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Through this carefully engineered 360° exterior positioning of 2x N52 grade neodymium magnets on both ends, the tip only needs to be within 38mm (1.5"") of the magnetic field of the cable tip to be attracted and connect seamlessly. </span></p>
<p>Competitor designs require the tips to be correctly aligned with their opposite end to magnetically attract and connect. Competitor designs also feature weaker strength magnets and require a perfect alignment of both ends for a correct connection unlike X-Connect. <u>Not all magnetic cables are created equal</u>. Don't be fooled by the similar external look of competitor brands, X-Connect will connect seamlessly every time, even if the tip is flipped 180°, due to both the strong neodymium magnets having their polarity perfectly positioned and the unique outward and concave magnetic connector design.   </p>

<p>We have developed a replacement for the original Lightning tip for Apple devices to create the ""Alpha"" tip for 2 main reasons:</p>
<p><strong>REASON 1: </strong>If you've been through many Apple phone cables, you've experienced the tip wobbling and sometimes even breaking off. This occurs due to  the tip and base being made of 2 different components which eventually break apart over repeated use. Our Alpha tip solves this problem by integrating both the tip and base into 1 unified piece.</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/iSHnMYI.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><strong>REASON 2:</strong> To date Apple has not manufactured or released their own magnetic Lightning tips. This means if a company attempts to gain MFi (""Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad"") certification from Apple this won't be possible as they will</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> need to purchase the Lightning tips from an Apple MFi certified magnetic Lightning tip manufacturer which does not currently exist as of May 2017.</span></p>
<p>Without MFi certification many major retailers will not stock a USB lightning cable for Apple devices. The integration of the Alpha tip bypasses this issue process by not using the Lightning tip and allowing X-Connect to be sold in retailers worldwide. We've evolved from the original Alpha (for Apple) tip, to our unique black Alpha tips found exclusively on asap Technologies products.</p>

<details><summary>How do I choose my colour and connector type?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">You will be emailed a survey to your inbox via Backerkit at the end of the campaign within 14 days of the campaign ending.</p></details><details><summary>Can I choose a different asap X-Connect connector type and colour for each adapter/cable I order, even if I order them together as 1 perk?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes, you can choose a different connector type and colour for every adapter/cable purchased. For example if you purchase a TWIN PACK, you can choose 1 Apple and 1 Android adapter/cable in 2 different colours.</p></details><details><summary>How will my order be shipped?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">All orders will be shipping via courier with tracking, out of our fulfilment centre in Hong Kong and will be delivered in most cases by your local national postal service.</p></details><details><summary>Which countries do you ship to?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We ship to all countries excluding the following which have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria &amp; Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however we can't guarantee the shipment's arrival.</p></details> <details><summary>Your campaign seems similar to these other crowdfunding campaigns ""ZAPTIP"" and ""ZNAPS"" which both are way past their delivery date and also have poor communication with backers so we're very concerned that they are ""scams"" and this campaign is too. </summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">This question has been added as we feel it's important that we are 100% transparent about our project and to establish trust with our backers. We have during our last campaign (asap Connect) reports from the Indiegogo Trust and Safety Team in regards to concerns about these campaigns. Neither our product nor any member of our team is in any way associated with those 2 campaigns. Our technology is proprietary to asap Technologies and we have a utility patent-pending with patent filing number P103013.AU. This is our forth campaign on Indiegogo with the first 3 campaigns already delivered to customers.</p></details> <details><summary>So did your company actually invent the original magnetic USB technology?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">It is very important that all backers understand that this technology has been available in Asia since 2014. No company has claimed to have invented the original magnetic USB technology in the form of a patent so we will never truly know who originally invented it as magnetic power connection has been around for over 20 years and predates even the invention of ""Magsafe."" We can use the analogy of car brands to best explain this. Even though BMW, Ferrari or Lamborghini did not invent the original car, they each have their own unique engine, materials and design. Similarly, Asap Connect uses our own patent-pending magnetic technology with 18K gold plated connector design. We've solved significant issues found in the existing competitor designs and have created a more advanced technology for magnetic USB cables.</p></details> <h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #00abbe;"">FEATURES</h4>
<details><summary>What makes asap X-Connect better than other magnetic cables/adapters in the market?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">There are many features, though the most important is that we are the first to incorporate our patent-pending magnetic connector technology and as our magnets are positioned at the exterior of both the cable and connector tip it will always connect easily. We also have a fully functional cross-device compatible cable that works with all Apple and Android devices for both charging and data transfer.</p></details> <details><summary>Will the magnet interfere with the phones function? </summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">For all you oldies who still thinks magnets will affect your phones function, mobile phones use SSD (solid state drives) which aren't affected by small magnets like ours. In fact your phone itself has over half a dozen magnets inside it to power features such as your speakers.</p></details> <details><summary>How strong is the magnetic connection?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We've designed asap X-Connect V2.0 cables to be strongest magnetic cable on the market, strong enough to lift 400g and even lift an iPad Air. X-Connect adapter can hold 350g.</p></details> <details><summary>Is it easy to remove the tip from the phone?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">The tip will stay in place from any general daily use even if the phone is dropped, yet it can be easily removed with just your fingers when needed.</p></details> <details><summary>What is the length of the cable that comes with the cable set?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">The length of all asap X-Connect V2.0 cables is 1.5m (4.9ft).</p></details> <details><summary>Does asap X-Connect support data transfer for Apple and Android devices?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes, this also includes tethering.</p></details> <details><summary>Does asap X-Connect come with international warranty?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes, all asap X-Connect cables will come with an international 365 day warranty.</p></details>   <h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #00abbe;"">COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<details><summary>Is asap X-Connect backwards compatible with the original asap Connect cable?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">asap X-Connect is backwards compatible with the original asap Connect for micro USB and Type C. This campaign's adapters, cables and tips are fully compatible with all items in the X-Connect campaign.</p></details>  <details><summary>Is asap X-Connect adapter/cable compatible with all USB devices?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">asap X-Connect is compatible with all USB devices for charge and data sync. However it is not compatible with any audio functions such as your Lightning headphones, speakers or Apple Play.</p></details>  <details><summary>Will asap X-Connect affect the charging speed?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">asap X-Connect V2.0 cable will not alter any device's charging speed and can handle the maximum charging speed for mobile phones for the cable up to 5V/2.4Amps and for the adapter up to 12V/1.9Amps.</p></details>  <details><summary>Can I connect a Micro USB cable with an Alpha tip or vice versa?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes, asap X-Connect most unique function is that it is cross-device compatible. This means a cable designed for Apple will work with an micro USB tip and vice versa.</p></details>  <details><summary>Why have you not chosen to use the original lightning connector or have MFi certification? </summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Apple has not released a magnetic lightning connector, hence it is not possible to apply for MFi certification and by producing a lightning connector that is not MFi certified, it leaves that company open to legal action by Apple. Any company claiming to have a MFi magnetic connector is not possible as of May 2017. You can ask the company for a PPID number from Apple as proof. However the great news is our cables are made from a factory that produces MFi cables so the chip inside is identical and we have had no compatibility issues after 2 years of testing.</p></details>  <details><summary>Does asap X-Connect V2.0 cables support QC2.0 or QC3.0?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">asap X-Connect cables will support up to 5V/2.4Amps, which is more than most cables available, but it will not support the maximum speeds of Qualcomm Quick Charge technology due to the 2.4Amps limit. We have tested our cable with a QC3.0 charger and charge speeds are 8% slower from 0 - 50% battery power, and exactly the same speed from 50% - 100% battery power.</p></details>  <details><summary>Will the asap X-Connect adapter charge Type C devices at the full charge speed? </summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Currently our Type C adapters are limited to 12V/2.1A.

FLASH: World's Most Powerful 150W USB-C Powerbank
 

 



 

Our mission is to simplify the way you connect to your mobile devices. This is done by decluttering your life with 1 adapter that converts your existing USB cable into a magnetic end to use on all your mobile devices. Safe, simple and convenient, X-Connect will change the way you interact with your mobile devices forever. 
By becoming a backer of this campaign and choosing a reward, you will be pre-ordering one of our new X-Connect Adapters/cables. Aside from getting a huge special early backer discount, you'll also be one of the first in the world to own it.


We're a startup based in Sydney, Australia that is backed only by ourselves. We have no external investors. Instead we launch products through the magic of crowd funding. The funds raised here will not only go towards manufacturing, they will also help us to design future products.
If you have any questions please email hello@chargeasap.com and we will respond within 48 business hours.
 

 

We often overlook the impact of our mobile devices such as phones and tablets in our daily lives. We rely on our phones for just about every part of our day: from the alarm to wake up, to the GPS to get to work and avoid traffic, to checking emails to stay up to date with work to even social media to stay connected with our friends and loved ones.
Have you ever purchased a new phone and exclaim how life changing having a new phone is? How more convenient that Type C connector is so you don't have to fumble around in the dark? The way you interact with your phones and tablets is crucial to your daily productivity and happiness. The only problem is now you have 2 or 3 different USB cables lying all around the house for all your USB devices. This gets particularly annoying when you're travelling and need to bring a whole tangled mess of cables with you.

 

The X-Connect Adapter is safe, simple and conveniently connects to all your mobile devices.
1. Insert the tip into the port of your phone, which stays connected securely.
2. Attach the adapter to your existing USB cable
3. The X-Connect adapter will magnetically connect when placed near the tip
Now your 1 cable works for all modern Apple and Android devices!

 




Each X-Connect Adapter features 2x N52 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. For all you oldies who still think magnets will affect your phones function, mobile phones use SSD (solid state drives) which aren't affected by small magnets like ours. In fact your phone itself has over half a dozen magnets inside it to power features such as your speakers. The magnets will also have no impact on your GPS functionality.

The X-Connect adapter is strength tested to hold 350g whilst the cable can hold an impressive 400g . Enough with the technical blah blah, how strong is that in real life? Strong enough to hold an iPhone 7 Plus.

 

Through the use of our X-Connect adapters, the weak point of your cable which frays easily will be a worry of the past. Our magnetic technology will extend the life of your USB cables.

 


When we mean 1 cable for all your phones, we mean it. We've designed 3 magnetic connector tips to fit all 3 major connector types today for all mobile phones, tablets and USB devices.



 



The X-Connect Adapter features a reversible magnetic connection which means instant connection every single time. Simple and convenient isn't it? No more having to fumble around.

 


Another cool feature of X-Connect is that our magnetic tips will protect your phone port from dust and dirt. By leaving the tip inserted in your phone, it will also extend the life of your phone port by preventing the normal wear and tear of cables being inserted in and pulled out of your port on a regular basis.


 


What sets X-Connect ahead of the competition is its unique bevelled and concave magnetic connector design on both ends of the tip and the adapter/cable. Through this carefully engineered 360° exterior positioning of 2x N52 grade neodymium magnets on both ends, the tip only needs to be within 38mm (1.5"") of the magnetic field of the cable tip to be attracted and connect seamlessly. 
Competitor designs require the tips to be correctly aligned with their opposite end to magnetically attract and connect. Competitor designs also feature weaker strength magnets and require a perfect alignment of both ends for a correct connection unlike X-Connect. Not all magnetic cables are created equal. Don't be fooled by the similar external look of competitor brands, X-Connect will connect seamlessly every time, even if the tip is flipped 180°, due to both the strong neodymium magnets having their polarity perfectly positioned and the unique outward and concave magnetic connector design.   



We've tested our adapters and cables on dozens of Apple and Android phone and tablet devices with no compatibility issues. As long as you have any device that requires any of today's modern 3 device types: Lightning connector (Apple), micro USB connector (Android) or a Type C connector (Android) you'll be able to use X-Connect Adapter/cables with all of them.  
Please note: The adapter is not compatible with Type C to Type C cables due to its different pin configuration.
X-Connect's tip's are designed to fit a variety of major brand phone cases with ease. With our magnetic tip minimal footprint of only 10.5mm you can be comfortable knowing our tips will fit snug in your phone with your phone case. If you're unsure if this is the case, please email Customer Happiness Team on hello@chargeasap.com and we'll advise you if we have tested with that particular phone case and phone. 
  
 
The most popular compatibility question we received is if our cables are compatible with the Lifeproof Fre case for iPhone 6/6s/7/8. Here's a video showing you the tip and cable working seamlessly with the Lifeproof Fre case on.
 

 


Many of you technology buff's will be aware of Benson Leung the famous Google engineer which has called out many Type C cable brands for not being compliant to the new Type C standards that can damage your accessories and devices. Our Type C tips all feature the 56kΩ which prevents overdrawing of power from your power source to ensure safe use with your Type C devices.
The best feature of asap X-Connect is it's cross-device compatibility. This means you'll only need 1 cable for all phones and USB devices.
 


We've listened to feedback from thousands of backers from day 1, leading us to re-engineer our X-Connect cables to best suit your daily lifestyle. For those after a whole new cable, our upgraded X-Connect V2.0 cables are the world's fastest charging magnetic cables. We've also removed the LED light for those of you who have a love/hate relationship with it. 

The X-Connect V2.0 cable's magnetic strength is even stronger than the adapter, capable of holding 400g (oz). That's strong enough to hold an iPad Air!


No more tangled cables! With a cable tie that comes with every cable, your cable can be wrapped up and transported quickly and neatly every time.

 


Our X-Connect V2.0 cables continue to feature the reversible Type A. This is an evolution from the traditional Type A connector that are non-reversible. This means first connection every time, no more fiddling around to connect your cable! Check it out in action below.


 

All our cable cords are reinforced with braided nylon. They are so strong, they can even pull a 2040kg (4500lb) car!


 

Once the campaign finishes, you will be emailed a survey after 14 days, from BackerKit asking you to select your options, purchase upgrades, additional add-ons including tips, adapters, cables, cable sets and update your shipping address. Any new purchases from the BackerKit survey will not have an extra shipping charge and you will be offered the same discounted rate per add-on if you purchased a special or volume perk. If you have any questions after the survey has arrived please email hello@chargeasap.com.
If you choose an Apple adapter set, you will receive an adapter for an Apple (Lightning) cable + an Apple tip.
If you choose a Micro USB adapter set, you will receive an adapter for Micro USB cable + a Micro USB
If you choose Type C adapter set, you will receive an adapter for Type C cable + Type C tip





We have developed a replacement for the original Lightning tip for Apple devices to create the ""Alpha"" tip for 2 main reasons:
REASON 1: If you've been through many Apple phone cables, you've experienced the tip wobbling and sometimes even breaking off. This occurs due to  the tip and base being made of 2 different components which eventually break apart over repeated use. Our Alpha tip solves this problem by integrating both the tip and base into 1 unified piece.



REASON 2: To date Apple has not manufactured or released their own magnetic Lightning tips. This means if a company attempts to gain MFi (""Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad"") certification from Apple this won't be possible as they will need to purchase the Lightning tips from an Apple MFi certified magnetic Lightning tip manufacturer which does not currently exist as of May 2017.
Without MFi certification many major retailers will not stock a USB lightning cable for Apple devices. The integration of the Alpha tip bypasses this issue process by not using the Lightning tip and allowing X-Connect to be sold in retailers worldwide. We've evolved from the original Alpha (for Apple) tip, to our unique black Alpha tips found exclusively on asap Technologies products.

 

X-Connect has been granted the following international certifications to ensure safe use:

Our 3rd crowdfunding campaign asap X-Connect is the 2nd version of our magnetic USB cable which successfully raised over $378,828 since September 2016. You can find out more here.
Thank you to the entire crowd funding community for your support in bringing a consumer-driven technology startup to life. 




X-Connect has evolved from a simple idea of a magnetic cable to an everyday essential for mobile users all over the world. asap Technologies is still a start up that's been launched entirely with our personal savings which is why we need your help. You can support by backing the campaign and sharing it on social media. Every dollar will be reinvested back towards production and developing future products aimed at keeping you connected with your mobile devices as fast and convenient as possible.



We've Partnered up with Backerkit!


We've partnered up with Backerkit for a smooth, streamline experience for the fulfillment process. Once the campaign closes we will send you out a survey within 10 business days that will help us to review and break down your order into the specific items you ordered. This is also where you will be given the options to choose the colors, connector types and also purchase add-ons.



CAMPAIGN
How do I choose my colour and connector type?You will be emailed a survey to your inbox via Backerkit at the end of the campaign within 14 days of the campaign ending.Can I choose a different asap X-Connect connector type and colour for each adapter/cable I order, even if I order them together as 1 perk?Yes, you can choose a different connector type and colour for every adapter/cable purchased. For example if you purchase a TWIN PACK, you can choose 1 Apple and 1 Android adapter/cable in 2 different colours.How will my order be shipped?All orders will be shipping via courier with tracking, out of our fulfilment centre in Hong Kong and will be delivered in most cases by your local national postal service.Which countries do you ship to?We ship to all countries excluding the following which have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however we can't guarantee the shipment's arrival. Your campaign seems similar to these other crowdfunding campaigns ""ZAPTIP"" and ""ZNAPS"" which both are way past their delivery date and also have poor communication with backers so we're very concerned that they are ""scams"" and this campaign is too. This question has been added as we feel it's important that we are 100% transparent about our project and to establish trust with our backers. We have during our last campaign (asap Connect) reports from the Indiegogo Trust and Safety Team in regards to concerns about these campaigns. Neither our product nor any member of our team is in any way associated with those 2 campaigns. Our technology is proprietary to asap Technologies and we have a utility patent-pending with patent filing number P103013.AU. This is our forth campaign on Indiegogo with the first 3 campaigns already delivered to customers. So did your company actually invent the original magnetic USB technology?It is very important that all backers understand that this technology has been available in Asia since 2014. No company has claimed to have invented the original magnetic USB technology in the form of a patent so we will never truly know who originally invented it as magnetic power connection has been around for over 20 years and predates even the invention of ""Magsafe."" We can use the analogy of car brands to best explain this. Even though BMW, Ferrari or Lamborghini did not invent the original car, they each have their own unique engine, materials and design. Similarly, Asap Connect uses our own patent-pending magnetic technology with 18K gold plated connector design. We've solved significant issues found in the existing competitor designs and have created a more advanced technology for magnetic USB cables. FEATURES
What makes asap X-Connect better than other magnetic cables/adapters in the market?There are many features, though the most important is that we are the first to incorporate our patent-pending magnetic connector technology and as our magnets are positioned at the exterior of both the cable and connector tip it will always connect easily. We also have a fully functional cross-device compatible cable that works with all Apple and Android devices for both charging and data transfer. Will the magnet interfere with the phones function? For all you oldies who still thinks magnets will affect your phones function, mobile phones use SSD (solid state drives) which aren't affected by small magnets like ours. In fact your phone itself has over half a dozen magnets inside it to power features such as your speakers. How strong is the magnetic connection?We've designed asap X-Connect V2.0 cables to be strongest magnetic cable on the market, strong enough to lift 400g and even lift an iPad Air. X-Connect adapter can hold 350g. Is it easy to remove the tip from the phone?The tip will stay in place from any general daily use even if the phone is dropped, yet it can be easily removed with just your fingers when needed. What is the length of the cable that comes with the cable set?The length of all asap X-Connect V2.0 cables is 1.5m (4.9ft). Does asap X-Connect support data transfer for Apple and Android devices?Yes, this also includes tethering. Does asap X-Connect come with international warranty?Yes, all asap X-Connect cables will come with an international 365 day warranty.   COMPATIBILITY
Is asap X-Connect backwards compatible with the original asap Connect cable?asap X-Connect is backwards compatible with the original asap Connect for micro USB and Type C. This campaign's adapters, cables and tips are fully compatible with all items in the X-Connect campaign.  Is asap X-Connect adapter/cable compatible with all USB devices?asap X-Connect is compatible with all USB devices for charge and data sync. However it is not compatible with any audio functions such as your Lightning headphones, speakers or Apple Play.  Will asap X-Connect affect the charging speed?asap X-Connect V2.0 cable will not alter any device's charging speed and can handle the maximum charging speed for mobile phones for the cable up to 5V/2.4Amps and for the adapter up to 12V/1.9Amps.  Can I connect a Micro USB cable with an Alpha tip or vice versa?Yes, asap X-Connect most unique function is that it is cross-device compatible. This means a cable designed for Apple will work with an micro USB tip and vice versa.  Why have you not chosen to use the original lightning connector or have MFi certification? Apple has not released a magnetic lightning connector, hence it is not possible to apply for MFi certification and by producing a lightning connector that is not MFi certified, it leaves that company open to legal action by Apple. Any company claiming to have a MFi magnetic connector is not possible as of May 2017. You can ask the company for a PPID number from Apple as proof. However the great news is our cables are made from a factory that produces MFi cables so the chip inside is identical and we have had no compatibility issues after 2 years of testing.  Does asap X-Connect V2.0 cables support QC2.0 or QC3.0?asap X-Connect cables will support up to 5V/2.4Amps, which is more than most cables available, but it will not support the maximum speeds of Qualcomm Quick Charge technology due to the 2.4Amps limit. We have tested our cable with a QC3.0 charger and charge speeds are 8% slower from 0 - 50% battery power, and exactly the same speed from 50% - 100% battery power.  Will the asap X-Connect adapter charge Type C devices at the full charge speed? Currently our Type C adapters are limited to 12V/2.1A. Charging from a Type C to Type C cable has a different pin configuration and is not currently compatible with our adapters.  
Will the asap X-Connect cable charge Type C devices at the full charge speed?Currently our Type C cables are limited to the Type A maximum limit of 5V/2.4A. Charging from a Type C to Type C cable is designed to have a higher voltage and current which will be made available in our new MagX cable launching December 2017.   
REFUND POLICY

RETURN AND EXCHANGE POLICY
 
Please note all sales are final. Indiegogo is not able to guarantee that perks will be delivered or deemed satisfactory. The nature of crowdfunding is such that campaigns on Indiegogo are raising funds for work-in-progress projects, ideas, or causes. Contributing to a campaign and claiming a perk on Indiegogo is not the same as buying a product online. Whilst your contribution brings the campaign idea closer to becoming reality, there's always the chance that a project may end up falling through, and the campaign owner may not be able to offer their contributors the perks they'd originally advertised.
 
There will be no exchanges or returns for change of mind. In the event your product becomes faulty, please email us hello@chargeasap.com with a description of the issue. Once we assess the issue and are able to determine its a product fault, you'll be able to pay the $7USD reshipping fee for the product(s). We'll then dispatch your replacement order straight away. Please note that if an item has been discontinued, we are no longer able to provide warranty on that item. 
SHIPPING POLICY
 
If our shipping provider attempts to deliver to your address and the package is returned because of any of these reasons, there will be a reshipping fee: no-one is available to receive the package, the location is not accessible, you've provided the wrong address or you have moved without notifying us before the delivery dispatch.
 
If you have any questions please email the Customer Happiness Team on hello@chargeasap.com and we will respond within 48 business hours.",53.0,1,"10 Campaigns

<p>Smart devices are great. They make our lives more convenient and certainly more productive. Yet, they have always come with quite a number of accessories, which individually provide solutions such as charging battery, standing up your phone for the perfect viewing angle, storing and syncing data…etc. However, many of them are bulky and easy to forget.</p>
<p>Our quest was simple: </p>
<p><b>We believe it's time to re-think a better way to carry those “solutions” with us</b>. </p>
<p>Multiple solutions in 1 design? It just NOT ENOUGH!

The result was a small and lightweight 8-in-1 product that you will love. <b>WonderCube is reliable and useful in every situation.</b></p>

<p>We spent the first 2 and half months examining how people use and carry smart accessories.

</div></div>","BeeStylus – The world's first NFC Enabled Stylus and not just for writing !! Have you ever been in this situation?
You’re walking down a busy street or around your home talking to someone on the
phone and he suddenly gives you phone number or address.  While the person on the other end of the phone
waits, you frantically search for a pen and paper but to no avail.  If you tried to open your note APP in smartphone, that you have to do at least 3 steps to launch it.Well we’ve figured out an ingenious way
that utilizes NFC technology to solve this and other problems. Introducing the BeeStylus, an innovative and uniquely

you can use the BeeStylus to launch
any app by simply contacting the stylus with your phone or tablet. We call this
feature BlinkStwitch. This feature lets you switch between apps or open
two apps effortlessly, making multitasking that much easier. Some example scenarios

What’s more the tip, offered in a variety of colors, replicates the experience of using a marker pen.Innovative Pen Tips – Precise, sharp and colorful

To create a stylus like no other, through trial and error, we have finally come up with colorful tips as smooth and sensitive as black tips.The touch sensitivity of the stylus relies on the size of the pen tip. We have exceeded the technological standard by making the tip as delicate as 5.3 mm, offering a more precise and smooth writing and drawing experience.Replaceable tip design – Fit your lifestyle

<p>Folkz support multiple languages (around 90 of them), Location based services etc.. And also Active Sync with Legacy Applications and Software and allow interactive communication with users and applications.</p>
<p>Folkz have already signed up Network Partnerships for terminating messages over around 900 mobile networks across the globe. </p>

<h3> What we look for?</h3>
<p>Currently Folkz Core Modules have been deployed live and currently undergoing Beta tests at couple of partner locations. The remaining tasks involved are adding few of the special services identified (asked for as well) by couple of our Enterprise clients and few add on features for personal use. We need resources for further development work and for building the sales vertical. We expect to invest the major chunk of funding for buying carrier termination inventory to facilitate the user sign ups. Assuming the best scenario of one text message per new sign up even requires USD 20000/million messaging credits on an average. Our estimates are to keep inventory for around 10 million messaging credits..</p>
<p>Considering the wide acceptance and the user base of few other Apps in this segment, Folkz with its unique features can expect even bigger and wider acceptance. However this requires inventory for facilitating user sign ups. On the other hand at a later stage our Enterprise partners can leverage the user base for a significant cost advantage.</p>
<p>Folkz being a start up project, we look forward to raise sufficient funds to invest against the inventory requirements. Even though the project may be able to attract venture investments etc, we believe that it is too early to consider such options, as the priority being demonstrating the strength of the project and building up momentum and create a sizable user base. We consider, ensuring that we have sufficient funds to support the initial  push will help us to concentrate more on finishing the project and deploying it with value added features. Hence we think a crowd funding community can assist us in a big way.</p>
<p> We primarily expect the Indiegogo Crowd Funding community's assistance in: </p>
<ul>
<li>Organising capital for our expenses on inventory for the initial five to six months. (Later off course we are confident about generating cash flow from our Enterprise services)</li>
<li>Spread a word about Folkz and join us as a user of Folkz Free Services. The Folkz download link will be shared with all Indiegogo Contributors from 20th November 2013 onwards.</li>
<li>Give us valuable guidance and feedback about adding more and more Special Services on to the Platform</li>
</ul>
<p>We realise the strength of Indiegogo platform to assist a Good project in terms of branding, visibility etc. apart from providing funding support. Also we acknowledge that the collective strength of its community in terms of insights and inputs for enhancing the Project Scope and business strategy would be an immense value add to Folkz team.</p>
<p>We at Folkz expect momentum to pick up for the sales effort and spread a word about this exciting service among the community as well along with this campaign.</p>
<p>Also short messaging as one of the primary services a mobile phone facilitates and almost all subscribers uses, offering the same as a free service will greatly benefit individual /personal uses for texting. On the other hand enterprises also can befit significantly on Folkz platform with demonstrable  cost saving and unique features in offer which are not offered by any other service as at present.</p>
<h4>What if we do not achieve the goal?</h4>
<p>Well, That will be a tad disappointing; But still we will go ahead. As we are proposing a flexible campaign whatever we are receiving will help us to continue with the work. Only consequence we are seeing is we will have to grow at a lesser pace. But as we look at it, still we can go ahead and the time we need to achieve the scale will be extended a bit.</p>
<h4>What if we exceed the funding goal?</h4>
<p>An excess funding will be a great encouragement and will demonstrate the faith in the project. We will be working with more focus and determination to make Folkz the best communication platform for mobiles. Any excess amount could help further strengthen the resolve and achieve economies of scale. With mobile customer base of approximately 7 billion globally and still growing, messaging is one service will ever increase in volume. Since messaging is one of the primary service which every one uses, the sample size of the target customers is quite huge and we identify the inventory requirement as one of the major basic requirement going forward. </p>
<p>Hence every additional penny contributed will help us to further derive volume pricing and also can be deployed with increased focus on new user sign ups.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the application to person (A2P) messaging is poised for a business worth approximately 70 Billion USD annually by 2016 as per latest Research by Juniper. Folkz is being positioned to become one of the dominant players in the industry with its unique approach and features in offer. Hence in a way investment in user sign ups will complement our efforts to lower pricing for the Enterprise customers. Even a very modest 0.5% share of the Global market  of the A2P messaging will itself make Folkz a sizable business..</p>
<h4>Our Promise</h4>
<ul>
<li>Folkz will remain as a free service for basic App to App messaging and communication requirements of its members. Only exception will be when we need to terminate through a carrier network. However with our experience in A2P messaging industry we promise that still we have a cost advantage with Folkz. We believe that maintaining a free unlimited life long messaging platform for Smartphone users is a worthwhile contribution by itself.</li>
<li>Perks as detailed below strictly in line with time schedules indicated</li>
<li>A very judicious use of your contributions. Folks team believe that best way of expressing gratitude is by keeping up our words and delivering on the responsibility with accuracy and precision.</li>
</ul>

We at Folkz expect momentum to pick up for the sales effort and spread a word about this exciting service among the community as well along with this campaign.
Also short messaging as one of the primary services a mobile phone facilitates and almost all subscribers uses, offering the same as a free service will greatly benefit individual /personal uses for texting. On the other hand enterprises also can befit significantly on Folkz platform with demonstrable  cost saving and unique features in offer which are not offered by any other service as at present.
What if we do not achieve the goal?
Well, That will be a tad disappointing; But still we will go ahead. As we are proposing a flexible campaign whatever we are receiving will help us to continue with the work. Only consequence we are seeing is we will have to grow at a lesser pace. But as we look at it, still we can go ahead and the time we need to achieve the scale will be extended a bit.
What if we exceed the funding goal?
An excess funding will be a great encouragement and will demonstrate the faith in the project. We will be working with more focus and determination to make Folkz the best communication platform for mobiles. Any excess amount could help further strengthen the resolve and achieve economies of scale. With mobile customer base of approximately 7 billion globally and still growing, messaging is one service will ever increase in volume. Since messaging is one of the primary service which every one uses, the sample size of the target customers is quite huge and we identify the inventory requirement as one of the major basic requirement going forward. 
Hence every additional penny contributed will help us to further derive volume pricing and also can be deployed with increased focus on new user sign ups.
As a matter of fact the application to person (A2P) messaging is poised for a business worth approximately 70 Billion USD annually by 2016 as per latest Research by Juniper. Folkz is being positioned to become one of the dominant players in the industry with its unique approach and features in offer. Hence in a way investment in user sign ups will complement our efforts to lower pricing for the Enterprise customers. Even a very modest 0.5% share of the Global market  of the A2P messaging will itself make Folkz a sizable business..
Our Promise

Folkz will remain as a free service for basic App to App messaging and communication requirements of its members. Only exception will be when we need to terminate through a carrier network. However with our experience in A2P messaging industry we promise that still we have a cost advantage with Folkz. We believe that maintaining a free unlimited life long messaging platform for Smartphone users is a worthwhile contribution by itself.

<p>Its going to take a leap of faith from you that we can make this product real! I am asking for $5,000 to start the manufacturing costs which I foresee to cost around $1.96 per unit which at $5,000 will yield about 9800 units and with packaging costs. </p>
<p>There is also the need to get the funds for an injection mold. which will cost me any where from $20K. This injection mold will be the base for manufacturing the amount of units I'll need for a large scale operation. I know i'm only asking for $5,000 now but I have faith we can hit $25,000!!!</p>
<p><b>Manufacturing the iHang</b></p>
<p>My plans for when I have this project fully funded is to work with a partner i've found that is going to help me price out and tool an injection mold, once I have that, im going to take this product to trade shows across the country to find retailers to write me a purchase order. Once I have  a purchase order  in my hand I'll take that money to my manufacturer which Ive found in China to produce the amount of units needed by my retailer. I have done most the leg work for the manufacturer. I have the CAD drawings and renderings (as seen below) done, as well as the 3D printed model.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are now in our 5th year of business, so we are very confident in our manufacturing and shipping processes.<br/>However, there are always risks and challenges with the production of anything. There can be delays at the manufacturing facilities if the factory falls behind schedule, or shipping time tables can be delayed due to weather, equipment, carriers or simply human error. Exporting product over any holiday season can also add unforeseen delays and there is always the risk that items make it all the way to it's destination and they get held up in customs for some unknown reason!<br/>Please understand that a more advanced product than initially planned might postpone deliveries. These additionals may also have an influence on the final size and weight of the product.<br/>No matter what uncertains there may be, we are always here to slove for our customer and stand behind ZeroLemon.

</h3>In
today's modern and hectic life, the need become bigger and wider than ever to
save time and be able to spend our requirements rapidly and professionally.
Mobile phones are became an inseparable part in this, in fact we use it all
time, in all ways; whether for work, business or for communicating socially.
Also, we can ask for help or avoid danger by using our cellular. But, in such
these cases, how many people (if it were not one of you), have experienced a
situation where the battery gave out or died when you necessarily in need for
it badly, indeed you will become frustrated and disappointed. This drama
happened with me several times a week, even during a conversation with an
important client, as it occurred last time. Although, a spare power bank found
in my bag, like many people did, still was no time to pull it out, find a cable
to connect it to my phone because it was already off for a while. For these
reasons and many others, I start thinkingseriously to create something more
convenient and more effective. An external battery, which will be always handy,
with no cable needed and immediately useful. That moment 'Quickie' was born.<div style=""text-align: justify;"">

</div></div>","Born of the Quickie
In
today's modern and hectic life, the need become bigger and wider than ever to
save time and be able to spend our requirements rapidly and professionally.
Mobile phones are became an inseparable part in this, in fact we use it all
time, in all ways; whether for work, business or for communicating socially.
Also, we can ask for help or avoid danger by using our cellular. But, in such
these cases, how many people (if it were not one of you), have experienced a
situation where the battery gave out or died when you necessarily in need for
it badly, indeed you will become frustrated and disappointed. This drama
happened with me several times a week, even during a conversation with an
important client, as it occurred last time. Although, a spare power bank found
in my bag, like many people did, still was no time to pull it out, find a cable
to connect it to my phone because it was already off for a while. For these
reasons and many others, I start thinkingseriously to create something more
convenient and more effective. An external battery, which will be always handy,
with no cable needed and immediately useful. That moment 'Quickie' was born.

One of the 1st sketches

fig. 2: One of the first sketches I created.

I
listed above an illustrated sketches from family and friends. They have
supported my idea. So, with all that encouragement, and finally I decided to
briefs my friend who is an electronic engineer to my idea. He confirmed that
the idea is feasible, also he start helping me to develop my first prototype.





Now let Quickie tells you things about himself…




Quickie gives you an extended battery life whenever and wherever you need
it, while travelling by roads for many hours, relaxing on the beach, in which
case you are in, you will prepared for those long hours of using power.
Quickie Will Be Available In two
versions:
Quickie (with lightning) -  For iPhone 5, 5s, 6, 6 plus
Quickie (with microUSB) -  For Android & Windows Phone Device


Quickie will be loaded with an electrical energy; which enable you to recharge your phone anywhere and anytime, making your outdoor activities and travels more flexible and more easy. As a result, you will never lose the option to retain pleasant moments forever any more.



One of this project goals is reducing the charger size as small as
possible. Quickie is designed in small and tiny shape that can be fitted into
the slimmest pockets. Your feeling will be that you carry nothing while you
handle it. That goal is already achieved.



Quickie guaranteed an immediate protection for your mobile phone's
battery from completely discharge. Quickie designed to be always ready and

QUICKIE TEAM VISITED AMPER EXPO
INTERNATIONAL TRADE FAIR OF ELECTRONICS & ELECTROTECHNICS

Brno, Czech Republic – An International fair trade takes place at Brno exhibition centre during the last week. Quickie Team was there. We used this event to get more response from the professional and lay public. We presented the Quickie many people as we could. We got very value and positive response, what convinced us of the correctness of our previous decisions.



However, our main reason for visiting this exhibition was more important for us – We were find a reliable and competent business partner, which will supply parts for final manufacturing. We were to discuss the cooperation with exhibiting companies from around the world. We have received several offers from different companies. We are in negotiating phase with these companies to get the best deals price at high technologically level.

The reasons are two fold:</p><ul>
<li>Firstly, our know-how of the technology and the ecosystem. We as a team collectively have more than 90 years of industry experience in the electronics, battery and power management area. Our key members have worked with every major OEM and consortia playing a key role in commercializing wireless power as we know today</li>
<li>Secondly, it aligns perfectly well with our vision of creating valued added mobile devices brand. In the area of wireless power we aim to bridge the technology gap and create differentiated solutions for the marketplace that enables consumers to leverage the benefits right away rather than waiting for the technology to evolve.</li>
</ul><p><b>Conceptualizing TANGO</b></p><p>After deciding to build a product in the wireless power space, we tried multiple industrial designs using existing one coil and 3 coil solutions. But as a team, we were not happy with the overall user experience. We wanted to take our system a bit further and develop a product that pushes the boundaries and gives us an edge over everything else out there. We set ourselves three goals:</p><ul>
<li>A position-free transmitter that allows the user to place the phone anywhere on the pad </li>
<li>Ability to charge multiple devices at a time – we finally decided to support two devices to ensure optimal system cost vs market adoption</li>
<li>Most importantly, our system should work with all Qi devices – we picked Qi since it has widest adoption so far.</li>

None of them have been in production. We wanted to ensure we didn't fall in that category.</p><p>Based on our experience we knew that we had to build a multi coil system to provide a wide charge area. We knew it had to be more coils than just 3 to ensure a large charging area. After countless hours of experimenting across multiple magnetics designs, system configurations and algorithms, we finally developed our patent pending magnetics and software algorithm and the APF system was born.</p><p><b>APF System PCB and Magnetics Stack</b></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453156650/wv19ijimeggkgtqxvxwb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

    Convenience at its bestCharge your phone anywhere on the pad. No more looking for a sweet spot! 
World's First Multi-Device Wireless Charger 
Charge two devices simultaneously - Our patent pending Adaptive Position-Free system enables seamless charging of multiple devices Works with all Qi compliant devicesEvery phone that integrates wireless charging today is Qi complaint. Qi guarantees future proof designs. Tango will always work with Qi compliant phones even when new enhancements to Qi specification are introduced.  BackgroundWe started PowerSquare with a vision of creating a value added consumer devices brand for mobile power management that enhances usability for consumersAmong the many mobile accessories, we identified wireless power as one of the key focus areas in our roadmap. The reasons are two fold:
Firstly, our know-how of the technology and the ecosystem. We as a team collectively have more than 90 years of industry experience in the electronics, battery and power management area. Our key members have worked with every major OEM and consortia playing a key role in commercializing wireless power as we know today
Secondly, it aligns perfectly well with our vision of creating valued added mobile devices brand. In the area of wireless power we aim to bridge the technology gap and create differentiated solutions for the marketplace that enables consumers to leverage the benefits right away rather than waiting for the technology to evolve.
Conceptualizing TANGOAfter deciding to build a product in the wireless power space, we tried multiple industrial designs using existing one coil and 3 coil solutions. But as a team, we were not happy with the overall user experience. We wanted to take our system a bit further and develop a product that pushes the boundaries and gives us an edge over everything else out there. We set ourselves three goals:
A position-free transmitter that allows the user to place the phone anywhere on the pad 
Ability to charge multiple devices at a time – we finally decided to support two devices to ensure optimal system cost vs market adoption
Most importantly, our system should work with all Qi devices – we picked Qi since it has widest adoption so far.
  The Adaptive Position-Free System (APF)There are many demos out in the market that show multi-device charging. None of them have been in production. We wanted to ensure we didn't fall in that category.Based on our experience we knew that we had to build a multi coil system to provide a wide charge area. We knew it had to be more coils than just 3 to ensure a large charging area. After countless hours of experimenting across multiple magnetics designs, system configurations and algorithms, we finally developed our patent pending magnetics and software algorithm and the APF system was born.APF System PCB and Magnetics Stack

Evolution of the APF system APF System EvaluationSystem testing - We tested and validated multiple configurations and test scenarios until we were satisfied with the performance.Here is REV 0..It didn't have a name...we had to hide the electronics in a box. :-) Rev 2 Electronics The WAR Board - oh boy, all those late nights, pizzas and nightmares...the team doesn't want to wipe this board...ever :-) so with your help we may retire it on to a wall in the office :-) Compatibility with Qi DevicesAs this was our top priority, we ensured all experiments and developments were based on Qi protocol. The Tango pad works with any current or future device that is built to be Qi compliant.There are multiple use cases:1. Phones with built-in Qi functionality: With these phones you just have to place them on the Tango pad to start charging.
2. Phones available with Back covers: The phone is manufactured with back covers which have wireless charging receiver circuit embedded into them. Most of these compatible sleeves are available on Amazon 3. All other phones: There are many wireless power receiver adaptors available on amazon that will add wireless power capability to your phone. We are offering a version that should work with most phones android/windows as part of the Android/Windows Starter Combo pledge.Universal Micro USB Wireless Receiver for Android/Windows phones Add wireless power capability to your phone\ 4. iPhones: Dedicated iPhone cases are available on Amazon that add Qi functionality to the phone. We are offering a iPhone case as part of the pledges. iPhone case is now compatible with 6, 6S, 6 Plus and 6S Plus. Sorry we don't have 5S versions at this time. Our iPhone case also includes a micro USB connector so you can charge with a cable without removing the case. We understand that some people love the extra micro USB connector and some don't. There are other options available on Amazon that will fit your need.Note: We always recommend using Apple approved accessoriesApple approved iPhone Case now compatible with iPhone 6, 6S, 6 Plus and 6S Plus - An Indiegogo Exclusive discounted price!

 Using Tango with iPhone Sleeve   Having done extensive testing on the APF system, we decided on the X and Y size of the Tango pad to provide optimal combination of look, feel, portability and performance. Once we had the size locked in, we evaluated 100s of designs and zeroed in on the final design. Images below show Tango's progress from humble beginnings to its final form.Pencil sketches of various designs 3D Modelling and PrototypingAfter various iterations of modeling and prototyping, we finalized the two piece top design. We build various prototypes to ensure the overall structure was light weight and sturdy at the same time. Fine-tuning the Design and ToolingThis was lot more difficult than we expected. One key aspect we looked at was that we didn't want Tango to look like just another geeky device. Lot of our feedback was to make the product look good on a side table at home. We decided on the two piece top cover design that would enable us to cater to many color variations down the road.We have received lots of kudos for the color and design. So proud of the young team to make this happen.Move from single piece top cover to two piece giving us a lot of flexibility on color variations down the road We evaluated the entire system at each stage. We added these spacers to increase the air gap between the coils and top plate that helped in thermal management 3D model of the final plastics    The AdaptorOur adaptor comes with the following interchangeable plugs. All shipments will include this adaptor except for Early Bird USA shipments which will include a USA only plug. Image below shows end connector dimensions of the adaptor
 Where are we today?We have shipped a small set a units to customers and reviewers and have received great reviews. We have a strong supply chain in place to support production runs. Our manufacturing partners have years of experience in developing wireless power solutions that will ensure Tango is manufactured with utmost care and precision. TimelineWhy Indiegogo?Indiegogo is a vibrant and wonderful community that we would love to be part of.

<p>During our first campaign, our backers’ generous support helped us raise enough funds to launch iblazr’s production and ultimately bring this wireless flash to a wide audience. Our first backers—all 2,633 of them!—became the first among many to own iblazr. Now, Instagrammers, party people, techno geeks, photographers, cinematographers, professional journalists and so many others use iblazr flashes every day to take photos, shoot video and lighten their daily lives. ￼</p>
<p>Since launching iblazr, more than 20,000 users in 195 countries snapped over 150,000 photos with the help of our flash. iblazr is currently available in more than 45 countries, in hundred of shops, including Apple Stores and Best Buy, and online. Today every iblazr user is an essential part of our team, project and history.</p>

<p>iblazr 2, the second generation in the iblazr flash series, is the most advanced light source for smartphones and tablets available in the consumer market. This flash designed for smartphones also comes in handy when taking photos with tablets or DSLR cameras, lighting analogue photography, brightening nighttime video calls, or simply functioning as a small but powerful flashlight. </p>
<p>In creating iblazr 2, we not only optimized the physical design of the device but also made significant improvements to its electronic components. The result is an iblazr with more functions that remains as easy to use as it was before.</p>

<p>iblazr 2 is the only flash that works with native camera apps on your iPhone, iPad and Android smartphones!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>You simply use Bluetooth to connect iblazr 2 to your smartphone, then launch the native camera app. By tapping the iblazr device twice, it will beam a powerful 300 LUX on 1m flash synchronically with your camera’s shutter! That's absolutely magical.</p>

<p>We added a touch sensor to iblazr 2 for a more comfortable and intuitive user experience. This sensor lets you adjust the light color temperature from 3200K to 5600K to help you take better photographs in every situation. Want to get up close for a fancy portrait? Choose your warm light setting. Need a powerful cold flash, instead? Change the setting to 5600K mode. This flexibility will allow you to shoot photos that look more natural, professional and creative.</p>

During our first campaign, our backers’ generous support helped us raise enough funds to launch iblazr’s production and ultimately bring this wireless flash to a wide audience. Our first backers—all 2,633 of them!—became the first among many to own iblazr. Now, Instagrammers, party people, techno geeks, photographers, cinematographers, professional journalists and so many others use iblazr flashes every day to take photos, shoot video and lighten their daily lives. ￼
Since launching iblazr, more than 20,000 users in 195 countries snapped over 150,000 photos with the help of our flash. iblazr is currently available in more than 45 countries, in hundred of shops, including Apple Stores and Best Buy, and online. Today every iblazr user is an essential part of our team, project and history.
 
 
 
  
iblazr 2, the second generation in the iblazr flash series, is the most advanced light source for smartphones and tablets available in the consumer market. This flash designed for smartphones also comes in handy when taking photos with tablets or DSLR cameras, lighting analogue photography, brightening nighttime video calls, or simply functioning as a small but powerful flashlight. 
In creating iblazr 2, we not only optimized the physical design of the device but also made significant improvements to its electronic components. The result is an iblazr with more functions that remains as easy to use as it was before.
 
 
 
 
iblazr 2 is the only flash that works with native camera apps on your iPhone, iPad and Android smartphones!
 
 
You simply use Bluetooth to connect iblazr 2 to your smartphone, then launch the native camera app. By tapping the iblazr device twice, it will beam a powerful 300 LUX on 1m flash synchronically with your camera’s shutter! That's absolutely magical.
 
 
 
 
iblazr 2 uses Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy technology that transforms the iblazr into a remote flash with a range of up to 80 feet (25 meters).
 
 
 
 
We added a touch sensor to iblazr 2 for a more comfortable and intuitive user experience. This sensor lets you adjust the light color temperature from 3200K to 5600K to help you take better photographs in every situation. Want to get up close for a fancy portrait? Choose your warm light setting. Need a powerful cold flash, instead? Change the setting to 5600K mode. This flexibility will allow you to shoot photos that look more natural, professional and creative.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only measuring 40mm x 28mm x 10mm (1.57"" x 1.1"" x 1.57""), iblazr is compact in addition to being smart and extremely multifunctional. Check out all its features below:
 
 
 
 
We knew that a brilliant, new hardware solution could compromise software improvements. This prompted us to invent Shotlight—the alternative camera app that allows users to make adjustments manually.

iblazr 2 provides 300 Lux on 1m in Flash mode (2X more than a smartphone flash) and 150 Lux in Constant light mode (up to 10X more than a smartphone video light).

It clips to both the lower edge of an iPad Air 2 and the upper edge of an iPhone 4.With multiple clips you can use an array of units to enlarge the total amount of light you require. Each unit multiplies the amount of illumination you receive. For example, 3 iblazr units = 3 times more light. 3 Iblazr² units = 3 times more light. The clip is specially designed to attach the iblazr flash to a large number of mobile devices, displays and other surfaces.  COLD SHOE. We know that your DSLR needs a small, powerful video light. We also know that iblazr 2, just as in iblazr’s first generation, will help you shoot great content by adding an extra light when necessary. To make adding light easier, we made a simple and efficient Cold Shoe Mount. If you take your most compact light companion with you to your next filming, you will be both surprised and delighted by how useful it proves to be!While shooting a brief interview in an urban environment.  DIFFUSER. Pros say that the best light is a soft light. We say the best light is the one that is with you! That's why we made a silicon diffuser with a small hole to fit on your key ring, so now you will never forget your iblazr at home.  Diffuser + Key Clasp. Keep the iblazr 2 with you always simply by clipping it to your key chain or belt. FLEXIBLE CHARGER (Sold Separately). Not only does the flexible charger charge the flash, it also functions as a lamp stand allowing iblazr 2 to provide illumination in a variety of situations even when your not taking photographs. The new flexible charger is now 15.75 inches (400 mm) long and able to hold not just an iblazr flash, but a heavy smartphone as well.                    We believe iblazr 2 will prove to be even more useful and handy than our already highly functional first generation flash. We worked as hard as possible between our previous campaign and now to further realise iblazr’s awesome potential. Now we again seek support from our backers to help us launch the mass production of iblazr 2. The money you help us raise will allow us to manufacture molds, purchase electronics, organise the mass production and delivery of new units, meet certification standards, and complete other tasks necessary to make this product work even better than you expect it to. (Similar to our previous campaign, these funds will also help us design and implement new features based on our backers’ ideas for improving this flash.)  We believe that with help of creative people our product can be more multifunctional and useful. Similar to our previous campaign, we are offering you the opportunity to sync the iblazr 2 flash with apps you create. SDK will allow iOS and Android developers to play with the following settings: flash timing, LED brightness, LED color temperature, strobe mode, among many others settings.Now we have made it even simpler for you to implement the code and control the flash. Moreover, our support team is always near to help you use instructions and create awesome photo/video apps absolutely FREE.   Our jobs are our passion. We are a small team that is truly passionate about what we do. That is why we never accepted outside investments and why we remain 100% focused on product development and expansion. Thanks mainly to the support of our backers, following our first campaign we were able to undertake an enormous effort to bring iblazr to people all over the world.Each person of our team does whatever is necessary to realise this collective dream of ours. It is just one of many reasons we do not call the work that we do work. To us, this project is so much more.

<h2><strong><em>The GeoActivate App stops you having to think about sending text messages or emails whilst driving - it will automatically send them for you!</em></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>It will also wake you up on a train when you get near to your station and it will automatically switch on your driveway lights or open your gates as you approach your house! </em></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>We all have Smart Phones and we LOVE to communicate.  These enhance our lives, our efficiency and help us conduct business like never before.  We can now let people know where we are and warn friends or clients if we are going to be late - but we can't do that whilst we are driving,<em><strong> - or can we?</strong></em></p>
<p>The GeoActivate App harnesses the power of our Smart Phone to constantly monitor where we are and it then sends out pre-defined text or email messages AUTOMATICALLY according to where we are or whether we have just left somewhere - or indeed if we are about to arrive somewhere! <br/><br/>This is called ""Geo-Triggering"" and the App can create four types of Geo-Triggered events:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Alarm Events</strong></h3>
<p>In its simplest form the App will sound an alarm and alert you, or wake you up,  when you cross a GeoFence, (an imaginary line across a map) or get say within 5 miles of your destination. </p>
<p>This isn't one for driving!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You set up a new <strong>Alarm Event</strong> when you are travelling somewhere on say a train or bus and are likely to drift off to sleep after a long day at work - or whilst you're listening to relaxing music through your iPhone's ear buds.   When you get close to your destination the alarm sounds and wakes you up in time to get your things together and not miss your stop.</p>
<p>You can also use this feature whilst walking or driving to remind you of something as you approach somewhere. Maybe you are in your car and getting close to the toll bridge and you should be getting your coins to hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>SMS Events</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The first major feature is Automatic Text Messaging.</strong></p>
<p>You can set up a pre-defined text message to be sent automatically.  You can type in a completely new message or use one of the available standard messages such as ""Just left work"".  You can then edit this text making it something like: ""Just left work, see you in an hour, love Bob x""</p>
<p>You then set the Trigger Condition - which can be:</p>
<p>When I leave a pre-defined location<br/>When I arrive at or get within x miles of a destination<br/>When I cross this geofence ( a map location)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a really great feature and you can use it going to and from work to let someone know that you are on your way - or maybe you are only 5 miles away and want them to know that you will be arriving soon!</p>
<p>If you are picking a colleague up in the car on the way to a meeting, you can set an ""I'm here!"" message up to automatically send when you are just round the corner - so that he or she can come out and just hop in the car!  No waiting around when you get there!</p>
<p>You can use this for all sorts of quick text messages which might have tempted you to text whilst driving.  <strong><em>You only have to look at the latest crash fatality statistics to remind yourself that this is NOT a good idea.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's say for example that you are due to pick up your teenage daughter from friends or maybe from a night club which maybe isn't located in the best neighbourhood. </p>
<p><em>The GeoActivate App can automatically text her to be ready just before you arrive.  You can set the trigger distance anything you like such as 100m, 500yds or even 2 miles for example from your destination.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Email Events</strong></h3>
<p>Very similar to SMS / Text Message Events are <strong>Email Events</strong>.<br/>You set them up in exactly the same way and the GeoActivate App will email any contact with a pre-defined message when you get near to or leave a location.</p>
<p>This is a great feature for business travellers who can for example set up a series of emails to be sent to a client or business colleague when they get say 30 miles , then 20 miles, then 10 miles etc. from their location or office so that they know <em>exactly</em> where their appointment has got to! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Remote Control Events</strong></h3>
<p>This is going to be the fun bit!</p>
<p>We are sourcing and building some compact SMS Relay Receiver boxes from 1 to 7 channels.  All you do is pop in a basic PAYG (Pay As You Go) Sim card into the device and the GeoActivate App will be able to send coded commands to the unit from just about anywhere to control the relays!<br/><br/>This gives you the ability to automatically switch just appliances or devices on or off as you approach or pass a location.  For example, you could set an Event up to open your garage doors or your electric gates - or switch on your driveway or house lights just as you arrive home!</p>
<p><br/>You could even automatically switch them all off again when you leave!</p>
<p>You could switch the coffee pot on when you are 10 miles from home - or turn on the office heating when you leave your house.</p>
<p>You don't have to be driving - you could be walking or cycling and turn your portch light on as you get 100 yds from your house.  No more fumbling with keys or finding your LED keyfob torch in the dark!</p>
<p><br/>You can probably think of many more things you could do with this technology than we can - so let us know if you have any great ideas and we'll share them!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This is what the App will look like:-</strong></p>

<p><strong><br/>How we will use and funds raised?</strong></p>
<p>The App is our passion and we have already started writing it and testing the bits that are finished - so we are VERY confident of completing it on time.</p>
<p>We have invested a lot of time and money so far ourselves but need your help for the last push.  We want to add and refine these great new features and do more research and development on the the Home Automation elements of the App.</p>
<p>We are talking to Home Automation companies and want to explore more ideas with them.<br/><br/>The App initially runs on an iPhone running iOS 5 or later and the project funding target will enable us to get a very refined version of the App out within about a month.<br/><br/>If we exceed our target (and I REALLY hope we will!),  then any money will go towards an Android port and designing a lower cost relay box so everyone can benefit.</p>
<p><br/>If the funds are there we will start this work one month after launch.</p>
<p><br/><br/>We would also like to produce a Lite or Free version of the App with some limited features and any extra funding will help make this happen quickly.</p>
<p>We have lots more ideas for enhancements and follow-on products and we can't wait to share them with you after we get this one off the ground!</p>
<p>Any backers giving $25 or more will get a vote on which of our ideas we implement first!</p>
<p>You could be part of a great thing here - a fully functional App that is actually useful to a lot of people and can help save lives by removing the need for people to text and drive!<br/><br/>Ask us any questions you might have and join in with us if you can - lets have some fun!<br/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and challenges </strong></h3>
<p>We are asking for less than half the cost of producing the GeoActivate App and so we are very confident that we will be able to complete the project on time. </p>
<p>The App is specified and a very competent development team in place and software is being written now and so we are very confident that any backers will receive their App rewards on or about the time stated.</p>
<p>Software is never finished and there are bound to be niggles and problems after we launch as we discover what ingenious uses people are putting the App to! This is normal and we have on going software support to quickly fix any problems as soon as possible.</p>

<p>During our Kickstarter campaign and immediately after, we were overwhelmed by the waves of developers asking us for a dev board based on MATRIX. Their request was for us to release a hardware building block that was inexpensive, packed with enough components to make it compelling, and easy for them to start developing applications for MATRIX.</p>
</div><div>
<p>This occurred organically based on developer-centric input and we decided to go to the drawing board and see if we could make it happen as a “starter MATRIX”.

<h2>Belon.gs In A Nutshell</h2>
<p>Hi! Ever lost anything important, or better yet, priceless? Yeah, well, <em>so have we</em>. That's why we thought up Belon.gs, a novel and thoroughly awesome way to make it tons harder to permanently lose your stuff.</p>
<p>How does it work, then? Check out the video -- or just read on, if you don't want to spend a couple of minutes to watch it.</p>
<p>Basically how we work is:</p>
<ol>
<li>You order tags - <strong>for free </strong>- on <a href=""http://belon.gs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website</a>, and we'll deliver them anywhere in the world.</li>
<li>You claim the tag stickers online, and then slap them onto your phone, laptop, wallet or whatever you don't want to lose.</li>
<li>In the case your stuff gets lost, whoever finds the item will most likely find the tag too.</li>
<li>The finder goes to the address on the tag and you'll get immediately notified (by email, SMS, instant message, whatever) that someone's found your stuff. You can then enter anonymous live chat with the finder and settle upon how to get your stuff back.</li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ol>
<div>You can also set a reward for your stuff via PayPal, to make it a little more likely for greedy moneygrubbers to return your things.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also have <a href=""http://belon.gs/pricing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">plans for corporate users with more needs</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have a totally awesome Finnish print house, so we're able to crank out these stickers -- did we mention every single one is unique, unlike some of the other companies in this same business? -- every which way we like.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, and as an added bonus feature -- gamification for the win! -- you can also <em>refer</em> your tags; ie. if you order tags and hand some of them out to your friends, you can become their referrer beforehand and reap awesome rewards for your World Domination Referral Ranking points. (What these awesome rewards are, we don't really know yet. But at least some of our Belon.gs swag.)</div>
<div>
<h3>So, Why Do We Need Money Then?</h3>
<p>We already have our website and service up and running, but it still needs a lot of work. And work does not come cheap. So that's one thing.</p>
<p>Then there are the expenses for producing the tags and mailing them all around the world. We have negotiated good deals with the tag factory and with some more money we can purchase a larger amount of tags at a time so they would become quite a lot cheaper for us.<br/>The same stands for mailing -- sending out large batches ends up being much cheaper for us.</p>
<p>Since it is a Flexible Funding campaign, every little helps. No matter how much we get, we can get at least a bit more stuff done.</p>
<p>We also have some Belon.gs swag: we can send you a t-shirt, for instance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>No Money? You Can Still Help.</h3>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Belon.gs In A Nutshell
Hi! Ever lost anything important, or better yet, priceless? Yeah, well, so have we. That's why we thought up Belon.gs, a novel and thoroughly awesome way to make it tons harder to permanently lose your stuff.
How does it work, then? Check out the video -- or just read on, if you don't want to spend a couple of minutes to watch it.
Basically how we work is:

You order tags - for free - on our website, and we'll deliver them anywhere in the world.
You claim the tag stickers online, and then slap them onto your phone, laptop, wallet or whatever you don't want to lose.
In the case your stuff gets lost, whoever finds the item will most likely find the tag too.
The finder goes to the address on the tag and you'll get immediately notified (by email, SMS, instant message, whatever) that someone's found your stuff. You can then enter anonymous live chat with the finder and settle upon how to get your stuff back.
That's it!

You can also set a reward for your stuff via PayPal, to make it a little more likely for greedy moneygrubbers to return your things.

 
We also have plans for corporate users with more needs.
 
We have a totally awesome Finnish print house, so we're able to crank out these stickers -- did we mention every single one is unique, unlike some of the other companies in this same business? -- every which way we like.
 
Oh, and as an added bonus feature -- gamification for the win! -- you can also refer your tags; ie. if you order tags and hand some of them out to your friends, you can become their referrer beforehand and reap awesome rewards for your World Domination Referral Ranking points. (What these awesome rewards are, we don't really know yet. But at least some of our Belon.gs swag.)

So, Why Do We Need Money Then?
We already have our website and service up and running, but it still needs a lot of work. And work does not come cheap. So that's one thing.
Then there are the expenses for producing the tags and mailing them all around the world. We have negotiated good deals with the tag factory and with some more money we can purchase a larger amount of tags at a time so they would become quite a lot cheaper for us.The same stands for mailing -- sending out large batches ends up being much cheaper for us.
Since it is a Flexible Funding campaign, every little helps. No matter how much we get, we can get at least a bit more stuff done.
We also have some Belon.gs swag: we can send you a t-shirt, for instance.


No Money? You Can Still Help.


More than anything (aside from money), we're going to need traction, to make Belon.gs a truly global, world-wide institution. So what you can do, if you can't donate yourself for whatever reason, is

Above all, spread the word! Let your friends, your foes, or just random strangers on the street know about Belon.gs and this campaign. (You can use the share buttons right here too.)
Order tags and tag your items! (Mention Indiegogo and we'll try and send you a little more so you can give some out to your friends.)
Or if you have any awesome, grand ideas that could help us along, then we'd love to hear about them!

<p>M3 Cases is a small business I run out of my home shop making custom aluminum small form factor (SFF) computer cases. Inspired by the <a href=""http://hardforum.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[H]ard|Forum</a> community, M3 is for enthusiasts by an enthusiast.</p>
<p><strong>What is M3A2?</strong></p>
<p>As a PC gamer and case mod enthusiast, I have always appreciated a compact purpose built computer case. Problem is, very few exist that are exactly what you want. So, I have taken some of my ideas and added feedback from the PC enthusiast community to create the M3A2, a slim mini ITX case designed specifically for powerhouse hardware and those lengthy graphics cards we all love.</p>
<p>The case is machined entirely out of aluminum. The front, rear and sides are a solid 4mm thick extrusion. The top and bottom panels are 3mm plates. The PCI mounting bracket and case stand are machined from 6mm aluminum bar stock. It's a solid beast.</p>
<p>Finished off in a subdued textured black powder coat, the M3A2 has a very understated minimalistic appearance, but still has the mean performance look.</p>
<p>Configure the front panel to your needs. You can opt for a ultra-clean look with nothing but a pin-hole power LED, or go for complete functionality with USB3.0, slot-load optical and Bulgin-style LED ring power button.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p>I want to bring a case to the community that is designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts and offer a product that meets the demands of gamers and their hardware, all while allowing users to put a personal touch on their case.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do to help?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Please, <strong>make a donation</strong> and <strong>spread the word</strong> about this project. I need your support to make this happen and every little bit can go a long way to help if we band together! Share the link to this campaign!</p>
<p><strong>How will the donations be used?</strong></p>
<p>The money you graciously contribute will go towards CNC equipment, tooling and development and testing of the M3A2 Beta cases. The CNC mill/router, tooling and materials required to make these cases are not cheap, so every little bit helps make this happen.</p>
<p><strong>What does the future hold after this campaign?</strong></p>
<p>My hope is for this M3A2 concept to lead to more designs to fit a broader range of hardware and applications. Already in the works is a miniature version of the M3A2 design for single slot low profile cards, perfect for mini gaming systems or home theater PCs. And the design can easily be expanded to accomodate mATX and ATX motherboards for added versatility!</p>
<p><strong>What do you get for contributing?</strong></p>
<p>Above all else, no matter what you give, I give you my heart felt thanks for your interest and contribution into this project. It would not be possible without you. A special thanks page will be created on the M3cases.com website to pay tribute to those who made it all possible.</p>
<p>For those of you who felt inspired to give <strong>$20</strong>, along with the special thanks, you will be placed on the priority list for the next run of M3A2 cases. And if you so choose to order an M3A2 case, you will receive $20 off your purchase!</p>
<p>And if you felt it in your heart to graciously give <strong>$250</strong> or more, you will be the recipient of one of eight of the M3A3 Beta cases. Along with one of the limited run beta models you will be afforded extra personal touches on your case per your request (i.e. name engraving, logos, themes, etc.)</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b></b></p>
<p><b>A little history:</b>After some years shooting
documentaries with a DSLR in Patagonia Argentina, we realized that we  had
to improve the quality, but in the meantime we needed more portability and fast
access to the gear.<br/>
The first issue we had were the batteries, too little power for too many hours
on location.<br/>
The second issue was the center of gravity, Impossible to get stable
images without IS or bulky stabilizers.<br/>
Then, the most challenging one, improve the audio quality, and get
rid of that loudly noise floor.<br/>
After a lot of research and tryouts we requested a loan to the National
Government to start working on the prototype.<br/>
We had the Idea, the tools, and the experience of all the issues any filmmaker
around the world would face with a DSLR.</p>
<p><b>Where are we now?</b>We
are restyling the design with industrial designers, and reducing the
board so we can place new features inside Pandora for the streatch goals
and future upgrades. Also we are improving the audio quality, by removing most of the wires.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Challenges:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">The time is essential, it will
take a few month to manufacture the molds, and the boards, so you will have to
give us a hand and be part of that process.If we don't reach the 35k
goal, we´ll make the DSLR Optimizers one by one 3D printed in the best quality
possible or in fiber glass,  and we´ll send them in order of
backers. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Our main goal is to ship all Pandora´s before Christmas, but it may get delayed at some point in the manufacturing process, since there are so many cameras out there and we want the best fit for all of them. If you can´t wait we reccomend you to get the prototype perk, and you will get your Pandora in just a few months. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">But we think the biggest challenge is to make people understand that it is
possible to create one solution for most of our DSLR problems.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>How can I Help?</b>Share your thoughts! <br/>
We are already gathering ideas for electronic modules and 3D printed accessories.<br/>
Spread the word, let your colleagues know about Pandora, share on Facebook,
Twitter, Reddit and be part of the community.</p>
<p><b>International Customs?</b>Since your payment is
considered a donation, and Pandora is sent to you as a reward, the shipping
will be declared as a Gift with a Price of US$75. Also inside the Box there
will be an invoice for the amount of US$75.</p>
<p><b>Size of Pandora, weight and shipping box?</b>Pandora approximated size
is 30x16x5cm, the weight without batteries is around 800 grams, and the
shipping box is the size of a shoe box.</p>
<p><b>Pandora is an audio recorder like Zoom or Tascam? </b>No, pandora is not an external recorder. Pandora takes the audio from the Microphone/s and sends the signal to the camera, allowing you to control the audio levels manually and removing the ""Hiss"" recorded into the video.<br/></p>
<p><b>How Pandora transfer the Power to the camera? </b>Pandora comes with a DC coupler for your camera model, that goes into the battery compartment of your camera.<br/></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Without batteries?</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Yes, The
regulations, published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA),
prohibit transport of lithium batteries.</span><br/></p>
<p>
But you can buy them easily in your city, from Amazon or Ebay.</p>
<p>The model of the batteries is 18650, the
same as used in notebooks.</p>
<p>Try to avoid the cheapest ""highest
Mah"" models, look for LG or Samsung no more than 2.600mah. Don´t mix the
brand or model. You need TEN 18650 from the same brand and Mah.<br/>
Our product is made the safest way possible, but it is still a product and can
have a malfunction like any other electrical products in the world.<br/>
The 18650 costs about 5 Dollars each. You need 10 of those. So for 50 Dollars
you will have more than 103.6Wh. / 14.000Mah  <br/>
You can't use Standard AA or AAA or C or D batteries, ONLY 3.7 volts Lithium
18650.We are making a list with different places where to buy the batteries, in
every country that requested a Pandora. If you know about a place. send us the
information through this link:  <a href=""http://goo.gl/forms/EJQp4SXOQs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/forms/EJQp4SXOQs</a></p>
<p><b>Does Pandora work with all the cameras? </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Yes and no. Pandora has 3 key features. Energy, Audio, and Stability. All the cameras can be attached to Pandora with the mount thread. Not every camera allows to use a DC coupler, (or has a DC Input). Not all the cameras has a Mic Input, (which is a requirement for the audio features).<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If your camera can be attached to Pandora you can use it. As simple as that.<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To know if your camera can use the 3 key features of Pandora check the list:<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><a href=""https://goo.gl/BVD9Pm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://goo.gl/BVD9Pm</a><br/></span></p>
<p>If your camera is not in the list, check if you have Mic input, google for ""your camera model + DC Coupler"", and check if it has a 1/4 tripod thread on the bottom.</p>
<p>At some cases like Nikon D4 and Canon 1D, we will charge extra to provide the DC coupler for the power connection. Contact us if you have problems with that.</p>
<p>Those cameras that use 5v like the Gopro, Nikon Coolpix, Tablets and Smartphones, are Ok, since Pandora also provides 2 USB Outputs with 5 volts.</p>
<p><b>I have a slim/mirrorless camera, like BMPCC
or Sony a7s. Will it work?</b>This is the ideal tool for those cameras, since those
slim models tend to have more vibration and smaller battery power. We are
making special adapters that fits directly in Pandora to make every camera
model as comfortable as possible holding handheld. </p>
<p><b>Does Pandora work with my
Phone/Tablet? </b>You can replace the camera using your smartphone or tablet,
make sure you have the adapting mount, which you can buy from us or print
yourself for free. After that, just connect Pandora to your phone´s mic
Input. Also you can feed/charge your mobile device via the USB port at the
same time you are shooting videos, that way you will never run out of
batteries! </p>
<p><b>How can I choose Pandora color and my
camera model for the grip?</b>We will send out a survey soon so we can start
putting orders on different accessories and adapters. </p>
<p><b>I want more than one Pandora. What should I
do?</b> You can buy as many as you want, don´t add the shipping cost, we will
contact you with the exact cost depending on the quantity you ordered and the
destiny for the shipping.</p>
<p><b>The Team behind Pandora:</b> We are a team
of Argentinean filmmakers, designers, developers and engineers with the crazy
idea of making a product that is actually what the big companies left behind in
the DSLRs at a very affordable price. The filmmakers provided the problems and
the best solution for them. The engineers developed the main components and the
designers put all that together the most useful way possible. Filmmakers tested
the first prototypes and requested some modifications to the engineers and
designers. New prototype arrived to the filmmakers and had a great result. Now
we just have to raise the money to improve the design, make the molds and produce Pandora in a big scale to start
shipping worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Why don´t we sell Pandora´s patent to a big
company for manufacturing and distribution?</b> As you know, companies tend to
buy this patents and never produce them, so they can sell you different
products at higher price rate. And we want this product to be on the market.</p>
<p><b>We will stay self-funded to maintain the
control over our process, growth, and vision. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1406925/files/20150422135312-line2.jpg?1429735992"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></b></p>

You improve your battery duration
You improve your sound on camera.
You improve your video, removing the wobble and the microvibrations

You save a lot of money in gear.


You save a lot of time & problems on location.


You save lot of postproduction hours.


Fits in one small backpack.

You save weight on your travels.
Much, much more...






Pandora has a 14.000Mah battery, with enough power for the camera and two attached accessories to shoot for more than 5 hours! 
And if you’re just running the camera, more than 15 hours of video!



-More than 15 hours shooting video sporadically.


-More than 96Gb recorded onto your Canon SD.


-More than 14.000Mah


-More than 103.6Wh. 


-It´s like 14 Canon LP-E8 Batteries in your camera.



« 10 Hours of video without overheating the camera. »










Solar Panel  and micro USB charger.Easy and secure.Charge with the sun, or anywhere in the world with your cellphone charger.No more adapters, no more bulky chargers.

The Solar Panel provides power to the audio battery to avoid runing out of juice in case you can´t charge your Pandora in a couple of days. The SP is 1 Watt.
Pandora has 2 batteries, the main one that give the power to the camera and   accessories outputs, and the Audio Battery, that feeds the audio board and the Phantom Power for the mics.The audio battery has more than 4500Mah while a Juicedlink has only 800Mah.
Also you can charge Pandora with your standard battery charger, just plug the DC Coupler to the Battery charger, and then plug it to Pandora. 
With Pandora you wont wake up in the middle of the night to change the battery in the charger. 





Also you can re-use the batteries from old laptops, ask your friends for those old batteries. We will be uploading a video-tutorial on how to bring them back to life!Save money! Save the earth!


With Pandora you get more than 24 hours time-lapse.









Pandora provides to the DSLR the same audio quality as the Yamaha consoles


Don´t sync any more. Pandora improves the audio recorded to the video. So you don´t need any external recorders and to waste  a lot of hours synchronizing the audio  to the video files.



The test:SPOILER ALERT! - Our prototype has less noise than the ZOOM H4N


Plug in your headphones and listen carefully...






Pandora Improves the audio quality removing the noise floor from your Camera.And if you are a detail-freak, you can always make it better in post. The noise reduction will be more accurate since there is less noise floating around in all the frequencies.
Download our audio sample and try it yourself.



2 balanced XLR inputs  with individual Phantom Power +48v.2 mini-jacks 3.5mm and 2 jacks 6.5mm.Individual channel control.Audio braketing (One Mic with two channel at different levels).









Audio Monitoring via Headphones and Vu-meter.The unique form factor allows the Vu-meters to be allways at sight.





Also there is a volume control in the headphones so you can increase the signal and listen even in the loudest place.














Shoulder grip means it´s steadier, it´s light and fast.



Use the back of Pandora to grip your shoulder and distribute the weight between your arm and your body.







Turn your gear from a handy-cam to a shoulder-cam in 1 second.



Keep your right hand over the DSLR controls.  Change your iris, shutter speed, ISO and your WB faster than ever.

The SNIPER MODE is the best way to get stabilized shots on your DSLR. The back of Pandora is a supporting point, you don't need to ""Press"" against your chest, you barely feel Pandora touching you, and you get to rest your arm, and get more stable images.It´s so natural that you won´t even notice it is there.


Watch the video sample with raw footage, filmed with the T3I, Canon 50mm (80mm Equivalent) and Digital Zoom (3x, 240mm equivalent). No tripod, no image stabilization in lens nor in post.










Check the list to see if your camera model is supported by Pandora.LIST:  https://goo.gl/9ih9xU











Change your camera, keep Pandora. Use a small accessory (included) to adapt each camera model for a perfect grip.
Look at the LIST for your camera compatibility: 


Stop looking for your SDs.Change your SD Card within seconds and don´t miss a shot never again.















You can attach an optional base-plate with 15mm rods, to use a matte-box and your follow focus.









Improve your Pandora with free to print 3D accessories.


From FOLLOW FOCUS to TV Prompter. All You need under creative commons license. Pandora is expandable, ready to plug any accessories you need. It has simple pressure holes, and some 1/4""-20  mounting threads on the bottom, also the rails on the side and the back provide a great place for multiple accesories.




Our electric design is expandable, just like a PC, you can insert new modules with different applications. This makes Pandora possibilities, endless.We are already thinking in some of the boards, like a GPS tracker, an Intervalometer, audio recorder and much more.













Your gear is protected.Internal fuses and zener diodes are specially placed to protect your camera, accessories, and your microphones.If your camera battery says 7.2v or 7.4, you are ready to use PANDORA.Remember that Pandora won´t deliver more than 9 volts from the DC outputs, unless you turn the 12v output switch on.Most cameras supports up to 12v safety so don´t worry.Also most monitors and led lights can be connected to Pandora with a Sony Coupler to the 7.4v DC output.

Why support us?

We need your help to manufacture this product at a low cost and to make
it available for everyone that shoots videos with DSLRs &
mirrorless.We made this product
so people like us, won´t have to deal with the problems we had in the past.
If you support us now, you will get a very special price, more than 50% off the
retail price, and you will have Pandora on your hands by the end of 2015, you
won´t have to wait until 2017 for the official product release.






A little history:After some years shooting
documentaries with a DSLR in Patagonia Argentina, we realized that we  had
to improve the quality, but in the meantime we needed more portability and fast
access to the gear.
The first issue we had were the batteries, too little power for too many hours
on location.
The second issue was the center of gravity, Impossible to get stable
images without IS or bulky stabilizers.
Then, the most challenging one, improve the audio quality, and get
rid of that loudly noise floor.
After a lot of research and tryouts we requested a loan to the National
Government to start working on the prototype.
We had the Idea, the tools, and the experience of all the issues any filmmaker
around the world would face with a DSLR.
Where are we now?We
are restyling the design with industrial designers, and reducing the
board so we can place new features inside Pandora for the streatch goals
and future upgrades. Also we are improving the audio quality, by removing most of the wires.

Challenges:The time is essential, it will
take a few month to manufacture the molds, and the boards, so you will have to
give us a hand and be part of that process.If we don't reach the 35k
goal, we´ll make the DSLR Optimizers one by one 3D printed in the best quality
possible or in fiber glass,  and we´ll send them in order of
backers. Our main goal is to ship all Pandora´s before Christmas, but it may get delayed at some point in the manufacturing process, since there are so many cameras out there and we want the best fit for all of them. If you can´t wait we reccomend you to get the prototype perk, and you will get your Pandora in just a few months. But we think the biggest challenge is to make people understand that it is
possible to create one solution for most of our DSLR problems.
How can I Help?Share your thoughts! 
We are already gathering ideas for electronic modules and 3D printed accessories.
Spread the word, let your colleagues know about Pandora, share on Facebook,
Twitter, Reddit and be part of the community.
International Customs?Since your payment is
considered a donation, and Pandora is sent to you as a reward, the shipping
will be declared as a Gift with a Price of US$75. Also inside the Box there
will be an invoice for the amount of US$75.
Size of Pandora, weight and shipping box?Pandora approximated size
is 30x16x5cm, the weight without batteries is around 800 grams, and the
shipping box is the size of a shoe box.
Pandora is an audio recorder like Zoom or Tascam? No, pandora is not an external recorder. Pandora takes the audio from the Microphone/s and sends the signal to the camera, allowing you to control the audio levels manually and removing the ""Hiss"" recorded into the video.
How Pandora transfer the Power to the camera? Pandora comes with a DC coupler for your camera model, that goes into the battery compartment of your camera.
Without batteries?Yes, The
regulations, published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA),
prohibit transport of lithium batteries.

But you can buy them easily in your city, from Amazon or Ebay.
The model of the batteries is 18650, the
same as used in notebooks.
Try to avoid the cheapest ""highest
Mah"" models, look for LG or Samsung no more than 2.600mah. Don´t mix the
brand or model. You need TEN 18650 from the same brand and Mah.
Our product is made the safest way possible, but it is still a product and can
have a malfunction like any other electrical products in the world.
The 18650 costs about 5 Dollars each. You need 10 of those. So for 50 Dollars
you will have more than 103.6Wh. / 14.000Mah  
You can't use Standard AA or AAA or C or D batteries, ONLY 3.7 volts Lithium
18650.We are making a list with different places where to buy the batteries, in
every country that requested a Pandora. If you know about a place. send us the
information through this link:  http://goo.gl/forms/EJQp4SXOQs
Does Pandora work with all the cameras? Yes and no. Pandora has 3 key features. Energy, Audio, and Stability. All the cameras can be attached to Pandora with the mount thread. Not every camera allows to use a DC coupler, (or has a DC Input). Not all the cameras has a Mic Input, (which is a requirement for the audio features).If your camera can be attached to Pandora you can use it. As simple as that.To know if your camera can use the 3 key features of Pandora check the list:https://goo.gl/BVD9Pm
If your camera is not in the list, check if you have Mic input, google for ""your camera model + DC Coupler"", and check if it has a 1/4 tripod thread on the bottom.
At some cases like Nikon D4 and Canon 1D, we will charge extra to provide the DC coupler for the power connection. Contact us if you have problems with that.
Those cameras that use 5v like the Gopro, Nikon Coolpix, Tablets and Smartphones, are Ok, since Pandora also provides 2 USB Outputs with 5 volts.
I have a slim/mirrorless camera, like BMPCC
or Sony a7s. Will it work?This is the ideal tool for those cameras, since those
slim models tend to have more vibration and smaller battery power. We are
making special adapters that fits directly in Pandora to make every camera
model as comfortable as possible holding handheld. 
Does Pandora work with my
Phone/Tablet? You can replace the camera using your smartphone or tablet,
make sure you have the adapting mount, which you can buy from us or print
yourself for free. After that, just connect Pandora to your phone´s mic
Input. Also you can feed/charge your mobile device via the USB port at the
same time you are shooting videos, that way you will never run out of
batteries! 
How can I choose Pandora color and my
camera model for the grip?We will send out a survey soon so we can start
putting orders on different accessories and adapters. 
I want more than one Pandora. What should I
do? You can buy as many as you want, don´t add the shipping cost, we will
contact you with the exact cost depending on the quantity you ordered and the
destiny for the shipping.
The Team behind Pandora: We are a team
of Argentinean filmmakers, designers, developers and engineers with the crazy
idea of making a product that is actually what the big companies left behind in
the DSLRs at a very affordable price. The filmmakers provided the problems and
the best solution for them. The engineers developed the main components and the
designers put all that together the most useful way possible. Filmmakers tested
the first prototypes and requested some modifications to the engineers and
designers. New prototype arrived to the filmmakers and had a great result. Now
we just have to raise the money to improve the design, make the molds and produce Pandora in a big scale to start
shipping worldwide.
Why don´t we sell Pandora´s patent to a big
company for manufacturing and distribution? As you know, companies tend to
buy this patents and never produce them, so they can sell you different
products at higher price rate. And we want this product to be on the market.
We will stay self-funded to maintain the
control over our process, growth, and vision. 













Estimate development time

We need your help to develop Pandora and start
mass production. You'll be the first to
receive Pandora at a price significantly less than future retail price. 
Prototypes:Currently we have fully working prototypes,
some of the photos/videos in the campaign are from a prototype, and other
computer generated. Our task is to improve our model according to the
production line we will use, depending on the funds we rise.
Production: The whole production process is
monitored at the highest level by well-known professionals in their field, and
each unit will be TESTED before shipping.
Delivery time:We understand the whole seriousness of our
work, and we understand that our terms of production and date of perk delivery
may change. 
We will try to accelerate the
production pipeline, so everyone could have their Pandora as soon as possible.
We will cover all stages of production, so you will be informed of the course
of work and the date of delivery.  The main idea is to ship Pandora in December, but that date depends in the money we rise, the time it takes to rise that money, and the production line we choose. Some tooling process takes longer than others. Please support us and let Pandora be a part
of your crew. Upon successful completion of the campaign, follow the updates section on this page and on our website. In addition, we will contact you to clarify all issues, and to get the details of delivery, and model of your camera. 
Warranty period of
Pandora:  1 year.




We are still designing some of the accessories, so you can´t order them yet.We´ll let you know as soon as we have the definitive list with the final prices wich depend on the material and production method used.They will be made in wood, aluminum or plastic.The price will be accessible and some models will be available online for 3D printing.We get your mail when you buy Pandora. We will contact you soon.If we have a successful campaign we will send free accessories to our supporters.",81.0,6,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><em>What Are SmartRounds?</em></strong></p>
<p>These micro-controlled non-lethal, non-impact smart bullets will initially be available in two versions.  A <b><i>ShockRound</i></b> and a <b><i>PepperRound</i></b>.
Each one is equipped with two solid state micro-sensors that turn ON the round
when fired, and activate the round millisecs before impact. These projectiles
are designed to be fired from a standard 12 gauge shotgun at 450 feet per
second and have a range of 100 yards. Both are lightweight, carbon fiber
projectiles that produce a low-recoil which allows them to be fired from various
12 gauge shotgun formats. The <b><i>ShockRound</i></b> produces a flash-bang and
nitrogen gas shock wave that disables the assailant. The <b><i>PepperRound</i></b> produces a
flash-bang and a capsaicin cloud that causes a burning sensation to the eyes
and throat rendering the assailant unable to continue.</p>

<p><strong>Nick's Story</strong></p>
<p>Nick is a mechanical engineer. He received his BSME from New
Jersey Institute of Technology. He also has a MBA from Rutgers University. Nick
has worked in the field of compressed gases and cryogenics for over 25 years.
He was the founder and principal engineer at Nitronics Systems, Inc. which
designed and manufactured microprocessor controlled nitrogen generators.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In April 1999 things changed dramatically for Nick. That was when the
terrible tragedy of Columbine occurred. Nick had moved his family to Colorado
in 1993. Nick thought if that horrible event could happen in peaceful
Columbine, Colorado then it could happen anywhere in America.</p>
<p>He started thinking about what could be done to prevent this and other
events like this from happening again. He decided that law abiding and trained
individuals needed to have a truly effective non-lethal weapon as a choice to
defend themselves. Recent tragic events involving law enforcement officers and unarmed
citizens reinforce the need for police to have options other than lethal force.
</p>
<p>Nick started working on various less-lethal and non-lethal weapons that
military, law enforcement and private citizens could arm themselves with. Nick
started developing less-lethal impact type projectiles but eventually realized
that what was really needed was a non-lethal “smart bullet” that stopped an
assailant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2010 Nick formed SmartRounds Technology, LLC and he began
building various prototypes of smart bullets that could stop an attacker
without being lethal. After four years and many hours of engineering design, building and testing
Nick has arrived at two SmartRounds; a ShockRound and a PepperRound. There is a video on Youtube
that shows these two smart bullets in action.</p>

you had to buy a Webcam and connect to your computer? Remember when 
manufacturers started making computers and other devices with in-built 
Webcam? Now it's time for those Webcams to have an in-built ""SHUTTER"" that will solve the Spying problem(s). We all know necessity is the mother of all inventions so let me introduce you to my Webcam Spy Blocker called the ""MANUAL SHUTTER"". Also see my ""stretch goal"" of the ""Automatic Shutter"" below.<br/><div> <br/><b><h3>The ""MANUAL SHUTTER"" and It's IMPORTANCE<br/>
</h3></b><p>The ""MANUAL SHUTTER"" is manually operated as the name indicates, and is in-built into the device. This is not anything you've seen before because this is and will be the future of Webcam security. The shutter is conveniently controlled by a sliding button. Movement of the button helps the in-built shutter to open thereby
revealing the Webcam lenses for use OR slide in opposite direction to close, protect, and prevent hackers from
spying on unsuspecting victims in their privacy. The size of the button is about the same as the On/Off
buttons found on the side of cellular phones. It also has
grids for friction to ease movement by the user and does not prevent a laptop from closing or folding. It does not affect or interfere with the functions of your phone, tablets, or other webcam devices. The button is also design in a way that it can be anywhere on the frame of the device(computer/tablet/phone) and still function perfectly. Not only will this provide 
the much needed privacy and security in people's lives, it will also 
change the way computers and other devices with Webcam capability are made
 and manufactured. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843955/files/20140908193537-V1_WebCam_Blocker.jpg?1410230137"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><b><h3>The Impact on Consumers<br/>
</h3></b>
</div><div> <p>Webcams can and have always been hacked to spy
on people’s privacy. Unsuspecting victims continue to pay the price (see videos attached). Privacy is
a top priority for everyone. Most people including experts advise
consumers to use a piece of tape to cover the lenses of their Webcams. Sticky
tapes leave sticky mess on the devices and the camera, and sometimes falls off easily. </p>
<p>I even have a patent pending ""Clipper"", which would soon be made available for purchase on <a href=""http://www.webcamspyblocker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.webcamspyblocker.com</a>. The Clipper covers the lenses of existing computers, laptops, tablets, phones and other devices only when placed on the device. Although products like the Clipper is created for existing devices with Webcams, but they can be lost/stolen. Some people suggest using a ""software"" blocker. News flash my friends, all Software are made to be hacked. You just have to know what it does and then undo it. If big corporations like Target and Home Depot can be hacked, need I say more? Unlike anything else, the ""Manual Shutter"" is manufactured along with the 
device (in-built) and the only visible part will be the tiny button to 
operate. <br/></p>
<p>The only way you can ""hack"" HARDWARE is by being physically present with the device in your possession. This is what makes the ""Manual Shutter"" great and unmatched, which also takes the guessing game away by revolutionizing the way these devices are manufactured; period. This in-built shutter moves over the face of the Webcam lenses internally, preventing the viewing
of any object(s) in its direction. This invention will provide a lasting
solution to this growing technology problem. Even government agencies like the FBI can secretly spy on you through your Webcam lenses without your consent. What is your privacy worth to you and your family? Let's stop creepy webcam hackers for good.</p>

<h3>My Goal and How You Can Help<br/>
</h3> My goal is to manufacture 
working prototypes (Computer/Phone/Tablet) and present it to the top companies for licensing. And in a very short period of time, this kind 
of computer and device would be the norm on the shelves in your local stores.  Make this happen with your help and contribution. If you 
can't donate, please spread the word on Facebook, twitter, and other 
social media websites, and I'll be forever indebted to you.   <br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Just like every project, there are risk and challenges involved. However, I'm a firm believer that the only obstacle in your way that can stop you is the one that you let stand in your way of success. People should see obstacle as an opportunity to prove why you have become better at resolving issues; dealing with, and resolving unforeseen circumstances that comes your way. </p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln once said; ""We Can Complain Because Rose Bushes Have Thorns, or Rejoice
Because Thorn Bushes Have Roses."" Everything in life is simply how you approach it. I'm fully committed to making sure nothing stands in my way of this becoming a reality sooner than later. I'm working very closely with the engineering and supply chain to ensure that production will take place and be completed as scheduled. I've overcame many challenges in my personal and business life so this will not be the first or last.<br/></p>

</div><div>
<p>I also have a Patent Pending idea that solves the same problem. It's called the Automatic Shutter (AS). The AS works with Skype and other video chatting services. The difference in price point between the ""Manual Shutter""  and the ""Automatic Shutter"" gives consumers the option as to what to purchase. When you turn on a video chat like Skype on your laptop, phone or tablet, then the shutter automatically opens revealing the camera lenses. When you turn on your camera/webcams to take a picture, it automatically opens the shutter revealing the lenses. When done, the shutter automatically closes to cover the lenses until your next use. So, simply put, the shutters opens ONLY when the camera is <b>ON </b>and in use; then closes when the camera is not in use or <b>OFF</b>. <br/></p>
<p>This is a revolution and we will together change the way Webcam devices(including cell phones and tablets) are manufactured. Saying that your contribution to this project would be truly 
appreciated is simply an understatement. Any contribution received will be 
forever cherished, and I will truly be forever appreciative from the 
bottom of my heart. Thank you for your time and support!!!</p>
<h3>""Made it Happen Page""</h3>
<p>At the end of a successful campaign, I'll create a page on <a href=""http://www.webcamspyblocker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.webcamspyblocker.com</a> acknowledging the list of contributors and promoters that made this happen. Please let me know if you want to remain Anonymous and I'll be sure to respect your wishes. Thank You! <br/></p>

grids for friction to ease movement by the user and does not prevent a laptop from closing or folding. It does not affect or interfere with the functions of your phone, tablets, or other webcam devices. The button is also design in a way that it can be anywhere on the frame of the device(computer/tablet/phone) and still function perfectly. Not only will this provide 
the much needed privacy and security in people's lives, it will also 
change the way computers and other devices with Webcam capability are made
 and manufactured. 


The Impact on Consumers

 Webcams can and have always been hacked to spy
on people’s privacy. Unsuspecting victims continue to pay the price (see videos attached). Privacy is
a top priority for everyone. Most people including experts advise
consumers to use a piece of tape to cover the lenses of their Webcams. Sticky
tapes leave sticky mess on the devices and the camera, and sometimes falls off easily. 
I even have a patent pending ""Clipper"", which would soon be made available for purchase on www.webcamspyblocker.com. The Clipper covers the lenses of existing computers, laptops, tablets, phones and other devices only when placed on the device. Although products like the Clipper is created for existing devices with Webcams, but they can be lost/stolen. Some people suggest using a ""software"" blocker. News flash my friends, all Software are made to be hacked. You just have to know what it does and then undo it. If big corporations like Target and Home Depot can be hacked, need I say more? Unlike anything else, the ""Manual Shutter"" is manufactured along with the 
device (in-built) and the only visible part will be the tiny button to 
operate. 
The only way you can ""hack"" HARDWARE is by being physically present with the device in your possession. This is what makes the ""Manual Shutter"" great and unmatched, which also takes the guessing game away by revolutionizing the way these devices are manufactured; period. This in-built shutter moves over the face of the Webcam lenses internally, preventing the viewing
of any object(s) in its direction. This invention will provide a lasting
solution to this growing technology problem. Even government agencies like the FBI can secretly spy on you through your Webcam lenses without your consent. What is your privacy worth to you and your family? Let's stop creepy webcam hackers for good.



My Goal and How You Can Help
 My goal is to manufacture 
working prototypes (Computer/Phone/Tablet) and present it to the top companies for licensing. And in a very short period of time, this kind 
of computer and device would be the norm on the shelves in your local stores.  Make this happen with your help and contribution. If you 
can't donate, please spread the word on Facebook, twitter, and other 
social media websites, and I'll be forever indebted to you.   
  Risks & Challenges Just like every project, there are risk and challenges involved. However, I'm a firm believer that the only obstacle in your way that can stop you is the one that you let stand in your way of success. People should see obstacle as an opportunity to prove why you have become better at resolving issues; dealing with, and resolving unforeseen circumstances that comes your way. 


Abraham Lincoln once said; ""We Can Complain Because Rose Bushes Have Thorns, or Rejoice
Because Thorn Bushes Have Roses."" Everything in life is simply how you approach it. I'm fully committed to making sure nothing stands in my way of this becoming a reality sooner than later. I'm working very closely with the engineering and supply chain to ensure that production will take place and be completed as scheduled. I've overcame many challenges in my personal and business life so this will not be the first or last.


I also have a Patent Pending idea that solves the same problem. It's called the Automatic Shutter (AS). The AS works with Skype and other video chatting services. The difference in price point between the ""Manual Shutter""  and the ""Automatic Shutter"" gives consumers the option as to what to purchase. When you turn on a video chat like Skype on your laptop, phone or tablet, then the shutter automatically opens revealing the camera lenses. When you turn on your camera/webcams to take a picture, it automatically opens the shutter revealing the lenses. When done, the shutter automatically closes to cover the lenses until your next use. So, simply put, the shutters opens ONLY when the camera is ON and in use; then closes when the camera is not in use or OFF. 
This is a revolution and we will together change the way Webcam devices(including cell phones and tablets) are manufactured. Saying that your contribution to this project would be truly 
appreciated is simply an understatement. Any contribution received will be 
forever cherished, and I will truly be forever appreciative from the 
bottom of my heart. Thank you for your time and support!!!

<p>With only a few days left, it's apparent that we're not going to reach our goal of $20,000. This means that we won't be able to develop (for both iOS and Android) and release the app in May 2013.</p>
<p><strong>That's ok though because we're VERY close to having enough money for a working prototype!</strong></p>
<p>Which is why our NEW goal is $2500. Please open up your heart and donate today. Even just a few dollars will get us one step closer to being able to help thousands of deserving people.</p>
<h3>And remember, everyone who donates gets the app for free!</h3>
<p><br/><em><strong>Meet Our Inspiration...</strong></em></p>
<h2> <img alt=""Our Inspiration"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/644362_10152631126565704_1234147122_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

<h2>The Gluten Guru iPhone App</h2>
<p>What does farro, malt vinegar, semolina, and even Triticum dicoccon have in common?</p>
<p>They all contain gluten, a dangerous and hidden poison to those with celiac and gluten intolerance and it's hiding in thousands of products.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The GlutenGuru iPhone app will take the time and risk out of gluten-free shopping by allowing the user to scan the ingredients of food items. Our app will determine FOR them if the item is safe to consume.</li>
<li>With your donation we will be one step closer to reaching our goal of creating THE FIRST EVER iPhone application and mobile toolbox dedicated to making the grocery shopping experience faster and easier for people who have intolerance to Gluten.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>&gt;&gt; What Will Our App Do Upon Launch</h3>
<p><strong> Because after launch it's just going to get better!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With newly developed technology it will scan the ingredients in any product.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If the ingredients are gluten free users will be informed it is safe</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If the item is safe, users will be given an option to add the product to the database.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If the product contains gluten, users will be alerted and a list of the unsafe ingredients contained in the product will be listed.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>By building a significant database we will be able to improve the users experience and allow us to create new features for the app.</li>
</ul><p> <strong>There are 2 phases to our project.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1 will involve building the prototype, the database of ingredients, and the app itself. Then we will improve app functionality through extensive beta testing. Our app developer is local Edmontonian <a href=""https://twitter.com/seanhealy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Meet our app developer!"">@seanhealy</a>.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The 2nd phase involves more marketing, expanding the app functionality and technology and getting the app in front of the people who need it the most.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong><em>We're relying on YOU for your help and generosity. Please help us reach our goal!</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>&gt;&gt; Where The Money Will Go</h3>
<p> <strong>Here's a breakdown of why we need $20k</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost we need to build a prototype.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will need to build our basic app</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This will include a bar-code scanner and other technology we will be incorporating.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will need to beta test in order to debug and work out the glitches and will have subsequent costs associated with this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing and monthly fees will include hosting, licensing, bug fixes, app updates and upgrades and other maintenance costs</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We will then add new features into the app. Some examples including a sharable/savable shopping list, the ability to scan for other allergens and many more useful tools.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With our goal of wanting everyone to have access to our app we will need to build our app for other operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although we are both creative and resourceful we will need some for marketing if need be.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lastly-AFTER we have succeeded in our goal we would like to buy a bottle of bubbly and share a toast.</li>

<h3>&gt;&gt; Who We Are</h3>
<p>We're 2 Canadian sisters (Jodie Costello and <a href=""http://canadianseo.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melanie Nathan</a>) who are passionate and determined to make Celiac Disease more manageable for people worldwide.</p>
<p>Jodie is an expert at Gluten free living with a strong background in sales and technology. Her son has T1 diabetes and Celiac Disease and she understands the impact of modern wheat and the importance of a Gluten free life. Now she wants to make gluten free living easier for people to deal with by providing more options for food management and being the ""go to"" guru for safe non-gluten food choices.</p>
<p>Melanie has marketed for big brands and companies. She is an auntie of a child with Celiac. She has a strong background in tech and Internet Marketing and wants to help bring awareness to the plight of people who are having to struggle with an aversion or intolerance to Gluten.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Together we CAN make this a reality, but we NEED your help.</strong></em></p>
 </div>
<h3>&gt;&gt; Why We Are Fundraising</h3>
<p>Jodie is a stay-at-home mom, because she loves it and because of necessity and practicality. Daycare is expensive and depending on the work schedule, it can leave little time to prepare meals, shop and spend time with her family.</p>
<p>Her husband serves in the Canadian Forces which means he can be away a lot, sometimes for long periods of time and Jodie steps up to fill the gap every time. With the typical costs of raising a family, combined with the cost of her sons insulin and Diabetic supplies, coupled with the costs of a Diabetic/Celiac diet there is very little left over.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>&gt;&gt; The Impact</h3>
<p>""I was just diagnosed with Celiac 4 days ago. Just got home from my first grocery shopping trip in tears. Its so hard to decipher the packaging. I had to carry a 3 page list of do-not-eat ingredients with me, and I was still confused!"" - <em>Recently diagnosed Celiac sufferer</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this scenario is becoming all to common.</p>
<p>Access to - and education about - Gluten free foods prevents families with Celiac disease from:</p>
<ul>
<li>traveling</li>
<li>dining out</li>
<li>taking part in social activities</li>
<li>ensuring safe food choices</li>
</ul><p>This therefore decreases their quality of life while increasing indirect costs associated with the disease.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 30% of Celiac disease patients may develop a malignancy (non-Hodgkins lymphoma)! Adhering to a Gluten free diet is <strong>CRITICAL</strong> for preventative purposes, in spite of the personal costs.</p>
<p>The GlutenGuru iPhone app will take the time and risk out of gluten-free shopping. By allowing the user to scan the ingredients of food items, our app will determine FOR them, if the item is safe to consume.</p>
<p>Technology is always advancing and people with health issues can really benefit from this, more and more people are using smart phones as their ""go to"" answer. With your contribution, and our technology we want to bring it to a whole new level.</p>

</div></div>","Important Campaign Update:
With only a few days left, it's apparent that we're not going to reach our goal of $20,000. This means that we won't be able to develop (for both iOS and Android) and release the app in May 2013.
That's ok though because we're VERY close to having enough money for a working prototype!
Which is why our NEW goal is $2500. Please open up your heart and donate today. Even just a few dollars will get us one step closer to being able to help thousands of deserving people.
And remember, everyone who donates gets the app for free!
Meet Our Inspiration...
 

 
The Gluten Guru iPhone App
What does farro, malt vinegar, semolina, and even Triticum dicoccon have in common?
They all contain gluten, a dangerous and hidden poison to those with celiac and gluten intolerance and it's hiding in thousands of products.
 

The GlutenGuru iPhone app will take the time and risk out of gluten-free shopping by allowing the user to scan the ingredients of food items. Our app will determine FOR them if the item is safe to consume.
With your donation we will be one step closer to reaching our goal of creating THE FIRST EVER iPhone application and mobile toolbox dedicated to making the grocery shopping experience faster and easier for people who have intolerance to Gluten.
 
>> What Will Our App Do Upon Launch
 Because after launch it's just going to get better!

With newly developed technology it will scan the ingredients in any product.

If the ingredients are gluten free users will be informed it is safe

If the item is safe, users will be given an option to add the product to the database.

If the product contains gluten, users will be alerted and a list of the unsafe ingredients contained in the product will be listed.

By building a significant database we will be able to improve the users experience and allow us to create new features for the app.
 There are 2 phases to our project.

Phase 1 will involve building the prototype, the database of ingredients, and the app itself. Then we will improve app functionality through extensive beta testing. Our app developer is local Edmontonian @seanhealy.

The 2nd phase involves more marketing, expanding the app functionality and technology and getting the app in front of the people who need it the most.
 
We're relying on YOU for your help and generosity. Please help us reach our goal!
 

>> Where The Money Will Go
 Here's a breakdown of why we need $20k

First and foremost we need to build a prototype.


We will need to build our basic app


This will include a bar-code scanner and other technology we will be incorporating.


We will need to beta test in order to debug and work out the glitches and will have subsequent costs associated with this.


Ongoing and monthly fees will include hosting, licensing, bug fixes, app updates and upgrades and other maintenance costs


We will then add new features into the app. Some examples including a sharable/savable shopping list, the ability to scan for other allergens and many more useful tools.


With our goal of wanting everyone to have access to our app we will need to build our app for other operating systems.


Although we are both creative and resourceful we will need some for marketing if need be.


Lastly-AFTER we have succeeded in our goal we would like to buy a bottle of bubbly and share a toast.

 
>> Who We Are
We're 2 Canadian sisters (Jodie Costello and Melanie Nathan) who are passionate and determined to make Celiac Disease more manageable for people worldwide.
Jodie is an expert at Gluten free living with a strong background in sales and technology. Her son has T1 diabetes and Celiac Disease and she understands the impact of modern wheat and the importance of a Gluten free life. Now she wants to make gluten free living easier for people to deal with by providing more options for food management and being the ""go to"" guru for safe non-gluten food choices.
Melanie has marketed for big brands and companies. She is an auntie of a child with Celiac. She has a strong background in tech and Internet Marketing and wants to help bring awareness to the plight of people who are having to struggle with an aversion or intolerance to Gluten.
 
Together we CAN make this a reality, but we NEED your help.
 
>> Why We Are Fundraising
Jodie is a stay-at-home mom, because she loves it and because of necessity and practicality. Daycare is expensive and depending on the work schedule, it can leave little time to prepare meals, shop and spend time with her family.
Her husband serves in the Canadian Forces which means he can be away a lot, sometimes for long periods of time and Jodie steps up to fill the gap every time. With the typical costs of raising a family, combined with the cost of her sons insulin and Diabetic supplies, coupled with the costs of a Diabetic/Celiac diet there is very little left over.
 
>> The Impact
""I was just diagnosed with Celiac 4 days ago. Just got home from my first grocery shopping trip in tears. Its so hard to decipher the packaging. I had to carry a 3 page list of do-not-eat ingredients with me, and I was still confused!"" - Recently diagnosed Celiac sufferer
Unfortunately, this scenario is becoming all to common.
Access to - and education about - Gluten free foods prevents families with Celiac disease from:

traveling
dining out
taking part in social activities
ensuring safe food choices
This therefore decreases their quality of life while increasing indirect costs associated with the disease.
Furthermore, 30% of Celiac disease patients may develop a malignancy (non-Hodgkins lymphoma)! Adhering to a Gluten free diet is CRITICAL for preventative purposes, in spite of the personal costs.
The GlutenGuru iPhone app will take the time and risk out of gluten-free shopping. By allowing the user to scan the ingredients of food items, our app will determine FOR them, if the item is safe to consume.
Technology is always advancing and people with health issues can really benefit from this, more and more people are using smart phones as their ""go to"" answer. With your contribution, and our technology we want to bring it to a whole new level.

>> Frequently Asked Question

Q: Who is the kid in the photo??
A: He's the worst Waldo ever (because he's so easy to spot lol)! Actually, he's our inspiration for creating this app and our reason for wanting it to succeed. He is Jodie's son and he has Type 1 Diabetes as well as Celiac. As you can see by his pic, this doesn't prevent him from always smiling!

<p>Taille câble Sata classique (25Cm minimum)<br/></p>
<p><b>Nous ne connaissons aucun boitier accompagné d'un ventilateur derrière le CPU.</b> Pourtant les températures sont extrêmes et bien conservé.</p>
<p>Les aimants sont un vrai plaisir pour le câble management, vous pouvez dès le début de votre installation, trier vos câbles sans encombre, même les câbles reliant votre ou vos cartes graphiques, Ethernet, Etc ...<br/><br/>La Garantie Pandoradvanced 2 an:<br/>Bon c'est une première série, mais si par exemple au bout de 6mois votre peinture s'écaille ou un bras articulé casse par l'usure. On vous le change sans discuter!<br/>Parceque vous nous faites confiance sur IndieGoGo, on va faire ce qu'il faut pour rester soudé. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<b>You know the brand Pandoradvanced</b><br/><br/>Welcome to you who follow us from the beginning, you are there to learn more about the Crimson, I invite you to go lower.<br/><br/><b>You do not know the brand Pandoradvanced</b><br/><br/>I'm Christopher Fernandes, or Kriss. In 2014 I realized my first creations and son of needles I wove a small business.<br/>Today we are crazy creators of two numbers, the design is our passion and we seek innovation in the computer day after day, and if you are without even knowing us is a picture to get your attention.<br/>I invite you to discover our website by following the links above and to follow us on Facebook.<br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Motivation</b><br/>After the colossal project Jetblack: Office and computer, we had a few requests for an Pandoradvanced computer case.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463692316/vu_%C3%A9clate_qsgv1w.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 585.962px;height: 330px;""/><br/></p>

<br/>
<p><br/></p> <br/>So I challenged to draw and create with innovative Pandoradvanced case.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463795591/crimsondraw_r61xg0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463802380/Crimsonengros_ofau4l.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 610.897px;height: 344px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463783470/Dual_pazclo.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 614.647px;height: 346px;""/>

<br/><br/><b></b><br/>Why crowdfounding?<br/>It's very simple, here is a little overview of loads:<br/><br/>  Storage of goods<br/>  Local<br/>  Employees<br/>  employers charges<br/>  trips<br/>  electrics<br/>  phones<br/>  Software license<br/>  Models deposits<br/>  Prototyping<br/>  Etc., etc..<br/><br/>A classic business operation you say? The difference is that we offer a luxury product with low margin.<br/><br/>What is it you win it?<br/>Using Indiegogo we have the ability to work in tight flow.<br/>It seeks to know our products and to prove what we in the stomach. Basically, YOU HAVE FUN. For this, we need you, finally you who read these words, here are some explanations:<br/>Nice graphics worth a thousand words<br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>About rendered.<br/>Our reports are 3D files such a document to print, send it directly to our partners subcontractor.<br/>With 3D modeling and few calculations, we can know the weight, size loan millimeter, mechanisms, mistakes not to make in design such as materials to use.<br/><br/>Build a prototype is very expensive, in the machining machine takes time to set up, and labor to perform, so the monies, lots of money, especially in France.<br/><br/>Through IndieGoGo we can drown in the prototype series of commands and allow us to display these prices defying any competition.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463804193/duofanless_vduw94.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>What do we do during the harvest of funds?<br/>Your purchase is stored on the account until IndieGoGo days -J.<br/>Meanwhile at Pandoradvanced, we charge consolidate all purchases and prepare the packaging of the box.<br/><br/>If you play the game, we will sell you the dream!<br/><br/><br/>If the campaign does not reach its objectives?<br/>We opt for a flexible funding if the targets are not met, you will still have your contribution.<br/><br/>Our goal is to sell the Crimson housing via IndieGoGo and brand awareness thanks to your positive feedback.<br/>We are not trying to inject money in our company, our reputation depends on it.<br/><br/>

Vous connaissez la marque Pandoradvanced
Bienvenu à vous qui nous suivez depuis le début, vous êtes là pour en savoir plus sur le Crimson, je vous invite à descendre plus bas.Vous ne connaissez pas la marque Pandoradvanced
Je suis Christopher Fernandes, ou Kriss. En 2014 je réalisais mes premières créations, puis de fils en aiguilles j'ai tissé un petit commerce.Aujourd'hui, nous sommes des créateurs fous au nombres de deux, le design est notre passion et nous cherchons l'innovation dans l'informatique jours après jours, et si vous êtes la sans même nous connaître, c'est qu'une photo à attirer votre attention.Je vous invite à découvrir notre site internet en suivant les liens et surtout à nous suivre sur Facebook.

Motivation
Après le colossal projet du Jetblack : Bureau et Ordinateur, nous avons eu quelques demandes pour un boitier d'ordinateur Pandoradvanced.

                                                       Jetblack de Pandoradvanced - Boitier & Bureau


 Je me suis donc lancé le défi de dessiner et de créer avec Pandoradvanced un boitier innovant.

Pourquoi un crowdfounding?C'est très simple, voici un tout petit aperçu des charges:
Stockage des marchandises 
Local
Salariés
Charges patronale
Déplacements
Électricités

Téléphones
Licence des logiciels
Dépôts de modèles

Prototypages
Etc, etc..


Un fonctionnement classique d'entreprise me direz-vous? A la différence que nous proposons un produit de luxe à faible marge.Qu'est ce que ça vous y gagnez?En utilisant Indiegogo nous avons la capacité de travailler en flux tendu.On cherche à faire connaitre nos produits et prouver ce qu'on à dans le ventre. En gros, VOUS FAIRE PLAISIR. Pour cela, nous avons besoins de vous, enfin de toi, qui 
lis ces mots, voici quelques explications:Un beau graphisme vaux mieux qu'un long discours


A propos des rendus.Nos rendus sont des fichiers 3D, comme un document à imprimer, on les envoient directement à nos partenaires sous traitant. Grâce à la modélisation 3D et quelques calculs, on peux connaître le poids, la taille au millimètre prêt, les mécanismes, les erreurs à ne pas commettre en conception tels que les matériaux à utiliser.Fabriquer un prototype est très couteux, dans l'usinage une machine prend du temps à configurer, et de la main d’œuvre à exécuter, donc de l'argents, beaucoup d'argent, surtout en France.Grâce à IndieGoGo nous pouvons noyer le prototype dans des commandes en séries et nous permettre d'afficher ces tarifs défiant toute concurrences.
Que faisons-nous pendant la récolte des fonds?Votre achat est stocké sur le compte IndieGoGo jusqu'au jours -J.Pendant ce temps chez Pandoradvanced, on se charge de regrouper tout les achats et de préparer le packaging du boitier. Si vous jouez le jeu, on va vous vendre du rêve! Si la campagne n'atteins pas ses objectifs?Nous avons opter pour un financement flexible, si les objectifs ne sont pas atteint, vous aurez quand même vôtre contribution.Nôtre but est de vendre le boitier Crimson via IndieGoGo et de faire connaître la marque grâce à vos retour positif. Nous ne cherchons pas à injecter votre argent dans nôtre entreprise, notre réputation en dépend.

You know the brand PandoradvancedWelcome to you who follow us from the beginning, you are there to learn more about the Crimson, I invite you to go lower.You do not know the brand PandoradvancedI'm Christopher Fernandes, or Kriss. In 2014 I realized my first creations and son of needles I wove a small business.Today we are crazy creators of two numbers, the design is our passion and we seek innovation in the computer day after day, and if you are without even knowing us is a picture to get your attention.I invite you to discover our website by following the links above and to follow us on Facebook.

MotivationAfter the colossal project Jetblack: Office and computer, we had a few requests for an Pandoradvanced computer case.

                                                         Jetblack of Pandoradvanced - Case & Office


 So I challenged to draw and create with innovative Pandoradvanced case.

Why crowdfounding?It's very simple, here is a little overview of loads:  Storage of goods  Local  Employees  employers charges  trips  electrics  phones  Software license  Models deposits  Prototyping  Etc., etc..A classic business operation you say? The difference is that we offer a luxury product with low margin.What is it you win it?Using Indiegogo we have the ability to work in tight flow.It seeks to know our products and to prove what we in the stomach. Basically, YOU HAVE FUN. For this, we need you, finally you who read these words, here are some explanations:Nice graphics worth a thousand words


About rendered.Our reports are 3D files such a document to print, send it directly to our partners subcontractor.With 3D modeling and few calculations, we can know the weight, size loan millimeter, mechanisms, mistakes not to make in design such as materials to use.Build a prototype is very expensive, in the machining machine takes time to set up, and labor to perform, so the monies, lots of money, especially in France.Through IndieGoGo we can drown in the prototype series of commands and allow us to display these prices defying any competition.
What do we do during the harvest of funds?Your purchase is stored on the account until IndieGoGo days -J.Meanwhile at Pandoradvanced, we charge consolidate all purchases and prepare the packaging of the box.If you play the game, we will sell you the dream!If the campaign does not reach its objectives?We opt for a flexible funding if the targets are not met, you will still have your contribution.Our goal is to sell the Crimson housing via IndieGoGo and brand awareness thanks to your positive feedback.We are not trying to inject money in our company, our reputation depends on it.

Did you know that the new iPhone models support fast charging? Apple has officially stated that with fast charging, your iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X can charge up to 50 percent in as few as 30 minutes. However, you would need to pay at least $75 for Apple’s 29W power adapter and a USB-C-to-Lightning cable. This extra $75 is pricey, even when fast charging is necessary. (Read more about this here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208137)Now there’s an option that's BETTER & AFFORDABLE It costs too much to charge your phone quickly, so we developed a Qualcomm QC adapter-compatible cable to save you money and time.  With C-Force, you can charge the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X up to 50 percent in 30 minutes, compared to 22 percent in 30 minutes with the Apple charging cable. Start charging your new iPhone faster with 9V 1.8 A. Get hours of additional battery life during the day, even if you only plug in your phone for a short period.

LDR 6033 smart chips scale the current of your mobile device to determine whether or not your device supports fast charging. This patent-pending high-tech system can protect your device against overcharging. In addition, C-Force will reduce its charge speed in the last 25 percent to avoid damaging the battery of your mobile device.When charging with the pack-in gear, here are data regarding charging with the C-Force pack-in gear:If you want a faster charge but don’t want to pay over $75 for Apple’s charging cable, you have another option.Use Qualcomm QC adapters and the C-Force cable instead of Apple’s overpriced PD adapter and USB-C-to-Lightning cable.The C-Force cable is a good investment if your phone needs a quick charge in the morning before work, or if you need to boost your iPhone in the middle of the day.  C-Force allows your phone to intelligently scale the amount of power it receives based on the current charge state of its battery. C-Force has two different lights to let you know which type of charge your device is receiving: a blue light during quick charging, and a white light during regular charging. With the new LDR 6033 smart chip technology and LED indicator, it is safe to charge your old iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices as well (including devices older than the iPhone 8). C-Force consists of bend-resistant nylon braiding.

More than a half size can be saved to make your travel more easy and enjoyable. In comparison with other conventional phone gimbals  Small but powerfulATOM weighs only 440 gram (15.5 oz), so your arms won’t get so tired even after a long shoot.Motors in conventional phone gimbals are not big in order to keep a relatively small size and light weight, and normally those gimbals just have a payload around 220 gram.If they want to increase the payload, they would have to make the motors larger, at the price of sacrificing the using experience due to the larger size and heavier weight.  Thanks to the ATOM’s unique structure, ATOM can reach a high payload of 310 gram which is presently the highest in phone gimbal category, without the need to use larger and heavier motors and the body remains light weight and compact size.  Multifunctional Buttons on the Handle ATOM's handle gathers a rich set of buttons that you can use to control almost all the functions of the gimbal and Snoppa App. And almost all the shooting operations can be done with one hand.Even if you don't have Snoppa App, you can use most of the buttons on the handle. As long as your phone’s Bluetooth is connected to Atom, the buttons on the handle can control your phone to shoot or stop. Front control panel   Back side  control Flexible Tracking ModesAccording to different contexts, you can easily adjust the motion sensitivity of Atom. The three tracking modes can be switched with just one button.  1 . Smooth movement in normal mode2. Hold the trigger button to instantly lock the orientation to ensure the footage is stable3. Click and hold the trigger button to set the gimbal into the fast track mode for tracking fast moving objects 
 
 One-Key switch between horizontal and vertical orientationFor all other conventional structure gimbals, changing between horizontal and vertical shooting is a troublesome and time-consuming process.Thanks to ATOM’s unique structure, changing the shooting orientation had never been so easy and fast.You can change the orientation both by one-key click (setup in the app), or rotate it manually. Zoom & Focus controlThe ATOM integrates plenty of control buttons, including a customizable slide button on the side. In the app you can freely define the slide button with zoom or focus function as per your need. Zoom Control Focus control Face track & Object track Unrestricted Heading RotationAtom uses a heading motor that can be rotated without infinity. There’s no dead angles when shooting dynamic time-lapse video. When performing face tracking or object tracking, there is no need to worry about the target exceeding the rotation range of the gimbal. Wonderful App FeaturesWith the dedicated app, people can get more gimbal controls and shooting methods A Mic Interface for Third-party MicrophonesGreat movies have memorable sounds. That’s why Atom creatively built in a mic interface for third-party microphones. This can efficiently improve the audio quality for interviews, live streaming and live shooting. Action camera supportThe ATOM is mainly designed for phone filming, but it also can be used for action cameras like GoPro Hero 4, 5, 6 series.There’re two ways to mount the GoPro1Mount with an adapter2. Mount directly onto the phone holder Protect your phone carefully Typical problems in the conventional 3-axis phone gimbal All the ordinary 3-axis phone gimbals use the orthogonal structure, and have two typical problems:1. Mounting the phone is quite troublesome and time-consuming that people need to balance the phone before startup by adjusting the motor arm.2. The side motor would hide the phone’s charging port (and sometimes the mic port too) How does the Atom behave On ATOM, we creatively invent a non-orthogonal structure with the oblique arm. In this unique structure, the side motor will not hit the bottom of the phone any more and leaves the phone a large movement space. Supports Wireless/wired Phone ChargingAtom is equipped with wired charging and wireless charging, which allows you shoot without worrying about dead battery after shooting. Atom can easily charge your phone with wireless charging. You can even start to charge midway through the shooting, without any interruption. If your phone does not support wireless charging, Atom’s wired charging is outstanding as well. You might think if the phone mounting and gimbal stabilization would be affected by the charging cable. Let me tell you something, thanks to its unique structural design, Atom can perfectly avoid these problems. Super Long RuntimeAtom battery runs up to 24 hours. You can easily handle demands of continuous filming during a long journey or a long filming hours even when you are away from a power source. Thoughtful detailsIn addition to the unique exciting features, the ATOM also have a lot of thoughtful details which help to get a better user experience.There’s a lock on each motor arm, which can prevent the arm from moving around when the gimbal is closed. Some mobile phones have keys in the middle part of the side, which could easily cause problem when attach the phone to the gimbal phone holder.ATOM effectively solve this issue by designing a slot in the rubber griper. On the back of the phone holder, there’s a slot on the upper and lower part respectively. In this way user can pull out the phone holder much easier. With the dedicated app, people can get more gimbal controls and shooting methods  SPECIFICATIONS   SHARE WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY!    OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES 110° Wide angle lens

<p><strong><span>Have you guys been sick of these problems?</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wired HDMI connection works great, but running cables all over the place to connect devices is inconvenient and unsightly.</li>
<li>Ordinary wireless casting solutions often require Wi-Fi, which commonly results in lagging video and delayed audio.</li>
<li>Cross-operation systems or cross-platform casting is never easy to achieve, creating compatibility problems and making streaming a closed ecosystem like what Amazon, Google, and Roku provide. Not to mention the many applications that need to be installed.</li>
<li>My traditional, non-smart screens like TVs, monitors, and projectors still have value and deserve a powerful upgrade rather than breaking the bank for an expensive “smart TV”.<br/> </li>

Check Out This Unboxing & Hands-On By Unbox Fantasy 
 

 
See How HYPER MIRROR Works In Action, Please Refer To The ""Demo Video"" Section Below. 
 
 

 
 
 
Have you guys been sick of these problems?

Wired HDMI connection works great, but running cables all over the place to connect devices is inconvenient and unsightly.
Ordinary wireless casting solutions often require Wi-Fi, which commonly results in lagging video and delayed audio.
Cross-operation systems or cross-platform casting is never easy to achieve, creating compatibility problems and making streaming a closed ecosystem like what Amazon, Google, and Roku provide. Not to mention the many applications that need to be installed.
My traditional, non-smart screens like TVs, monitors, and projectors still have value and deserve a powerful upgrade rather than breaking the bank for an expensive “smart TV”. 

 
Now, all of those issues are no longer a problem. Introducing the streaming myth loop breaker - HYPER MIRROR, the world’s only Zero Lag, Off Wi-Fi, No App, cinema-quality screen mirroring device that is perfect for large screen gaming, video conference, movie watching and social media browsing. With HYPER MIRROR you can truly enjoy the convenience of plug & play wireless streaming to any HDMI screens, such as TVs, monitors, projectors, and more. You name it, we link it. 

 
 
 
No more messy cabling, no more frustrating gaming experiences on a tiny screen, no more internet prerequisites, HYPER MIRROR works like a charm for any viewing need. 
 
 
HYPER MIRROR utilizes the industrial leading mm-Wave (AKA EHF) technology that is normally found in 5G networks. Compared with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi streaming, EHF allows more content transmission at faster speed with a more stable connection and ultimately higher quality. How Fast?  For the first time in the consumer market, almost No Latency. How good in quality? Professional gamers say “hurray!”.   
 
 
 
Never spend another second waiting for connection or app installations. Wireless gaming with Zero lag and crystal clear, sharp images for a more enjoyable and smooth, perfectly synced casting experience. 
 
 
 
Connect multiple devices to one screen wirelessly with just one-click to switch between output signals. Embrace the freedom of a no cable lifestyle. HYPER MIRROR is a more convenient way to cast any content to a larger screen. 
 
 
 
There are no limitations on the media you wish to cast, HYPER MIRROR supports all types of streaming sources. It’s your best companion for both work and leisure.  
 
 

 
 
Simple Two Steps
Does not require any Wi-Fi connection. Patented mm-Wave technology allows you to wirelessly plug and play it whenever, wherever, and on any devices you like.
 

 Works Cross-Platforms  
 
 
 
 
 
Just simply connect it to your smartphone, laptop, or tablet. Instantly upgrade any traditional TV, monitor, or projector to a smart screen with HYPER MIRROR. It saves you from buying a gimmicky smart TV.

</p><p>
</p><p>Coffee prices have been falling for the past 3 years to an
historically low, due to many factors, specially the stagnated demand, as a
consequence of the economic crisis in consuming countries, and over production,
in particular by countries as Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, which are by far
the 3 top producers in the world, with a total of about 90 million bags. 90% of the world production is channelized thru top exporters, transnational corporations, international traders/brokers and big importers, leaving to the coffee growers only 5% (about $ 1.20/pound) on the final price of the product they grow, with so much hard work and economic effort. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/293982/files/20140106093702-2013-14_crop_in_Espirito_Santo_do_Pinhal__Sao_Paulo__Brazil.jpg?1389029822"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>All
coffee growers are suffering now, however for small growers (in some countries 80%), especially the
ones in Central America, the situation is particularly difficult as,
besides the low current prices, they had to overcome the Coffee Leaf Rust
plague (Roya) as well, which, in many areas, has decimated the coffee bushes
population. Therefore, producers in these regions are facing a terrible
economical disaster, as most of them depend exclusively on coffee and they are
getting lower pay, for smaller crop and higher production costs, for 3 years in
a raw now.  As if all this was not enough, they are
facing another 2 or 3 years of price crisis, where 40% of the small growers are
at risk of going out of business, hence putting the Central American coffee on
the fast line to extinction.</p>

Coffee prices have been falling for the past 3 years to an
historically low, due to many factors, specially the stagnated demand, as a
consequence of the economic crisis in consuming countries, and over production,
in particular by countries as Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, which are by far
the 3 top producers in the world, with a total of about 90 million bags. 90% of the world production is channelized thru top exporters, transnational corporations, international traders/brokers and big importers, leaving to the coffee growers only 5% (about $ 1.20/pound) on the final price of the product they grow, with so much hard work and economic effort. All
coffee growers are suffering now, however for small growers (in some countries 80%), especially the
ones in Central America, the situation is particularly difficult as,
besides the low current prices, they had to overcome the Coffee Leaf Rust
plague (Roya) as well, which, in many areas, has decimated the coffee bushes
population. Therefore, producers in these regions are facing a terrible
economical disaster, as most of them depend exclusively on coffee and they are
getting lower pay, for smaller crop and higher production costs, for 3 years in
a raw now.  As if all this was not enough, they are
facing another 2 or 3 years of price crisis, where 40% of the small growers are
at risk of going out of business, hence putting the Central American coffee on
the fast line to extinction.

Our Solution


Knowledge and Information have always been Power
and if combined with the proper Tools,
at one click away, to help you reach thousands of potential buyers around
the world, it is Freedom as well. In recent years most countries have
experienced a boom in wireless
communication, making internet accessible even in the most remote areas.
Therefore, we warmly invite You all, to help us democratize
and make the Coffee Trade accessible to millions of growers around the
world, by building an Independent Coffee Trade Platform meant to
host a truly Free and Open Market, based on offer and demand only. Let’s
build together the infrastructure needed to move forward with the Coffee
Trade Revolution, which will potentially give economic freedom to 25 million coffee
growers around the world, giving them the opportunity to trade
their coffee directly, cutting out the middle men and hence getting a higher
share of the final price.



Our experienced team, with over 50 years in the international coffee trade,
allied to one of the best IT packages, aims to bring together producers,
exporters, traders, importers & roasters in a platform where they can
professionally conduct their day to day business. Having already
established one of the most sophisticated IT infrastructures offered by any
coffee broker, YouTradeCoffee is currently working on the next
phase of is ‘grand design’, which
will take the form of new software tools for B2B International Coffee
Trade, that ultimately will cut out the intermediary from the
commercialization chain. It is a solution meant to inform and empower
particularly the small and middle sized producers and roasters,
but at the same time functioning as a powerful tool for the mainstream coffee
trade as well. At YTC platform you will be able to buy,
sell or auction coffee 24/7, sign contracts & track your trade
operations online, in a secure, organized, transparent, professional and
comfortable environment. Besides all of this you can ask for professional
consultancy/assistance regarding international coffee trade matters, read daily
Coffee News & Market Reports, consult the Weather,
Currencies, daily NY""C"" & LIFFE Chart & Quotes,
Knowledge Center and much more.
You, our supporters, have always been the core of YouTradeCoffee (YTC). Together we have always believed that we can make a
difference and will we make a difference, therefore we warmly invite you to be part of the Coffee Trade Revolution in order to finally empower the Coffee Growers, which are being paid less than 5% on the end price of the product they grow, and at the same time you’re helping us to continue informing you in a transparent and independent way.



     Read The Latest Coffee News In English, Spanish, Portuguese & Many OtherThis has been a 14 years “work in progress” for us and today, as we end one chapter of YTC history, we look forward to a new chapter with hope and excitement. We recently started to build the new project, the only Coffee Specialized News & B2B Trade Platform. A space that YTC members can proudly call their “All in 1 Business Center”, their own professional and personalized “WebOffice”, where they will continue to receive the latest news the way we have always done it, independent & unfiltered, while conducting and tracking their trade activities in a professional but “UserFriendly” environment.                               Reach Out To Your End Buyer – Place a Coffee Offer
We
plan to have the very first YTC Beta Coffee Trading
Platform online & running by 08 March 2014 and we would
love to build it together, therefore we will make sure to keep you updated of
our progress, step by step! To build from the ground up a professional B2B
Coffee Trading Platform and help financing the first year of operation we
need over $60,000. We recognize this is a significant amount but we are
excited that we can surely make history and change the way coffee is
traded worldwide. We will start by coding the coffee auction platform. We
strive to code a Coffee Auction Platform so Accessible &
UserFriendly that small growers could create auctions, to directly
market and finally sell their specialty micro lots to the highest bidder on the
international market, while keeping updated with the latest news, market reports and many
other!
Auction Your Coffee & Sell It To The Highest BidderWe want you to be a part of every element in this new platform. We realize this is no small amount but every small amount matters. We will acknowledge it was YOU who helped us build this and we sincerely appreciate it. Everyone who chips in will be commemorated on our website so that we can proudly announce that we built it together. As a gesture of appreciation for your kind support, we have some interesting and exiting perks for you, like free YTC memberships, gourmet coffee from Costa Rica, Nicaragua or Colombia, we will feature your company or estate to thousands of buyers/sellers worldwide thru YouTradeCoffee Platform and social media, with banners and/or other marketing tools, trips to visit Coffee Estates, Natural Reserves and Tropical Beaches in Nicaragua, Costa Rica or Colombia and many other surprises, contests and much more………Our Directors have been involved in every aspect of the coffee trade, from

We hope everything will be all right and that you get to play with your Enfojer by February 2014. That leaves us with a lot of manouvering time, in case something does not go according to production plan. No worries, we know how to handle those. We learned it in the last year and a half.<br/><br/><p><b>FAQ<br/></b></p>
<p><b>1. Can you develop color prints? </b></p>
<p>No. Developing color prints is a lot more complicated, demanding and 
chemically complex process. It is seriously toxic too, so we do not 
think it should be done at home for reasons of safety and health. </p>
<p><b>2. Which chemicals should you get and where do you get them? </b></p>
<p>We recommend ILFORD MULTIGRADE DEVELOPER or PQ UNIVERSAL 
in combination with ILFORD RAPID FIXER. You can get these in your local 
photo equipment store or just order them online. Of course, if you can't
 get Ilford, there are others. Experiment is half of the fun with 
Enfojer. </p>
<p><b>3. What lens are we using in the Enfojer?</b></p>
<p>It is a wide angle polycarbonate toy camera style meniscus lens. It 
blurs the image just right so you don't see the pixels on your print. 
Yeah, we tried sharper and better ones, but the results were too 
sterile. </p>
<p><b>4. How much room you need for a darkroom? </b></p>
<p>Any room that can be completely dark can be a darkroom. Bathrooms 
tend to be perfect as they have smaller windows or none at all and 
running water. You need running water (or a large bucket). Garages, 
basement storage rooms…any space you can isolate from light. </p>
<p>You don't need a lot of space, as the Enfojer takes 283 mm x 260 mm, 
trays in our rack take 290 x 370 mm, or each tray on it's own is 285 x 
285 mm. So you need at least a 60 cm up to a meter of level surface. 
Anything more is darkroom luxury. </p>
<p><b>5. What is the light source for printing out of negative films? </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your phones bright LED screen. It's enough. </p>
<p><b>6. What materials are used in Enfojer production?</b></p>
<p>Base and tray rack are made out of anodized aluminum. Enfojer 
itself is mainly glass-reinforced polyamide, ultra high quality durable 
plastic. Tongs and trays are made out of lighter and softer plastics, to
 lower the cost of manufacture and make them more functional. </p>
<p><b>7. How long does it take to make a print, altogether? </b></p>
<p>Once you have everything setup, from phone to finished print it takes exactly 6 minutes. </p>
<p><b>8. Why do you have to use the red light?</b></p>
<p>Mostly because it would be darn difficult working in the dark. Red light is used because majority of black-and-white papers is sensitive to blue, or blue and green light. Reds do not expose the paper. </p>
