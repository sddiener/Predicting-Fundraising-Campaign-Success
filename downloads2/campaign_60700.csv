My Husband, Adam, and I have been together for over 12 years and started trying

We have been through a gamut of testing including blood tests, sperm

In an effort to leave no stone unturned, Adam and I are at our last resort:

possible.  My eggs are not getting any
younger.  Time is not on our side so we
need to get this show on the road.
I was
referred to the CNY in New York by my midwife in Colorado.  She suggested that they work with couples who
are struggling with infertility but who have limited financial resources.    Our plan is to do 1 IVF cycle in February
of 2012.  

The Impact


We are humbly asking for
help.  Given 2 mortgages, my husbandâ€™s inconsistent work in the
construction industry, we have not been able to save as much as we would have
liked.  In preparing for IVF it became
clear that we can't afford it alone.  But
it also became clear that there are others, just like us, who are struggling
immensely to afford this procedure, and who dream day after day of holding a
child in their arms.  It is such a defeating place to be when youâ€™re told
you canâ€™t have the one thing you wish for the most. Money should be no object in
obtaining life.  Yet it is an undeniable object. People say you can't put

they will laugh at you through their frustrated tears. If you've ever had an
empty place in your life and your heart you cannot fill, and that you
unwillingly have to accept, then you have a whiff of what it's like to struggle
with infertility.  
So we
came here.  In raising funds for our own
procedure we are also hoping to help others in need.  We know that this is
just the beginning, that children cost money, hospital bills are expensive, not
to mention all the needs that a child has.  But if you can't conceive then
you can't get to those places.  I would happily worry about all of those
next steps if we could just be blessed with a child.  And I know so many
other women who feel the same way. We desire the morning sickness, the stretch
marks, the sleepless nights, the pickles and ice cream cravings!  We long to look at a little one and have our
hearts melt.  We just need a jumpstart
financially to give us renewed hope and a better chance at pregnancy.  Therefore, I'm hoping that the impact of this
campaign will be far-reaching.  It will make something priceless possible
that would otherwise be impossible: life.   



What We Need & What You Get
The entire procedure will cost us approximately $15K including air 
fare, medication, hotel, and time off work.  We are prepared to 
contribute everything we have so are asking for a minimum of $6000 to get us started.  However, I would also love

procedure 
possible for us or through another center for reproductive medicine to assist couples in need.  
Therefore, we have come up with the following structure of funds received to be able to give to others as well as fund our own cycle: 
 
If
 we receive $6,500-$7,000 then we will give 10%, if we receive $7,001-$8,000
 
then we will give 20%, if we receive $8,001-$9,000 then we will give 
25% and anything over $10,000 we will donate 30% of the funds received.

become unable to properly absorb gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the amino
acid that regulates muscle tone in humans. Without GABA absorption to those
particular nerve rootlets, affected nerves (in this case, the ones controlling
the legs) perpetually fire the message for their corresponding muscles to
permanently, rigidly contract, and the muscles become permanently hypertonic.</font></font></span></p><p></p><p></p>

</font></div>","About My Illness!


Hi my name is Rick. I was
born with a form of Cerebral Palsy (CP) called Spastic Diplegia.  Spastic Diplegia is a neuromuscular condition of hypertonia and spasticity in the
muscles of the lower extremities of the human body, usually those of the legs,
hips and pelvis.  Spastic diplegia's
particular type of brain damage inhibits the proper development of upper motor
neuron function, impacting the motor cortex, the basal ganglia and the
corticospinal tract. Nerve receptors in the spine leading to affected muscles
become unable to properly absorb gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the amino
acid that regulates muscle tone in humans. Without GABA absorption to those
particular nerve rootlets, affected nerves (in this case, the ones controlling
the legs) perpetually fire the message for their corresponding muscles to
permanently, rigidly contract, and the muscles become permanently hypertonic.


The abnormally high
muscle tone that results creates lifelong difficulty with all voluntary and
passive movement in the legs, and generally creates stress over time â€”
depending on the severity of the condition in the individual, the constant
spasticity ultimately produces pain, muscle/joint breakdown including
tendinitis and arthritis, premature physical exhaustion (i.e., becoming
physically exhausted even when you internally know that you have more energy
than you are able to use), contractures, spasms, and progressively worse
deformities/mis-alignments of bone structure around areas of the tightened
musculature as the person's years progress.


About
Me!


In 2000 I started to have less
control of my body. Each day daily tasks become much more
difficult for me to accomplish such as brushing my teeth, getting dressed,
taking a shower, cleaning and cooking.


In July of 2009 over a 3 day
period I went from walking with a cane to being paralyzed and unable to
do anything for myself, I couldnâ€™t even speak to communicate what was wrong
with me.  I was in the hospital for 3
months and then moved to a rehabilitation center for 4 months.  


What
I need!


I estimate that my ultimate financial need will be
around $10,000. This will pay for the treatments that are not covered by
insurance such as:


Â·        
Amen Clinics, Inc. (ACI), in Virginia, has amassed the worldâ€™s largest databases of
functional brain (SPECT) scans. In his experience scans were clinically helpful
in understanding ADHD, anxiety, depression, autism, Aspergers Syndrome,
learning disabilities, dyslexia, traumatic brain injuries, dementia,
Alzheimerâ€™s, addictions, substance abuse, violence, suicidal behavior, marital
conflicts, work problems, behavior disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar and other
brain related diseases. 


Â·        
Wheel chair will
enable me to get around the hospitals for my treatment.


              Physical therapy to get
me back to the state I was prior to the 2000 episode.


Â·        
Over $10,000 in
past due medical bills not covered by insurance.

<p>This year, approximately six hundred thousand Americans, and more than 7 million humans around the world, will die of cancer. In the United States, one in three women and one in two men will develop cancer during their lifetime. A quarter of all American deaths, and about 15 percent of all deaths worldwide, will be attributed to cancer. In some nations, cancer will surpass heart disease to become the most common cause of death.” (from The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, by S. Mukherjee.</p>

<p>In one of the first experiments dealing with the discovery of the CKA in 1999, a group of mice were injected with mouse sarcoma cancer cells, a highly lethal form of mouse soft tissue cancer cells, with an expectation that all the injected mice should develop cancerous ascites or liquid tumors and die.  However, one male mouse, unlike all others, failed to develop these chemical tumors and remained healthy after repeated challenges with these lethal cancer cells. After subsequent re-testing to rule out possibilities of technical error, it was realized that this unexpected mouse possessed the innate ability to resist even the most lethal injections of cancerous cells.</p>

<p>Also are there humans that exist with this type of cancer immunity?  The answer is also <strong>yes.</strong> </p>
<p>One apparent question is then whether cancer-resistant humans as donors can be found to test a similar cancer treatment via allogenic white cell transfer.  Using a newly developed <em>in vitro</em> assay to measure white cell’s ability to kill various target cancer cell lines, we surveyed human volunteers and found a significant number of healthy humans having the CKA very similar to that of cancer-resistant mice.  There is a bell-shaped distribution of CKA in the population of healthy humans.  The CKA average seems to be lower in older human population and to be even lower in human cancer patients. The CKA can also be abolished by stress and change of seasons.  Based on these findings and the ability to screen for cancer-resistant humans as allogenic, white blood cell donors, we proposed a new cancer treatment strategy, termed “<strong>G.I.F.T.</strong>”(<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">G</span></strong>ranulocyte <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I</span></strong>n<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">F</span></strong>usion <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">T</span></strong>herapy.</p>

<p>**********************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Hello! My name is Jessica, and that's me before part of my head was shaved and I lost almost 40 pounds. But let me back up just a little bit. In early February 2013 I was stricken with a disease called Chiari Malformation. It’s not like cancer or most of the diseases that every one knows about or can personally relate to, so let me give you a little background info...</p>
<p>During skull development, the area that contains the back part of my brain didn’t grow as large as necessary. So once my brain finished growing, it ended up being too big for my skull. Since the skull isn’t the most flexible thing in the body, the only place for the cerebellum to go is into the spinal canal. This puts pressure on the brainstem, spine, and in turn, the cerebellum. This causes debilitating neurological signs such as paralyzing head and neck pain, dizziness and balance issues, loss of sensation in the arms, loss of fine motor control, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, nausea, etc. which only get progressively worse without treatment.</p>
<p>Although it's a condition I was born with, symptoms often do not present until the late 20s. That's exactly when it hit me hard and fast and my only option was immediate surgery to remove a portion of my skull and spinal vertebrae to make room for my giant brain. The cost of that alone would have been quite a hardship, but my story doesn’t end there.</p>
<p>A few weeks after surgery, I began leaking spinal fluid and was admitted to the hospital with bacterial meningitis and underwent a second brain surgery. Almost everything that could go wrong did. I developed severe infections and a wound that stil to this day, just won’t heal. My eye was also damaged in surgery due to an anesthetic complication which caused pain and decreased vision. I developed esophageal thrush and couldn’t eat for weeks. After an extended hospital stay, I was released into home healthcare where I am now receiveing intensive IV therapy 4 times daily along with physical therapy and wound care.</p>
<p>When this occurred, I was just barely into my first year as a new veterinarian. I was already drowning in student loan debt just trying to follow my dream. Who knew a veterinary education could cost upwards of a quarter of a million dollars and leave you with 12% interest rates? I guess I did, but I wasn't about to give up on a dream I’ve had since kindergarten. I was never in it for the money and I was barely squeaking by, but still I was very happy with my life and my job. Now I know it’s a little harder to say money doesn’t matter when you have none. I had no savings, no money leftover after my monthy bills, and no backup plan, so this hit me and my family hard.</p>
<p>I have health insurance (not the greatest, but still very grateful for it), but the cost of living, the student loans, the medical bills – it’s overwhelming to say the least. It's incredibly difficult for me to overcome my pride and post this. I’m not the type to ask for a hand out and have always been extremely independent, probably to a fault, but these past few months have taught me to depend on the kindness of others. This situation is no longer affecting just me, but also my dear parents who should be enjoying retirement instead of trying to keep debt collectors from destroying my credit before I even get started, all because I just don't have enough money. They now have the burden of physically and finacially taking care of both my autistic older sister and I. So much for the kids moving out at 18. Since we've learned with my sister that disability is a huge joke, there just simply is no money and no way that I have found so far to get it.</p>
<p>I know some of you might not know me, but now you know my story. If you have the money to spare, I can’t even explain the difference it would make. I’m a strong believer in paying it forward. Prior to my medical setbacks I was a regular supporter of Susan G. Komen, SPCA, Special Olympics, a frequent animal rescuer and animal foster parent, and did veterinary pro-bono – I fully continue to support these causes one day when I get back on my feet. I thank you so much for even reading this and if you are able to contribute, my heart goes out to you in gratitude..</p>

Even though we have accomplished our first goal of $5,000 please continue to read and share my story. 
 I set my goal low due to limitations of this campaign, as I never expected to reach my goal and this website discourages unrealistic goals. 
My actual medical costs are much closer to $20,000. 
I truly thought that $5,000 was unattainable, and I am overwhelmed that we have surpassed it. I would just like to remind everyone to please – even though my goal is “fulfilled” at $5,000 this campaign allows us to exceed that amount. Please read my story, and continue to share and contribute if you possibly can.
**********************************************************************************************************
Hello! My name is Jessica, and that's me before part of my head was shaved and I lost almost 40 pounds. But let me back up just a little bit. In early February 2013 I was stricken with a disease called Chiari Malformation. It’s not like cancer or most of the diseases that every one knows about or can personally relate to, so let me give you a little background info...
During skull development, the area that contains the back part of my brain didn’t grow as large as necessary. So once my brain finished growing, it ended up being too big for my skull. Since the skull isn’t the most flexible thing in the body, the only place for the cerebellum to go is into the spinal canal. This puts pressure on the brainstem, spine, and in turn, the cerebellum. This causes debilitating neurological signs such as paralyzing head and neck pain, dizziness and balance issues, loss of sensation in the arms, loss of fine motor control, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, nausea, etc. which only get progressively worse without treatment.
Although it's a condition I was born with, symptoms often do not present until the late 20s. That's exactly when it hit me hard and fast and my only option was immediate surgery to remove a portion of my skull and spinal vertebrae to make room for my giant brain. The cost of that alone would have been quite a hardship, but my story doesn’t end there.
A few weeks after surgery, I began leaking spinal fluid and was admitted to the hospital with bacterial meningitis and underwent a second brain surgery. Almost everything that could go wrong did. I developed severe infections and a wound that stil to this day, just won’t heal. My eye was also damaged in surgery due to an anesthetic complication which caused pain and decreased vision. I developed esophageal thrush and couldn’t eat for weeks. After an extended hospital stay, I was released into home healthcare where I am now receiveing intensive IV therapy 4 times daily along with physical therapy and wound care.
When this occurred, I was just barely into my first year as a new veterinarian. I was already drowning in student loan debt just trying to follow my dream. Who knew a veterinary education could cost upwards of a quarter of a million dollars and leave you with 12% interest rates? I guess I did, but I wasn't about to give up on a dream I’ve had since kindergarten. I was never in it for the money and I was barely squeaking by, but still I was very happy with my life and my job. Now I know it’s a little harder to say money doesn’t matter when you have none. I had no savings, no money leftover after my monthy bills, and no backup plan, so this hit me and my family hard.
I have health insurance (not the greatest, but still very grateful for it), but the cost of living, the student loans, the medical bills – it’s overwhelming to say the least. It's incredibly difficult for me to overcome my pride and post this. I’m not the type to ask for a hand out and have always been extremely independent, probably to a fault, but these past few months have taught me to depend on the kindness of others. This situation is no longer affecting just me, but also my dear parents who should be enjoying retirement instead of trying to keep debt collectors from destroying my credit before I even get started, all because I just don't have enough money. They now have the burden of physically and finacially taking care of both my autistic older sister and I. So much for the kids moving out at 18. Since we've learned with my sister that disability is a huge joke, there just simply is no money and no way that I have found so far to get it.
I know some of you might not know me, but now you know my story. If you have the money to spare, I can’t even explain the difference it would make. I’m a strong believer in paying it forward. Prior to my medical setbacks I was a regular supporter of Susan G. Komen, SPCA, Special Olympics, a frequent animal rescuer and animal foster parent, and did veterinary pro-bono – I fully continue to support these causes one day when I get back on my feet. I thank you so much for even reading this and if you are able to contribute, my heart goes out to you in gratitude..
If you can't contribute, get the word out! Share my story. Post me on your Facebook account! Twitter, YouTube, even Google+ or MySpace (I think 1 or 2 people might still be using it?). Social media can be very powerful and I've seen it do great things for those who need it :)
And learn about Chiari Malformation. It effects 1 in 1000 (possibly more since it's only diagnosed by MRI). Educate yourself and others. I fully intend to contribute to Chiari Awareness and help others like myself once I'm medically and finacially able to rejoin the world.

<p>Following the recent massacre of school children, the limited access to effective mental health services has emerged as a glaring problem. Many of us feel upset and helpless, and wish there was something we could do. <em><strong>We can do something now, that matters, that will make a difference.</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the best ways to break the cycle of violence is to get traumatized kids the effective therapy they need. Then they heal from the trauma, have better lives, and are much less likely to hurt others. <a href=""http://www.childtrauma.com/pc.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Progressive Counting (PC)</a> is on track to make trauma therapy better, quicker, and more accessible -- pending further research. This project will move the research a major step forward.</p>
<p>The two leading trauma treatments for children are TF-CBT (trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy) and EMDR (eye movement desensitization &amp; reprocessing). TF-CBT is good, but slow: it can take from several to a dozen therapy sessions just to heal from a single trauma memory, and some children can't tolerate going through one trauma memory after another for months on end. EMDR is more efficient (typically only 1-3 sessions per trauma memory) but it's complicated and hard to get good at, so the training is long and expensive. Many therapists who want EMDR training can't afford it, and many who get the training don't use it properly.</p>
<p>PC combines the best features of each. It's as easy to learn as TF-CBT, and in <a href=""http://www.childtrauma.com/pubpcemdr.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the first comparison study</a> (with adults), PC was as efficient and effective as EMDR. PC has been used successfully with many children and teens, but has not yet been directly compared to another child trauma treatment. If the research confirms PC as effective, efficient, and easy to learn, it will represent a significant advance in child trauma treatment. Then more therapists will learn and use PC, and <em><strong>more children will get the help they need.</strong></em></p>
<p>This controlled comparison of PC and TF-CBT for children and teens is of high scientific quality, featuring randomization, blind/independent assessment, large N (60 kids in each group), large number (30) of participating therapists, etc. Normally this type of study would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but we're using the regular therapists and clients in a busy clinic, so the largest cost -- the actual therapy -- is already covered. (IRB-approved; research design and citations provided <a href=""mailto:cti@childtrauma.com?subject=testing%20PC%20info%20request"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">upon request</a>.)</p>
<p>So why crowd-fund this instead of applying for a normal research grant? Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project is low-budget and crowd-fundable.</li>
<li>It's hard to get grant funding; but this study will open the door to grant funding for subsequent PC research</li>
<li>It can easily take a couple of years from applying for grant funding to starting the project. <em><strong>We can't wait, because children can't wait.</strong></em>
</li>
</ul><h3>Where Your Money Goes</h3>
<p>It'll cost about $3,000 in travel (airfare, parking, hotel, etc.) to get three trainers out to Californa for three days to train the agency's 30 therapists. Another $4,500 to pay the trainers. The host agency, also a nonprofit, needs $4,500 to cover the lost income for the time the staff will be learning PC. There's the $12K we're looking for. Some costs (materials, assessments, data entry) will be taken care of by the host agency.</p>
<p>If we get the $12K we'll do it. If we get less, we'll find some way to do it anyway. And if we're over-funded, don't worry -- there will be substantial additional costs for analyzing the data and writing it up for publication.</p>
<p>This budget is peanuts, considering the scope of the study. In other words, a very good bang for the buck. Your donation goes to my nonprofit org, Child Trauma Institute, so it's tax-deductible. Please do what you can!</p>
<h3>What We're Going to Accomplish</h3>
<p>We'll run the study for about a year to get the targeted number of participants. Then we'll analyze the data, write it up, and publish the paper in a professional journal. If PC does poorly, that's the end of it. But if it does well -- which we believe it will, based on research and clinical observations so far -- then this published study makes a big splash. Therapists get PC training, more studies get done, more therapists get PC training... This is how new treatments become established.</p>
<p>The promise of PC is that it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>well tolerated by clients; even kids can do it</li>
<li>easily mastered by therapists, so training is relatively quick and inexpensive, and therapists will be likely to (a) get the training, and (b) do it properly</li>
<li>efficient, so client suffering is ended more quickly, as is overall treatment</li>
<li>economical in training and treatment, making it more likely for children to be able to access effective trauma therapy</li>
</ul><p>A good therapist heals the world, one person at a time. Good research creates a higher standard of practice, so that the whole community of therapists becomes more efficient and effective. That's what we're going for here. The world's children need a whole lot of healing, and if we can do it quicker, better, and less expensively, we'lll be able to get the healing to a lot more kids.</p>
<p>This may sound grandiose but you're betting on someone with a track record here. I was one of the pioneers in developing and disseminating EMDR for children; I published some of the first studies, provided much of the early training, mentored other trainers, and published the first treatment manual 6 years before the books came out. By now there are more EMDR/child experts than you can shake a stick at, and many thousands of children every year are treated with EMDR. With PC's advantages, PC should do even better, and I'm determined that it will.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you believe that traumatized children should get the help they need, please support this project.</strong></em> Whatever you can offer is just right; of course more is better, but even the small donations help to generate momentum and make this a success.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether or not you're able to put money down, please spread the word! You can do this by using the Indiegogo share tools, sending a note out to your own e-mail list, telling your mother, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, if you happen to have enough frequent flier miles to cover one or more of the trips, wow, that would save us a lot of $! If this is you, please <a href=""mailto:cti@childtrauma.com?subject=testing%20PC%20frequent%20flier%20miles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">let me know</a>.

The pain Paradigm shifts to ""PAIN is now OPTIONAL!!"" You won't need a doctor's note to get rid of your pain at this clinic, as walk-ins are welcome. For severe situation, your pain cannot be taken away by this new method, therefore, you will need to see your doctor.
 3) because something this unique and BIG -- the end to humanity's search for pain treatment -- needs everyone's investment and financial support!
 
 
HOW CAN I KNOW THIS PAIN RELIEF TREATMENT REALLY WORK?
The pain will be reduced within minutes!! You will know, because you can feel the pain subsiding! It's quite miraculous to experience this each and every time!
 ""What if I don't believe this works?""
It doesn't take your belief to make this work!!! (Placebo effect?! Ha! When something works over 50% curative rate, it shouldn't be call a PLACEBO!!) TRY IT, DON'T DENY IT! (The Weight Loss With Ear Beads would be a good start for you!)
 
 
BENEFITS for YOUR INVOLVMENT NOW
For your generosity in funding this clinic from the start, there will be a huge reduction in pricing to the average Americans of 99% discount off $10,000 per treatment to the 99%! Because of YOUR help today, know that your action will help those in pain in the future too.
(""The Internal Revenue Service did report that the wealthiest 1% of taxpayers had an Adjusted Gross Income of $380,000 in 2010. So one way to define the top 1% would be those making more than $400,000."" Okay, let's be generous to the 1%, and forgive one million dollar in assets. So, for those who have 1.4 millions in total asset, including salary, investments, etc., you will not qualify for the 99% discount.)
 
LONGTERM:
It's also a training facility to Special Healthcare Professionals to spread Immediate Pain Relief nationwide within a few years! COMING SOON TO A CITY NEAR YOU!
(My 6-year journey with quickly training someone to take over the Tucson, Denver, Puerto Vallarta, MX. practices failed miserably and made me realize these Professionals need on-going teaching/structural/financial loan support! Holding a seminar is not enough. I need this facility to better train them and nurture their professional growth over time in order to serve Humanity with pain seccession.)
 
 
What Would the $400,000 be Used For?


The money helps offset the FREE PAIN CARE for VETERANS year round!


Rental space in NYC for a street level (wheel chair accessible) clinic so that people in pain don't have to travel much further



Supplies and advertisement costs


Pay the salary of 5 full Time Staff Members ranging from $40k to $85k to operate the clinic 7 days a week

(What would we do with all our profits once the clinic starts? We will HIRE more people, be JOB CREATOR, help open more CLINICS every where, fund Retirement and Bonuses for our Staff, while the CEO will only make $150k a year. All profits will go back into the company and/or spread evenly among the Staff!)
 
  **** 
In addition to Massage, Services Available at our Clinic are:
Miracle #1 = Weight Loss with Ear Beads
Miracle #2 = Anti Stress Bead(s)
Miracle #3 = Immediate Pain Relief (any type of pain)
Miracle #4 = Ultimate Calm (great for PTSD too)

<h3></h3>
<p>I’m sending this out to the world
on behalf of my friend and co-worker Debbie Printz. In 2010, Debbie was
diagnosed with second stage breast cancer. She under went Mastectomy and a
grueling round of chemotherapy. Cancer is a rough road for anyone; Debbie was
especially sick and had to be hospitalized. After which she was forced to stay
home missing a lot of work. Naturally this depleted her savings and also her
leave from work.</p>
<p>Deb is a fighter she fought hard and
was told she was cancer free. Still many of us couldn’t help but notice Debbie constantly
holding her chest. When asked she described it as pain. Her local doctors in
our rural area treated her complaint with an abundance of pain medications; by
taking those medications it made it nearly impossibly for her to work or
function. Whatever was ailing her was clearly getting worse. Fortunately one of
our very savvy co-workers insisted on driving Debbie to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p>After days of testing and weaning
her off the multitudes of pain medication; which had dangerously slowed her
heartbeat forcing the Mayo staff to insert an internal heartbeat monitor to
locate her heartbeat. Next a cat scan was preformed which resulted in another
biopsy after which we had a big part of the answer. Two weeks ago Debbie was
again diagnosed with breast cancer only this time it is stage four. Now there
is a large mass in the center of her chest which doctors believe is the cause
of her pain. There are also three spots on her right lung. Shortly, Debbie will
be undergoing a pet scan to discover if the cancer has metastasized to her
brain. The news came as a harsh blow especially since she has already walked
this path once before. </p>
<p>Debbie is young at only 47, the
mother of three and a good friend. Many of her treatments will be in Phoenix which is a three and a half to four hour drive one
way from Kingman, Arizona. Facing cancer is tough enough but the
financial worries make it far worse. Deb has an older vehicle; a 1991, Ford
Ranger which is in disrepair. It is in serious need of work and the tires are
bald. Worse yet, the additional gas expenses aren’t in her tight budget yet are
desperately needed to get her back and forth to Phoenix. Our hope is that with the kindness
of others we might be able to help Debbie by having her truck worked on,
replacing the tires and hopefully funding the gas expense for her trips to and
from Phoenix.
If we can make this happen it would be an amazing relief, taking some of the worry
away from her already stressful situation. If in sharing Debbie’s story we
could raise $3000.00 it could make a world of difference to her, her life and
her recovery. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Posture Keeper is for all ages.</strong></p>
<p>Do you find yourself nagging your kids to sit up straight or to stop slouching? What kid even knows what posture is. or remembers it even if you teach them? Heck, it's hard enough for adults to be aware. Posture Keeper helps your kids sit upright, whether they are on the computer doing their homework or playing computer games. </p>

<p>In the morning, you're pumped and raring to go. But, as the day wanes on, you start to slouch and hunch forward to your computer screen, putting tremendous stress on your spine. Before you know it, your neck, shoulders and back are killing you. <b>When you feel tired, your body stops being able to hold itself upright. </b>That’s because your muscles are fatigued. It’s not your fault that you start slouching.    </p>
<p>Other times, you might get so engrossed in your work that you're not even aware you're practically kissing your computer monitor. The more you concentrate, the more likely you will hunch. Everyone does it. But, doing this for long periods of time is detrimental to your body and to your health..</p>

<p><b>Because it's on the chair, you won't forget to use it.</b> AND when you're not using the straps, you can move it to the back of the chair and use the comfortable lumbar support.</p>

I've been seen by over 10 different doctors, ranging from Orthopedic surgeons to Chiropractors and Physical Therapist.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My pain was so bad, that I nearly lost all hope for a normal life. I was cranky, sleep-deprived and constantly tired. Being in pain is horrible and it can suck the life out of you.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One day, at the chiropractor's office, my doctor said, “You need to stop being on the computer.” I said, “No...can't do that.” Then he said, “Stop leaning forward. It's pinching your nerves. There is technically nothing wrong with you except you’re in pain. You’ve done every test there is do… all negative. So, the only logical culprit is your posture. You’re sitting badly.”  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I came home that day, my son was throwing out his backpack and, suddenly, the light bulb turned on. I wondered, “If I had something that held me back, would that solve the leaning forward issue that was the root cause of my back and neck pain?” So, I tore the backpack apart, attached the needed pieces and tried it for 2 weeks straight. Sure enough, over that period of time, the radiating sensation of pain subsided, my chest walls, usually tight, loosened up; I was even able to raise both my hands to the ceiling, which was something that was difficult for me to do. I was blown away! That's when I knew a product like this could help other people improve their posture and reduce their pain.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am sharing, here, some photos of the journey I took to bring Posture Keeper to a Kickstarter launch<div data-id=""22026301""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1535588036/l4yq0vejnf2v5u0bioep.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>I broke my husband’s old sewing machine and had to get another one. I also got a crash course on how to install a bobbin. Prior to that, I never sewed before. Luckily, I was able to sew up a good enough prototype to send to the factory for them to improve upon. There were also numerous trips to the office supply store to make sure that Posture Keeper fits most chairs in the marketplace. Interestingly enough, no one came over to ask me what I was doing. They probably thought I was crazy or something. </p>

<p>This journey has not been an easy road to travel. What keeps me moving forward is knowing, in my heart of hearts, that Posture Keeper can truly help people improve their posture and help those living with pain, due to prolonged sitting, find tremendous relief.</p>
<p>There were so many people who helped me along the way. It all started with the encouragement of my good friend Perry Belcher, co-founder of Digital Marketer, who insisted that I discuss the Posture Keeper idea with Kevin Harrington, one of the original Shark Tank Investors. After seeing my drawings and video, Kevin encouraged me to pursue my concept. Then there is my team: Macy Tan, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/declandunn/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Declan Dunn</a>, Amor Traceski, and Ken Lin who have been there for me and the project, every step of the way. </p>
<p>To all my friends and family who put up with my non-stop chatter and relentless pestering for them to try on and test-drive the different version of Posture Keeper.</p>
<p>To Sal Briggman of <a href=""https://www.crowdcrux.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crowdcrux</a>, whose mentorship gave me a crash course in understanding how Crowdfunding works.</p>
<p>Special thank you to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/donschnure/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Schnure</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/perrybelcher/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perry Belcher</a> for their help with the video script. They both truly are copywriting geniuses.</p>

<p><b>1. Will I look silly with this Posture Keeper on?</b></p>
<p>If your back is killing you, you shouldn’t worry about looking silly.</p>
<p><b>2. Will Posture Keeper fit my chair?</b></p>
<p>Posture Keeper fits most chairs. Ideal back of the chair height is between 18”H to 33”H. For chairs that are less than 18”H, it may be difficult to adjust, as the top of the Posture Keeper will tend to bend backwards which, long-term, will damage the memory foam material that the Lumbar Support is made of. For chairs that are more than 33”H, the Middle Strap may not be long enough to reach the Connectors that it needs to be attached to.</p>
<p><b>3.  Is the Posture Keeper’s Lumbar Support adjustable? </b></p>
<p>The Lumbar Support is adjustable in that you can raise it up and down the chair to your desired position. To make sure that you have the proper form with the Posture Keeper’s lumbar support, you must align it with the natural curvature of your back/spine when you sit. The straps can also be adjusted to fit most body types.</p>
<p><b>4. How do I clean the Posture Keeper? </b></p>
<p>Spot clean, as needed, using a soft damp cloth. Do NOT use anything abrasive, such as a brush, especially on the cover’s surface. The material is breathable and, actually, has little, tiny holes that could get punctured and accidentally enlarged, if not cleaned properly. You can remove the memory foam and take the cover to be dry cleaned.</p>
<p><b>5. How long should I use Posture Keeper during the day?</b></p>
<p>We recommended that Posture Keeper is used in a snug (not tight) position for no more than four (4) hours a day. We strongly advise that you keep hydrated at all times and get up, at least, once every hour to stretch your legs and take a brief walk. You can use Posture Keeper for longer than four (4) hours, as long as you either have the straps fastened very loosely on your body or you put away the straps and use only the lumbar support to lean back on.</p>
<p><b>6. I frequently get up from my chair. Will Posture Keeper still help me? </b></p>
<p>Yes, as long as you plan your work activity. Organize all the tasks that require you to frequently get up from your chair. During this time period, don't use the Posture Keeper. When you know that you will be sitting for a while, e.g. more than 30 minutes, then you should use Posture Keeper to keep you from leaning forward.</p>
<p><b>7. Can I use Posture Keeper in my car? </b></p>
<p>No. We do not recommend using Posture Keeper in any moving vehicle or airplane.  There are laws and regulations that affect passenger safety.  Posture Keeper was designed to be used on an office chair and/or dining room chair. </p>
<p><b>Disclaimer: </b>Posture Keeper is not a medical device and no medical claims are being made. It is designed as a lumbar support device with straps that are provided to hold a person upright and to prevent the forward-leaning behavior. Should you have a medical condition, please consult with your doctor prior to using Posture Keeper.</p>

</div></div>","Suppose you could relieve back and neck tension (while also improving your posture)? What if you didn’t have to do anything - you could just have your chair do it for you? Now you can, we're so excited to introduce Posture Keeper. 
 Image showing C Shaped Spine when hunched over.Do you feel neck, shoulder or back pain at the end of the workday? The cause is simple: you’re leaning forward and/or hunching over your keyboard, unaware of the cumulative injury that your poor posture is causing in your body each day. On average, you're likely to be sitting more than 7 hours a day. Combine constant sitting with prolonged poor posture and it’s no wonder you’re in pain. Pain makes it impossible to concentrate at work and you’re filled with dread knowing tomorrow it’s all going to start again.   A prolonged period in the hunched position results in back pain.
 
 Now you can end that cycle of pain. Posture Keeper will help you sit upright and support your lower back while you work. The unique design eases lower back pain, making you more productive. It will take your mind off your back and let you finally focus on your work.Leaning Forward is the Problem Leaning forward and hunching over the computer is the number one cause of persistent neck and back pain in the workplace, according to our research. Current posture trainer products in the market address some issues, but miss the root cause. They rely on your ability to be aware that you are leaning forward. Most people are unaware that they are hunching over and/or slouching. When you lean forward, it causes Forward Head Posture. Posture Keeper focuses on reducing Forward Head Posture (FHP) which is becoming a major health issue in a work world filled with smartphones, laptops and computer monitors.When you use Posture Keeper, the straps gently rest on your shoulders. the moment you start to lean forward, you will know right away, which then allows you to self-correct and avoid the painful effects of prolonged poor posture.
Most people are not aware that they are slouching or leaning forward.

 
The Posture Keeper is designed to make you feel comfortable. You adjust and secure the lumbar support to the exact position that’s right for you. You only have to do this once. Simply snap the Posture Keeper in place and begin working.


 
Posture Keeper was designed to fit a wide range of chairs. It can be installed on almost any chair with a back height of 18” to 33”. Use it anywhere you have to sit for long periods of time at home or at work

 
Posture Keeper Helps The Root Causes of Neck, Back, and Shoulder Pain

 

 


 

 
About 1 out of 3 working adults experience some form of back pain at work. It is the most common job-related disability and the leading reason why employees miss work days.   


Years of slouching wear away at your spine, making it more fragile and prone to injury, in addition to creating other health concerns.

Nearly 70% of American are taking prescription drugs to help with chronic aches and pains. Taking medication over a long period of time is not good for your body. Posture Keep is a drug-free solution that you can set up in less than 30 seconds. Prevention is the key. If you can prevent the poor sitting posture, then you won't have to take unnecessary medication.

 

 
Rounded shoulders and the rounding of the upper back seriously affects the health of your neck. Leaning your body forward puts considerable pressure on your spine, which affects other parts of your body, like your lower back, neck, shoulders, wrist and other joints.  

 
Most people don't realize that poor sitting posture also affects their standing posture. Left unchecked, poor posture leads to Thoracic Kyphosis, as well as, Forward Head Posture (FHP). Both are detrimental to your health and well-being.


 
Posture Keeper is for all ages.
Do you find yourself nagging your kids to sit up straight or to stop slouching? What kid even knows what posture is. or remembers it even if you teach them? Heck, it's hard enough for adults to be aware. Posture Keeper helps your kids sit upright, whether they are on the computer doing their homework or playing computer games. 

 
There is overwhelming evidence that having proper posture, whether you're sitting or standing, is good for your health. 

Having the proper posture helps you look healthier, taller and, overall, more confident.
 

In the morning, you're pumped and raring to go. But, as the day wanes on, you start to slouch and hunch forward to your computer screen, putting tremendous stress on your spine. Before you know it, your neck, shoulders and back are killing you. When you feel tired, your body stops being able to hold itself upright. That’s because your muscles are fatigued. It’s not your fault that you start slouching.    
Other times, you might get so engrossed in your work that you're not even aware you're practically kissing your computer monitor. The more you concentrate, the more likely you will hunch. Everyone does it. But, doing this for long periods of time is detrimental to your body and to your health..

 
Posture Keeper won't let you lean forward

 

 

Unlike other posture corrector or trainers, Posture Keeper stays on your chair. You only have to set it up once. You can slip on the straps easily. 
Because it's on the chair, you won't forget to use it. AND when you're not using the straps, you can move it to the back of the chair and use the comfortable lumbar support.
 
 
 

 

 


 


 

Tested on over 20+ office chairs + 2 dining room chairs. Here are a few of them.

Dozens of beta testers give their thumbs up to Posture Keeper. 

 
 



 

 

 
I had chronic back pain for over 10 years and sought treatment after treatment. I've been seen by over 10 different doctors, ranging from Orthopedic surgeons to Chiropractors and Physical Therapist.  
 
My pain was so bad, that I nearly lost all hope for a normal life. I was cranky, sleep-deprived and constantly tired. Being in pain is horrible and it can suck the life out of you.  
 
One day, at the chiropractor's office, my doctor said, “You need to stop being on the computer.” I said, “No...can't do that.” Then he said, “Stop leaning forward. It's pinching your nerves. There is technically nothing wrong with you except you’re in pain. You’ve done every test there is do… all negative. So, the only logical culprit is your posture. You’re sitting badly.”  
 
When I came home that day, my son was throwing out his backpack and, suddenly, the light bulb turned on. I wondered, “If I had something that held me back, would that solve the leaning forward issue that was the root cause of my back and neck pain?” So, I tore the backpack apart, attached the needed pieces and tried it for 2 weeks straight. Sure enough, over that period of time, the radiating sensation of pain subsided, my chest walls, usually tight, loosened up; I was even able to raise both my hands to the ceiling, which was something that was difficult for me to do. I was blown away! That's when I knew a product like this could help other people improve their posture and reduce their pain.  
 
I am sharing, here, some photos of the journey I took to bring Posture Keeper to a Kickstarter launch
I broke my husband’s old sewing machine and had to get another one. I also got a crash course on how to install a bobbin. Prior to that, I never sewed before. Luckily, I was able to sew up a good enough prototype to send to the factory for them to improve upon. There were also numerous trips to the office supply store to make sure that Posture Keeper fits most chairs in the marketplace. Interestingly enough, no one came over to ask me what I was doing. They probably thought I was crazy or something.

This journey has not been an easy road to travel. What keeps me moving forward is knowing, in my heart of hearts, that Posture Keeper can truly help people improve their posture and help those living with pain, due to prolonged sitting, find tremendous relief.
There were so many people who helped me along the way. It all started with the encouragement of my good friend Perry Belcher, co-founder of Digital Marketer, who insisted that I discuss the Posture Keeper idea with Kevin Harrington, one of the original Shark Tank Investors. After seeing my drawings and video, Kevin encouraged me to pursue my concept. Then there is my team: Macy Tan, Declan Dunn, Amor Traceski, and Ken Lin who have been there for me and the project, every step of the way. 
To all my friends and family who put up with my non-stop chatter and relentless pestering for them to try on and test-drive the different version of Posture Keeper.
To Sal Briggman of Crowdcrux, whose mentorship gave me a crash course in understanding how Crowdfunding works.
Special thank you to Don Schnure and Perry Belcher for their help with the video script. They both truly are copywriting geniuses.
Special thanks to Dr. Christopher Colgin, who believed in the Posture Keeper mission and for his unwavering support. You can reach out to him here: drcolgin@drchriscolgin.com

1. Will I look silly with this Posture Keeper on?
If your back is killing you, you shouldn’t worry about looking silly.
2. Will Posture Keeper fit my chair?
Posture Keeper fits most chairs. Ideal back of the chair height is between 18”H to 33”H. For chairs that are less than 18”H, it may be difficult to adjust, as the top of the Posture Keeper will tend to bend backwards which, long-term, will damage the memory foam material that the Lumbar Support is made of. For chairs that are more than 33”H, the Middle Strap may not be long enough to reach the Connectors that it needs to be attached to.
3.  Is the Posture Keeper’s Lumbar Support adjustable? 
The Lumbar Support is adjustable in that you can raise it up and down the chair to your desired position. To make sure that you have the proper form with the Posture Keeper’s lumbar support, you must align it with the natural curvature of your back/spine when you sit. The straps can also be adjusted to fit most body types.
4. How do I clean the Posture Keeper? 
Spot clean, as needed, using a soft damp cloth. Do NOT use anything abrasive, such as a brush, especially on the cover’s surface. The material is breathable and, actually, has little, tiny holes that could get punctured and accidentally enlarged, if not cleaned properly. You can remove the memory foam and take the cover to be dry cleaned.
5. How long should I use Posture Keeper during the day?
We recommended that Posture Keeper is used in a snug (not tight) position for no more than four (4) hours a day. We strongly advise that you keep hydrated at all times and get up, at least, once every hour to stretch your legs and take a brief walk. You can use Posture Keeper for longer than four (4) hours, as long as you either have the straps fastened very loosely on your body or you put away the straps and use only the lumbar support to lean back on.
6. I frequently get up from my chair. Will Posture Keeper still help me? 
Yes, as long as you plan your work activity. Organize all the tasks that require you to frequently get up from your chair. During this time period, don't use the Posture Keeper. When you know that you will be sitting for a while, e.g. more than 30 minutes, then you should use Posture Keeper to keep you from leaning forward.
7. Can I use Posture Keeper in my car? 
No. We do not recommend using Posture Keeper in any moving vehicle or airplane.  There are laws and regulations that affect passenger safety.  Posture Keeper was designed to be used on an office chair and/or dining room chair. 
Disclaimer: Posture Keeper is not a medical device and no medical claims are being made. It is designed as a lumbar support device with straps that are provided to hold a person upright and to prevent the forward-leaning behavior. Should you have a medical condition, please consult with your doctor prior to using Posture Keeper.

<p>In the fall of 2013 I was positioning a much needed supportive beam in the kitchen of my home. While leveraging this beam in place, the end opposite slipped off of its post and fell to the floor. Unfortunately, one end of this 14 foot wooden beam was still in my right hand. The reverberative  impact was absorbed by palm and wrist, resulting in serious damage to my median nerve and also causing a misalignment of my thumb joint resulting in bone spur growth. These injuries have drastically diminished my ability to use this hand. Simple actions such as turnng the key to a lock, making a bed or opening a bottle of water, now present as complex actions.  Since the accident I have given myself plenty of rest and in attempts to alleviate pain and discomfort, received cortisone injections in the joint and the nerve. The injections have given minimal relief and it now transpires that the nerve damage has been too severe to be improved by rest alone.</p>
<p>I have been scheduled for a carpel tunnel release surgery in  late August. If effective, the nerves will be free from any stress and will be allowed to heal, returning strength and dexterity to my hand.  After the surgery there will between one and three month period of enforced rest followed by a very gradual return to normal movement and use of the hand. I will have been unable to earn money for eight months by the time I am projected to return to full strength. I am an artist and a self-employed contractor - I work with my hands.

YUN's probiotherapy combats the harmful bacteria that cause skin concerns in a natural way. Love your bacteria. We do.We've all been there...Our skin is our largest organ. It is covered by a layer of friendly bacteria, called the microbiome, that protects your skin against the elements. Just like any other part of the body, your skin can suffer from all sorts of annoying problems caused by bacterial imbalances. Spots and blemishes, acne, athlete’s foot, vaginal infections and more; we’ve all been there.  HOW DOES YUN PROBIOTHERAPY WORK? Traditionally we've tended to treat skin concerns, caused by bacterial imbalances with antibacterial soaps, antifungal sprays, even antibiotics, which strip away both the harmful bacteria as well as our protective ones. Why kill the good along with the bad? There's absolutely no need. In fact, we're much better off being kind to our friendly bacteria as they help keep us safe and healthy. IT'S SIMPLE REALLY!
  We have a range of washes and creams that are safe for our microbiome. These contain a unique formula of emulsifiers and preservatives that are kind to our skin and our microbiome.Next to that we have a range of sprays and creams to treat common skin concerns.

Our cause:
Many of us take access to clean drinking water very much for granted.  Every day we use clean water; we cook with it, clean with it, bathe in it, play in it, we even use it to flush our toilets!  And most importantly we drink it.  

However, 2.5 billion people in this world don't even have the luxury of taking a drink of clean pure water; let alone cooking, cleaning, bathing or playing in it and many have no access to a toilet.What we are going to do about it:
Our project team is on a mission to make a difference.  We are 9 adults and 2 youth strong and have a can do attitude!  In June 2015 we will travel to the Dominican Republic to work with Wine to Water to provide relief for the poor there.  Part of our project will be to construct water filters at a facility and then distribute them to poor families so they will have clean water to drink and cook with.  We are also raising funds to install a well to provide clean water to 300 people.  This well will operate for the next ten years and provide much needed clean water; any extra funds we raise above our funding goal will be used to fund additional wells.How you can help:
 Cost:  Here is the breakdown of costs to support the 11 people planning to travel to the Dominican Republic:
Cost Per Person:  $1000  (covers: lodging, transportation in country, food and 25% goes towards the work we will be doing while there; which is constructing water filters and distributing them)

Airfare:  $500 (Each person traveling will be covering this cost out of pocket.
Money for the well.  We need to raise $1,500 to fund the well.

There are three reasons. 1. To have the best possible sound, the microphone of Good Night Charly should be as close as possible to the baby. Well, put a camera that close to your kid and no matter how cute your baby is the image will be horrible.2. Not every parent wants a camera in their baby room.

We have an experimental drug that may prevent or cure over 30 cureless, devastating
diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, Lou Gehrig’s,
type-2 diabetes, and many others that have a common underlying mechanism.
The drug has shown improvement in 7 different disease models without side effects!

We are a team of scientists led by Gal

never know who might have a relative or a friend who may be affected by one of
these horrible diseases.


We are asking
for your money so that we can work even harder to find a cure that will benefit
all of humanity.

If everyone who has been affected by these diseases, contributes one dollar, we will have what we need to move forward quickly towards clinical trials.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Kat and sometime in 2009 I was bitten by a tick. I would soon find that ticks are very powerful parasites: They have the ability to make you forget your name or phone number, say ""lettuce"" instead of ""gasoline"", cause debilitating pain and fatigue, make your facial muscles twitch uncontrollably, isolate you from your friends and family and leave you depressed, alone and broke. The cost of treatment for this highly controversial disease is in the tens of thousands...if you're lucky enough to be insured. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping raise the money I need to pay for the treatments for Late Stage Chronic/Neurological Lyme Disease, you're helping a 28 year old girl have a shot at a normal life again. You're helping a girl go back to her life of adventure and activism. I want to inspire the world to be active in their life and the world around them whether it be philanthropic, social activism, socially responsible media or creative business ventures like TOM's Shoes. Since I've gotten sick, I haven't been able to volunteer, fund-raise or pursue any other avenue of social responsibility. My wish is that I will soon be able to return to this. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<div>The funds raised will go towards the cost of medical treatment for Late Stage Chronic Lyme Disease. Current treatments cost upwards of $1800 per month. My Dr has warned me of the possible necessity of a Port or PICC Line in order to administer daily IV infusions of Rocephin, which will increase the monthly cost of treatment by $1000. There is also roughly $5000 in lab bills, which I will scan copies of. The money I raise through this will go to medical expenses ONLY, NOT personal living expenses. </div>
</div><div> <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>Instead of offering ""perks"", I've created a Cafe Press shop where you can buy Lyme Awareness products. There are T-shirts, tote bags, water bottles...even iPhone cases! As with this fundraiser, all proceeds go towards my medical treatment. </div>

<div>Please share this with your social network. No contribution is too small! Sharing my page on Facebook, Twitter or even email is simple, thanks to the share tools IndieGoGo has implemented!</div>

<p><strong>The Reason Why</strong></p>
<p>I have been working in the medical field for 10 years. And it never fails. I always hear how clients from Routine Doctor Appointments, Dialysis Centers, Rehabilitation Centers, Hospital Discharges and disabled veterans complain about the transportation services and there experience. My partner and I came up with the brilliant idea to make a difference and create our own NEMT (Non-Emergency Medical Transportation) company. We want Blue Angel Medical Transport to provide the best care to our clients by treating each individual person like one of our own family members. We want to strive to over exceed expectations with quality service as our primary goal. We want to provide nothing less than an exceptional transportation service. Our main goal would be to get you or your loved ones where they need to be in a safe timely matter, when they need to get there. It is difficult for a family member to take on the challenges of transporting a loved one that may be temporarily or permanently disabled. We need your help and support. Give us a chance and help us turn this dream into reality.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>An avid lacrosse player, teacher in America, and adventurer.  My name is Patrick Verdun and I am 24 years old.  I am the youngest of seven children and just received my masters degree in teaching in hopes of becoming a teacher and lacrosse coach.</p>
<p>Unlike most lacrosse enthusiasts I came to learn the medicine game after coming to college at Southern Oregon University.  It was here while pursuing my education I truly found my passion in life.  Lacrosse is unlike all other games and their is a reason Native Americans, founders of the game, call it the medicine game.  Unlike other hobbies of my mine, lacrosse is always a spiritual experience for me whether I am playing by myself or in the biggest game of the season.  Lacrosse is with me now till I die.  This game has provided me more life opportunities, friends, family, and life experiences then almost any other facet of my life.  This game heals my soul, mends my heart, brings peace to my mind, and brings me closer to God.  That is why I want to so badly go on this trip with USAAI.</p>
<p>USAAi, which is described below, has offered me the opportunity to travel to Melbourne, Australia from June 4th 2013, to June 15th, 2013 and take part in the Down Under Cup Invitational Lacrosse Tournament as part of a lacrosse team representing the USA.  You must be recommended by someone to USAAI before you are even considered for a trip.  The team consists of lacrosse players from all over the United States.  However, as it stands I am the only attendee from a west coast college, the state of Oregon, and a school without a varsity lacrosse program.  I might as well have played on an NCAA level lacrosse team with the amount of work, dedication, and time I have put in and still do even after finishing college.  Currently, I help out with the college team at Southern Oregon University while teaching and also working at an alternative school.  Wherever I go, I bring my excitement for lacrosse with me as all of my students will tell you.  This enriching experience will definitely add to that and help me to grow the game even more.</p>
<p>USAAI, or USA Athletes International, Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to giving amateur athletes and coaches the opportunity to participate in international Olympic-style sporting events throughout the world, while also allowing them to broaden their educational and cultural knowledge of the world through the experience.  With over 20 years experience of international sports tournament travel.  We currently are represented with over 900 athletes in 7 sports that travel around the world to over 14 countries.</p>
<p>It is an honor to be able to participate on one of these adventures and represent the USA at the international lacrosse level.  A dream of mine is to play this game where ever I can and till the day I die.  This trip will be keeping that dream alive.</p>

<p>The base fee for this trip is $5,000.  This doesn't include a fuel surcharge to Australia or my connecting flights to and from our designated meeting location.  These funds pay for travel to Australia, room and board, team uniforms, and team expeditions.  All funds will be used for the sole purpose of this USAAI trip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is hard for me to put the impact this trip will have in words.  I will be having the opportunity to play lacrosse, which is always exciting for me.  I will be part of an international team competing at a very high level and representing the USA.  What an opportunity!  Not to mention all the wonderful people I will meet on the team and on my travels.  This trip also provides me with the opportunity to see another part of the world.  I will be exposed to new people, new culture, and new ways of life. An experience that will only help me to develop more global knowledge and allow me to share it with my students and players back home.</p>

It is hard for me to put the impact this trip will have in words.  I will be having the opportunity to play lacrosse, which is always exciting for me.  I will be part of an international team competing at a very high level and representing the USA.  What an opportunity!  Not to mention all the wonderful people I will meet on the team and on my travels.  This trip also provides me with the opportunity to see another part of the world.  I will be exposed to new people, new culture, and new ways of life. An experience that will only help me to develop more global knowledge and allow me to share it with my students and players back home.

<p>Their home is The Africa Rising Cycling
Centre. It also serves as a training facility for all countries on the

common diseases such as diarrhoea, arsenicosis, cholera, fluorosis,
intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, trachoma and typhoid.</p>
<p>What we in Australia expect as a basic

<p>They are trying to raise US$25,000 to
purchase a water filtration system so that the riders, their staff and guests
can drink fresh water, when they want.</p>
<p>I researched more information on Rwanda,
the team and sporting heroes of Rwanda.</p>
<p>For several days I couldn’t get the
images of horror from the genocide out of my mind. The team has a participant
in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, Adrien Niyonshuti, whose six brothers were
brutally slaughtered during Rwanda’s 100 day Genocide. Perhaps he is the first
cycling hero from Rwanda. Except for several soccer players, there appears to
be few Rwandan sporting heroes to act as role models for their youth.</p>
<p>I decided I would donate via
indiegogo.com for the Water Filtration Fundraiser, but further, I decided to
use our business skills and networks to try and raise the full US$25,000 they
require.</p>

water, and every child deserves to have a hero to aspire to. If we can play a

The money raised will cover medical bills and help with the costs of caring for his baby boy, who is due to be born on July 22nd.</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The story...</strong></h3>
<p>On June 9th, 2012, Angel was rushed to Sarasota Memorial Hospital by ambulance after collapsing at his and his fiancé’s baby shower. Before he reached the hospital his heart stopped and he had to be revived. Upon arriving at the emergency room, his heart stopped and was revived another 2 times. The heart surgeon on staff, and the one who saved Angel’s life, immediately took Angel into surgery. On the way into the operating room and then again on the operating table, Angel’s heart stopped and was revived again, for a total of 5 times.</p>
<p>During surgery, it was found that a 2-foot long blood clot had traveled into Angel’s main artery to his left lung, which stopped the airflow (i.e. pulmonary embolism). He was kept in ICU for 4 days and was given a total of 45 blood transfusions within 72 hours. There were additional, smaller blood clots that were found, so he has been given the blood thinner Coumadin intravenously since being in the hospital. The doctor also inserted a permanent type of screen in his main artery, which will catch any new blood clots that form.</p>
<p>While in recovery, he has also suffered from pancreatitis and reoccurring fluid around the outside of his lungs. On July 5<sup>th</sup> he had to have a thoracotomy to remove infection and scar tissue build up on his lung.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Angel was strong and survived this ordeal. He has been in the hospital since then, slowly recovering. He has suffered from depression and anxiety that has required medication to help treat, and he speaks daily with a therapist 1-on-1 to help him cope. Brain damage has not been detected to date.</p>
<p>Many of the medical staff at Sarasota Memorial Hospital are calling Angel, ‘the miracle guy.’</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Before he collapsed…</strong></h3>
<p>In early May, Angel noticed he had pain in his left lower leg. He went to the Sarasota County Health Department and had an x-ray taken and was given Tramadol, an opiate pain reliever.</p>
<p>Shortly after, with no reprieve from Tramadol, the pain then moved to his chest. Angel went to the emergency room at Doctors Hospital of Sarasota. He told the doctor that he had pain in his leg that had gone away and now was in his rib area. They took a chest x-ray and told him it was a muscle strain. They sent him home with a prescription for ibuprofen.</p>
<p>Not long after, Angel developed a dry cough, chest pain, and extreme shortness of breath. He went back to the Sarasota County Health Department where they did a heart EKG and gave him a prescription for Amoxicillin, a penicillin-based antibiotic to treat bacterial infections. He is allergic to penicillin (it was stated in his medical records), so he went back to the health department the next day and they gave him a new prescription for Erythromycin, which is used to treat bacterial infections, but without penicillin.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why it happened…</strong></h3>
<p>The doctors still do not have an answer as to why he developed the blood clots. He is not an at risk person to develop them, which is most likely why he was not diagnosed previous to his pulmonary embolism. A few of the factors have been ruled out, but they still may never understand why it happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The future…</strong></h3>
<p>Angel just finished high school and turned 19 years old in March. His fiancé is pregnant with their son, who is due to arrive on July 22<sup>nd</sup>. He only just started working as a Certified Nurse Assistant and was making plans for his new family’s life together. His fiancé, Sammie, only 18 years old, had plans to stay home and take care of their son for at least the first 6 months after Zayden is born.</p>
<p>Since this traumatizing ordeal, not only does Angel experience severe physical pain, he now suffers from severe anxiety and depression as well. At 19 years old, he had something terrible and unexplainable happen to him. Perhaps you remember what it was like for you at that age, just getting your life started? Being young with so many hopes and dreams? Now it’s not only his future he has to think about, but his son’s future as well. How is he going to be able to support himself and his new family?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How you can help…</strong></h3>
<p>Luckily, Angel and Sammie have a great support network of parents, grandparents, sisters, aunts, uncles, and friends, but a little money to help them along until they can figure out what the future holds would be an incredible blessing at this time. Angel has health insurance, but it will not cover all of his medical bills and he will not be able to work for quite some time.</p>
<p>I am hoping to raise as much money as I can to cover some of the costs for their son Zayden's first year and to cover some of the costs of Angel’s medical bills.</p>
<p>Please contribute whatever you can. Any amount will be extremely appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>A </strong><strong>personal note…</strong>
</h3>
<p>There is nothing that can ever prepare you too see someone you love so much, be so vulnerable and in such a critical state. The massive swelling of his body, the amount of tubes coming out of him, and the machines helping to keep him alive is something that I will never be able to forget, and never want to see him go through again. I’d like to personally thank Sarasota Memorial Hospital for saving Angel’s life and for helping him recover.</p>

In early May, Angel noticed he had pain in his left lower leg. He went to the Sarasota County Health Department and had an x-ray taken and was given Tramadol, an opiate pain reliever.
Shortly after, with no reprieve from Tramadol, the pain then moved to his chest. Angel went to the emergency room at Doctors Hospital of Sarasota. He told the doctor that he had pain in his leg that had gone away and now was in his rib area. They took a chest x-ray and told him it was a muscle strain. They sent him home with a prescription for ibuprofen.
Not long after, Angel developed a dry cough, chest pain, and extreme shortness of breath. He went back to the Sarasota County Health Department where they did a heart EKG and gave him a prescription for Amoxicillin, a penicillin-based antibiotic to treat bacterial infections. He is allergic to penicillin (it was stated in his medical records), so he went back to the health department the next day and they gave him a new prescription for Erythromycin, which is used to treat bacterial infections, but without penicillin.
 
Why it happened…
The doctors still do not have an answer as to why he developed the blood clots. He is not an at risk person to develop them, which is most likely why he was not diagnosed previous to his pulmonary embolism. A few of the factors have been ruled out, but they still may never understand why it happened.
 
The future…
Angel just finished high school and turned 19 years old in March. His fiancé is pregnant with their son, who is due to arrive on July 22nd. He only just started working as a Certified Nurse Assistant and was making plans for his new family’s life together. His fiancé, Sammie, only 18 years old, had plans to stay home and take care of their son for at least the first 6 months after Zayden is born.
Since this traumatizing ordeal, not only does Angel experience severe physical pain, he now suffers from severe anxiety and depression as well. At 19 years old, he had something terrible and unexplainable happen to him. Perhaps you remember what it was like for you at that age, just getting your life started? Being young with so many hopes and dreams? Now it’s not only his future he has to think about, but his son’s future as well. How is he going to be able to support himself and his new family?
 
How you can help…
Luckily, Angel and Sammie have a great support network of parents, grandparents, sisters, aunts, uncles, and friends, but a little money to help them along until they can figure out what the future holds would be an incredible blessing at this time. Angel has health insurance, but it will not cover all of his medical bills and he will not be able to work for quite some time.
I am hoping to raise as much money as I can to cover some of the costs for their son Zayden's first year and to cover some of the costs of Angel’s medical bills.
Please contribute whatever you can. Any amount will be extremely appreciated.
 

A personal note…

There is nothing that can ever prepare you too see someone you love so much, be so vulnerable and in such a critical state. The massive swelling of his body, the amount of tubes coming out of him, and the machines helping to keep him alive is something that I will never be able to forget, and never want to see him go through again. I’d like to personally thank Sarasota Memorial Hospital for saving Angel’s life and for helping him recover.

If at least one in four alcoholic drinks you consume throughout your day contains Prime, you will wake up with a significantly reduced to no hangover, and you'll be ready to start the next day. We have developed a one of a kind formula, but now we need help with finalization of flavoring and manufacturing.

The symptoms of a hangover can range from feeling sluggish, loss of appetite, and feeling drowsy. The reason you get hung over is because when you drink your body produces acetaldehyde in your blood stream which depletes Vitamin B1 and can damage your liver. Your liver naturally produces chemicals to keep the level of acetaldehyde toxicity in check, but it reaches a point when it can no longer produce enough fight it.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/593677/files/20140520221542-Bigger_infographic.jpg?1400649342"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>How Prime Helps</h3><p>Prime has the amino acids and biochemicals your liver needs to naturally break down acetaldehyde and prevent it from harming your body.

GET YOUR GAME DATA AUTOMATICALLY

Are you tired of fiddling with your golf GPS or electronic scorecard to keep your game up to par? What if, instead of manually entering details of your round, you could focus on playing BUT still get all the statistics from each and every shot? What if you could access this data on the course during every round?
Imagine, if the data could be sent from the course to the cloud, back and forth in real time. You could compete with you friends and see live leaderboard even if you played in different tournaments, categories or even countries! Ideas like this helped us come up with an all-in-one golf solution which we call CaddieON.
CADDIEON DESIGN PRINCIPLES


Create a robust solution to automate data collection from a round of golf.
Free the player to focus on the game.
Make golf more interesting, fun and social.


PUT YOUR CADDIE TO WORK

Our groundbreaking automated data collection lets players focus on their game and at the same time gives the player a unique opportunity to get detailed data of his rounds of golf.
HOW IT WORKS


Place a light weight and unnoticeable tag to the top
of the grip in each of your clubs. CaddieON wrist device reads the tag and knows the club you use.
Once you take your swing the wrist device recognizes each shot you take. Practice swings in
the air are not captured.
Your smartphone records the GPS position of each stroke, so you do not need to do any disturbing data
collection activities while taking a shot.
The game data is sent from your smartphone to a player portal on the internet.


During the game you can easily switch between the scorecard, stroke details, rangefinder and course map views in the CaddieON mobile application.

Automated and accurate real time data collection opens a whole new world to the game of golf. Players can use this data to improve. They can relive their golf highlights; they can share each experience from the course or compare their performance with friends and other players. It's not just the wrist device or the app - It's your personal caddie without yearly payments.

<p>My dad, Ron Garropy had a severe stroke on Sunday, Dec 16, 2012. My mom found him on the floor in front of the door at 8:30am, we have no idea how long he had been there.  He was awake but could barely speak and could not move his left side. She was terrified and called 911.  They rushed him to Update Medical where they quickly operated and removed 2 of the 3 clots in his brain.  He still has a small hemorrhage and swelling of the brain...so they transferred him to Neuro ICU for constant monitoring...</p>
<p>He is only 59 and was otherwise so healthy.  We are all still in shock and heartbroken to see my dad laying in a bed, with slurred speech, and no movement on his entire left side of his body.  He does know who we are and that he is in the hospital but is not aware of what happened and cant understand why he cant get out of the bed.  He is still sleeping most of every day.</p>
<p>His road to recovery will be very long and arduous, but he is one of the stongest and most determined people I know...so I am confident he will surprise us all once he wakes up and can really begin rehab. They say it will take years to recover as much as he physically and mentally can- but they dont know my dad! He was so full of life and has so much life left to live...</p>
<p>My parents did NOT have any health insurance, so scary.  My mom is left to care for my dad, work, and take care of the bills on her own. If you can, please help ease some of her financial burdens and worries so she can spend more time focusing on my dad and getting him healthy and rehabilitated.  Please share his story and this campaign with everyone you can. And most importantly, please remember my dad and my family in your prayers.  </p>
<p>My dad will probably be in the hospital in Syracuse for several weeks, if you would like to bring my mom a meal, magazines, snacks, etc while she is there, please call or text me and I will help you get them to her. 256-335-7664</p>

<b>Who We Are</b><br/><br/><b><i>Blanca's House</i></b> is a non-profit organization of 
volunteer healthcare professionals who donate their time to provide 
free, invaluable medical treatment to children and their families. 
Whether through surgery, medical supplies, or educational outreach, 
Blanca's House provides twenty-first century medicine to the 
underprivileged. In addition, we have many projects underway. Since last
 year, we have been sponsoring children here on Long Island whose deformities were so 
severe that the necessary procedures would have been too extensive to be performed overseas. 
Across Long Island and around the world, Blanca's House brings healthcare
 to those who need it most. Inspired by childhood memories of his mother
 caring for friends and family, nurse anesthetist Galo Burbano, 
determined to use his training to bring medical care to underprivileged

<br/>Objective<br/><br/>We
 are in the process of building a four operating room suite in Guayaquil, 
Ecuador. This past July we have accomplished the first phase, 
refurbishing the interior and exterior of the clinic.  Having now 
seen what this clinic will provide for the community and the endless 
possibilities it will present for other visiting non-profits, as well as
 reducing the travel time for Blanca’s House future missions, has 
motivated us and hopefully our supporters will continue to contribute 
until our dream becomes a reality. We are coordinating our first mission
 to our newly refurbished clinic in February 2014.  In conjunction with 
acupuncture therapists from Global Clinic we would like to expand our 
modalities of treatment. The pursuit of Global Clinic is to provide and 
maintain a sustainable network of integrative, holistic medical 
practices to populations with limited or no access to conventional 
healthcare. They fulfill this directive by hosting volunteer outreaches 
in which quality care is administered to communities in need.  
International service efforts focus primarily on locations in developing
 countries, targeting Guatemala, Nepal, and India in particular. Global 
Clinic strives to provide treatments to those who lack access to 
healthcare and suffer from health issues that have remained unresolved 
or untreated by conventional platforms of medicine free of charge to 
each patient. Together, we will develop education outreach and training 
programs with local healthcare infrastructure and care providers, 
including nurses, herbalists, and traditional healers. It is important 
to establish a sustainable healthcare presence through local community 
organizations, leaders, hospitals, clinics, and health centers. We will 
counsel patients so they may adopt healthier ways of living and help 
them implement practical techniques of sustaining whole health. Creating
 an educational platform and environment for healthcare practitioners in
 addition to advancing their professional development via the open 
interchange of knowledge, skills, and practices created by the joint 
efforts of all local and international volunteers.<br/><br/><b><i>Global Clinic</i></b> 
is operated by practitioners and supporters of holistic and integrative 
medicine. Modalities of treatment incorporated into our clinical 
approach include, but are not limited to:<br/>• Acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine<br/>• Herbal Therapy<br/>• Massage &amp; Bodywork<br/>• Yoga<br/>• Tai Chi<br/>• Reiki<br/>• Chi gong<br/>• Physical Therapy<br/>• Nutritional Counseling<br/>Our
 practitioners engage a tailored and composite approach to patient care 
by incorporating acupuncture alongside concurrent specialties.  In doing
 so, we believe our patients receive a greater chance at prolonged and 
effective healing, and increased success in achieving their individual 
health goals.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/165156/files/20131030181212-About-Us_.jpg?1383181932"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b><br/>What is Acupuncture? Does it work?</b><br/><br/>Yes!  But not in the way Western medicine might explain.<br/>Acupuncture’s
 history dates back several thousand years to ancient China.  It is 
based on the idea of Qi, also known as the vital force, or energy, of 
life.  Acupuncturists use very fine needles to stimulate the body’s Qi 
and restore proper balance and flow through channels we call meridians.<br/><br/>This
 ancient practice has long been proven to treat and cure many pain 
afflictions and disorders, including arthritis, diabetes, anxiety, and 
hypertension.  Its efficacy can be explained neither by the rational 
mind alone nor proven through the exclusive means of modern science.  By
 shoring up the body’s resources and innate abilities to combat 
imbalances, acupuncture is considered a natural and holistic form of 
healthcare.<br/><br/>The use of acupuncture has been gaining greater momentum 
within the modern medicine community.  The growing number of medical 
doctors who possess and are pursuing acupuncture licenses in order to 
supplement their abilities as care providers are testament to its proven
 benefits and value.<br/> <br/><b>Education &amp; Sustainability</b><br/><br/>We believe 
that education and empowerment go hand in hand and also in having open 
and collaborative communication amongst our practitioners.  Because our 
healthcare approach combines acupuncture with other specialties, our 
healers increase their own knowledge and application.  As a result, they
 may treat their patients at home more effectively and improve their own
 health.<br/><br/>The bigger picture here is creating an empowered and 
educated community that extends beyond the lines of language and 
latitude.  Through practical tips to sustain whole living and direct 
counsel and care to those in need, we contribute to a stronger, 
healthier individual, and therefore, stronger and more resilient local 
communities.  Working together on parochial and international levels we 
create a supportive network that is reinforced by the growth of all 
participants, which includes our partners, patients, and practitioners.<br/><br/>Sustainability
 is fundamental to our success. Everyday actions include reusing 
whenever possible, recycling all disposable and/or recyclable materials,
 conserving natural resources like water and gas, composting leftovers 
from staff and group meals, eliminating unnecessary waste from clinics, 
and creating a culture of preservation and appreciation that can 
continue to thrive after we leave.<br/><br/>To further the concept, we return 
to where we have served, creating an interweb of familiarity, 
connectivity, and most of all, reliability. By building lasting 
relationships with leaders and care providers within the local area, we 
create a larger community of healers in which education and empowerment 
can prosper, which is essential to our mission.<br/><b><br/>How you will help!</b><br/><br/>Donations

volunteer healthcare professionals who donate their time to provide 
free, invaluable medical treatment to children and their families. 
Whether through surgery, medical supplies, or educational outreach, 
Blanca's House provides twenty-first century medicine to the 
underprivileged. In addition, we have many projects underway. Since last
 year, we have been sponsoring children here on Long Island whose deformities were so 
severe that the necessary procedures would have been too extensive to be performed overseas. 
Across Long Island and around the world, Blanca's House brings healthcare
 to those who need it most. Inspired by childhood memories of his mother
 caring for friends and family, nurse anesthetist Galo Burbano, 
determined to use his training to bring medical care to underprivileged 
children in his native Ecuador. To best serve the poor and sick of that 
nation, Burbano founded Blanca’s House, named for his mother.

Now we are growing that good green, and its worth its weight in gold, but we need the public to provide the paper so we can pack up plenty of provisions. 
We do forsee a future where more food is free, where what grows itself is seen as a gift from God and the good earth with no monetary value required to receive.
Until then, the Almighty Dollar regrettably remains the Green Giant, and to get this thing going, 
well.. we may need a few G's.
All proceeds will provide plants to people, publicity of the movement, and preparations for the next phase of the mission.
 So, whats it take to light the fuse on this world changing a-bomb?
 14,400 dollars in 40 days
 Holy guacamole thats a lot of green...
...well not really, if enough of us band together.
Spread the message. Share the word. You are already a part of the movement, and we thank you soldier.
As our special thank you, you will receive A-Bomb brand attire from the Surplus Store.

This bomb is gonna be a block buster, and its all about branding baby. The more we rep, the more we reap. 
                                       There really is enough for everyone.
These Concepts may be a little hard to wrap your head around right now, but with your help in executing our mission and spreading our message, Abundance Agriculture will lead to a
   Food-For-All
                      ...Free-For-All.
                                            ...avogeddon is upon us...
We’ve got a lot of ground to cover.... Literally.
But today we start.
Together we win.
Big trees come from small seeds.
And We have made plants to take over the world.
This is start of a symphony in three movements. 
Spread Abundance, Share Surplus, Cease Scarcity... 
      This is only the beginning...
 The Future is in our Hands...
coming soon... SHARE SURPLUS>>>",16.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Skinny Kosher Creations LLC is based out of Woodstock, New York. Our ownership team has over 13 years of senior management experience within the weight loss industry. When you throw in that we are entrepreneurial, energetic and focused, you have an awesome foundation! Add this to our lineup of amazing products (with more coming!) in an industry that is absolutely booming, and you have, what we believe, is a recipe for great success!</p>
<p><strong>How it Began:</strong></p>
<p>Several years ago, our company president, Brenda Laredo and her family were driving to Disney World. Along the way, Brenda was struck by the fact that there were virtually no food options that were kosher and gluten-free. Rather than complain about it, Brenda conceptualized an array of products. Shelf stable prepared meals, desserts, wine and of course, energy bars. By the following spring, we had developed the first version of our products and we were selling out at every farmer’s market that we attended! Along the way, we listened intently to feedback from our customers. By doing so, we realized that the vegan and lactose intolerant markets were also under-served.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last November and the Skinny Kosher Creations team had a booth at Kosher-Fest, the world’s largest kosher certified products trade show. At Kosher-Fest, we were able to show off our kosher, gluten-free, nut free, vegan and lactose intolerant products. We were ecstatic to find that we were a huge hit and voted as one of the best new products at the show! To top it off, we were written up in multiple publications, including the Huffington Post!</p>
<p>As mentioned, we are cooking up many ideas that will bring about many new flavors. For our launch into the big leagues, we are excited to launch three delicious energy bars! · Choco Chip Coco ‘Tini · Choco Chip Mint ‘Tini · Choco Chip Orange ‘Tini </p>
<p>We are striving to become the “game-changers” in the weight loss / energy bars industry! Our bars are nut, dairy and gluten free. We’re certified kosher, our packaging is awesome, and the taste is shockingly good! All this wrapped in a mere 130 calories!</p>
<p>  If we are going to be game-changers however, we’re going to need your help. We’ve already invested tens of thousands of dollars into our dream, and we need a collective push to get us over the edge! Costs for R&amp;D, packaging and more have really upped the costs. Most importantly, a larger than expected initial interest from several distributors that will put our products in hundreds of stores have us scrambling to keep up! </p>

While many energy bars are simply chocolate bars remarketed as a healthy one, our goal is to provide you with the healthiest ,weight concious bar on the market.

<p>All 3 partners, Brenda, Chloe &amp; Mike come from a corporate background. Fate brought them into the weight loss industry and over a decade later they have never looked back.</p>
<p>Having worked with children and adults and being part of a process that helped them change their lives was nothing short of magical. It was then that they realized that this was an industry that would forever bond them.</p>
<p>After years of working with the public in this field while raising their own families, they realized that there were certain areas that were lacking when on the hunt for food for their own children as well as themselves. <br/>""Being a vegetarian, kosher and healthy made it difficult for me to find delicious, nutritious options for myself"" said co-owner Brenda Laredo. ""Fast forward a few years where I soon discovered that I had developed a gluten intolerance which made finding food on the go quite challenging. Sure, I could cook things from scratch, but when you are working full time and raising a family, there were times...many times where I just needed convenient and healthy options.</p>
<p>When on the go, I looked for healthy energy bars to curb my hunger. If anyone has ever been to the energy bar section at their local grocer or health food store, you know how easy it is to become overwhelmed. There are high protein bars, with really high carbs, or bars with consistency of rice crispies and little flavor.

With little competition in this booming industry, we feel that we have created a line that will change the way people look at healthy weight loss food and to easily have access to convenient products on the go.

When we went inside, we were not able to  distinguish the medical staff from the patients and families.

I could not just stand by after that experience and do nothing to help these people.</span></p>

<p>I have always been a writer… a poet… a spoken word artist… a novelist. However, it is my belief that a true artist has the ability to exercise their artistry in several genres because its an exercise of the same part of the brain. .</p>
<p>Growing up in the bayous of Louisana, I was a tomboy - enjoying the outdoors, climbing trees, experiencing nature. I have always been drawn to wood. The smell…the feel… In looking for an outlet for my hands, I rediscovered wood. I bought a wood-burning tool just to try my hand. I fell in love. I started out burning cigar boxes – turning them into trinket boxes, jewelry boxes and purses. I was gifting them to family and friends when I discovered that I was creating something on which people actually WANTED to spend their money. Those same friends and family wanted to gift them to their friends and family. And Diligent Hands grew beyond any measure than i could imagine for a hobby....</p>
<p>I even had the blessed fortune of teaching my craft to teen girls in 2006 through the City of Atlanta’s ArtsCool summer program. Gradually, I started to evolve the types of product that I produced eventually concentrating almost exclusively on purses and accessories by 2009.</p>
<p>The response was unbelievable. And before I knew it I was being invited to vend at events around Atlanta.  The demand for my purses and accessories lead to the opening of my online store. Before I knew it, I was shipping earrings all of the country and as far as London and Dubai! I was even showcased on SoulTrain.com as one of the TOP 5 URBAN INDIE JEWELRY DESIGNERS in June 2012.</p>
<p>My line's growth can be attributed almost soley to word-of-mouth and social networking. I would like to expand my market to reach a demographic that has shown an genuine interest inn my line.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Suzi Rayve.  Our Dad, Wes (Bud) Henley, was diagnosed with Parkinsons and it is severe.  He is a retired junior high school teacher who gave his all to the kids in Montana for over 30 years and loved it.  He and Mom are living in an assisted living home in Santa Maria, CA.  Unfortunately, dementia is also lurking and in order to keep the shadows away we would like to get them an Apple Imac.  Why an Apple?  Long ago, Dad had the first Apple computer ever available and knows nothing else.  He had a MacEzine and a Mac user group when I was young.  You can still read about it if you google ""Bud at Big Sky Mac"". <br/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> He and Mom would be able to Skype his kids and grandkids and great grandkids on the Imac.  They would be able to watch nature cameras all over the world and escape their pain and fear by visiting people and places they can no longer go physically.  In short, the stimulation would keep both their brains sharp and hopefully inspire them in many ways.  I fear that if they don't get this, their mental health and stability will fail rapidly.  Dad was a highly intelligent and complex individual and to have that intelligence stolen from him by Parkinsons dementia would be devasating. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $2,000.  The Imac 21 inch goes for anywhere from $1,200. to $1,500.   The remainder would be to get it all set up, pay for Wifi so they can get on line, etc. If we don't reach our goal of $2,000., what we do get will be put into a savings account so we can add to it bit by bit until we can afford to get them the Imac.  </p>
<p>I have to say, the perks we are offering are fun and entertaining.  Dad taught science and was always about science!   So, the fact that his daughters are into psychic readings and tarot cards and will be using these as perks to get him the Apple that will hopefully keep him sane is wildly ironic!  We pray he will be able to understand and laugh at the irony when we tell him.  There is so little laughter in his life right now.  As perks I am offering my unique psychic gifts (handed down to us by Mom, more irony) for remote psychic readings and my sister Lori reads the Tarot.  Whether you believe in them or not isn't the idea, the idea is to have fun and enjoy! </p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this and spread the word.  An Apple for the teacher who really needs it!</p>

<p>In a nutshell, my husband Charles served in the U.S. Navy during Desert Shield/Desert Storm and also assisted in Hurricane Andrew Cleanup. Due to his experiences, he has been diagnosed with severe PTSD, which causes high levels of stress and anxiety, a feeling of being in danger or on high alert, nightmares and other psychologically crippling symptoms which restrict him from performing certain daily tasks and attending social functions with family and friends. It has been proven that specially trained service dogs can help people with PTSD break the cycle and snap out of symptoms, which allows them to live a more normal life.</p>
<p>Long version:</p>
<p>Before my husband signed up to join the Navy in 1989, he lived a normal active life. He lettered in track and basketball, was starting goalie for his high school soccer team and played football for several years. He ran or biked five miles a day and was always on the lookout for something to do outside.</p>
<p>While he was in the Navy from 1989 to 1992, Desert Storm and Desert Shield happened, along with a few pretty nasty hurricanes that hit the East Coast and Florida. While he was doing a training excercise, he stretched and twisted his right knee to the point where it would have been better if he had broken all the bones instead. During his recovery, he helped out where he could including being at the air station to help unload bodies coming home from the Gulf War, and assisting in Hurricane Andrew cleanup (body retrieval). At the time it happened, he didn’t feel the effects because it was all part of what they did as sailors – protect and assist the nation in any way possible. As he was in recovery, an order was signed to release people in medical hold and he was given an honorable medical discharge for his service.</p>
<p>Since being out, he has tried to fit back into society as best he can, but bouts of anger, mood swings, nightmares and even flashbacks of seeing bodies have haunted him. It was not until the last few years that it was recognized as possible PTSD, and very recently when it was confirmed and he was given the diagnosis.</p>
<p>While he’s been going through therapy, I found out about groups starting to use dogs trained to assist soldiers and sailors dealing with PTSD. The dogs are aware of when anxiety levels rise, heartbeats start to race, and when blackouts and nightmares happen, and they nudge the person back to reality. By forcing the person to focus on the dog, not how they are feeling, it helps the person calm back down at home, while driving, at the store, at work... wherever. The dogs can also perform other tasks such as watching the person’s back, making sure the personal space boundaries are adequate and providing comfort to ease anxiety. And thanks to the recent changes in the Americans with Disabilities Act, federal law now allows people with PTSD to take their dog with them practically everywhere (except surgery and obvious locations like that).</p>
<p>What he needs:</p>
<p>Charles has done research and found the breed of PTSD service dog he thinks would work best for him (taking his size into consideration) – the Shiloh Shepherd.</p>
<p>Shiloh Shepherds are extremely intelligent, good-natured and powerful enough to nudge Charles and get his attention. He actually knows a breeder locally through a paint club he attends as weekly stress relief therapy, and they have matched up service dogs to people in need before. They are planning out their next litter of pups and will only charge breeding costs.</p>
<p><strong>He needs help coming up with the cost of the PTSD service dog and training.</strong></p>
<ul>

In a nutshell, my husband Charles served in the U.S. Navy during Desert Shield/Desert Storm and also assisted in Hurricane Andrew Cleanup. Due to his experiences, he has been diagnosed with severe PTSD, which causes high levels of stress and anxiety, a feeling of being in danger or on high alert, nightmares and other psychologically crippling symptoms which restrict him from performing certain daily tasks and attending social functions with family and friends. It has been proven that specially trained service dogs can help people with PTSD break the cycle and snap out of symptoms, which allows them to live a more normal life.

Pamela's Famous Fried Green Tomatoes 
Let's start by meeting Pamela:

Pamela was born in Atlanta, GA 

She started cooking at the tender age of 8, and would cook whatever she could get her hands on.
She had an amazing group of Natural Born Cooks to model after... her Grandmother, Mom, and Aunts.

Down south, family is everything, so cooking is just another way time was spent, learning, laughing and loving.



Back home in Atlanta Georgia, Pamela's Grandmother, Mom, and Aunt, are cooking dinner together...

Pamela attended school in New Orleans, LA.

She studied the culture and cuisine, which increased her love of comfort food.



Pamela's Famous Seafood Gumbo



From New Orleans, Pamela moved on to New York City, where she was the General Manager of an NYC staple, Sarabeth's Restaurant. 
From there, she traveled on to Australia and cooked for a high profile family, while working in the Events Department of the Australia Zoo.
Given all her travels and experience , Pamela made time to study her craft, taking classes, working with chefs of 
all types, and really perfecting her preferred style of cuisine. Southern and Cajun! 


Pamela's Kitchen Table, inspired my many child hood memories, is made up of 5 main ingredients . 

Love
Authenticity 

Fresh Homemade Spices 
Passed down Family Recipes
All the comforts of home, with a lot of southern hospitality


But how did she get to this point? Listen to Pamela, in her own words...


  We've got a great plan, a solid foundation, the perfect space, and a menu that beats all others! 
 While Pamela has been able to accomplish a lot on her own, there is still much to be done. 


We want you to come home... 
and that's exactly what the inside of our space will reflect, once we've 
completed the transformation. 
Here's what we need: 

2 additional commercial refrigerators 

1 additional commercial freezer
1 additional stove and sink

A plumbing upgrade ( the space has not been used as a restaurant in quite some time, and needs reconfiguring in order to meet health inspection requirements)

Motivation.  Access our move library anytime, anywhere from your desktop or mobile device at FitnessHardware.com.  Filter by skill level or muscle group focus.   
Time.  ABLE is simple and portable - with nothing to set up or adjust.  Perfect for workouts at home or taking on the go.  Even moderate ABLE workouts burn 200 - 300 calories in 20 minutes. 
Equipment.  No other piece of equipment offers this much functionality in such a small, simple and portable package.  ABLE's multi-directional movement takes body weight training to a whole new level. 
Watch This.  Our first factory samples just arrived!


 

    
Beginner?  Start with a huge number of modified strength, weight loss and balance moves from the knees.  Use our web app to review proper form and target specific muscles.
Advanced?  Try adding a weight vest for the strength and mass building moves you usually perform at the gym with free weights.
Somewhere in between?  ABLE is scalable for all fitness levels.  And, with hundreds of moves and move variations, you'll have no problem mixing up your routine to keep your muscles guessing.
Ready to start a program that will change your life? 
Here it is.

My daily meditation, especially in the hot room, is what I use these days to keep myself well, happy, and productive!I am a professional massage therapist, and have a true passion for it.  Yoga is such a perfect complement to my career. I have a great working knowledge of anatomy and physiology. I practice the yoga that I'll be training to teach regularly (5-7 days a week). I have also worked as  personal trainer in the recent past.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>So what's the story?</h3>
<p>Water polo at Centennial High School is a Cinderella story. But, it's the part of the story BEFORE the ball.</p>
<p>Washing cars, twirling signs for discount furniture, serving burgers, selling rootbeer, diving for cans- they've done it all.</p>
<p>Problem is, it costs $9000 to fund the season. They made one cut off by raising $5k before September 1. Now, they need to raise another $4k by October 1. Or they turn into pumpkins.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>ABOUT US:<br/></strong></strong></h2>
<p><strong><strong>Hello, my name is M Todd Gilbert and I created the SPORT RAZOR. </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Girls talk about how hairy backs are so gross and they would never date a guy with a hairy back. Unfortunately as I became older, I started to get some hair on my back. Although there wasn't much hair on my back, I was very selfconscious about it. I couldn't find anything on the market I could use to shave my back. So after much thought I came up with the idea of the SPORT RAZOR. I had the basic design right away but through some trial and error there were changes made until we reached the final product. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The more I thought about it and talked to other people I realized there is a  wider application including people having limited mobility.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Since I have used all my own money to finanace this project, <strong>I could have never got this idea off the ground had it not been<strong> for my project management experience in the area of manufacturing and finance. This has been my dream. I have taken my dream as far as I can go but with your help, I can make my dream become a reality of having a Direct Response Television (DRTV) ad!</strong></strong></strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>A DRTV ad is short infomercial ad you frequently see on TV. Some examples would be Oxi Clean, Chia Pet, etc.<br/></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>

Friends,</p>
<p>Catalyst Productions is a Charlottesville, Virginia-based
non-profit organization committed to social responsibility.  We ask your help in responding to the recent water
crisis in West Virginia, a dire situation worsening by the minute and receiving
no appropriate attention, no needed investment.  Over 300,000 residents have no access to
safe tap water.  No bathing.  Nothing to drink.  </p>
<p>On January 9<sup>th</sup> a coal-cleaning chemical was
spilled into the Elk River, one of West Virginia’s most vital water sources.  The infrastructure devastation is
massive.  There is no funding plan for
relief.  The offending company has filed
for bankruptcy and has abandoned residents. 
Day-to-day conditions are heartbreaking. 
</p>
<p>Catalyst Productions is answering the call to respond through
<b><i>Operation
FreeFlow</i></b><i>.  </i>On January 25<sup>th</sup> Catalyst
partnered with Sanger Carpentry, Appalachian Voices, and other corporate
sponsors to host a benefit concert at the Jefferson Theater in downtown
Charlottesville.  This crucial first
event provided an opportunity to raise awareness about folks enduring with no
real help in sight, to channel resources for immediate bottled water relief,
and to begin the work of establishing an endowment for comprehensive
infrastructure restoration in West Virginia.  We have already trucked 44 tons of water to
the victims of the water crisis, barely a drop in the tank.  This work is just the beginning.</p>
<p>  Our next step is an indoor Local
Wine, Craft Beer, Visual Art and Music Festival at downtown Charlottesville’s
historic Paramount Theater on Sunday, March 23<sup>rd</sup>—the next of several
future benefit events to support Catalyst’s continued investment in addressing
the problem in West Virginia.</p><p>Catalyst
asks for your support through donations to help us achieve our goal of
extending Operation FreeFlow’s impact as far and wide as possible.  Our target amount is $25,000.  We hope to raise much more than that.  Contributions from private donors will not
only yield necessary funding for our operating budget for the March 23<sup>rd</sup>
event at the Paramount, but also provide financial resources crucial to our aspirations
of  mounting additional escalating benefit
concerts this spring and summer, additional bottled water relief, and the inital consultations on a meaningul infrastructure solution.</p>
<p>  The clock is ticking.  Recent reports on the ground in West Virginia
paint a gruesome picture.  The time to
move is now.  If you are ready to join
this important cause, please donate today.</p>
<p>  Thank you for your
consideration.  Join us.  Let’s fix this problem.  People are suffering.  They need us. 
Let’s let them hear from the good people of Charlottesville, the Commonwealth,
and beyond.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ian Babcock</p>

Friends,
Catalyst Productions is a Charlottesville, Virginia-based
non-profit organization committed to social responsibility.  We ask your help in responding to the recent water
crisis in West Virginia, a dire situation worsening by the minute and receiving
no appropriate attention, no needed investment.  Over 300,000 residents have no access to
safe tap water.  No bathing.  Nothing to drink.  
On January 9th a coal-cleaning chemical was
spilled into the Elk River, one of West Virginia’s most vital water sources.  The infrastructure devastation is
massive.  There is no funding plan for
relief.  The offending company has filed
for bankruptcy and has abandoned residents. 
Day-to-day conditions are heartbreaking. 

Catalyst Productions is answering the call to respond through
Operation
FreeFlow.  On January 25th Catalyst
partnered with Sanger Carpentry, Appalachian Voices, and other corporate
sponsors to host a benefit concert at the Jefferson Theater in downtown
Charlottesville.  This crucial first
event provided an opportunity to raise awareness about folks enduring with no
real help in sight, to channel resources for immediate bottled water relief,
and to begin the work of establishing an endowment for comprehensive
infrastructure restoration in West Virginia.  We have already trucked 44 tons of water to
the victims of the water crisis, barely a drop in the tank.  This work is just the beginning.
  Our next step is an indoor Local
Wine, Craft Beer, Visual Art and Music Festival at downtown Charlottesville’s
historic Paramount Theater on Sunday, March 23rd—the next of several
future benefit events to support Catalyst’s continued investment in addressing
the problem in West Virginia.Catalyst
asks for your support through donations to help us achieve our goal of
extending Operation FreeFlow’s impact as far and wide as possible.  Our target amount is $25,000.  We hope to raise much more than that.  Contributions from private donors will not
only yield necessary funding for our operating budget for the March 23rd
event at the Paramount, but also provide financial resources crucial to our aspirations
of  mounting additional escalating benefit
concerts this spring and summer, additional bottled water relief, and the inital consultations on a meaningul infrastructure solution.
  The clock is ticking.  Recent reports on the ground in West Virginia
paint a gruesome picture.  The time to
move is now.  If you are ready to join
this important cause, please donate today.
  Thank you for your
consideration.  Join us.  Let’s fix this problem.  People are suffering.  They need us. 
Let’s let them hear from the good people of Charlottesville, the Commonwealth,
and beyond.
Sincerely,
Ian Babcock

</b><p><b>We are so happy to be able to offer you our new creation;</b></p><p></p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1363211/files/20150407121313-Giro0_15.gif?1428433993"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>This sandal is the result of close teamwork between Lina Rodriguez Conde, specialist in Zonal Reflexology, and Astrid Weissenborn-Garcia, artist and sculptor.</p>
<p>We came together in order to create a sandal which would stimulate the areas on the soles of the feet where you find the reflex projections of our main energy centers, our internal organs and tissues.</p>
<p>All you have to do to benefit from this stimulation is walk around while wearing <i>Yol Sandals</i>.</p>
<p>‘YOL’ in the Turkish language means ‘way/path’. And walking with <i>Yol Sandals</i> is precisely the ‘way’ to reap the benefits of the gentle stimulation on the soles of your feet from the carefully designed, raised texture of the sandals.</p>
<p>(See:  What is Zonal Reflexology?)</p>
<p>Here are some of the questions you might have:</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1352758/files/20150403120335-Questions.jpg?1428087815"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><div>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Simply wearing <i>Yol Sandals</i> will improve our levels of energy and general well- being without having to follow any specific therapy. Clearly, <i>Yol Sandals</i> can never replace the hands of an expert therapist, yet the gentle stimulation generated by the precise, irregular surface of the sandals can help maintain the positive effects of therapy during and after treatment as well as have a harmonizing effect in general, freeing us from many aches and pains.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1352786/files/20150403121018-Question2.jpg?1428088218"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>We all know that Nature and life itself follow a rhythm. We recommend using <i>Yol Sandals</i> regularly. This way, our internal rhythms of self regulation are strengthened.  Get used to <i>Yol Sandals</i> gradually, beginning with 10 minutes the first few days and increasing their use little by little, making sure you feel comfortable. Keep in mind that wearing Yol Sandals as we move about will help us start the day with positive energy as well as finish the day feeling more relaxed, promoting a deeper and more reparative night’s sleep.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1352788/files/20150403121050-Question3.jpg?1428088250"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>No.                                                                                                                              </p>
<p>For those of us who have no time to spare, this is especially good news.  Start your day with <i>Yol Sandals</i>: when you come out of the shower, as you do things around the house, when you go to the pool or the beach, enjoy the garden or take your dog for a walk, etc. …. whenever it is convenient and comfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1352791/files/20150403121109-Question4.jpg?1428088269"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Either way is fine! Yol Sandals are for all 365 days of the year!</p>
<p>You can wear them with or without socks! If your feet are cold, do whatever will keep you comfortable.  Depending on your reflex sensitivity, you will be able to notice the stimulation from the irregular surface of <i>Yol Sandals</i> even through your socks.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1312965/files/20150321085119-Untitled-2.png?1426953079"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","We are so happy to be able to offer you our new creation;
This sandal is the result of close teamwork between Lina Rodriguez Conde, specialist in Zonal Reflexology, and Astrid Weissenborn-Garcia, artist and sculptor.
We came together in order to create a sandal which would stimulate the areas on the soles of the feet where you find the reflex projections of our main energy centers, our internal organs and tissues.
All you have to do to benefit from this stimulation is walk around while wearing Yol Sandals.
‘YOL’ in the Turkish language means ‘way/path’. And walking with Yol Sandals is precisely the ‘way’ to reap the benefits of the gentle stimulation on the soles of your feet from the carefully designed, raised texture of the sandals.
(See:  What is Zonal Reflexology?)
Here are some of the questions you might have:
Yes.
Simply wearing Yol Sandals will improve our levels of energy and general well- being without having to follow any specific therapy. Clearly, Yol Sandals can never replace the hands of an expert therapist, yet the gentle stimulation generated by the precise, irregular surface of the sandals can help maintain the positive effects of therapy during and after treatment as well as have a harmonizing effect in general, freeing us from many aches and pains.



We all know that Nature and life itself follow a rhythm. We recommend using Yol Sandals regularly. This way, our internal rhythms of self regulation are strengthened.  Get used to Yol Sandals gradually, beginning with 10 minutes the first few days and increasing their use little by little, making sure you feel comfortable. Keep in mind that wearing Yol Sandals as we move about will help us start the day with positive energy as well as finish the day feeling more relaxed, promoting a deeper and more reparative night’s sleep.


No.                                                                                                                              
For those of us who have no time to spare, this is especially good news.  Start your day with Yol Sandals: when you come out of the shower, as you do things around the house, when you go to the pool or the beach, enjoy the garden or take your dog for a walk, etc. …. whenever it is convenient and comfortable.



Either way is fine! Yol Sandals are for all 365 days of the year!
You can wear them with or without socks! If your feet are cold, do whatever will keep you comfortable.  Depending on your reflex sensitivity, you will be able to notice the stimulation from the irregular surface of Yol Sandals even through your socks.







Simply brushing the sandals with a dry brush is usually enough.  If necessary, you can also use soap and water. Afterwards, place the sandals upside-down to dry completely with the straps open.

<p style=""background-color: initial;"">Doctors, psychologists and health care professionals have
recommended the use of My Therapy Buddy for individuals suffering from
depression, anxiety, trauma, or end of life issues.  My Therapy Buddy responds to the
squeeze of a person in need, speaking and reassuring them that <i>“Everything is going to be all right”. </i>This
phrase creates a cascade of physiological responses in a human body, kicking
joy and love into overdrive. As a result, MTB makes the person feel good.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>W</b><b>hat is My Therapy Buddy (MTB)?  </b><span>MTB is a transitional
object, in the form of a personal companion primarily designed for the
internalization of various maternal-like functions which are considered to be
the building blocks of our psychic structure. It’s a wonderfully soft and
huggable friend that offers great tactile contact, and provides soothing and
comforting words which are beneficial to one’s emotional well being.</span></p>
<p><b>W</b><b>hat is a transitional object?  </b><span>Typically, the
transitional object is a baby blanket, teddy bear, doll, or stuffed animal
cherished by a young child who carries everywhere and sleeps with it for
comfort and soothing. There is no reason why this soothing function cannot
benefit adults as well. In clinical terms is the halfway point between
receiving comfort and nurturing from a mother or other primary caregiver and
total reliance on the self. It performs soothing functions and the development
of enduring psychic structures which eventually permits self-healing. In
everyday language a transitional object taps into the natural self preservation
instinct we all have. When we are at our emotionally lowest point and we feel
hopeless, there always is a reservoir of resilience inside us. The transitional
object can make us aware of this natural self-healing instinct and guide us

<b>How does MTB Work?  </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Once in the privacy of your
home, or other comfortable location, the soft and huggable companion can be
accessed any time you need it. The person being held by MyTherapyBuddy can
activate the comforting messages by applying slight pressure to either the
right or the left foot. The design, research and development for MTB realized
that the shape, materials and the words that MTB speaks are universal signals
to the brain that can be accessed by people in distress, any time, any place.
We know that almost all of our worst fears are created in our minds, that’s why
the very specific words MTB speaks have a positive, calming effect on people in
a time of urgent need. After prolonged repeated use, the effect becomes a
permanent soothing component in that person’s healing process. </span><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>                             (</i></a><a href=""http://www.mytherapybuddy.com/clinical-info.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>See clinical description for specific

<h3><b>   Theoretical Underpinnings for My Therapy Buddy</b></h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My Therapy Buddy is the result of research based on a major Winnicottian contribution to the theory of personality, the concept of the seemingly universal need of a transitional object. (1954, 1960). Donald Woods Winnicott possessed a profound appreciation for the developmental tasks of life’s earliest stages, and in particular, for the role of “the other”. For Winnicott, the fundamental aspect of human experience, a paradox really, was the need for the other to become one’s self. In a most important paper he points out the fact that the capacity to be alone rests upon the capacity to be alone in the presence of the other (1958). In other words, one cannot speak of “self” without at the same time speaking of the “other”. Winnicott’s best-known concept, the transitional object (1951), has been adopted within the framework of psychotherapy. The transitional object is a halfway point between total reliance on the actual presence of the self-object to perform soothing functions and the development of enduring psychic structures within the self which permits self-soothing. The transitional object in the form of a blanket, imaginary companion, or special toy in childhood allows the child to keep the mother/self object present in the child’s consciousness, even in the absence of the mother. In the same vein, adults who have not been able to internalize a “good object” in childhood, need a soothing self object when experiencing anxiety and or depression. Life transitions precipitate strains within the individual due to the stimulation of existing internal conflicts and heightened disequilibrium between the self and the environment. My Therapy Buddy reduces this strain and allows for the regaining of equilibrium, thus helping individuals to cope with past and present trauma, anxiety, depression, and psychic pain. My Therapy Buddy acts as a vehicle for the “internalization” of various maternal-like functions which are considered to be the building blocks of psychic structure and an “optimal” fit with the environment.

          Frequently AskedQuestions

What is My Therapy Buddy (MTB)?  MTB is a transitional
object, in the form of a personal companion primarily designed for the
internalization of various maternal-like functions which are considered to be
the building blocks of our psychic structure. It’s a wonderfully soft and
huggable friend that offers great tactile contact, and provides soothing and
comforting words which are beneficial to one’s emotional well being.
What is a transitional object?  Typically, the
transitional object is a baby blanket, teddy bear, doll, or stuffed animal
cherished by a young child who carries everywhere and sleeps with it for
comfort and soothing. There is no reason why this soothing function cannot
benefit adults as well. In clinical terms is the halfway point between
receiving comfort and nurturing from a mother or other primary caregiver and
total reliance on the self. It performs soothing functions and the development
of enduring psychic structures which eventually permits self-healing. In
everyday language a transitional object taps into the natural self preservation
instinct we all have. When we are at our emotionally lowest point and we feel
hopeless, there always is a reservoir of resilience inside us. The transitional
object can make us aware of this natural self-healing instinct and guide us
back to a healthy balance of mind, body, and spirit.

How does MTB Work?  Once in the privacy of your
home, or other comfortable location, the soft and huggable companion can be
accessed any time you need it. The person being held by MyTherapyBuddy can
activate the comforting messages by applying slight pressure to either the
right or the left foot. The design, research and development for MTB realized
that the shape, materials and the words that MTB speaks are universal signals
to the brain that can be accessed by people in distress, any time, any place.
We know that almost all of our worst fears are created in our minds, that’s why
the very specific words MTB speaks have a positive, calming effect on people in
a time of urgent need. After prolonged repeated use, the effect becomes a
permanent soothing component in that person’s healing process.                              (See clinical description for specific
details)
Who are the people being helped by MTB?  MTB can help most
people. Even though MTB is not intended to replace professional counseling, it
is meant to be there between therapy sessions, or other ongoing therapeutic
counseling. We all have moments when nurturing words can ease our mind,
especially from an always available “buddy”.
How much does the 18"" MTB cost?  The price is $69.99 plus shipping,  but it can be reduce by 20% on by getting  your buddy here and now from a perk. At the moment the MTB price is about
half the cost of one hour of professional therapy.  See more at the www.MyTherapyBuddy.com

</h3>
<p>The purpose of the project is to expand our range by launching some exciting new products we've been working on; giving them a full retail launch, with professionally-designed packaging and all the relevant licencing to get them on high-street shelves and available to purchase globally online.</p>
<p>We have a range of 10 products which have been
really well received by our test panel, and we'd like to make them available to
everyone. They have already been formulated and tested (on willing human volunteers - never on
animals!) and are ready to go.  However, as this is a larger scale project than anything we've done previously, we appreciate that this is a significant financial challenge, so we've prioritised 6 of the products for this project with the plan to add
the additional products as 'stretch goals' if we reach our target quickly. <br/></p>
<p>The products we've prioritised are as follows:</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;""><br/>Smokin' Joints Shea Butter Balm</span><br/></p>

Formulated with clove, rosemary, ginger, cypress and chamomile, they're designed to warm tired muscles and ease aching or arthritic joints, helping to keep them supple and reduce inflammation. However, a lot of the folks who use the range regularly asked us for a balm version, as it would be easier to self-apply on hard-to-reach areas like backs and shoulders than a traditional liquid massage oil.</span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">It was originally designed to help ease arthritic and musculoskeletal pain, but our customers tell us it's also a fantastic post-workout rub, as the same properties that keep warmth in joints and muscles to ease stiffness and improve mobility also extend muscle cooldown post-workout, reducing the aches the next day.</span><br/></p>
<p>The balm is a 100% natural product, made with fairtraded and sustainably sourced ingredients, including organic fairtrade shea butter, cold-pressed olive oil, British beeswax and natural botanical extracts. There are no added colours, perfumes, preservatives or petrochemical ingredients. The balm is suitable for vegetarians.</p>

<h3>The Derminator Skin Repair Serum</h3>
<p><br/>'The Derminator' really is bringing out the 'big guns' when it comes to fixing skin stuff! A gentle, natural serum in an easy-to-use spray, The Derminator is packed with 15 different botanicals, and designed to soothe even the angriest skin, including eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis and skin reactions. Packed with some of nature's best ingredients from around the World, including cold-pressed rosehip oil, Moroccan argan oil, fairtrade jojoba, evening primrose seed oil and organic fairtrade shea and cocoa butters, and enriched with natural Vitamin E and St Johns Wort; The Derminator is our most technically advanced product to date.<br/><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>It's designed to even out skin tone, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars over time, and has been challenge tested against some of the market-leading products with much higher price tags with excellent results (can you tell we're really proud of this one?). It's 100% natural, with no added colours, perfumes, preservatives or petrochemical ingredients, and is suitable for vegans.</p>Here's what some of our testers had to say:<br/><br/><b>""</b><i>My hands are prone to drying out of the skin, leading to dermatitis, when exposed to cold/wet for prolonged periods of time. I was lucky enough to be trialling Bimble’s 'Derminator' oil during a recent camping/kayaking holiday and at the first sign of dryness across my knuckles started applying it to my hands. Not only did it prevent the problem progressing any further, it also cleared up the dryness that had already occurred. Would definitely recommend!"" </i><br/><div style=""text-align: right;""><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Sami, North-East Lincolnshire</b></div>
<b><br/></b><p><i>""I had a chafing rash under my boobs from an allergic reaction to fabric softener that was taking forever to go away. In fact it wasn't going away on its own and I was using coconut oil but all that did was treat the itching. Well it's gone now thanks to this oil. In about two weeks - all healed.<br/><br/>I also noticed that my stretch marks don’t feel as bumpy I have some bad ones on my tummy under my navel and it feels less like serious tears in my skin. I notice the ones on my stomach are blending in skin tone wise, they are still there but they are less light coloured, in just 2 weeks. Given that I think they show up more on black skin, this is an achievement!</i></p>
<p><i>The way things are going I think six months of continuous use would repair my skin drastically. The product surpassed my expectations. I am so happy about the chafing healing, it was really an issue that I did not want to use medication for. Thank you!""</i><br/></p>

<h1><b><b><h3>
<br/>Swindler's Secret Oil</h3></b></b></h1>
<b>
<br/></b><p></p>
<p>'Swindler's Secret' started life as a 14th century recipe, when it was still believed that 'bad smells' were the cause of  infection. The solution at the time was to mask bad odours. It was discovered by trial and error that certain scents were more effective than others, even though they didn't have the scientific capability to learn why. We now know that it's because certain substances have antimicrobial properties and, because diseases are caused by pathogens which are killed by some of these substances, 'scents' can prevent certain airborne infections.</p>
<p>This learning was of use to grave robbers - also known as  'body snatchers'. As human dissection was largely illegal, scientists, doctors and anatomy lecturers had to find alternative means of securing remains for scientific use, hence the use of 'body snatchers'.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443703719/nr4dbsobxfpbvci7rjhi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 321.333px;height: 241px;""/></i></b></p>
<b><i>Swindler's Secret Botanicals</i></b><br/><p></p>
<p>To protect themselves, 'body snatchers' are said to have used an aromatic blend to prevent the 'bad smells' making them ill, and many versions of this formula still exist today. Modern scientific peer-reviewed trials of this formula have shown that it kills a huge number of bacteria, viruses and fungi,  including otherwise resilient 'superbugs' like MRSA and C.Diff.</p>
<p>We've taken the original formula and made some slight amendments, maintaining the 'bug bashing' properties, but adding natural bronchodialators and decongestant to expand its potential uses, making it ideal for colds, 'flu, sinus and respiratory infections and similar problems, as well as to aid controlling the symptoms of asthma and even CF (in conjunction with conventional therapies). It can also be used as a topical antiseptic.</p>
<p>Our formula is 100% natural, suitable for vegans and made with pure botanical extracts only. Here's what some of our testers had to say:<br/><br/><i>""As an asthmatic, I am prone to chest infections which can have serious consequences. Using the Swindler's Secret Oil with steam inhalation has proved very effective at stopping infections in their tracks as well as being a comforting and pleasant way to ease the breathing.""</i><br/></p>
<div style=""text-align: right;""><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Su, Bristol</b></div>
<b><br/></b><i>""I got this cold, which turned into a chest infection, which turned into another chest infection (quite frankly, it was just ongoing for weeks and weeks). The doctor had given me so many different antibiotics that I felt I was rattling, and yet it just kept coming back, or probably never went away. I jumped at the chance to try Swindler's Secret (quite frankly, I'd have tried anything at that point), and my symptoms were gone after a week of daily use. The bottle now has a permanent place in my medicine cabinet, and comes out at the first sign of a sniffle. I've also used it to sterilise cuts I've picked up working outdoors, and it's a lot more pleasant to use than liquid antiseptic - it smells nice and doesn't sting!""</i><br/><div style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Steve, Lancashire </b></span></div>
<br/><h3>Risks and Challenges<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/>The risks and challenges associated with this project are very low - we have developed these products quite extensively before setting up this project. We already have the packaging designs in progress, the products tested with lab approvals pending, and the materials suppliers in place. Additionally, we have already vetted suppliers regarding animal testing and sustainability of supply, as well as environmental assessments, all in accordance with our company environmental and social responsibility policies.</p>
<p>We have secondary sources of supply for everything from the packaging and printers to the ingredients suppliers, so there are contingencies in place should we experience any difficulties with supply.</p>
<p>Our only potential issue is meeting deadlines if we get a much larger response than we anticipate but, rest assured, we'll be working around the clock to make sure everyone gets their rewards as soon as the project closes, and certainly within the stated delivery times.<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","What's The Project About?

The purpose of the project is to expand our range by launching some exciting new products we've been working on; giving them a full retail launch, with professionally-designed packaging and all the relevant licencing to get them on high-street shelves and available to purchase globally online.
We have a range of 10 products which have been
really well received by our test panel, and we'd like to make them available to
everyone. They have already been formulated and tested (on willing human volunteers - never on
animals!) and are ready to go.  However, as this is a larger scale project than anything we've done previously, we appreciate that this is a significant financial challenge, so we've prioritised 6 of the products for this project with the plan to add
the additional products as 'stretch goals' if we reach our target quickly. 
The products we've prioritised are as follows:
Smokin' Joints Shea Butter Balm
Our Smokin' Joints range of bath and massage products are some of the most popular in our range. Formulated with clove, rosemary, ginger, cypress and chamomile, they're designed to warm tired muscles and ease aching or arthritic joints, helping to keep them supple and reduce inflammation. However, a lot of the folks who use the range regularly asked us for a balm version, as it would be easier to self-apply on hard-to-reach areas like backs and shoulders than a traditional liquid massage oil.


Our Existing Smokin' Joints Massage Oil

It was originally designed to help ease arthritic and musculoskeletal pain, but our customers tell us it's also a fantastic post-workout rub, as the same properties that keep warmth in joints and muscles to ease stiffness and improve mobility also extend muscle cooldown post-workout, reducing the aches the next day.
The balm is a 100% natural product, made with fairtraded and sustainably sourced ingredients, including organic fairtrade shea butter, cold-pressed olive oil, British beeswax and natural botanical extracts. There are no added colours, perfumes, preservatives or petrochemical ingredients. The balm is suitable for vegetarians.
Now, we could tell you how great we think it is, but we'd rather our customers did that, so here's some feedback from our testers and massage oil customers:
""I have a very dodgy back and I've been using Bimble’s Smokin’ Joints balm for the better part of a year and it's amazing! When my back decides to play up the balm gets the muscles back to cooperating within a day or so. I love the stuff to the point I keep handing it off to friends and family for everything from post workout ouchies to my Dads arthritis... although I always make sure I keep a stock for myself!""
Dawn, Galway


""As someone who's abused her muscles & joints over more years than is sensible, I can hand on heart say that until I found Smokin' Joints I had never found a warming rub that:
1 - Works on both muscles AND joints - muscle rubs don't tend to be robust enough for hands, wrists, knees & ankles, & joint rubs tend to be far too vicious for use on muscles.2 - Smells nice! Yes, I know, there are more important things, but for me it has to smell good too!3 - Multi-purpose - I used the oil for large areas (brilliant for back massage... mmm...), knees and hips, and the balm was perfect for hands, feet and the small of my back, plus the balm was fantastic for taking with me everywhere I went, as there was no risk of leaking.4 - Fantastic value for money - a little goes a very long way.5 - Knowing the provenance of the product - Being absolutely 100% confident in the quality of the ingredients, that everything has been ethically & sustainably sourced, tested without cruelty, & made as naturally as possible.You can keep your nasty chemically burny products, I'll stick to the yummy spicy warming Smokin' Joints!""

Smokin' Joints Depth Charge Fizzy Bath Treats

Flower Power Healing Balm
'Flower Power' is designed to lend a hand to skin in crisis! Originally designed for someone whose arm was coming out of a cast, it's been used for everything from dry and itchy skin to soothing skin reactions, wind burn and chapped skin, chafing, contact dermatitis, callouses and even post-operative sites once the stitches had dissolved. It also doubled up as a handy cream for dry skin, especially hands, elbows, knees and feet.

Flower Power Healing BalmIt's incredibly gentle, made from simple, 100% natural ingredients, including cold-pressed rosehip oil, organic fairtrade shea butter, and plenty of soothing and repairing essential oils to help get skin back in shape! There are no added colours, perfumes, preservatives or petrochemical ingredients, and Flower Power is suitable for vegetarians. It also smells delicious!
Here's what some of our testers had to say:
""Flower Power Healing balm took away the itchiness from my healing scar tissue and has become the go-to balm for any skin complaints in our family. From 10 year olds to 74 year olds, the response is the same: this smells amazing and stops the itch giving the skin a chance to heal. It's also a fabulous post shave balm for legs! Why have half a dozen skin creams for different jobs when you can have one?""
Anna, Gloucestershire

""I had a really painful rash which had started as prickly heat, but kept spreading and becoming more inflamed, which I was worried was getting infected. Conventional antiseptic cream was doing nothing, so I was pleased to try Flower Power instead. It was so gentle, instantly soothed the pain and itch, and the rash itself was completely gone in a few days. I'm now using it on annoying dry patches on my elbows, knees and heels, and its doing wonders for them, too!""

The Derminator Skin Repair Serum
'The Derminator' really is bringing out the 'big guns' when it comes to fixing skin stuff! A gentle, natural serum in an easy-to-use spray, The Derminator is packed with 15 different botanicals, and designed to soothe even the angriest skin, including eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis and skin reactions. Packed with some of nature's best ingredients from around the World, including cold-pressed rosehip oil, Moroccan argan oil, fairtrade jojoba, evening primrose seed oil and organic fairtrade shea and cocoa butters, and enriched with natural Vitamin E and St Johns Wort; The Derminator is our most technically advanced product to date.


It's designed to even out skin tone, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars over time, and has been challenge tested against some of the market-leading products with much higher price tags with excellent results (can you tell we're really proud of this one?). It's 100% natural, with no added colours, perfumes, preservatives or petrochemical ingredients, and is suitable for vegans.Here's what some of our testers had to say:""My hands are prone to drying out of the skin, leading to dermatitis, when exposed to cold/wet for prolonged periods of time. I was lucky enough to be trialling Bimble’s 'Derminator' oil during a recent camping/kayaking holiday and at the first sign of dryness across my knuckles started applying it to my hands. Not only did it prevent the problem progressing any further, it also cleared up the dryness that had already occurred. Would definitely recommend!"" Sami, North-East Lincolnshire
""I had a chafing rash under my boobs from an allergic reaction to fabric softener that was taking forever to go away. In fact it wasn't going away on its own and I was using coconut oil but all that did was treat the itching. Well it's gone now thanks to this oil. In about two weeks - all healed.I also noticed that my stretch marks don’t feel as bumpy I have some bad ones on my tummy under my navel and it feels less like serious tears in my skin. I notice the ones on my stomach are blending in skin tone wise, they are still there but they are less light coloured, in just 2 weeks. Given that I think they show up more on black skin, this is an achievement!
The way things are going I think six months of continuous use would repair my skin drastically. The product surpassed my expectations. I am so happy about the chafing healing, it was really an issue that I did not want to use medication for. Thank you!""
Juanita, St Lucia
""I've used Bimble products before, so expected it to be good. But the serum far surpassed my expectations. It worked far better than any similar products I've used in the past too. I saw some definite changes within just a few days on several skin issues & the results lasted even after I stopped using the oil. I've already re-ordered it and would highly recommend.""
Claire, Dublin
""The oil is brilliant, it's helped my soften my scars, becoming less painful and my stretch/weight loss marks have shrunk by about a quarter and still have plenty oil in the bottle. It really is a good recipe and its vegan.
My partner burned her finger badly a week ago and the new skin kept drying out badly and healing up tight so she used some of the oil and it became more supple, and the damage is healing a lot faster now.""
Tony, Northumberland

""The formula is perfect because the grains in the scrub are not too big - they are the perfect size so you don't feel like you are scrubbing your lips to the bone...it smells and tastes like actual fruit. When you smell them you just want to eat them!” 
'Make-up Is Life' Beauty Blog Review
“This is absolutely FANTASTIC! It is a great exfoliator and really gets rid of any dead skin on lips. It smells amazing and is organic and Fairtrade - what more could you want?”
Jessica, Yorkshire
""I ordered the Turkish Delight Lip Scrub last week and absolutely LOVE it. My lips are the softest and smoothest they have been in ages...The taste is incredible. Sweet and delicious.”
5 Star Amazon Customer Review 
""The new Cola Bottle flavour tastes of nostalgia, and got my lips smooth after a week of working outside!""
Ellinor, Leeds
""As a matte lipstick wearer, my lips can become dry and flaky. If I'm feeling nervous I peel the skin off them and cause damage to the fresh skin underneath. I've been using the Bimble lip scrubs for a few weeks now and I haven't had any issues with dry lips. I just apply the scrub and use a balm over the top for days when I don't wear lipstick. And for the days I do, it's a good little rescuer for after I've been wearing matte lipstick all day. It tastes great and doesn't have a chemical smell to it, as its al natural. It's completely edible and cruelty free, which is important as an animal lover. I'd recommend these to anyone who needs a little lip TLC.""Harry, Lancashire

Swindler's Secret Oil


'Swindler's Secret' started life as a 14th century recipe, when it was still believed that 'bad smells' were the cause of  infection. The solution at the time was to mask bad odours. It was discovered by trial and error that certain scents were more effective than others, even though they didn't have the scientific capability to learn why. We now know that it's because certain substances have antimicrobial properties and, because diseases are caused by pathogens which are killed by some of these substances, 'scents' can prevent certain airborne infections.
This learning was of use to grave robbers - also known as  'body snatchers'. As human dissection was largely illegal, scientists, doctors and anatomy lecturers had to find alternative means of securing remains for scientific use, hence the use of 'body snatchers'.

Swindler's Secret Botanicals
To protect themselves, 'body snatchers' are said to have used an aromatic blend to prevent the 'bad smells' making them ill, and many versions of this formula still exist today. Modern scientific peer-reviewed trials of this formula have shown that it kills a huge number of bacteria, viruses and fungi,  including otherwise resilient 'superbugs' like MRSA and C.Diff.
We've taken the original formula and made some slight amendments, maintaining the 'bug bashing' properties, but adding natural bronchodialators and decongestant to expand its potential uses, making it ideal for colds, 'flu, sinus and respiratory infections and similar problems, as well as to aid controlling the symptoms of asthma and even CF (in conjunction with conventional therapies). It can also be used as a topical antiseptic.
Our formula is 100% natural, suitable for vegans and made with pure botanical extracts only. Here's what some of our testers had to say:""As an asthmatic, I am prone to chest infections which can have serious consequences. Using the Swindler's Secret Oil with steam inhalation has proved very effective at stopping infections in their tracks as well as being a comforting and pleasant way to ease the breathing.""
Su, Bristol
""I got this cold, which turned into a chest infection, which turned into another chest infection (quite frankly, it was just ongoing for weeks and weeks). The doctor had given me so many different antibiotics that I felt I was rattling, and yet it just kept coming back, or probably never went away. I jumped at the chance to try Swindler's Secret (quite frankly, I'd have tried anything at that point), and my symptoms were gone after a week of daily use. The bottle now has a permanent place in my medicine cabinet, and comes out at the first sign of a sniffle. I've also used it to sterilise cuts I've picked up working outdoors, and it's a lot more pleasant to use than liquid antiseptic - it smells nice and doesn't sting!""Steve, Lancashire 
Risks and Challenges

The risks and challenges associated with this project are very low - we have developed these products quite extensively before setting up this project. We already have the packaging designs in progress, the products tested with lab approvals pending, and the materials suppliers in place. Additionally, we have already vetted suppliers regarding animal testing and sustainability of supply, as well as environmental assessments, all in accordance with our company environmental and social responsibility policies.
We have secondary sources of supply for everything from the packaging and printers to the ingredients suppliers, so there are contingencies in place should we experience any difficulties with supply.
Our only potential issue is meeting deadlines if we get a much larger response than we anticipate but, rest assured, we'll be working around the clock to make sure everyone gets their rewards as soon as the project closes, and certainly within the stated delivery times.

  Above all, thanks for your

with any friends and associates who might be interested.Update: 10th October 2015Firstly, thanks so much for your incredible support! I'm thrilled to say that we have exceeded our initial target already! So, as promised, we're going to seek to introduce the four 'stretch goal' products, if we're able to raise enough to cover the costs. Having taken a survey of customers through our Facebook page, the first we're going to add are two clay-based wash-off cleansers, one for oily and combination skin, and one for normal to dry skin, so there's something for everyone.It will cost us an additional £300 to add these products to the laboratory test programme and packaging origination, so we'll be able to include them if the total raised exceeds £1600. If we reach this stretch target, then we'll look at the next product choice.The products are as follows:French Polish
French polish is designed to thoroughly cleanse oily and combination skin, reducing oiliness without aggressively stripping out moisture, and cleansing right down to the pores. 


French Polish is made with French green clay to deep-cleanse pores, glycerine to soothe and protect skin, oatmeal to gently exfoliate,  coconut oil to remove dirt and impurities, naturally-occurring alpha hydroxy acids to help renew skin and get rid of the dead skin cells which can block pores and dull the complexion, fairtrade Moroccan argan oil to balance skin moisture levels, and lemon and lavender to help reduce the bacteria which cause pimples and break-outs, remove excess oil and aid in healing spots and skin damage.Three King AwesomeThree King Awesome takes it's name from the frankincense essential oil which not only gives it its delicious aroma, but helps to soothe and protect dry and damaged skin. It's designed to nourish skin, gently cleansing without stripping away essential moisture.Three King Awesome is made with fine bentonite clay to deep-cleanse pores, glycerine to soothe and protect skin, ground almonds to gently exfoliate without the harsh nature of so many exfoliants,  coconut oil to remove dirt and impurities, shea butter to add moisture to parched skin, and rose geranium and frankincense to soothe, heal and protect skin, leaving it soft, smooth, moisturised, supple and protected from everyday stresses.Both cleansers are designed as 'dual-purpose' products: they are gentle enough to be used daily as cleansers by wetting skin, taking a small piece (the size of a hazelnut) and gently massaging into the skin before rinsing away; but they can also be used as a periodic 'deep clean' treatment, by placing a thin layer onto the face as a mask and leaving on for 10 minutes before massaging to exfoliate and then rinsing away.Both cleansers are made with 100% natural ingredients, suitable for vegans, and are gentle enough for sensitive skin. They contain no parabens, artificial colours or perfumes, no mineral oil which can clog pores, and no harsh detergents which can strip skin of vital oils. Update: 12th October 2015Wow! That was really quick! We've already exceeded our first 'stretch goal', so the two clay cleansers are definitely going ahead! As we've reached this so quickly, here's our next goal. It will cost us an additional £200 to add the 'Headrush' scalp treatment oil to the laboratory test programme and packaging origination, so we'll be able to include it as well if the total raised exceeds £1800. If we reach this stretch target, then we'll look at the next product choice, which is....Headrush Scalp Treatment Oil'Headrush' is a gentle, soothing treatment oil for itchy, flaky scalps, dandruff and other similar skin complaints. It's a light, gentle treatment oil which is designed to reduce itching, moisturise, help destroy bacterial and fungal causes of itching and flakiness, and reduce dandruff. 
Made with soothing and nourishing jojoba, coconut, rosehip, hemp and olive oils, and fortified with natural Vitamin E, rosemary, lavender, tea tree, St John's wort, West Indian bay, hyssop, juniper and chamomile botanical extracts, Headrush is easy to use and leaves skin moisturised, soothed and smooth and hair supple, shiny and easy to manage without greasiness. To use, massage thoroughly into scalp, leave  on for at least half an hour, then shampoo out.   The treatment oil is made with 100% natural ingredients, suitable for vegans, and is gentle enough for sensitive scalps. It contains no parabens, artificial colours or perfumes, no mineral oil and no detergents which can strip skin and hair of vital oils and make flakiness worse. 

Update: 16th October 2015
As we're so close to our second stretch goal, we've added the penultimate one below. It will cost us an additional £200 to add the 'Hippification' depth charge fizzy bath treats to our existing range, so we'll be able to include it as well if the total raised exceeds £2,000. If we reach this stretch target, then not only will we be able to make these little '60s tribute baths, but we'll have an extra gift for you all as a thank you. You can add the Hippification depth charges to you pledge choices, as we've added a new reward to the 'perks' page, but, if we reach the £2,000 target, then we'll include a FREE Hippification depth charge (or one from our existing range if you prefer) to your reward package for all contributors who pledge £35 or more in total.

Hippification Depth Charge Fizzy Bath Treats
Hippification may as well be a '60s tribute act! Forget your fancy blends of complementary oils, this just has ALL the patchouli! Never mind beads in its hair, it should probably come with it's own Jimi Hendrix Experience LP! 
As with our current Depth Charge collection, they'll be available individually and in packs of 3. As well as enough patchouli to start a Grateful Dead convention, it's also packed with lots of lovely moisturising and skin softening cocoa butter, and absolutely no parabens, artificial colours or perfumes, no mineral oil and no detergents, making it ideal for those with sensitive skin who may not be able to use many mass-produced bath bombs.Immuni-Tea Herbal Infusion
Immuni-Tea is our final stretch goal. It's a light, refreshing blend of sencha green tea, echinacea, astragalus, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, cat's claw and lemon, and flavoured with bergamot for a delicious 'earl grey' taste. Used regularly, it can help support a healthy immune system and help give your body the tools to fight off the winter bugs! It's tasty and easy to make, and has no artificial additives whatsoever - just sustainably-sourced natural herbs, fruits and extracts.


Update: Summer 2016
The project's success has been fantastic and, thanks to our backers, all of the products we aimed to launch have been available on general sale now for a fair few months on our website, on the shelves at our 5 high street distributors, and via our webstores here, and on Etsy, Amazon and EBay. All of the products are held in stock, and we are now shipping the 'In Demand' packages within 1 working day of order placement.So, here are the finished products:",21.0,0,"4 Campaigns

I am a young transsexual lady from New York City. on April 5th I was chosen as one of 4 women to receive a once in a lifetime opportunity of receiving Genital Reconstruction Surgery (GRS) on May 13th for free. GRS had always seemed like an unattainable goal in my life, and I feel so extremely blessed for the opportunity I have been given!

I am a young transsexual lady from New York City. on April 5th I was chosen as one of 4 women to receive a once in a lifetime opportunity of receiving Genital Reconstruction Surgery (GRS) on May 13th for free.

<p>and....</p>
<p>I have just completed an almost 20-year healing journey that began with diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer when I was 19 years old... at least that is when I devoted my life to healing and began rolling with the changes that healing from childhood incest commands... I am in major transition now to a creative life as a change artist (healer), writer, and compassion activist with an eye on world peace. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I have a few projects in the works, including the writing of an epic tale of original severance and <i>Transcending the Veil, </i>a book that chronicles my spiritual journey from shame to rapture along with the life story of ‘the big stump’ of Calaveras Big Trees State Park. I also have a good bit of poetry coming through and am focused on growing partnerships on Extinction Witness, a creative spiritual regeneration project I seeded in January 2012. <i>Read more on my projects below.</i></p>
<p><b>The writing of <i>Transcending the Veil: A Journey through the Heart of Nature </i>offers closure and larger purpose to the completion of my healing journey. With the writing, I share the bounty of all I have learned.</b></p>
<p>The seeding of Extinction Witness marked my absolute devotion to personal integrity, which for me means heeding my intuition. Since that turning point, I have once again utterly transformed my life. This time, I have fully aligned with my soul and restored Spirit to my being. </p>
<p></p>
<p>During the 9 month 'home stretch' of my healing process, all I could do was maintain the basics for myself and my 3.5 year old son, for whom I was the single primary caregiver at the time. I let go of all work obligations other than my creative projects. I truly could not focus on anything other than the love and creative inspiration flowing through. I am relieved and thrilled to be through the healing process and readied for a life of service directed toward restoring beauty to Earth.</p>
<p>While I thrive in solitude (I am a writer and dreamer after all), there is good reason why practitioners seek refuge in community. Spiritual and psychological regeneration is precarious even for those who prepare for and actively seek heart opening and community provides essential encouragement and nourishment. I would not be here but for those who were present with me from afar and am eternally grateful for them. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">You can read a reflection on my 9 month process at </span><a href=""http://www.elephantjournal.com/2013/09/becoming-a-channel-of-the-earth-kundalini-awakening-megan-hollingsworth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Elephant Journal</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">. </span></p>
<h4>
<b>Right
now,</b>
I am in major transition that includes manifesting steady income and a
move from rural Montana in the interest of being with creative/collaborative friends.<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> I seek refuge in a community of kindred spirits because a supportive and encouraging environment nourishes the home fire which can otherwise exhaust itself.</span> </h4>
<h4>
<b>I
am radically simplifying my life. </b>I
am selling and giving away all in material that I do not use and appreciate
regularly. I just sold my rig, so I am no longer burdened with purchasing
gasoline for solo use and that has me feeling light as a feather!</h4>
<p><i>For
the first that I can recall, I am happy, excited and fully invested in the
present.</i> My happiness is very much grounded as an
abiding faith in humanity and felt experience of life’s longing for itself - a power beyond words. My excitement extends to all far into the
future. So, I am in celebration mode while <i>rather
brilliantly starting from scratch! </i></p>
<h2><b>This
Indiegogo campaign is invitation for you to help ease me into an essentially
creative and ecstatic life of service that naturally comes hand in hand with a wide
open heart.</b></h2>
<p>I am eternally grateful for your support by way
of money, cheers, project collaboration, and shares of this campaign through your social networks! </p>
<p>If you wish, please also read on for some detail
on me, how your pledge will be spent, the projects I have going, and your reward options.</p>

<h1><b>SOME
DETAIL ON ME</b></h1>
<h4>I am a mother, change artist, and compassion
activist.</h4>
<p>As an un-ordained spiritual teacher and
healer, I am reseeding right relationship with birth and death, and confirming
The Golden Rule as a spiritual truth rooted in natural law. </p>
<p>I began identifying myself as water on fire in 2011, having been re-ignited to activism by footage of water catching fire as a result of <a href=""http://www.longtailpipe.com/2013/08/hydraulic-fracturing-causing-water.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=facebook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">horizontal hydraulic fracturing</a> (also known as ‘fracking’) in the film <a href=""http://www.gaslandthemovie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gasland</a>. I did not realize the full
weight of my brand until the first half of 2013, during which I experienced
what can only be described as a spiritually regenerative and purifying love
like wildfire. <i>Read about my resonance with sequoia on my web</i> <a href=""http://www.meganhollingsworth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.meganhollingsworth.com</a></p>
<p>My activist roots are in the Zero Cut and Earth
First! movements. As founder and director at <a href=""http://meganhollingsworth.com/?page_id=41"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Extinction Witness</a>,
I am out to create spiritual regeneration projects essential for the
regeneration of Earth’s cultural and biological diversity. The project
represents the fullness of my healing path, including my formal education
in human anatomy and physiology, psychology, environmental biology,
physics, chemistry, toxicology, and ecology. Extinction Witness stems most immediately
from my activist roots and my graduate study, which explored the human
emotional and spiritual response to genocide and the present mass extinction of
species.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>HOW
YOUR MONEY WILL BE SPENT</b></h2>
<p><i>Someone trusted once told me that high aspirations are supported. I believe him. My vision is deep and wide, and my needs are
simple and pure. I have enough love and joy to feed the world and I am </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><i>ecstatic because I am
ready to share!</i></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">I believe the goal I have set for this campaign will realistically carry me through for two months while I am in transition.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>All
monies received through this Indiegogo campaign will go solely to supporting me
with food, shelter, moving expenses and the basics I need to stay connected
with the world while I am in transition to paid work, during which time I will also
be intensely focused on completing my manuscript.</b></p>
<p>I have <i>Transcending
the Veil </i>fully outlined with the introduction and most of the first chapter
complete. I can finish the manuscript in 7 weeks. See <a href=""http://meganhollingsworth.com/?page_id=903"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TV Table of
Contents</a>.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h2><b>SOME
DETAIL ON MY PROJECTS</b></h2>
<p><b><i>The
Epic Tale of Original Severance</i></b> is in total
gestation with all magic and mystery :-)</p>
<p><b><i>Transcending
the Veil: A Journey through the Heart of Nature </i></b>messages
spiritual and ecological regeneration through the power of divine love. The
book, a compilation of prose and poetry reflects much of what I have learned along the journey of personal healing from embodying
shame to embodying radical joy and Soul-Spirit driven creativity. </p>
<p>Because my heart goes to the whole world, <i>Transcending the Veil</i> weds my journey
with that of humanity and Earth as we heal from the era of human
insecurity. </p>
<p><b>Poems can be read at </b><a href=""http://meganhollingsworth.com/?page_id=37"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Wail

<p><b>Extinction
Witness: </b>Running on the premise that the present <a href=""https://vimeo.com/26854560"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mass
extinction of species</a> is driven by how humans relate
with themselves and all others, Extinction Witness creates and curates
memorials for spiritual regeneration. Extinction Witness serves in the realms
of Spirit and human emotion, also known as energy. Love’s healthy/appropriate emotional
response to loss is weeping. </p>
<p>I’ve been pouring everything I have into
Extinction Witness for the past year and a half. The project is now ripe for organizational and creative partners. So strategic
partnership building is my current focus with this project. You can read more

Trees and Whole Women, <a href=""http://meganhollingsworth.com/?page_id=41"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on my web</a>.

<p>Here is a short introduction to Extinction Witness and <i>'Wildfire a love story</i>', the first finished piece of Virgin.</p>

<h2><b>WHAT
I WANT TO GIVE YOU!</b></h2>
<p>I offer many ‘rewards’ in exchange for your
support, among them all my infinite and eternal gratitude!!! <i>Thank you so much!</i> </p>
<p><i>in case you are wondering on the pledge amounts i've listed with the rewards,</i></p>
<p>i have switched the numbers from the common zeros not to scam you, but because we do not have to count by 5's and 10's and i enjoy summing up numbers within numbers and indeed there is magic in that and this old world is ever ready for some good old-fashioned charming... </p>

Hi! This campaign has run it's course and i am eternally grateful to those who were reached and able to contribute toward my fundraising goal. 

Thank You Thank You Thank You 

One of the greatest blessings of this experience was to reach some clarity on what I have to offer the world right now. I've posted my offering of personalized poems - 'soul re-minders' - to my web and much of what can be read on this Indie campaign page is there as well, please see Mother Lode. 

many thanks and much love, megan

and....
I have just completed an almost 20-year healing journey that began with diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer when I was 19 years old... at least that is when I devoted my life to healing and began rolling with the changes that healing from childhood incest commands... I am in major transition now to a creative life as a change artist (healer), writer, and compassion activist with an eye on world peace. 

I have a few projects in the works, including the writing of an epic tale of original severance and Transcending the Veil, a book that chronicles my spiritual journey from shame to rapture along with the life story of ‘the big stump’ of Calaveras Big Trees State Park. I also have a good bit of poetry coming through and am focused on growing partnerships on Extinction Witness, a creative spiritual regeneration project I seeded in January 2012. Read more on my projects below.
The writing of Transcending the Veil: A Journey through the Heart of Nature offers closure and larger purpose to the completion of my healing journey. With the writing, I share the bounty of all I have learned.
The seeding of Extinction Witness marked my absolute devotion to personal integrity, which for me means heeding my intuition. Since that turning point, I have once again utterly transformed my life. This time, I have fully aligned with my soul and restored Spirit to my being. 

During the 9 month 'home stretch' of my healing process, all I could do was maintain the basics for myself and my 3.5 year old son, for whom I was the single primary caregiver at the time. I let go of all work obligations other than my creative projects. I truly could not focus on anything other than the love and creative inspiration flowing through. I am relieved and thrilled to be through the healing process and readied for a life of service directed toward restoring beauty to Earth.
While I thrive in solitude (I am a writer and dreamer after all), there is good reason why practitioners seek refuge in community. Spiritual and psychological regeneration is precarious even for those who prepare for and actively seek heart opening and community provides essential encouragement and nourishment. I would not be here but for those who were present with me from afar and am eternally grateful for them. You can read a reflection on my 9 month process at Elephant Journal. 

Right
now,
I am in major transition that includes manifesting steady income and a
move from rural Montana in the interest of being with creative/collaborative friends. I seek refuge in a community of kindred spirits because a supportive and encouraging environment nourishes the home fire which can otherwise exhaust itself. 

I
am radically simplifying my life. I
am selling and giving away all in material that I do not use and appreciate
regularly. I just sold my rig, so I am no longer burdened with purchasing
gasoline for solo use and that has me feeling light as a feather!
For
the first that I can recall, I am happy, excited and fully invested in the
present. My happiness is very much grounded as an
abiding faith in humanity and felt experience of life’s longing for itself - a power beyond words. My excitement extends to all far into the
future. So, I am in celebration mode while rather
brilliantly starting from scratch! 
This
Indiegogo campaign is invitation for you to help ease me into an essentially
creative and ecstatic life of service that naturally comes hand in hand with a wide
open heart.
I am eternally grateful for your support by way
of money, cheers, project collaboration, and shares of this campaign through your social networks! 
If you wish, please also read on for some detail
on me, how your pledge will be spent, the projects I have going, and your reward options.
Love, thank you so much!!!
Megan


SOME
DETAIL ON ME
I am a mother, change artist, and compassion
activist.
As an un-ordained spiritual teacher and
healer, I am reseeding right relationship with birth and death, and confirming
The Golden Rule as a spiritual truth rooted in natural law. 
I began identifying myself as water on fire in 2011, having been re-ignited to activism by footage of water catching fire as a result of horizontal hydraulic fracturing (also known as ‘fracking’) in the film Gasland. I did not realize the full
weight of my brand until the first half of 2013, during which I experienced
what can only be described as a spiritually regenerative and purifying love
like wildfire. Read about my resonance with sequoia on my web www.meganhollingsworth.com
My activist roots are in the Zero Cut and Earth
First! movements. As founder and director at Extinction Witness,
I am out to create spiritual regeneration projects essential for the
regeneration of Earth’s cultural and biological diversity. The project
represents the fullness of my healing path, including my formal education
in human anatomy and physiology, psychology, environmental biology,
physics, chemistry, toxicology, and ecology. Extinction Witness stems most immediately
from my activist roots and my graduate study, which explored the human
emotional and spiritual response to genocide and the present mass extinction of
species.

HOW
YOUR MONEY WILL BE SPENT
Someone trusted once told me that high aspirations are supported. I believe him. My vision is deep and wide, and my needs are
simple and pure. I have enough love and joy to feed the world and I am ecstatic because I am
ready to share!
I believe the goal I have set for this campaign will realistically carry me through for two months while I am in transition.
All
monies received through this Indiegogo campaign will go solely to supporting me
with food, shelter, moving expenses and the basics I need to stay connected
with the world while I am in transition to paid work, during which time I will also
be intensely focused on completing my manuscript.
I have Transcending
the Veil fully outlined with the introduction and most of the first chapter
complete. I can finish the manuscript in 7 weeks. See TV Table of
Contents.

SOME
DETAIL ON MY PROJECTS
The
Epic Tale of Original Severance is in total
gestation with all magic and mystery :-)
Transcending
the Veil: A Journey through the Heart of Nature messages
spiritual and ecological regeneration through the power of divine love. The
book, a compilation of prose and poetry reflects much of what I have learned along the journey of personal healing from embodying
shame to embodying radical joy and Soul-Spirit driven creativity. 
Because my heart goes to the whole world, Transcending the Veil weds my journey
with that of humanity and Earth as we heal from the era of human
insecurity. 
Poems can be read at Wail
Dance Blog.
Extinction
Witness: Running on the premise that the present mass
extinction of species is driven by how humans relate
with themselves and all others, Extinction Witness creates and curates
memorials for spiritual regeneration. Extinction Witness serves in the realms
of Spirit and human emotion, also known as energy. Love’s healthy/appropriate emotional
response to loss is weeping. 
I’ve been pouring everything I have into
Extinction Witness for the past year and a half. The project is now ripe for organizational and creative partners. So strategic
partnership building is my current focus with this project. You can read more
on Extinction Witness and our first regeneration project, Virgin: Restoring Big
Trees and Whole Women, on my web.

Here is a short introduction to Extinction Witness and 'Wildfire a love story', the first finished piece of Virgin.




WHAT
I WANT TO GIVE YOU!
I offer many ‘rewards’ in exchange for your
support, among them all my infinite and eternal gratitude!!! Thank you so much! 
in case you are wondering on the pledge amounts i've listed with the rewards,
i have switched the numbers from the common zeros not to scam you, but because we do not have to count by 5's and 10's and i enjoy summing up numbers within numbers and indeed there is magic in that and this old world is ever ready for some good old-fashioned charming... 



'Commencement'

to be in touch by way of a handwritten note from me to you, which comes with
any pledge level AND the opportunity starting at the $27 pledge level for me
to write and send you a poem inspired by a comment, story, and/or memory

or the collection of poems and sketches I offer at the $99 pledge level. 
Poems… I love distilling love to the core...

Here
is a sample of my poetry:


your nose
If you should meet the deepest ocean,
kiss the endless sky,
touch the full moon,
then
will you be convinced?

Will you see yourself bowing before you?
or
Will you stand in place pondering your
nose?

You who desire flight, yet do not see land.
You who desire truth, yet do not listen to
water.
You who desire love, yet do not feel fire.

What can be known

HOW INDIEGOGO WORKS
When you choose to back a creative project/person, you become an essential element in the creative process. 
Your pledge is both vital financial support and a huge “YES!” to the project/person.

Here’s how it works…
Step 1: Be excited to see me reach my funding goal and safely land in community and the creative compassion-infused work that I aspire to.
Step 2: Choose a pledge amount that works for you and, if you wish, choose the Pledge Reward you desire to receive! Minimum pledge is $9 and you can choose any amount from there.
Step 3: Choose a payment method and make your pledge.
Step 4: Let your friends know about this unreasonably joyful woman who is ever grateful for help and encouragement! Facebook, Twitter, blog or email any and all you think may be inspired to help me ease through this grand transition.
Step 5: Check in on this campaign progress. I will post updates, including new poems, book content and the raw logistics of my transition.

<p>My name is Raul, and I am a graduate student at the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. I need your help to do a research project that could change the way you interact with the objects around you. I want to use an Electroencephalography (EEG) sensor (measures your brain waves) to measure a person's concentration and to tell the object in-front of  him or her that this person is engaging with it. In other words if you concentrate on the object in-front of you, let the object know that you want to interact with it. This object for now will be a computer program, but in the future it could be anything. As you can see in the picture, instead of using an EEG I am using my girlfriend's headband, which doesn't measure any brainwaves =(.</p>
<p>I am a graduate student and don't have the money to build a prototype. The good news is that you can help me do it. The cost of labor, I will do for free. Indiegogo does not let me set a goal of less than $500, so any money left after the project as well as all the equipment bought with the money raised will be donated to UMD's Hackerspace <a href=""http://cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://cmsc838f-s15.wikispaces.com/</a> at the end of semester (in May 2015).</p>

Right now I am financing a portion of the costs associated with Zumba® on the Plaza and I am certainly not able to cover this cost for the entire season.  I am just one individual who wants to contribute to the health of our community.  Without a Non-profit status, finding sponsors to help cover cost has been a big challenge this year.  My sponsors are so very important to me because without them, I would not be able to continue this popular event.  
The cost of this event is as follows:
Sound Production: $2700

Print Materials: $400 (banner, posters, rack cards)
Social Media Ads: $200-$300 (ad graphic, ad placement)
Ice, towels and other supplies: $200 All funds will go to cover the cost of this event.I want to give a special thank you to EDGE Fitness here in Rochester.  They are my first Title Sponsor and I am grateful for their partnership!  If you get a chance to stop in to EDGE, please thank them for their support!
5 years ago I never would have thought that I would be in front of a group of people leading a fitness class.  I simply wasn't that brave until I found Zumba® and experienced how it empowered me.  People say I'm crazy, that I could charge admission and cover my cost plus make money, but I absolutely do not want to do this as it goes against everything I wish this event to be.  I want to share Zumba® for free so others can become empowered.
As the health of our country declines, events such as this, that inspire people to lead a more active lifestyle, can have a ripple effect.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/><p>Our friend and Rochester's own Ryan O'Rourke has been very sick lately. So sick, that he has found himself back in the hospital and out of work. He has been diagnosed with Crohn's disease. He is like most of us, living pay check to pay check, which means any extensive time out of work can be very scary. Also, he is not covered under his employers health insurance and he currently doesn't have his own. <br/></p>
<p>So, we are asking all of our friends in the bicycle community of Rochester and all over the world to help Cork out in any way, shape, or form. He is a total badass of bike rider and an even cooler friend so lets all show him some love and support!!<br/></p>
<h3>The Run Down<br/>
</h3>So, the deal is, Cork was sent to the hospital on July 23rd. He had already been out of work for a couple of weeks before that. He most likely will be out of work for quite a long time. It would be awesome to raise a few grand for him so he can actually take care of his bills. A bunch of us in Rochester came together to get the ball rolling on getting Cork some cash.  'The Yea's' own Matt Smith came up with the Corgi Pentagram design that we will be using for our 'perks', which are explained below:<br/><p></p>

Any little bit helps out Cork and if $5 is all you got, then you'll get one hell of a high 5 in return!<br/><h3>$10 - 1 'Cork Is My HomeDawg' Sticker!</h3>
<p>For a $10 pledge, you get your very own 'Cork Is My HomeDawg' Sticker. Let the world know that you give a crap about a friend in need and that the bike community is huge and strong! <br/></p>

<h1><i>If our aging water tanks fail,  we'll lose our golf course.</i></h1>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Powell Golf Club needs your help raising funds so it can renovate its course irrigation water storage facilities.<br/></i><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Two <i>storage tanks are the </i>lifeblood of the course, feeding water throughout the arid high desert landscape — but they are <i>more than 50 years old and <i>deteriorating.</i></i> <br/></i><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">They must be replaced before they fail. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2><i>Before tending to the deteriorating tanks, the board must first retire its $100,000 bank note.</i></h2>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The club's debt was taken on in two massive undertakings — the expansion from 9 to 18 holes in 1994, </i><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">and the re-design of the original 9-hole greens in 2003. The course also faced multiple tough revenue years </i><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">following the loss of many of the greens to winter-kill the winter of 2007-08. <br/></i><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The board has since invested in synthetic greens covers for protection during the off season. </i><i>The covers have proven to be the answer that now help the greens survive northwest Wyoming's bitter cold winters. </i></p>
<h2><i>Fundraising efforts to date... and additional plans for 2015.</i></h2>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Since 2011, the Powell Golf Club Board has worked tirelessly to reduce the club's debt from $260,000 to just $100,000.</i></p>
<p><i><b>The City of Powell plays a key role with its ""Matching Funds Program."" Dollar for dollar, the city will match donations </b></i><i><b>to the club earmarked for debt retirement. </b>Taking advantage of this tremendous opportunity, a number of Powell area businesses have purchased commercial sponsorship <i style=""font-weight: normal;"">signs</i> to be placed on the 18 stone tee markers at each hole. These commitments are for three years, with a possible total of $24,000 per year with all 18 holes sponsored. To date, commitments have been received for more than half of the hole sponsorships. The City of Powell's match of these contributions could  bring that total to $48,000 per year, or $144,000 for three years.</i></p>
<p><i><i>This fall, Powell Golf Club plans to host its annual Debt Reduction Fundraiser Golf Tournament. All proceeds from this event are also available for match by the city.  </i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>Our crowd funding campaign goal is $15,000. If you help us reach this goal, nearly $24,000 total will be raised after the City of Powell ""matching Funds Program."" <b>Choose one of the awesome perks and watch your donation help Powell Golf Club grow! </b></i></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With the matching funds program, our crowdfunding effort, the hole sponsorship opportunities and debt reduction golf tournament, we hope to wipe out the $100,000 note. </i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By retiring that debt, the club can focus on improvements to the irrigation system, ensuring the course thrives in the future.</i></p>

</div></div>","If our aging water tanks fail,  we'll lose our golf course.
The Powell Golf Club needs your help raising funds so it can renovate its course irrigation water storage facilities.Two storage tanks are the lifeblood of the course, feeding water throughout the arid high desert landscape — but they are more than 50 years old and deteriorating. They must be replaced before they fail. 


Before tending to the deteriorating tanks, the board must first retire its $100,000 bank note.
The club's debt was taken on in two massive undertakings — the expansion from 9 to 18 holes in 1994, and the re-design of the original 9-hole greens in 2003. The course also faced multiple tough revenue years following the loss of many of the greens to winter-kill the winter of 2007-08. The board has since invested in synthetic greens covers for protection during the off season. The covers have proven to be the answer that now help the greens survive northwest Wyoming's bitter cold winters. 
Fundraising efforts to date... and additional plans for 2015.

Since 2011, the Powell Golf Club Board has worked tirelessly to reduce the club's debt from $260,000 to just $100,000.
The City of Powell plays a key role with its ""Matching Funds Program."" Dollar for dollar, the city will match donations to the club earmarked for debt retirement. Taking advantage of this tremendous opportunity, a number of Powell area businesses have purchased commercial sponsorship signs to be placed on the 18 stone tee markers at each hole. These commitments are for three years, with a possible total of $24,000 per year with all 18 holes sponsored. To date, commitments have been received for more than half of the hole sponsorships. The City of Powell's match of these contributions could  bring that total to $48,000 per year, or $144,000 for three years.
This fall, Powell Golf Club plans to host its annual Debt Reduction Fundraiser Golf Tournament. All proceeds from this event are also available for match by the city.  
Our crowd funding campaign goal is $15,000. If you help us reach this goal, nearly $24,000 total will be raised after the City of Powell ""matching Funds Program."" Choose one of the awesome perks and watch your donation help Powell Golf Club grow! 
With the matching funds program, our crowdfunding effort, the hole sponsorship opportunities and debt reduction golf tournament, we hope to wipe out the $100,000 note. By retiring that debt, the club can focus on improvements to the irrigation system, ensuring the course thrives in the future.
More than $50,000 raised annually for local organizations and youth!
Our 18-hole golf course helps local organizations raise top dollars. 
Since 1993, The Powell Golf Club has hosted the Powell Medical Foundation's annual ""Heartland Classic"" fundraiser golf tournament. In those 22 years, the foundation has raised a whopping $190,000 from the annual events. More than $20,000 was raised in the 2014 tournament alone. 
 The annual fundraiser event for Northwest College's Trapper Booster Club, the ""Trapper Bonanza"" golf tournament, is an old favorite. In the past four years, it has generated more than $30,000 to support Northwest College athletes, surpassing the $10,000 mark in 2014. The ""Trapper Bonanza"" tournament has been helping recruit student athletes and provide extra athletic gear for more than 30 years.
There are numerous other local organizations which can boast similar numbers ...
Simply put, the funds raised at Powell Golf Club are turned back within our community to support the various organizations’ causes. Teams, clubs and businesses understand the vital role the course plays in their fundraising success. Select a perk and help us ensure Powell Golf Club delivers the green!

<p>To answer that question for me and other beekeeping enthusiasts like me, our team designed the BroodMinder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The BroodMinder is a professional-grade monitor expressly designed for the apiarist. Drawing on our many years of consumer and scientific product design, we have created a device that accurately logs hive temperature and humidity every hour for two years.</p>
<p>When coupled with our iPhone or Android app, it creates a system in which, in a few seconds, the overwintering state of your bee yard may be assessed.</p>
<div>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<div>
<b><h3><b>Update - April 2016 </b></h3></b><p></p>
<p>You may be here because you saw an article in Bee Culture or another blog or from the BroodMinder-W campaign that we just initiated. We're really happy that you found us.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the distribution of our first BroodMinder device, Texas Instruments (TI) recalled the humidity sensor we used because it was inaccurate in a high humidity environment. SIEP#57 recall also fessed up that the sensor would drift up 15% in 18 months. This was devastating news to get.</p>
<p>The BroodMinder-TH Gen 2 device has dropped the TI sensor entirely and incorporated a Sensirion humidity sensor which TI admitted was best in class according to their competitive analysis. We have tested it extensively and found it to be excellent.</p>
<p>We are doing a full recall and will ship, free of charge, replacements to anyone returning the Gen 1 devices. We anticipate delivery beginning June 1st. </p>
<p>We stand fully behind our products with absolute loyalty to our customers.</p>

<h3><b>Update for the Final Week of the Campaign (November 2015)</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I went into this venture believing that all I wanted was a
way to see if my bees were happy throughout the winter. After speaking
with many beekeepers during the launch, my beliefs have shifted.</p>
<p>During the last 10 years the US has been
averaging <b>30% hive loss over winter</b>. Last winter, across the
mid-west numerous states lost more than 60%. Regularly losing that much
livestock in any other agriculture venture would be unfathomable. It drives me
crazy.</p>
<p>The BroodMinder team has developed a professional grade
temperature and humidity monitor expressly for beehives. The entire team has
worked hard to lower the barrier for entry so that the every bee enthusiast may
be part of this national experiment. We see a great will on the part of
beekeepers to contribute to solving this problem as well as understanding more
about their personal hives.</p>
<p><i>The BroodMinder team believes that by performing simple,
uniform measurements on thousands of hives, the beekeeping community will
gain insights into hive distress and we will be able to develop interventions
to improve outcomes. </i></p>
<p>Honeybees are under increasing pressure from many things in
their environment. Everything from monocultures to neonicotinoids. As public
awareness of the stress and importance of bees has grown, scores of new bee
enthusiasts have been born. We see this group as a new and enthusiastic
resource to expand the world’s knowledge base.</p>
<p>In order to encourage community participation, BroodMinder
is committed to providing <b>free software upgrades and data storage</b> to any
purchaser who agrees to share their hive data on our public repository. (For
privacy reasons, only zip codes will be used to identify location.) This data,
collected in a uniform manner will be made available to anyone who would like
to analyze it.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary As a beekeeper, winter is difficult. In the northern US, it can last many months leaving hours and hours to ponder; “I wonder how my bees are doing?”
To answer that question for me and other beekeeping enthusiasts like me, our team designed the BroodMinder.

The BroodMinder is a professional-grade monitor expressly designed for the apiarist. Drawing on our many years of consumer and scientific product design, we have created a device that accurately logs hive temperature and humidity every hour for two years.
When coupled with our iPhone or Android app, it creates a system in which, in a few seconds, the overwintering state of your bee yard may be assessed.



Update - April 2016 
You may be here because you saw an article in Bee Culture or another blog or from the BroodMinder-W campaign that we just initiated. We're really happy that you found us.
Two weeks after the distribution of our first BroodMinder device, Texas Instruments (TI) recalled the humidity sensor we used because it was inaccurate in a high humidity environment. SIEP#57 recall also fessed up that the sensor would drift up 15% in 18 months. This was devastating news to get.
The BroodMinder-TH Gen 2 device has dropped the TI sensor entirely and incorporated a Sensirion humidity sensor which TI admitted was best in class according to their competitive analysis. We have tested it extensively and found it to be excellent.
We are doing a full recall and will ship, free of charge, replacements to anyone returning the Gen 1 devices. We anticipate delivery beginning June 1st. 
We stand fully behind our products with absolute loyalty to our customers.
Please check out our new Indiegogo campaign for the BroodMinder-W beehive scale at igg.me/at/BroodMinder.


We do our best to keep BroodMinder owners and interested parties up to date with the status of the company and products. You will find a link under the contact us page on our website, BroodMinder.com or click HERE to go directly to the sign up page.

We also encourage you to check out our strategic partner beekeeping.io. They are warehousing all of the BroodMinder data and providing free/public access to it. You can log in as user:broodminder, password:broodminder and look around the beta test area.


Update for the Final Week of the Campaign (November 2015)

I went into this venture believing that all I wanted was a
way to see if my bees were happy throughout the winter. After speaking
with many beekeepers during the launch, my beliefs have shifted.
During the last 10 years the US has been
averaging 30% hive loss over winter. Last winter, across the
mid-west numerous states lost more than 60%. Regularly losing that much
livestock in any other agriculture venture would be unfathomable. It drives me
crazy.
The BroodMinder team has developed a professional grade
temperature and humidity monitor expressly for beehives. The entire team has
worked hard to lower the barrier for entry so that the every bee enthusiast may
be part of this national experiment. We see a great will on the part of
beekeepers to contribute to solving this problem as well as understanding more
about their personal hives.
The BroodMinder team believes that by performing simple,
uniform measurements on thousands of hives, the beekeeping community will
gain insights into hive distress and we will be able to develop interventions
to improve outcomes. 
Honeybees are under increasing pressure from many things in
their environment. Everything from monocultures to neonicotinoids. As public
awareness of the stress and importance of bees has grown, scores of new bee
enthusiasts have been born. We see this group as a new and enthusiastic
resource to expand the world’s knowledge base.
In order to encourage community participation, BroodMinder
is committed to providing free software upgrades and data storage to any
purchaser who agrees to share their hive data on our public repository. (For
privacy reasons, only zip codes will be used to identify location.) This data,
collected in a uniform manner will be made available to anyone who would like
to analyze it.


History AreaThe rest of this page documents the campaign as we ended it. We are happy to say that we shipped 500 units in December and have users all over the USA and the world. Here is the installation map for the USA. 


What We Need 
Achieving a 1000+ build quantity reduces the overall cost by 30%. This in turn makes the device much more affordable for enthusiast bee keepers. We need $20,000 to cover the tooling and initial build.
What You Get
There are four options on how you can help.
For $10 we will send you an uber-cute bottlecap bee button, designed by the good folks at bb7. The button is held in place by a pair of magnets so that you can sport it on your blouse or jacket or use it on the refrigerator to hold up your honey-do lists.


For $40, you will receive a BroodMinder. You can see many more details at BroodMinder.com. $40 is our wholesale cost. You will receive one of first units produced in time for Holiday gift giving. It comes in an attractive package that would delight even the likes of Steve Jobs or Jony Ives.

addiction, domestic violence, poverty, mental illness, chronic disease, trauma
and unemployment. We see lots of people not in great shape.  Many struggle to simply sit comfortably on
the floor because back pain is so intense. We provide a gentle respite and
tools to provide comfort and heal. </p>
<p>The daily stresses they grapple with, the challenging
and difficult situation in life put the body in a constant fight-or-flight
state also known as an over stimulated sympathetic nervous system. This can
lead to high blood pressure, anxiety, sleeplessness, and pain. Yoga with its
deep breathing helps to release stress from the body. </p>
<p>For many it is a constant struggle to meet daily
needs: shelter, food, clothing, and hygiene. Calming the mind can seem
impossible. Yoga helps to re-focus the mind. Our teachers create a safe and
non-judgmental space to explore ways to improve their health and well-being,
and provide a slice of peace and quiet. 
The affirmations weaved through class instil hope and courage. On their
mat there is common ground. </p>
<p>Most importantly, we recognize the humanity in each

yoga programs for children and adults in marginalized communities. We bring
qualified yoga instructors to underserved communities and teach tools that
reduce stress, depression and anxiety. Through practice we see marked improvement in confidence,
hopefulness and well-being. We know these tools empower people to take control
over their lives and encourage healthy lifestyle choices that create positive
changes in their lives as well as the community.With your help we will deliver free yoga classes, mats and supplies and volunteer support.Participants at the following sites thank you in advance for your help in furthering their wellness through yoga . Pinellas Hope is a temporary emergency shelter for over 250
homeless men and women. Background checks are done on all the residents and
case managers meet with them on a regular basis to set goals towards
self-sufficiency. They also assist the residents with job and housing placement
and perform follow up visits with them six months after they leave the shelter.Family
Resources - Transitional Living Program is in place for youth 14-17 years old who, due to dysfunctional
families or lack of alternative safe living arrangements, cannot live at home
and can benefit from training in independent living skills. TLP provides safe shelter, food and clothing,
with educational opportunities, individual and group counseling as well as the
training and education necessary to function independently.RCS Grace House provides dignified apartment-style emergency
shelter, to homeless families with children, for up to two months. The program
works one-on-one with families through case management, providing education,
increasing job readiness, and helping families save money in order to secure
stable housing. 90% of families who complete the program move to stable
housing. Future Vision- 100% Growth (people served), Youth Peer Teacher Program, Comprehensive Volunteer Training and Continued Education, Take away tools for all students.Click here and learn more About our Founder and Leadership TeamOur students have diverse backgrounds of drug
addiction, domestic violence, poverty, mental illness, chronic disease, trauma
and unemployment. We see lots of people not in great shape.  Many struggle to simply sit comfortably on
the floor because back pain is so intense. We provide a gentle respite and
tools to provide comfort and heal. 
The daily stresses they grapple with, the challenging
and difficult situation in life put the body in a constant fight-or-flight
state also known as an over stimulated sympathetic nervous system. This can
lead to high blood pressure, anxiety, sleeplessness, and pain. Yoga with its
deep breathing helps to release stress from the body. 
For many it is a constant struggle to meet daily
needs: shelter, food, clothing, and hygiene. Calming the mind can seem
impossible. Yoga helps to re-focus the mind. Our teachers create a safe and
non-judgmental space to explore ways to improve their health and well-being,
and provide a slice of peace and quiet. 
The affirmations weaved through class instil hope and courage. On their
mat there is common ground. 
Most importantly, we recognize the humanity in each
and every student, finding love and compassion for all. Through simple words
like Namaste, they are reminded that we see the goodness in them and we are all
connected. They matter.
""You can never know how timely this was. I feel
so relaxed. My anxiety is lighter. I'm going to do some on my own before you
come back.""""Thank you for coming here for us. Sleeping on a
mat every night takes its toll and this helps.""“Since you started coming here I’ve been really paying
attention to what I put in my body and my attitude. I feel a lot less sad.”“I do it on my own too. I call it tent yoga.”

Help us grow our support network by getting the word out and making some noise about our work in the community and THIS campaign. Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!

properties account for over 4 million visitors a year, which equals almost 11,000
visitors a day.  The resident population
according to the census is 1077 (2010). 
There is no regular recurring financial support from the State or the
County to assist with their portion of the visitor population. </span></b></p></li>
<li><p><b>The District does not get any revenue from the
statewide $150 CalFire fee instituted in 2011.</b></p></li>
<li><p>As a post-Prop 13
District, with more than a $650 million assessed value, less than .04%
($226,000) comes from local property taxes. </p></li>
<li><p>District
taxpayers pay a high special fire tax, which accounts for 60% of the District's
revenue; a typical residence is $524.40 per year or $44 per month.</p></li>
<li><p>Over 65% of the
""total calls"" are to help non-Bodega Bay residents; 80% of medical
transports are for non-Bodega Bay residents.</p></li>
<li><p>Current revenues
to do not increase as fast as inflation.</p></li>
<li><p>Current revenues
are not quite enough to pay for 3 personnel for each of the 3 shifts.<span>  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
recommends 4 firefighters per engine company and 2 firefighters per ambulance.</span></p></li>
<li><p>There is little
residential or commercial growth expected, which limits new tax revenue and

Crowd Sourcing Fundraiser to pay off the Loan that will be need to complete funding $50,000
This Indiegogo fundraising campaign will complete the funding to purchase this much need paramedic ambulance to continue to serve the community and visitors of Bodega Bay, CA

FIRE DISTRICT ISSUES:
THE RISING COST OF BUSINESS HAS EXCEEDED ANNUAL TAX
REVENUE AND RESERVE FUNDS WILL BE DEPLETED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  
A DROP IN STAFFING LEVELS WILL RESULT IN LOWER LEVELS
OF SERVICE AND SLOWER RESPONSE TIMES FOR MULTIPLE INCIDENTS.

A MAJORITY(65%+) OF THE TOTAL CALLS ARE FOR
NON-BODEGA BAY RESIDENTS.


CURRENT AMBULANCE IS NO LONGER RELIABLE TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE.

DISTRICT
BACKGROUND:





Established in
1984 because residents wanted a full-time ambulance and fire fighting
capability in the area.
Provides
emergency medical service, fire suppression, rescue, hazardous material
response, and public assistance over a 34 square mile area to residents and
visitors.  
Averages 480
emergency incidents per year; vast majority are for medical aid versus fire
suppression.
Provides a
""Paramedic"" ambulance; paramedics have advanced life support training
which includes administering IVs and drug therapy, advanced airway techniques,
cardiac monitoring, defibrillation, ETC.
Paramedic
ambulance provides critical link between Bodega Bay and the nearest hospital in
Santa Rosa (40 minutes away) and responds to an additional 216 square mile area
beyond the fire district boundary.
3 paid staff per
shift, including 1 firefighter/paramedic; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  
Paid staff is
augmented with safety volunteers, Non-safety volunteers, reserve
firefighter/EMT’s, and firefighter interns in training.

The last district
fire tax increase was in 2003. The voters rejected a proposed tax increase in
April 2014, with resistance focusing on the current high local fire tax and a
lack of support from the larger community.
INFLUENCING
FACTORS:





Bodega Bay is a tourist destination.  State and County Parks plus commercial
properties account for over 4 million visitors a year, which equals almost 11,000
visitors a day.  The resident population
according to the census is 1077 (2010). 
There is no regular recurring financial support from the State or the
County to assist with their portion of the visitor population. 
The District does not get any revenue from the
statewide $150 CalFire fee instituted in 2011.
As a post-Prop 13
District, with more than a $650 million assessed value, less than .04%
($226,000) comes from local property taxes. 
District
taxpayers pay a high special fire tax, which accounts for 60% of the District's
revenue; a typical residence is $524.40 per year or $44 per month.
Over 65% of the
""total calls"" are to help non-Bodega Bay residents; 80% of medical
transports are for non-Bodega Bay residents.
Current revenues
to do not increase as fast as inflation.
Current revenues
are not quite enough to pay for 3 personnel for each of the 3 shifts.  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
recommends 4 firefighters per engine company and 2 firefighters per ambulance.
There is little
residential or commercial growth expected, which limits new tax revenue and
subsequently keeps us from keeping pace with inflation.
We have
aggressively pursued grants and alternative funding.

Our first-out
engine and ambulance ""service lives"" have been extended by aggressive
maintenance and retrofits in lieu of preferred replacement; therefore, saving
money.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>9) Traducir a otros idiomas.</p>
<p>10) Mejorar la velocidad del cliente.</p>
<p>11) Crear un juego del ciclo de la digestión para que los niños entiendan el equilibrio insulina-glucosa.</p>
<p>Para alcanzar estos
objetivos necesitamos 90.000 USD en este primer esfuerzo de
financiación. Luego queremos mantener el servicio online con
patrocinios y publicidad. Por favor difunda la campaña para que los
diabéticos puedan usar el servicio y contribuir a la financiación.</p>

To reach these
objectives we need 90,000 USD on this first crowdfunding effort. Then
we want to maintain the service online with sponsors and ads. Please
spread the word so diabetics can use the system and contribute the
crowdfunding.
We monitor the donors language. With 1000 USD associated to a language, this become first priority. With 5000 USD on this language, support on that language become first priority.
If you represent a business or organization related to diabetes, please consider to become our sponsor for one year with a 5000 USD contribution. If you represent a health system or payer group and need a system like ours to remote healthcare of your diabetes population, please contact us.
Please stay in touch
with developers on our google+ site or ask
questions on twitter. We support English and Spanish already.
Impact
Your contribution can make our FREE service a reality, serving #diabeticmillions for an improved healthcare and quality of life worldwide, lowering healthcare costs and improving services offered.
If you can't contribute economically, please spread the word so more people can reach the service and media feature and support us. Involve your community and follow us on your social networks.
Risks and Challenges
There are similar developments going on, their business model is charge for the product to health systems and payer groups, with a lot of venture money on the table. We want to finance ourselves with this campaign, sponsorships and maybe ads. We don't have investors and we don't want millionaire returns for us, so we require a lot less financing, reached with your help.
They prioritize the design and ios deployment. We prioritize the accessibility from ANY device, with ANY internet connection, our service is worldwide from day one.

En tiempo record, con dedicación exclusiva, trabajo duro y largas horas la primera versión del servicio está online. Financiada de mi propio bolsillo. No es humo, es un producto real totalmente usable por diabéticos y por clínicas para gestión remota, totalmente gratuito. Traducido ya a español e inglés.


24/06/2015-12/31/2015
Agotados mis propios recursos, comienzo la campaña de crowdfunding. La comunidad diabética puede instalar de google play y probar el sistema y correr la voz, doctores individuales, clínicas y sistemas de salud pueden empezar a usarla para cuidado remoto de sus pacientes y contribuir económicamente al éxito de esta campaña.VER OBJETIVOS ABAJO: Securizar y redimensionar servidores, contratar un equipo para acabar desarrollo y dar soporte multilingüe.


01/01/2016-
El proyecto continua, autofinanciándose de publicidad y patrocinadores.



Mi nombre es Rogelio Triviño. Soy matemático y desarrollador de software independiente desde hace más de 23 años. Hace unos meses, mi hija Clara tuvo su debut diabético (tipo 1). Hoy lanzamos la primera versión de la app móvil y web y el servicio web asociado.
Operamos bajo la estricta ley de protección de datos española y las leyes de la Unión Europea. Nuestros servidores de aplicación se encuentran en Suecia principalmente por privacidad de datos. Somos expertos en seguridad en internet y la seguridad y privacidad de nuestros servidores es un punto clave de nuestra propuesta. Usaremos nuestros recursos financieros para cumplir con la HIPAA americada lo antes posible.
Los datos médicos son siempre privados, los usuarios los comparten desde su configuración con sus médicos y familiares. Usamos datos médicos para predecir las curvas de glucosa de otros usuarios, pero siempre de forma totalmente anónima. 

OBJETIVOS: 
Hemos elegido financiación flexible para continuar con el proyecto usando los recursos disponibles en el siguiente orden de prioridad:
1) Securizar servidores y dimensionarlos a la base de usuarios.
2) Publicar la  app en Apple App Store y otros markets.
3) Mejorar los gráficos para un mejor cuidado por parte de usuarios y doctores.
4) Entrada automática de datos desde glucómetros, sistemas de medición continua y bombas de insulina (como diasend).
5) Concluir desarrollo con alertas, mensajes y red social para intercambio de apoyo, cuidado remoto, intercambio de recetas, etc.6) Usar datos médicos anónimamente para crear sistema de predicción de niveles de glucosa.7) Crear un buen sistema de soporte, tutoriales, redes sociales, etc.
8) Cumplimentar requisitos para protección de datos (HIPPA compliant) y certificación de producto sanitario (FDA y UE), y todos los requisitos legales.
9) Traducir a otros idiomas.
10) Mejorar la velocidad del cliente.
11) Crear un juego del ciclo de la digestión para que los niños entiendan el equilibrio insulina-glucosa.
Para alcanzar estos
objetivos necesitamos 90.000 USD en este primer esfuerzo de
financiación. Luego queremos mantener el servicio online con
patrocinios y publicidad. Por favor difunda la campaña para que los
diabéticos puedan usar el servicio y contribuir a la financiación.
Estaremos atentos al idioma de nuestros donantes. Con 1000 USD en un determinado lenguaje, este deviene prioridad 1 de traducción, con 5000 USD, prioridad 1 de soporte.
Por favor contacte
con los desarrolladores en nuestro sitio google+ o pregúntenos
en twitter. Atendemos inglés y español por el momento.

    Riesgos y desafíos

Hay proyectos parecidos en marcha, cuyo modelo de negocio es cobrar a los sistemas de salud y aseguradoras, con mucho capital riesgo involucrado. Nosotros nos proponemos financiarnos solo con donativos, patrocinios y publicidad si fuera necesario. No tenemos inversores ni pretendemos beneficios millonarios para nosotros, así que requerimos mucha menos financiación, que alcanzaremos con vuestra ayuda.Ellos priman el diseño y su despliegue en ios. Nosotros primamos la accesibilidad desde cualquier dispositivo, con cualquier conexión a intenet, nuestro ámbito de servicio es mundial desde el primer día.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>These also had flaws in them
including: children experiencing irritated skin after use, the length of one
was too short resulting in the child's wrist bending (floppy wrist syndrome),

just too expensive.</p>

<p>The research started in September 2011
and with the help of a squash playing colleague and engineer Paul Brameld he
started researching and planning the design of what he hoped to be a fool
proof, professional and affordable paddle, The EzeeBat.</p>
<p>The British Department Trade &amp;
Industry offered Peter great support in approving some initial funding (£1500)
to help cover some of the CAD drawing costs. They have also suggested that when
the time comes to want to export this product, they could assist by providing
use of British Embassy offices around the world as meeting points for potential
buyers.</p>
<p>Fiona's uncle Rob Clark in Australia
was visiting us in the UK round about this time and he as engineer has CAD
Drawing facilities at his work in Melbourne, he very kindly drafted the first
CAD drawing and prototype of what Peter was looking for.</p>
<p>We then took his work and asked a
company in Leicestershire - 3Di (Michael Lannie) - to officially draw up the CAD Drawings for the EzeeBat.</p>
<p>Peter then put out to tender with 4
companies the manufacture and tooling for the bat as well as for the plastic molding
of the outer surfaces of the EzeeBat.</p>
<p>Fortunately I  found a  company also in Leicestershire (one of the few owned by a lady) Michelle Cooper
from JSB Plastics.</p>
<p>They also do molding for The Body
Shop and some of the major supermarkets. She has AJ Tooling literally 50 yards
from her company and they do all the tooling for her. Not only was her
quotation competitive but because of her experience working with The Body Shop
she has also offered to do bar coding, assembly and packaging of the EzeeBat.</p>

Dupa ce a suferit un accident, fiind împușcat în burtă, concubina la părăsit. A fost tratat la spitalul din Nisporeni, dar este nevoie de o operație mai complexă la Chișinău. Noi l-am găsit într-o stare critică, fiind uneori hrănit de o bătrânică vecină. Cu ajutorul autorităților locale a fost internat de urgență unde a primit îngrijire medicală. Este nevoie de o operație pentru a fi înlocuită o parte de os cu o bucată de metal, fiindcă bucata de os e percepută de organism ca corp străin și nu e alimentată corespunzător. La fel intestinul gros a fost secționat grav și nu poate fi refăcut. Print-o fisură creată se va rezolva problema cu eliminarea maselor fecale.Suma preliminară pentru intervenția chirurgicală este de 2000-3000 dolari. În următoarele zile vom afla de la medic mai exact. Cu eforturile proprii au fost adunați în jur de 150 dolari pentru spitalizarea lui Dumitru. Puteți dona prin intermediul acestei campanii orice suma dorită cu achitarea prin PayPal sau prin card bancar.Puteți transmite sume de bani contactând telefonic pe Alex (+37369308663) sau Adrian.Pentru orice altă solicatare: helpdumitru@gmail.comSă salvăm o viață!Crăciun fericit!OF & FnV",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Pam's Journey<br/>
</h3>Pam Jojnowicz is a 20 -year old young woman from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She's incredibly caring, smart and loves making her friends laugh. Her lifelong dream is to help as many people as she can. <br/><br/>Four years ago, Pam began having difficulty walking and started having intense migraines. Eventually, her legs gave out and she was unable to walk for more than a few feet. Her poor health forced her to drop out of university. After being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2010, Pam's family and friends raised money for the Liberation Treatment for MS in Katowice, Poland. When she got to Poland, she and her family were heartbroken to find out she wasn't eligible for the Liberation Treatment. </span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Soon, her health deteriorated even further - intense head pressure, neuropathic pain, stomach pain, insomnia and even loss of vision in her right eye are just some of the symptoms - and she still could barely walk. As time went on, her family did more research into MS and began questioning whether or not MS was the correct diagnosis.  Pam started to wonder if she had Lyme Disease.</span></span></span></p>
<p>-Lyme Disease is caused by a bacterial infection that people can get from the bite of an infected blacklegged (deer) tick. Southern Manitoba has the highest population of blacklegged ticks in the world. It's VERY common for it to go undiagnosed or  be misdiagnosed as MS. For people like Pam, this means going through endless treatments, spending thousands of dollars and suffering day and night as the disease progresses.- (<a href=""http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/lyme/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/lyme/)</a><br/></p>
<div>
<br/><p></p>
<p>For a long time, every doctor Pam went to in Winnipeg refused to test her for Lyme Disease. MS and Lyme Disease have very similar symptoms; it's crucial to properly diagnose early on. They insisted she had MS, going so far as prescribing her steroids, twice. This forced Pam to start looking for answers and a cure abroad. <br/></p>

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/>In Spring 2013, Pam went to the Living Foods Institute in Atlanta with her mom in search of answers. There she met a woman with almost identical symptoms - and she had Lyme Disease. This further confirmed Pam's suspicions about her diagnosis. When she was tested in Canada for Lyme Disease, her tests came back both positive and negative. These results were extremely discouraging and confusing.  Pam and her family were forced to look for answers abroad once again. In the Summer of 2013, Pam went to the a Lyme Disease specialist, Dr Piotr Kurkiewicz, in Warsaw Poland. The specialist tested her twice, just to be sure.</span></span></span><p></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Both tests came back positive.

<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Testing for Lyme disease in Manitoba is completely unreliable. This doesn't make sense because it's a common disease that's deadly when it goes untreated. Overseas, Lyme Disease is less common and treated with great urgency, unlike here in Canada.
