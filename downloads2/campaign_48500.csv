At Triposo we make apps that let you travel like a local. Travel guides with smart suggestions, local events and offline maps help you feel free to roam the streets and explore. But you won't really look like a local if you have to consult your phone the whole time, so we're making a belt that will guide you to your destination by buzzing you around.








You open the Triposo app and pick where you want to go.
Tap the buzz me there option in the app. 
The app knows where you are, where you are heading and as soon as you start moving it will send signals to the belt telling you what direction to take.  This will make one of the four vibration motors in the belt buzz left, right, straight or back. 
The belt comes with a cable to connect the phone to the belt.
It uses the headphone jack so it will work with any device that can run our app (iOS and Android). 

Other apps can use the belt too - the protocol to send it signals is as simple as can be. 







It may not be as sophisticated as a turn-by-turn route planner and it might just send you down a couple of streets you had not planned on seeing, but that's part of wandering. And you won't feel like a tourist - no need to get the phone out of your pocket the whole time.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The WOOLRIOR Story</h2>
<p><strong>Hi, this is us, and yes, of course we are all wearing  Woolrior socks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We live on two continents, separated by an ocean and we work in businesses that are very competitive and difficult, especially having in mind  China produced low quality and low price garments. And on both continents, we suffer the consequences of increasing waste disposal, most of it coming from fast fashion.We decided to join forces and try to develop socks that are eco friendly, socks that are durable, that are made mostly of natural yarn. But not in the cost of NASA project. Socks might be just socks to most people, but the quest to find the longest lasting socks known  has been our driving force for the last few years. After all, why shouldn’t socks last a lifetime? We demanded sock perfection and spent years testing current brands on the market and testing different type of merino wools. At the end we realized that compromising quality isn’t worth it! That's why the wool we chose for our Woolriors is the best on the market - it undergoes ""Naturetex plasma treatment"" - an award - winning technology which is certified for organic use and ecofriendly because of the applied chlorine free process. The merino wool we use is durable, but gentle to the skin, it is naturally antimicrobial and will keep your feet odorless and dry.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Well, This Is How We Want To Help You Reduce the amount of garments becoming waste. When your Woolrior socks are worn out, we ask you to send them back to us for a brand new pair. Once we have a large enough stock of old socks, we will send them to our recycling partner, to give those used garments a new purpose, and not have them end up at a landfill.<br/> Plus, Woolrior socks are very durable!</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Reducing our clothing impact is one of the many things we can do!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Fast fashion, with it’s rapid production cycles of low quality garments,<br/>contributes to excessive consumption and wastefulness with<br/>worrying impact on Earth.<br/>Worldwide, the fashion industry is the Second dirtiest right after the Oil Industry.</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> ""HAND -LINKED"" TOE PROCESS</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <strong>The toe part of an ordinary sock is usually finished /sewn/ by a sewing machine,which normally makes the toe part thicker and inconvenient. Hand-linking is a demanding technique where each single thread on the toe and the sock foot are linked manually. It makes the toe seam totally flat and comfortable.Usually, this work is done by professional workers. The paradox about the manual hand-linking technique is that it can be harmful for the professional worker’s eyes. For WOOLRIOR we use last generation, Italian knitting machines that provide an extraordinary quality of the linking.</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who'll Wear Woolrior?<strong>​</strong>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">How many times have you reluctantly thrown a favorite pair of socks away because they’ve worn out?<br/>Well, guess what? Woolrior socks will become your new favorite<br/>socks and you’ll never have to throw them out. Ever.<br/>If you get Woolrior socks for Christmas, you’ll be able to cross socks off your<br/>Christmas wish list forever, because you won’t need anymore socks<br/>– unless you want Santa to bring you more pairs of Woolriors!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Woolrior Socks Are The Most Durable Socks You'll Ever Pull On Your Feet</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are only limited by the most advanced materials and technologies.<br/>We bet there are no socks, as fine as ours, in your drawers back home<br/>that come with a lifetime warranty. No socks, made of the highest quality merino,<br/>that will last and last and last, no matter what you put them through.<br/>Isn’t it about time you demanded more durability from your socks?<br/>It’s no longer acceptable for them to wear thin or spring holes after a few wears.<br/>Not when Woolrior socks offer a great alternative with a lifetime guarantee.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<div>                                                        <div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/RR1giAPbYqc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A great pair of socks should be as durable as they are comfortable.<br/>We’ve used the Martindale Abrasion Test to compare our product to the<br/>average sock. The average sock breaks at <strong>3,500 cycles</strong>,<br/>while Woolrior withstands <strong>12,500 cycles</strong> with no sign of damage.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why We Need Your Backing</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We’ve spent years researching and developing Woolrior socks,<br/>to such an extent that we are confident enough in their staying power<br/>to offer a lifetime warranty with every pair. That’s going<br/>to give us something strong to hang our marketing hats on.<br/>And that’s where you come in. Because we need funding to make our<br/>marketing campaigns happen, and to help us move into mass production of our high spec,<br/>long lasting socks. Help us bring socks with warranties to a world that’s ready<br/>for socks that last the distance and won’t get thrown into the trash can like<br/>regular socks.Woolrior socks will be priced to be affordable for everyone.<br/>And remember, they are long-lasting, so you will save on having to buy socks in the future.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why You Should Back Us</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Unless you’re planning to spend the rest of your life living on a beach<br/>wearing flip flops, you’re going to need socks. And why waste money<br/>on socks that won’t last, when you can buy socks that are guaranteed<br/>to last you a lifetime? Socks are the most underrated item of clothing<br/>we wear every day. We take them for granted, but we really notice the<br/>difference when they’re not there. <strong>Woolrior</strong> socks will always be there.<br/>Let us do the legwork for you, and deliver the best socks you can currently buy!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Can't Contribute Right Now?<br/>No Problem...</h3>
<p>We get it that not everyone has the spare cash to support our campaign. But you can still help us out by spreading the word about our campaign across social media. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our official campaign hashtag is #SocksForLife which sums up the lasting power of Woolrior, and it also refers to the fact that we will donate $1 of every pair of socks we sell to support / diabetes or/ children leukemia research. </p>

Well, This Is How We Want To Help You Reduce the amount of garments becoming waste. When your Woolrior socks are worn out, we ask you to send them back to us for a brand new pair. Once we have a large enough stock of old socks, we will send them to our recycling partner, to give those used garments a new purpose, and not have them end up at a landfill. Plus, Woolrior socks are very durable!
 

Reducing our clothing impact is one of the many things we can do!
Fast fashion, with it’s rapid production cycles of low quality garments,contributes to excessive consumption and wastefulness withworrying impact on Earth.Worldwide, the fashion industry is the Second dirtiest right after the Oil Industry.

The world is looking for lasting everything right now. We’re all aware of thedetrimental impact the way we live is having on the environment.We watch what we throw away more carefully than ever,and we’re all recycling as much as we can.Woolrior socks as the name suggests, are hardwearing,super comfortable footwear that’s designed to last a lifetime.We’re so confident that they’ll handle wherever your feet take them,each and every pair comes with a lifetime warranty

Chlorine-Free wool​​

 
 ""HAND -LINKED"" TOE PROCESS
 The toe part of an ordinary sock is usually finished /sewn/ by a sewing machine,which normally makes the toe part thicker and inconvenient. Hand-linking is a demanding technique where each single thread on the toe and the sock foot are linked manually. It makes the toe seam totally flat and comfortable.Usually, this work is done by professional workers. The paradox about the manual hand-linking technique is that it can be harmful for the professional worker’s eyes. For WOOLRIOR we use last generation, Italian knitting machines that provide an extraordinary quality of the linking.
                                                     

 
Who'll Wear Woolrior?​

How many times have you reluctantly thrown a favorite pair of socks away because they’ve worn out?Well, guess what? Woolrior socks will become your new favoritesocks and you’ll never have to throw them out. Ever.If you get Woolrior socks for Christmas, you’ll be able to cross socks off yourChristmas wish list forever, because you won’t need anymore socks– unless you want Santa to bring you more pairs of Woolriors!
 
 
Why Woolrior Socks Are The Most Durable Socks You'll Ever Pull On Your Feet
We are only limited by the most advanced materials and technologies.We bet there are no socks, as fine as ours, in your drawers back homethat come with a lifetime warranty. No socks, made of the highest quality merino,that will last and last and last, no matter what you put them through.Isn’t it about time you demanded more durability from your socks?It’s no longer acceptable for them to wear thin or spring holes after a few wears.Not when Woolrior socks offer a great alternative with a lifetime guarantee.
 
                                                        

 
A great pair of socks should be as durable as they are comfortable.We’ve used the Martindale Abrasion Test to compare our product to theaverage sock. The average sock breaks at 3,500 cycles,while Woolrior withstands 12,500 cycles with no sign of damage.
​
Premium wear, easy care
Woolrior combines everything you want in a premium wool sock with the easy care everyone with a busy life needs.​


 
Why We Need Your Backing

Risks and challenges
As we all know Our Border And Customs Agencies conduct routine inspections on random shipments entering the Country, and thank God for those. In the unlikely but possible event of that happening to our shipments, please keep in mind that it may take up to 3 weeks for the goods to be processed and released to us for final dispatch to you!
Wa have established great relationships with our suppliers and there are no concerns about demands or production delays, as we are currently able to produce 35,000 pairs per month.",17.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>This campaign is to help my family's costuming business expand our services.  We have been in business for over thirty years, vending at Science Fiction conventions and Medieval/Renaissance festivals.  It started out as a hobby, but over the past few years we've been working hard to make this our full time business.  <br/></p>
<p>We offer some embroidery services, and custom embroidery digitizing already, but our equipment just cannot keep up with our ideas and the demand that we have.  We have a lot of great ideas to expand our clothing line, including more high-end garments with tons of embellishments, and for that we need a better embroidery machine.<br/></p>
<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>What we need is one or two multi-thread industrial embroidery machines that can handle being run for long periods of time every day.  That can stitch faster, with better quality, without having to be continually supervised by a human.  (Do you have any idea the frustration that develops when one has to constantly put down the project in hand just to deal with a cranky machine that is supposed to run itself?)  We need a machine that will allow us to create larger and more complicated finished pieces in a single session.  We are going to use this campaign to offer preorders of custom embroidered merchandise made with the new machine.<br/></p>
<p>After a lot of research, we have narrowed down our choices to two models</p></span><ul>
<li>the Brother Entrepreneur PR655 (6 needles)</li>
<li>the Brother Entrepreneur Pro PR1000e (10 needles)</li>

<br/><p><b>Our fundraising goals:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal 1: $14,000 (One 6 needle machine)</li>
<li>Goal 2: $18,000 (One 10 needle machine)<br/>
</li>
<li>Goal 3: $29,000 (Two 6 needle machines)</li>
<li>Goal 4: $37,000 (Two 10 needle machines)</li>
</ul>
<span class=""notranlsate""><p>These fundraising goals cover the price of the machine(s), materials fees and shipping for perks, Indiegogo's fees, and all applicable taxes.  Any money beyond our goal will be used to purchase supplies and accessories for embroidery.  (Extra embroidery hoops, stabilizer, thread, fabric, software upgrades, etc.)<br/></p>
<h3>Our Perks</h3>
<p>We have many different donation perks available that will be made for you when we hit our funding goal and are able to purchase the embroidery machine.  Bags, patches, masks, custom costumes, even teddy bears!  Get something special made for your friends and family for this holiday season, or just treat yourself.  For whatever perk you choose, with the exception of the mystery swatch, you get to select the colors of the fabric, the embroidered decoration, and the color of the embroidery design.  Pick an embroidery design from our catalog (photos after the perk descriptions) or a monogram.  All of the donation perks at $50 and over come with the option of us creating a custom embroidery design based off of your own artwork!  Shipping fees inside the US are included in the perk prices.  (If you live outside of the United States and want one of our perks, please contact us before you contribute for a shipping estimate.)<br/></p>

<p>We rescue orphaned teddy bears.  Loveable as they are, we can't keep them all!  Surely you can help provide a home for one, two, or even ten.  Everyone needs a cuddly companion.  Bears are good company for your children, they can watch your office desk while you are out to lunch.  For a $30 adoption fee, we will send you a 12"" teddy bear with a tunic.  (We can't have bare bears running around!)  Pick an embroidery design from our catalog or a custom monogram, and the colors of your choice, and when this campaign is a success you will provide a home for a sweet bear.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of our happy customers wearing matching men's surcoats that we made for them with their house symbol embroidered on the left breast.  The sleeveless surcoat is suitable for wearing over your regular garb, and sturdy enough to be worn over armor while in combat (depending on the fabric of course!)  <br/></p>
<p>We offer surcoats either party-colored (two-tone, as above) or solid colored (One fabric color).  For the embroidery, you can either choose one of our stock designs, or send us a graphic and we will make a custom design.  The fabrics you may pick from are regular cotton, heavy cotton twill, or trigger (a poly-cotton blend.)  <br/></p>
<p>This is a one-size-fits-most garment, after all there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all!  As you can see in the photo above, when worn with a belt our men's surcoat looks fantastic on many body types.  We will contact you after the campaign has succeeded to get your preferences on fabric, colors, and the embroidery design.</p>

<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>We have been building our following by vending at more and more shows over the past couple of years.  The Maryland Faerie Festival, the Medieval Festival at Ft. Tyron Park, Estrella War, Gulf Wars, ShadowCon, are some of the events we have attended.  We have been merchanting at the Pennsic War for well over twenty years. <br/><br/>An industrial embroidery machine will not only allow us to make custom embellished garments in a practical time frame, it will make stockpiling smaller items such as bags, teddy bears, and bibs far easier.  We will be able to reach out to retail stores with the ability to wholesale.  Our accessories line will expand, as we will be able to add embroidered lace items, custom embroidered corsets, and prototype other ideas more quickly.  We are a small shop, and a reliable embroidery machine will free up our stitchers' time to work on the mainstay of our business, quality costumes.  With the ability to make more and better merchandise in the same amount of time, we will be able to attend larger shows and be more successful.

This campaign is to help my family's costuming business expand our services.  We have been in business for over thirty years, vending at Science Fiction conventions and Medieval/Renaissance festivals.  It started out as a hobby, but over the past few years we've been working hard to make this our full time business.  
We offer some embroidery services, and custom embroidery digitizing already, but our equipment just cannot keep up with our ideas and the demand that we have.  We have a lot of great ideas to expand our clothing line, including more high-end garments with tons of embellishments, and for that we need a better embroidery machine.
What We Need

What we need is one or two multi-thread industrial embroidery machines that can handle being run for long periods of time every day.  That can stitch faster, with better quality, without having to be continually supervised by a human.  (Do you have any idea the frustration that develops when one has to constantly put down the project in hand just to deal with a cranky machine that is supposed to run itself?)  We need a machine that will allow us to create larger and more complicated finished pieces in a single session.  We are going to use this campaign to offer preorders of custom embroidered merchandise made with the new machine.
After a lot of research, we have narrowed down our choices to two models
the Brother Entrepreneur PR655 (6 needles)
the Brother Entrepreneur Pro PR1000e (10 needles)


Our fundraising goals:

Goal 1: $14,000 (One 6 needle machine)
Goal 2: $18,000 (One 10 needle machine)

Goal 3: $29,000 (Two 6 needle machines)
Goal 4: $37,000 (Two 10 needle machines)

These fundraising goals cover the price of the machine(s), materials fees and shipping for perks, Indiegogo's fees, and all applicable taxes.  Any money beyond our goal will be used to purchase supplies and accessories for embroidery.  (Extra embroidery hoops, stabilizer, thread, fabric, software upgrades, etc.)
Our Perks
We have many different donation perks available that will be made for you when we hit our funding goal and are able to purchase the embroidery machine.  Bags, patches, masks, custom costumes, even teddy bears!  Get something special made for your friends and family for this holiday season, or just treat yourself.  For whatever perk you choose, with the exception of the mystery swatch, you get to select the colors of the fabric, the embroidered decoration, and the color of the embroidery design.  Pick an embroidery design from our catalog (photos after the perk descriptions) or a monogram.  All of the donation perks at $50 and over come with the option of us creating a custom embroidery design based off of your own artwork!  Shipping fees inside the US are included in the perk prices.  (If you live outside of the United States and want one of our perks, please contact us before you contribute for a shipping estimate.)
$10 - Mystery Swatch
When making new embroidery designs, we have to make a test stitch-out first to check for quality before use on our merchandise.  This results in a LOT of random pieces of embroidery floating around the shop, many of which are on scraps or oddly-shaped pieces of fabric that are too small to be used with our regular garment patterns.  For a $10 donation, we'll send you one of them.  Which design?  What colors?  No peeking, its a surprise!
$15 - Mask
(Above, Fleur dis Lis Mask in various color combinations)
For $15, we will send you one of our embroidered fabric masks.  These are made from cotton, are very comfortable, and as a bonus are machine washable!  Pick from either our fleur dis lis mask, or the vine mask in the colors of your choice.
(Below, the Vine Mask in various color combinations)

$15 - Mini-Pennant / Belt Favor

(Above, Favors on a performer's basket for decoration and as a subtle way to inform that credit cards are accepted.)Decorate with a small flag embroidered with a design of your choice.  Hang it on the wall, display it on your boat, use your imagination!  Medieval reenactors often like to show household affiliations or personal affections by hanging one of these favors on their belts.  Choose the colors of your choice and a design from our catalog or a custom monogram.
$25 - Drawstring Pouch


Everyone needs something to hold small valuables.  For $25, we will send you a lined drawstring pouch.  This pouch is large enough to hold a deck of cards, your wallet and phone, a large number of dice, or whatever other small treasures you can think of.  You get to pick an embroidered design from our catalog or a custom monogram, with embroidery and fabric in the color your choosing.
$30 - Teddy Bear

We rescue orphaned teddy bears.  Loveable as they are, we can't keep them all!  Surely you can help provide a home for one, two, or even ten.  Everyone needs a cuddly companion.  Bears are good company for your children, they can watch your office desk while you are out to lunch.  For a $30 adoption fee, we will send you a 12"" teddy bear with a tunic.  (We can't have bare bears running around!)  Pick an embroidery design from our catalog or a custom monogram, and the colors of your choice, and when this campaign is a success you will provide a home for a sweet bear.


$15 - Iron-on Patch
$50 - Iron-on Patches (set of 6)
(Above and below, Sample patches)
One of the requests that we've been getting constantly ever since we started embroidering our merchandise has been for patches.  Especially for this campaign we are going to make them!  For $15 we will make a 3"" diameter iron-on patch in your choice of colors and with a monogram or design from our catalog.  For $50, you will get a matching set of six patches, and you also have the option of sending us your artwork for a custom embroidery design.

$50 - Embroidered Shoulder Bag

(Above, a shoulder bag with a giant wolf)
Everyone needs something to carry their belongings in!  Why not one of our shoulder bags, in the colors and with a large embroidery design of your choice from our catalog?  As an alternative, we can embroider it with your name or a custom monogram instead.
$100 - Embroidered Men's Surcoat

(Above, a pair of members from House Selohaar in men's surcoats.)
Here are a couple of our happy customers wearing matching men's surcoats that we made for them with their house symbol embroidered on the left breast.  The sleeveless surcoat is suitable for wearing over your regular garb, and sturdy enough to be worn over armor while in combat (depending on the fabric of course!)  
We offer surcoats either party-colored (two-tone, as above) or solid colored (One fabric color).  For the embroidery, you can either choose one of our stock designs, or send us a graphic and we will make a custom design.  The fabrics you may pick from are regular cotton, heavy cotton twill, or trigger (a poly-cotton blend.)  
This is a one-size-fits-most garment, after all there is no such thing as one-size-fits-all!  As you can see in the photo above, when worn with a belt our men's surcoat looks fantastic on many body types.  We will contact you after the campaign has succeeded to get your preferences on fabric, colors, and the embroidery design.
(Below, a men's surcoat and a matching teddy bear we made for an EMT)
$500 Men's Houppelande
(Left, a black and green houppelande.  Right, a black and red houppelande in combat.)With full sleeves, decorated with square dags, our men's houppelande is a fancy Medieval overshirt fine enough to wear before the king (in fact they have been worn by Kings in the SCA), yet sturdy enough to wear over armor and take into combat.  Worn with a belt, this men’s garment emphasizes the shoulders, while allowing you to show off your legs for the ladies.  It can be worn alone, or over one of our collared tunics and a pair of hose.  Our most popular garment, we’ve sold hundreds of these over the years with many satisfied customers in the Society for Creative Anachronism, at medieval events, and Renaissance faires.  We are offering them at a special price just for our Indiegogo backers.  You can see more photos of houppelandes that we've made over the years on Hobbitronics' houppelande page.
Our dagged houppelande can be two-toned (as in the photos) or solid colored with a contrasting sleeve lining.  We can can make them in cotton, trigger, linen, wool, or silk.  Pick your colors, and we will decorate the dags (square tabs) on the sleeves with the design of your choice.
(Below, a custom black and white houppelande with ermines decorating the black dags.)

$800 - Custom Angel-Wing Dress

(Prototype custom-embroidered Angelwing Dress)
Our highest level perk, the custom Angelwing Dress.  For a special price just for our Indiegogo backers we will make this dress out of high-quality linen, wool, heavy cotton, or silk.  Normally a commissioned piece like this would run between $1,000 and $1,500.  It will be embroidered around the neck, sleeves, and hem with the motif(s) of your choice, we can even make embroidery designs with your custom artwork!  The prototype above uses five different embroidered designs from our catalog.  After the campaign is over we will contact you to get your size information and color preferences.
(Below, sleeve detail of the prototype.  Compass stars and Celtic knotwork crescent moons in metallic thread.)

The Impact
We have been building our following by vending at more and more shows over the past couple of years.  The Maryland Faerie Festival, the Medieval Festival at Ft. Tyron Park, Estrella War, Gulf Wars, ShadowCon, are some of the events we have attended.  We have been merchanting at the Pennsic War for well over twenty years. An industrial embroidery machine will not only allow us to make custom embellished garments in a practical time frame, it will make stockpiling smaller items such as bags, teddy bears, and bibs far easier.  We will be able to reach out to retail stores with the ability to wholesale.  Our accessories line will expand, as we will be able to add embroidered lace items, custom embroidered corsets, and prototype other ideas more quickly.  We are a small shop, and a reliable embroidery machine will free up our stitchers' time to work on the mainstay of our business, quality costumes.  With the ability to make more and better merchandise in the same amount of time, we will be able to attend larger shows and be more successful.

Little did we know that what started as just an alternative to winter hats would turn into an important part of recovery for women dealing with cancer.</p>
<p><strong>The Babushkah Backstory</strong></p>
<p>It all started when I told my mom I wanted a warm bandana that wouldn’t give me “hat head” like so many winter hats did. Surprisingly, we couldn’t find any bandanas made from anything but thin cotton, so she did what any mom who sews would:  She made me one.  It was perfect! It looked stylish and was really warm, with Polar Fleece on one side and pretty velvet on the other.</p>
<p>After getting compliments from strangers in the street and requests from friends to buy them, we decided to try our hand at a mom/daughter fashion accessories business. We poured our time (and savings!) into making what we started calling Babushkahs™ – a line of warm bandanas that were reversible and handmade, with beautiful fashion fabrics (denim, micro-suede, chenille, knits, etc.) backed with Polar Fleece.</p>
<p>It was at an accessories show in New York that we began getting requests from women dealing with hair loss as a result of chemotherapy. They loved our Babushkahs because they didn’t scream “cancer” like other turbans on the market and were more about fashion and style than just a way to hide hair loss.</p>
<p>The outpouring of requests from chemotherapy patients for a larger bandana was so overwhelming that we decided to make a Babushkah Headscarf to serve their needs even better: We added a lightweight version that was backed with wicking material to keep the scalp cool and dry. We chose fabrics that were not only stylish but were also soft and slip-proof. We fine-tuned the shape to make them even easier to tie and to provide full head-coverage if desired. But most of all, we made sure to use contemporary fabrics with a huge array of colors and patterns to flatter every face and personal style.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Non-profits wanted our Babushkahs for fundraisers. Hospitals wanted them for their boutiques. Patients called asking how they could get them.  It didn’t take long for us to realize that we could help even more women if we started an online store, where women could buy them from the privacy of their own homes. So we did at <a href=""http://www.headscarves.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.headscarves.com</a>.</p>
<p>Quickly we became inundated with thank-you emails and calls from women of all ages dealing with hair loss, from teens to mature women. Here is a sampling of some of the comments we’ve received:</p>
<ul>
<li>""This is my fourth Babushkah. They've given me an absolute new lease on life."" – Diane, age 44</li>
<li>“I’m 16 and don’t like to wear baseball caps to cover up the hair I’ve lost. But I love my Babushkah! It’s really cool and suits me.” – Stephanie, age 16</li>
<li>“My Babushkahs make me feel I’m still attractive even though I’ve lost so much hair.” – Laura, age 52</li>
<li>“Babushkahs remind me that I can fight this thing and do it with style. Thanks.” – Pat, age 39</li>
<li>“I was almost more afraid of losing my hair than the effects of chemo. But as soon as I put on my first Babushkah, I realized I could handle the hair loss without having to hide out in my house.” – Arlene, age 61</li>
<li>“I know I wear my Babushkah to cover hair loss. But everyone else thinks I’ve just got great taste and gorgeous accessories! Makes me smile.” – Kathy, age 49</li>
<li>“Thank you for my Babushkah. Can you believe that I’m actually excited to put it on in the morning? The chemo-turbans I used to wear made me feel like I belonged on Little House on the Prairie!” - Jill, age 47</li>
</ul><p>Frankly, we had no idea that our little Babushkah would make such a difference! But since then, we’ve learned why. Losing one’s hair during treatment can be so traumatic that it can impede the recovery process.</p>
<p>“For some patients, the fear of treatment-induced alopecia is so significant that some women may refuse potentially curative chemotherapy.” (Tierney and Taylor 1991, Pruzinsky 2004).</p>
<p>In a study about hair loss and the treatment process, one woman said, “[Hair loss] hit me with a bang. I am not too sure if losing the breast affected me as badly. I actually couldn’t get over [my hair loss.] Your confidence is taken away from you without your hair.” (Cancer Nursing Practice, Sept 1998)</p>
<p>Needless to say, doing everything possible to make a patient look better can be critical to recovery. And clearly our Babushkahs help.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem -- and Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Babushkahs has been a passion of ours – albeit not a profitable one. My mom and I have funded these efforts ourselves -- and we’ve only managed to squeak by. With little money for marketing, we have been forturnate that patients find us through Google, word of mouth and from the support groups and hospitals we partner with. But still, we reach only a fraction of the women we wish we could and consistently hear surprise at the existence of Babushkahs. In fact, many cancer survivors have said to us, ""Where were you when I needed you?""</p>
<p>We can't bear to hear that anymore. Every single woman dealing with the side effects of chemo should know we're here. There just is no reason for any woman to look less than beautiful while she's battling something so traumatic.</p>
<p>So it's time to go big or go home. We can't afford to stay in business or grow it if we continue funding it ourselves. That’s where you come in. Your pledge will go towards:</p>
<p>-  relaunching our web store, with a new design and new photography</p>
<p>- increased marketing efforts</p>
<p>- improved production costs</p>
<p>- a new line</p>
<p>Plus, for every pledge received, we will donate headscarves to CancerCare, a premier national support organization (<a href=""http://www.cancercare.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cancercare.org</a>). Exceeding our goal means more headscarves for more women in need.</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for your support. Together we can make someone look -- and feel -- a bit better during and after treatment.</p></div>","For the past 10 years, my mom and I have been making and selling Babushkah™ headscarves.

<div>We are passionate about our designs and only print using high quality techniques and the best quality products.  There's nothing worse than buying a T-Shirt you love and only being able to wear it a handful of times before the design begins to diminish or it starts to lose its shape.  Let's face it, we've all encountered the dreaded T-Shirt tail; where the garment loses its shape and flies away at the base of the back.  Don't you just hate that?!  We certainly do.  After all it's a T-Shirt not a T-Skirt!</div>
<div>With Influx Clothing there's no chance of that.  After intensive research and product testing we have found what we believe to be the highest quality dye sublimation garments money can buy.  Combined with the quailty of a dye sublimation print these T-shirts are certainly made to last.</div>

<p>I’ve always wanted to work for myself and have always been a creative, so it was the perfect venture for me at the time. </p>
<p>At the same time I was getting tired and restless with what I was making – I wanted to escape from the wedding industry and instead start doing what I’ve always wanted to do; Design luxury handbags for women that <b><i>WORK</i></b>. My desire to achieve more led me to the London College of Fashion and to a course in Handbag design.</p>

<p>I was thrilled and I was terrified. I knew I wanted to make a change, but how would I take on the world of handbags? It was such a huge leap for me!</p>
<p>Then one weekend in February 2014 I attended a weekend course called ‘Unlocking the Will to Act’ and I spoke to the trainer’s daughter. She asked me what my plans were for the future.

<h3>'Aioga' is not just a brand name... it's a statement. </h3>Inherent in that word, ""Aioga"" (pronounced ""I yoga"") is the <b>declaration</b> that ""I practice yoga. I'm fully 
invested in myself and in being the best version of me that I can 
possibly be."" <br/><br/>'Aioga' is a call to action - a lifestyle - a state of
 being. It's a recognition that Life is a journey - that we never stop 
learning and we never stop growing - and ""I'm on-board for the whole 
ride.""<br/><br/><h3>No longer does Yoga fit into any particular box. <br/>
</h3>
<p>For years, there has seemed to be a particular ""type of person"" who practiced yoga - and as such, there has been a <b>decidedly narrow perception and aesthetic of the industry</b>.</p>But those days are behind us. <br/><br/>Today, <b>people of every size, shape, and color are finding their way into the practice of yoga</b>. Not only does practically everyone have a friend, sibling, or partner who <i>swears</i> by it, but we're also seeing doctors prescribe yoga for all manner of physical, psychological, and emotional ailments, and moreover, a growing number of the world's most elite athletes and organizations are integrating yoga and meditation into their workout regiments.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432410780/sbx2asxiedrvmxgl4rkc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>Yoga is SO MUCH MORE than just stretching and contorting our bodies to make shapes in space. </h3>In fact, the physical practice we do in the studio is really just ONE of EIGHT components that, together, make up the traditional system of yoga. The other SEVEN limbs dig into ideas about <b>self-exploration, self-discovery</b>, how to <b>create better relationships with ourselves, our friends, family, communities, and beyond</b>, and that's just to name a few. Yoga helps us to simply <b>LIVE BETTER</b>... to find and maintain balance in mind, body, and soul.<br/><br/><h4>Instead of using concepts of 
self-empowerment and development as slogans and gimmicks to sell 
products, at Aioga, <b>these are at the very</b> <b>foundation</b> of <b>what we do </b>and<b> what we believe. </b><br/>
</h4>
<p>These
 ARE our products, and our apparel is simply a mechanism by which we 
invite our customers to embody these concepts and ideas of better living. <br/></p>

<br/>
<h4>This leads us to the two pillars of the Aioga mission:</h4>
<ol>
<li>We are dedicated to creating an endless stream of <b>beautiful, 
engaging, and information-rich content</b> to help people better understand 
themselves, their struggles and their strengths - as well as providing the <b>cutting-edge, interactive online tools</b> to support them in integrating these concepts and 
ideas into their everyday lives, so they can find a more complete sense 
of health and well-being on a day-to-day basis. <br/><br/>In addition to yoga videos, we're interviewing doctors and scientists to explain <b>how and why these tools serve us physiologically, biologically, and beyond</b>. <br/><br/>If you sit in a chair for 8 hours a day, we want you to understand what effect this has on your body, both in the short and the long term, as well as what you can do to counterbalance the negative effects.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432067339/khgdg92l9khmgd5rdfwm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>If you're an athlete, we want you to understand how yoga will take you to the next level, no matter what sport you play. There's a reason the world's most elite athletes and organizations are integrating yoga and mindfulness into their mandatory regiments. We'll break it down for you.<br/><br/>If you twist an ankle or break a bone, we want you to have a better sense as to how this is not an isolated event, but that the detrimental effects reverberate throughout your entire body... and we'll share <b>tips and tools for how you can reclaim balance and autonomy in your body</b> during and after recovery.<br/><br/>We're digging deep into <b>nutrition and wellness</b> in an effort to help you stay better informed about how you feed and sustain yourself, as well as sharing recipes and meal plans to make it easier to plan and create healthy meals for you and your family. <br/><br/>We'll be constructing an <b>online platform for you to connect with the studios, instructors, and yoga community</b> in your neighborhood and beyond.<br/><br/>And this is just the beginning of an endless supply of ideas, interviews, tools, and information we're creating to make your life easier, happier, and more complete.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FM_HdTzIlq1I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DM_HdTzIlq1I&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FM_HdTzIlq1I%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>

Why Aioga (""Why I Yoga"")


Improved brain function

Better sleep
Improved eating habits
Decreased stress & anxiety
Increased focus & concentration
Improved heart function
Increased libido and sexual function

Better posture
Increased bone density
Decreased susceptibility to depression
Improved lung capacity
Relief from chronic neck and back pain

Increased strength & flexibility 


The list of indisputable, scientifically proven benefits of yoga practice is long and continuously growing by the day. The evidence of yoga as a means to a happier, healthier life is beyond compelling.
Yet, despite this fact, the stereotypes and stigmas surrounding the practice continue to dissuade many from even giving it a shot.
This tragic dichotomy was the impetus for Aioga - and this essentially defined our mission: To demystify yoga... to help people understand that they don't have to change anything about themselves or leave anything behind in order to take up the practice. Come as you are. 
Every path and every practice is unique.


What we want to communicate most of all is that, with Aioga in your 
corner, you don't have to give up any part of yourself or to change a 
thing in order to bring all the incredible benefits of yoga 
practice into your life. Come as you are.We live in a moment in time when we, as a society, are beginning to understand that we have the capacity to LIVE BETTER
 than previous generations. With the Aioga tools and resources, you'll 
have the ability to find those ideas that resonate most with who you are
 and where you're heading, and you'll have the ability to integrate them
 into your life in whatever way serves you best. And, of course,
 we'll be providing the apparel you'll want with you every step of the 
way, no matter where your active lifestyle leads you.

WHAT YOU GET!

These logo print designs go a long way to communicate our style and identity, and with your contributions, we'll have the means necessary to take this Aioga aesthetic and translate it into our high quality, high-performance apparel.  
All of our t-shirts, tanks, and sweatshirts are printed on the uber-soft Bella + Canvas garments. Bella + Canvas received a WRAP Gold Rating , ensuring their impeccable dedication to the best business and production standards with regard to the environment, health and safety standards, human resources management, etc. For more information, see the WRAP details below the Aioga  perks section.
After the campaign closes, we will send you a link to a page where you'll choose which of the many color combos you'd prefer.







'Aioga' is not just a brand name... it's a statement. Inherent in that word, ""Aioga"" (pronounced ""I yoga"") is the declaration that ""I practice yoga. I'm fully 
invested in myself and in being the best version of me that I can 
possibly be."" 'Aioga' is a call to action - a lifestyle - a state of
 being. It's a recognition that Life is a journey - that we never stop 
learning and we never stop growing - and ""I'm on-board for the whole 
ride.""No longer does Yoga fit into any particular box. 

For years, there has seemed to be a particular ""type of person"" who practiced yoga - and as such, there has been a decidedly narrow perception and aesthetic of the industry.But those days are behind us. Today, people of every size, shape, and color are finding their way into the practice of yoga. Not only does practically everyone have a friend, sibling, or partner who swears by it, but we're also seeing doctors prescribe yoga for all manner of physical, psychological, and emotional ailments, and moreover, a growing number of the world's most elite athletes and organizations are integrating yoga and meditation into their workout regiments.


Yoga is SO MUCH MORE than just stretching and contorting our bodies to make shapes in space. In fact, the physical practice we do in the studio is really just ONE of EIGHT components that, together, make up the traditional system of yoga. The other SEVEN limbs dig into ideas about self-exploration, self-discovery, how to create better relationships with ourselves, our friends, family, communities, and beyond, and that's just to name a few. Yoga helps us to simply LIVE BETTER... to find and maintain balance in mind, body, and soul.Instead of using concepts of 
self-empowerment and development as slogans and gimmicks to sell 
products, at Aioga, these are at the very foundation of what we do and what we believe. 

These
 ARE our products, and our apparel is simply a mechanism by which we 
invite our customers to embody these concepts and ideas of better living. 




This leads us to the two pillars of the Aioga mission:

We are dedicated to creating an endless stream of beautiful, 
engaging, and information-rich content to help people better understand 
themselves, their struggles and their strengths - as well as providing the cutting-edge, interactive online tools to support them in integrating these concepts and 
ideas into their everyday lives, so they can find a more complete sense 
of health and well-being on a day-to-day basis. In addition to yoga videos, we're interviewing doctors and scientists to explain how and why these tools serve us physiologically, biologically, and beyond. If you sit in a chair for 8 hours a day, we want you to understand what effect this has on your body, both in the short and the long term, as well as what you can do to counterbalance the negative effects.
If you're an athlete, we want you to understand how yoga will take you to the next level, no matter what sport you play. There's a reason the world's most elite athletes and organizations are integrating yoga and mindfulness into their mandatory regiments. We'll break it down for you.If you twist an ankle or break a bone, we want you to have a better sense as to how this is not an isolated event, but that the detrimental effects reverberate throughout your entire body... and we'll share tips and tools for how you can reclaim balance and autonomy in your body during and after recovery.We're digging deep into nutrition and wellness in an effort to help you stay better informed about how you feed and sustain yourself, as well as sharing recipes and meal plans to make it easier to plan and create healthy meals for you and your family. We'll be constructing an online platform for you to connect with the studios, instructors, and yoga community in your neighborhood and beyond.And this is just the beginning of an endless supply of ideas, interviews, tools, and information we're creating to make your life easier, happier, and more complete.

Secondly, with this more complete view of yoga as our inspiration, we're
 designing an edgier, urban-inspired alternative to the status quo. Our 
impeccably-designed activewear will not only provide all the comfort 
and functionality you'll need to hit the studio or the gym, but we're 
dedicated to making sure our Aioga gear will leave you feeling equally 
as comfortable while you're working out as you will running errands 
around town, grabbing a drink with friends, or hitting the skatepark to kick 
it for a few hours after work.                    The second collection of Aioga apparel, our ""Off the Mat"" series, will be designed to take your favorite everyday staples from your wardrobe - your jeans, cords, skirts, dresses, etc - but to construct them using activewear materials and functionality, so you can look and feel like yourself and never feel like you have to hold back from any activity, no matter where your active lifestyle takes you.



  WHAT WE NEED
 Of course, starting an apparel brand and building online tools and resources all cost a lot of money.
We need $50,000 to get this thing off the ground. 
As the apparel will be our primary source of monetization, the majority of this funding will go toward the design and production of our first collections of clothing. This approach will allow us to use the proceeds from our apparel as the fuel to construct the online tools and resources to keep you perpetually learning and endlessly engaged, as well as to continually creating and innovating the clothes and apparel to support your active lifestyle.

RISKS & CHALLENGES

Of course, there's inherent risk in any endeavor, and jumping into the yoga apparel market is no small hurdle.  It's a supersaturated market with some HUGE players and DEEP pockets. 
With that said, we're beyond confident that we can carve out a healthy niche for ourselves by doing exactly what we do best:

Creating highly functional gear for guys to practice in that they’ll feel cool and comfortable in. Somehow, nobody has done this yet... at least not effectively... which is why dudes usually show up to class in a ratty pair of high school gym shorts and a worn out t-shirt from the 2008 company picnic.


For the ladies, we’ll provide an urban-inspired alternative to the monotonous cutesy-lycra look that dominates the industry today… something with a little more edge and personality. Something that suits the stylish, contemporary woman you already are.



While all of our studio wear will be specifically designed to translate seamlessly to your everyday wardrobe, we’ll also create a line of denim jeans, cords, flannels, sweaters, hoodies, etc., all of which will look like your favorite casual wear, but manufactured with high performance active wear to support you perfectly, no matter where your active lifestyle might lead.




THE IMPACT
By no means does our value begin and end with the clothing we provide.Aioga is SO MUCH MORE than just an apparel company. What we're most interested in - what we're 100% dedicated to - is helping people live better, happier, healthier lives. With this broader perspective of yoga serving as the foundation of everything that we do and every decision we make, it's our mission and our intention to bring mindfulness and self-exploration together with fashion and athletics in a way that will be accessible and digestible to different types of people across all walks of Life.

Today, we have found the solution!!! 
Fold up a piece of leather to create this Handmade No-Sew WalletInspired by the Domino House that was designed by the pioneering architect Le Corbusier, we create a magic loft-style mini wallet. The design has maximized both space utilization and storage capacity that is far beyond imagination. We have made the wallet as small as possible and meet the demands of daily life.Fold the note in half and place it on top of the cards to measure the minimum size. Add 5mm stitches and 3mm margin, it becomes 86mm * 94mm in size.Is this the smallest? No, not yet! What not get rid of the 5mm-wide stitches?Yes, we redesign it and get a folding wallet with 5mm less.It is made by folding a piece of leather without sewing. Our designer has studied and tried many folding methods and finally discovered the best solution.The “Handmade No-Sew Wallet” set new standards in wallet design. The seamless finishing not only reduces the size by 5mm but also makes the design look novel.This unique folding structure enhances durability and decreases the deformation remarkably.It is 83×90mm in size, about 16mm in thickness, and about 35g in weight.The wallet has a slim design yet a large capacity.

You can take out anything you need without taking out other things.With the snap button design, you don’t have to worry about your note getting caught by a zipper.The outer is made of hardened vegetable-tanned leather, which is firm and durable that can be used for a long time. The lining is made of pigskin that is wear-resistant and breathable. The leather tanned with tannins extracted from plants is more environmentally friendly and you can enjoy the natural taste of leather. The vegetable tanning process results in leather with distinct durability and flexibility, it develops color and taste changes over time with prolonged use and exposure to the environment, it gets more comfortable the longer you use them.Remove the excess fat and dirt inside the leather, and then put the leather into the vegetable tanned solution.

When you are heeled you may want and can wear it for years.</div><div> </div><div>DJ White has both a Business and Law Degree and a background of success helping ventures off the ground with funding up to seven figures from different types of funding.

<p>All new companies face risk and challenges. With the funds we receive, our FIRST priority is to fulfill the promised products for those of you who believed in us enough to vote with their dollars.</p>

</div><p> </p><p><strong>           </strong></p><p> </p></div>","Ezze Pezze Apparel was started by Joann Dean and DJ White, who both saw a market for clothing that was designed to meet the unique needs of injured people with mobility issues or who have to wear casts due to injury, post op surgical patients, and permanently  disabled. The Problem:People often can't lift their arms over their head, can't stand with ease or are wearing leg or arm cast and can't get the cast into a pant leg or sleeve. There is nothing to meet this market that is affordable, fashionable and functionally designed for use by the wearer.  Several companies can claim one or two but not all three. With your help we hope to change that! As our sample runs we made clothing that was easy to get on and off opening on both sides.  Reason being our clientele do not have to lift or  raise their arms and legs, or be able to stand up to get dressed. Cast wearers can get clothing over it , and closed over the cast. No gaps. When you are heeled you may want and can wear it for years. DJ White has both a Business and Law Degree and a background of success helping ventures off the ground with funding up to seven figures from different types of funding. After looking at this and the lack of companies making a garment that was affordable, fashionable and functional he became convinced a indigo or kick starter campaign would be successful.   
All new companies face risk and challenges. With the funds we receive, our FIRST priority is to fulfill the promised products for those of you who believed in us enough to vote with their dollars.
We produced a variety of clothing. Our samples show what will be our first lines of clothing for men and women. Later Ezze Pezze Apparel will have on-line catalogs, due out three times a year for casual and business wear.

Inside the TrackCup you will find: </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Thermometer:</b> This lets TrackCup collect data about the types of drinks you are consuming as well as lets TrackCup record and analyze your favorite drinking temperatures. </li>
<li>
<b>Pressure Sensor</b>: The pressure sensor is what lets TrackCup track your water consumption. Our team has developed a sensor that can weigh the liquid to determine quantity. The pressure sensors along the lip of the cup can determine whether the liquid is being consumed by a person or poured out. Water that is not consumed but emptied from the cup will not be calculated as consumed water for the day.</li>
<li>
<b>GPS: </b>The GPS chip in TrackCup gives you accurate location data on the TrackCup app. You can find your TrackCup at anytime while simply logging in to your account with your mobile phone. </li>
<li>
<b>Bluetooth Receiver</b>: The Bluetooth receiver allows your TrackCUp to connect to your phone quickly and efficiently. </li>
<li>
<b>Internal Data Storage:</b> We wanted to make sure the TrackCup could be used in all situations and locations. Bluetooth has a reputation for draining your cell phone's battery life throughout the day. TrackCup will continue to collect data even when your smartphone's bluetooth is turned off. All of this data will be stored in the cup's hard drive. Once you connect the cup to Bluetooth again, all the data will sync with your app. </li>
<li>
<b>Accelerometer:</b> The accelerator allows TrackCup to better understand and manage your drinking habits. The accelerator also detects when you have went for long periods of time without drinking and sends you a reminder to drink. </li>
<li>
<b>Battery: </b>The battery life of TrackCup lasts for 6 months on average. (Continuous daily use) </li>
<li>
<b>Chemical Sensor:</b> The chemical sensor is built into the bottom of the cup and allows you to see a full chemical breakdown of common elements found in water. This is a great way to distinguish how safe your drinking water truly is!</li>

Use TrackCup to monitor your drinking behavior and build custom health plans.$285,000 USD raised on Kickstarter! Let's beat our record here! The TrackCup is loaded with sensory technology. Inside the TrackCup you will find: 

Thermometer: This lets TrackCup collect data about the types of drinks you are consuming as well as lets TrackCup record and analyze your favorite drinking temperatures. 

Pressure Sensor: The pressure sensor is what lets TrackCup track your water consumption. Our team has developed a sensor that can weigh the liquid to determine quantity. The pressure sensors along the lip of the cup can determine whether the liquid is being consumed by a person or poured out. Water that is not consumed but emptied from the cup will not be calculated as consumed water for the day.

GPS: The GPS chip in TrackCup gives you accurate location data on the TrackCup app. You can find your TrackCup at anytime while simply logging in to your account with your mobile phone. 

Bluetooth Receiver: The Bluetooth receiver allows your TrackCUp to connect to your phone quickly and efficiently. 

Internal Data Storage: We wanted to make sure the TrackCup could be used in all situations and locations. Bluetooth has a reputation for draining your cell phone's battery life throughout the day. TrackCup will continue to collect data even when your smartphone's bluetooth is turned off. All of this data will be stored in the cup's hard drive. Once you connect the cup to Bluetooth again, all the data will sync with your app. 

Accelerometer: The accelerator allows TrackCup to better understand and manage your drinking habits. The accelerator also detects when you have went for long periods of time without drinking and sends you a reminder to drink. 

Battery: The battery life of TrackCup lasts for 6 months on average. (Continuous daily use) 

Chemical Sensor: The chemical sensor is built into the bottom of the cup and allows you to see a full chemical breakdown of common elements found in water. This is a great way to distinguish how safe your drinking water truly is!
 The TrackCup App provides a platform for users to review their data as well as set new drinking goals and track their overall health. The application has many of the same features that other health and fitness apps have on the market, while also giving you full control of your TrackCup. The app features all of the following:
Step Counting 
Distance traveled 
Water consumption goals 
Water consumption data 
Water chemical breakdown analysis 
GPS tracking
GPS reminders based on location 
Water consumption reminders based on activity 
Music integration 
Running/workout program 
Water consumption and exercise program created by professional nutritionist. 
On demand HELP DESK 
Optional Personal Trainer chat/custom health plan
 Knowing the contents of your drinking water is an extremely important part of being healthy. Many areas of the world today have drinking water that is filled with microscopic chemicals. TrackCup shows you a chemical breakdown of the water in your cup. This is a great way for you to ensure your water is safe to drink! TrackCup Premium comes with a one year subscription to our online personal trainer network. With this, your water consumption data as well as activity data will be sent to a nutritionist and personal trainer for review. Your trainer will be a real person and will provide monthly advice on how you can stay more healthy and active. You can ask this person any question you want about health and fitness! This is an amazing opportunity to consult with a professional and get your body to the place you want it to be! TrackCup Premium is an outstanding value because it provides real and accurate data directly to your trainer. Working with your trainer you can: 
 Build custom weight loss plans. 
Build custom athlete training plans.
Build custom natural diet plans. 
Learn about the TrackCup body cleanse. 
Build custom muscle development plans.
Train for races and marathons.
Build plans for disease prevention.
Get professional support along the way.

</h1><h1><b>Why Speed up bag is so
efficient?</b></h1><p>Classical cyclists' aerodynamic is disastrous so it is possible to reach great
impact on air resistance even with simple aerodynamic accessories, while the
best aerodynamically constructed bicycles reach more than 90% lower air resistance then
standard bicycles. Worlds’ longest distance cycled on one hour for best
aerodynamic bicycles is 56.9 miles (91,5km) while the classical bicycle record
is only 35 miles (56,3km). That enormous difference in speed and air resistance is now smaller thanks to a Speed up bag.</p>
<p><b>Revolution
in form of bicycle bags</b>. Square shape is not aerodynamic. That is why rockets are not cube shaped,
why planes are not square shaped, why cars are no longer square shaped.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289117/files/20140103045829-bag_shape2.jpg?1388753909"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>The same
goes for bags. Still, bike bags did not evolve like other man made products.
Square shape is not aerodynamic, quick and we need more energy to move it
through air than necessary. Aerodynamic bags just weren’t available until now
even though <b>a cube shaped bag is 250% less aerodynamic then Speed up bag</b>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289118/files/20140103045907-_rna_bike_bags.jpg?1388753947"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Revolution
in design</b>. Speed up
bag is designed to correct the most critical aerodynamic area on a cyclist’s
body made of legs and torso. These body parts make a structure in the shape of
a parachute.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289119/files/20140103045950-cyclist_s_parachute2.jpg?1388753990"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>We can see
this parachute even with the best cyclists in the world.</p>
<p>The »Speed
up bag« successfully prevents the activity of a parachute made by the cyclist’s
body. If there is no Speed up bag fitted on a bicycle, parachute made by
cyclist's torso and legs catches air flow freely (left picture). The effect of
Speed up bag is seen in the right picture, where the air flow is not caught in
a parachute.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289122/files/20140103050026-closed_parachute02.jpg?1388754026"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Not
surprisingly, <b>air resistance of cyclist improves (drops) for up to 15% after
the “Speed up bag” is fitted</b>. The better cyclist's technique (body position
on bike), the greater Speed up bag impact on air flow.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289124/files/20140103050057-closed_parachute52.jpg?1388754057"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>The fact is
that a “speed up bag” heavily reduces air resistance of a cyclist and
accelerates speed. Consequently, cyclists will always have a “speed up bag”
fitted on a bicycle even if the bag is empty.</p>
<p><b>4 liters
volume</b>. When it

Why the Speed up bag?First aerodynamic handlebar bag made for more than just to take care of a baggage.Specially designed to reduce air resistance of cyclist, to speed up cycling velocity and to increase cycling pleasure.A new standard in bike bags.Great also for recreational cycling, cycling tours and cycling adventures. Speed up bag increases your cycling range and reduces effort needed for cycling.Bag with results.
 60% less air resistance then normal (cube shaped) bags. It reduces also
 an air resistance of a cyclist for 15%. Tests proved 6% higher cycling 
speeds on average. Up to 10% higher range of electric bicycles.Color and design of choice. You can choose color and printed design on your Speed up bag. Celebrate diversity and match your Speed up bag to your style.Ultra light carbon option. You can also have the lightest Speed up bag made of carbon.International product. Speed up bags will be shipped to our backers worldwide for free.Most importantly, we really appreciate every support! Be sure to catch your pledge and become part of this bicycle bags revolution.
Why Speed up bag is so
efficient?Classical cyclists' aerodynamic is disastrous so it is possible to reach great
impact on air resistance even with simple aerodynamic accessories, while the
best aerodynamically constructed bicycles reach more than 90% lower air resistance then
standard bicycles. Worlds’ longest distance cycled on one hour for best
aerodynamic bicycles is 56.9 miles (91,5km) while the classical bicycle record
is only 35 miles (56,3km). That enormous difference in speed and air resistance is now smaller thanks to a Speed up bag.
Revolution
in form of bicycle bags. Square shape is not aerodynamic. That is why rockets are not cube shaped,
why planes are not square shaped, why cars are no longer square shaped.
The same
goes for bags. Still, bike bags did not evolve like other man made products.
Square shape is not aerodynamic, quick and we need more energy to move it
through air than necessary. Aerodynamic bags just weren’t available until now
even though a cube shaped bag is 250% less aerodynamic then Speed up bag.
Revolution
in design. Speed up
bag is designed to correct the most critical aerodynamic area on a cyclist’s
body made of legs and torso. These body parts make a structure in the shape of
a parachute.
We can see
this parachute even with the best cyclists in the world.
The »Speed
up bag« successfully prevents the activity of a parachute made by the cyclist’s
body. If there is no Speed up bag fitted on a bicycle, parachute made by
cyclist's torso and legs catches air flow freely (left picture). The effect of
Speed up bag is seen in the right picture, where the air flow is not caught in
a parachute.
Not
surprisingly, air resistance of cyclist improves (drops) for up to 15% after
the “Speed up bag” is fitted. The better cyclist's technique (body position
on bike), the greater Speed up bag impact on air flow.
The fact is
that a “speed up bag” heavily reduces air resistance of a cyclist and
accelerates speed. Consequently, cyclists will always have a “speed up bag”
fitted on a bicycle even if the bag is empty.

<p></p>
<p>This Zodiac Jewelry Project is a special tribute in honor of Master Nguyen Tu Nghiem (Born 1922) who passed away on June 15, 2016 at the ripe old age of 94. The designs by a select group of international artist-designers are ""inspired"" by gouache Zodiac paintings of Master Nghiem who was hailed as one of the four ""masters of Vietnamese modern art"".<br/></p>

The East Meeting the West

This Zodiac Jewelry Project is a special tribute in honor of Master Nguyen Tu Nghiem (Born 1922) who passed away on June 15, 2016 at the ripe old age of 94. The designs by a select group of international artist-designers are ""inspired"" by gouache Zodiac paintings of Master Nghiem who was hailed as one of the four ""masters of Vietnamese modern art"".

Considered a national treasure, Nghiem was one of the last graduates of École des
beaux-arts du Viêt Nam (formerly known as École Supérieure des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine) in 1945. He began experimenting and mastering painting with lacquer, employing a simple style, harking back to the old greats of his culture. 





Art, Fashion & Technology

The possibilities of creation are endless with advances in 3D technology rendering artist-designers breathless in trying to keep up. Zodiac Jewelry is making a statement of the owner’s “desire-to-be-different”, combining modernity with classics, and love of nature, turning art into fashion.

Each designer has created a custom Zodiac jewelry design made up of rings, earrings, pendants, bracelets or accessories, and are produce 
primarily by 3D-printing made in brass-gold to titanium with some products handcrafted using materials from gold lace threading to fine filigree silver wiring.

The Zodiac Jewelry of limited edition with a maximum 100 pieces produce for each design of which up to 50 are exclusively offered in this crowdfunding 
initiative before being offered in other planned marketing campaigns of 
aoku3D. Special price perks and free delivery worldwide are part of the 
crowdfunding incentives.
Designer Collective: Democratization of Creation
At
its heart, Zodiac Jewelry is a “Designer Collective”, bringing together a small
group of artist-designers from four corners of Mother Earth free to create and
innovate, rendering “Global Village” a reality.


Dr. Lionel T. Dean from the UK is a pioneer in ""computational design"" having moved away from inventing industrial applications to art and consumer creations using 3D Printing.
Marta Cherednik from Australia is an industrial experimental designer that takes inspirations from science and nature and combines new technologies like 3D printing to produce lighting fixtures, furniture, homewares, fashion accessories and jewelry design objects.
Desmond Chan of Hong Kong took up jewelry making as a hobby as he was unable to find suitable gifts for his wife he decided to try his hand at making unique jewelry using 3D printing.
Ting Tang is the lead designer-founder of Elements Lab in Taiwan, a bespoke jewelry maker that can transform customer designs into high-quality precious metal jewelry pieces with the use of 3D printing.
Tina Koder of Slovenia is a rare innovator who adheres to using traditional 300-year Idrija lace-making techniques to create exceptional jewelry, fashion accessories, home decorations and gift items using the finest of quality materials.
Biljana Klekackoska of Macedonia is a jewelry designer that adopts delicate Filigree jewelry metalwork whose origin may be traced back to Mesopotamia since 3,000 BC to create artistic motifs by mixing new techniques and materials.

Chinese Zodiac & Astrology
By
observing the rule of changes between sky and earth and the four seasons,
ancient Chinese people created the calendar system as early as 2,700 BC,
recording heavenly changes in 60-year cycles made up of ten heavenly stems and
twelve earthly branches; thus came the system of counting time which has been
passed down through thousands of years.





It
may be coincidental that western astrology created by ancient Greek from
Babylonian astronomy (circa mid-1st millennium BC) divides a year into 12
periods; and everyone has a corresponding zodiacal sign according to the period their birthday lies.
The
Chinese Zodiac is based on the twelve earthly branches with each year
corresponding to an animal sign: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse,
sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. It is believed that the years represented
by the Zodiac animals affect the character and personality of the person born
in that year in the same way like the western astrology signs.


It
is further believed some signs are perfect matches while some are less
compatible or even outright born opponents.

<p>Swiss automatic movements have been the benchmark in the watch industry for decades. Our goal was to provide these movements at an accessible, down-to-earth price.

The list of its clients is endless, including high-end brands like IWC, Cartier, Titoni, Tag, Oris, and Montblanc. Just to name a few.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","For thousands of years, humanity has been enamored by the moon’s heavenly dance. The Original S collection takes you back to where horology began, an age when people tracked time by the lunar cycle. These days, premium watches that contain moonphase complications usually reside on the exclusive end of the timepiece spectrum. Now, we are breaking boundaries by bringing you affordable access to this range of timepieces. 
 
Chic or classy? No need to choose only one. Designed with reference to vintage codes, the Original S collection will remain timeless and never go out of style. Built to serve you in a lifetime of adventures, the watch offers exceptional performance in addition to its classic design, ideal for daily and formal occasions.  
 
 
 
 
Inspired from the past, made for today. This is our vision when we created Krons Stone Original S collection. Apart from the vintage moonphase complication, you can tell the time with the contemporary calendar display at a glance. The red second hand is an interpretation of speed that captures the adventurous spirit, giving the timepiece an unique identity - Bold, curious, explore the unknown. 
 
 
 
 
Swiss automatic movements have been the benchmark in the watch industry for decades. Our goal was to provide these movements at an accessible, down-to-earth price. Krons Stone Original S uses the custom edition of  SW-280 by Sellita, one of the top watch movement makers in the world. Sellita produces more than one million movements each year.

Within the movement, 26 rubies are placed at specific points of friction to enhance performance and reduce wear of the metal parts over time. It is a watch that you can wear for decades with the right care.

The constellated double moonphase complication shows moon cycles in northern and southern hemispheres simultaneously, highlighting men's pursuit of a sophisticated lifestyle. The lunar-based indicator is intrinsically poetic in a way that works well with the dial, offering a classic look while appealing to modern tastes. 

 
 
Even with a more down-to-earth price, we only use the finest materials. Each timepiece is crafted with scrupulous detail to ensure unrivaled functionalities and exquisite aesthetics. 
High-degree crystal sapphire 
The case is coated with scratch-resistant sapphire crystal to capture the dial in its most beautiful light. We use a high-degree sapphire crystal to increase light luminosity, creating a radiant effect, and to ensure clear visibility under sunlight from any angle.  
 
Hand-crafted Stainless Crown
The ore-like crown is exclusively designed in-house, and hand-finished with traditional horological artistry. Each crown is crafted and polished with 66 irregular flats for a distinctive touch. This craftsmanship individualizes each watch, creating pieces completely unique to you.  
 
 Swiss Super-LumiNova®
Even in the darkest of nights, the dial gleams magnificently. We use Swiss-Luminova, a non-radioactive, long-lasting luminescence solution that represents the current state-of-the-art. The indexes and hands are coated in layers of Swiss-Luminova for the ultimate brightness and afterglow effect in the dark. 
 
 
Each Original S model is engraved with a unique serial number. Set yourself apart from the realm of the ordinary and make your mark with a unique, stunning horological timepiece.  
 
 
Each of our watches is crafted with first-class materials only seen on watches in five-figure price ranges, yet the Original S costs just a fraction. We want you to have unbounded access to the luxury of Swiss quality watches. We are able to do so using a direct-to-consumer business model that cuts out the middlemen costs and unnecessary markups so the savings can be passed on to you. No more breaking the bank.

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>Toucan Wear is a small company based in Lima Peru that specializes in colorful, quality, handmade shoes. We employ Peruvian families using locally sourced materials and hand make each pair in our family workshop. Our goal is not only to make great shoes you will love, but also give back to the country that’s given us the opportunity to live, work, and create something here. We are focused on sustainability and tie our economic performance to our social and environmental impact. We measure this success using the Triple Bottom Line, sometimes referred to as the 3 Ps: <i>People</i>, <i>Planet</i>, &amp; <i>Profit</i>.</p>
<p><b>People:</b> With our expanding customer base and your support, we are creating jobs that pay a fair wage. Peru is still a developing country submerged in poverty where the minimum salary is only about US$275 per month. We pay a fair price for our shoes so the family we work with can pay their dependents a livable wage. In addition, we have committed to help support 132 children at the <a href=""http://sonrisasenperu.org/projects/westfalia-childrens-village/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Westfalia Orphanage</a>, located just outside of Lima, by donating a percentage of every sale to this fantastic organization.<a href=""http://sonrisasenperu.org/projects/westfalia-childrens-village/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></a></p>
<p><b>Planet: </b>We live in Peru, home to the source of the
Amazon River and The Andes Mountains, the second highest mountain range in the
world. The environment is important to
us. Since our manufacturing processes
are quite simple, we can be certain we are not contributing to environmental
damage.</p>
<p><b>Profit:</b> Our economic performance directly ties back
to our social responsibility score card. By selling more shoes and apparel, we can continue to help the community
and environment around us. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1127162/files/20150102072554-TripleBottomLine_web1.jpg?1420212354"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why do we need
your support?</b></p>
<p>Why do we need your support? We are looking to raise $25,000 to begin a full production run, as well as attend trade shows, gain brand recognition, and establish a larger, global distribution network. This initial funding will jumpstart our business by showing the world the quality of our shoes and the generational craftsmanship of handwoven Peruvian textiles. From here we will be able to create new partnerships with retailers and distributors around the world and expand in our ability to support the local communities that we've come to call home.<br/></p>
<br/><div>
<p><b>The Impact –
Why is this important?</b></p>
<p>As a company, our triple bottom line philosophy— <i>People, Planet, Profit—</i> means we are committed to more than just making money. We actually live here in Peru and see the
challenges that the poor and impoverished face each day. With this in mind, we have partnered with <a href=""http://sonrisasenperu.org/projects/westfalia-childrens-village/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Westfalia Orphanage</a>,  home to 132 children plus staff. They receive no help from the Peruvian
government and are constantly in need of food and supplies— getting enough food being the most difficult challenge they face each month. They are funded completely through donations
by people like you.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>Like any manufacturing process, it presents its fair share of challenges. We have worked
hard over the last eight months making sure we can achieve our goal of supplying you with a really cool, well made pair of shoes, while at the same time helping the children of <a href=""http://sonrisasenperu.org/projects/westfalia-childrens-village/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Westfalia Orphanage</a> to have a better quality of life .</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Toucan Wear is a small company based in Lima Peru that specializes in colorful, quality, handmade shoes. We employ Peruvian families using locally sourced materials and hand make each pair in our family workshop. Our goal is not only to make great shoes you will love, but also give back to the country that’s given us the opportunity to live, work, and create something here. We are focused on sustainability and tie our economic performance to our social and environmental impact. We measure this success using the Triple Bottom Line, sometimes referred to as the 3 Ps: People, Planet, & Profit.
People: With our expanding customer base and your support, we are creating jobs that pay a fair wage. Peru is still a developing country submerged in poverty where the minimum salary is only about US$275 per month. We pay a fair price for our shoes so the family we work with can pay their dependents a livable wage. In addition, we have committed to help support 132 children at the Westfalia Orphanage, located just outside of Lima, by donating a percentage of every sale to this fantastic organization.
Planet: We live in Peru, home to the source of the
Amazon River and The Andes Mountains, the second highest mountain range in the
world. The environment is important to
us. Since our manufacturing processes
are quite simple, we can be certain we are not contributing to environmental
damage.
Profit: Our economic performance directly ties back
to our social responsibility score card. By selling more shoes and apparel, we can continue to help the community
and environment around us. 




Why do we need
your support?
Why do we need your support? We are looking to raise $25,000 to begin a full production run, as well as attend trade shows, gain brand recognition, and establish a larger, global distribution network. This initial funding will jumpstart our business by showing the world the quality of our shoes and the generational craftsmanship of handwoven Peruvian textiles. From here we will be able to create new partnerships with retailers and distributors around the world and expand in our ability to support the local communities that we've come to call home.

The Impact –
Why is this important?
As a company, our triple bottom line philosophy— People, Planet, Profit— means we are committed to more than just making money. We actually live here in Peru and see the
challenges that the poor and impoverished face each day. With this in mind, we have partnered with The Westfalia Orphanage,  home to 132 children plus staff. They receive no help from the Peruvian
government and are constantly in need of food and supplies— getting enough food being the most difficult challenge they face each month. They are funded completely through donations
by people like you.



Risks &
Challenges
Like any manufacturing process, it presents its fair share of challenges. We have worked
hard over the last eight months making sure we can achieve our goal of supplying you with a really cool, well made pair of shoes, while at the same time helping the children of Westfalia Orphanage to have a better quality of life .

I had a good life. The business grew so much so fast beyond my expectations! I was amazed and impress but my dream was to create a very unique shoe line for men as I enjoy shoes myself and had a collection of them. </p><p>As a business owner, I never lost my humble spirit and nobody could even tell I was a boss because I would be running around helping everyone even carrying Tile boxes to customer’s vehicles.</p><p>One time a customer asked me who is the owner of this business in which I replay “I’m the owner” and he thought I was kidding because I was carry boxes and not asking my employees to do everything and I was friendly with my employees.</p><p>I couldn’t ask for more, I was happy and I was about to complete my dream of having my own shoe line! I was very excited! I made different designs and styles of men’s shoes and I was able to found a company in Turkey who was able to manufacture the shoes for me.</p><h3><strong>The accident</strong></h3><p>Everything was going great until disaster strikes! I was involved in a jet ski accident which nearly took my life away. According to witness, I crash in a wave next to a big boat and sank under water they could not find me so I spend nearly 5 min under the water. When they found me, I was unconscious and not breathing. They had to revive me and I was sent by helicopter to the emergency room.</p><p>I lost everything including 80% of my memory. My family is the only who tells me my history and remind me of my life before the accident.</p><p>As for my business, because I was in coma in the hospital my family couldn’t run it I, it was basically closed down.

I had a good life. The business grew so much so fast beyond my expectations! I was amazed and impress but my dream was to create a very unique shoe line for men as I enjoy shoes myself and had a collection of them. As a business owner, I never lost my humble spirit and nobody could even tell I was a boss because I would be running around helping everyone even carrying Tile boxes to customer’s vehicles.One time a customer asked me who is the owner of this business in which I replay “I’m the owner” and he thought I was kidding because I was carry boxes and not asking my employees to do everything and I was friendly with my employees.I couldn’t ask for more, I was happy and I was about to complete my dream of having my own shoe line! I was very excited! I made different designs and styles of men’s shoes and I was able to found a company in Turkey who was able to manufacture the shoes for me.The accidentEverything was going great until disaster strikes! I was involved in a jet ski accident which nearly took my life away. According to witness, I crash in a wave next to a big boat and sank under water they could not find me so I spend nearly 5 min under the water. When they found me, I was unconscious and not breathing. They had to revive me and I was sent by helicopter to the emergency room.I lost everything including 80% of my memory. My family is the only who tells me my history and remind me of my life before the accident.As for my business, because I was in coma in the hospital my family couldn’t run it I, it was basically closed down. Everything I had was sold to pay for all my medical expenses.I may have lost everything but not my spirit, hopes and dreams.What We needAs for my shoes business, the manufacture had already manufacture the shoes and was ready to ship. I had major retailers such as Marshalls, that loved the shoes as it is pure leather, high-quality, very unique and fashionable line of shoes. If I have in stock they are willing to order from me.The funds I need it’s for my first shipment which is about 35-40k to import from Turkey to the USA.Your contribution not only will help me to fulfill this order but will help us to write the history of the brand.The ChallengeMy dream became even bigger because not only I will help people in my condition with part of the shoes profits but also to show that even disable as they claim I am, I’m still able to raise from the ashes and built a business.  But to continue with the shoe production and to build the brand it will be more than the original asking funds but any help is very welcomeOther ways you can helpI believe in the power of people and maybe you are not able to financially contribute but I ask if you can please help us by sharing my story with your friends and family and also help us with your knowledge if you know about this business. Thank you in advance for your help!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

 will only release the full details of how this is financially possible,
 and who pays it at official launch in April 2015 at SHANGHAI Fashion Week. <br/></p>

<p>I’m sorry to beat a dead horse, but getting a job is hard.
So is getting an internship. After starting my own business at 18 (5 years
ago), I learned pretty quickly that presentation matters or no one will take
you seriously. Once I started college I also found out I needed a fitting
wardrobe for entering the professional world. 
Urban Outfitters and Hot Topic just won’t cut it anymore.  </p>
<p>Now that you're in college, you need to take your wardrobe
game up another level. Like to a I-wear-cool-ties-and-socks-to-interviews level
of presentation. A sophisticated level of fashion that frames your youth not as
inexperience, but as an interesting sign that “maybe this kid could bring us
something new and doesn’t wake up at 3:00pm every day and throw on the nearest
clothes”. After all, if a person dresses well, chances are they'll work well.</p>
<p>But not everyone lives in a city where stores with nice
clothes or sold.  Not everyone has the
money to throw down for every outfit at high-end business clothing stores, or
even warehouse chains.  People come from
different backgrounds and experiences, but once we look to enter the
professional world you’re expected to show you can present yourself in a way
that you take <i>your work</i> and <i>your life</i> seriously.</p>
<p>That's where RealPerson.Clothing comes in. You subscribe and
then we send an awesome tie and sock combo to your door each month, along with
shirt and pant suggestions based on your StyleID.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Where's all this coming from? Good question.</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>So 4 years ago when I was going into college, I started a
digital agency. It's hard when you're 18 to walk into a potential client's
office and win over their trust. While my team and I were competent, it was
always important, like I can’t stress enough how super important, to look the
part. If an 18 year old kid walks in and says he can make you a website but is
wearing a sweatshirt, you'll shoo him away and tell him to go loiter elsewhere
(like the 7-11 at the corner). But if they're wearing a tie, fitted shirt, and
some awesome socks that show he's professional but still gets how to make
things cool, you're going to at least let him talk.</p>
<p>My goal is to help gentleman approaching (or already in)
their 20s dress well. If I've learned nothing else after 4 years in business,
it's that when you dress well, you work well. And what better time to start
dressing well than now, in college, when you're out looking for internships and
jobs?  What better time to start than
when you are aiming to start your professional life?</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need is pretty simple and what you get is pretty awesome. Here's the run down:</p>
<p><b>What we need:</b></p>
<p><i>Website</i> - covered by my team.</p>
<p><i>Digital advertising</i> - collateral covered, but will allocate $600 to a Facebook ad campaign.</p>
<p><i>Video campaign - </i>though my team is working on this free, the crew to produce the video still needs to be hired. And then we're going to allocate another $600 to a YouTube promoted video campaign.</p>
<p><i>Product - </i>this is where IndieGoGo comes in. After vetting and ironing out details with several wholesalers, we need $3,000 to get our first combo shipment out.</p>
<p><b><i>Why $5,000 then? What is the point of the ads?</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since we're buying wholesale, our minimum order, depending
on which vendor we actually go with, is anywhere between 250 and 300 items. So
that means we need to get, ideally, that many subscribers to make sure that
we're not wasting money on the orders. The $600 Facebook Ad campaign would
promote the page and our introductory offer coupon (20% off if you prepay for a
whole year). Based on my agency's experience with Facebook and YouTube Ads for
eCommerce shops, that should generate a fair amount of subscribers, though
probably not the full 300.</p>
<p>That's where you guys come in - when you donate, you aren't
just helping us reach our goal on IndieGoGo. You're getting a crazy awesome subscription price
for the perk you back, whether that's one month, three months, half a year, or a year! Hopefully we can get the initial 300 on IndieGoGo alone!</p>
<p>The other $800 will be set aside for incidentals.</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The impact on this project isn't as awesome as some others
on here, we’ll admit that right away. We're not saving the world or fighting
hunger or making an epic zombie movie.</p>
<p>We're just making the young men of the world look a little
better, regardless of where they’re from or their path in life. We want
everyone to look good, bold and sophisticated as they look to enter the
professional world.  And hopefully
they’ll feel a little better, too.</p>
<p>At the same time we also believe in providing affordable, work appropriate clothes. For a generation that's been through one of the toughest economic times in decades (and now looking to enter the workforce), we want to make sure getting socks and ties are the last thing they worry about when it comes to time and money.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Why should we trust you to be the one to make us look awesome?</i></b></p>
<p>I have religiously watched all Mad Men episodes, so I know style.</p>
<p>Actually, though I have watched all Mad Men episodes twice, that's not why you should trust me. I started my first business when I was in 4th grade making trading cards by hand for a Yu-Gi-Oh rip off I invented. I sold, like, 3 game boards and about a dozen cards (at 50 cents each!) to my classmates, but gave away a lot of them, too.</p>
<p>In 7th grade, I started a little school magazine - wrote all the content and made all the comics, too. It wasn't great journalism by any means - it was like a 13 year old's version of The Onion - but I was able to sell a few copies.</p>
<p>Then when I was 18, I started Yellow Box Advertising. We currently have 6 people on our team, and have worked on over 100 projects for clients all over the country. Each year we've grown, and the advertising experience I've gotten there will be key to the success of RealPerson.Clothing.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The only real risk we'll face is not raising enough money to
make our first order. But, if that doesn't happen, then you're getting your
money back because this campaign won't be getting funding.</p>
<p>If we do raise all the money, though, the other risk will be
making sure we reach a sustainable amount of subscribers. That said, so long as
we have at least 300, the business won't be going anywhere.</p>
<p>Another issue we could face is retention. What if we send
out a tie that you guys think is ugly?! No worries. We'll take free returns.
And hopefully, within a month or two of launching, we'll be able to roll out
the StyleID feature that would allow you to choose from different style types
each month. That would necessitate at least 900 subscribers though (3 separate
StyleID categories (TBD) each with the minimum 300 subscribers).</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing the items we ship, we'll be
employing the help of fashion design students at select universities that we'll choose and contact.  They’ll provide us the taste and know how to
choose the right designs to present you professionally, tastefully and the look
to stand out amongst the competition. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>

<h1>Why COBB &amp; Co Watches?</h1>
<p>We created these watches because we saw wood watches being made, but we felt like there was nothing available that you can for both casual and formal situations.</p>
<p>A lot of wood watches use wood just for the sake of using wood. We wanted to make a wood watch where the wood was only used because it added to the look.</p>
<p>We wanted something that you would be comfortable to wear to work, to a meeting, to dinner, or out with friends.</p>

<h1>About us</h1>
<p>The brand COBB &amp; Co. has a long history of innovation. COBB &amp; Co started in 1853 as a horse and coach transport company. When it was founded, the founder Freeman Cobb was only 23. In the harsh Australian conditions, COBB &amp; Co used superior technology in their coaches, had highly experienced horse teams, and had horse teams swap every 25kms so they could go places that nobody else could go, faster than anybody else could go. COBB &amp; Co became synonymous with reliability and speed, and it quickly grew to be the nations largest transport company.</p>
<p>The young entrepreneurial passion, determination, and pure grit is what we strove to bring out in our initial range of watches.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Designing the watches</h1>
<p>When we designed the watches, we had a few core goals</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a natural wood</li>
<li>Use modern materials to bring out the best of the natural wood</li>
<li>3D texture on the dial of the watch</li>
<li>Create something stylish that can be worn day to day</li>
</ul>
<p>We started in December 2012 sketching and designing different concepts.</p>
<p><img alt=""Designing the watches"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/744/887/7a61686670b2612e752033ef3fb66af1_large.jpg?1373768831"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Once we had designs we liked, we spent a lot of time finding the right manufacturer who had experience in working with these materials. From there, we went through a number of different samples, and finally settled on our favourite 11 watches.</p>

<h1>Red Sandalwood ""Freeman Cobb"" Stainless Steel Watch</h1>
<p>The first watch in the COBB &amp; Co. collection is our Red Sandalwood Stainless Steel watch. This watch is inspired by Freeman Cobb, who founded COBB &amp; Co at the age of 23. By all accounts he was a high energy innovator who passionately fought for high standards in the business. This watch is a great everyday watch that’s different enough to draw comments, and stylish so that you can wear it to work.</p>
<p>Comes in a mahogany colored wooden gift box.</p>

<h1>Green Sandalwood ""Casual"" Leather  Watch</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our second watch and my personal favourite is our “Casual Watch”. It’s made from Green Sandalwood, sourced from Mozambique; a brown, genuine leather strap, and a glossy stainless steel case. It’s distinctive look makes it perfect for casual gatherings and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>It comes in a stylish bamboo gift box.</p>
<p>It's available with a COBB &amp; Co style dial or with a classic dial (no wood pattern on the watch face).</p>

<h1>Black Maple Stainless Steel Watch</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our black stainless steel watch is made with Maple wood from North America. The texture on the dial really looks stunning on this watch, and the contrast between the wood and the glossy black stainless steel is sure to draw comments.</p>

COBB & Co. Watches are the first wood watches you can wear for both casual AND formal situations.

Made from natural wood, medical grade stainless steel and genuine leather, COBB & Co. Watches are stylish wood watches different enough for any occasion.




Press
inStash - ""If you’ve been in the market for a watch, but weren’t sure where to start, you may want to keep your eyes peeled.""
That Should Be Mine - ""The latest timepiece to have caught my eye are these rather excellent Cobb & Co. Watches which are a combination of wood and awesomeness.""
Rant Daily - ""Don’t sleep on COBB & Co.’s new launch of wood watches designed for any occasion. Let’s upgrade from the typical timepiece and actually get a conversation started while the watch does all the work.""






Why COBB & Co Watches?
We created these watches because we saw wood watches being made, but we felt like there was nothing available that you can for both casual and formal situations.
A lot of wood watches use wood just for the sake of using wood. We wanted to make a wood watch where the wood was only used because it added to the look.
We wanted something that you would be comfortable to wear to work, to a meeting, to dinner, or out with friends.






About us
The brand COBB & Co. has a long history of innovation. COBB & Co started in 1853 as a horse and coach transport company. When it was founded, the founder Freeman Cobb was only 23. In the harsh Australian conditions, COBB & Co used superior technology in their coaches, had highly experienced horse teams, and had horse teams swap every 25kms so they could go places that nobody else could go, faster than anybody else could go. COBB & Co became synonymous with reliability and speed, and it quickly grew to be the nations largest transport company.
The young entrepreneurial passion, determination, and pure grit is what we strove to bring out in our initial range of watches.




Designing the watches
When we designed the watches, we had a few core goals

Use a natural wood
Use modern materials to bring out the best of the natural wood
3D texture on the dial of the watch
Create something stylish that can be worn day to day

We started in December 2012 sketching and designing different concepts.




Once we had designs we liked, we spent a lot of time finding the right manufacturer who had experience in working with these materials. From there, we went through a number of different samples, and finally settled on our favourite 11 watches.


 

Specifications
Case: High grade stainless steel case, flat glass lens
Case Back: Screw caseback with etching logo
Stainless Steel: High grade stainless steel strap, butterfly clip buckle
Leather: Genuine top layer leather for outer strap, split leather for inner strap
Wood: Maple, Red Sandalwood, Green Sandalwood, Ebony

All our watches are made with medical grade stainless steel, a top quality Miyota 2115 mechanism, oblique dial ring, a fine ribbed pattern behind the roman numerals, and a recessed inner dial with a wood grain pattern. 
The back of the case and the buckle (on our stainless steel watches) are engraved with our logo. 
Our leather straps are genuine leather and made from top layer leather for the outside of the strap and split leather for the inside of the strap. The glass is hardened glass to resist scratching. 
We use four different types of wood. Ebony, Red Sandalwood and Green Sandalwood from Mozambique. Maple from North America. All of the wood is natural, and hasn't been finished with any paint.
Each watch is packaged in a matching gift box.
The watches are water resistant to 30m, but to ensure longevity of the wood, we recommend not to take them with you in the shower or when you go swimming.
Our watches come with a 3 year warranty.

 

 

 


Introducing the COBB & Co. Watch Collection

Here is a close look at each of the watches in our collection.

Red Sandalwood ""Freeman Cobb"" Stainless Steel Watch
The first watch in the COBB & Co. collection is our Red Sandalwood Stainless Steel watch. This watch is inspired by Freeman Cobb, who founded COBB & Co at the age of 23. By all accounts he was a high energy innovator who passionately fought for high standards in the business. This watch is a great everyday watch that’s different enough to draw comments, and stylish so that you can wear it to work.
Comes in a mahogany colored wooden gift box.




 

Green Sandalwood ""Casual"" Leather  Watch


Our second watch and my personal favourite is our “Casual Watch”. It’s made from Green Sandalwood, sourced from Mozambique; a brown, genuine leather strap, and a glossy stainless steel case. It’s distinctive look makes it perfect for casual gatherings and outdoor activities.
It comes in a stylish bamboo gift box.
It's available with a COBB & Co style dial or with a classic dial (no wood pattern on the watch face).







 

Black Maple Stainless Steel Watch


Our black stainless steel watch is made with Maple wood from North America. The texture on the dial really looks stunning on this watch, and the contrast between the wood and the glossy black stainless steel is sure to draw comments.
Comes in a stylish bamboo gift box.

It's time to help!

















My name is Kamil and I have a dream that does not allow me to sleep for a few weeks. I would love to start helping others, but more than ever. I knew I have to raise the money., but how? If I collect them from people I spent it quickly, and again I would have to collect from the beginning. What if I earn them? I thought I'd set up online store with watches and part of the money I earned will be passed on to charities in the world. 













What I Need & What You Get


I need to start a bit of money, but if I don't earn the full amount, I will try to realized my idea, but it will be harder.

Where the funds go?

Why it's important?
Therefore, it will help, especially poor children around the world. I also tried to obtain partners, patrons that helped me. Together, we can achieve when it really help a lot of people. All I need is just a start. And this is the most difficult, which is why I ask for your help.

<h1><strong>Hello Everyone,</strong></h1>
<h1><strong>Welcome to Crownn's Indiegogo page</strong></h1>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.crownn.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.crownn.co.uk</a></strong> </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/8986/files/20130813034146-launch.jpg?1376390506"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Firstly why do you need Crownn?</strong></p>
<p>I've always loved sunglasses, especially those from really luxurious brands! I have always wondered why most people only have one pair and that's all they wear - at Crownn we want to make it feasible to have multiple pairs of luxury glasses without breaking the bank!</p>
<p>Anyway, I came up with the idea for Crownn about 6 months ago when I became fed up that there was no wide range of brightly coloured glasses with that luxurious feel I was craving. All that existed was the kind you buy from street-market stalls, cheap and tacky glasses with rubbish lenses which really aren't that great for your eyes. I am also a massive fan of products that are Made In England, so looked very hard to find another British brand of sunglasses which entirely are Made In England. This was a struggle, and I found myself only finding a few companies which were making the very expensive handmade pairs.</p>
<p>So my mission was set to create;</p>
<ul><li>A wide range of brightly coloured glasses.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>An excellent high quality frame with protective lenses.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>A luxurious, fun and fresh product at an affordable price.</li>
</ul>
<p><b> So, Crownn was born!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/8944/files/20130813031322-logo_..jpg?1376388802"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Alongside all this, we want to be more than just a sunglasses brand - a fun bright brand hosting pop-up shops and awesome parties worldwide, showing that life doesn't have to be 9-5! We will bring happiness and excitement  to you, not conforming with the stereotype of a stuffy boring brand.

<p>The frame is an exciting<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and unique design, we really wanted to create something different to everything else, yet not so outlandish as to be unwearable. They are a combination between the round lens and wayfarer frame. The exclusive hinges wrap around the front of the frame and there is also the awesome brand logo which is embossed into the inside of the arms.  We believe this really finishes them off nicely, creating a luxurious, and more importantly, an affordable product!</span></p>
<p>The frame is injection moulded with the highest quality plastic there is available. Most of the really expensive glasses on the market are made by drilling the shape of the glasses out of a block of acetate, but we have found another, more versatile and effective form of this acetate: Cellulose Acetate Propionate, which is a slight variation on the acetate block. What this really means is that the acetate is in granular form, which is then injected into a mould and out pop the Crownns! The benefits of using this type of plastic are its natural surface gloss, toughness and great impact resistance, along with also being hypoallergenic, as we don't want anyone to be stopped from wearing these sunglasses!</p>
<p>After extensive research, we came to the decision that we will be producing the lenses from CR-39, which will undoubtedly be the best lens for this frame. The lens will be CE registered, signifying that they are EU approved as eyewear, along with their UV400 rating - thus blocking all harmful UV rays, they are multicoated, which basically means it has an anti-reflective coating giving a clearer and crisper image, this multi-coating also makes them scratch resistant!</p>
<p>Also we will have a logo on either arm for the real things!</p>

Hello Everyone,
Welcome to Crownn's Indiegogo page
www.crownn.co.uk 





Firstly why do you need Crownn?
I've always loved sunglasses, especially those from really luxurious brands! I have always wondered why most people only have one pair and that's all they wear - at Crownn we want to make it feasible to have multiple pairs of luxury glasses without breaking the bank!
Anyway, I came up with the idea for Crownn about 6 months ago when I became fed up that there was no wide range of brightly coloured glasses with that luxurious feel I was craving. All that existed was the kind you buy from street-market stalls, cheap and tacky glasses with rubbish lenses which really aren't that great for your eyes. I am also a massive fan of products that are Made In England, so looked very hard to find another British brand of sunglasses which entirely are Made In England. This was a struggle, and I found myself only finding a few companies which were making the very expensive handmade pairs.
So my mission was set to create;
A wide range of brightly coloured glasses.

An excellent high quality frame with protective lenses.

A luxurious, fun and fresh product at an affordable price.

 So, Crownn was born!




Alongside all this, we want to be more than just a sunglasses brand - a fun bright brand hosting pop-up shops and awesome parties worldwide, showing that life doesn't have to be 9-5! We will bring happiness and excitement  to you, not conforming with the stereotype of a stuffy boring brand. We want to break the mould and stand-out from the crowd, so why not join us along the way?



The frame is an exciting and unique design, we really wanted to create something different to everything else, yet not so outlandish as to be unwearable. They are a combination between the round lens and wayfarer frame. The exclusive hinges wrap around the front of the frame and there is also the awesome brand logo which is embossed into the inside of the arms.  We believe this really finishes them off nicely, creating a luxurious, and more importantly, an affordable product!
The frame is injection moulded with the highest quality plastic there is available. Most of the really expensive glasses on the market are made by drilling the shape of the glasses out of a block of acetate, but we have found another, more versatile and effective form of this acetate: Cellulose Acetate Propionate, which is a slight variation on the acetate block. What this really means is that the acetate is in granular form, which is then injected into a mould and out pop the Crownns! The benefits of using this type of plastic are its natural surface gloss, toughness and great impact resistance, along with also being hypoallergenic, as we don't want anyone to be stopped from wearing these sunglasses!
After extensive research, we came to the decision that we will be producing the lenses from CR-39, which will undoubtedly be the best lens for this frame. The lens will be CE registered, signifying that they are EU approved as eyewear, along with their UV400 rating - thus blocking all harmful UV rays, they are multicoated, which basically means it has an anti-reflective coating giving a clearer and crisper image, this multi-coating also makes them scratch resistant!
Also we will have a logo on either arm for the real things!

<p>Even if you don’t ride, the Emily will make the perfect fashion

stands 14 inches tall for when you need more leg coverage or higher

puddles, the garden, barn stalls and even to the snow.  Feedback from wear
testers has put all of these possible scenarios to the test and these boots
pass with flying colors.  I personally
wish I would have created these boots while my daughter was still playing year

Our story
Based on the simple idea of beauty paired with functional
storage, we design products for the modern woman with the goal to simplify her
life. 
LUME has been producing premium all-weather footwear for the
past year. Frustrated with retail, we created a way to make the products we
love, get closer to the people who buy them, and sell them at a price point
that changes the game. Here’s how we're doing it:
Premium women’s all-weather boots, designed in Portland...
For the past 20 years, our small team has been designing, manufacturing and
bringing to retail footwear for some of the biggest brands in the world.  We have earned a reputation for
obsessing over quality, fit, craftsmanship and the classic styling.
Delivered to you at wholesale...


If you purchased our boots at a retailer, you would pay $130. We’ll sell them
directly to you for $60 - $70 a pair, shipped. We’re following this pricing
model for everything we make.

<p></p>
<p><strong><strong>Why </strong>Tightie</strong><strong>s Wallet?</strong></p>
<p>We were frustrated with traditional wallets that seemed to have more material in them than functionality. All that material used to make a wallet made them thick bulky and clunky. Not something we wanted to put in our pockets and sit on or have bulging out. We also wanted something that was better than a traditional wallet. We also felt that wallets seemed overpriced from the big brands out there. We wanted something that we could use to organize our pockets or even a purse. An organizer that had everything you needed all in one place without a whole lot of digging or searching around at the bottom of your pocket or purse.  </p>
<p>We used rubber bands, elastic bands but they either broke, wore out, or just plain looked goofy. We wanted a different kind of wallet that was functional but wasn't like everything else out there,something that was small, compact, easy to use, stylish, kept our pockets organized and was fun. We wanted more than just a wallet. We wanted a pocket organizer. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span>So we set out to do things a little different. What started as a simple sketch by Brooks in a notebook sparked something far better and more functionally designed as we put our heads toghther to design the perfect wallet.</span></p>
<p>With Joe's design background he was able to create the initial digital renderings of the Tighties.  After a few tweaks and sending the renderings back and forth the two brother in laws agreed on a final rendering which was sent to the manufacturer to make temporary sample molds. After months of talking mocking up prototypes, shooting ideas back and forth and working on drawings and renderings,Tighties was born. Why did we call them Tighties? Because they looked like a pair of tighty whitey underwear briefs for your credit cards and business cards. What started off as a pet name while we were developing the product ended up sticking. Not only for the look but also due to the fact that they keep your money, cards, business cards, receipts, keys and change tightly in place.</p>

<p>It is designed to hold 1-7 cards, 3-4 business cards and your cash. So you can carry it all with you or use it when you're going out and want something a little smaller maybe you just want to carry a credit card, id and some cash. We wanted to make something that was flexible. So you could use it to carry just an ID and cash if you're going out for the night on the town. Your Company ID badge and office keys, or all your cash and cards for day to day use.</p>

<p>We wanted a pocket/purse one stop organizational tool. Our essentials when we leave the house today are our keys, wallet and cellphone. All which can be carried in your pants or purse.  The issue is when you have all that stuff in your pocket its moving around maybe scratching your phone's screen, making noise, not easy to access, etc. The other issue is that tracking down all 3 things as well as other items can sometimes prove difficult. We thought it'd be a good idea to combine a wallet and a key to make things simple allowing you to grab them and have them all together when you left your house and easy to pull out of your pocket without having to dig around too long.</p>
<p>The loop also allows you to secure your Tighties Wallet so you won't lose it. You can clip it to your belt, on a lanyard, or inside your backpack or briefcase. No wallet out there allow this much accessibility, flexibility and ease of use. </p>
<p>If you are not into the key ring cable use it separately or you can even cut the loop off to make the wallet more symmetrical and cleaner. Use it with or without we don't really care, but wanted to give you the option. We think once you use it you'll love it. It is nice to have the essentials all together in one place.</p>

<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>A lot of times people assume we are brothers. Probably because we are both tall, extremely good looking and both have a razor sharp wit. Sadly, we are not brothers (to other's and our own disappointment). But we are brothers in law. (Which is pretty much as close to a real brother as you can get without having the same mom).  We live on opposite sides of the country Joe is in the Bronx, New York and Brooks is in Boise, Idaho. We've been talking about doing something for a long time together. I mean heck Joe is an awesome designer and can create anything from thin air. He has an eye for picking just the right colors and styles to make projects perfect. He even designed the Tighties font from scratch.  </p>
<p>Brooks is a business guy who's started his own successful company and been involved international business for almost 10 years. So it just made sense that we finally collaborate on a project. We both have had many ideas (some of them good and most bad) that we've talked about turning into businesses or products over the years. We finally decided it was time to launch one of our good ideas together and so the Tighties Wallets project was born.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We don't come into this project without qualifications, so you can trust that we'll be able to deliver. What's that? You want to know what kind of qualificatoins? Ok, you want qualifications? Here you go:</p>
<p> Joe has got a Masters in Design and has worked in the advertising world in New York for the past couple years with a lot of companies you know and love, and likely interact with on a regular basis. He has helped create campaigns for companies like Macy's, Lean Cuisine, Jetblue and Drumstick Ice Cream. He is currently working for a hip consumer goods company that makes products for your home as the in house designer.</p>
<p>Brooks has a Masters in International Business and has worked in the corporate world for the last 7 years. He recently launched his own company which has been a big success with products being sold all over the world, as well as being worn by some famous individuals like Snoop, Beyonce, Orlando Bloom, etc . Brooks has a background in marketing, manufacturing and sourcing.</p>

We were frustrated with traditional wallets that seemed to have more material in them than functionality. All that material used to make a wallet made them thick bulky and clunky. Not something we wanted to put in our pockets and sit on or have bulging out. We also wanted something that was better than a traditional wallet. We also felt that wallets seemed overpriced from the big brands out there. We wanted something that we could use to organize our pockets or even a purse. An organizer that had everything you needed all in one place without a whole lot of digging or searching around at the bottom of your pocket or purse.  
We used rubber bands, elastic bands but they either broke, wore out, or just plain looked goofy. We wanted a different kind of wallet that was functional but wasn't like everything else out there,something that was small, compact, easy to use, stylish, kept our pockets organized and was fun. We wanted more than just a wallet. We wanted a pocket organizer. 

So we set out to do things a little different. What started as a simple sketch by Brooks in a notebook sparked something far better and more functionally designed as we put our heads toghther to design the perfect wallet.
With Joe's design background he was able to create the initial digital renderings of the Tighties.  After a few tweaks and sending the renderings back and forth the two brother in laws agreed on a final rendering which was sent to the manufacturer to make temporary sample molds. After months of talking mocking up prototypes, shooting ideas back and forth and working on drawings and renderings,Tighties was born. Why did we call them Tighties? Because they looked like a pair of tighty whitey underwear briefs for your credit cards and business cards. What started off as a pet name while we were developing the product ended up sticking. Not only for the look but also due to the fact that they keep your money, cards, business cards, receipts, keys and change tightly in place.




So what exactly can you put in your Tighties Wallet?



Credit cards


ID Cards


Membership Reward Cards


Business cards


Security or ID Badges


Money (Bills and Coins)


Keys


Receipts


Memory Cards


USB Devices

Small Pen or Pencil


Love Letters


A token or two


To-do lists

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Self expression, beauty, nature and human nature alike are the things that inspire me the most. Join me in this journey of self-exploration and artistic quest. I am raising funds to start up a jewellery and fashion brand and I need your help to make my dream come true.</p>
<p>My name is Paula Adina and I’ve always been passionate about beauty and art. As a graduate of the University of Fine Arts, licensed in Design, I worked as a furniture designer, interior designer, I did some illustration and graphic design, visual identities and finally, web design, but none of these made me feel accomplished. I’ve always been drawn towards art, painting, colours, jewellery and fashion design. They’ve been obsessively messing with my mind for the last years. So, I went along with this obsession and I experimented a little with materials, textures, fabrics, colours and paint.</p>
<p>Inspired by the great fashion designers and also by the folk art, mesmerised by the beauty of the intricate hand embroideries and the uniqueness of the fabrics, I also tried to do some hand embroidery and clothing designs. As for the jewellery, I love the way raw, almost untouched by man materials such as wood and stone go along with the highly finished, glossy look of precious metal, gems and crystals.</p>
<p>Until now, all of my jewellery pieces, clothing items and embroidery work were merely experiments. Some of them you can see in the video and pictures attached to this campaign.  But now I decided I want to take all this to the next level and I need your help to do it.</p>

<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The things that can give a boost to my artistic growth are the followings:</p>
<p>1. The first and the most important of all is support. I need encouragement and reassurance that I’m doing a good job and that people like and need my work. Without your appreciation I am nothing ;).</p>
<p>2. Materials (precious metals, beads, pearls, stones, crystals, fabrics, etc.)</p>
<p>3. One sewing machine.</p>
<p>4. Salary for a tailor or two to help me create more clothing items (for a period of two years).</p>
<p>5. A nice looking webshop for all the products to be displayed and sold on.</p>
<p>For all these I estimated that I need to gather around 30 000 dollars. Even if I don't reach my entire goal, I will still continue creating jewellery and fashion design, but at a slower pace. The money raised through this campaign, regardless of the amount, will go, first of all, on materials, advertising and rebranding.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get in Return</h3>
<p>Every effort and kind words and support will be gratefully rewarded. The time has come to let my ""babies"" fly away and find their home with their rightful owners and so, some of my work, along with my gratitude, will stand as a sincere “Thank You” for your kind help. Everybody will get the perks even if the targeted sum is not reached.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Self expression, beauty, nature and human nature alike are the things that inspire me the most. Join me in this journey of self-exploration and artistic quest. I am raising funds to start up a jewellery and fashion brand and I need your help to make my dream come true.
My name is Paula Adina and I’ve always been passionate about beauty and art. As a graduate of the University of Fine Arts, licensed in Design, I worked as a furniture designer, interior designer, I did some illustration and graphic design, visual identities and finally, web design, but none of these made me feel accomplished. I’ve always been drawn towards art, painting, colours, jewellery and fashion design. They’ve been obsessively messing with my mind for the last years. So, I went along with this obsession and I experimented a little with materials, textures, fabrics, colours and paint.
Inspired by the great fashion designers and also by the folk art, mesmerised by the beauty of the intricate hand embroideries and the uniqueness of the fabrics, I also tried to do some hand embroidery and clothing designs. As for the jewellery, I love the way raw, almost untouched by man materials such as wood and stone go along with the highly finished, glossy look of precious metal, gems and crystals.
Until now, all of my jewellery pieces, clothing items and embroidery work were merely experiments. Some of them you can see in the video and pictures attached to this campaign.  But now I decided I want to take all this to the next level and I need your help to do it.

What I Need
The things that can give a boost to my artistic growth are the followings:
1. The first and the most important of all is support. I need encouragement and reassurance that I’m doing a good job and that people like and need my work. Without your appreciation I am nothing ;).
2. Materials (precious metals, beads, pearls, stones, crystals, fabrics, etc.)
3. One sewing machine.
4. Salary for a tailor or two to help me create more clothing items (for a period of two years).
5. A nice looking webshop for all the products to be displayed and sold on.
For all these I estimated that I need to gather around 30 000 dollars. Even if I don't reach my entire goal, I will still continue creating jewellery and fashion design, but at a slower pace. The money raised through this campaign, regardless of the amount, will go, first of all, on materials, advertising and rebranding.

What You Get in Return
Every effort and kind words and support will be gratefully rewarded. The time has come to let my ""babies"" fly away and find their home with their rightful owners and so, some of my work, along with my gratitude, will stand as a sincere “Thank You” for your kind help. Everybody will get the perks even if the targeted sum is not reached.

When the Apple Watch was finally released, we were excited and disappointed at the same time. We immediately realized that the bands offered by Apple were both lacking an individual touch and a fair price. That’s when we decided to do something about it and founded the label WRBLS. We are driven by the will to provide Apple Watch users with unique, fashionable and fairly-priced bands. In our view the Apple Watch is more than just a watch. It represents an unique lifestyle and constitutes a sophisticated fashion item that lets its users stand out from the crowd.That is why we are aiming at making this personal item even more personal by bringing our one-of-a-kind collection to you.Functionality: Our bands are ergonomically shaped, water-repellent and UV-light resistantDesign: Our collection contains unique, timeless and classy designs catering to different tastesAfter a dozen of heated arguments and a bunch of fervid discussions, we finally came up with the first WRBLS collection featuring three different lines catering to different tastes: Urban Stylers, Business Casual and Sporty.We used high-performance silicone polymer as base material – an extremely resistant, water and sweat repelling, tear-proof and durable material – and combined this with a state-of-the-art pin-and-tuck closure technology to ensure an easy swap of bands. The result is a band that perfectly fits to your wrist. The bands are coming in an individual and unique design. They can be easily swapped, quickly adapting your watch band to daily clothing and special occasions.Lug and latch system: Our bands are coming with integrated lugs and an extremely practical pin-and-tuck closure systemClose-up shots of our bands: Designed and crafted with great love for detailErgonomic shape: The bands are ergonomically-shaped to perfectly fit your firstPrinting: We developed a sophisticated printing method to turn our designs into reality

The Chronovisor team is comprised of experienced professionals who care deeply about the work they produce, and are dedicated to striving for the best. Our goal with this project is to develop a truly unique timepiece of the highest quality, and to make it available to all at an affordable price. All Chronovisor products are created with the finest materials, by a team of highly skilled horological professionals in Switzerland. Our timepieces undergo 360 hours of rigorous testing to ensure each one meets our high standards of quality and durability. We are committed to everyone who supports our vision and we are very serious about providing the very best in after sales service, which means even after purchasing your Chronovisor timepiece, we will be here to answer any and all questions or enquiries you may have.</p><p>2) What is the size of the watch?</p><p>The diameter of the case is 43mm and the thickness is 12.35mm.</p><p>3) Is the back of the case transparent?</p><p>Yes! The case back is transparent. The see through nature of the design means the inner mechanical workings of the watch can be viewed through the back. Sapphire crystal is used for the back case to ensure the best quality.  </p><p>4) Why use a titanium case?  </p><p>Due to its rarity, Titanium is usually more expensive than other types of metal, such as steel, aluminium and iron. Titanium possesses unique qualities which makes it the best choice when designing a durable and high quality timepiece. Titanium is hypoallergenic, non-magnetisable and is naturally resistant to rust and corrosion. it is among the strongest and most durable metals on the planet. In fact, Titanium possesses the highest strength-to-density ratio of any metallic element on the periodic table. The Chronovisor CVGM7102 utilizes these qualities, with each one being equipped with a titanium case.</p><p>5) What is Super-LumiNova paint?</p><p>Super-LumiNova is a luminescent pigment, which can be found on the inner bezel of the Chronovisor CVGM7102. It is a non-radioactive, photo-luminescent pigment, allowing the wearer to read the time in reduced light settings. While in the dark, the luminescence will decrease over time but will be restored as soon as the watch is once again exposed to light. Super-Luminova pigments can glow for approximately 8-10 hours in the dark.  </p><p>6) What is the watch movement?</p><p>Chronovisor is set with Miyota 8217 automatic movement. It is with 24 hour display function, 21,600 vibrations per hour and power reserved to 40+ hours. Miyota 8217 is a renowned automatic caliber in worldwide. The quality is excellent for both accuracy and durability</p><p>7) Is there a screw-in crown?</p><p>All Chronovisor timepieces are engineered with screwed in crowns. To adjust the time on the watch, the crown is connected to the movement by the winding system. The crown can be unscrewed before being pulled out and rotated. The screw-in crown is also the best design to protect the watch against water and guarantees the wearer the highest level of water resistance. Once the time has been adjusted, the crown should be pushed back in and tightly screwed back. </p><p>8) What is the strap made of? </p><p>Chronovisor uses nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) straps, and we believe it is the most comfortable rubber strap on the market. It is very soft yet durable and stain resistant. It will not pull the wearer’s hairs or attract lint. It is a great choice for swimmers, and stands up well to salt and sunlight. </p><p>9) What is about the buckle? </p><p>Unlike other watchmakers, Chronovisor does not use any OEM alloys. The buckle of the CVGM7102 is made of stainless steel, and is designed specifically for Chronovisor watches, emblazoned with an embossed logo. </p><p>10) What’s included in the package? </p><p> Everyone who orders the CVGM7102 will also receive an extra strap (either NBR or Italian leather), a 16GB USB flash drive and a guarantee card.</p><p>11) What’s on the flash drive? </p><p>The Chronovisor flash drive has the user manual installed on it. Not only this, its unique appearance and custom design is evocative of Chronovisor’s pioneering spirit and is exclusively available to those who order the CVGM7102. It is a small token of our gratitude for those who believe in our vision.</p><p>12) Will my CVGM7102 need a battery? </p><p> As an automatic watch, your Chronovisor CVGM7102 does not require a battery. It is powered by you! </p><p>13) Will I need to keep winding the watch? </p><p>Upon receiving your Chronovisor CVGM7102, you should turn the crown 40 times, which causes the ratchet wheel wheel to rotate. The mainspring will then be fully winded. Afterwards, you can wear your Chronovisor without having to wind it again.</p><p>14) Does it come with a warranty? </p><p>We’ve got you covered! Chronovisor offers a 2 year limited warranty. During this time, any repairs that need to be made to your watch will be completed free of charge. This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, or incidental damage.</p><p>15) When do I need to pay? </p><p>Your card will be charged as soon as the campaign comes to an end. Once the funding goal has been reached and the campaign’s time has run out, all orders will be processed. You should see a charge on your account between 3-5 days after the campaign ends. </p><p>16) Is the shipping charge included? </p><p>Shipping to a number of countries and territories is included in the cost. If you wish for your order to be delivered to the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the shipping charge will be included. For orders to be shipped to the rest of the world, there will be a shipping charge of US$30. </p><p>17) Can you help me further if I still have a question?</p><p>No problem!

<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p>Since we believe that perception creates reality, we want to help people realize that they can change the world simply by changing the way they look at it. Instead of perceiving the Earth as billions of individuals, we want people to see it more as a collective organism. We believe that our perception of time is the key to realizing this interconnectedness. While raising awareness and understanding, the InfiniTPeace will help shift people’s focus to the present moment by providing the Time-Peace symbol and philosophy as a reminder through the time-telling device that defines our lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Thank You</h1>
<p>Convincing people that a watch can actually help change the world has been the greatest challenge Time-Peace has faced since its fruition. The InfiniTPeace campaign is an attempt to spread the word that challenges not only us, but everyone collectively. In order to reach as many people as possible we are inviting family, friends, our fans, blogs, and independent writers to help us share our message. With your help, we can make our dream of restoring a peaceful consciousness to the world a reality. Thank you so much for your support. It’s time to stop worrying and start Being.</p>

</div></div>","Time-Peace is an intergalactic watch company aimed at helping people change their perception of time so they can stop worrying and start Being. Our goal is to create a shift in the way we view the world by realizing our interconnectedness in the present moment. The Time-Peace symbol is an integration of four universal principles that can help anyone live in the Now and create a foundation for peace.
Time is an illusion.The only moment that ever exists is Now.

Perception creates reality.You can change the world by changing the way you look at it.

Everything is interconnected.All is one, so love everyone.

The Universe is in alignment.You are where you need to be, so stop worrying and start Being.

The primary function of a Time-Peace is not to tell you the clock time, but to remind you to be present in the only moment that ever exists - Now. We're trying to help people free themselves from the effects of psychological time, the negative energy created when we resist or disassociate ourselves from the present moment to stress or worry about the past or future. However, we can still use clock time as a tool to function in society.

We’re ready when you are!</p></div>","CONCEPTWe never really understood why hardly any watchmakers, not even premium brands, are offering real customization options. Car manufacturers certainly know how to do it. Sneaker brands too. So why not watches? The explanation is pretty simple. It’s complex, time-consuming and expensive. And why bother, if you can just convince your customer to go with the standard offering. But nothing really worth doing is ever easy. And with 20 years of production experience with limited series of custom and promotional watches, and our recent successful endeavour with the Flash Automatic GMT, we’re ready to take on the task. And the best thing is, that for you, it will be neither complex, time-consuming or expensive. The customization process is easy and playful, and the price is way below standard watches with the same premium components that we use.     DESIGN  Our goal with Miang Copenhagen Bespoke was to design a truly customizable watch with an elegant and sporty look as well as obvious traces to our Danish design heritage. And we wanted to do it using nothing but custom-designed components. With so many interchangable parts and design combinations we knew, that we had to come up with an extremely strong design system. For this challenging task we asked one of Denmark’s leading industrial designers, Mr. Jan Egeberg, to help us out.    We worked a great deal with surface treatments for the watchcase, which is both brushed and polished, creating different looks dependent on the way surrounding light falls on the case and the angle from which you look at it. Finally, the case is paired with a monumental crown.   The shape and characteristic surfaces emit a meticulous visual appearance and superior legibility. This sense of precision continues in each of the customizable parts allowing for a varied yet always complete design language, no matter which combination you go for.  The lightness of the titanium watch case combined with its curves that follow the wrist naturally, makes the watch extremely comfortable to wear. 

 
Bezel options in natural, black PVD and red gold PVD titanium as well as in solid carbon fiber.With the interchangeable bezel and quick-change straps you can easily alter the appearance of your watch quite dramatically and go from sports watch for the tennis court to an elegant timepiece worthy of your following gala event.  CUSTOMIZING OPTIONS  The vast amount of customization options gives you an almost unlimited number of different looks to choose from. But don’t worry. We’ve made the process fun and easy. Have a go at www.miangcopenhagen.com   Lume on dial and hour- and minute hands. PERSONAL ENGRAVING Your watch is delivered with a personal laser engraving of your choice at no extra charge. Your message is accompanied by your watch’s individual serial number.   Your engraving can consist of 30+25 characters (including spaces) built for... Love you... Congratulations... QUALITYGrade 5 titaniumWe wanted to make a watch from the finest materials and components out there.For the watchcase, the crown and buckle we decided on Grade 5 titanium. Titanium is a great and luxurious material that’s 3 times stronger than steel but at half the weight. And it’s allergy-friendly too. Unlike other titanium types, Grade 5 can be polished to a mirror-like finish. A feature we implemented on several of the surfaces.  Sapphire crystalSapphire crystal is priced for its near diamond hardness making the glass extremely strong and scratch-resistant with a superior optical transmission. The backside of the glass is coated with anti-reflective properties to reduce glaring. Both front and back of the watch are equipped with this sapphire crystal. MOVEMENT The fine finishing automatic movement as seen through the sapphire glass exibition window. The Miang Copenhagen Bespoke is built on a mechanical movement with automatic winding that’s powered by the movement of your wrist. No need for batteries or hand winding.When you are in the market for a high quality movement, there are really just two places to go: Switzerland and Japan. We chose the Japanese fine finishing movement ca. 8217 from Citizen-owned Miyota. Compared to a Swiss ETA or Selitta movement, the quality of the 8217 can easily compete. It just comes with less of the overhead that always goes along with a “Swiss-made” tag, which means that we can offer great quality at a really great price. We customized the movement by electroplating the rotor in a stunning blue color and engraving the “M” logo.  STRAPS  As with everything else with this timepiece, we handpick the best materials for our straps – no matter where this takes us around the world. We get our calfskin in whole hides from Italy, our suede in Denmark and salmon leather from Brazil. All straps are hand-stitched and lined with soft and comfortable suede on the backside. Salmon leather from Brazil Tan calfskin in whole hides from Italy Black calfskin in whole hides from Italy Straps are supplied with buckles in the same color as the watch case body. Understated: In order to avoid spoiling the beautifully polished surface of the buckle, we have chosen to engrave the logo on the backside rather than on the usual front. PACKAGING We firmly believe that this watch will be your new favorite timepiece. For this reason we decided to give it an exclusive travel pouch with room for your watch, extra strap, bezel, screws and the enclosed screwdriver. This allows you to easily change the look of your watch, even when you’re traveling. No need to bring several watches for different occasions.  Naturally, your customized watch will arrive fully assembled. The travel pouch shown with an optional strap and bezel. Customs duties, VAT & shipping All watches are shipped with either UPS, DHL or Fedex depending on destination country. Shipping charges to backers doorstep are included in the pledge (so called incoterms DAP - delivery at place). Customs duties, fees and VAT are not included in the pledge and must be paid separately by the backer, if applicable.   SPECIFICATIONS   THE FUTURE OF MIANG COPENHAGEN We created Miang Copenhagen with the goal of establishing a watch brand that gives the creative freedom and personal style choice back to the wearer. Individual watches with the potential of many changing looks – essentially offering multiple watch designs in one. And we are offering it without expensive middlemen.This business model saves our customers more than 50% compared to the traditional retail model! And our concept works! Our first watch is sold online to clients all over the world, and the next step is to make our website and watches even more accessible to our global fans of customizable watches. A showroom and boutique in our native Copenhagen is also on the drawing board.  WARRANTY  Every Miang Copenhagen watch comes with a 2-year international warranty. In fact we believe so much in our product that we provide each watch with a 100-day money back guarantee – no questions asked! THE TEAM  RISKS & CHALLENGES Several things can potentially obstruct and delay a project of this kind.

<h2><strong>What is the ChairAmiGo™ Project? </strong></h2>
<p>     Hi! we are the Dreyer Family and we created a patent pending accessory<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chairamigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/family.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> which<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chairamigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/family.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chairamigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/family.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> universally attaches to the millions of collapsible “sports chairs” in use today.  Our goal is to use it to create one sustainable American textile manufacturing job by the end of this year. To do this, we need your help by Sept. 30.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Please view our video for a demonstration!</strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Why get involved?</strong></h2>
<p>     1. It's a <strong>great</strong> product/gift!</p>
<p>     2. Your involvement <strong>not only helps to launch a new business</strong> and an innovative idea, <strong>it helps create and sustain real jobs for a local textile manufacturing company</strong> which was started several years ago by workers who lost their jobs when their previous company sent all its manufacturing overseas. Part of this project is to prove that manufacturing in America still works! It’s a small project, but <strong>we have to start somewhere</strong>.</p>
<p>     3. <strong>If we can get 300 preorders by Sept. 30<sup>th</sup> – we will “prove” the market</strong>, and put this product into larger production.  <strong>Our goal is to create one sustainable full time American textile manufacturing job by the end of this year.</strong>  Next year we hope to grow.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>     <strong>What we need is simple! Orders!</strong> We simply need people to watch our video and order the product if they would like to have one for themselves or give one (or more) as a gift.  We structured and timed this as an opportunity to do some early Christmas shopping!

<p>      We decided to be serious about this and make a minimum threshold of 300 units.

<p>     <strong>Quality Construction:</strong> Each ChairAmiGo™ is constructed of rugged 600 Denier nylon fabric with a waterproof interior coating.

<p><strong>     Color:</strong> We have selected <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Black</span></strong> as our initial color, which will coordinate with the widest variety of logos, team colors, etc.  </p>
<p>     <strong>The poncho</strong> which we provide in the standard package has a suggested retail value of over $25 by itself. This poncho is made in China and is provided as a bonus to help get the ChairAmiGo™ off the ground.  </p>

<p> </p></div>","What is the ChairAmiGo™ Project? 
     Hi! we are the Dreyer Family and we created a patent pending accessory which universally attaches to the millions of collapsible “sports chairs” in use today.  Our goal is to use it to create one sustainable American textile manufacturing job by the end of this year. To do this, we need your help by Sept. 30. 
Please view our video for a demonstration!
Why get involved?
     1. It's a great product/gift!
     2. Your involvement not only helps to launch a new business and an innovative idea, it helps create and sustain real jobs for a local textile manufacturing company which was started several years ago by workers who lost their jobs when their previous company sent all its manufacturing overseas. Part of this project is to prove that manufacturing in America still works! It’s a small project, but we have to start somewhere.
     3. If we can get 300 preorders by Sept. 30th – we will “prove” the market, and put this product into larger production.  Our goal is to create one sustainable full time American textile manufacturing job by the end of this year.  Next year we hope to grow.
What We Need & What You Get
     What we need is simple! Orders! We simply need people to watch our video and order the product if they would like to have one for themselves or give one (or more) as a gift.  We structured and timed this as an opportunity to do some early Christmas shopping! The Sept. 30 deadline allows us time to deliver the first 300 in time for Christmas.
      We decided to be serious about this and make a minimum threshold of 300 units. If we can’t hit that, we can’t realistically reach our goal of creating one sustainable textile job and will call off the project to reevaluate.  So please don’t hesitate – if you’d like to be part of this, please jump on board today and invite all your email, Facebook, Twitter, etc. friends. Remember if we don’t reach our funding goal, you recieve a full refund of your contribution within 5 days of the campaign deadline of Sept. 30th.

Personalization
     The ChairAmiGo™ can be embroidered, printed or otherwise personalized in any number of ways. Initially, we are creating personalized button zipper pulls.
It is very important that you supply us with either a logo or the 3 initials for a monogram (in the exact order you want them) by email – include identifying information, so that we can match your button with your ChairAmiGo™ order.  The zipper pull is a 1¼” circle so keep that smaller size in mind.

<p>Working with local cooperatives, we upcycle and recycle remains of weapons of conflict into jewelry. Transforming an object traditionally symbolizing negativity into change, we fuse history and a strong message into each our our jewelry pieces. We believe that our jewelry can be a catalyst for conversation and awareness of the situation in Laos.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>**The project to upcycle war scraps was founded through the RISE (Rural Income through Sustainable Energy) Project that sponsors Ban Napia, Laos through collaboration between Helvetas, Sunlabob, and the Laotian government</p>
<p>MAG (Mines Advisory group)
Community Liaison staff have worked with both the artisans and the scrap metal
suppliers, educating them on safety precautions. </p>
<p>* Sources of the aluminum used to make the jewelry include the stabilization fins of cluster bomb casings, flares, certain fuses
and parts of fighter jets.</p>

</div></div>","The Purple Buddha Project in Laos, one of the most bombed countries in the history of mankind, is upcycling remains of weapons of conflict into jewelry, with a strong messages embedded into each piece.Made with fair-trade artisans to spread awareness of the situation of Laos, a donation of 9 meals for each jewelry piece sold is made to schools in Southeast Asia that sponsor children that attend school free of cost.
If you are intersted in writing about Purple Buddha Project, please contact us at Admin@purplebuddhaproject.com

Press Kit Dropbox Link





















Working with local cooperatives, we upcycle and recycle remains of weapons of conflict into jewelry. Transforming an object traditionally symbolizing negativity into change, we fuse history and a strong message into each our our jewelry pieces. We believe that our jewelry can be a catalyst for conversation and awareness of the situation in Laos.

**The project to upcycle war scraps was founded through the RISE (Rural Income through Sustainable Energy) Project that sponsors Ban Napia, Laos through collaboration between Helvetas, Sunlabob, and the Laotian government
MAG (Mines Advisory group)
Community Liaison staff have worked with both the artisans and the scrap metal
suppliers, educating them on safety precautions. 
* Sources of the aluminum used to make the jewelry include the stabilization fins of cluster bomb casings, flares, certain fuses
and parts of fighter jets.














We believe that employment and a job is the most reliable and sustainable way to inject change into a country rather than any other form of assistance. In order to create a stable form of income, we work to collaborate on modern design input as well as by providing market access to their goods.







With the purchase of each jewelry piece, we make a donation of nine meals to a school in Southeast Asia that sponsors children to attended school free of cost. The children of these heavily bombed countries are the least deserving of having to suffer the consequences from the mistakes of the past.





          


The Purple Buddha Project was established after a year long backpacking trip by the founder around the world to better understand himself. Initially started in a dorm room , the Purple Buddha Project has come a long way from its' founding, establishing itself firmly in Cambodia today. With three years experience of having created a unique product in not so ideal environments, we have the absolute confidence in creating a memorable collection in Laos.

But due to the nature of my business model, the things I need to launch are going to be a bit more expensive than if I was going to typical stores or bulk ordering from huge factories in China and Bangladesh.As a side note, my clothes are aimed at female adults, but I am more than willing to make clothes for people of any gender or age! Don't feel like you're excluded because of who you are!You may be looking at this campaign and feeling disappointed because you can't toss a dollar my way. That's okay! You can help make this a reality by:
Getting the word out! Social media, word of mouth, however you wish! Let people know about me and send them here!

<p><strong>SCURO watches philosophy is simple :  </strong></p>
<p>To create a timeless sport watch in a lightweight and strong titanium case that is powered by a high quality automatic mechanical movement with the goal of bringing you premium quality products at fair pricing.  </p>
<p>Since 2016, we have launched 2 Kickstarters successfully, raising over 160K and delivering to over 500 backers.  </p>
<p>After a year of designing, finding a manufacturer capable of producing the design, and product testing - we are proud to present SCURO Volante watches.</p>

<p><strong>Titanium  </strong></p>
<p>Titanium is the most commonly used for aircraft or military applications due to its high strength and low weight, the best among all metals. Titanium is also hypoallergenic, meaning it is perfectly safe for the human body. In fact, doctors use it for hip and knee replacements for this very reason.</p>

<p><strong>Forged Carbon  </strong></p>
<p>Forged carbon is created under extreme pressure to offer the lightest, yet strongest material available. It is created from carbon fiber strands and forged to achieve its legendary strength to weight ratio, unmatched even by titanium. Scuro Volante watches are made from the same materials used in a Fighter jet, F1 Race Car, Lamborghini, Bugatti Veyron and many ultra-luxury watches. The Volante is extremely strong, but also deceptively light. ( Watch weight - 65 grams with forged carbon case-sides and rubber straps )</p>

<p><strong>DLC - Diamond-Like Carbon coating  </strong></p>
<p>A DLC-finish will harden your timepiece, making it more resistant to shocks and scratches. The finish will also keep its polish or sheen no matter what kind of abuse you subject it to.</p>

</div></div>","SCURO watches philosophy is simple :  
To create a timeless sport watch in a lightweight and strong titanium case that is powered by a high quality automatic mechanical movement with the goal of bringing you premium quality products at fair pricing.  
Since 2016, we have launched 2 Kickstarters successfully, raising over 160K and delivering to over 500 backers.  
After a year of designing, finding a manufacturer capable of producing the design, and product testing - we are proud to present SCURO Volante watches.


Titanium  
Titanium is the most commonly used for aircraft or military applications due to its high strength and low weight, the best among all metals. Titanium is also hypoallergenic, meaning it is perfectly safe for the human body. In fact, doctors use it for hip and knee replacements for this very reason.

Forged Carbon  
Forged carbon is created under extreme pressure to offer the lightest, yet strongest material available. It is created from carbon fiber strands and forged to achieve its legendary strength to weight ratio, unmatched even by titanium. Scuro Volante watches are made from the same materials used in a Fighter jet, F1 Race Car, Lamborghini, Bugatti Veyron and many ultra-luxury watches. The Volante is extremely strong, but also deceptively light. ( Watch weight - 65 grams with forged carbon case-sides and rubber straps )

DLC - Diamond-Like Carbon coating  
A DLC-finish will harden your timepiece, making it more resistant to shocks and scratches. The finish will also keep its polish or sheen no matter what kind of abuse you subject it to.

The Dials  
Custom matt carbon fiber dial with special smokes effect on the side.


Sapphire crystal 
We used only high quality, anti-reflective coating Sapphire Crystal (Front & caseback)





CURVED CASE DESIGN  
We opted for a 4 pm crown position, this design allows for your wrist to move and flex naturally without even the slightest abrasion. We custom made the case with a convex design for optimal fit and comfort in everyday wear.


Each watch case is meticulously constructed with the latest CNC technologies. It is then individually handcrafted to bring out the contrasting brushed surfaces.  
Deep concave dial rim with applied 3D indexes filled with superluminous.





Supreme Quality Miyota Automatic Skeleton Movement 8N40 with Small Second Running Time 42 Hours power reserve.  
A) WINDING THE MAINSPRING Automatic winding watch can also be hand winded by turning the crown clockwise in Normal position. Wind several times clockwise. It will start to move naturally.  
B) SETTING THE TIME  
1. Unscrew the crown and pull out to the 1st Click Position.  
2. Turn the crown to set hour and minute hands.    
3. After the time has been set, push the crown back and screwdown to the Normal position.


Case diameter : 42 mm  
Lug to lug : 52 mm  
Thickness : 13.5 mm  
Case Material : Grade 5 All titanium  
Caseback : Titanium with sapphire.  
Weight : 67 grams  
Bezel : Exchangeable skeleton case-sides  
Crown : Custom designed screwdown titanium  
Crystal : Sapphire crystal with AR coating

We do things differently. By using a disruptive, direct-to-consumer model we cut out distributors, wholesalers and retails stores. This way, by avoiding all the middlemen we can offer you a limited edition luxury sports skeleton watch for less than US$239.  
The Indiegogo prices are a one-time offer and are only possible because this is a pre-sale campaign. You are getting the watches practically at factory price. We, on the other hand, are able to finance production thanks to your pre-payment and make our new watch collection known on the international crowdfunding platform. A true win-win situation, don’t you think?  
The combination of the Indiegogo offer and the new concept has lead to a price that is almost revolutionary. Never have there been a watch made of such unique material at such a comparable price.

4 Styles Available  
We have 2 different models in this line of Scuro Volante :  

SV - 1 : Brushed titanium with red hands.    
SV - 4 : Black DLC with blue hands.

Each and every heated ti case has a different color effect.  
As a result, every single watch we have ever produced, and will ever produce, is entirely visually unique in it’s appearance, due to the variations of heated process.  
That means, even if you own two watches of the same model, there will still be visible differences between them – and forms a big part of what we consider to be the charm of owning a Volante S.E heated ti case.

<p>Hi Indiegogo! , I’m Belen Trivelli from Chile, and I will like to invite you all to take a ride through “Domado”.  </p>
<p>Since I was little, I was inspired by fashion and by the sport of horse racing. The combination of these two elements is how Domado was created.</p>
<p>I’ve been involved in this sport because family owns this kind of horses and they have transmitted this passion of betting, beauty, majesty and elegance of racing horses through a lot of generations. </p>
<p>All my life I’ve been surrounded by animals and I have a huge respect for them.</p>
<p>So I decided to create products based on horses, without making them suffer. That was my biggest challenge, making  each product 100% cruelty free respecting the life and freedom of horses.</p>

Hi Indiegogo! , I’m Belen Trivelli from Chile, and I will like to invite you all to take a ride through “Domado”.  
Since I was little, I was inspired by fashion and by the sport of horse racing. The combination of these two elements is how Domado was created.
I’ve been involved in this sport because family owns this kind of horses and they have transmitted this passion of betting, beauty, majesty and elegance of racing horses through a lot of generations. 
All my life I’ve been surrounded by animals and I have a huge respect for them.
So I decided to create products based on horses, without making them suffer. That was my biggest challenge, making  each product 100% cruelty free respecting the life and freedom of horses.


DOMADO

Domado is a chilean brand of exclusive handbags that use Horse Hair as the principal material for its confection.
I choose handbags, because I´m a believer that they are body complements, they have personality and speaks for themeselves, handbags give life to our body. 

PROCESS

comes all the process of cutting, selecting and washing the hair.

Por los palos is very versatile, it doesn’t matter if you use it as a shoulder,

If you have a Domado handbag you
will stand out from the crowd, not only for having an amazing design bag, but most

Historia
Hola, Indiegogo, soy Belen Trivelli de Chile, y los invito a todos a conocer Domado.
Desde que era pequeña, nació en mí
el amor por la moda y el deporte de la hípica. La combinación de estos dos
elementos es la base de como nace domado.
Me he visto envuelta en este
deporte ya que mi familia posee este tipo de caballos y nos han inculcado siempre  la
pasión por las apuestas, belleza, grandeza y elegancia  de los caballos de carrera por muchas
generaciones. 

Toda mi vida estuve rodeada por
animales y tengo un gran respeto hacia ellos. Es por eso que decidí crear

Domado

Domado es una marca chilena de carteras
exclusivas, que utiliza el crin de caballo como materia prima para su
confección. ¿Por que carteras? Porque soy una fiel creyente que las carteras son complementos de nuestro cuerpo, tienen personalidad al caminar y hablan por si solas, las carteras le dan vida a nuestro cuerpo.
Proceso

Las carteras de domado son sometidas a un largo proceso
de confección. Primero se encuentra toda la etapa de cortado, seleccionado y
lavado del pelo.
El lado creativo es la técnica conseguida después de una
larga investigación. Luego de muchas pruebas y error, nunca me di por vencida y
logre dominar la técnica que me permito crear los futuros productos. Esta técnica es la del fieltro, proceso que te permite crear planchas uniformes del material.
Te puedo asegurar que todos los
materiales que utiliza una cartera Domado son bien seleccionados y hecho a mano
por los mejores artesanos chilenos. 
Colección


Por los palos es la cartera mas pequeña que
te acompaña a dejar la rutina y salir con personalidad y elegancia. Este
concepto es utilizado en la hípica cuando el caballo y el jinete se abren del
grupo de carrera para ganar. Por los palos es una cartera muy
versátil, no importa si la ocupas tipo hombro, cruzada o clutch, tú eliges. 
Mensaje


Si tienes una cartera Domado vas a destacarte del resto no solo por tener un
maravilloso diseño si no por  apoyar a
los animales y su buen trato. 
El mensaje es muy simple, yo no soy una emprendedora, soy una mujer con visión, soy una generadora
de cambios, por lo tanto si tú crees en domado este es el minuto de apostar por
mí, apostar por los caballos, apostar por la vida.

Click the back this project button and help us make the Solid Titanium Fortitude Necklace a reality.</p><h3>Why I made Solid Titanium Fortitude Necklace</h3><p>One year after I was born, I was left to stay with my grandparents while my parents needed to struggle for life in another city. I could only see them once a year during the holidays. My mom gave me a necklace with a jade pendent when I was five, an age when kids started to know more about the world. The jade necklace was small and simple, but it meant the whole world to me. It had witnessed all my happiness, tears, struggle, weakness, fortitude and the TRUE side of me in the following years.</p><p>However, one day when I was a sophomore in high school I carelessly dropped it from my hands and it was broken into pieces. I was suddenly lost.  I remembered that jade necklace when reminiscing the bright and confident self with a strong heart. I really wanted to buy one that can last forever just to have for myself.

Click the back this project button and help us make the Solid Titanium Fortitude Necklace a reality.Why I made Solid Titanium Fortitude NecklaceOne year after I was born, I was left to stay with my grandparents while my parents needed to struggle for life in another city. I could only see them once a year during the holidays. My mom gave me a necklace with a jade pendent when I was five, an age when kids started to know more about the world. The jade necklace was small and simple, but it meant the whole world to me. It had witnessed all my happiness, tears, struggle, weakness, fortitude and the TRUE side of me in the following years.However, one day when I was a sophomore in high school I carelessly dropped it from my hands and it was broken into pieces. I was suddenly lost.  I remembered that jade necklace when reminiscing the bright and confident self with a strong heart. I really wanted to buy one that can last forever just to have for myself. But I couldn't find a durable, strong and affordable but simple jewel anywhere, so I determined to make one. I researched all of the main materials for making jewelries. Precious metals are pretty expensive and unaffordable for most people. Jade is easy to break. Regular metals are either allergic or corrode. After few weeks of research, I finally found the material I was looking for: Titanium, the strongest element and completely bio-compatible. In the following month, I read more about Titanium jewelry, visited manufacturers, and worked with manufacturers to solve all the challenges and focused on the concept of the necklace I want to make: Resolve to have more fortitude with the Necklace made of the strongest element in world! When the prototype was shipped to my office, my colleagues were immediately drawn to it. Everybody wanted to try it on. Here are what they said when they tried the necklace:""The design is so unique and distinctive. In some way, it's so straightforward and simple. I like the way it reflects solid lights from many different angles."" -- Ken""The solid Titanium necklace is so light, but with a solid feeling. It's so amazing! I can feel the strength it delivers to me!"" -- JoeNow, I'm wearing it everyday. We all have struggles in life, but this necklace represents my inner strength to overcome them. I believe it will help you to have more fortitude too.What is it about Titanium? Maybe it's the clean and straightforward color? Maybe it's the strongest element? Maybe we have some other connection to it? I'm not sure, I just know it's the thing people want to wear and touch the most.Pledge now and help us bring the Solid Titanium Fortitude Necklace to life!",18.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>TYNI WALLET</h3>
<p>A while back we launched our <a href=""http://bit.ly/tyniwallets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tyni Wallet campaign on Kickstarter</a> and it was a hit!

Now we are offering you, Indiegogo Backers to be the first to get your hands on the best slim wallet ever <strong>with or without RFID</strong>.</p>

<h3>HEADSTRUMENT is a wearable device that allows the user to “speak” / sing using music and sounds- <i>as their own voice.</i>
</h3>
<p>     HEADSTRUMENT works along with the natural acoustics of the human vocal tract- its special radiators safely transfer ANY sounds you choose<i> into your voicebox</i>; substituting the normal tone produced by vocal cords. You then ""whisper"" words; this adds diction and actual vocal expression (speech) to the sound! </p>
<p>     Imagine being able to create the sound of singing through the body of a violin, or talking like a guitar… “Robot Voice”? “Special Effects?” HUGE.<br/> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CopelNGjAfo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>     These are just a few examples;<i> any sound</i> can now be modified in this unique way. The variety of orchestral and synthesized tones is limitless, and we demonstrate many in our video (above). The video content was intentionally recorded WITHOUT any audio processing or effects; we wanted to showcase HEADSTRUMENT ""live""- and we're REALLY looking forward to see what our customers, artists and industry ""pros"" will be able to do! Acappella groups and choirs are gonna have a field day with this one.<br/> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Why Indiegogo</h3>
<p>     We’re going all the way with HEADSTRUMENT, and are very happy to have come so far this quickly. We have researched all our sources for components, manufacturing, packaging and continued support. Patent, Trademark, and Copyright devices are in place, distribution and marketing platforms are ready and waiting… now we’re here. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Musical instrument history keeps evolving, now there's this.</h3>
<p>     This is NOT software, or a gadget that processes and then reproduces your voice through a microphone &amp; speaker. All of the sounds emanate <i>from your MOUTH</i>; in real time, at full-room volume. No amplifier is required, nor any type of ""talkbox tube”; -this is completely different!</p>
<p>     HEADSTRUMENT is lightweight and wireless (USB capability, too). It fits comfortably around your neck, and it easily is taken off / put on (like a set of headphones).</p>
<p>     Simply pair any Bluetooth® enabled device with HEADSTRUMENT- and then have fun choosing whatever sound(s) you wish to say / sing. Select from our included sound library catalog; or easily create your own, too. A built-in memory bank also lets you have your FAVORITES ready ""on-the-fly"", perfect for live / improv applications.The bright LED lights flash and pulse in time with the sound –a built in light show! The versatility and “wow factor” is enormous- the initial response and feedback has been phenomenal. </p>
<p><strong><i>Medical / Therapy...</i></strong><br/>     Another BIG reason we are passionate about HEADSTRUMENT- the possible applications for helping layrngectomy patients or those with speech impediments (across the spectrum)  could very well be a game-changer. The typical ""electrolarynx device"" hasn't changed hardly at all for decades.  Again, this is<i> truly unique and different</i>. To realistically experiment and perform official, backed trials- is going to require money &amp; exposure of our product- two areas where social media, crowdfunding, and compassionate people will make that happen. Together, maybe we can help ""<strong>birds to sing again- or even for the<i> first time</i></strong>"". Please, deeply consider that aspect. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>     This invention is hard to sell, because it's hard to describe. However, once people ""get it"", it is evident the enormous impact that we could have- in a<i> variety of markets</i>. What an EASY way to make music, in a way that's unlike anything currently available! For now, know that a great deal has already been done to address the risks and challenges associated with this product, and its upcoming placement in the market. For sure, we'll be facing the usual things: availability of components, tooling and manufacturing, areas of improvement, lags from distribution, etc...-we're accounting for these and expecting them to a certain degree..</p>
<p>     The REAL challenge may be for unanticipated issues that could surface, however- we have redundancy and backup solutions in place; confident in allowing ALL of our steps the attention they merit during this process. Obviously, NOT clearing the [crowdfunding] goal will be the biggest ""risk"". </p>
<p><br/>     The funding from this campaign solidifies the completed reality of and continuing dedication towards this exciting invention. Of course, we will consistently maintain transparency and communication with you, the backers, and our expanding online community- now and in the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Pledge, like and please share...</h3>
<p>It's a fact: ALL contributions get us closer to clearing our minimum and busting through the finish line, <i>first</i>. If everyone who sees this campaign donates ONE DOLLAR; we will easily achieve that strong finish! If you believe in the product- and you dig it is much as we do, let your friends and online community know about it. This is a group effort- we thank you for reading this far and checking it out- please help spread the word- 60 days is plenty of time...<i> if</i> enough people know about it!</p>

<h2>What makes this wallet different?</h2>
<h3>Customizable</h3>
<p>With an assortment of vibrant colors and a selection of unique Alto designs, there are over a thousand different wallets possible.  But we didn’t want to stop there!  To be truly customizable we had to give the power to the people.  We are offering a limited reward level that allows you to express yourself to the world, and carry your most personal possessions in something truly unique to you.  With your help, we can streamline this process and offer it as an option to everyone in the future!</p>
<p>Since our wallets are made to look amazing, we needed to innovate a way to create this wallet without covering it up.  What’s the point of a customizable wallet if you can’t see it!</p>
<p><img alt=""Side by Side Comparison"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/192402_292952537472313_249243372_o.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Side by Side""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>Adaptable Capacity</h3>
<p>The Alto Wallet gives you the ability to carry everything you want, and in an instant, carry only what you need.  If you start with a typical slim wallet, the instant you push its capacity to the limits you are often making a permanent decision.  Your wallet is now stuck since you’ve stretched all the pockets to double their intended size. </p>
<p>The Alto Wallet makes the most out of its minimal design by providing you complete control over exactly what you’re carrying.  Finally you have the freedom to switch between minimal and not so minimal, in a matter of seconds.  The Alto Wallet can adapt to any situation; whether you’re going out for a jog, or going out to a club, this wallet adapts to you and your lifestyle.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Fits Your Life</h3>
<p>The Alto Wallet has been carefully refined; it’s thin, light, flexible, and highly durable.  It’s no coincidence these features are identical to credit cards, cash, and most anything else you put in your wallet.  You can see below that the contents of a wallet can outweigh the wallet itself.  These features make it legitimately comfortable to sit on and also make it perfect for sports like snowboarding, skiing, longboarding and more.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Keeps You Organized</h3>
<p>The Alto Wallet provides several ways to keep your essentials safe and organized.  The main compartment was designed to be easily accessible and allow you to see everything in your wallet at a glance.  Efficiently select items from your wallet by manipulating your cards like you would folders in a filing cabinet.   </p>
<p><img alt=""Main Compartment"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/679966_292949110805989_1285947668_o.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Main Compartment""/></p>
<p>The inner compartment enables you to keep things separate from the main compartment.  The band is perfectly sized to tightly store one or multiple cards.  This makes it convenient to store your most used card(s), or your least used card(s).  This wallet gives you the freedom to use it how you want, and to change as often as you like.</p>
<p><img alt=""Inner Compartment"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-f.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/201143_292949100805990_1917782071_o.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Inner Compartment""/></p>
<p>The last compartment is on the outside of the wallet, which provides extremely easy access and storage.  Perfect for short term items like receipts, movie tickets, plane tickets, business cards, etc. The band is secure and will hold items in place wherever your wallet goes.</p>
<p><img alt=""Outer Compartment"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/664329_292949130805987_1927079592_o.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Outer Compartment""/></p>

<h3>Versatile</h3>
<p>There are more ways to use the Alto Wallet than we can show, but here are a few examples.  These features and more, make this wallet a dream for the jet setter or backpacking traveler.  The wallet’s functional yet minimal design will continually impress you with its versatility.  Experience the world with a wallet that won’t hold you back. </p>

<h3>Behind the Design</h3>
<p>Over a year and a half ago, we challenged ourselves to create the perfect longboard.  With little more than a bandsaw, contractor’s table saw, and some other basic power tools, we began this impossible journey.  Obsessively devoting ourselves, we created a longboard in our own vision and after several months this vision started to come into focus.  It took several more months until we achieved a design we were truly satisfied with.  This turned out to be an important lesson for us; the knowledge that anything is possible with enough hard work and perseverance.  Comparing our first longboards to the ones we create now, it’s obvious to see how far we’ve come.</p>
<p>Building by hand and starting from scratch meant we had complete control over the functionality and design of our longboards.  However, this also meant we would generate a considerable amount of waste.  As our longboards got better, so did our woodworking skills and soon we were able to find ways to put our scrap material to good use; creating unique cutting boards, trays, and coasters.  We inevitably began challenging more complex projects, like a wallet made from handcrafted wood and carbon fiber.</p>
<p>The feedback we received from our early prototypes was quite positive but also a bit of an eye opener.  Turns out lots of people disliked their wallets as much as we did.  Realizing we had an opportunity to make people lives better, we decided to ramp up prototyping and take this design challenge head on.</p>
<p>The Alto Wallet was created with a ridiculous amount of perseverance, attention to detail, and belief in ourselves to create a better wallet… in a world full of wallets.  We don’t take short cuts, we don’t sacrifice quality, and invariably this means we are always choosing to do things the hard way.  Based on all our past experiences, we have seen that challenging ourselves is often the best way to create something entirely new.</p></div>","New Wood Wallets Available NOW!

Our Mission
Pride & Honor Clothing Company is a veteran owned business that provides high quality clothing and apparel for veterans and patriots. Pride & Honor currently donates $1 from all orders to the Wounded Warrior Project and other charities. 
We decided to try our luck with IndieGoGo to try and get funding to give our business an extra push in the right direction so that we can continue to provide outstanding products and give back to the war fighter community. 
With your help, we will be able to take control of our shirt production and keep it all in house. This will allow us to continue to offer great products and give us the flexibility to offer custom shirt products to military units, charities, public service departments, etc.
Below are the first of our unreleased signature series shirts.

The Impact
In addition to building the P&H brand, having our own production equipment will also let us get back to helping families of the fallen and war fighters and public service officers who have been injured in the line of duty through the revival of our t-shirt drives in which all proceeds are donated to the service member or their family. 
With our new equipment we also plan on creating custom shirts for other military units, police departments, fire departments, charities, etc. Below is an example of shirts we have done in the past.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise $13,000 USD to purchase our own t-shirt printing/silk-screen equipment and supplies allowing us to take control over the production of our shirts. This crucial step will allow us to continue to build our business and better serve our customers by bringing our costs down and passing those savings on to our customers. 
With these funds and cost savings we will continue to build our brand as well by releasing 3-5 unseen shirt designs. 
You can see a list of our perks at the right. The ammounts range from $25 - $500. Please help us out if you can.  
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We know it is impossible for some to help out as money may be tight. If it weren't, we probably would not be here looking for help either. So if you cannot contribute I ask that you please share this with your friends and family to help get the word out so that we can meet our goals. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this and to consider our project.

<p><strong>What is Life is People?</strong><br/><br/>Life is People is a people project using visual arts &amp; media to encourage, inspire &amp; embrace the beauty &amp; value of every individual, by capturing it &amp; allowing them to experience it.<br/><br/>You may see the project for yourself by visiting: <a href=""http://lifeispeople.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://lifeispeople.com</a><br/><br/><br/><strong>Why Donate?</strong><br/><br/>We launched the project on Nov. 07 (11-07-11) making our first initial push with a fully functioning website as well as a small run of tees to help provide some financial backing. We hope to raise enough money with this apparel campaign to create a self-sustaining resource which will then help us properly fund the equipment we need and get it our idea on the road. By taking our idea on the road it grants the opportunity to have a nationwide impact rather than just locally.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Where Will The Money Go?</strong><br/><br/>Your contributions will go towards funding the incentives from this campaign and the design and production of a line of Summer apparel for the Life is People project through Released Clothing.

We hope to raise enough money with this apparel campaign to create a self-sustaining resource which will then help us properly fund the equipment we need and get it our idea on the road. By taking our idea on the road it grants the opportunity to have a nationwide impact rather than just locally.Where Will The Money Go?Your contributions will go towards funding the incentives from this campaign and the design and production of a line of Summer apparel for the Life is People project through Released Clothing.

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Axel Grivory. I was born in Paris, France, and as far I can remember, I have always been passionate about creation, design, and all kinds of objects and accessories.</p>
<p>Although I was born in Paris, I grew up in a multicultural context. After my high school degree, I attended a French-American business school, graduated from a Master degree in Luxury brand management, and joined the family business working as Area Manager in the perfume industry.</p>
<p>After 15 years of career, I wanted to tackle a new challenge and started an 18 month  Executive MBA program. It convinced me to start my own company. Having my own watch brand would no longer be only a dream. I would turn my experience of travelling the world in designing fine watches.</p>
<p>I made a rough sketch showing the main lines of the design I had in mind.</p>
<p>The next stage was to find the right development studio that would turn my drawing into a technically designed 3D rendering, including all the features of a fine Swiss-made timepiece.</p>
<p>Of course, I needed a <a href=""https://www.springeretfersen.fr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, a Community Management, budgets for communication and production, as well as access to the market.</p>
<p>At that point, crowdfunding appeared to be THE solution to all these needs.</p>
<p>I ran a Kickstarter campaign and successfully managed to gather the 25000 € to get started.</p>
<p>That is only a first step, and I now need the support of the Indiegogo community to help me achieve my dream and keep designing more extraordinary watches inspired by the beauty of the world.</p>
<p>That is the real DNA of SPRINGER &amp; FERSEN, sharing with you my experience through compelling designs and watchmaking excellence.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to a past successful campaign, we could develop our first watch, make prototypes and launch our website.</p>
<p>In order to further develop the brand, we need to gather about 160 000€. </p>
<p>The price of a Rangiroa World Diver (RWD) includes:</p>
<p>- The watch kit (bracelet, case, crowns, bezel, etc.)</p>
<p>- The movement (SwissTech S24045)</p>
<p>- The watch box (lacquered wood)</p>
<p>- A 2-years International Guaranty card</p>
<p>- and, the Springer &amp; Fersen The club membership card.</p>
<p>Any additional money will be reinjected in the company to develop a new model, develop a retail network, and why not start developing an in-house movement!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting us, you will have on your wrist the testimony of the success you contributed to building, embodied in a unique original designed swiss-made luxury watch.</p>
<p>Moreover, you will contribute to free the creativity in a field (unfortunately)  dominated by group company mass-produced standardised pieces.</p>
<p>Also, you will enter a club dedicated to discovering the world and its beauty through an original watch concept.</p>
<p>Besides, translating the world's beauty into the lines of a mechanical watch is also a tribute to the majesty of nature, its force but also its fragility. And if you think of it, what is eco-friendlier than a mechanical watch? If you take care of it, it is almost immortal, no need to change the batteries, nearly no impact on the environment beyond the initial production.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our goal is to build a sustainable watch brand, able to face the trials of time. To achieve that, we need the help of the Indiegogo community so that the dream does not stop at the Rangiroa World Diver.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, the main help I am looking for is money. However, not everybody can afford such amount of money, and you may very well want to help us although our product is not matching your style. If you like our adventure, still cannot buy the watch, tell everyone else you know a marvellous piece of design has appeared and that they have a chance to have it on their wrist.</p>
<p>And if among you, some are distributors, commercial agent or have ways of helping in selling our watches, we will, of course, be grateful the support you could have granted us!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">RANGIROA WORLD DIVER</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The story behind the watch<br/> </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The story of this watch begins in January 2009, when with my friends we decided to discover French Polynesia and Rangiroa in particular for about two weeks.</p>
<p>One day, part of the group decided to stay at the village and chill out, and the other part of the group, myself included, decided to go to the Blue Lagoon and swim with myriads of inoffensive small sharks. So we called a taxi boat, customary there, and set sails (or rather engines) to the Blue Lagoon, on the other side of the Rangiroa atoll.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577790314/pxfdpzt7awkg62hdb5vg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>On our way to the Blue Lagoon</i></p>
<p>On our way there, we were in for a treat: we saw sea turtles, manta rays, colourful fishes coming to the shallow waters to reproduce... and we spent half the day there. In the middle of the afternoon, we realised we had missed our taxi boat and that we were stranded on this isolated part of the atoll. The sun was starting to set, and we had no way to communicate our location to anyone.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw a fisherman passing by with his boat and signalled him our presence. He came to our rescue and accepted to take us back to the village. Little did we know he was not coming back from fishing but rather from partying on a motu (small flat island made of coral sand) nearby and had a few too many drinks. On our way back we got lost in the dark - of course, it had to be a moonless night-, the boat engine broke, and the fisherman spent the time singing and shouting ""I am the Captain of the vessel!"" at the top of his lungs. As for us,  we were part laughing, part anxious, part downright scared because we didn't know if our ""Captain"" was indeed able to take us back to safety.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an infinity, with the only noises surrounding us the clapping of the water caused by fishes hunting and fighting, we finally reached the village where the part of our group who had stayed had organised a welcoming party and set a fire on the beach to try to guide us home.</p>
<p>That day certainly is the day that made me realise the power of the elements, its beauty and its mysteries and although it was a hard time living it, it remains probably one of my fondest memories from those holidays.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>RANGIROA WORLD DIVER in the making<br/> </h3>
<p>When I had to choose the first destination for SPRINGER &amp; FERSEN, that day and the wonders we experienced came to my mind. The first stop on this world tour would be Rangiroa, famous for its diving spots. And naturally, it had to be a diver watch.</p>
<p>And so RANGIROA WORLD DIVER was born: out of passion, work and will to share with you the world, and the beauties I see in it.</p>

This finish gives the watch a tough, durable coating that will shrug off the majority of knocks during the rigours of duty.The 316L stainless steel used surpasses marine grade, so has all of the anti-oxide properties you would expect whilst remaining tough and light, resulting in a solid and substantial timepiece.Following on from numerous prototypes, we decided to move away from the conventional twist lock case back, favouring the much higher end finish of a micro-screw lock case. This provides a superior waterproof seal and allows every watch to be perfectly aligned.We have built our watch to the toughest specifications we can accomplish, therefore the Patrolman Enforcer is designed to handle being scratched, battered and used relentlessly.WATCH BEZELThe Patrolman Enforcer features sapphire crystal, making the watch face almost unscratchable in action and compares favourably to anything you’ll find on a digital or high street quartz watch.The 316L stainless watch bezel protects the Sapphire glass by giving the crystal a recessed, protective lip all the way around.

It's protected by smooth case contours, resulting in a more comfortable day to day wear whilst offering extra resilience to the crown in the event of the watch being dropped.The watch has a water resilience of 10 ATM (100m water resistant), making the Patrolman Enforcer ideal for recreational activities or light water work.THE MODELFor the Indiegogo campaign, we have decided to re-release the White & Blue version of the Patrolman Enforcer. This has proven to be fantastically popular choice and provides the best all round visibility for on and off duty wear.For our Kickstarter campaign we ran with two models, but such was the popularity in White & Blue, that we have decided to offer this as an extension Indiegogo campaign.*Any 'Solid Blue' model images are just for illustration purposes and not being offered as a selection during this campaign.*We have demonstrated a side by side comparison of the W&B Enforcer watch in both daylight and night conditions.  C3 SuperLuminova is applied to the majority of the watch dial and hands but due to the lume value degrading when mixed with colour, pure white is the most vivid area.MOVEMENTAs avid watch collectors, we know the draw of a good automatic watch.

Since this time we have received a large amount of pre-sales through our website www.Patrolmanwatches.comWe are prepared for the increased production and are in a fortunate position of being able to take on additional pre-sales through Indiegogo.The Patrolman Enforcer was designed in the UK but is being manufactured in China, by the same manufacturer used by several well-known watch companies. The watches take several months to manufacture, as you might expect of a totally custom timepiece, but we will keep you updated all the way, right up to delivery at your door in April 2018.The timeline we've put together factors in Chinese holidays as well as allowing for unexpected delays. Throughout the manufacturing and quality control phases, we will keep all backers updated here as well as on our Facebook page.We can also be closely followed via our Instagram and Twitter pages so please do follow us for regular updates.WATCH TESTING AND COMPLIANCEWhile we wanted to deliver an affordable piece, we were also laser focussed on the quality of the materials and finish. We have made sure that all of our watches meet the strict EU compliance standards.WARRANTYEvery Patrolman Enforcer watch comes with a 12 month warranty against manufacturing or movement defects.The watches are all individually inspected prior to shipping out to you, but if for any reason the watch you receive has a manufacturing defect that has gone unnoticed, we will repair or replace the watch for you.SHIPPING- WORLDWIDE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPINGThe Patrolman Enforcer is aimed at Law Enforcement Officers all around the world, we therefore will ship worldwide.When backing the project, you'll be asked where in the world you'd like your watch shipped to and the appropriate fee will be added to your pledge. We'll contact you when the project funds to get your address.SHIPS FROM THE UKThe Patrolman Enforcer ships from the UK via courier to anywhere worldwide. If you're outside the EU, you'll need to confirm any import duties you may be required to pay with your local customs office.Funding period30 days After this time all watches will be sold at the expected retail price of £185 GBP($243 USD/ €210 EUR) via on our website: www.patrolmanwatches.comRisks and challengesWe have taken every precaution to ensure that we can deliver on schedule.Following extensive tests with numerous manufacturers and countless prototypes, we found a manufacturer who impressed us hugely with their decades of experience in manufacturing watches for a number of high end watch companies.We have worked with our chosen factory on rounds of prototypes and each have been delivered on time and to the correct specification.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">Hello Indiegogo Friends and Pura Vida!</span></strong></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For the past 6 years <a href=""http://www.gg2g.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s2"">GG2g</span></a>, which is located in Milford, Connecticut, has been successful at making handbags and accessories from a variety of recycled, animal-free materials. At the height of the business we were in over 150 stores! But significant business interruptions with contract manufacturers had a major impact on our company’s operations. At that point we decided to try to turn our problem into a positive! With orders still coming in we made a (painful) choice to stop all production, try to resolve our manufacturing issues, while continuing to develop our product lines. </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">As fate would have it, in 2012 I was given the opportunity to participate in a Women's Empowerment Fellowship Program through the U.S. State Department, the University of Connecticut and the <a href=""http://www.upeace.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s2"">University for Peace</span></a>, Costa Rica. Through the fellowship process, I met my counterpart (and soul sister), Natascha Moscoa (founder of <span class=""s2""><a href=""http://hipnverdecostarica.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HipN’Verde</a>)</span> in Costa Rica, and a shared vision was discovered.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">By working together we realized we could change the lives of women in under served-populations and a new idea was born. Natascha already had an established group of women to sew her line of fabulous eco-friendly handbags but had the opposite issue that we did - People to sew, but few orders coming in. The lightbulb goes on! </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">It was an epiphany; we would join our companies and focus on 360 degrees of sustainability by establishing a social enterprise to further our already Green mission!</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We saw an opportunity not only to continue on with sustainability, but to weave into our mission the elements of caring and compassion, which would benefit women in underserved populations!</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">To make both the sourcing and sale of our bags include caring and compassion, we also made a decision to donate a portion of our retail sales proceeds to <a href=""http://www.farmsanctuary.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Farm Sanctuary"">Farm Sanctuary</a>, who work to end cruelty to farm animals and promote compassionate living through rescue, education and advocacy.  </p>
<p><strong>Miss Manos </strong>- We have chosen the name carefully, with one word in English and one word in Spanish. ""Miss"" being a respectful nod to the feminine, and ""Manos"" the Spanish word for hands. We felt it important that the name reflect our cross cultural, dignity building and artisan made endevour.</p>

<h3 class=""p4""><strong>The Sewing Studios:</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Our initial idea was to bring everyone together under one roof but as I have just learned on my recent trip, Costa Rica is a very family oriented society and it is very common to have 3 - 4 generations living under one roof which means that there is always someone needing care within the home. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For rural women in Costa Rica, it is therefore best for each woman to work primarily from her home, and have a central sewing studio with specialized sewing machines and a meeting room. </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">When a woman is working from home, she is free to tend to her family's needs and sew when it fits in her daily schedule.</p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We will use the funds to update each woman's sewing studios.

In the moment there are four women who each have an industrial sewing machine in their home (donated by a German NGO, Futouris), each machine is in need of repair and a tune-up. We need to purchase 3 speciality machines that are used for sewing handbags and we need to move an initial cache of salvaged fabrics from one point to another. We also need a little start up money for new tags, and postcards, and to buy some lining fabrics and hardware. If you are someone who likes details here is an itemized list:</span></p>

Sewing the Seeds of dignity and independence.

Our Mission: Empowering women and improving their quality of life through a shared initiative. A fair-wage sewing venture that creates beautiful eco and animal friendly handbags and accessories. 

Learning some new techniques

Hello Indiegogo Friends and Pura Vida!
For the past 6 years GG2g, which is located in Milford, Connecticut, has been successful at making handbags and accessories from a variety of recycled, animal-free materials. At the height of the business we were in over 150 stores! But significant business interruptions with contract manufacturers had a major impact on our company’s operations. At that point we decided to try to turn our problem into a positive! With orders still coming in we made a (painful) choice to stop all production, try to resolve our manufacturing issues, while continuing to develop our product lines. 
As fate would have it, in 2012 I was given the opportunity to participate in a Women's Empowerment Fellowship Program through the U.S. State Department, the University of Connecticut and the University for Peace, Costa Rica. Through the fellowship process, I met my counterpart (and soul sister), Natascha Moscoa (founder of HipN’Verde) in Costa Rica, and a shared vision was discovered.
By working together we realized we could change the lives of women in under served-populations and a new idea was born. Natascha already had an established group of women to sew her line of fabulous eco-friendly handbags but had the opposite issue that we did - People to sew, but few orders coming in. The lightbulb goes on! 
It was an epiphany; we would join our companies and focus on 360 degrees of sustainability by establishing a social enterprise to further our already Green mission!
We saw an opportunity not only to continue on with sustainability, but to weave into our mission the elements of caring and compassion, which would benefit women in underserved populations!
To make both the sourcing and sale of our bags include caring and compassion, we also made a decision to donate a portion of our retail sales proceeds to Farm Sanctuary, who work to end cruelty to farm animals and promote compassionate living through rescue, education and advocacy.  
Miss Manos - We have chosen the name carefully, with one word in English and one word in Spanish. ""Miss"" being a respectful nod to the feminine, and ""Manos"" the Spanish word for hands. We felt it important that the name reflect our cross cultural, dignity building and artisan made endevour.

Risks and challenges
We know that there will be challenges along the way but we have a wonderful team of positive-minded women. We can meet our challenges head on. 
Since we will be shipping from Costa Rica to the U.S. and Europe, we know that we have some learning to do regarding import/export regulations. At this time I'm working with an import broker to figure out the best way to handle any situation that may arise.
On a very positive note the U.S and Costa Rica share a very amicable relationship and trade is encouraged. 
We anticipate some delays in shipping in the first few months of production and will allow for that by 1) Giving our clients a realistic expectation regarding delivery date 2) Allowing for time delays in our own estimated deadlines.
The U.S. and Costa Rica have different methods of doing business and cultural differences, but we feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn about and address those differences through a course at the University for Peace in San Jose. 
We also feel confident that should any unanticipated problems arise that we have the support of family, coworkers, peers and a myriad of knowledge at our fingertips through the amazing women from our Fellowship. 
Natascha and I are seasoned professional with a shared goal. We feel that our commitment and drive will carry us through any rough patch we may encounter.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>The 1Decision Bracelet is A real-time Child safety bracelet for parents and children of all ages.  </b>It is the first and only complete end-to-end family real time alert Device which will alert you the second that your child is out of the range of the bracelet.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">It’s size is adjustable to fit any wrist, with beautiful design and colors. The 1Decision Bracelets connects to each other using RF technology, alerting you with a silent vibration the second that your child is out of range. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">While designing the 1Decision Bracelet we wanted to create a fashionable product that will seamlessly blend into your everyday life.</p>
<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;"">WHY? </h1>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Just imagine how many times you have been so busy. It could be your day job, housekeeping, daily chores, Social networking and even the kids. It can happen to the best of us. It only takes one second to get distracted. Unfortunately sometimes the consequences of getting that distracted can be severe. You might leave your child in a car, lose them in a crowded place, or be the victim of something much more serious such as child-kidnapping. It is a nightmare situation for any parent.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>So How Does It Work?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Let's imagine for a moment that you are on your phone talking to a friend or your boss, While you're distracted by the conversation - your child wanders off and is completely out of your range. Within 10-15 minutes of this happening it could already be too late. This scenario would not happen with the <b>1Decision </b>Bracelet! The moment that your child wanders out of range, </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">* The range can be set by the parent  to 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 or 50 meters radius.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Your Bracelet will vibrate, alerting you On time! You don’t need you smartphone to connect to it or any additional Apps,You don't need WiFi or 3G on.</p>

1Decision Bracelet - It's All about saving lives

What is the 1Decision Bracelet?
The 1Decision Bracelet is A real-time Child safety bracelet for parents and children of all ages.  It is the first and only complete end-to-end family real time alert Device which will alert you the second that your child is out of the range of the bracelet.
It’s size is adjustable to fit any wrist, with beautiful design and colors. The 1Decision Bracelets connects to each other using RF technology, alerting you with a silent vibration the second that your child is out of range. 
While designing the 1Decision Bracelet we wanted to create a fashionable product that will seamlessly blend into your everyday life.
WHY? 
Just imagine how many times you have been so busy. It could be your day job, housekeeping, daily chores, Social networking and even the kids. It can happen to the best of us. It only takes one second to get distracted. Unfortunately sometimes the consequences of getting that distracted can be severe. You might leave your child in a car, lose them in a crowded place, or be the victim of something much more serious such as child-kidnapping. It is a nightmare situation for any parent.


The 1Decision bracelet aims to change all of that. It uses reliable and safe RF technology, similar to what is found in many devices as different remote controls (Medical devices, Cars, Toys, and even your TV remote)
So How Does It Work?
Let's imagine for a moment that you are on your phone talking to a friend or your boss, While you're distracted by the conversation - your child wanders off and is completely out of your range. Within 10-15 minutes of this happening it could already be too late. This scenario would not happen with the 1Decision Bracelet! The moment that your child wanders out of range, 
* The range can be set by the parent  to 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 or 50 meters radius.
Your Bracelet will vibrate, alerting you On time! You don’t need you smartphone to connect to it or any additional Apps,You don't need WiFi or 3G on.
This is what makes this 1Decision Bracelet absolutely priceless.




What makes the 1Decision Bracelet different?The 1Decision is a unique product. you will find nothing else quite like it on the market today:
• It is the first and only complete, end-to-end, family real-time alert device that alerts you the second that your child is out of range.
• The 1Decision Bracelet does not rely on any other devices, smartphones or apps  (!!!) So there is no delay in receiving an alert.
•	The 1Decision bracelet was designed to be comfortable and fashionable for both kids and parents. You will hardly know it's there. 

•	The 1Decision bracelet has a unique option that enable you to set the desired range between you and your child.

•	Comes in a range of trendy designs and colors It is designed to fit properly and comfortably on both yours and your child’s wrists, and is highly convenient.
• Not requiring any additional hardware or apps also means no WiFi or Apps downloads required for it to work, does not need to rely on a thing but the other bracelet.
•	Cost effective, less than half the price of any similar product.
The 1Decision Bracelet set consists of 2 bracelets. One for you and One for your child. These bracelets remain connected wirelessly using RF technology. This allows parents to be connected to their child with no leash on their back and without worrying that the child would disappear in couple of seconds.
*The technology we are using allows to connect one or more parent bracelet to several child bracelets.In case  you have more than one child or if you would like more than 1 parent bracelet you can easily order as many additional child / parent bracelets as you like.




Everyone thinks to themselves: “This will not happen to me.”, unfortunately, the truth is that it can happen to everyone, even to to the best and most responsible parents.  
The Beginning of 1Decision:
We have started this project by developing RF chips that can be paired with each other and send/receive RF signals. Then, we have succeeded to set the RF chip to alert when the other RF device was out of range.






Your help:

We believe that it is very important to keep the price of each Bracelet as low as possible, so you can keep your children safe. We have been talking to many different manufacturers all over the world and the only way we can effectively keep the price of the units down is by purchasing many components (RF chips, boards etc..). This inventory requirement is the single biggest reason we need your help. Help us save lives.


Risks and challenges

1Decision has already developed a Prototype of Two Bracelets that works perfectly.

Currently, we are using several different RF devices with different fixed ranges (imposed by the industry) and attempting to find a happy compromise between the different ranges. We have are currently designing a custom RF inlay for this Bracelet So it could be adjusted to every parent needs (larger/smaller ranges). 
Because Children are going to use the bracelets and since we are aware to the fact that children can be messy - We aim to create the Bracelet Water resistant so could be used without a need to worry about a thing.   
You can be sure that 1Decision Bracelet will work all the Time.

Question:
Do I need to use an app or handle any kind of programming/configurations in
order to use the bracelet?
Answer:
 No. the use of the 1Decision bracelet does not require any additional apps or
special configurations and does not rely on your phone being next to you with sufficient
buttery or anything like that. Everything can be set directly from the parent’s
bracelet and it is super easy to use!

What sort of material is the bracelet made out of? 
Answer:
 The 1Decision bracelet is made of highly resistant silicone.

_________________________________________________________________________

Question:
 Does it have user replaceable batteries?
How long does each battery charge
last, and how do we know when the battery runs low? 

Answer: 
The buttery can hold between 48 to 72 hours of connection
than, they can be recharged using the 1Decision’s bracelet charger.
The 1Decision bracelet has a red
led light to indicate when the battery runs low.

Question:
How can I be sure that my child won’t take it off?
Answer:
Actually
that’s one of the main things we had in mind when designing the 1Decision
bracelet. The bracelet is designed with a special band that makes it difficult to
be taken off unless you know how to.",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We have become used to tracking our daily steps, weight loss, and sleeping hours, but we have forgotten to follow the most precious thing: </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">our time.</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Motivational speaker Jim Rohn famously said that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. How about starting to track the time you spend with the people around you?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever heard: “<b>You don’t spend enough time with me</b>”? Or have you ever said to someone, “<b>I would like to spend more time with you</b>”? But how can we keep track? What is “enough”, and what is “more”? Of course, we can pick up a pencil and paper and start calculating the time in an old-school way…. Umm, thanks but no thanks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s why we created Soul. Soul is a completely new concept of tracking that redefines the meaning of time. Soul is both an App and a stylish Sensor that helps track and share moments with our soulmates because we believe that every minute counts!</p>

<p>One night while inventing our new gadgets that help people make their pictures perfectly Instagrammable, we had this crazy conversation: How much time do we spend with each other? How much time do we spend with our family members? Soulmates? Best friends? Old friends? Loved ones? Where would we rather be now?</p>

It’s not about productivity, efficiency, focusing, speeding up, slowing down, or even leaving the comfort zone. </p>This is not something you can learn from self-improvement books.

<p><span>Concepter Soul is both an App and Sensor (band or keychain). They work together to detect other Souls, e.g. Soul apps on smartphones (this is free and always will be, yay!). Also, it can detect Soul Sensors on keychains or wristbands (get one of them right now for your own pleasure or as an unusual gift idea for any occasion. You’re welcome!). When people come within 15 feet of one another, apps or gadgets sync automatically, and begin tracking the total time being spent together. Soul Sensor delivers this information to an app. It only takes a minute to revise the time reports.</span></p>

<p><span>Soul Sensor is a  tiny, stylish <b>keychain or wristband</b> that provides accurate information on time tracking, saves smartphone battery life, and suits as a great gift. The Soul App uses the GPS location of your phone which can be inaccurate sometimes. For example, it does not take into account different floors of the building, and can count the time in one spot (geographically) as time spent together. This does not happen to a Soul Sensor. If your phone is discharged, you are moving too fast or your smartphone does not have a proper GPS connection. In this case, Soul Sensor could be a very handy tool.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Both the Soul Sensor and an App work 24/7 and activate automatically when Soul devices are detected within the radius. You don't need to turn on/off Sensor or start tracking activity manually.</p>

<p><span>A: You can adjust your the Perk you have chosen and add additional $35 to your reward. We will recognise that as an additional Soul and will add it to your shipment.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Why would anyone prefer to use Sensor instead of tracking time with the App only? I mean, what functionality does the wearable provide compared to an App?</b></p>
<p>A: Smartphone tracks time via GPS, which is more of guessing time, rather than of actually tracking it. Smartphones don’t take into account different floors of the building, and is not good at tracking while you move. While the Sensor shows the actual time you've spent with others.</p>
<br/><p><b>Q: I wish it had a display, could inform about the time and be able to perform some other smart features, like receiving phone notifications and such!</b></p>
<p>A: We decided to keep it simple, stylish and inexpensive. The goal of the product is to motivate spend more time with people and less time with gadgets, that's why we don't want to distract you with display or notifications, like any other wearable.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: Does everybody need the Sensor and/or an App to track time spent together? Some people might not be into this kind of stuff or aren't tech-savvy, but it would be lovely to track time with them somehow. Will you enable manual inputs?</b></p>
<p>A: We’ve built a fully automatic time tracking system. That is why you need to add other people in the App as friends - it’s easy because we can sync with your Facebook or phone contacts.</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have become used to tracking our daily steps, weight loss, and sleeping hours, but we have forgotten to follow the most precious thing: our time. Motivational speaker Jim Rohn famously said that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. How about starting to track the time you spend with the people around you?

Have you ever heard: “You don’t spend enough time with me”? Or have you ever said to someone, “I would like to spend more time with you”? But how can we keep track? What is “enough”, and what is “more”? Of course, we can pick up a pencil and paper and start calculating the time in an old-school way…. Umm, thanks but no thanks.

That’s why we created Soul. Soul is a completely new concept of tracking that redefines the meaning of time. Soul is both an App and a stylish Sensor that helps track and share moments with our soulmates because we believe that every minute counts!








Here in Concepter, we work a lot and we love what we do. It takes a lot of time to create, test, and produce our amazing products. Sometimes we even forget to eat or sleep or eat again. And especially to have Netflix and chill with our #bae, #bf, #bff, #bestie, or #bro’s.

One night while inventing our new gadgets that help people make their pictures perfectly Instagrammable, we had this crazy conversation: How much time do we spend with each other? How much time do we spend with our family members? Soulmates? Best friends? Old friends? Loved ones? Where would we rather be now?
And the most important one: Should we create a tool that can count time even if nobody gets more than 24 hours per day?
Yup.
Please welcome the world’s first tracker that encourages you not to meet the deadline, but to meet the loved one.










  
We have already premiered the Soul concept and prototypes at the biggest consumer electronic show in Las Vegas earlier this year and received a warm feedback from the world's best media and industry experts. We also received a Best of CES 2016 nomination by Engadget as a Best Offbeat Product. Flattered.







Our main goal is to motivate people to have more personal time together instead of mindlessly switching from one task to another all day long. It’s not about productivity, efficiency, focusing, speeding up, slowing down, or even leaving the comfort zone. This is not something you can learn from self-improvement books. This is about spending time with the important people in our lives. What can make us happier than a friendship stronger than your home wi-fi signal?

Concepter Soul is both an App and Sensor (band or keychain). They work together to detect other Souls, e.g. Soul apps on smartphones (this is free and always will be, yay!). Also, it can detect Soul Sensors on keychains or wristbands (get one of them right now for your own pleasure or as an unusual gift idea for any occasion. You’re welcome!). When people come within 15 feet of one another, apps or gadgets sync automatically, and begin tracking the total time being spent together. Soul Sensor delivers this information to an app. It only takes a minute to revise the time reports.



Soul has a free supporting application for iOS that allows users to connect with Facebook friends, track time spent together, challenge each other on leveling up their friendship (the more time you spend together, the higher level you achieve), and provides various analytics on time spent with other people. Soul does not track time with other people while sleeping. We’ve built our automatic sleep tracking method similar to other sleep tracking apps. Our Android version will be available on Google Play in June 2016.




 
Our Android version will be available on Google Play in June 2016.








Soul Sensor is a  tiny, stylish keychain or wristband that provides accurate information on time tracking, saves smartphone battery life, and suits as a great gift. The Soul App uses the GPS location of your phone which can be inaccurate sometimes. For example, it does not take into account different floors of the building, and can count the time in one spot (geographically) as time spent together. This does not happen to a Soul Sensor. If your phone is discharged, you are moving too fast or your smartphone does not have a proper GPS connection. In this case, Soul Sensor could be a very handy tool.

Both the Soul Sensor and an App work 24/7 and activate automatically when Soul devices are detected within the radius. You don't need to turn on/off Sensor or start tracking activity manually.

Soul Sensor is compatible with:

iOS 8+: iPhone (released 2011 or later): 
iPad (released 2012 or later): 
iPod Touch 5th gen.
Android 4.4 KitKat or newer with the Bluetooth Low Energy

Concepter Soul is Open Sourced! Are you interested in the time-tracking feature in your App? Would you like to add time-tracking feature to your wearable or Bluetooth device? Or even make your own time-tracker? Contact us regarding the API or electronics KIT.
Are you performing Social Study Research? You can easily upload tracked data in .xls format directly from the app!





We store your data safely on our servers and check everything twice. Only you have access to your personal data. Your account and data can be deleted upon your request. Happy face emoji.





Concepter Soul is both a useful App for smartphones and a stylish Sensor. You can use it as a key chain, wear it as a cool accessory, or put it in your wallet or pocket. You can take it anywhere!By the way, Soul is a great and unusual gift for any occasion as you give your time to someone special. 




Soul has an additional feature - key finder! You can see how far or close your Soul Sensor is in our app interface.



Anything else?
Yup. With the help of Concepter Soul App you can:

See people you spend the most time with;
Set up your goals and mark important people as soulmates;
Check daily and weekly progress;
Use “Let’s meet” feature to keep in touch;
Send private messages to your soulmates;
Get free weekly reports on how you invested your time;
Improve your lifestyle;
Be happier and make other people happy!





You might want to know if the Soul App is as accurate as the Sensor? Unfortunately, it is not. In short: The Soul App is guessing the time you’ve spent with others while the Soul Sensor is tracking the actual time.



The crowdfunding campaign is like a rose ceremony in the world of startups. So here we are, just a group of passionate innovators, standing in front of the IndieGoGo crowd, asking you to love us. This is what you get in return:

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Think for a minute how much more your utility bills are during the months you run your furnace or Air conditioner? <b>If you are like most home owners your Furnace or Air conditioner is running 10, 20 or 50% more than it should be. </b>What is causing that and what is it costing you? There is an air filter inside every home HVAC system! When that filter is clogged with dust up to 50% less air is reaching your equipment. That means the equipment will have to run that much more to cool or heat the same amount of air.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Our MERV 9 filter design allows for the stopping power of a high end filter, but with the air flow of a cheap one!</b>
<br/></p><hr/><br/>
<h3>Reducing Costs &amp; Emissions</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434483923/iznswigogcfmlscp1qbj.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-bottom: 25px;""/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you check out the on-line the experts they will tell you to change your “90 day rated” filter every month. Woven fiber Glass and Pleated fabric are the most common type of filters purchased in the market place today. Purchasing 8-20 of these filters a year contributes greatly to landfills (and their carbon emissions). For every 1% of households (1.23 million) that use a 1 year Castle filter we could save up to 212,790 cubic feet of land fill every year. That's over the size of 220 School Busses. Lowering your waste doesn't just come from purchasing fewer filters, but because 50% of what makes every Castle Filter is recyclable!</p>
<br/><hr/><br/>
<h3>Why Castle Filters Work Better</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Paper &amp; fiberglass filters work on the premise of plugging up small holes with particles to prevent dust from getting on your HVAC unit. Every hole that gets plugged is one more hole that isn't allowing airflow.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434484938/j4no8xcsv1l3qh3o6ypn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p style=""color: #cccccc;"">Side view of a standard household HVAC pleated filter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;"">Castle Filters have 400% more surface area for dust &amp; other particles to collect. Because the internal foam is treated with a sticky material, you don't have to sacrifice stopping power for airflow.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434484983/pk0e8wo32sz9jvllowx2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p style=""color: #cccccc;"">Side view of a Castle Filter! More surface area &amp; greater air flow means less hassle.</p>

<h3>How We Can Make it Happen: With Your Help!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Castle Air Filters is a patent pending HVAC air filtration system. The design is based upon the revolutionary No Toil air filtration technology trusted by offroad enthusiasts &amp; professional action sports athletes the world over. Convenient Air Filter Maintenance has always been our goal &amp; with you help we can do so much more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our facilities &amp; staff are all ready for Castle Filters. Once funded we can order the foam &amp; recycled plastic needed for this large scale of a project. Funding will also be used to have the injection moulds manufactured. We have the capability to manufacture 100% of the materials for all filters under 20"". All 20"" filter casings will be sourced from another company. This product is proudly manufactured 100% in the United States.</p>

<h4>All We Need Is Your Help!</h4>

<h3>Thank You For Visiting!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We hope you can make a contribution to Castle Filters. Even a small contribution of $1 or more can make a huge difference in the future of Castle Filters.

Think for a minute how much more your utility bills are during the months you run your furnace or Air conditioner? If you are like most home owners your Furnace or Air conditioner is running 10, 20 or 50% more than it should be. What is causing that and what is it costing you? There is an air filter inside every home HVAC system! When that filter is clogged with dust up to 50% less air is reaching your equipment. That means the equipment will have to run that much more to cool or heat the same amount of air.
Our MERV 9 filter design allows for the stopping power of a high end filter, but with the air flow of a cheap one!

Reducing Costs & Emissions

If you check out the on-line the experts they will tell you to change your “90 day rated” filter every month. Woven fiber Glass and Pleated fabric are the most common type of filters purchased in the market place today. Purchasing 8-20 of these filters a year contributes greatly to landfills (and their carbon emissions). For every 1% of households (1.23 million) that use a 1 year Castle filter we could save up to 212,790 cubic feet of land fill every year. That's over the size of 220 School Busses. Lowering your waste doesn't just come from purchasing fewer filters, but because 50% of what makes every Castle Filter is recyclable!

Why Castle Filters Work Better
Paper & fiberglass filters work on the premise of plugging up small holes with particles to prevent dust from getting on your HVAC unit. Every hole that gets plugged is one more hole that isn't allowing airflow.

Castle Filters have 400% more surface area for dust & other particles to collect. Because the internal foam is treated with a sticky material, you don't have to sacrifice stopping power for airflow.
