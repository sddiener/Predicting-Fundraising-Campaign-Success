Photography was not the focus of the trip, although I was fortunate to have come home with some imagery to help tell my story now.</i></p><p><br/></p><h3>Beginnings</h3><p>After several years of struggling with identity and purpose, fears and doubts, I find myself where I have always belonged, although I was long afraid to embrace it: the arts. If we were to sit down together, you with a coffee and me with a tea, or if we were to walk one cool morning through the foothills of San Diego, I would tell you about my journey in detail. But for now I will give you the essentials: in a season of suffering I asked God the infamous question: WHY. I didn't understand, I felt knocked down, as if I were drifting along in existence. I needed to know that God's involvement in my life was intimate, that he did in fact see me and care about even the most intricate details of my life. I wrestled him for answers. No, he didn't tell me why—but he answered the question that really mattered: he responded by saying ""I am with you."" I knew this before but I did not know this really. I am with you, he said, and I am not just observing you with compassion but I am beside you in every moment, feeling with you every heartache, every sigh of relief, every rising joy.</p><p>This is good news, this Emmanuel, God with us. It changes everything. </p><p>So, from this place of rest in God's presence I began to ask a new question, the one outlined in the video above: Who am I? Because if he created me and he knows my every intricacy, then He must have had some intention in who he made me to be. As the dreams I had made and made again for myself continually shattered, I asked God for his purpose with my life. If I am here, please use me, I told him. Show me who you have made me to be, show me the gifts you have given me and how You want me to use them. I did not want a drifting existence any longer. I wanted substance and abundance. I wanted the deeper and truer life he held out to me instead of the small dreams I had held tightly on to. So I began to listen to Him speak the calling over me that I had been too afraid to step into before due to subconscious fears of failure.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3 style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif !important; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px !important; font-size: 24px !important; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(42, 42, 42) !important; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"">So what now?</h3><p></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal;""></span></p><p style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"">Now I desire to use the gifts, skills, and passions I've been given at their highest potential.

In the last year and a half those fears have been revealed to me, and I have made the choice to step past them and to stop hiding the gifts I've been given. When I realized that it was time to invest in my photography, I knew I didn't want to invest trivially. I wanted to use it purposefully and with intention.

soothes - for the young and old, healthy or sick. It is my hope that my
colorful collage also provides visual stimulation, calms stress and anxiety,
and evokes fond memories of connecting with the earth and nature. <span>My photographs are windows into summertime that reveal

The book itself is 300mm x 260mm, 160 pages packed with incredible images of Noor and her life. The cover is not the usual dust jacket, instead we have chosen a slightly vintage approach to instead have the cover printed straight onto the book.

We are not allowed to use camera traps (which both of us dislike anyway) and have to shoot from the road at all times. To get low angles means using the natural contours of each zone, and working with other jeeps so that they understand what we are trying to achieve. We concentrate on light and composition to tell our story, and as ever the amazing Noor is a very willing subject!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536765651/qxft6ibtfp5hqbw7zwbt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>One of the areas of photography that is perhaps the toughest to get, because of the topography, are landscapes of the area. So we decided early on that most of our wide angles would involve a tiger, and that we would not include landscapes just for the sake of it. We also decided very early on to push the boundaries of our photography and use monochrome and infra-red imagery to really tell the story that we wanted to. The habitat is a harsh and unforgiving place, particularly in the extreme heat of summer (where it can be 47C and more), and we were determined to show that. The result is a mixture of photographic styles and techniques that few books have ever seen. This book is very, and unashamedly, picture led. We have a good story throughout so you know what's happening and what we felt at the time, but it's very very picture led...</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536306817/p8qbaqjomdi6pin98leg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><i><strong>Conservation Focus</strong></i></u></h2><p>There is no doubt that tigers are in trouble but we believe 100% that they will continue to survive as enough talented people are dedicated to their conservation.

They are based in Ranthambhore and work with the local people on the boundary zones of the national park, where conflicts and poaching can occur. You can see one of <i>their</i><strong><i> in-the-field</i></strong> seminars in the pictures above.</p><p>There are many great charities and organisations doing great work, we have highlighted some of these in the book, but since Tiger Watch is local and works to protect tigers like Noor <strong>we are going to use some proceeds from the sales of this book to fund some of their projects</strong>. We don't make great claims about this, and it's not a fixed percentage, but when we get decent sales revenue we will see which Tiger Watch projects we can help fund and will publish the details on social media. That's why we aren't making a great claim about this, we are doing because it's the right thing!</p><p>So as photographers where do we fit in conservation? Well we have both raised funds for conservation projects in Ranthambhore, the last one was to dig a well on the outskirts of Ranthambhore to stop tigers going into villages to get water in the dry season. You didn't see it on social? No because we took some of the profits from Andy's first tiger book and used them without any fanfare. Also from that book donations were made to several other NGO's as well. </p><p>We don't make any claims about our conservation credentials, as we are just two tiger loving photographers. But what we do is to give wild tigers great PR throughout the world with our work, and allow others much more talented than we are to deliver their conservation messages more effectively by using our powerful imagery. We are PR agents for Noor and her fellow tigers. And that is the focus behind this book, we want you to love tigers like we do, and perhaps afterwards get involved by supporting one of the organisations that we highlight.  Only by supporting these great organisations and the valuable work that they do, and getting greater public awareness, will the tiger survive. We have all got to learn to live together in this expanding world, and that desire must come from within.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong>Perks and Details</strong></u></i></h2><p>We have tried to offer you decent discounts on perks and also some things that money cannot buy.

Working together over a 2 month period we developed a bond and an understanding that has grown into our ‘family’ relationship today. It was Noor that really brought us together though, as over the years this incredible tigress has opened up her lives in front of us and treated us to some incredible intimate encounters. It is these encounters that form the backbone of this book and to which we invite you to share with us.</p><p>Both of us love photographing tigers, you could say we are addicts, and we are both very good at it. It doesn’t matter to either of us who has won the most awards, we enjoy sharing our photography together and bouncing ideas off each other. That is very much the philosophy of this book; you will not know who took the individual images as it doesn’t matter, our time with Noor has always been a shared experience and that is the message that we want to bring from this book. Teamwork. Collaboration. United by a passion for photography, tigers and conservation. That is what defines us.</p><p>So what is so special about Noor as there are many great tigress’s in Ranthambhore? It’s hard to describe really, she’s just the ultimate tigress for us, an incredibly ruthless killing machine one minute and a tender mother the next. There’s no doubt she’s a mean mamma. Really mean, sometimes scarily so. On more than one occasion her piercing stare has made both of us take our eyes back from the camera and look away. We love her all the more for this, we are drawn to her; she’s our muse, we have spent every moment we can in her territory and in return she has shared incredible moments of her life with us. </p><p>Noor’s territory spans Ranthambhore zones 1,2 and part of 6, all three are tough and uncompromising places to live. Winters are freezing cold whilst the summer heat is relentless and unforgiving; everywhere you look towering bluffs dominate the skyline; dark, threatening, and unwelcoming to all comers. In this tough environment Noor has flourished, raising 3 litters to maturity, with her cubs spreading out across Ranthambhore and beyond. </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong>About the Team</strong></u></i></h2><p>From the very start we wanted to create something that appealed to a wide diversity of tiger lovers worldwide, from conservationists to photographers to those that just love all things tiger. So we’ve worked very hard on this project and dedicated so much time over the past few months to getting the right images in the book that allow us to tell our story.</p><p><strong>Nick Otway</strong></p><p>From the outset we knew that we needed a great designer, someone who could take our vision and make sense of it. Andy had worked with Nick before and was impressed by his determination to produce something very different, through a willingness to bend perceived rules. As the book evolved from it’s earliest scribbles, Nick listened to our stories and really helped us build a structure that made sense. So we hope when you pick it up and read it you will see that it flows really well through our encounters with Noor, many of which have been published in the national and international press.</p><p><strong>Valmik Thapar</strong></p><p>We start with a wonderful foreword from India’s foremost tiger expert Valmik Thapar, who really sets the book into perspective. In his words:</p><p><i>Aditya ‘Dicky’ Singh and Andy Rouse capture the incredible beauty of the tiger through the story of Noor who survived this last decade and epitomises the very best of Ranthambhore’s amazing tigers. I am certain that Dicky and Andy have created a book that will always be a landmark in the ever-evolving natural historyof Ranthambhore’s tigers.</i></p><p><strong> Photo Team - Andy Rouse and Aditya ""Dicky"" Singh</strong></p><p>You may or may not know much about us. Well we are both professional wildlife photographers, have both won major international awards, are both proud Dads and both share a love of all things tiger. Here's what we think of each other...</p><p><strong><i>Dicky on Andy</i></strong> - “I first met Andy Rouse, over a decade ago, when he came down to Ranthambhore to work on his tiger book after I had promised to get him some amazing tiger images. I had heard of Andy from before and had been following his work for a few years. I knew he was good, really good at his work. I had been living on the outskirts of Ranthambhore for over a decade and had worked with many cinematographers and photographers, though none of them was like Mr Rouse. At that time, I knew Ranthambhore better than most people in this world and I thought I knew enough about photography not to embarrass myself. The eight weeks or so that we spent together, shooting tigers in Ranthambhore in 2008, was a big milestone in my life, a time when I found a guru and a close friend. At the end of our eight weeks together, he called me a photographer. When Andy Rouse starts calling you a “photographer” you know  you have arrived. I had graduated from a “camera owner”  to an “outdoor photographer.” Finally I had moved from taking pictures, to making them. Since then we have personally grown really close to each other, more family than friends. Over the years, we have shot a lot of images together and partied a lot, something that both of us plan to keep doing. Andy is an amazing animal photographer, though slightly crazy and that is why we get along so damn well.”</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536744782/ndkis274pb8wyv6tlaxo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><i>Andy on Dicky</i></strong> - “I first met Dicky in order to work on my first Tiger book. He had written me this email out of the blue criticising my existing tiger work and saying that he could get me far better images in Ranthambhore in exchange for some photographic tuition. It was cheeky to the point of me deleting the email, but there was also something about it that made me respond, and made me take that chance over 10 years ago. Since then I’ve become one of the family at  his home and shared so many wonderful adventures, many of which you will see in this book. I’ve watched as he has grown in stature as a photographer, he’s always had the gift of knowing tiger behaviour but I’ve expanded his horizons and shown him new ways of shooting. Many of the amazing infrared images in this book are his, certainly a case of the student becoming the master. As a conservationist you will never find anyone more passionate and willing to engage in the fiery world of social media to defend his beloved Ranthambhore. On the social side he is a larger than life character with an army of close friends who I now call my own; we’ve shared some heavy parties together too, both at Holi festival and his legendary 50th birthday week. In conclusion, Dicky is the most trustworthy, loyal and decent friend I could wish to have, and as a photographer he is simply one of the best.”</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536307444/ekr9fp4fk0tuiugoymow.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2><u><strong>And Finally</strong></u></h2><p>​So that is it, if you have got to the bottom here you must be keen.

</ol></div>","IntroductionWelcome from Andy Rouse and Aditya ""Dicky"" Singh. We are two tiger nutcases and professional photographers, born on different continents but now close family. We've been brought together by our love of tigers and for one amazing tigress called Noor. Here she is...It's taken us 4 years to bring you this book, that's 4 years of very dedicated photography.We've followed Noor through the highs and the lows of her life, the result is a stunning 160 page fine art book that needs your support to make all our efforts worthwhile. It's a lavishly illustrated book, there are no filler images here, our photography is world class and so is the book...as befits the Queen of Ranthambhore. Here's 5 reasons why you should support this campaign:
Jaw dropping images including hunting sequences and tender moments with cubs
Engaging stories that bring the pictures to life and put you right there with us
A conservation focus and support for local Ranthambhore conservation projects
Simply because images look better in print than on the screen
Perks for Indian based supporters with local postage from Delhi. Low postage rates for Australia / NZ / USA and Canada check the Perks with flags for details. 
And  if you don't support us then we may knock on your door looking like this!!!!I know it is a frightening thought!Our book is packed with JAW DROPPING IMAGES like these: The book has something for everyone:For the Tiger Lover - we cover all aspects of Noor's life via a collection of stories about our most wonderful encounters with her. We've included other wildlife too, leopards, birds, deer all feature. The writing puts you right there with us at the decisive moments, it will captivate you and really bring the pictures to life. For the Photographer - the images will inspire you with a mixture of styles rarely seen in any wildlife book encompassing colour, monochrome and Infra-Red. With the latter we have a lovely Infra-Red portfolio showing Noor's territory in the harsh light of Summer. Plus you will get commentary throughout on what it's like being a Noor photographer AND two spreads of Photo Hints & Tips that you can use for your own photography.Noor, Queen of Ranthambhore is designed and ready to print at the best fine art book printers in Italy, all we need is your support. Here's the cover spread:Perks - So we've put together a range of perks for you, all giving great discounts to encourage you too support us in this campaign and get this beautiful book published. It's no risk for you either as we will supply your Perk even if we do not reach our complete funding target, so why not save some more and support a great project today!Indian Supporters - tired of paying big postage charges for books? Well not on here, we have setup two special perks for you identified by your national flag. Books ordered through these Perks will be posted directly from Delhi. Here we are working in the field over the 4 years that it took to shoot this book!The Book ProjectSince we wanted to produce something quite special we have used the best in the business,  Printer Trento in Italy, to produce a book of stunning quality. The book itself is 300mm x 260mm, 160 pages packed with incredible images of Noor and her life. The cover is not the usual dust jacket, instead we have chosen a slightly vintage approach to instead have the cover printed straight onto the book. It’s a beautiful book and we know that you will love it. Here's Andy & designer Nick Otway checking out the final proofs of the cover in London, and you can see he is very happy!!!!This is why, here's a few spreads from the final PDF:Photography in Ranthambhore is tough as there are no concessions, and rightly so. We are not allowed to use camera traps (which both of us dislike anyway) and have to shoot from the road at all times. To get low angles means using the natural contours of each zone, and working with other jeeps so that they understand what we are trying to achieve. We concentrate on light and composition to tell our story, and as ever the amazing Noor is a very willing subject!One of the areas of photography that is perhaps the toughest to get, because of the topography, are landscapes of the area. So we decided early on that most of our wide angles would involve a tiger, and that we would not include landscapes just for the sake of it. We also decided very early on to push the boundaries of our photography and use monochrome and infra-red imagery to really tell the story that we wanted to. The habitat is a harsh and unforgiving place, particularly in the extreme heat of summer (where it can be 47C and more), and we were determined to show that. The result is a mixture of photographic styles and techniques that few books have ever seen. This book is very, and unashamedly, picture led. We have a good story throughout so you know what's happening and what we felt at the time, but it's very very picture led...Conservation FocusThere is no doubt that tigers are in trouble but we believe 100% that they will continue to survive as enough talented people are dedicated to their conservation. Whether it be at international, national or grass roots level, there are tiger champions everywhere and we have included a section in this book to show you the people who we think are making a real difference... One particular local organisation that we work closely with is called Tiger Watch. They are based in Ranthambhore and work with the local people on the boundary zones of the national park, where conflicts and poaching can occur. You can see one of their in-the-field seminars in the pictures above.There are many great charities and organisations doing great work, we have highlighted some of these in the book, but since Tiger Watch is local and works to protect tigers like Noor we are going to use some proceeds from the sales of this book to fund some of their projects. We don't make great claims about this, and it's not a fixed percentage, but when we get decent sales revenue we will see which Tiger Watch projects we can help fund and will publish the details on social media. That's why we aren't making a great claim about this, we are doing because it's the right thing!So as photographers where do we fit in conservation? Well we have both raised funds for conservation projects in Ranthambhore, the last one was to dig a well on the outskirts of Ranthambhore to stop tigers going into villages to get water in the dry season. You didn't see it on social? No because we took some of the profits from Andy's first tiger book and used them without any fanfare. Also from that book donations were made to several other NGO's as well. We don't make any claims about our conservation credentials, as we are just two tiger loving photographers. But what we do is to give wild tigers great PR throughout the world with our work, and allow others much more talented than we are to deliver their conservation messages more effectively by using our powerful imagery. We are PR agents for Noor and her fellow tigers. And that is the focus behind this book, we want you to love tigers like we do, and perhaps afterwards get involved by supporting one of the organisations that we highlight.  Only by supporting these great organisations and the valuable work that they do, and getting greater public awareness, will the tiger survive. We have all got to learn to live together in this expanding world, and that desire must come from within.Perks and DetailsWe have tried to offer you decent discounts on perks and also some things that money cannot buy. For the benefit of our India based supporters we have also created a couple of special Perks for you, like local postage from Delhi thus saving large courier costs. The Regular EditionThe beautiful regular edition of the book will be signed by both of us. Don't ask as it was a logistical nightmare but this is truly unique and will be the only time you can get both of us signing the books, right here right now!  We estimate shipping to begin in early November and will contact you before shipping to see if you'd like a personal dedication. India based clients please see below as we have a special perk for you!Please see FAQ for postage details.The Regular Edition India EditionFor our India based supporters, this is exactly the same as the Regular Edition except that it's posted from Delhi so the postage cost is a reasonable one. Noor Collectors EditionThe Collectors Edition of the book is a Perk for the person that wants something a little more exclusive.

Working together over a 2 month period we developed a bond and an understanding that has grown into our ‘family’ relationship today. It was Noor that really brought us together though, as over the years this incredible tigress has opened up her lives in front of us and treated us to some incredible intimate encounters. It is these encounters that form the backbone of this book and to which we invite you to share with us.Both of us love photographing tigers, you could say we are addicts, and we are both very good at it. It doesn’t matter to either of us who has won the most awards, we enjoy sharing our photography together and bouncing ideas off each other. That is very much the philosophy of this book; you will not know who took the individual images as it doesn’t matter, our time with Noor has always been a shared experience and that is the message that we want to bring from this book. Teamwork. Collaboration. United by a passion for photography, tigers and conservation. That is what defines us.So what is so special about Noor as there are many great tigress’s in Ranthambhore? It’s hard to describe really, she’s just the ultimate tigress for us, an incredibly ruthless killing machine one minute and a tender mother the next. There’s no doubt she’s a mean mamma. Really mean, sometimes scarily so. On more than one occasion her piercing stare has made both of us take our eyes back from the camera and look away. We love her all the more for this, we are drawn to her; she’s our muse, we have spent every moment we can in her territory and in return she has shared incredible moments of her life with us. Noor’s territory spans Ranthambhore zones 1,2 and part of 6, all three are tough and uncompromising places to live. Winters are freezing cold whilst the summer heat is relentless and unforgiving; everywhere you look towering bluffs dominate the skyline; dark, threatening, and unwelcoming to all comers. In this tough environment Noor has flourished, raising 3 litters to maturity, with her cubs spreading out across Ranthambhore and beyond. About the TeamFrom the very start we wanted to create something that appealed to a wide diversity of tiger lovers worldwide, from conservationists to photographers to those that just love all things tiger. So we’ve worked very hard on this project and dedicated so much time over the past few months to getting the right images in the book that allow us to tell our story.Nick OtwayFrom the outset we knew that we needed a great designer, someone who could take our vision and make sense of it. Andy had worked with Nick before and was impressed by his determination to produce something very different, through a willingness to bend perceived rules. As the book evolved from it’s earliest scribbles, Nick listened to our stories and really helped us build a structure that made sense. So we hope when you pick it up and read it you will see that it flows really well through our encounters with Noor, many of which have been published in the national and international press.Valmik ThaparWe start with a wonderful foreword from India’s foremost tiger expert Valmik Thapar, who really sets the book into perspective. In his words:Aditya ‘Dicky’ Singh and Andy Rouse capture the incredible beauty of the tiger through the story of Noor who survived this last decade and epitomises the very best of Ranthambhore’s amazing tigers. I am certain that Dicky and Andy have created a book that will always be a landmark in the ever-evolving natural historyof Ranthambhore’s tigers. Photo Team - Andy Rouse and Aditya ""Dicky"" SinghYou may or may not know much about us. Well we are both professional wildlife photographers, have both won major international awards, are both proud Dads and both share a love of all things tiger. Here's what we think of each other...Dicky on Andy - “I first met Andy Rouse, over a decade ago, when he came down to Ranthambhore to work on his tiger book after I had promised to get him some amazing tiger images. I had heard of Andy from before and had been following his work for a few years. I knew he was good, really good at his work. I had been living on the outskirts of Ranthambhore for over a decade and had worked with many cinematographers and photographers, though none of them was like Mr Rouse. At that time, I knew Ranthambhore better than most people in this world and I thought I knew enough about photography not to embarrass myself. The eight weeks or so that we spent together, shooting tigers in Ranthambhore in 2008, was a big milestone in my life, a time when I found a guru and a close friend. At the end of our eight weeks together, he called me a photographer. When Andy Rouse starts calling you a “photographer” you know  you have arrived. I had graduated from a “camera owner”  to an “outdoor photographer.” Finally I had moved from taking pictures, to making them. Since then we have personally grown really close to each other, more family than friends. Over the years, we have shot a lot of images together and partied a lot, something that both of us plan to keep doing. Andy is an amazing animal photographer, though slightly crazy and that is why we get along so damn well.”Andy on Dicky - “I first met Dicky in order to work on my first Tiger book. He had written me this email out of the blue criticising my existing tiger work and saying that he could get me far better images in Ranthambhore in exchange for some photographic tuition. It was cheeky to the point of me deleting the email, but there was also something about it that made me respond, and made me take that chance over 10 years ago. Since then I’ve become one of the family at  his home and shared so many wonderful adventures, many of which you will see in this book. I’ve watched as he has grown in stature as a photographer, he’s always had the gift of knowing tiger behaviour but I’ve expanded his horizons and shown him new ways of shooting. Many of the amazing infrared images in this book are his, certainly a case of the student becoming the master. As a conservationist you will never find anyone more passionate and willing to engage in the fiery world of social media to defend his beloved Ranthambhore. On the social side he is a larger than life character with an army of close friends who I now call my own; we’ve shared some heavy parties together too, both at Holi festival and his legendary 50th birthday week. In conclusion, Dicky is the most trustworthy, loyal and decent friend I could wish to have, and as a photographer he is simply one of the best.”And Finally​So that is it, if you have got to the bottom here you must be keen. We hope that you can support this project and allow Noor, Queen of Ranthambhore to be a reality. Important T&C's for all Perks

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>So hello there you awesome bunch of DNA :D </strong><br/>Time for an introduction. I am Amber. I am born in Holland and am since a short time living in Germany. I am the owner of Laguz photography and model under the name Machinefairy. As a graduated photographer I do what I love most: Photographing atmospheric and sometimes almost game screenshot-ish photos and portraits. Thanks to my love for game art, costumes and anything post apocalyptic and fantasy I am able to make my own little world, an escape from reality. Working in this style has my passion, I can build up my own world into a visible image to share with anyone who wants to see it. It is my escape from reality as well as a door to another world in one image to those who look at it. My photos have to speak to the imagination, to make people think of a story or scene it could be from.</p>
<p>My only thing is that I do not own a camera, I lend a Canon 60D from a good friend. But now that I am graduated and moving to another country it is time to hand it back to his owner. 'But no problem there, let's get a camera!' That's what you'd think right? Yeah I wish it was that way. To be able to fund a camera I need to make new work, but I can not work without a camera. Makes sense right? This is where you can help me if you like my work and want to make your part to get more art into this world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is needed and what will be funded:</h3>
<p>So, let's get into the financial details and where the money will go because I suppose you would like to know what happens with it and I fully agree with that:</p>
<p>- 5% goes to Indiegogo (100-,)</p>
<p>which leaves us with 1900-,</p>
<p>- I estimated the production of the perks and all to 400-,</p>
<p>And then we are at 1500-,</p>
<p>- I am aiming to buy a Canon 80D which is currently priced at 1040-, for just a body.</p>
<p>- 450-, is left now.</p>
<p>This money will be used for a lens: the Tamron 28-75/2.8 (I already own a Canon 50mm 1.8)</p>
<p><i>But what if we go over the goal? Then I will check out what can be bought for that money to enhance my work more. Studio lights for example or even a better lens or body then I had in mind. Let's just try to reach the original goal first &lt;3</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So what happens if I will not reach my goal?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on how far I will be towards my goal. I wil always have to pay the 5%. Then I get the prints, posters and calendars and send them. What is left will first be used for a body (without the lens). If it is not enough to buy the body of the 80D I will choose to either save it up and keep it untill I have enough money for it or either will I buy a secondhand body, depending on the amount of money that is left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So, now you know where the money goes, but what do you get?</strong></p>
<p>On the side of this page I have a variety of perks you can choose from if you want more then just fund me. You can choose from a lot of different pieces of art like prints, posters and calendars. the first ones will be made and send out in 30 days. the second batch will be made and send out 30 days after that.</p>
<p>these posters and calendars will ONLY be given during this funding and so are limited edition!</p>
<p>If there is something that you would love to have (A specific picture as print for example?) but is not there, please let me know and maybe we can figure something out and I can make you a personalized perk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the perks you are able to choose between images of my photography and my modeling work. just to make a bit more clear of what is what; here you can find bigger images and the names (Calendars ca be found on top of this page):</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So why would you fund me, what is in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>Well, for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p>- You help me to pursue my dream job</p>
<p>- You will have a great feeling of being able to help someone</p>
<p>- You will help putting more art into the world</p>
<p>- With getting certain perks you have some limited edition art items (Calendars and posters)</p>
<p>- with all of these, you make the world a better place &lt;3 </p>
<p>- Also, with every perk I will add your name in a major thank you post on my social media pages and blog (lifeofLaguz). (You can choose if you want your name mentioned or not)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You back me up into new and running projects (books).</strong></p>
<p>I have plans to make the post apocalypse scene that I photograph into a bigger project, maybe for galleries or a book.</p>
<p>And currently I have a running project about the image of beauty, aesthetics and mindset of people that are different from what 'society' expects, that I eventually want to make into a book, it is a long running project. To me it is not only a photography project, but it is also making a visible add to documenting 'today', literally making history for the future. You can find all about it on <a href=""http://www.laguzphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.laguzphotography.com</a> under ' project I AM'.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Back Story</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is David Thomas. I am a freelance photographer in Austin, TX. My hard drive crashed. This project is to raise funds to pay to have my photographic files recovered.</p>
<p>Since 2008, I have been chronicling political and other events in Austin, TX. After retiring as a project manager in the D.C. area I moved to Austin, TX, where I was determined to return to my first love - photography - and to become involved in my community. I have been able to do both.</p>
<p>While I had completely backed up all photos processed on a PC, I neglected to do so with about 20,000 photos processed on a Macbook Pro, using Lightroom, since the fall of 2012. I couldn't back them up on my PC-formatted external hard drive and I kept putting off getting one for my Mac. Biggest mistake of my professional life.</p>
<p><b>Extent of loss - History:</b><br/></p>
<p>I am just sick over the possible loss of these photos. They represent personal milestones, professional achievements, and political history. They include full resolution files <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">for a client running to be a judge in Travis County. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Another client has lost, to now, photos taken at her wedding reception. Other files lost are of other clients and interested parties who keep coming back for this photo or that: wedding and engagement parties, Mitzvah, Community/neighborhood events and ceremonies, Veterans events, numerous political campaigns, head shots, group shots, dinners and galas for charitable organizations, photos from Sierra Club campaigns, the Texas Democratic State Convention and the Democratic National Convention. And I was at the Texas State Capitol this summer. I was there for the whole thing. Clients who know about the crash are understanding, but very disappointed. I would like to take away that disappointment.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Luckily, the shot above was not lost, but generations could have been denied this important portrait of Texas history in the making! Help me to prevent other moments of history being lost!</p>

My name is David Thomas. I am a freelance photographer in Austin, TX. My hard drive crashed. This project is to raise funds to pay to have my photographic files recovered.
Since 2008, I have been chronicling political and other events in Austin, TX. After retiring as a project manager in the D.C. area I moved to Austin, TX, where I was determined to return to my first love - photography - and to become involved in my community. I have been able to do both.
While I had completely backed up all photos processed on a PC, I neglected to do so with about 20,000 photos processed on a Macbook Pro, using Lightroom, since the fall of 2012. I couldn't back them up on my PC-formatted external hard drive and I kept putting off getting one for my Mac. Biggest mistake of my professional life.
Extent of loss - History:
I am just sick over the possible loss of these photos. They represent personal milestones, professional achievements, and political history. They include full resolution files for a client running to be a judge in Travis County. Another client has lost, to now, photos taken at her wedding reception. Other files lost are of other clients and interested parties who keep coming back for this photo or that: wedding and engagement parties, Mitzvah, Community/neighborhood events and ceremonies, Veterans events, numerous political campaigns, head shots, group shots, dinners and galas for charitable organizations, photos from Sierra Club campaigns, the Texas Democratic State Convention and the Democratic National Convention. And I was at the Texas State Capitol this summer. I was there for the whole thing. Clients who know about the crash are understanding, but very disappointed. I would like to take away that disappointment.



Luckily, the shot above was not lost, but generations could have been denied this important portrait of Texas history in the making! Help me to prevent other moments of history being lost!





What I Need & What You Get
Ideally:
My goal now is $2,000. The funding goal of $3,000 set up at the beginning of this effort is unchangeable, but the company that is doing the recovery, DriveSavers, has lowered the amount they will charge me, since this is not a rush. The hard drive is at DriveSavers, a clean-room data recovery firm in California. They tell me that they may be able to recover all my photo files, or none. The cost is determined by whether or not and by what percentage of files they can recover. There are two steps to the recovery - mechanical and software recovery. They must first fix the mechanical problem before trying to recover the data. If I am able to recover all data, and the charge is the full $1,692, the remaining $308 will go toward offsetting the costs for the new hard drive (I am using now), the new backup drive (hooked up now), and cloud storage. I do not want this to happen again.
What happens if I raise less money?
If I raise less than my goal, and less than the cost of recovery, all funds will go to that recovery. The recovery firm will allow me to pay off the remainder over time on a ""lay away"" basis. I will not receive the files until the total cost is covered. 
If you help fund my project, but data is not recovered and I am charged nothing, I will donate ALL funds to the Austin Children's Shelter for whom I have taken photos. Their work is invaluable. The Austin Children's Shelter protects and heals children, young adults and families in need. The Austin Children's Shelter believes that every child and young adult in our community deserves to feel safe and to receive nurturing care in order to grow into happy, responsible and fulfilled adults. Their goal is to end child abuse and neglect; to create a community and a world that has no need of a shelter for abused or neglected children.
If I raise more than is necessary to pay for the recovery and new hard drive and back up, all remaining funds will go toward the Austin Children's Shelter.
What do you get for helping me recover my photos?
For helping me, I offer you either greatly discounted downloads and prints, or discounted or free photo shoots (in Austin). I can offer the same photo shoots in Central Texas for expenses. The discounted offers appear to the right.

Damit Du Dir besser vorstellen kannst, wer und was Happy Berry 
Photography ist, möchte ich Dir gern alles vorstellen.
Mit der Fotografie habe ich im Frühjahr 2013 angefangen. Anfangs kannte 
man mich noch unter dem Namen „Shooter Style“. <br/>Erst klang es 
professionell und modern, doch mit der Zeit klang es für mich immer 
unpersönlicher. Es passte nicht zu mir. <br/>Ich bin ein fröhlicher Mensch 
und wollte, dass mein Name auch das ausstrahlt. Durch viele verschiedene
 Gedankengänge kam ich am Ende auf den Namen „Happy Berry Photography“.<br/><br/><b> Das Vorhaben :

<br/>Kurz und knackig erzählt, brauche ich finanzielle Unterstützung für 
diverses Fotoequipment &amp; Stylingzubehör (Fotostudio, Make-up, 
Objektive, etc.)

""Happy Berry Photography"" ist für mich weder ein Hobby, noch einfach das
 Fotografieren, sondern mein Leben. Ich fotografiere jeden Tag, und ohne
 meine Kamera wäre ich nicht mehr ich... Deshalb studiere ich auch 
Fotodesign um meinen Traum, das eigene Fotostudio, einmal zu 
verwirklichen.
Also ist das echt nicht nur ein Hobby, sondern eine reine 
Herzensangelegenheit.

Es ist ja nicht nur die Fotografie die mir besonderen Spaß macht, 
sondern auch das Stylen meiner Modele (Haare machen, Make-up, Kleidung 
heraussuchen, etc.)

Bitte helft Happy Berry Photography!<br/><br/><b> Für was ist das Geld, welches Du mir gibst?

</b><br/><br/>Das Geld ist in erster Linie dafür, neues Equipment (Objektiv in erster 
Linie) zu kaufen, wie jeder weiß nicht gerade billig, und als 21 jährige
 Studentin alleine nicht machbar.

Für Eure Spenden bekommt ihr auch etwas, von über Prints meiner festen 
Modele, bis hin zu etwas selbstgenähtem meiner Modele. Für diejenigen, 
die aus Leipzig kommen, biete ich dann auch aufregende Shootings an. 
Genaueres dann.

<br/>Wieso hänge ich so sehr an Happy Berry Photography?<br/><br/> Die Fotografie faszinierte mich schon sehr lange. Angefangen hat alles 
mit einigen Bildern für private Angelegenheiten, dann stellte sich das 
Fotografieren immer mehr in den Vordergrund. So kam es dann, dass ich 
deutlich öfter eine Linse vor dem Auge hatte. Allerdings empfand ich 
meine Werke am Anfang als nicht gut und dachte automatisch, dass ich 
total unbegabt bin, was mir einen Teil meiner Familie auch vermittelte 
und ich mit dem Hobby alleine da stand.<br/> Doch meine Faszination an den 
Bildern ließ mich hart arbeiten. Ich wollte nicht aufgeben, da jeder 
sagte, ich würde es nicht schaffen sei unbegabt. Darum übte ich weiter, 
probierte mich auch an Landschaften aus, und einige sparsame Monate 
später erfüllte ich mir den Wunsch einer (neueren) Spiegelreflexkamera.
<br/>Je weiter ich mich mit der Materie befasste, umso tiefer wurde die Liebe
 zur Fotografie. Doch nicht nur das einfache ""drauf halten und los 
fotografieren"" interessiert mich, sondern auch alles drum herum.<br/> Für mich geht es auch besonders darum, das perfekte Set zu haben, die 
richtige Location zu finden, das Model zu beraten und zu stylen – 
einfach alles um DAS Foto zu bekommen.

Ich bin ein offener Mensch. Ich rede gern und gehe auf neue Menschen zu,
 besonders, wenn ich merke, dass sie eine gewisse Schüchternheit 
besitzen, die die Arbeit blockieren könnte. Bei mir kannst Du gewiss 
sein, dass es keine peinliche Stille gibt, sondern es munter vor sich 
geht. Generell lache ich sehr gern und viel und animiere auch jedes 
Model dazu es ebenfalls zu tun. Gute Gespräche und einige Lacher 
erleichtern mir die Arbeit, und lassen jeden entspannen. Zudem lasse ich
 niemanden im Regen stehen. Vor jedem Shooting mache ich mir über Posen 
und Mimik Gedanken, damit die Schönheit des Einzelnen auch ans Licht 
kommt.
Nur ein begeisterndes Ergebnis stellt am Ende Dich zufrieden und im 
Umkehrschluss auch mich.

The youngest of the vets are nearing 90 years old and very soon, this opportunity will be lost.The book will be as much about as this diverse country as it will the men and women I meet. If I can mix this with stories no one else can tell and a perspective different to which young people are exposed, the book will be more than interesting, but also of importance.The interviews, while focusing on WWII experiences, will delve into post war experiences of the interviewees. This ties the men into the locales where they’re interviewed and elevates the undertaking beyond just a series of interviews. In order to achieve this sense of grounding, I will make an effort to avoid a series of photos at retirement homes.I hope this communicates the nature of our proposed undertaking, our artistic goals, through sight and sound, and our perceptive goals through the words and lives of the veterans.This was the wording of the ""one sheet"" I wrote that a production company saw and contacted me wanting to make this book. Unfortunately, after months of planning, investors of the film pulled out of the project and my movie was shelved.I'm coming to IndieGoGo with the hope of breathing new life into this project of mine. The funding of the project will go to:
renting equipment
renting a car to travel across the country
gas/accommodation
getting the book printed
reward fullfilment
What's great about funding this project, is that you actually fund the book as well.Here are some videos that I made to support the project:A recent interview with Major Francis Turner (ret)The Original Pitch for the Project 3 years agoInterviews with 'Saving Private Ryan' actor, Adam GoldbergIf this project gets funded, I will set out to start shooting immediately.

 What We Need & What You Get

Damit Du Dir besser vorstellen kannst, wer und was Happy Berry Photography ist, möchte ich Dir gern alles vorstellen. Mit der Fotografie habe ich im Frühjahr 2013 angefangen. Anfangs kannte man mich noch unter dem Namen „Shooter Style“. <br/>Erst klang es professionell und modern, doch mit der Zeit klang es für mich immer unpersönlicher. Es passte nicht zu mir. <br/>Ich bin ein fröhlicher Mensch und wollte, dass mein Name auch das ausstrahlt. Durch viele verschiedene Gedankengänge kam ich am Ende auf den Namen „Happy Berry Photography“.<br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884701/files/20140926113126-_DSC0060.jpg?1411756286"" src="""" style=""width: 374.111922141119px; height: 248px;""/></p><br/><p><b>Das Vorhaben : </b><br/></p><p>Kurz und knackig erzählt, brauche ich finanzielle Unterstützung für diverses Fotoequipment &amp; Stylingzubehör (Fotostudio, Make-up, Objektive, etc.) ""Happy Berry Photography"" ist für mich weder ein Hobby, noch einfach das Fotografieren, sondern mein Leben. Ich fotografiere jeden Tag, und ohne meine Kamera wäre ich nicht mehr ich... Deshalb studiere ich auch Fotodesign um meinen Traum, das eigene Fotostudio, einmal zu verwirklichen. Also ist das echt nicht nur ein Hobby, sondern eine reine Herzensangelegenheit. Es ist ja nicht nur die Fotografie die mir besonderen Spaß macht, sondern auch das Stylen meiner Modele (Haare machen, Make-up, Kleidung heraussuchen, etc.) Bitte helft Happy Berry Photography!<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884704/files/20140926113302-_DSC0219.jpg?1411756382"" src="""" style=""width: 187.252676659529px; height: 283px;""/></p><br/><p><b> Für was ist das Geld, welches Du mir gibst? </b><br/><br/>Das Geld ist in erster Linie dafür, neues Equipment (Objektiv in erster Linie) zu kaufen, wie jeder weiß nicht gerade billig, und als 21 jährige Studentin alleine nicht machbar.

Angefangen hat alles mit einigen Bildern für private Angelegenheiten, dann stellte sich das Fotografieren immer mehr in den Vordergrund. So kam es dann, dass ich deutlich öfter eine Linse vor dem Auge hatte. Allerdings empfand ich meine Werke am Anfang als nicht gut und dachte automatisch, dass ich total unbegabt bin, was mir einen Teil meiner Familie auch vermittelte und ich mit dem Hobby alleine da stand.<br/> Doch meine Faszination an den Bildern ließ mich hart arbeiten. Ich wollte nicht aufgeben, da jeder sagte, ich würde es nicht schaffen sei unbegabt. Darum übte ich weiter, probierte mich auch an Landschaften aus, und einige sparsame Monate später erfüllte ich mir den Wunsch einer (neueren) Spiegelreflexkamera. <br/>Je weiter ich mich mit der Materie befasste, umso tiefer wurde die Liebe zur Fotografie. Doch nicht nur das einfache ""drauf halten und los fotografieren"" interessiert mich, sondern auch alles drum herum.<br/> Für mich geht es auch besonders darum, das perfekte Set zu haben, die richtige Location zu finden, das Model zu beraten und zu stylen – einfach alles um DAS Foto zu bekommen. Ich bin ein offener Mensch. Ich rede gern und gehe auf neue Menschen zu, besonders, wenn ich merke, dass sie eine gewisse Schüchternheit besitzen, die die Arbeit blockieren könnte. Bei mir kannst Du gewiss sein, dass es keine peinliche Stille gibt, sondern es munter vor sich geht. Generell lache ich sehr gern und viel und animiere auch jedes Model dazu es ebenfalls zu tun. Gute Gespräche und einige Lacher erleichtern mir die Arbeit, und lassen jeden entspannen. Zudem lasse ich niemanden im Regen stehen. Vor jedem Shooting mache ich mir über Posen und Mimik Gedanken, damit die Schönheit des Einzelnen auch ans Licht kommt. Nur ein begeisterndes Ergebnis stellt am Ende Dich zufrieden und im Umkehrschluss auch mich. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884712/files/20140926113645-_DSC0216.jpg?1411756605"" src="""" style=""width: 380.876068376068px; height: 575px;""/></p><br/><p><i>Mit viel Willen, Dickköpfigkeit und den Halt meiner Schwiegerfamilie sowie meiner festen Modele, konnte ich das werden was ich jetzt bin...

Damit Du Dir besser vorstellen kannst, wer und was Happy Berry Photography ist, möchte ich Dir gern alles vorstellen. Mit der Fotografie habe ich im Frühjahr 2013 angefangen. Anfangs kannte man mich noch unter dem Namen „Shooter Style“. Erst klang es professionell und modern, doch mit der Zeit klang es für mich immer unpersönlicher. Es passte nicht zu mir. Ich bin ein fröhlicher Mensch und wollte, dass mein Name auch das ausstrahlt. Durch viele verschiedene Gedankengänge kam ich am Ende auf den Namen „Happy Berry Photography“.Das Vorhaben : Kurz und knackig erzählt, brauche ich finanzielle Unterstützung für diverses Fotoequipment & Stylingzubehör (Fotostudio, Make-up, Objektive, etc.) ""Happy Berry Photography"" ist für mich weder ein Hobby, noch einfach das Fotografieren, sondern mein Leben. Ich fotografiere jeden Tag, und ohne meine Kamera wäre ich nicht mehr ich... Deshalb studiere ich auch Fotodesign um meinen Traum, das eigene Fotostudio, einmal zu verwirklichen. Also ist das echt nicht nur ein Hobby, sondern eine reine Herzensangelegenheit. Es ist ja nicht nur die Fotografie die mir besonderen Spaß macht, sondern auch das Stylen meiner Modele (Haare machen, Make-up, Kleidung heraussuchen, etc.) Bitte helft Happy Berry Photography! Für was ist das Geld, welches Du mir gibst? Das Geld ist in erster Linie dafür, neues Equipment (Objektiv in erster Linie) zu kaufen, wie jeder weiß nicht gerade billig, und als 21 jährige Studentin alleine nicht machbar. Für Eure Spenden bekommt ihr auch etwas, von über Prints meiner festen Modele, bis hin zu etwas selbstgenähtem meiner Modele. Für diejenigen, die aus Leipzig kommen, biete ich dann auch aufregende Shootings an. Genaueres dann. Das geld geht ausschließlich an mich (Happy Berry) Was bewirkt ihr?: Ihr helft mir besseres Equipment zu bekommen und helft außerdem, dass ich mich verbessere. Happy Berry Photography ist wie gesagt ein Herzensprojekt und bedeutet mir wirklich verdammt viel, jeder Mensch hat träume und ich möchte den Traum real machen, ihr helft uns wirklich wahnsinnig viel mit jeder Spende (meinen festen Modelen und mir). Wieso hänge ich so sehr an Happy Berry Photography? Die Fotografie faszinierte mich schon sehr lange. Angefangen hat alles mit einigen Bildern für private Angelegenheiten, dann stellte sich das Fotografieren immer mehr in den Vordergrund. So kam es dann, dass ich deutlich öfter eine Linse vor dem Auge hatte. Allerdings empfand ich meine Werke am Anfang als nicht gut und dachte automatisch, dass ich total unbegabt bin, was mir einen Teil meiner Familie auch vermittelte und ich mit dem Hobby alleine da stand. Doch meine Faszination an den Bildern ließ mich hart arbeiten. Ich wollte nicht aufgeben, da jeder sagte, ich würde es nicht schaffen sei unbegabt. Darum übte ich weiter, probierte mich auch an Landschaften aus, und einige sparsame Monate später erfüllte ich mir den Wunsch einer (neueren) Spiegelreflexkamera. Je weiter ich mich mit der Materie befasste, umso tiefer wurde die Liebe zur Fotografie. Doch nicht nur das einfache ""drauf halten und los fotografieren"" interessiert mich, sondern auch alles drum herum. Für mich geht es auch besonders darum, das perfekte Set zu haben, die richtige Location zu finden, das Model zu beraten und zu stylen – einfach alles um DAS Foto zu bekommen. Ich bin ein offener Mensch. Ich rede gern und gehe auf neue Menschen zu, besonders, wenn ich merke, dass sie eine gewisse Schüchternheit besitzen, die die Arbeit blockieren könnte. Bei mir kannst Du gewiss sein, dass es keine peinliche Stille gibt, sondern es munter vor sich geht. Generell lache ich sehr gern und viel und animiere auch jedes Model dazu es ebenfalls zu tun. Gute Gespräche und einige Lacher erleichtern mir die Arbeit, und lassen jeden entspannen. Zudem lasse ich niemanden im Regen stehen. Vor jedem Shooting mache ich mir über Posen und Mimik Gedanken, damit die Schönheit des Einzelnen auch ans Licht kommt. Nur ein begeisterndes Ergebnis stellt am Ende Dich zufrieden und im Umkehrschluss auch mich. Mit viel Willen, Dickköpfigkeit und den Halt meiner Schwiegerfamilie sowie meiner festen Modele, konnte ich das werden was ich jetzt bin... Perfekt bin ich dennoch noch lange nicht, bitte helft mir es zu werden! Auch wenn ihr nichts spenden könnt, könnt ihr es empfehlen und weiter verbreiten. Schaut vorbei um weitere bilder zusehen :D",6.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>The project:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Today I'm sharing for the first time my biggest and most personal project: Estranged. This project is the culmination of a year of planning and production and is now in its final stages of completion. Estranged explores my personal experiences as a foreigner in the city of Paris, far from all family and previous social relationships.</p>
<p>This project is the final step towards my Bachelor of Photography and is the product of everything I've learned and experienced over the last few years in my studies. The series will be exhibited in a gallery setting for my graduation, but also at Paris Photo in November, one of the largest photography fairs in Europe. But to get to that point, I'll need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the cost and what do you get?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm an experimental photographer, and this project has allowed me to develop my creative and technical knowledge of the medium to create something that is very special to me. I have taken an old and mostly forgotten photographic process and transposed it into a contemporary setting. Invented in 1850, this process, known as albumen printing, is one of the oldest means of creating a photo. It is a purely analog process involving egg whites and silver to create a lasting image, and every print takes multiple days to produce. After finding and tweaking original chemical formulas, I have since been able to integrate this process in my work. If you'd like to learn more about albumen printing you can visit this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumen_print"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link</a>. Otherwise, I'll spare you the details.</p>
<p>The experimentation process has not been cheap however, and now I need your help to finalize the project! There will be eight pieces exhibited, each of them in their own frame. The framing alone will cost 600 euros, and the prints will cost around 400 euros for a total of 1000 euros. In addition to the pieces on the wall, my thesis will be on display along with my <a href=""https://spencermehling.myportfolio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">portfolio</a> with three other series I have produced. The portfolio has a total production cost of 150 euros plus another 200 euros for the printed thesis.</p>
<p>Any additional funds will be used to reimburse my production costs and allow me to continue making my art as I start my career as a professional photographer!</p>
<p>But don't worry, no matter the donation, you get something in return! Everyone is invited to the exhibition on June 27th in Paris so I can thank you in person, and to see what you've helped create! There are of course various kickbacks that you can see under ""perks"" as well!</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>In an old dusty Georgian car market, my brother and I found ourselves negotiating over a beat up Mitsubishi Pajero with two decades worth of dents and scratches. It had a broken door, no air-con, and a quarter million kilometers to it's name. It was perfect, we knew it would take us exactly where we needed to go. Over the next three months, we would drive Caspar 11,942 kilometers, venturing deep into the forgotten lands of Karakalpakstan, traversing some of the world's highest roads in the Pamir Mountains, and crossing the largest inland body of water, the Caspian Sea (the namesake of our car).</p>
<p>For many (myself included), Central Asia is just a large area on the map full of places you're not sure how to pronounce. A century of Soviet occupation cast the region in a shroud of secrecy, which since the fall of the Iron Curtain, has scarcely been lifted.

<p>1. Gathering the required content to create the book.<br/>- This stage has already been completed, so there are no longer any risk / challenges involved here.</p>
<p>2. Designing a quality book<br/>- In order to fully do justice to this project, I have given myself a 6 month period of working full time to bring this project to it's full potential.</p>
<p>3. Printing the book<br/>- As far as this challenge goes, high print fidelity and total quality control are the goals.

The Book
The Overland book is 146 pages sized at 24x30cm, printed on premium quality 100% PCW recycled papers. Starting with an introduction to the Silk Road and a map of our Journey, Overland; Through the Middle of the World takes you through a visual journey of Central Asia, aided by seldom told stories of culture and history.










The Story
In an old dusty Georgian car market, my brother and I found ourselves negotiating over a beat up Mitsubishi Pajero with two decades worth of dents and scratches. It had a broken door, no air-con, and a quarter million kilometers to it's name. It was perfect, we knew it would take us exactly where we needed to go. Over the next three months, we would drive Caspar 11,942 kilometers, venturing deep into the forgotten lands of Karakalpakstan, traversing some of the world's highest roads in the Pamir Mountains, and crossing the largest inland body of water, the Caspian Sea (the namesake of our car).
For many (myself included), Central Asia is just a large area on the map full of places you're not sure how to pronounce. A century of Soviet occupation cast the region in a shroud of secrecy, which since the fall of the Iron Curtain, has scarcely been lifted. The surprising reality is that for much of human history, the region was considered the center of civilization, consisting of trade routes threading their way from Europe to China. Overland; Through the Middle of the World, will take the reader on a visual journey across these almost forgotten lands. This large format coffee table book is an exploration of the culture, nature, and history of the people and places that range from Istanbul in Turkey, all the way through to the far reaches of Inner Kyrgyzstan.
  One of the main stylistic intentions of Overland is to draw aesthetic similarities across vastly differing subject matter, exposing parallels grounded in the universally shared human experience.  Along with history and culture, Overland draws from the stories of the people to immerse the reader deeper into the landscape. Such is the case with our time spent with K, a shepherd of the sparsely populated Ustyurt Plateau of Western Kazakhstan. Known to be one of the least hospitable environments on the planet, temperature swings of up to 100°C have been recorded between summer and winter months.  Or the stories of the people of Bulunkul. A town of 306 that has long survived nestled in the High Pamirs. Affectionately known as Central Asia's coldest town, they own little more than yaks, yet require nothing else to thrive in an environment of absolute extremes.  In between these stories, Overland will be filled with landscape focused photography that has been created in a minimalist, yet dynamic style with the intention that each photograph will magnify the emotions drawn from the subject.

My vision for this ground-breaking new book was inspired by the war photography that has shaped history. Images of conflict and suffering have always played a crucial role in exposing atrocities and galvanizing the masses.

The answer is that anyone who can help should look, and that is all of us. Billions of animals suffer needlessly each day within the constructs we’ve built.

<p><strong><i>conhecer um corpo</i></strong> é um livro que fala da intimidade dos corpos, do processo de autoconhecimento e de aprendizagem do <i>eu</i> a partir do <i>outro</i>. O processo fotográfico decorreu entre 2017 e 2019, mas só este ano evoluiu para um objecto com um sentido e uma intenção mais apurados. Nesse sentido, a construção deste livro partiu de um regresso ao meu arquivo para encontrar uma linha narrativa intencional que permeasse nas fotografias feitas durante esse tempo. De entre mais de duas mil fotografias, a escolha recaiu em cerca de cinquenta, que comunicam entre si uma ideia melancólica da procura da minha identidade através dos corpos e dos lugares que experimentei. Assim nasce <strong><i>conhecer um corpo</i></strong>.</p>

<p>Entre 2017 e 2019, tomei o hábito de pegar no meu carro e conduzir pelo país fora com uma certa frequência. Queria explorar Portugal, conhecer novas pessoas e novos sítios, queria escapar a minha própria solidão com o movimento, a estrada a passar por debaixo do meu carro. Levei a minha câmara fotográfica 35mm comigo e procurei paisagens que me atraíam, lugares que me chamavam a atenção, pessoas que me despertavam o interesse. E fotografei-os. Fotografei o mar, fotografei a terra, fotografei as cidades e as ruas, fotografei os rostos e os corpos, os corpos vestidos e despidos, parados e em movimento. Deixei-me vencer a minha dificuldade em falar com estranhos e deixaram de o ser. Abriram-se para a minha câmara, para o meu olhar, deixaram-se ser fotografados, explorados pela representação, tentados pelo desejo. E durante a procura do outro e de mais, gostava de dizer que me tinha encontrado a mim próprio; mas acho que isso não aconteceu. Foram precisos mais dois anos para perceber isso, foi preciso encontrar-me para perceber que isso ainda não tinha acontecido. Nesse sentido, olhei para trás, para as imagens que fiz nesses anos e seleccionei as que melhor comunicavam essa procura, a melancolia da exploração, do autoconhecimento, dos corpos dos outros em direcção ao meu corpo e à minha identidade. Uma colecção de imagens em que procuro nos corpos conhecer um corpo, o meu corpo.</p>

<p>Big Media constantly publish news full of stereotypes and prejudices, and to fight against this, the first step is the visibility of the LGBT community. So we need to go beyond the breaking news and tell our stories, our true stories. And make people see them, because in today's world, exists only what we see. So, if you don't see something, does not exist, and if that doesn't exist is not named. Therefore it’s important that people see things, so they know that are real and that are there.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span><br/></p>

<p>Hi I’m Kate, the photographer and author behind The Phone
Project.</p>
<p><b>What is The Phone Project?</b></p>
<p>It’s a full color collection of my photography capturing vintage
telephones in awkward landscapes, snuggled up in a book next to some of my flash fiction.</p><p>This is absolutely the coolest and most profound project I've ever put together. <br/></p>
<p>In a way it’s an absurdist comedy to place these phones in
places they would not usually be found and that’s the beauty of the concept and
the profundity of making art about the ways in which we communicate. </p>
<p>The Phone Project has been on my mind forever and I finally
started shooting it 5 years ago! Yes, 5 years ago! </p>
<p><b>WHY? <br/></b></p><p><b>Because Phones are Awesome</b><br/></p><p>For five years I’m been collecting phones and taking
pictures of them whenever I can and wherever I can. I’ve been documenting some
of our last remaining phone booths too while I’m at it. Now I have over 200 photographs
from NY to Death Valley, Seattle to the Salton Sea with a few more to take here
in Joshua Tree and Berlin. For those of you that know my work, my films can
take forever and usually when I make a book like my Mojave Weather Diaries, I
am making something super accessible between films that sustains my art
practice.</p>
<p>I always have writing available to me as my creative outlet
between bigger more expensive projects. I’ve successfully printed 4 Mojave
Weather Diaries without having to fund raise. But that’s because they are black
and white images from my sketchbook and it’s way less expensive to print than a
full color image book. That’s why I’m asking for your help this time!</p>
<p>It would be impossible for me to afford to print this book
without your contribution.</p>
<p>Usually with my art books I do a very limited edition and
this is for a few reasons: Firstly so the book will retain its value as a
special art object, to keep printing affordable for the comics, and to
reasonably distribute the art through small community readings and art
openings. I’d love to print The Phone Project in an edition of 250 which will
be more than I usually get to do, but it will still be small enough to be a
special art book and collectable.</p><p>One of the photos was recently featured in the projection of Open Desert at the Palm Springs Art Museum! <br/></p><p><b>How?</b></p><p><b>Pure Mettle and YOU!</b><br/></p>
<p>I’ve been very successful at setting my art goals and
achieving them, often in the spare few minutes I have between jobs and sleep
and sometimes between holding down 3 jobs and sleeps. I made a promise to
myself this year that I’d focus on finishing art projects that are important to
me and making sure I reach out to my audience and make my art available as I
go. </p>
<p>People are already willing to book me to do readings from
The Phone Project later this year. How awesome is that? I have an audience
waiting to laugh out loud to funny short stories about how we communicate and
enjoy beautiful phone photographs that will remind people of their childhoods,
our thoughts on technology, the myriad of metaphoric ways we use “the call” and
of course, the surreal aspect of an object in a sometimes unexpected place.</p>
<p>The last time I crowd funded for a book, I raised money to
pay my collaborators: the illustrator, the copy editor, the printer, and a web
designer. I met my goal!  A full
color photo book costs a lot more to print. Your donations at every level count
tremendously and at a $100 will get you a signed and numbered copy of the book
and some exciting special little art pieces I made just for this. The majority
of funds raised will go to the printing of the books. The rest will be divided
between: payment to a copy editor to help the fiction parts, rebooting the
Kidnap Yourself website to promote the book, some to help with the overhead
here at the Kidnap Yourself studio (I’ve never raised money to help keep the
lights on while I work, but need to admit I need the help!), and to upgrade
some of my camera equipment so I can take a few more crucial photos to top off
the fine collection of phones – for instance: I can take the very last photo in
Berlin when I’m there in September doing my very first artist residency!</p>
<p>I’m not down with the phrase “Passion project.” Art making
whether it is for my films, writing, painting or photography is my life, and my
life is something I’m passionate about but it’s no temporary thing or hobby,
this is my commitment to my audience and to inspire other art makers and
viewers along the way. I’ve been humbled and honored to receive praise for my
work and combining my writing and photographs is something I live for. You can
help! And your help at any level gets you a piece of art in return.</p><p><b>BUDGET</b></p><p>I thought I'd break down the budget so you know I'm being realistic and not overly ambitious.</p><p>The quote I have for 250, 100 page full color photo books with a  soft cover is $7,500. $1000 for the website re-launch, $400 for the copy editor, $800 for shipping and shipping packaging, $500 for the last camera gear, $960-1000 for the fees charged by Indie Gogo, and what's left is about $800 toward studio overhead.</p><p>It's easy to get to $12,000 making a full color book.</p><p>My dream would be to raise even more and do a Hardcover! And if we go over the amount, that's exactly what I'll do as a best case scenario.</p><p>If we can't raise the full amount, I will have to print less books, but will still need to raise approx $8,000 to pay for the other elements involved and print a beautiful edition of 100 books instead. Either way The Phone Project will be in your hands someday...by December!!<br/></p>
<p><b>YOU RULE!</b><br/></p><p>Thank you a million times over from my little desert art
studio and for helping make The Phone Project a bona fide work of art you can
hold in your hands.</p>

special art book and collectable.One of the photos was recently featured in the projection of Open Desert at the Palm Springs Art Museum! How?Pure Mettle and YOU!
I’ve been very successful at setting my art goals and
achieving them, often in the spare few minutes I have between jobs and sleep
and sometimes between holding down 3 jobs and sleeps. I made a promise to
myself this year that I’d focus on finishing art projects that are important to
me and making sure I reach out to my audience and make my art available as I
go. 
People are already willing to book me to do readings from
The Phone Project later this year. How awesome is that? I have an audience
waiting to laugh out loud to funny short stories about how we communicate and
enjoy beautiful phone photographs that will remind people of their childhoods,
our thoughts on technology, the myriad of metaphoric ways we use “the call” and
of course, the surreal aspect of an object in a sometimes unexpected place.
The last time I crowd funded for a book, I raised money to
pay my collaborators: the illustrator, the copy editor, the printer, and a web
designer. I met my goal!  A full
color photo book costs a lot more to print. Your donations at every level count
tremendously and at a $100 will get you a signed and numbered copy of the book
and some exciting special little art pieces I made just for this. The majority
of funds raised will go to the printing of the books. The rest will be divided
between: payment to a copy editor to help the fiction parts, rebooting the
Kidnap Yourself website to promote the book, some to help with the overhead
here at the Kidnap Yourself studio (I’ve never raised money to help keep the
lights on while I work, but need to admit I need the help!), and to upgrade
some of my camera equipment so I can take a few more crucial photos to top off
the fine collection of phones – for instance: I can take the very last photo in
Berlin when I’m there in September doing my very first artist residency!
I’m not down with the phrase “Passion project.” Art making
whether it is for my films, writing, painting or photography is my life, and my
life is something I’m passionate about but it’s no temporary thing or hobby,
this is my commitment to my audience and to inspire other art makers and
viewers along the way. I’ve been humbled and honored to receive praise for my
work and combining my writing and photographs is something I live for. You can
help! And your help at any level gets you a piece of art in return.BUDGETI thought I'd break down the budget so you know I'm being realistic and not overly ambitious.The quote I have for 250, 100 page full color photo books with a  soft cover is $7,500. $1000 for the website re-launch, $400 for the copy editor, $800 for shipping and shipping packaging, $500 for the last camera gear, $960-1000 for the fees charged by Indie Gogo, and what's left is about $800 toward studio overhead.It's easy to get to $12,000 making a full color book.My dream would be to raise even more and do a Hardcover! And if we go over the amount, that's exactly what I'll do as a best case scenario.If we can't raise the full amount, I will have to print less books, but will still need to raise approx $8,000 to pay for the other elements involved and print a beautiful edition of 100 books instead. Either way The Phone Project will be in your hands someday...by December!!
YOU RULE!Thank you a million times over from my little desert art
studio and for helping make The Phone Project a bona fide work of art you can
hold in your hands.

In Spring of 2015, I will be traveling to the country of Brazil to explore all that G-D wants to show me throughout this experience. I plan on traveling to the fashion capital of South America: São Paulo, Brazil. I will be documenting life, fashion trends, and how the culture differs from here in the United States.

<h3>At a glance...</h3>
My name is Ambre, I'm 27 years old and I really am passionate about photography. This is why since last year, I'm a student in a photography school in the north of France. Before that, I had the opportunity to be a professional photographer in Canada during 2 years. I learned a lot, but being a professional is not the same as being an artist ! This is why I slightly changed my way, and began this Bachelor in Photography. Now, I learn how to express myself in other ways, and I have found mine.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately for me, it's a pretty expensive way...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am fond of film photography, especially color. This is why I have recently bought a Rolleiflex, a 1959 camera, which uses unusual films. It's a great camera, which produces high quality pictures. The quality that I want and need for my project.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I love the Japanese poetry in photography, especially Rinko Kawauchi's work. I will never say that I want to follow her tracks, but my project is about the same thing : capturing the beauty of our world, in little, fragile, colored frangments.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I tried to realize this with a digital camera, but working with a Rolleiflex is a totally different experience. First of all, you don't look into the viewfiender and take your picture; you have to head down in front of your subject. You have to physically detach yourself from the subject you want to photograph, in order to compose and focus. For me, it's mentally showing respect to your subject, even if it's a building.</div>
<div>Second of all, you don't use digital instruments. You don't even use 24x36 films ! You use 120 films, which produce 12 6x6 great quality pictures. With this quality, you can print huge pictures without altering the quality.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As you can see, my project is very specific, but it's, in my sense, a great project to which you can participate. I have a lot of things to say, but money is always the factor keeping my away from my dreams.</div>
<div>If you want to see my ""commercial"" work, you can visit my web page at <a href=""http://www.photohorscadre.e-monsite.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.photohorscadre.e-monsite.com</a><br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is this project about ?</h3>
<p>My original goal is 1500€. It was calculated on the basis of 3 big axes :</p>
<p>- The camera maintenance</p>
<p>- The purchase and the development of the films</p>
<p>- The prints</p>
<p>The camera maintenance is important to have nice, well-exposed pictures. As it is old, I will need to revise all its little pieces, and I can't do it myself!</p>
<p>The purchase of the films is, itself, pretty expensive. Every film costs 8€ (I buy the Kodak Portra 400 or 800 in order to have the smallest grain and great, vibrating colors), the development is 12€, and the scanning of each films is another 12€.</p>
<p>The prints are pretty expensive, as each print will cost me around 20€. As I aim a total of 20 -nice- pictures in order to have a consistent set of images, the total for only the prints will be nearly half the total of the project !</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>And what do you get ? Well, I was just about to say it !</p>
<p>If you believe in me and my work, I believe as well in you and the things you fight for. This is why, for every Euro you give to my project, I will give a percentage to the NGO of your choice. It can be to fight cancer, to help communities access water in Togo, or to protect the marine turtles, everything you want ! Please see the ""contributions"" panel in order to see how much I will give.</p>
<p>And if I don't have the full 1500€, well, I will still use the money to start the project ! I might finish it a bit later, since I will have to find other sources, but it will still be my only aim !</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>YOU will make the difference.</p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p>Because without your financial support, young artists like me won't be able to be discovered, to participate in contests and exhibitions, etc.</p>
<p>With your help,  I will have enough money to present a wide variety of pictures to every gallery I will solicit, every contest I will try, every agent I will send an e-mail to. And, most of all, I will see that you, people, like what I do and that I can continue my work with your help !</p>

I would love to go further and further, and send some of my work to other contests and galleries !</p>
</div></div>","At a glance...
My name is Ambre, I'm 27 years old and I really am passionate about photography. This is why since last year, I'm a student in a photography school in the north of France. Before that, I had the opportunity to be a professional photographer in Canada during 2 years. I learned a lot, but being a professional is not the same as being an artist ! This is why I slightly changed my way, and began this Bachelor in Photography. Now, I learn how to express myself in other ways, and I have found mine.
 
Unfortunately for me, it's a pretty expensive way...
 
I am fond of film photography, especially color. This is why I have recently bought a Rolleiflex, a 1959 camera, which uses unusual films. It's a great camera, which produces high quality pictures. The quality that I want and need for my project.
 
I love the Japanese poetry in photography, especially Rinko Kawauchi's work. I will never say that I want to follow her tracks, but my project is about the same thing : capturing the beauty of our world, in little, fragile, colored frangments.
 
I tried to realize this with a digital camera, but working with a Rolleiflex is a totally different experience. First of all, you don't look into the viewfiender and take your picture; you have to head down in front of your subject. You have to physically detach yourself from the subject you want to photograph, in order to compose and focus. For me, it's mentally showing respect to your subject, even if it's a building.
Second of all, you don't use digital instruments. You don't even use 24x36 films ! You use 120 films, which produce 12 6x6 great quality pictures. With this quality, you can print huge pictures without altering the quality.
 
As you can see, my project is very specific, but it's, in my sense, a great project to which you can participate. I have a lot of things to say, but money is always the factor keeping my away from my dreams.
If you want to see my ""commercial"" work, you can visit my web page at www.photohorscadre.e-monsite.com


What is this project about ?
My original goal is 1500€. It was calculated on the basis of 3 big axes :
- The camera maintenance
- The purchase and the development of the films
- The prints
The camera maintenance is important to have nice, well-exposed pictures. As it is old, I will need to revise all its little pieces, and I can't do it myself!
The purchase of the films is, itself, pretty expensive. Every film costs 8€ (I buy the Kodak Portra 400 or 800 in order to have the smallest grain and great, vibrating colors), the development is 12€, and the scanning of each films is another 12€.
The prints are pretty expensive, as each print will cost me around 20€. As I aim a total of 20 -nice- pictures in order to have a consistent set of images, the total for only the prints will be nearly half the total of the project !
 
And what do you get ? Well, I was just about to say it !
If you believe in me and my work, I believe as well in you and the things you fight for. This is why, for every Euro you give to my project, I will give a percentage to the NGO of your choice. It can be to fight cancer, to help communities access water in Togo, or to protect the marine turtles, everything you want ! Please see the ""contributions"" panel in order to see how much I will give.
And if I don't have the full 1500€, well, I will still use the money to start the project ! I might finish it a bit later, since I will have to find other sources, but it will still be my only aim !


The impact
YOU will make the difference.
Why ?
Because without your financial support, young artists like me won't be able to be discovered, to participate in contests and exhibitions, etc.
With your help,  I will have enough money to present a wide variety of pictures to every gallery I will solicit, every contest I will try, every agent I will send an e-mail to. And, most of all, I will see that you, people, like what I do and that I can continue my work with your help !


Other ways to help
You might can't contribute to this project, but you still can help !
You can :
- Visit my website at www.photohorscadre.e-monsite.com and like me on facebook !

<p>
</p>
<p>My name is JoAnna Brownrigg. I am a photographer, living and working in Seattle, WA. My primary area of focus is portraiture. I'm a graduate of Cornish College of the Arts, where I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts. I am a member of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. Our homeland is located in the northeastern part of the state. We have no reservation, however we have a tribal headquarters and several office locations around the area. I will be traveling to my tribal headquarters in Niobrara, NE from March 22-29, 2015. My colleague and friend Sarah Ricci is also joining me, serving as my photographer's assistant and videographer. Sarah is a filmmaker and editor with almost ten years experience. My goal is to begin a photography project that will serve as a exploration and celebration of my native heritage.</p>
<p>My maternal grandfather served as my first exposure to my ancestry. He was born on Ponca land in Nebraska and held the ability to speak the Ponca language. I was very close to my grandfather. Growing up he would make me fry bread and share stories with me. When I was a eighteen he passed away. His spirit has always stayed with me. Growing stronger with each passing year. My whole life I have struggled to find my native identity. I did not feel like I belonged because I have fair skin, blonde hair, and green eyes. Unfortunately our western culture possesses a stereotypical image of what a person of native descent looks like. Inside I felt native but on the outside I didn't. People still look at me funny when I tell them I am Native American, but it doesn't bother me anymore; my connection to the land and to my people is strong. I hope to keep strengthening it by doing this project. Recently I found the courage to reach out to tribal officials and I was honored to receive their permission to start this project. </p>
<p>My goal is to meet with other tribal members and share stories, traditions and make meaningful long-lasting connections. Some of the topics I will be exploring: tribal future, sovereignty, preservation of culture, projects (education trail) and programs (tribal youth reconnection program, etc..). Two important questions I will be asking: How does termination continue to effect the tribe, and how does one navigate being a Ponca in 2015? This is a project that needs time to develop, so my hope is to travel back to Nebraska periodically over the years. Ultimately showing the photographs locally and nationally in a gallery type setting. </p>
<p>I would like to share a quote with you that has had quite a lot of impact on me. It has given me great strength recently. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This journey is extremely close to my heart. I feel so proud to be Ponca. With this project I hope to share my pride with a large audience, from all backgrounds. Your kind donation will help make that possible. Thank you for letting me share my story with you. I hope to show you more in the future! </p>

<h3>What Is This All About? </h3>
<p>Mystery Spot Books is a collaborative artist book publishing imprint by artist Chad Rutter and scholar Emily Roehl. The Energy Landscapes of St. Louis is a project that we began during a residency at St. Louis non-profit art center The Luminary. Through this project, we take our desire to engage with issues of energy production and climate change and ground it in a particular place: the St. Louis region. Besides being at the confluence of three major rivers, St. Louis is also the point at which a complex web of energy companies, power plants, geological features, waste sites, communities, and area histories connect. </p>
<p>During our stay in the Gateway City, we worked with local photographer and Washington University professor Jennifer Colten. Over the last several years, Colten has photographed post-industrial sites throughout the area. Together, we conceived of the book <i>Flood Plain Color Field</i>, which explores a part of our energy consumption process typically unseen by the public, the residual monuments of energy waste that accumulate in the flood plains of rivers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Is This Important? </h3>
<p>Now, more than ever, artists, writers, and other cultural creators need to illuminate the environmental realities of the people and places most affected by climate change and energy production. This book draws attention to one such site across the Mississippi River from downtown St. Louis, which hosts a decommissioned power plant and coal ash mound. By engaging with this landscape through photography, design, and writing, we want to draw attention not only to the histories of extraction in the region but to the persistent waste products that affect the health of human and ecological communities. </p>
<p>As a standalone project, this book helps expose a wider audience to the work of Jennifer Colten and Mystery Spot Books. As the next edition in the Energy Landscapes series, this book is part of Mystery Spot's template for future work in other cities. Our vision is to grow this effort into an ongoing investigation of how a changing environment writ large can be understood aesthetically, historically, and materially in the landscapes of our everyday lives. Your help in funding this book will go a long way toward making this broader effort a reality.</p>
<h3>What Will The Funding Do? What Will I Get In Return?</h3>
<p>We've completed the shooting, designing, and writing components of our photobook, and now we're asking for $2500 to help us print a limited edition of <i>Energy Landscapes of St. Louis No. 3: Flood Plain Color Field</i>. Any funding over that goal will be used to help stage launch events in St. Louis, MO (where Jennifer lives), Minneapolis, MN (where Chad lives), and Austin, TX (where Emily lives).</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, depending on amount, you will get awesome Mystery Spot publications, and, of course, a fresh copy of <i>Flood Plain Color Field</i>. If you dig especially deep in the ol' couch cushions, there are other, special perks detailed to the right. Here are some examples of what you can get: </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm just a Russian girl who fell in love with figure skating several years ago and quickly discovered how much I loved taking photos at the events. Since then, I've been working hard to improve, visiting as many competitions as I can. Last season, I’ve been able to attend several events (including Lombardia Trophy 2018 and Rostelecom Cup 2018) as an official photographer. I've also upgraded my lens thanks to everyone who supported last year's campaign which was an overwhelming success. Most of all, I was happy to deliver both calendars and photos to so many people who seemed to really like it!</p>
<p>This season, I will have more opportunities for photography in an official capacity as well, but I still need to cover the travel &amp; housing expenses. That’s where you come in!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Goal and Your Rewards</h3>
<p>My main goal this season is to photograph at two Grand Prix events (GP France and Rostelecom Cup) and 1-2 Challenger events. Luckily, I live in Moscow, so I will only need help attending the other competitions, i.e. travelling and accomodation expenses.<br/>This is how the funding is going to be distributed:</p>
<p><br/>    •    I'm planning around 20k RUB for GP France and 20k RUB for Challengers (~630 USD).<br/>    •    Around 38k RUB (~600 USD) is what I'll need for printing the physical rewards.<br/>    •    Around 22k RUB (~350 USD) is going towards shipping.<br/>    •    About 5k RUB (~75 USD) + 25 USD (since I'm using a non-US bank account) will cover the platform fees.</p>

<p>As thanks for your contributions, I've prepared a range of rewards, including digital-only and physical! The highlights include:</p>
<p><br/>    •    <strong>figure skating calendars</strong> with my favourite photos from the past seasons and the dates of the most important competitions coming up this season<br/>    •    five <strong>special calendars</strong> dedicated to some popular skaters and my own favorite subjects: Yuzuru Hanyu, Shoma Uno, Wakaba Higuchi, Team Japan and Team Cricket Club<br/>    •    an option for you to create your own, <strong>custom calendar</strong> made of any photos I have!<br/>    •    your own special <strong>collection of photos</strong> of any skater or team participating at a competition I'm going to in 2019-2020 season (currently: Lombardia Trophy 2019, Grand Prix France 2019, Rostelecom Cup 2019, possibly more)<br/>    •    a bundle of five 10x15 <strong>photo cards</strong> with any photos of your choosing.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In case I don't reach my goal, I will still use the money to visit at least one of my planned competitions (probably GP France). I will still send out all the rewards, as well. I will continue to try and bring you the best photos I can, as much as I'm able to!</p>
<p><br/>This is my second campaign! Last year I successfully raised funds to afford a new lens and sent out <i>more than 40 calendars</i>, as well as other digital and physical rewards. I have a trusted printing company and a more streamlined process of producing the calendars, so I am confident we'll be able to do this!

<h3>概貌</h3>
<p>我是一名以专业摄影师为目标的、业余花样滑冰摄影师。我喜欢前往世界各地拍摄花样滑冰的相关照片，并把它们分享给大家。去年，我向不同国家的冰迷们寄出了40余本花滑日历。因此，今年我再次为大家带来独家的花滑日历，希望大家能帮助我前往更多的比赛进行拍摄。</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>短述</h3>
<p>我只是个在几年前爱上花样滑冰的普通俄罗斯女孩，随后，我很快发现自己很喜欢在观赛时为选手拍摄照片。从那以后，我尽可能地前往更多的赛事现场拍摄。上个赛季，我有幸以官方摄像师的身份前往了一些比赛（包括2018年的Lombardia Trophy和2018年的大奖赛俄罗斯站）。感谢大家去年对我的支持，我得以更新我的摄像头。更重要的是，我很高兴自己能够把日历和相片带给这么多喜欢他们的人！<br/>在新赛季中，我将有更多的机会拍摄专业的相片，但我仍然需要解决出行以及住宿的花费。因此，我在这里请求大家的帮助。</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> 我的目标以及大家的回报</h3>
<p>我这赛季的主要目标是前往两个大奖赛分站赛（法国站和俄罗斯站）以及1～2个挑战赛拍摄照片。幸运的是，因为我就住在莫斯科，所以我只需要解决前往（除俄罗斯站外）其他比赛的支出，例如旅行费和住宿费。以下是这次集资的细则：</p>
<ul>
<li>我需要大约20k卢布前往法国站，以及20k左右卢布前往挑战赛（～630美元）</li>
<li>大约38k卢布（～600美元）作为实体回报的印刷费</li>
<li>大约22k卢布（～350美元）作为实体回报的邮寄费</li>
<li>大约5k卢布（～75美元）+25美元（因为我使用的不是美国银行账户）的手续费</li>
</ul>
<p>为感谢大家的帮助，我准备了电子版的以及实体的各种回报！这其中包括：</p>
<ul>
<li>花滑日历：包括我从以往赛季中精心挑选的照片以及新赛季中，重要比赛的日期；</li>
<li>五种特别日历：包括人气选手以及一些我个人的偏爱：羽生结弦、宇野昌磨、樋口新葉、日本队以及蟋蟀俱乐部；</li>
<li>订制日历：大家可以从我的照片中任意选择图片；</li>
<li>照片集：2019-2020赛季中、任何参与到我会前往的比赛中的、选手或团队的照片（目前包括：2019年大奖赛法国站、俄罗斯站以及Lombardia Trophy，之后可能会有追加）；</li>
<li>照片卡：5张，尺寸10*15，可以任意选择图片；</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>风险&amp;挑战</h3>
<p>即使集资没有达到我预设的目标，我也仍然会用这些钱前往至少一个我计划中的比赛（也许会是法国站）。我也仍然会寄出给大家的回报。我会继续尽可能地为大家带来更多的好照片！<br/>这是我的第二个项目！去年，我成功集资更新了新的摄像头，并且寄出了40+的相册以及其余的电子/实体回报。我认识一个可靠的印刷公司，并会通过更加快捷而高效低制作日历，因此我有信心我们能够达成目标的！我会在评论区以及推特上回复大家的各种问题。</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I'm just a Russian girl who fell in love with figure skating several years ago and quickly discovered how much I loved taking photos at the events. Since then, I've been working hard to improve, visiting as many competitions as I can. Last season, I’ve been able to attend several events (including Lombardia Trophy 2018 and Rostelecom Cup 2018) as an official photographer. I've also upgraded my lens thanks to everyone who supported last year's campaign which was an overwhelming success. Most of all, I was happy to deliver both calendars and photos to so many people who seemed to really like it!
This season, I will have more opportunities for photography in an official capacity as well, but I still need to cover the travel & housing expenses. That’s where you come in!
 

My Goal and Your Rewards
My main goal this season is to photograph at two Grand Prix events (GP France and Rostelecom Cup) and 1-2 Challenger events. Luckily, I live in Moscow, so I will only need help attending the other competitions, i.e. travelling and accomodation expenses.This is how the funding is going to be distributed:
    •    I'm planning around 20k RUB for GP France and 20k RUB for Challengers (~630 USD).    •    Around 38k RUB (~600 USD) is what I'll need for printing the physical rewards.    •    Around 22k RUB (~350 USD) is going towards shipping.    •    About 5k RUB (~75 USD) + 25 USD (since I'm using a non-US bank account) will cover the platform fees.
 
As thanks for your contributions, I've prepared a range of rewards, including digital-only and physical! The highlights include:
    •    figure skating calendars with my favourite photos from the past seasons and the dates of the most important competitions coming up this season    •    five special calendars dedicated to some popular skaters and my own favorite subjects: Yuzuru Hanyu, Shoma Uno, Wakaba Higuchi, Team Japan and Team Cricket Club    •    an option for you to create your own, custom calendar made of any photos I have!    •    your own special collection of photos of any skater or team participating at a competition I'm going to in 2019-2020 season (currently: Lombardia Trophy 2019, Grand Prix France 2019, Rostelecom Cup 2019, possibly more)    •    a bundle of five 10x15 photo cards with any photos of your choosing.
 
Risks & Challenges
In case I don't reach my goal, I will still use the money to visit at least one of my planned competitions (probably GP France). I will still send out all the rewards, as well. I will continue to try and bring you the best photos I can, as much as I'm able to!

<p>MY EIGHT-YEAR INTERNATIONAL PHOTO PROJECT WAS GALLERY AND MUSEUM BOUND WHEN A THIEF STRUCK. NOW IT'S DEAD IN THE WATER.  PLEASE HELP ME REPLACE LOST PHOTO GEAR.</p>
<p>WHO I AM</p>
<p>I am John Crosley, an amateur photographer mostly for 40 years.</p>
<p>Long ago I worked for Associated Press and magazines.   I photographed the Viet Nam war dodging bullets and mortars, photographed President Nixon, illustrated news stories, and shot photos of famous people at one time, in my 20s.</p>
<p>My photo work now is strictly amateur.  I do it for love of what I do.</p>
<p>I once worked with Pulitzer greats, but no matter how you sliced it, it was a job.</p>
<p>I take photos now for the love of photography; I haven't worked as a professional for over 35 years.</p>
<p>I did this on advice after a meeting with photo great Henri Cartier-Bresson in San Francisco.  His gave me good advice. I since have photographed for love of what I do, never as a job.</p>
<p>No one can tell me what photos to take or how to take them.  I have no one to please but my own artistic sensibilities.   My work is in a special photo trust for safekeeping, not sale, and for eventual exhibition and related use.</p>
<p>I have not sold my work for many years -- if I ever do, it will be through my trust and galleries.</p>
<p>THE PROJECT</p>
<p>I have been involved for most of the past decade on a project to document in interesting and artistic ways lives of people in Eastern Europe -- primarily Ukraine and Russia -- and contrast in photos those lives with similar photos of people in the United States. </p>
<p>The photo work is about 2/3 finished, but disaster struck and halted my project; a thief stole all my photo gear.</p>
<p>MY REPUTATION</p>
<p>My work is known by many photo aficionados worldwide,  There have been tens of millions of 'views' of my photos on the Internet - maybe even a hundred milllion views or more.</p>
<p>Blogs worldwide link to my posted work.</p>
<p>I post on four sites:</p>
<p>Photo.net</p>
<p>FLICKR</p>
<p>Photocritiq.com</p>
<p>Photobucket.com</p>
<p>Here is a link to 80 representative photos on FLICKR (mature viewers only, please)</p>

<div> </div>
<div>THE PROJECT OF MY PASSION THAT THEFT INTERRUPTED<br/><p>I have been passionately involved in my self-assigned and self-funded international photography project for the past eight years.  </p>
<p>That project has been the love of my life.</p>
<p>The loss was uninsured.</p>
<p>That theft broke my heart.</p>
<p>This project is my 'family', and it seems like I am losing a family member.</p>
<p>If some of my basic high grade photo equipment is not replaced, I must give up my gallery-bound and museum-bound photo project, and my last eight years' work will seem largely wasted which to me is unthiunkable.</p>
<p>It has been the reason I get up in the morning and go to bed at night, -- those nights I don't stay up all night working on this project.</p>
<p>I've posted here a gallery of over 50 representative photos for you to look at and evaluate.  I hope you find them interesting and viewable.</p>
<p>In my photo trust I have built an archive of over a half million photos, now waiting curating, then I hope exhibition. </p>
<p>My work is followed by hundreds or thousands of photographers and aficionados   worldwide.</p>
<p>When I post a photo on the Internet a few hundred to as many as a quarter million people might see any particular photo, just on one site where I post.</p>
<p>On one Internet photo site with 800,000+ registered members, I'm named among the top 50 'most interesting' members.  There are just shy of 16,000 comments tallied under my photos on that site. (including mine in reply)</p>
<p>HOW THE LOSS HAPPENED</p>
<p>I once was pretty well off; now I live on a small fixed income.</p>
<p>I used my money to self-finance my project including buying some of the world's  best photo equipment. </p>
<p>I sold my seaside house in California to finance this project.</p>
<p>One day after traveling 4 days, 12,000 miles, and visiting eight cities on two continents, I arrived on the West Coast at a major airport.</p>
<p>I grabbed a cab in a fatigued stupor, and asked to be taken to a car I kept in an economy parking area nearby.</p>
<p>The cab driver saw my stupor and my nodding off, put my bags, including my bulging camera bags loaded with expensive gear, into his trunk and off we went.</p>
<p>We arrived at my car, and while I drowsed on his front seat, he offered to transfer the bags to my car trunk.</p>
<p>I paid, thanked him, and drove off to a motel.</p>
<p>Later, a long ways away and the next day, I opened my car trunk and the bags with bulging with pro grade cameras, lenses and other photo equipment were not there. </p>
<p>The trunk had not been tampered with. </p>
<p>Thinking it might have been a mistake, I called the cab company on the receipt the cabbie had given me; the card he gave me belonged to a cab drive who had been deported and was of a different race the cab company told me.</p>
<p>It sunk in -- I had been stolen from.  The dispatcher said 'you ain't never gonna see your stuff again'.</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>Fingerprints could not be lifted off the card; my hands had smuged them.  It was a 'borrowed' card, used as a ruse.</p>
<p>'MAKING DO' WON'T WORK</p>
<p>I've tried to borrow a camera and 'make do' but without high quality equipment, no matter how hard I try, the image quality is not good enough for exhibition in galleries and museums, which is my target. </p>
<p>The owner of the borrowed camera also wants it back.</p>
<p>I soon will be entirely camera-less and cannot afford another, let alone two of the high quality cameras I need plus at least three professional lenses.</p>
<p>Much, much more was stolen, but I do not expect to 'get whole' here with this solicitation, just get enough for my basic needs.</p>
<p>Galleries and museums require highest image quality for their exhibited images, and that means photos I produce must be highest quality made with top notch professional equipment with no excuses.</p>
<p>I am asking now for just enough to get my project going again, keeping account my goal is to produce highest quality photos for exhibition, not just on the Internet but printed LARGE and for galleries and museums, to be viewed I hope well  beyond my lifetime.</p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN HELP</p>
<p>Taking photos intended to be exhibited hopefullly for hundreds of years and to be a part of history requires special care and special equipment.   It's not cheap but this time I promise never to let my hands off my gear. </p>
<p>Lenses need large apertures for maximum light gathering in dim light plus sharpness and greatest resolving power, with vibration reduction where appropriate to get the best chance at the next-to-impossible shot.  </p>
<p>I need equipment that works well while I try and often get the 'impossisible photo' under most trying circumstances.   I do well under most adverse conditions -- rain, snow, fog, wind, near darkness AND I OFTEN GET THAT SHOT.  I cannot do that if equipment is not top notch.</p>
<p>An assortment of three pro lenses from widest angle to telephoto is needed for the way I shoot.  That's a minimal but workable requirement.  I am a very heavy, varied, and productive shooter. </p>
<p>I'll be happy, however with whatever your generosity brings me with no hard feelings no matter what this campaign produces.  Bless anyone generous enough to give anything or even consider it.</p>
<p>To be worthy, a camera should be capable of taking a number of frames per second to capture the 'just so' moment, and also be compatible with all lenses made by the manufacturer.  It should have a very sensitive sensor for low light shooting and be pro rugged; I'm often in crowds or in tough situations.  Rain, ice and snow will ground non pro grade cameras, and I shoot in worst weather conditions.</p>
<p>I prefer and know Nikon equipment and know how to adjust it 'on the fly', rapidly, which is required for the way I shoot, and I'd prefer Nikon equipment.  I'd consider other brands.</p>
<p>I shoot quickly -- often within a fraction of a second --very often in lowest light, even frequently at night.  I get to know my equipment and explore the furthest bounds of its capabilities.  That's the magic of the best equipment; it produces under the harshest circumstances when no one expects that a photo can be produced, and sometimes those photos can be stunning.</p>
<p>Although I lost several cameras, just the Nikon D3s, costs well over $3,500.  Each pro lens costs between $1,000 to $2,500.  I addition, I lost a Canon pro video camera that costs about $3,500.</p>
<p>POSTING AND REPOSTING BY YOU WILL HELP TOO</p>
Link this site to your FaceBook account, post it to your Tumblr, Tweet it up, or e-mail it to your friends in support of my project if you can, and I'll be ever so grateful --  every little bit helps. 
<p>SUBJECT OF A DOCUMENTARY</p>
<p>I was subject of a documentary in the making last year that emphasized my shooting and street techniques, and it may start up again if it gets the funding.  That project is on hiatus now while the producer seeks additional funds.</p>
<p>I used their equipment during filming preparations, but it was a poor fit, unfamiliar, and their cameras and lenses no longer are available to me in any case.</p>
<p>I now live on a subsistence, fixed income and cannot afford replacements.</p>
<p>WHAT I NEED TO CONTINUE MY PROJECT</p>
<p>I usually carry two cameras, one high end camera. a digital SLR pro grade camera carrying a wide angle to moderate angle zoom of professsional caliber for working 'in close' with people and crowds.  </p>
<p>Highest quality requires I shoot FX (full frame) instead of DX (crop sensor).</p>
<p>At the same time, I generally carry a second high end SLR professioanl camera, this one with a large, heavy and super high quality 70-200 mm Vibration Reduction f. 2.8 zoom telephoto which is essential for some of my very best shots in low light. </p>
<p>The majority of those shots in the gallery here would not have been possible if I had ordinary, consumer equipment.  (See photos in gallery attached)</p>
<p>The longer zoom lens allows me to shoot from farther away and also 'compress' subjects to make intersting juxtapositions.</p>
<p>I use a third, mid-range, zoom with a large aperture, interchangeably, on one or the other camera, and so also need a middle range zoom, good enough to use on a full-format (FX) camera, for portraits and mid-range photos -- in this case a 24-70 mm f 2.8 zoom, of highest quality glass.</p>
<p>Museums and galleries have no need these days to show or acquire work made with equipment which is less than the absolute best or which produces less than stellar image quality.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO</p>
<p>Please help me replace some small part of my stolen photo equipment so I can continue my nearly decade-long project, tell the very interesting and artful stories that my photos tell, and hopefully have my photos end up in galleries and museums worldwide.</p>
<p>MY PHOTOS ARE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY ALREADY IN PARTS OF THE WORLD</p>
<p>I think in Russia and Ukraine already my images of daily life are considered by some aficionados a part of their contemporary history and culture. </p>
<p>There, I'm a very well known photographer, especially in Ukraine, Europe's largest country.  Regrettably times in Ukraine are very tough; average wages are about $100 a month for many.  Ukrainians are generous and would be natural donors, but few have more than subsistence income or even credit cards to donate with, so as an American I must look to Americans and first world country photographers and philanthropist to aid my quest.</p>
<p>I BELIEVE IN MY OWN WORK AND HAVE 'PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS'</p>
<p>To fund my project, I  sold my California seaside home and have been taking photos world wide since.  Funds have dried up with the ecoonomy, and now with this theft, I've suffered a huge loss I cannot overcome. </p>
<p>I am handicapped somewhat, but not enough to prevent me from doing this work.</p>
<p>This work identifies me to much of the photographic community. </p>
<p>Some photographers even write of a 'Crosley photograph' when they see my work because, they say, much of  my work is distinctive and identifiable to me.</p>
<p>Help return me to the streets of Seattle, Portland, San Francisco Los Angeles, and elsewhere in the US plus Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, Lvov and elsewhere in Ukraine then Moscow and other places in Russia, taking artful,, insightful, one-of-a-kind,  hopefully INTERESTING and often socially aware photos for my project.</p>
<p><br/>It is a project that may end up not only in photo archives but in history books as a reminder of contemorary culture at the outset of the 21st Century in Europe and the USA.</p>
<p>The project has the ultimate goal of showing contrasting cultures and showcasing those contrasts in photo books, galleries, texts and museums.</p>
<p>I have made it my life's work.</p>
<p><br/>Will you help return me to that work, please?  I would be so grateful.</p>
<p>CRITICS PRAISE MY WORK</p>
<p>One prominent critic, a Lucie Award winner (Photography's highest award), told me three years ago that when my project was ready, he would help me at no charge get my work into world class gallleries and museums, many run by his friends and colleagues -- the giltterati of the photo exhibition world.</p>
<p>He offered; I didn't ask. </p>
<p>Regrettably he's now disabled and unavailable.</p>
<p>My passion has eaten through my savings, but I have in return one half million photos in the Crosley photo trust waiting to be curated and the best exhibited, but the project is not ready for that yet.  The project is halted now indefinitely until I can continue shooting.</p>
<p>Replacement equipment and funds are also bound to be placed in that trust.</p>
<p>Luckily, to carry my work to completion, I need to replace only a small part of my enormous loss.</p>
<p>WHERE YOU CAN FIND MY WORK</p>

<div>In addition to the four Internet sites above, so many blogs I've lost count also feature my photos.  Sometimes Google lists all my photos, remarks, references and references by others on pages and pages of listings -- when they do that it takes about 100 Google pages at ten listings to the page to do the listing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also need a high end, three sensor Canon video camera.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>PRIZE WINNING</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My work is prize winning; I won the 'Blue Chip' Award for outstanding journalism with my photos at one time. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My photos have won other prizes as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm an amateur, not a pro; I'm not for hire and have not been a pro in recent memory. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A FAMILIAR FACE ON TWO CONTINENTS</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've become a familiar person on the streets in certain areas of Los Angele, also in  Portland, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle as well as Kiev, Dnipropetrovs, Lvov, and Odessa, Ukraine, as I search for telling photos that show 'ordinary people' doing sometimess extraordinary  and/or surreal things, and sometimes just  being themselves in interesting, surreal,  unusual, and often very INTERESTING and artful ways.</div>
<div>
<p>HELP ME CONTINUE MY PROJECT</p>
<p>Please help me continue my project - the love of my life -- my one great passion.</p>
Please help me get quality replacement equipment, so I can continue my life work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I live on an extremely limited income and could never hope to replace this equipment without donations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please help!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>IF THE GOAL IS EXCEEDED</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If my goal is exceeded, thank you for your generosity!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Any excess is expected to be dedicated to financing this project, with any extra used both to make archival quality prints for exhibition and to acquire more needed equipment, all in trust.</div>
<div> </div>

THE PROJECT OF MY PASSION THAT THEFT INTERRUPTEDI have been passionately involved in my self-assigned and self-funded international photography project for the past eight years.  
That project has been the love of my life.
The loss was uninsured.
That theft broke my heart.
This project is my 'family', and it seems like I am losing a family member.

HOW THE LOSS HAPPENED
I once was pretty well off; now I live on a small fixed income.
I used my money to self-finance my project including buying some of the world's  best photo equipment. 
I sold my seaside house in California to finance this project.
One day after traveling 4 days, 12,000 miles, and visiting eight cities on two continents, I arrived on the West Coast at a major airport.
I grabbed a cab in a fatigued stupor, and asked to be taken to a car I kept in an economy parking area nearby.
The cab driver saw my stupor and my nodding off, put my bags, including my bulging camera bags loaded with expensive gear, into his trunk and off we went.
We arrived at my car, and while I drowsed on his front seat, he offered to transfer the bags to my car trunk.
I paid, thanked him, and drove off to a motel.
Later, a long ways away and the next day, I opened my car trunk and the bags with bulging with pro grade cameras, lenses and other photo equipment were not there. 
The trunk had not been tampered with. 
Thinking it might have been a mistake, I called the cab company on the receipt the cabbie had given me; the card he gave me belonged to a cab drive who had been deported and was of a different race the cab company told me.
It sunk in -- I had been stolen from.  The dispatcher said 'you ain't never gonna see your stuff again'.
He was right.
Fingerprints could not be lifted off the card; my hands had smuged them.  It was a 'borrowed' card, used as a ruse.
'MAKING DO' WON'T WORK
I've tried to borrow a camera and 'make do' but without high quality equipment, no matter how hard I try, the image quality is not good enough for exhibition in galleries and museums, which is my target. 
The owner of the borrowed camera also wants it back.

HOW YOU CAN HELP
Taking photos intended to be exhibited hopefullly for hundreds of years and to be a part of history requires special care and special equipment.   It's not cheap but this time I promise never to let my hands off my gear. 
Lenses need large apertures for maximum light gathering in dim light plus sharpness and greatest resolving power, with vibration reduction where appropriate to get the best chance at the next-to-impossible shot.  
I need equipment that works well while I try and often get the 'impossisible photo' under most trying circumstances.   I do well under most adverse conditions -- rain, snow, fog, wind, near darkness AND I OFTEN GET THAT SHOT.  I cannot do that if equipment is not top notch.
An assortment of three pro lenses from widest angle to telephoto is needed for the way I shoot.  That's a minimal but workable requirement.  I am a very heavy, varied, and productive shooter. 
I'll be happy, however with whatever your generosity brings me with no hard feelings no matter what this campaign produces.  Bless anyone generous enough to give anything or even consider it.
To be worthy, a camera should be capable of taking a number of frames per second to capture the 'just so' moment, and also be compatible with all lenses made by the manufacturer.  It should have a very sensitive sensor for low light shooting and be pro rugged; I'm often in crowds or in tough situations.  Rain, ice and snow will ground non pro grade cameras, and I shoot in worst weather conditions.
I prefer and know Nikon equipment and know how to adjust it 'on the fly', rapidly, which is required for the way I shoot, and I'd prefer Nikon equipment.  I'd consider other brands.

I used their equipment during filming preparations, but it was a poor fit, unfamiliar, and their cameras and lenses no longer are available to me in any case.
I now live on a subsistence, fixed income and cannot afford replacements.
WHAT I NEED TO CONTINUE MY PROJECT
I usually carry two cameras, one high end camera. a digital SLR pro grade camera carrying a wide angle to moderate angle zoom of professsional caliber for working 'in close' with people and crowds.

My passion has eaten through my savings, but I have in return one half million photos in the Crosley photo trust waiting to be curated and the best exhibited, but the project is not ready for that yet.  The project is halted now indefinitely until I can continue shooting.
Replacement equipment and funds are also bound to be placed in that trust.
Luckily, to carry my work to completion, I need to replace only a small part of my enormous loss.
WHERE YOU CAN FIND MY WORK

 You can use Google.com to find my name and link to my work.
 
Just search 'John  Crosley' and press 'enter'.
 
Also try 'John Crosley photographer'
 
'John Crosley photography'
 
'John Crosley comment'
 
'John Crosley work'
 
'John Crosley comment'
 
If you wish to see how I'm regarded in Ukraine and Russia, try
 
'Google.com.ru' (Russian Google) and enter my name.
 
In Ukraine:   'Google.com.ua'   and emter my name.
 
In addition to the four Internet sites above, so many blogs I've lost count also feature my photos.  Sometimes Google lists all my photos, remarks, references and references by others on pages and pages of listings -- when they do that it takes about 100 Google pages at ten listings to the page to do the listing.
 
I also need a high end, three sensor Canon video camera.
 
PRIZE WINNING
 
My work is prize winning; I won the 'Blue Chip' Award for outstanding journalism with my photos at one time. 
 
My photos have won other prizes as well.
 
I'm an amateur, not a pro; I'm not for hire and have not been a pro in recent memory. 
 
A FAMILIAR FACE ON TWO CONTINENTS
 
I've become a familiar person on the streets in certain areas of Los Angele, also in  Portland, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle as well as Kiev, Dnipropetrovs, Lvov, and Odessa, Ukraine, as I search for telling photos that show 'ordinary people' doing sometimess extraordinary  and/or surreal things, and sometimes just  being themselves in interesting, surreal,  unusual, and often very INTERESTING and artful ways.

HELP ME CONTINUE MY PROJECT
Please help me continue my project - the love of my life -- my one great passion.
Please help me get quality replacement equipment, so I can continue my life work.
 
I live on an extremely limited income and could never hope to replace this equipment without donations.
 
Please help!
 
IF THE GOAL IS EXCEEDED
 
If my goal is exceeded, thank you for your generosity!  
 
Any excess is expected to be dedicated to financing this project, with any extra used both to make archival quality prints for exhibition and to acquire more needed equipment, all in trust.
 
With much thanks.

The Impact

There are ecological changes around the world as we speak.. For me it is fascinating and frightening that most of the
creatures that i capture with my camera in their natural environment  will
disappear for ever..My main concern is to have a large public database for the next
generations to come, in order for them to be able to acknowledge these unknown

I am also planning the creation of a non profit magazine for environmental
awareness and the publication of a book about insects. But since my country is in
a financial crisis, as you may probably know, it  will take a while in order to be able to
afford the printing costs.

because it is unusual and commendable to help complete strangers accomplish their dreams...2)Also, i have  quite a popular website  the 2 years I have shared my work and in which i

be presented. 3)If you prefer  a print, the
printed photos of your choice from my gallery will be mailed by post. Eitherwise,
you can send photos to be retouched by me and then sent back to you, in a

photos edited and printed from your photo session ..Thank you all in advance!

I have been awarded a scholarship by the International Center of Photography (ICP) to participate in a 2-week Bookmaking Masterclass this May with Sandra van der Doelen and Teun van der Heijden - the premiere photobook editors/designers around.</p><p>Those who know me well will have some idea of what this means. When I first arrived to Guatemala in June 2004 to work in the human rights field, it was supposed to be for one year.</p><p>Afterwards, I felt such a strong need to document what I had experienced that I came back in 2006 to start a documentary photography project – of which I knew nothing about. The idea was always to document two main issues: the post war processes, what has become “Life After Genocide”, and the conflicts between rural/indigenous communities and extractive industries. This latter project I’ve titled “This Land is Ours”.</p><p>Twelve years later, innumerable stumbling blocks and lots of support from friends, family and colleagues, I am still here. My goal was always to leave a visual testimony of these years that could at least attempt to complement the legacies of Jean-Marie Simon in the 80s and Jonathan Moller in the 90s/early 2000s. Huge task considering the amazing and historically priceless visual material they produced.</p><p>So, this workshop is a huge step in my attempt to achieve this goal. I believe the time is right to think about wrapping up these two projects, and perhaps even my time in Guatemala, in the near future. I also believe it is not too outlandish to think both projects could be combined into one book. Let’s see what the experts think…</p><p>Meanwhile, the realities of everyday life as a freelancer and a father are brutal. Getting the scholarship for the workshop is wonderful, but taking the time off work to do it is not. Hence, I am setting up a print sale in order to fund the extra US $1500 I need for materials, travel &amp; housing expenses.</p><p>I am offering 5x5 and 12x12 prints of my black and white photos from Guatemala. These are from the same series that won 1st place in the POY Latinamerica contest in 2015 - all taken with iPhones.</p><p>All images will be printed in a metallic paper. They look great!</p><p>I can’t thank Alison Morley enough for once again believing in my work. It means so much to receive this scholarship – my second one for an ICP masterclass.</p><p>Thank you everyone who has supported my work all these years and this is just one step closer to what seemed like an impossible dream in 2006.</p><p> </p><p>I am offering:</p><ul>

I have been awarded a scholarship by the International Center of Photography (ICP) to participate in a 2-week Bookmaking Masterclass this May with Sandra van der Doelen and Teun van der Heijden - the premiere photobook editors/designers around.Those who know me well will have some idea of what this means. When I first arrived to Guatemala in June 2004 to work in the human rights field, it was supposed to be for one year.Afterwards, I felt such a strong need to document what I had experienced that I came back in 2006 to start a documentary photography project – of which I knew nothing about. The idea was always to document two main issues: the post war processes, what has become “Life After Genocide”, and the conflicts between rural/indigenous communities and extractive industries. This latter project I’ve titled “This Land is Ours”.Twelve years later, innumerable stumbling blocks and lots of support from friends, family and colleagues, I am still here. My goal was always to leave a visual testimony of these years that could at least attempt to complement the legacies of Jean-Marie Simon in the 80s and Jonathan Moller in the 90s/early 2000s. Huge task considering the amazing and historically priceless visual material they produced.So, this workshop is a huge step in my attempt to achieve this goal. I believe the time is right to think about wrapping up these two projects, and perhaps even my time in Guatemala, in the near future. I also believe it is not too outlandish to think both projects could be combined into one book. Let’s see what the experts think…Meanwhile, the realities of everyday life as a freelancer and a father are brutal. Getting the scholarship for the workshop is wonderful, but taking the time off work to do it is not. Hence, I am setting up a print sale in order to fund the extra US $1500 I need for materials, travel & housing expenses.I am offering 5x5 and 12x12 prints of my black and white photos from Guatemala. These are from the same series that won 1st place in the POY Latinamerica contest in 2015 - all taken with iPhones.All images will be printed in a metallic paper. They look great!I can’t thank Alison Morley enough for once again believing in my work. It means so much to receive this scholarship – my second one for an ICP masterclass.Thank you everyone who has supported my work all these years and this is just one step closer to what seemed like an impossible dream in 2006. I am offering:
One 5x5 photograph: US $15
Set of two 5x5 photographs: US $25
Set of three 5x5 photographs: US $35
One 12x12 photograph: US $40
Set of two 12x12 photographs: US $70
Set of three 12x12 photographs: US $100
Shipping costs:
Guatemala: Free. I will hand deliver.
USA: US $5 flat regardless of how many prints are ordered.
Canada: US $8 flat free regardless of how many prints are ordered.
Europe: US $13 flat free regardless of how many prints are ordered.
Rest of World: US $16 flat free regardless of how many prints are ordered.

I created this campaign because I need your help to fund the deposit to produce the books.</p><p><strong>Why are you here? Why should you help this campaign?</strong></p><p>(if you already know, skip down past #5, otherwise continue and indulge!)</p><p>1.  <strong>LOVE.</strong> You love my work already, you love me, you love the people in my work. You desire to own my work in it's entirety in one little place for you to enjoy at your leisure. Imagine, you can pet each page, kiss them, sit on them, do whatever your heart desires with all my work! </p><p>2. <strong>CRAFT. </strong>You are a connoisseur of photography and appreciate the medium of analog photography, darkroom printing and black and white film. You desire to support a project in which every image was produced by hand, from the pre-limanery sketches, the crank of the Hasselblad and squeegeeing the final print in the darkroom. </p><p>3. <strong>SOUL. </strong>You seek an artist with intention. An artist that pours their soul into every detail of their work. You are tired of the mediocrity everywhere and open to an experience that may transport you to another world, that may bring you to tears, that may arouse you, that may terrify you and beyond... </p><p>4. <strong>AESTHETIC. </strong>Wallpapers from 1920's New Orleans, decaying abandoned schools, broken victorian dolls, old time beauty, rotting mental asylums... You want to find yourself in another world, each page rich with texture and nostalgia of another time and place. The comfort alone of escaping the modern world alone pushes you In Rooms. </p><p>5. <strong>INTELLECT. </strong>The study of the human mind, peering and probing deep inside the locked doors of our inner secrets excites you. You have an interest to observe the mind, splayed raw and open in front of you, to further your studies of the human condition. Perhaps you love Jungian Psychology, Jung's Shadow Work? This is the book for you!</p><p><strong>Will you join me In Rooms?</strong></p><p>Is it a dream, fantasy or nightmare?</p><p><i><strong>In Rooms Volume 2 (2016-2017)</strong>  </i>takes readers on an intimate and erotic psychological journey into the mind of identifying as a woman, investigating fear, desire, death, mental health, sexuality, love,  gender and identity. The story is deeply personal, created through the intense confrontation of my inner dialogue, shadow self, and minds of my subjects. While personal, it was my intention to tap into the collective unconscious in the hopes that the story is not my own, not 'hers', not all women, but each of ours. Through an observation of this pain, struggle, beauty &amp; resolution may we liberate our minds, find peace within ourselves and in the most simplest of pleasures, feel something, a sense of stimulation or joy in order to carry forward.   </p><p>In chronological order, accompanied with hand-written text, experience photography in a realm between literature and film, as a medium to communicate a surreal diary-like narrative. In the last section, readers experience an unpublished diary self portrait series with hand-written entries, sketches and contact sheets. This photo book provides viewers with the opportunity to juxtapose the artist's work with the artist's mind as a psychological study into creation of art and the human experience. </p><p><strong>In Rooms Artist Statement</strong> <a href=""http://inrooms.format.com/inroomsartiststatement"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></p><p><strong>Press on In Rooms</strong> <a href=""https://www.inroomsgallery.com/pages/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></p><p><strong>Social Media</strong> <a href=""http://instagram.com/in_rooms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></p><p><strong>Directed &amp; Printed by</strong> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/in_rooms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brittany Markert</a></p><p>The content of this book is a mixture of self portraiture and collaborative work.

Although Indian of origin, most are without any citizenship papers for either India or Nepal. The camp has been here for 20 years and houses about 50 families originally from Bihar, the Punjab, Delhi and Rajasthan. They came to Nepal to escape the hot desert, water and food shortages and looking for work and education amongst the cool mountain air. Unfortunately the reality was very different and the children that were born here were left with little choice but to stay. Hidden away, this community is almost unheard of and unknown in Kathmandu, falling between the cracks of the substantial amount of international aid that gets pumped into the city and for development projects across the country.</p>
<p><strong>We want to help them and we need your help</strong>. ‘We’ are Cinders and Azim, a couple from the UK who have been living and working in Nepal for the past 6 months. We arrived in Kathmandu with around 40 digital and film cameras and a hazy plan to run a participatory photography project of some kind (both of us are trained to run these projects by PhotoVoice UK). Introduced one day to one of the families living in the camp - seven charming brothers to be precise - we have since been visiting regularly, taking photographs, drinking sweet Indian chai, joining daily afternoon cricket matches on neighbouring scrubland. Getting to know these beautiful people and hearing their stories. Our hazy idea had found its home!</p>
<p><strong>What we will do - and what we need<br/></strong></p>
<p>We have created this page to gather immediate funds to bring some joy to these incredible children. Always smiling and playing with everything and anything - babies play with match boxes, toddlers tie bits of rope and chain to become snakes – they are amazingly creative.</p>
<p>We want to help this wonderful community in a simple way, by focusing on artistic expression and play. This is not a large scale development project, but rather a very personal idea borne of a strong connection to the people we've met and discussions with them about what they want and need. It's the everyday stuff, the fun and happiness that 'normal' kids have that all these families want for their children....and it is something that we <em>can</em> deliver in our time here. Not promising something we can't give or see through.<em><strong></strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participatory photography project</strong></li>
</ul><p>Twice weekly over the month of April we will run workshops with children in the camp - jointly facilitated by young adults living there. The children will be provided with and taught how to use a camera. Through the medium of photography we aim to give the children a chance to express themselves by taking photographs, and to work together on something creative and fun. We will produce and provide them with prints of their work, but the project will focus on the process as much as finished results.</p>
<p>The cost of this is not huge. We already have cameras kindly donated from the UK, we have the children to give them to, we just need funds to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print the pictures on a regular basis - the kids need their prints back immediately. Such an important part of this is building trust with the children and a schedule of twice weekly meetings throughout April must be stuck to and prints given back every time.</li>
<li>Purchase additional materials such as card, marker pens and glue for the workshops, and a book for each participant to mount their prints in.<em></em>
</li>
</ol><ul>
<li><strong>Cricket kit and arts-based toys</strong></li>
</ul><ol>
<li>Full-blooded games of cricket - played with hard red leather balls and typical subcontinental intensity - take place every afternoon on a piece of flat scrubland adjacent to the camp. These games bring immense happiness to otherwise gloomy days. Players from the camp have managed to accumulate most of what they need, but are still missing several key bits of kit - much of it protective! These can all be purchased locally in Kathmandu, but are too expensive. We'd love to help them - and it won't take much for them to have everything they need.</li>
<li>We'd also like to provide paper, paints and creative materials. I have seen first hand how the girls cherish one small pot of nail varnish or tube of henna. I know they would be the same with paints and art materials. We will incorporate some art into the workshops and teach them some techniques they can practise on their own.</li>
</ol><p>So you can see we are not trying to collect thousands, or even really hundreds. Just enough to develop their pictures and buy them some cricket kit and art materials/toys.  Even £2 from you with a quick and easy click would mean SO much to them….after the printing costs obviously the more money you can give the more supplies we can buy them but we are aiming for a starting target of <strong>$500</strong>.</p>
<p>We will update the photographs regularly as well as documenting the workshops and the kids in their cricket kit and with their cameras! We are in the process of creating a platform for these images which you will be able to access from this link.</p>
<p><strong>So that's it really...but please read on if you have time...</strong></p>
<p><em>We absolutely have to work with these families and photography</em>, already able to see what joy it will bring. Having a lot of disposable cameras as we do was always a worry for a participatory photography project…you would be amazed at the snazzy digital cameras even the poorest kids are playing with these days! But spending time with <em>these</em> families, knowing what <em>they</em> have to play with and seeing their reaction to handling prints we have given them we have NO DOUBT IN OUR MIND we must work with them and how valuable just this human contact is to the development of these incredible, but incredibly vulnerable, children.</p>
<p>We are on a short deadline and this definitely won’t be a textbook participatory photography project. This will be a series of visits about love and happiness, playing and creativity in a pretty challenging environment. We want to show them that they are important, valued and not forgotten. Having ownership of a camera, capturing their daily lives, their relationships, ‘their’ days is going to give them such a sense of importance, belonging, worth. But above and beyond all this it will make them happy.  They will smile, they will be being creative and they will have some very special photographic prints to keep as their own valuable possessions, when they have little others. The importance of this ownership of a seemingly valueless object in a humans feeling of self worth is well documented and immeasurable.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and for your support. </p>

I know they would be the same with paints and art materials. We will incorporate some art into the workshops and teach them some techniques they can practise on their own.
So you can see we are not trying to collect thousands, or even really hundreds. Just enough to develop their pictures and buy them some cricket kit and art materials/toys.  Even £2 from you with a quick and easy click would mean SO much to them….after the printing costs obviously the more money you can give the more supplies we can buy them but we are aiming for a starting target of $500.
We will update the photographs regularly as well as documenting the workshops and the kids in their cricket kit and with their cameras! We are in the process of creating a platform for these images which you will be able to access from this link.
So that's it really...but please read on if you have time...
We absolutely have to work with these families and photography, already able to see what joy it will bring. Having a lot of disposable cameras as we do was always a worry for a participatory photography project…you would be amazed at the snazzy digital cameras even the poorest kids are playing with these days! But spending time with these families, knowing what they have to play with and seeing their reaction to handling prints we have given them we have NO DOUBT IN OUR MIND we must work with them and how valuable just this human contact is to the development of these incredible, but incredibly vulnerable, children.
We are on a short deadline and this definitely won’t be a textbook participatory photography project. This will be a series of visits about love and happiness, playing and creativity in a pretty challenging environment. We want to show them that they are important, valued and not forgotten. Having ownership of a camera, capturing their daily lives, their relationships, ‘their’ days is going to give them such a sense of importance, belonging, worth. But above and beyond all this it will make them happy.  They will smile, they will be being creative and they will have some very special photographic prints to keep as their own valuable possessions, when they have little others. The importance of this ownership of a seemingly valueless object in a humans feeling of self worth is well documented and immeasurable.

<p>On 27th of May I will hang my photographs at the Strand Gallery in London for a week long exhibition that will mark the beginning of my career as a photographic artist.</p>
<p>That week will be my chance to speak to as many agents, galleries, critics, magazine editors and journalists as possible.</p>
<p>I have only four months to find the funds, print the photographs, get them framed and get the word out to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>And I will need your help to do all this.</p>
<h2>My work and background</h2>
<p>On my 18th birthday my father gave me a 24mm lens. That lens triggered a lifelong passion and to this day every photograph I take uses that lens.</p>
<p>For 22 years I have travelled the world, capturing precious moments and landscapes, all the while developing my own personal style and a significant body of work.</p>
<p>During that time the world of photography been transformed by the arrival of digital.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to digital photography, yet I remain unconvinced that it should ever replace the magic of the darkroom.</p>
<p>Despite the pressures to convert to digital my love and passion for analogue photography has continued to grow. The restrictions and apparent inconveniences of using film remain an integral part of my working style.<br/><br/>I still shoot in B&amp;W, always using Kodak T-MAX 400.</p>
<p>I print my own photographs, never cropping them. They are gimmick free, relying purely on the strength of their disrespectful composition, strong subject matter and broody atmosphere.</p>
<h2>So why exhibit now and what does the future hold?</h2>
<p>With iconic brands like Kodak facing bankruptcy, I am afraid that film, along with all the excitement and wonderment I experienced as a teenager, is at risk of becoming obsolete. Photography students, for example, will often go through their entire course without entering a darkroom.</p>
<p>It is time to celebrate the power of film, and I intend to get my work out there and use it to evangelise about what I believe in.</p>
<p>During the exhibition I will invite students and kids to come and talk to me so I can share the skills, knowledge and passion I've developed over those 22 years. Seeing darkroom prints and speaking directly to the photographer will, I hope, inspire the students and increase the likelihood of them developing skills in analogue photography.</p>
<p>The plan is for this exhibition to be the first in a series of shows and projects across the UK and Europe - I have already been approached about the possibility of taking it to Milan.</p>
<p>Once the images are printed and framed it will provide me with a base from which I can evolve and adapt the exhibition for future themes, venue requirements and new work.</p>
<p>I am currently working on two major photographic projects: 'West of the Sun', a collection of landscapes and 'Festivities', a look at traditional celebrations and festivals, both secular and non secular from around the world. I will be able to use the frames, contacts and momentum from this exhibition to work towards completing these two projects.</p>
<p>On top of this I am running an online writing and poetry <a href=""http://www.tobydeveson.com/competition.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">competition</a> - using my images as inspiration - which I am hoping will culminate in another exhibition.</p>
<p>Now that I have started on this mission, I will not be stopped.</p>
<h2>Your support</h2>
<p>The costs of producing an exhibition, as you can imagine, are sizeable: Venue hire, framing, photographic and darkroom materials, PR, communications, posters, invitations, catering, storage, transport - they all add up. And while I can, and will, invest some of my own cash, I just don’t have access to all of the resources I need.</p>
<p>The entire budget for the exhibition is $15000 or £10000 so your contributions will make up half the budget and I will cover the remainder myself.</p>
<p>It is important that the target budget is reached in order to ensure the exhibition fulfils all of its potential and promise. If my goal here is not reached, however I will do everything I can to ensure a scaled down version goes ahead, so rest assured, your contributions will not be wasted.</p>
<p>So -</p>
<p>If you like the photographs you have see here, the highlights of a 22 year obsession, and believe they should be shown...</p>
<p>or if you, like me, are passionate about the art of photography...</p>
<p>or believe that the purity and depth of film should be celebrated...</p>
<p>or want to make sure future generations have the chance to learn the craft of analogue photography...then please contribute now.</p>
<p>I have put together a whole range of fantastic rewards and benefits including prize draws, discounted original prints, sponsored prints, portfolio reviews and tuition sessions. They really do make it worth getting involved, so please, have a look.</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>This exhibition is not only an investment in my future as a photographic artist, but a celebration of the enduring power of film and photography - of a dying art as it attempts to resurrect itself.</p>
<p>I intend to play a part in this resurrection in whatever way I can and this exhibition is a perfect starting point and ideal platform.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>During the academic year of 2016-2017, Kennesaw State University is observing the Year of Russia. The campus of the University arranges special events on a regular basis, featuring a different country each year. Each of these events is dedicated to a certain country.</p>
<p>Kennesaw State University offers more than 150 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 35,000 students. It is one of the 50 largest public institutions in the country and the third-largest university in the state. The KSU draw students from throughout the region and from 92 countries across the globe.</p>
<p>Each year Kennesaw State University is organizing lectures and seminars  with  economists, political scientists, and historians for performance.  The goal is to share KSU students the culture and history of foreign countries. </p>
<p>Under the direction of Daniel J. Paracka, Ph.D. Director, Campus Internationalization Division of Global Affairs, Professor of Education, Interdisciplinary Studies Department of KSU the Year of Russia is part of an ongoing program featuring a different country each year.</p>
<p>For the Year of Russia Dr. Paracka  in partnership with premier Russian-language newspaper in Georgia, “The Russia House” is organizing a photography exposition  at KSU campus. According to his firm belief the visual arts are an integral part of a country’s culture.</p>
<p>Dr. Paracka has chosen 25 photographs of Oleg Koryagin. These photographs were taken in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other cities and towns of Russia, not so well-known and therefore they are of a particular interest.</p>
<p>This exhibition is meant to expose KSU students, even those not studying Russian culture and history, to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of these centuries old culture. This includes Russia’s enduring contributions to the arts, which are timeless and without borders.</p>
<p>We have all heard the saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words”. Photography is a powerful tool for visual information. Students, or anyone else for that matter, can easily appreciate a photographic representation of a culture more easily and with more appreciation beyond that provided only by lectures or textbooks. When that photography of different places and times is created by a professional, the impact of understanding a culture by young students can be more effectively presented and appreciated.</p>
<p>Since the project is non-profit, its implementation depends entirely on the effectiveness of a fundraising campaign. We are very optimistic and excited about the future and confident in prospects of our project. According to our estimates, the amount required for the organization of this exposition is $6,800.  </p>
<p>Oleg Koryagin has been a professional photographer for more than 30 years. Following his graduation from the Moscow State University, Department of Journalism, he was invited to work for the largest information agency in the Soviet Union, published both at home and in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, professional photographers know how to shoot in different genres and conditions. However each photographer has his/her own favorite subject, genre, and style. Having traveled a lot throughout the homeland and around the world, Oleg has created his own style in travel photography.</p>
<p>Oleg’s photography is not a travel guide but a collection of the author’s prints, sometimes unexpected but always impressive. Even the most popular routes trodden by tourists far and wide appear from a new angle in his works. This is the art of photography at its best!</p>
<p>Not surprising over 100 his photographs were presented at a solo exhibit in France in 2012. Later, some of these pictures accompanied by the text were published in California, in the almanac of Russian authors living in the USA.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>According to our calculation, the amount of an estimated $6,800 is enough for preparing and holding the exposition. This amount is distributed as follows:</p>
<p>Budget $6,864</p>
<p>Exposition: 25 printed large-scale and applied to plexi $150 each = $3,750</p>
<p>Hardware for Installation $25 each x 25 = $625                 </p>
<p>Additional texts printed for exhibition $350</p>
<p>Leaflet designed &amp; printed for exhibition $750           </p>
<p>Crating and shipping costs for exhibition $315</p>
<p>Indiegogo fees $624</p>
<p>Cost for Perks $450</p>
<p>Having taken the decision to look for the help of sponsorship, we will be happy to express our respect and gratitude to those who seem it possible to become our donors. For this, we provide several options. Each person who makes a donation to our fund will be mentioned on the list of sponsors. This list will be arranged on a banner at the opening of the exposition. In addition, we will send to our honorable sponsors the samples of Oleg Koryagin’s works as postcards, photographs printed on paper or canvas with a note of gratitude from the photographer. We will attach a brochure about KSU exposition, information about author, and list of all sponsors.</p>
<p>What happens with the donations, if we don’t collect the necessary amount? If the amount of money collected is not enough for preparing and holding of the exposition in the form we plan, we will simply reduce the number of photographs presented at the exhibition. In other words, if we are not able to print 25 photographs of 24x36 size, we will print 20… 17… 15… or even 10. No matter what happens, the exposition has to be held, and we will do our best to make it happen. We are sure that with your help we will be able to achieve our goal.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>Photography was invented almost 200 years ago. Due to the development of digital technology, it has become a total obsession. Having become available to the public, photography is still the art form. Organizing the exposition of photographer Oleg Koryagin, we are sure it will be interesting to Kennesaw State University students. This belief is based on the high quality work of the author, his talent, and ability to show the familiar and habitual images in a new way. Surely, we are encouraged by a large number of positive comments regarding the exhibition held in France, as well as the positive evaluation of his work among colleagues. Moreover, we are sure that students in fact always meet “new” with huge interest: new knowledge, new experience, especially if this “new” is presented in an exciting and vivid manner. Unique photographs about Russia, its history, culture, and Russia today will be seen not only by thousands of KSU students but by significantly more people who are interested in photography as the art.</p></div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>It's understandable that making a monetary contribution isn't always easy.

<p>In November 2015, I spent 15 days photographing the work Bright Kids Uganda and The Great Kings and Queens Children Centre are doing to support children in Uganda.  The East African nation is widely considered to be among the poorest and most
politically corrupt countries in the world. In this nation of almost 39 million
people, an infamous civil war waged by Joseph Kony's Lord’s Resistance Army has resulted
in tens of thousands of casualties, extreme torture and atrocities, and the
dislocation of more than a million people. Nearly half the population is under
the age of 15, and an estimated 2 million children have been orphaned.   <br/></p>
<p>Murray Horne, curator of visual arts for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, has invited me to present my photographs from Uganda at Gallery Liberty 937 opening on September 23, 2016. <br/></p>
<p>The<i> In Uganda, A School to Call Home </i> exhibit marks my first solo show since my 1998 Pulitzer Prize-winning essay <i>Trek of Tears</i>, which captured the tragedy of Rwandans and Burundians displaced by ethnic conflict. That collection of photographs traveled around the country and abroad for more than decade. </p>

</p>
<p>I was introduced to Bright Kids Uganda co-founder Victoria Nalongo Namusisi at the University of Pittsburgh by Dr. Lou Picard in 2012. Namusisi co-founded the school and orphanage 15 years ago after several successful careers as a sport journalist, Olympic track team coach, government official and the head of scouting in Uganda. </p>
<p>While in Uganda, Namusisi introduced me to former street kid Medi Bugembe who ran away from home when he was five years old.  Namusisi rescued Medi from the streets when he was 11-years-old. </p>
<p>Medi joined other children who
were neglected, orphaned or victims of extreme poverty at her newly opened Bright
Kids Uganda orphanage where he was enrolled in school and encouraged to find
his own path. After studying to become a
teacher, Medi opened his own orphanage and school, The Great Kings and Queens
Children's Centre, on the outskirts of Kampala. Many of the
children come from the same streets where he fought for survival. </p>
<p>Both projects I photographed—The Great Kings and Queens
Children’s Centre and Bright Kids Uganda— have a connection to the Pittsburgh community. Pittsburghers have supported these projects
financially and through educational outreach of the University Pittsburgh’s
Ford Institute for Human Security, a program of the university’s Graduate
School of Public and International Affairs (GSPIA). This exhibition is the culmination of a three-year planning process  and the willingness of the subjects to share their life stories with the world. </p>

</div><div>
<div>Producing a solo show is an extremely expensive burden for an artist and I don't want to miss this opportunity to share Victoria and Medi's stories with Pittsburghers and beyond. My goal is to raise $2500.00 to cover the production (printing and mounting the photographs) for my exhibit and to provide modest honorariums for my subjects Victoria Nalongo Namusisi and Medi Bugembe who are traveling to Pittsburgh from Uganda to participate in a community forum. </div>
<div>I hope contributors will take advantage of this unique opportunity to own one of my photographs. I have received some support from the Ford Institute for Human Security at University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public and International Affairs and a small Artist Opportunity Grant from the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council, but it is not enough to cover my expenses. </div>
<div>Master printer Tom Underiner, of Pixel River, is donating his expertise by creating limited edition prints for contributors at the $100, $250 and $500 levels. Hahnemühle, creator of beautiful fine art papers, has generously donated paper to our project. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Get</h3></div>
<div>As you can see, our perks are listed with the titles in Luganda, the local dialect spoken where Victoria and Medi live. In showcasing the beauty of these two strong and empowered individuals and their work through photography, it is also an opportunity to experience a unique world culture. Through learning bits of a new language, we hope to provide that connection to you, our backers.</div>
<div>In addition, those of you who back the campaign at select tiers BEFORE SEPTEMBER 12TH will have your name or the name of your business featured as event sponsors at the exhibit opening. Find out more in the descriptions below!</div>

<h4>[$500] Mukwano (muh-kwon-oh)</h4>
<div>Mukwano in Luganda means ""friendship"" and in supporting this campaign through backing the $500 tier, we cannot count you as anything but a great friend.

</div></div>","A Short Summary
My name is Martha Rial and I am independent photographer based in Pittsburgh. I have dedicated my 35-year career to photographing stories I believe are critical to understanding the human condition. I work hard to go
beyond the stereotype and find the joy in
the humanity that bonds us all.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>I graduated last summer with a degree in photography from Sheffield Hallam Photography, after which I spent a couple of months unemployed before taking a job au pairing in Paris for 6 months. Unfortunately since that has come to an end and I've returned to the UK there are just as few jobs around. I've got a job in a pub, but the hours vary from 30 hours one week to 8 hours the next, which leaves me financially stranded. Right now I'm unable to move back to Sheffield to find work because of being on an NHS waiting list (and I'd have to go back to the end of the queue if I moved again). <br/></p>
<p>So where does this leave me? Well, it leaves me in Bourne, Lincolnshire, living with my dad and his fiancée, with no car and very little in the way of job prospects. However! It's not all doom and gloom... Because on the weeks where I have very few shifts leaves me with plenty of ""free"" time. Which has led to me beginning several personal projects. Including mini-projects documenting local clubs, like the Scrabble club and the local Crown Green Bowling club, and a bigger project Bourne in general. As well as trying to continue my project about the Women's Institute nationwide. <br/></p>
</div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<h3>What is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money you donate would specifically buy a lighting kit (something I had previously borrowed from university, and didn't think that I'd miss so much!) which would make it possible to do the portrait sittings of the members of the WI, Crown Green Bowling club, and the Scrabble club. The light kit is also a fantastic general investment for me, which is why it is a priority. Secondly the money would help towards paying for a high quality printer, which would make it much cheaper and faster for me to produce high quality prints, which is very important! </p>
<p>The end result will be a local exhibition and an online gallery with prints available. I would like to exhibit further away but that is something that I would have to apply for further in to the project, but I will keep you posted!</p>
<p>Basically at the moment I have somewhere between 5 and 10 % of a project done... Your donation would make it possible for me to complete the project, the rest is legwork!<br/></p>

Including mini-projects documenting local clubs, like the Scrabble club and the local Crown Green Bowling club, and a bigger project Bourne in general. As well as trying to continue my project about the Women's Institute nationwide. 

What is Needed & What You Get
The money you donate would specifically buy a lighting kit (something I had previously borrowed from university, and didn't think that I'd miss so much!) which would make it possible to do the portrait sittings of the members of the WI, Crown Green Bowling club, and the Scrabble club. The light kit is also a fantastic general investment for me, which is why it is a priority. Secondly the money would help towards paying for a high quality printer, which would make it much cheaper and faster for me to produce high quality prints, which is very important! 
The end result will be a local exhibition and an online gallery with prints available. I would like to exhibit further away but that is something that I would have to apply for further in to the project, but I will keep you posted!
Basically at the moment I have somewhere between 5 and 10 % of a project done... Your donation would make it possible for me to complete the project, the rest is legwork!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

So about 4 years ago, I got scuba certified, and took a camera underwater, and I found out that just here in Northern California, the marine life is amazing and beautiful, and also, I was really good at taking underwater photos.

This project is to create a book featuring primarily underwater photography taken in California. The book will contain my best photos taken both above and under the water from various locations in California, descriptions of the photo subjects, how the photos were taken and any important techniques used, and other related information. From what I've seen in the last couple years, there have been very few books published since digital photography has taken off in the underwater scene, and many people are unaware how amazing California is underwater. To do this, I need your help. And if you help me, I'll also helping out a local cause that is incredibly valuable to everyone that scuba divers and others in the Monterey area.  If I receive enough funding.

<p>Photography is often a gateway to learning about the world around you. For as long as I have been a professional photographer, I have made the study and photography of snowflakes my winter passion. The project has taught me more than I could have imagined about physics, light, beauty and how we see the world. This book is the culmination of my snowflake project; I want to share all of my knowledge, images and inspiration with the world in a book that will last forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The book is currently set to the following:</p>
<p>- 300 pages</p>
<p>- Hardcover, case-bound image-wrapped (I'm not a fan of ""dust jackets"")</p>
<p>- 8.5” square</p>
<p>The book will contain all of my snowflake images, and will detail every photographic and editing technique used in their creation – and I encourage you to try it for yourself! The book will also contain all of the science and physics of snowflakes that I can share without personally having a degree in molecular dynamics. I’ll keep the explanations easy to understand and graphic, but the science is fascinating and there are still many unanswered questions. The human mind will also be explored in this book, trying to unravel the mysteries of <em>why­ </em>we find snowflakes so beautiful and captivating.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Snowflakes?</h3>
<p>Snowflakes: These tiny creations of winter have been a curiosity during most childhoods spent in Canada. As I grew up, I became less and less interested in these “trivial” curiosities, and only recently reconnected with them through the lens of my camera. As with most macro subjects, when photographing snowflakes there are many “what the heck is that?” moments as something mysterious is captured, and that childhood curiosity is reborn.</p>
<p>Using a steady hand, an old mitten, and freshly falling snow, you can produce an image worthy of sparking that childhood wonder in even the most jaded onlookers. Some people don’t believe my images are real, and that’s when I know I’ve created something worth talking about. Of course, some people simply think I’m crazy watching me take pictures of an old mitten in a snow storm.</p>
<p>Standing in frigid temperatures a meter away from comfort and warmth can be a daunting task. Using macro equipment that gives you incredibly little focus, it can be hard to even find a snowflake in the viewfinder. Freezing hands and shivering arms can make the situation worse. However, once you’ve got your first snowflake, you’ll smile at every snowfall from then on. But until you succeed, people will think you’re crazy for trying.</p>
<p>(Written as the cover description of Outdoor Photography Canada magazine issue 20, which featured one of my snowflake images.)</p>

<p>Preserved Snowflakes: Using techniques developed in the 1940's by Vincent J. Schaefer, I have been preserving snowflakes with a 1% solution of Formvar.

<p>We are a group of passionate photography students thrilled to be exhibiting our final degree work in London at Freerange 2013. This exhibition gives us a unique opportunity to showcase our work to a large and influential audience from both the fine-art and commercial photography world, and connect directly with important individuals within the industry. With the generous support of Napier University we have secured our place at the exhibition from the 13th to 17th of June. However, in order to get down to London and present our work in the most professional manner we still need to raise some much needed funds.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>With your help this fundraising campaign will cover our work's transportation from Edinburgh to London and back; provide accomodation during the exhibition; allow printing of promotional material so that people from the industry can find out about it and contact us after the exhibition; and finally but most importantly to be able to buy all the neccessary materials needed to fill in the empty space we are exhibiting in (lighting, moving walls, projector and monitors).</p>
<p><br/>Any contributions are really appreciated and you will all get our eternal gratitude for helping with such an important part of our careers. There are also some 'perks' that you can get depending on the contribution you make. This could even include an A2 size print signed by the photographer themselves!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>As London is one of the most important cities in the world for culture, having the opportunity to exhibit there presents an amazing opportunity to all the participants. Napier's photography students have been at Freerange for the past three years and every year the work attracts more and more interest from the industry and the press. It represents not just the work of the individuals and the University, but also Scottish culture and contemporary photographic art in Scotland on the whole.</p>
<p>This year with your support we intend to make Napier's presence at Freerange even more recognizable and successfull by going there even more prepared than previous years.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you think our fundraising cause is something you would like to get involved with you can share this campaign with friends and family or at your personal blogs so that we get as much attention as possible.

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are a group of passionate photography students thrilled to be exhibiting our final degree work in London at Freerange 2013. This exhibition gives us a unique opportunity to showcase our work to a large and influential audience from both the fine-art and commercial photography world, and connect directly with important individuals within the industry. With the generous support of Napier University we have secured our place at the exhibition from the 13th to 17th of June. However, in order to get down to London and present our work in the most professional manner we still need to raise some much needed funds.
 
What We Need & What You Get


With your help this fundraising campaign will cover our work's transportation from Edinburgh to London and back; provide accomodation during the exhibition; allow printing of promotional material so that people from the industry can find out about it and contact us after the exhibition; and finally but most importantly to be able to buy all the neccessary materials needed to fill in the empty space we are exhibiting in (lighting, moving walls, projector and monitors).
Any contributions are really appreciated and you will all get our eternal gratitude for helping with such an important part of our careers. There are also some 'perks' that you can get depending on the contribution you make. This could even include an A2 size print signed by the photographer themselves!!!
 
The Impact


As London is one of the most important cities in the world for culture, having the opportunity to exhibit there presents an amazing opportunity to all the participants. Napier's photography students have been at Freerange for the past three years and every year the work attracts more and more interest from the industry and the press. It represents not just the work of the individuals and the University, but also Scottish culture and contemporary photographic art in Scotland on the whole.
This year with your support we intend to make Napier's presence at Freerange even more recognizable and successfull by going there even more prepared than previous years.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you think our fundraising cause is something you would like to get involved with you can share this campaign with friends and family or at your personal blogs so that we get as much attention as possible. You can also help promote the exhibition itself, and all of our individual work, by talking to any individuals or companies you think could be interested.

<li>Immediate and/or post-edited social media integration! I use Ey-fi wifi and mobile media cards when I shoot and hope to be able to offer my clients at least one instant media image from their shoot -- in a world where almost everyone has some sort of social media presence, who doesn't want to be able to instantaneously share the results of an afternoon or morning spent with a loved one or even alone, celebrating themselves, by sharing a professionally shot image on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or all three? These instant images would be watermarked in a corner with my logo and of phone-quality resolution, a taste of the full shoot that my clients could share while waiting for the final edited product(s).</li>
<li>Pre-shoot questionnaires for my clients that will help me understand how they feel about their own body. I want my portrait and photoshoot work for clients to be something they can celebrate and feel amazing about. I encourage body positivity in every aspect of my own life and interactions with others and I hope to translate that in my work. The questionnaires for clients will be optional but reccomended and include space for the client to list the things they love about their bodies, and things or parts of their body that they do not like focused on. I also have been able to really get a feel for how someone sees themselves in the most positive way by viewing photographs they've taken of themselves, or favorite photographs of themselves taken by others. My pre-shoot approach will be to make sure each client is pleased with, if not delighted by, the way their photographs turn out.</li>
<li>Design integration: photoshoot packages that include media, ie. bragbooks or fully designed photobooks to keep or to give as gifts, save the date cards or flat designs with engagement shoot images, ect.</li>
<li>Unconventional &amp; fun photoshoot offerings: Wreck-the-Dress sessions for brides or entire bridal parties, highly stylized shoots, photoshoots for album art and more.</li>

<h2>Cleaning Out My Closet</h2>
<p>My name is Tony Blake aka Miguel, I've been making photos for over 30 years but I've only shown them in small spurts and less than a handfull at that.  Now, I have hundreds of images that I'd like to share, some old and some new.</p>
<p>They've been in the closet for almost as long as me, and I think it's time we both <a href=""http://livingtheagapesecret.com/images/Balance_1995.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Balance""><br/></a>stepped out and gotta little love.</p>
<p>I feel it's important for others to see the struggle some of us have with turning in our work for fear of rejection; and still get through the struggle with persistence.</p>
<p>Because I love my work so much it's been like a child to me that I've kept locked away, safe from harm and judgement, but now it's time to let my children step out and see the world. They may fall on their face or they may stand tall and thrive on their own, but I'll never know until I try.  This is me trying.</p>
<p>The Rock n' Roll images were created in 1980-81 mostly at the World Famous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starwood_Club"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Starwood"">Starwood</a> 1972-1981.

<h2><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The funds are for printing, framing, and gallery expenses for a one-man show in Los Angeles to start with.  With success, the show will travel. </li>
<li>My intention is to put together a show with the funds raised, so if I raise the full amount it will be the show I would like to put on.  If I fall short, it will be a smaller shjow, with fewer prints.</li>
<li>Either way I will be creating large prints on canvas and showing them to the public!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>I feel these images are a part of history that shouldn't be forgotten and shared with others.  I also need to do this so I can move forward with the rest of my art and have a sense of completion as well.</p>

Cleaning Out My Closet
My name is Tony Blake aka Miguel, I've been making photos for over 30 years but I've only shown them in small spurts and less than a handfull at that.  Now, I have hundreds of images that I'd like to share, some old and some new.
They've been in the closet for almost as long as me, and I think it's time we both stepped out and gotta little love.
I feel it's important for others to see the struggle some of us have with turning in our work for fear of rejection; and still get through the struggle with persistence.
Because I love my work so much it's been like a child to me that I've kept locked away, safe from harm and judgement, but now it's time to let my children step out and see the world. They may fall on their face or they may stand tall and thrive on their own, but I'll never know until I try.  This is me trying.
The Rock n' Roll images were created in 1980-81 mostly at the World Famous Starwood 1972-1981. It was one of Hollywood's most infamous night clubs, owned by Eddie Nash (see Wonderland - Boogie Nights).

My goal is to print and display as many prints from this period as funds will allow, in a One-Man Show somewhere in Los Angeles.
The success of this project will allow me to create a book so these images won't be trapped in my closet forever.

I met Timothy on Santa Monica Blvd. in West Hollywood one day while remodeling a  Sex Shop.  I was in the shop with my back to the door when I ""felt"" Tim walking behind me.  I stopped what I was doing and ran outside and yelled, 150 ft. down the street an older man waited for me as I ran to him.  I introduced myself to him, telling him ""I feel like I know you"" he responded with a ""me too"", I told him I'd love to take his photograph and he invited me to his home.  The results are here in the form of images.

Timothy & Rosemary Leary
Timothy and his ex-wife Rosemary Leary taken at the FilmoreSF, they had just re-united after her years of living underground to avoid being arrested, look at her strength.

Purpose

The funds are for printing, framing, and gallery expenses for a one-man show in Los Angeles to start with.  With success, the show will travel. 
My intention is to put together a show with the funds raised, so if I raise the full amount it will be the show I would like to put on.  If I fall short, it will be a smaller shjow, with fewer prints.
Either way I will be creating large prints on canvas and showing them to the public!

Motivation

I feel these images are a part of history that shouldn't be forgotten and shared with others.  I also need to do this so I can move forward with the rest of my art and have a sense of completion as well.

<p>Hello! My name is Sarah Cantrill. As far back as I can remember, I have been working with glass. My family has owned a glass manufacturing plant in Calgary, Alberta my whole life and over time, my parents grew their business from a small operation inside our basement to a 13,000 sq. ft. shop. But glass is my Dad’s passion - he was a glazing instructor at a post-secondary school for many years and continues to be one of the trade’s experts in the city.</p>
<p>However, my own passion has never really been awakened in this business… until we happened upon our new product… Glass Photographs! I have always had an interest in photography but never really explored it. But now I’m able to combine that interest with my experience in glass!</p>
<p>Already, I have learned so much about an array of topics - photography, editing, online marketing, and the crowdfunding process - all of which I have found myself to be very interested in and excited to work with. Sometimes, my husband has to remind me to take time off but it just doesn’t feel like work to me!<br/></p>

 ImpactWe want to make a difference through our Glass Photographs on both a personal and broader community / societal level.We aspire to uplift and create positive feelings through them. In your home, we want Glass Photographs to make you feel something, to stir something inside you. When your eye meets a Glass Photograph, we want it to remind you of the moment you took the original photograph (the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings). We want Glass Photographs to evoke emotion – even just for a moment – to help you recapture the feeling. Gift cards are also available as a perk.  Great for weddings or new baby arrivals! Risks & Challenges       One of the challenges we face is website development - as a well-designed and easy to use website is crucial to our ability to share Glass Photographs.         Another challenge we face with this project is packaging for shipping. Glass has a tendency to break… and this is a potential problem we have to overcome. We have ideas on how to overcome this through custom packaging. However, this requires tooling fees and significant quantities in order to make it a viable way to ship. But this can be expensive initially!       Through this crowdfunding campaign, we hope to attain both your input and contributions to help create the best site for the easiest user experience! (If you live in the Calgary area and would rather pick up, please contact us at connect@glassphotographs.ca)Background
Hello! My name is Sarah Cantrill. As far back as I can remember, I have been working with glass. My family has owned a glass manufacturing plant in Calgary, Alberta my whole life and over time, my parents grew their business from a small operation inside our basement to a 13,000 sq. ft. shop. But glass is my Dad’s passion - he was a glazing instructor at a post-secondary school for many years and continues to be one of the trade’s experts in the city.
However, my own passion has never really been awakened in this business… until we happened upon our new product… Glass Photographs! I have always had an interest in photography but never really explored it. But now I’m able to combine that interest with my experience in glass!
Already, I have learned so much about an array of topics - photography, editing, online marketing, and the crowdfunding process - all of which I have found myself to be very interested in and excited to work with. Sometimes, my husband has to remind me to take time off but it just doesn’t feel like work to me!


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if Glass Photographs are not your thing, the timing isn’t right or you are not in a position to contribute, there are still many ways you can help us in our project!

THE BACKSTORY
In February of 2011, the massive protests against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker awoke me from my slumber and changed my life completely. I immersed myself within the front lines of the fight for justice and equality, and I haven't looked back even once. Fast forward two years and nine months and I am now living in New York City, traveling all over the US and internationally to stand with others who are striving for a better world. In the process, I have been arrested, pepper sprayed, tear gassed, hit with water cannons, and shot at with plastic bullets. I have slept on planes, trains, and buses, outside in the rain and snow, and on strangers' couches. And, everywhere I go, I have my camera in my hands. It has been an exciting, intense, and unpredictable journey where I am constantly being inspired by the people and movements I capture through the lens of my camera.A photo of me on the streets of Istanbul, Turkey.

If the goal is not reached, then all contributors will receive their money back.RISKS AND CHALLENGESAs with most things in life, unforeseeable obstacles and setbacks may come up. Although I plan to have the book completed by mid-February, since that will be the 3-year anniversary of the Wisconsin Uprising, there is always a chance that it may take longer. I promise to post updates if any issues should arise, and will work my hardest to get the books, prints, and postcards out within a timely manner.PRESSROAR Magazine: http://roarmag.org/2013/11/gezi-park-photography-jenna-pope/Popular Resistance: http://www.popularresistance.org/upcoming-book-an-activist-armed-with-a-camera/RT America:",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>In 2016 I collaborated with the Latvian Probation Service and five of their clients by providing a nine month, weekly photography workshop devised as a social art project.

<p><strong>Project Description</strong></p>
<p>This project had its beginnings in November 2014 with Šķeļot viļņus (Breaking the Waves), a cooperative effort to develop and implement an informal education program for incarcerated young people, as part of the Project Workshop for Communities 2012-2014.

I found it important, after my initial experience, to keep exploring the minds of the condemned youth and their relationships with society.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The work on the project began in February 2016. I intended to serve only as the intermediary, giving the main role to the participants. I designed a program for a photography workshop that would help the participants to come to an awareness of themselves and their environment via photography, as well as acquire new skills and discover new leisure activities (photography, in this case).</p>

<p>The participants of the project The Pleasure of Ignorance – 1 female, 4 male – were clients of the Probation Service. Their task was, for a period of time, to document and reveal their environment as they know it and which otherwise remains hidden to us. The participants were encouraged to express themselves using the visual language, rather uncommon for them. There was no specific target of photography, it could be anything – local architecture, scenery, people or stray cats.</p>

Almost 40 films were filled, some of them exposed to light, some caught in the developing machine, 3 cameras malfunctioned, shifting colors, and most of the initial photos have fingers covering the lens partially or fully.

Project Description
This project had its beginnings in November 2014 with Šķeļot viļņus (Breaking the Waves), a cooperative effort to develop and implement an informal education program for incarcerated young people, as part of the Project Workshop for Communities 2012-2014. I was invited to organize a self-portrait workshop in Daugavgrīva prison Baltais gulbis (The White Swan). I found it important, after my initial experience, to keep exploring the minds of the condemned youth and their relationships with society.
 

 
In the late autumn 2015 I learned of a new Probation Service (Riga, Latvia) program in 2016 for clients conditionally discharged or released pre-term.
 

 
The work on the project began in February 2016. I intended to serve only as the intermediary, giving the main role to the participants. I designed a program for a photography workshop that would help the participants to come to an awareness of themselves and their environment via photography, as well as acquire new skills and discover new leisure activities (photography, in this case).
 

 
The participants of the project The Pleasure of Ignorance – 1 female, 4 male – were clients of the Probation Service. Their task was, for a period of time, to document and reveal their environment as they know it and which otherwise remains hidden to us. The participants were encouraged to express themselves using the visual language, rather uncommon for them. There was no specific target of photography, it could be anything – local architecture, scenery, people or stray cats.
 

 
With recurring meetings, their technique of photography was improved, making them more confident with their decisions and more perceptive. With time, their interest in photography, or the absence thereof, became evident. Their difficult life-styles would prevent their participation at times, just to have most of the participants return to the project after a while. Almost 40 films were filled, some of them exposed to light, some caught in the developing machine, 3 cameras malfunctioned, shifting colors, and most of the initial photos have fingers covering the lens partially or fully.

<p>I'm Nick, 25 years old, during the week I'm a professional aircraft mechanic. When I'm not working on aircraft I'm usually out taking pictures of them, or any other object or landscape that strikes me as beautiful.</p>

<p>I haven't had any formal training in photography, but years of practice and experimentation have led to a unique style and a wide variety of photos. I've found that most of my best photos come from those out of the blue moments where I see a scene and just say ""Wow!"" then break out my camera and capture it.</p>

<p>Much like aviation, photography can turn in to an expensive activity! Buying new lenses, camera bodies, various other pieces of equipment, and traveling to new locations are expenses that hold many amateur photographers back. That's why I'm running ths campaign, so I can continue to expand my creativity and elevate the quality of my photos.</p>

<p>Eventually I'd love to grow my photography hobby into a buisness, while that goal may be far in the future, I see this as the first step in the transition.</p>

<p align=""JUSTIFY""><span>Only in more recent times, the relationship between man and the forest seems to have stopped, or at least have suffered a backlash: the wood can become an economic thing or a place for entertainment, but seems to have lost that aura of magic that had characterized it for millenniums. </span><span>Yet, within each of us, a reflection of that magic remained. </span><span>We realize that when we cross the threshold of a wooded area, the verticality of the trunks (the ""pillars of heaven"" of American Indians), the inability to gaze wander too far, the games of light and shadow, the shapes of the log or the texture of the bark, the cracks of dry leaves underfoot,  the smell of earth and moisture, the shapes and colors of mushrooms, berries, vines, everything seems to contribute to create an habitat able to solicit the imagination and stimulate the senses. </span><span>For this reason the woods -even though sometimes we refuse to admit it- are absolutely essential for us.</span></p>

I loves Nature, and trees are my best photographic passion. So, this is the reason why I made the Lucus project.
My project aims to explore, thanks to photography, forests not only as a natural environment, but also as places where is deposited and secured our imagination, the place of the sublime and the beauty, the perfect harmony between culture, history and nature.
What I want to do are essentially three things: a hard cover, high quality Book with black and white images and texts about the project theme; a DVD with 3D photographs (to watch by cyan-red glasses) and QTVR images to navigate and that gives the impression ""to be in the forest"" and finally an Exhibition made with Cyanoypes prints of the B&W images of the project, and also Anthotypes and Lumenprints to illustrate the ""Herbarium"" section. The basic concept  is that the forest is characterized by two key elements: the light of the sun (which provides the energy) and the time, that allows the trees to grow, become monumental, and to live for thousands of years old. So, this is the reason why I choose this old classic print techniques to print the exhibition.

What I need to realize my project are time (I provide by myself!) and money, for whom I need your help. 9000,00 € (about 10,000 USD) is not a so big amount, but is out of my economical power! 
 
CONSIDERATIONS
The first temple in which men have worshipped their gods, was the forest. These immense cathedrals of nature that covered the planet, evoking the magic and sacredness of the divine, create environments of light and shadow, perfumes and colors, suggestions and emotions. 
Over time, cathedrals became of stone and brick, but the relationship between man and the forest continued: just think of the thousands of legends that have for background or character the forest, or Lucus of the Romans, the sacred groves that could not be violated becouse dedicated to the gods, or think to medieval witches' Sabbath, that took place -according to popular belief- in clearings of the forests.
Only in more recent times, the relationship between man and the forest seems to have stopped, or at least have suffered a backlash: the wood can become an economic thing or a place for entertainment, but seems to have lost that aura of magic that had characterized it for millenniums. Yet, within each of us, a reflection of that magic remained. We realize that when we cross the threshold of a wooded area, the verticality of the trunks (the ""pillars of heaven"" of American Indians), the inability to gaze wander too far, the games of light and shadow, the shapes of the log or the texture of the bark, the cracks of dry leaves underfoot,  the smell of earth and moisture, the shapes and colors of mushrooms, berries, vines, everything seems to contribute to create an habitat able to solicit the imagination and stimulate the senses. For this reason the woods -even though sometimes we refuse to admit it- are absolutely essential for us.
 They are the home of our fantasies and our dreams.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary
</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Cody Langford. I live in Northern rural California. I have just recently became a registered charity known in California as, ""Remember Syria Relief"". I have gathered in the past supplies for Syrian refugee's and have successfully coordinated with other organization with their gratitude on making sure the much needed Relief of supplies arrives in safe hands and to the right hands.</p>
<p>I am the sole owner and board member of Remember Syria Relief. I am currently waiting approval of Tax-Exempt Status from the IRS but do have a EIN number;</p>
<p>My cousin Cedric Mcbane has done photography for some time now, but with his amazing work he would like to donate half of each $15 dollar donation to the refugee's of Syria. With donating $15 dollars, Cedric will then send you a 8x10 Scenic Print he himself took. Half of the dollars of the $15 will be turned back to Syrian refugee's.</p>
<p>We are going to just start by trying 10 prints at this time. If this picks up we will consider on doing more! Thank you for your most valuable help.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>A $15 dollar donation and you will receive a 8x10 Scenic Print to add to your household.</p>
<p>The split half that is donated to Remember Syria Relief will be used to purchase sleeping bags, socks, and other winter items to prepare refugee's for 2015 upcoming winter. I will then use these donations to purchase the items, deliver them to a registered partner non-profit and with their gracious help move the aid overseas. The container ship usually takes 4-6 weeks to arrive from leaving the Oakland Bay Port in California. A NGO that is partnered with the charity will then deliver them in besieged areas among Syria. Also to refugee's that are currently displaced, and non-internally displaced.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It will bring hundreds of smiles to most needed people in the worse conditions no human could bear. I myself went to the Turkish/Syrian border and aided children in a makeshift village. Their smiles of joy brought tears to my eyes. It will make a huge impact, even the smallest deed's.</p>
<p>I have also in the past successfully sent aid to Syria within being in California. You can find more at Remember Syria's website; <a href=""http://www.RememberSyria.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.RememberSyria.com</a> . Or search Facebook; Remember Syria.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Once these sleeping bags and winter items arrive in ports such as Jordan, Turkey, or Lebanon; NGO's then find the proper, and most efficent way to get the supplies to the most needed families in and bordering Syria.</p>

The project explores the socio-economic causes of crime and delinquency, encouraging visitors to consider the human dimension of doing time while growing old in prison; the objective being to open the eyes of a younger public, to play a role in stimulating social and institutional change by addressing these issues of social justice and human dignity through images and interviews.</span></h4><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/720307/files/20140715190544-poa_platinum_wide.jpg?1405476344"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;""><br/></span></span></h4><h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">More than two million North Americans are now behind bars, an estimated 35 percent of them edging far past middle age. <i>""Prisoners of Age"" </i>offers a microcosmic glimpse of what lies ahead in this new millennium. </span><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">Existing prison space is in serious decline, bunk space and medical costs are soaring.

I want to talk to you about
a project I’ve been working on for over 18 years, called Prisoners of Age. It
started out as the first privately mounted, large scale photo exhibition at
Alcatraz, the world’s most infamous prison. The exhibit featured portraits I had
taken of geriatric convicts - prisoners of their advanced age, as much as they
were prisoners of the penitentiaries that kept them locked up.Since then, the exhibit has been held in other cities and
prison museums in North America, Europe and Australia. I was originally
motivated to take these photos as a study of some of the most marginalized
people in our world. But an interesting phenomenon has occurred over the years.
The reaction to these photos has evolved from questioning the compassion of our
society to building a safer one.The portraits have consistently resonated with young people, particularly among at-risk youth, in a way that wasn’t expected [see 'I Can See What I Can Be' clip in the Gallery Images] I have been told by educators, social workers, police and young people themselves that the stories and portraits of these convicts in their advanced age have had a genuine effect on kids. Seeing the consequences of a mistake or crime that often resulted in a lifetime behind bars is making troubled kids think about their own actions. Sharing these photos as an educational tool with
as large an audience as possible has become a real passion for me, and I hope
you will want to support it. We have the opportunity to present a new exhibit at Alcatraz, where it would be seen by over a million visitors from July to
December, 2015 . However, mounting a new series of twelve-foot tall, larger than life
photos is a very costly challenge. Although Alcatraz is prepared to welcome
“Prisoners of Age” back, there is no funding available for the project.If you are interested in supporting the Prisoners of Age
project, you can help by making a financial contribution. This will help us
print up new images for the exhibition, build the lighting needed for the exhibition and take care of shipping the exhibit to and from The Rock.There are many levels of sponsorship available, so take the
time to read through this site and help us to share these images and
life-lessons with a new generation.A huge Thank You to all of you!About ""Prisoners of Age"":THE PROJECT
""Prisoners of Age"" is a series of photographs and interviews with elderly inmates and corrections personnel conducted in prisons both in the United States and Canada since 1996.The exhibition and 208-page companion book serve to capture the complexity of a subject that is seldom contemplated – aging offenders in the correctional system. The project explores the socio-economic causes of crime and delinquency, encouraging visitors to consider the human dimension of doing time while growing old in prison; the objective being to open the eyes of a younger public, to play a role in stimulating social and institutional change by addressing these issues of social justice and human dignity through images and interviews.More than two million North Americans are now behind bars, an estimated 35 percent of them edging far past middle age. ""Prisoners of Age"" offers a microcosmic glimpse of what lies ahead in this new millennium. Existing prison space is in serious decline, bunk space and medical costs are soaring. Geriatric inmates comprise the fastest growing age group in the United States. The average expense of medical care and maintenance for inmates over 55 is $79,000 per year --  about four times the norm- sometimes as high as $150, 000. Meanwhile, the people who manage North America's prison system are worrying more and more about how to handle the imminent explosion in the geriatric population.
THE EXHIBITION
The portraits in the ""Prisoners of Age"" exhibition are immense [8‘x12’ for the upcoming exhibit], graphic and command the viewer’s attention. The full exhibition comprises 60-70 prints, vertically supended from the museum ceilings. All prints include text from interviews with inmates and corrections personnel. It’s hard to imagine these old men and women as criminals running from the law.  Many of their stories are about fits of anger, rage, foolish steps they took in their youth that have brought them to where they are now. Others are remorseless. ""Prisoners of Age"" seeks a balance of the two dispositions, through images and text, lending insight into the lawbreaker's proclivity to commit crime.It is our ambition that we can persuade a younger audience to avoid making the same mistakes that doomed so many of these inmates.The project has been exhibited at: Alcatraz Penitentiary [2000-2001], The National Archives of Canada, Ottawa, [2002] Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, [2002], the Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin, Ireland [2004], Cirque du Soleil Headquarters, Montreal [2006], Fremantle Prison & Museum, Fremantle, West Australia [2010], Powerhouse Gallery, Brisbane, Australia [2011]. The exhibit returns to Alcatraz in July 2015 for 6 months where more than one million people will see it. THE DOCUMENTARYThe television documentary explores, illuminates and extends photographer Ron Levine’s groundbreaking project with geriatric prisoners.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Hello everyone! I am Nydia Williams, a senior at Ithaca College studying Still Photography and African Diaspora Studies. This semester I am enrolled in Photo Workshop- my last photography course before I graduate in December 2011. The goal of this course is create a body of work that is continuously revisited and built upon throughout the semester. The product will be a cohesive set of photographs that are presentation ready.My entire class will have a group exhibition and display our work in downtown Ithaca for the community to enjoy in the first week of May, 2011. </span></h3>
<div>My project is an exploration of identity using a large format camera. This means that I am shooting film (the negatives are 4 inches by 5 inches), envision one of those cameras where people put the black cloth over their head and that's me!<br/>
</div>
<div>In order to complete my project, I need help. While there are many reasons that I need financial assistance to fund this project, I ask for your help on the basis of the work. I have put a lot of thought, time, tears, and joy into this work. I believe in it, and I think you will too. It is important because it reflects the artistic work of my major, as well as the academic work of my minor. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>As I am sitting here looking at all the photographs I have made thus far, I see a body of work that evokes pain, confusion, wonder, and frustration. These are emotions we each experience as we each try to figure out who we truly are. For me, it has always been about the journey and finding beauty within the struggle of coming to a personal understanding of who you are. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><u>Artist Statement </u>(work in progress)</b></div>
<div>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I have always considered photography to be a selfish act; a negotiation
between what is real or tangible in the world, how I make sense of it, and my
place within. I am interested in how my work functions as a replacement for the
words I have trouble finding. My photographs work as momentary output,
reflections of my current condition. They are often an amalgam of memory and
fantasy, because at times I am unable to distinguish between the two. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With this series of photographs I am exploring the concept
of identity and the ways in which it is formed, fostered, and functions. Coming
to an understanding about oneself is an intimate experience, but also very much
about the world and society at large. We are constantly receiving messages
about who we are (and should be) based upon inherent traits such as race,
gender, and sexuality. Historically these constructs offer certain people privileges,
while they leave others oppressed with limited access to resources. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My subjects enter a space of contemplation, which is tainted
by my personal journey of self-awareness but also reflective of their
individuality. As people of African descent stereotypes have been created and
perpetuated about them in American. <span style="""">Often, these myths were used as justification for
mistreatment and to deny Black people equal status, rights, and opportunities. It
is within this environment where they are forced to see themselves through the
eyes of others, which they must come to understand themselves.</span> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">How do Black people cultivate and nourish a positive self-image? How

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>Because I have applied for two grants this semester, I have a very detailed budget...but that's kind of boring. In it's entirety my project will cost about $1,400, but here are the most important things you need to know, to understand where the money will go. I have already produced the bulk of the work, most of the images are made, developed, and now in digital form. Now, I have to get them ready for presentation which means they need to be mounted or framed- in addition I am making a photo book. <br/>
</div><div>
<p>I plan on making 24X30 prints that will be Sintra mounted, which means they will be mounted to plastic and laminated. I want to have 10 prints total, that cost approximately $100 each. I believe that 10 prints are needed in order for the viewer to gain a complete understanding of my exploration. </p>
<p>For those of you that enjoy the work I make, this is an opportunity for you to be a part of my work. I always say that- I could never produce work if it were not for the help of my family,friends, and community. So many people have been my models, assistants, location lenders, prop securers and support in general. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can come to the exhibition! Some how, some way, I will have work to exhibit and you should come see it. I will post the details on my Facebook page when the time comes. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Chris Pahls.  I am a first year art teacher at USD 299 Sylvan-Lucas Unified High School in Sylvan Grove Ks (USD299.org).  We are a small rural school in the middle of the beautiful Great Plains.  Putting technology into the hands of our students is something we strive for.  While many schools are cutting art programs, USD 299 sees the importance of education in the arts and takes steps to preserve it.  We are offering our art students a new class this year:  Graphic Design and Digital Photography.  After unifying with another district last year, the school's camera collection grew from two to four Canon Rebel XT's.  With last years expected enrollment of 6 to 7 students, four cameras would be plenty for teaching and shooting digital photographs on a daily basis.  However, much to my amazement and joy, my numbers are much higher.  We have 15 students enrolled!  While we are thrilled to have the equipment that we do, it is simply not enough to teach 15 eager photographers and share with our Desktop Publishing class.  You now have the opportunity to help us fund this awesome learning experience.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here is what your contribution can do.  By helping to fund our campaign you can put the power of creativity, imagination, documentation, and digital technology into the hands of some really great kids who deserve it.  Our photography staff will take pictures for our yearbook, art shows, their personal portfolios, various community events, and the first school news paper we've had in a long time.  These students will be able to showcase all of the great things that go on in this school to their communities.  You can give our students the ability to learn a medium that they can love for the rest of their lives.  Some of them might even go on to make a little money at it.  You will be providing the foundation for numerous art and journalism scholarships.  Art education helps students academically, socially, and prepares them to be well rounded individuals who become productive adults capable of changing the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for funding for 5 more classroom cameras and 1 instructor camera.  We will be buying from B and H (bhphotovideo.com).  They offer great equipment at a great price.  We are looking to purchase 5 Sony Alpha A390's or 5 Canon Rebel XS's and one Pentax K-R for instructor use.  Any funding left after purchasing cameras will go to protective equipment, bags, lenses, and memory cards.</p>

The planes remain abandoned in nowhere since 10-70 years. It's part of my long term project 'restwert' (german for residual value) to document abandoned objects with fascinating backgrounds like cold war relicts, olympic sites, flooded churches, railroad tracks, never finished nuclear reactors, overgrown adventure parks etc. -> www.dietmareckell.comThis series is for me more than wrecks not worth to recover: it's surreal - beautiful airplanes in vast landscapes with wonderful stories. 'happy end' is about
heroes - the pilots who turned desasters into miracles,
destiny - to survive a crash landing and get found in nowhere,
time - crashed in seconds and then untouched for decades,
space - even majestic airplanes can look lost in vast nature,
'the end' - while most get scrapped in junk yards - these found a place to 'rest in peace'.
It started with my interest in the visual disruption of nostalgic technology in endless landscapes - but soon i got hooked to these planes/stories and spent over two years researching and documenting them. Aviation miracles are rare and the planes remaining out there are very remote - but the challenge was motivation and it was like a pilgrimage to get to these 'wonders' on 4 continents from Papua New Guinea to the Arctic Circle. My photography is not about documenting the planes condition & details but how they are embedded in grand nature after so many years. I try to capture the surreal beauty of these settings using high viewpoints or shooting through layers.

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm so glad to have you here, my name is Devan Squires. Thank you for your interest in this project!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book: The Gardens at Temple Square</h3>
<p>From 2016 to 2020 I lived, worked, and worshiped within a half-mile area, allowing me to walk through Temple Square almost every day. The spring flowers so full of life, color, and joy inspired me to start photographing the gardens. Once I started photographing, I realized that I wanted to capture the beauty of every season over multiple years. This project became even more important to me after the announcement of Temple Square’s closing for several years for renovations. </p>
<p>The Gardens at Temple Square is a 9 inch by 12 inch, 168 page book that immerses you in the lush gardens on Temple Square. The book documents the gardens throughout the seasons with photographs and poetry. Ruth Stoneman wrote and curated the wonderful selection of poetry in this book. The poems are uplifting and joyful, reflecting the beauty of the gardens.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I'm a CPA, yup, an accountant trying to self-publish a photography/poetry book! Eleven years ago I started college as a photography student at BYU. After a couple years I was accepted into the Bachelors of Fine Arts - Photography program but instead of pursuing that degree, I decided to switch to accounting.</p>
<p>I have continued to do photography as a hobby, but since the day I decided to discontinue pursuing a photography degree I have had two photography-related goals.</p>
<ol>
<li>Show my photos in a gallery</li>
<li>Publish a book of my photos</li>
</ol>
<p>Nine years later, this book is letting me finally accomplish one of those goals and I am asking you to help me on this journey!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Below is a breakdown of why I am asking for this amount, and what you get in return when you contribute.</p>
<p>Because of the cost efficiency of printing more copies, I am hoping that lots of people will be interested in the book! The $7,600 in funding would go toward printing 100 books, this is an opportunity for you to purchase prints from the book and the book itself since I do not anticipate it being sold in stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>I need $7,600 of funding to cover the cost of printing 100 books. </li>
<li>I am printing through a high quality, small batch publisher called Edition One. Printing 100 books comes out to approximately $76/book.<ul>
<li>base cost of $46/book</li>
<li>+ fees $200</li>
<li>+ shipping from the printer $500</li>
<li>+ taxes $350</li>
<li>+ shipping to you $15/book</li>
<li>+ Indigogo fees 9%</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Even if you can't, or don't want to purchase a book, there are great perks for any amount, even $5. I even have some great bonus perks I'm throwing in when you purchase a book!<ul>
<li>$5 - Phone wallpaper emailed to you</li>
<li>$10 - Personalized thank you postcard with a photo from the book</li>
<li>$25 - 8x10 print</li>
<li>$50 - 11x14 print</li>
<li>$75 - 16x20 print</li>
<li><strong>$100 - 1 copy of the book</strong></li>
<li>$200 - 1 copy of the book, plus a 20x30 print</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><i>To select a photo, visit this URL to view the options</i></li>
<li><i><a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z0hPUbwawdj-lfk42p6Hu44WdeBOj9n2?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z0hPUbwawdj-lfk42p6Hu44WdeBOj9n2?usp=sharing</a></i></li>
<li><i>Note the number and letter on the photo and select those options when you choose your perk</i></li>
</ul>
<i>Note, all prints are your choice from a selection of photos included in the book</i>
</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>On some platforms if the goal isn't reached then no money is contributed, that is not the case with Indiegogo, your contribution will still go toward funding the project. If I don't reach the overall goal I will send you the perk you have purchased. </p>
<p>The book is ready to go to the printer, and I would love to share it with as many people as I possibly can; it has been a labor of love for almost five years!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that this is a difficult time, if you would still like to support me but are unable to make a monetary donation at this time, here are other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with your friends and family</li>
<li>Share on social media using the Indiegogo share tools, or you can share the posts I've created on Facebook and Instagram (@DevanSquires)</li>
</ul>

Nine years later, this book is letting me finally accomplish one of those goals and I am asking you to help me on this journey!
 

What We Need & What You Get
Below is a breakdown of why I am asking for this amount, and what you get in return when you contribute.
Because of the cost efficiency of printing more copies, I am hoping that lots of people will be interested in the book! The $7,600 in funding would go toward printing 100 books, this is an opportunity for you to purchase prints from the book and the book itself since I do not anticipate it being sold in stores.

I need $7,600 of funding to cover the cost of printing 100 books. 
I am printing through a high quality, small batch publisher called Edition One. Printing 100 books comes out to approximately $76/book.
base cost of $46/book
+ fees $200
+ shipping from the printer $500
+ taxes $350
+ shipping to you $15/book
+ Indigogo fees 9%



 
Even if you can't, or don't want to purchase a book, there are great perks for any amount, even $5. I even have some great bonus perks I'm throwing in when you purchase a book!
$5 - Phone wallpaper emailed to you
$10 - Personalized thank you postcard with a photo from the book
$25 - 8x10 print
$50 - 11x14 print
$75 - 16x20 print
$100 - 1 copy of the book
$200 - 1 copy of the book, plus a 20x30 print

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z0hPUbwawdj-lfk42p6Hu44WdeBOj9n2?usp=sharing
Note the number and letter on the photo and select those options when you choose your perk

Note, all prints are your choice from a selection of photos included in the book



 
On some platforms if the goal isn't reached then no money is contributed, that is not the case with Indiegogo, your contribution will still go toward funding the project. If I don't reach the overall goal I will send you the perk you have purchased. 
The book is ready to go to the printer, and I would love to share it with as many people as I possibly can; it has been a labor of love for almost five years!

<p>Our project looks in to the digression of buildings which have become forgotten in time. We photograph derelict buildings and try to show their beauty and architecture in a positive light, many buildings we photograph will soon be knocked down or deteriorate past repair, so we try to record their presence before this time comes so they can be remembered and seen by those who may otherwise not have the opportunity to witness such grandeur.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Why we need funding</strong><br/>In December 2010 we visited Europe (along with many other locations around the UK at other times) for a month. We explored Germany, Brugge, Belgium, France and Switzerland. Now, we want to do it again- on an even more epic scale! We need to raise money to make this happen, last winter it cost us around £3000, for ferries, hostels, supplies, safety equipment and petrol. Your funding will help to kick start the process of this again so we can produce more stunning imagery of buildings we know only have months left of existence. By donating we hope to be able to show off these buildings to everyone, especially those who have donated to the cause, to show the world these beautiful locations, which many do not even know exist. Your funding will help pay for campsites, ferries petrol as well as supporting us for our location hunting, editing time, creation time, and the compilation of the book.<br/><br/>The book we want to make should be around 25cmx 25cm with a strong solid exterior. About 30% of this book is already photographed and ready for production. We are aiming for a paperweight of 200 GSM and between 50 and 70 pages. These details can be finalised when we have all of the images and order quantities. The more books we sell, the more money we can put in to making the book even better; thicker bigger, stronger!  </p>
<p>Our book will be filled with full-page colour photographs, it will also express our thoughts, feelings and knowledge of the history of each individual structure pictured. We will explain the smells, the atmosphere, the light, everything we can think of about our experience. This is going to be very special to us as it will be our first book we have marketed to an audience. It will have a hard exterior and be an item to keep and treasure, a solid relic to the buildings it contains which may no longer stand. The book will ignite your senses, fill you with awe, and flood you with feelings. The aim of our book is to celebrate architecture and grandeur of decay. The book will demonstrate an understanding of key safety precautions which is not normally expressed in these types of books.

<h2><strong>        THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OUR PROJECT!</strong></h2>
<p> </p></div>","Summary of our project
Our project looks in to the digression of buildings which have become forgotten in time. We photograph derelict buildings and try to show their beauty and architecture in a positive light, many buildings we photograph will soon be knocked down or deteriorate past repair, so we try to record their presence before this time comes so they can be remembered and seen by those who may otherwise not have the opportunity to witness such grandeur.Why we need fundingIn December 2010 we visited Europe (along with many other locations around the UK at other times) for a month. We explored Germany, Brugge, Belgium, France and Switzerland. Now, we want to do it again- on an even more epic scale! We need to raise money to make this happen, last winter it cost us around £3000, for ferries, hostels, supplies, safety equipment and petrol. Your funding will help to kick start the process of this again so we can produce more stunning imagery of buildings we know only have months left of existence. By donating we hope to be able to show off these buildings to everyone, especially those who have donated to the cause, to show the world these beautiful locations, which many do not even know exist. Your funding will help pay for campsites, ferries petrol as well as supporting us for our location hunting, editing time, creation time, and the compilation of the book.The book we want to make should be around 25cmx 25cm with a strong solid exterior. About 30% of this book is already photographed and ready for production. We are aiming for a paperweight of 200 GSM and between 50 and 70 pages. These details can be finalised when we have all of the images and order quantities. The more books we sell, the more money we can put in to making the book even better; thicker bigger, stronger!  
Our book will be filled with full-page colour photographs, it will also express our thoughts, feelings and knowledge of the history of each individual structure pictured. We will explain the smells, the atmosphere, the light, everything we can think of about our experience. This is going to be very special to us as it will be our first book we have marketed to an audience. It will have a hard exterior and be an item to keep and treasure, a solid relic to the buildings it contains which may no longer stand. The book will ignite your senses, fill you with awe, and flood you with feelings. The aim of our book is to celebrate architecture and grandeur of decay. The book will demonstrate an understanding of key safety precautions which is not normally expressed in these types of books. We do not want to influence people to enter derelict structures not knowing what they are getting themselves in to. We will dedicate a page talking about our photographic kit and our safety kit such as correct masks overalls and footwear, even down to the powerful torches we use to keep safe.What we can offer youAs well as our eternal thanks for all of your support and interest in our project there are some things we can offer to you in return for all of your help. For any donation you make, you will be given access to exclusive video footage of our journey, we will share those little things that make what we do special!  As we are still working on a relatively small scale publishing wise, creating products can be expensive, especially making professional books (not those terrible vista print, bonus print etc etc. ones!)

<p>Decora style is one of the symbols of Harajuku fashion.</p>
<p>Many people in Japan recent years are not aware of this culture, however, it is still widely attracted many foreigners because of its original and uniqueness that you’ve never seen outside of Japan.</p>
<p>To me the originality is the primary importance. We can’t find too many examples of one-of-a-kind fashion cultures in the world other than traditional costumes.

<p>Before the memories fade, I have a thought that my duty is to preserve them as a record.</p>
<p>I have a image in my mind the book speaks about mainly Decora and diverse Harajuku styles of the same period, to reinterpret the history of Decora, using about 500 of images with explanatory notes along time series.</p>

</h3><p><i>Spark540°</i> is a group of young leaders who have come together to use the collective power of their youth to make change. Spark's goals are to foster:</p><p><b>1)</b> <b>personal growth</b> - understanding one's strengths and weaknesses so that each individual can develop their talents, and become more compassionate, loving, and effective people</p><p><b>2)</b> <b>communal knowledge</b> - learning about the population and issues that one's community (school, neighborhood, city/town) faces and giving their time and resources to work towards local solutions</p><p><b>3)</b> <b>global awareness</b> - developing the ability to relate local problems to international ones, empathizing with global despair, poverty, violence and injustice, and building upon critical thinking skills. </p><p><b>4)</b> <b>action</b> - empowering others by spreading one's wealth; we believe that poverty has nothing to do with material objects or money, but rather that happiness, love, balance, and compassion for others are what make you rich or poor. Cash and ""things"" can always be replaced, attained or given away. However the ability to self actualize, dream, achieve and build sustaining relationships is to us, the most valuable currency.

<p>Hello! Lumelang! Moi! My name is Meri Hyöky. I am a professional photographer and web designer. I am originally from Finland, but I have lived in the US for much of my life. In 2011, I travelled to Lesotho in Southern Africa as part of the crew of the film <em>The Forgotten Kingdom.</em> Very quickly, I fell in love with the breathtaking scenery, incredible people and rich culture of this tiny mountain kingdom. Only a month after the completion of filming, I found that I had left behind my life in North Carolina, and had returned to Lesotho.</p>
<p>I have spent the majority of the past two years living in Morija, a small town in Lesotho. Despite its natural beauty and the warmth of its people, Lesotho is a country with many sobering realities: it has the third highest HIV prevalence rate in the world, much of the population lives in poverty, and for many people every day is a struggle to make ends meet.</p>
<p>During my time in Lesotho, I have used my skills to help many organisations and movements that are working to effect positive change in the country. These include Morija Museum &amp; Archives and the Morija Arts &amp; Cultural Festival (<a href=""http://www.morija.co.ls/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.morija.co.ls</a>), Flava of Africa (<a href=""http://www.flavaofafrica.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.flavaofafrica.wordpress.com</a>) and Africa’s Green Generation (<a href=""http://africasgreengeneration.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://africasgreengeneration.wordpress.com/</a>).</p>
<p>Together with my friend and colleague Sejake Mats'ela, I have also founded Uprise Media Centre (<a href=""http://www.uprisemediacentre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.uprisemediacentre.com</a>) - a new initiative in Morija which will provide the local community with affordable internet access, media training and opportunities for the production of visual art.</p>

</li>
</ul><p>In Lesotho and the US, I also use my skills whenever I can to support up-and-coming as well as established artists and musicians.</p>
<p>To me, photography is a tool that allows me to meaningfully and creatively support movements and organisations such as these. Devoting my time and skills to movements and causes that I care about allows me to portray their needs, their work and their successes to a wide audience, helping them to get more exposure, which can lead to funding, support and solidarity from people around the world.</p>
<p>The condition of my camera equipment, however, has severely deteriorated over the years. My Nikon D200, which I have worked with for five years, is falling to pieces. The padding on the outside of the camera has fallen off, I am currently holding my battery in place with a piece of cardboard, and on a technical level there are various functions of the camera which often temperamentally decide to not work. I am increasingly panicked by the number of times it has flashed all manner of error! messages at me in the middle of a photo shoot.</p>
<p>The large majority of the work I do for non-profit organisations is voluntary, and I currently do not have the money to buy new camera equipment.</p>
<p>I am raising funds toward a Nikon D800 camera and a Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens. The Nikon D800, with 36.3 megapixels, is able to capture incredible textures, nuances and details. The Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED lens is a versatile lens which can capture wide-angle landscapes and panoramas, portraits and events in a variety of lighting and weather conditions.</p>
<p>My old Nikon D200 has another great disadvantage: it is unable to capture video. One of the most exciting features of the Nikon D800 is that it is able to shoot HD movies. In a recent survey of non-profit organisations, 80% of respondents said that video is important to their organisation (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/qgjpdfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://tinyurl.com/qgjpdfm</a>). A good quality video is an incredibly powerful medium which non-profit organisations can use to tell real life stories, to give a human face to broad social issues, and to <em>show</em> donors and supporters how their money is being used. This would be a major addition to what I can offer in the work that I do for Uprise and other organisations.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need and What You Get</strong></p>
<p>My fundraising goal is $ 5000. With this money, I will purchase the Nikon D800 camera body (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/lhuk3ve"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/lhuk3ve</a>) and the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED lens (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/ovwlnjz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/ovwlnjz</a>) (<span>The additional money will be used to the pay the fees charged by indiegogo.com).</span></p>
<p>If the entire amount is not raised by this campaign, I hope to at least acquire the camera body, and improve lenses at a later time.</p>
<p>By making a donation to help me purchase this much-needed upgrade in my camera equipment, you will be making a direct contribution to the work that I do for a wide range of worthwhile causes in Lesotho and the US. <span>In return of your support, <span>I am offering all donors</span></span> digital copies of photos of their choosing from my collections over the years.

Hello! Lumelang! Moi! My name is Meri Hyöky. I am a professional photographer and web designer. I am originally from Finland, but I have lived in the US for much of my life. In 2011, I travelled to Lesotho in Southern Africa as part of the crew of the film The Forgotten Kingdom. Very quickly, I fell in love with the breathtaking scenery, incredible people and rich culture of this tiny mountain kingdom. Only a month after the completion of filming, I found that I had left behind my life in North Carolina, and had returned to Lesotho.
I have spent the majority of the past two years living in Morija, a small town in Lesotho. Despite its natural beauty and the warmth of its people, Lesotho is a country with many sobering realities: it has the third highest HIV prevalence rate in the world, much of the population lives in poverty, and for many people every day is a struggle to make ends meet.
During my time in Lesotho, I have used my skills to help many organisations and movements that are working to effect positive change in the country. These include Morija Museum & Archives and the Morija Arts & Cultural Festival (www.morija.co.ls), Flava of Africa (www.flavaofafrica.wordpress.com) and Africa’s Green Generation (http://africasgreengeneration.wordpress.com/).
Together with my friend and colleague Sejake Mats'ela, I have also founded Uprise Media Centre (www.uprisemediacentre.com) - a new initiative in Morija which will provide the local community with affordable internet access, media training and opportunities for the production of visual art.
Causes in the US that I have worked with in the past few years include:

Moore Labs Rescue (Apex, North Carolina) - http://moore-labs.com/

Organics & Sounds (Durham, North Carolina) - http://organicsandsound.com/

Pickards Mountain Eco-Institute (Chapel Hill, North Carolina) - http://pickardsmountain.org/

West Southern Pines Young Leadership Program (Southern Pines, North Carolina)
Boys & Girls Clubs of the Sandhills (Southern Pines, North Carolina) -http://sandhillsbgc.org/

<p>  We are traveling across the United States visiting some of America's most famous zoos by one of our country's oldest forms of transportation, the train.

Now that he has graduated, we are going to see what the rest of the country has to offer as we train through 17 states.The USA Rail Pass is the cheapest way that will allow us to travel the entire country, visiting many cities on a small budget. </p>

<div>
<p>  After doing a little research, we found that most zoos are non-profit and can't just let every photographer/writer duo in for free. Thus we are fundraising to help with admission, travel expenses, and publication of the book. </p>
  If you can't donate maybe there are other ways you can help. We are traveling through Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, Maryland, DC, Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts(pending). If you know anybody in these states with ties to wild life, reserves zoos, or amusement parks and could get us in touch with them it would be a great deal of help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kristel Durand, I have been a professional photographer for over 10 years. I have recently recieved my Masters degree in Photography. Between my professional and educational experience I am ready to transition my photographic work and vision from the private sector to the non-profit sector, specifically with foster children. I am asking for help through crowd funding to get the organization up and running.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $1000.00 dollars to cover all of the start up costs, primarily the filing fees and legal fees to obtain 501c(3) status.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Katchlight will make a huge impact on the lives of foster kids celebrating milestones such as graduating from high school. Many foster children never have the opportunity to have school portraits or professional portraits taken. Katchlight will offer a high quality, complete portrait package to foster kids in the school system.  The portraits will celebrate their achievements, commemorate all of their hard work as well as  give them an oppotunity to participate in a long traditional right of passage that is an american tradition, the senior portrait.</p>

<h3>Ashleigh Lives for analog</h3>
<p>Ever since she got her hands on a Twin Lens Reflex, she has been in love with the rendering, grain, colors, workflow and archival qualities medium format film has to offer. Her biggest fear is that digital photographs can be easily lost as it transfers from hard drive to hard drive. There is no better contender for photo documentation and archiving than the sleek build of a Hasselblad. Having the Hasselblad is important to me because unlike the limitations of my twin lens:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>I can shoot different formats (6x6 and 6x7)<br/>

<li>I can switch out lenses with ease<br/>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>My beautiful Twin Lens Reflex is broken and it requires I send it to Portland to get fixed. But because of the cost of doing this, I think it is a better idea to get a professional grade medium format camera so I can send out my TLR and keep it shooting without DEPENDING on it. I always need photographic equipment. Having medium format back in my life will relieve me of the enormous financial impact purchasing the camera would have on me.
