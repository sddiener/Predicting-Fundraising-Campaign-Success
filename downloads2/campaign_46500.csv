<p>the Swiss Handmade Shoe </p>
<p>Hi! My name's Yves, and I'm a certified Swiss shoemaker. My greatest passion is handmade shoes and their production. I'm owner of the Fusswerk Manufactory, and at the time, I'm mostly making custom-tailored shoes.<br/><br/> My goal is to make handmade, Swiss quality shoes, at a fair price. But for that, I'll need your support!</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Why buy swiss shoes?</em></strong></p>
<p> Switzerland isn't only known for great watches and good chocolate. Swiss artisanry is highly appreciated for it's high quality and precision. The same goes for Swiss Shoemaking.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned in the video, I want to stay true to the tradition of making your shoes by hand. The shoe's original design stems from the early 20th century. I brought that design up to date, and this is the result. You get to choose between a low or high cut shoe.</p>
<p><br/><strong><em>The Basilea</em></strong></p>
<p>The shoe is composed of 100% leather, including the sole. Even the heel consists of the best, massive, layered leather.</p>
<p><br/> As you can see, I've built in something extra. To make sure your new shoes are as lucky as can be, I work two swiss pennies into the heels. Also, the right shoe will receive a decent branding on its inner side. </p>
<p>You'll get to pick from six different colours. Below, you'll see some leather samples. One half was treated with an antique finish, to give you an idea what your shoe will look like in the end. The hand applied finish turns out different every single time applied, so your shoes will be absolutely unique. <br/><br/> Keep in mind that the leather I use for these shoes has only received the absolute minimum in treatment, leaving it as pure as possible. Every hide used, tells the story of an animal. Even with the antique finish, the leather will change with wear. The use will brighten the leather, giving the shoes a distinct look that reflects your history with them. Don't want that? You'll find shoe polish in my E-shop (swiss made, of course) to nurture the leather and darken it again.<br/><br/> Please keep in mind that leather is a natural, and therefore sensitive material. The leather is NOT waterproof and should be treated accordingly. Each skin looks different. Scars in the leather, as well as different color tones, are possible and natural.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How will you get your shoes?</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The official homepage and e-shop will go up, two months after the project's start. There, the low shoe will be available at 870$, and the high cut at 960$, both including shipping and the leathersole. The shop will also feature options for color and customization. Shoes will be available at industry standard sizes, going from US 8½ (EU 39) to 13½ (EU 46).<br/> But to make sure your shoes really fit, you'll be able to print out a form and trace your foot measurements onto it. There will be a video guide to explain the process in detail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first shoes will presumably be shipped March 2013.</p>
<p>To keep up with this schedule, I depend on your funding. With your support, I'll be getting a grinder, a sole sewing machine, a branding iron, boxing and the required stock of fine leather.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to making your shoes!<br/><br/> Cheers,<br/> Yves<br/><br/> Cordial thanks to<br/> Dana, my wife, for her great patience!</p>

Hi! My name's Yves, and I'm a certified Swiss shoemaker. My greatest passion is handmade shoes and their production.

Why buy swiss shoes?
 Switzerland isn't only known for great watches and good chocolate. Swiss artisanry is highly appreciated for it's high quality and precision. The same goes for Swiss Shoemaking.
As I've mentioned in the video, I want to stay true to the tradition of making your shoes by hand. The shoe's original design stems from the early 20th century. I brought that design up to date, and this is the result. You get to choose between a low or high cut shoe.
The Basilea
The shoe is composed of 100% leather, including the sole. Even the heel consists of the best, massive, layered leather.
 As you can see, I've built in something extra. To make sure your new shoes are as lucky as can be, I work two swiss pennies into the heels. Also, the right shoe will receive a decent branding on its inner side. 
You'll get to pick from six different colours. Below, you'll see some leather samples. One half was treated with an antique finish, to give you an idea what your shoe will look like in the end.

<p>Me too.  I've been a Licensed Massage Practitioner for 17yrs now, and after 10 years my hands were not only exhausted, but they were starting to develop all sorts of aches and pains from overuse.  I needed a way to give great massages without using my fingers and thumbs to do all the work, and without losing that personal touch of a soothing massage.  I had an idea to design a series of solid stone tools that could be heated or cooled and that worked like extensions of your own hands and fingers, giving the feel of a real massage but with the ""Synergy"" of added radiant heat.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Heat Wave Profound Synergy Stone"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1048.photobucket.com/albums/s374/synergystone/IGG2/ProfoundSynergystone.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So I spent several years testing dozens of specialized shapes until I created <strong>5 perfectly balanced works of funtional art</strong> called <strong>SYNERGY STONES!</strong>  Each SYNERGY STONE is contoured to fit comfortably against the body and in the hand, saving fingers and thumbs while giving an ultra-relaxing massage. For the next two years I practiced with them on friends, and on clients.  SYNERGY STONES were a big hit! And because they worked so well together, giving a ""Synergy"" of warmth, relaxation and healing therapy, I created a new style of Massage altogether...  The HEAT~WAVE!!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""Synergy Stone Tools"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1048.photobucket.com/albums/s374/synergystone/IGG2/IMG_9184.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The HEAT~WAVE Massage is unlike any other massage.  It blends the Soothing Warm qualities of traditional Hot Stone massage with the therapeutic benefits of deeper bodywork.  The HEAT~WAVE's impressive and you have to experience it to believe it.  Until then check out our demo videos at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/SynergyStone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""www.YouTube.com"">www.YouTube.com</a>! </p>

<h2>MASSAGE is IMPORTANT, VALUABLE and VITAL!</h2>
<p>The impact that safe, healing MASSAGE has on people around the world, and on me, is why I became a massage practitioner in the first place. Massage is <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>. Massage feels great, sure. But it's more than that.  Contact in the form of Massage bridges the gap that so many people face these days... the lack of human touch that we want and need, but that we dont always get.  Countless studies have been done showing the <strong>VALUE</strong> of relaxing and therapeutic massage and the effect it has on people. Massage is <strong>VITAL</strong> and needed.  This is why I've dedicated myself to this project, to this vision and to sharing this new an amazing style of HEAT~WAVE Massage with the World!</p>

<h2>HEADING the right DIRECTION...</h2>
<p>My family and I launched SYNERGY STONE LLC this year with a homemade website, homemade videos, and tons of hard work.  Remember, these stone massage tools are made by hand, not by machine!  They are literally from our hands to yours and there's nothing else like them in the entire world.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/SynergyStone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""YouTube"">YouTube</a> has been a big help.  In a short time the HEAT~WAVE Massage has been discovered by Spas around the world.  From Brisbane AU, to Luxembourg, to Tranent UK, to Saudi Arabia, to Moneta VA. and back to Woodinville WA. just outside of Seattle.  And it's just the beginning!  Also, we're excited to announce that starting soon, we'll be offering hands-on workshops, web-cast training classes and DVD training programs to teach professionals and non-professionals the art of the New HEAT~WAVE Massage!  But with growth, comes new challenges...</p>

<h2>We Need a Boost</h2>
<p>The demand for our hand-made SYNERGY STONES is almost more than we can handle.  We need to jump the hurdle and go big.  Financial help from family is wonderful, but when a dream goes big, there are always unforseen expenses.  Now we need a Boost, in order to buy the equipment to ramp up production, hire an employee, finish the patent process, and in return, you'll get something wonderful!! </p>
<p>Get a piece of the HEAT~WAVE Massage Revolution while you can!  Our SYNERGY STONE perks are worth their weight in GOLD, will last a lifetime and will make you or someone you love really happy.  Who doesn't love a Warm, Soothing Massage?!  And shipping is FREE, even international shipping for the bigger perks!  We just couldn't bare the thought of you having to pay for shipping to receive your Perks... No Way! (There are shipping charges for the smaller perks. Sorry!  No way around it..)</p>

<h3>Announcing Clive Barker's The Body Book Coming From Dark Regions Press in 2015</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Dark Regions Press is extremely excited to announce the next release from world renowned imaginer Clive Barker and one of the biggest projects ever to be published by DRP: Clive Barker's The Body Book.</p>
<p>Including two of Clive Barker's classic stories from his groundbreaking collections Books of Blood, ""The Body Politic"" and ""In the Flesh"", exclusive content from the cinematic adaptation of ""The Body Politic"" and detailed information on the ""In the Flesh"" film that never came to be, The Body Book will have award-winning filmmaker Mick Garris (Quicksilver Highway, Masters of Horror, The Stand) joining forces with Clive Barker in an effort to bring fans never-before-seen photos, writings, interviews and much more.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433813060/gg7nvvbardjifplavosh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(Mick Garris, Tobe Hooper, Stephen King and Clive Barker on the set of Sleepwalkers, 1992)<br/><br/>
</div><div><h3>Clive Barker's The Body Book Will Be Available in Three Signed Limited Edition Hardcover Formats for Preorder Starting in Summer of 2015 for Backers of This Indiegogo Campaign and Dark Regions Press Collectors Club Members (Public Preorder in November 2015)</h3></div><div>
<p>Clive Barker's The Body Book will also include paintings and artwork from Clive himself, and possibly (schedule permitting) a new original painting by Clive as the cover artwork created specifically for this project. </p>
<p>Fans and collectors will be pleased to know that The Body Book will be offered in three signed limited edition hardcover formats, similar to those produced for Clive Barker's The Midnight Meat Train Special Definitive Edition. These limited edition hardcovers will have maximum print runs of 500 copies and will be the only signed limited edition copies ever printed of Clive Barker's The Body Book. </p>
<p>Clive Barker's The Body Book is scheduled for a November 2015 public preorder on DarkRegions.com and is expected to sell out extremely fast. <b>Backers of this Indiegogo campaign will get information on an early preorder for Clive Barker's The Body Book this summer before anyone else.</b></p>

<h4>Like a Dead Man Walking by William F. Nolan</h4>
<p>The critically-acclaimed collection Like a Dead Man Walking by living literary legend, World Horror Society Grandmaster and co-author of Logan's Run William F. Nolan was previously only offered in a pricey signed limited hardcover edition format, but Dark Regions Press is publishing the ebook and trade paperback editions this summer including an all-new story, ""A Conversation With the Dark Guy."" Ebook/Trade Paperbacks are included in every Ever-Expanding Grab Bag!<br/><br/>
Working with editor Jason V Brock (Milton’s Children), Nolan brings to shocking life not only debauched murderers and depraved loners, but also fascinating portraits of personal reflection; the heroes of yore in poetry; pages from Nolan’s notebook; and an exclusive, intimate interview with his beloved friend, the late Richard Matheson (I Am Legend).

Like a Dead Man Walking by William F. Nolan
The critically-acclaimed collection Like a Dead Man Walking by living literary legend, World Horror Society Grandmaster and co-author of Logan's Run William F. Nolan was previously only offered in a pricey signed limited hardcover edition format, but Dark Regions Press is publishing the ebook and trade paperback editions this summer including an all-new story, ""A Conversation With the Dark Guy."" Ebook/Trade Paperbacks are included in every Ever-Expanding Grab Bag!
Working with editor Jason V Brock (Milton’s Children), Nolan brings to shocking life not only debauched murderers and depraved loners, but also fascinating portraits of personal reflection; the heroes of yore in poetry; pages from Nolan’s notebook; and an exclusive, intimate interview with his beloved friend, the late Richard Matheson (I Am Legend).













A Mountain Walked: Great Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos Edited by S. T. Joshi
One of the most highly demanded Lovecraftian and weird fiction anthologies of 2014, A Mountain Walked: Great Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos is edited by world renowned Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi and features stories by Neil Gaiman, Caitlín R. Kiernan, Michael Shea, Gemma Files and many more accompanied by the stunning artwork of David Ho.
Previously only offered in a very expensive signed limited edition hardcover format that is now extremely hard to find, Dark Regions Press is publishing the ebook and trade paperback editions of A Mountain Walked and debuting them here in the Ever-Expanding Grab Bag campaign (if our campaign goal is reached).













Moon on the Water and Other Stories Audiobook Written by Mort Castle
We are incredibly excited to be publishing the very first Dark Regions Press audiobook. With stories written by award-winning author Mort Castle and narrated by several talented professional narrators, customers will be delighted at the quality of this audiobook and the deft writing of the stories by the one and only Mort Castle. A digital copy of this audiobook will be included in every grab bag if our first stretch goal is reached.













Discoveries: Best of Horror and Dark Fantasy edited by James R. Beach and Jason V. Brock
This anthology is going to be a big one: featuring a rare story by Ray Bradbury and stories by W.H. Pugmire, John Shirley, Tim Lebbon, John R. Little and many more, this anthology is slated for retail release later this year. Customers who join us in The Ever-Expanding Grab Bag will be receiving a digital copy of this anthology if our third stretch goal is unlocked!

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Meat Factory Clothing is a new lifestyle brand, which creates awareness of the difference, weirdness and
uniqueness that lurks in all of us. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It means that it’s designed for
individuals who are not afraid to express their own provocative originality.</span></p>
<p>Meat Factory Clothing is specialized in T-shirt production based on creating limited collections in which each of them brings out different animal character
in human skin. </p>
<p>Every design is printed in the quantity of 50 pieces in 2 colors (25 + 25). All T-shirts are marked with a specific number, which tells the customer how many T-shirts of the particular collection were made as well as which one he/ she can get. </p>
<p>This is highly limited brand. It means, if you miss your chance now, you won't be able to get your favorite design later. We don't need to see our designs on everybody. We want to see them only on those individuals who are not scared to wear them.</p>
<p>But good news is that after our first collection is sold out, we will come with another one immediately. </p>

<p>In Nepal, contaminated water sources are keeping kids out of school - because of health problems like diarrhoea, because of the need to collect water instead of go to school and because of the lack of sanitation. </p>
<p>Engineers Without Borders Australia is educating people on how to identify clean water and practice good hygiene - this greatly increases the health of communities and the number of children in primary schools. Pledge to send an engineer to Nepal, to help on a project that will provide clean water to 500,000 people in Nepal.</p>

These socks make serious steps toward solving poverty.Help us order the first batch.
We've taken the best quality socks you've ever worn, lovingly crafted them in working conditions of the highest ethical standards, and matched each design in support of a different social cause. 

To get started, we need your help to order 6,000 pairs. In the process, we can feed 6,000 malnourished children, plant 60,000 trees, and contribute to getting clean water to 500,000 people in Nepal!! We'll be releasing photos and information on the impact you 're creating throughout the campaign.












 These socks provide three therapeutic food packets to malnourished children in Sub-Saharan Africa 
We're working to directly support Action Against Hunger's nutrition programs in Kenya, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Pledge now and help us reach our goal of feeding 6,000 children! 












These socks plant 30 trees in rural Ghana. 
We're working with Trees for the Future to plant trees and teach agroforestry technologies to the women and children to develop income generation, provide material for fuel and food, and protect the environment. Pledge now and help us reach our goal of planting 60,000 trees!

  Sandstone Gold w/ Tan Strap We’re using the best materials and components we can find to build an excessively quality watch. Italian Natural Leather, Swiss Ronda, and 316L Stainless Steel, to name a few.    Graphite Steel w/ Black Strap This isn’t our first rodeo. The Quarter Century Watch will be our third watch collection to be created by crowdfunding.  Our network of manufacturing partners is reliable, from the hand-made cases to the slide box packaging that the watch arrives in.    By offering the QCW directly via Indiegogo we are able to cut out the retail channel, middlemen markups, brand exclusivity/scarcity, and offer a $450 watch for a quarter of the price. Seriously, try to find a better watch for a better price, and we’ll match it.A closer look at other options... We've designed the QCW to be the best possible option out there. We were never satisfied with the options presented to us, and you can easily see why.QCW w/ tan strap  We wanted an excessively high quality, handmade watch useful & durable enough for everyday wear. The QCW is beautifully crafted for timelessness with a less is more approach to ensure durability and longevity. A classic minimal look without unnecessary features or fancy dials.  Our minimal design ensures a durable construction for years to come. QCW is sized for women as well! THESE WATCHES ARE BACKED BY A 25 YEAR GUARANTEEFirst and foremost, these watches are built to last. You can finally get peace of mind. We're so confident that your Quarter Century Watch will be the most durable, everyday wear you'll ever own that we are backing them with a 25 year guarantee.  OVERVIEW : Built to last with premium components, minimalism, structural balance, and ergonomics in mind. We chose a case with a convex design for optimal fit and comfort in everyday wear. Sometimes watches can protrude and dig into the metacarpal bones, causing discomfort in daily activities. Not the Quarter Century Watch. Furthermore, the crown is generally the most uncomfortable part of a watch for everyday wearers. We opted for a 4PM crown position to solve this issue.This design allows for your wrist to move and flex naturally without even the slightest abrasion. With the 4PM crown, you never have to deal with the discomfort of the crown and case digging into your metacarpal bones. No more minor long-term bruising, scratching of the skin, or deformities. This watch will truly be the most comfortable, ergonomic timepiece you own. You can’t expect to have reliability at the highest level without a functional foundation and solid construction. We wanted to keep the case minimal, at only 7mm thick and 41mm in diameter. To increase durability while maintaining a lightweight construction, we decided on a 316L steel case. This allows for a strong case that is also a perfect weight to the touch. It is the industry standard when it comes to luxury watches.  It will hold up in daily use for over 25 years, guaranteed.  The case is to be sandblasted first, to have all the edges softened, but also brushed on the bezel, to offer a distinct, durable surface. It is 41 mm, which is a versatile size for any occasion.   Our designers and engineers have worked tirelessly to perfect this watch. In designing, we wanted to keep the watch functional and easy to read. An ultra minimal 2-hand analog face function was exactly all we needed.  When it comes to the watch that we designed for everyday wear for over 25 years, functionality was key. This is the epitome of enduring craftsmanship.  QCW w/ tan strap   While we don’t like to make light of potential risks for a watch in the field, our designers did just that. To top off a dependable construction, we will use the best crystal we have to offer. The highly demanded sapphire crystal, from the last project, comes standard with all Quarter Century Watches. Sapphire crystals are made from minerals grown in furnaces. When the resulting material is removed from this, it’s not in the large sheets that glass emerges in, but rather in big blocks called “boules.”    With our signature compass triangle at the 12 o'clock position, the Quarter Century Watch is a product of minimal design and understated precision detailing.  Every single minute detail of this timepiece was considered, from the spacing used between lettering, to the precision lume stripes on our hand markers. It is truly a product of purpose and precision.   The 316L steel backplate is secured with four steel screws. Logo and specifications are precision lasered after a classic brush finish.    Our vegetable-tanned leather is finished the old-fashioned way- with very little artificial treatment. This natural Italian leather is only minimally treated with a blend of organic oils and waxes to give it the perfect touch, and a spark of life. The raw leather will build character to develop a beautiful tone over the years with your wear.   Our dyed leather will also break in to become soft and supple over time for comfortable daily wear. Additional strap options like tan leather will be available for add-on following the campaign.    Time is our constant companion, but even the most extravagant watch needs a reliable movement to keep it in regular motion. And Switzerland has earned itself an enviable reputation as a manufacturer of the finest watch movements. RONDA Ronda has been committed to time for decades now. And the company today is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of precision electronic watch movements of innovative design. As a family-owned company that is now in second-generation hands, Ronda attaches great value to maintaining its full independence. Their movements are debatably the most accurate in the world and built to last for many years.  As an added convenience, lume is subtly added to the hands to allow easy visibility at all times.   With lume precisely painted onto the hands, your watch can be read easily when transitioning from bright to low light conditions. The watch will charge itself during the day and remain lit while in low light conditions.  OFFERED IN 3 CASE STYLES:

SANDSTONE GOLD // A timeless white dial on a gold case w/ natural leather strap.

PHANTOM BLACK // An upscale black on black look.

GRAPHITE STEEL // A classic steel finish w/ natural leather strap for a subtle everyday wear.

We visited their facility in the Summer of 2014 in detailed tours, and again in January 2015.With multiple stages in the manufacture and quality check process, we are confident in their ability to deliver a quality product. We were impressed with their sophisticated manufacture process including different rooms for assembly, air pressure checkpoints, water pressure stations, 48-hour timekeeping accuracy test, and (of course) a drop test. All of their facilities meet all necessary regulation and code for operation.Though they host the manufacturing of many large retail brands, the general managers made sure all of our requirements were met and accommodated. Their experienced staff and attention to detail was what made our decision to choose them so easy. We, at Elliot Havok, are extremely confident they will meet our needs.We will offer the Havok watch at wholesale pricing with radical transparency. Not only should the watch be priced so that nobody breaks their bank, but what goes into the watch should be disclosed. You’ll know when we can make changes, add-ons, or stretch goals. But honestly, we really don’t know where we can improve this modern masterpiece.SPECIFICATIONS:

 We drew inspiration for the ""Quarter Century"" idea from our very first Elliot Havok Kickstarter- The Quarter Century Belt. The idea of something built to last over 25 Years was ambitious at first, but we wanted to build the reputation to create quality products, for a fraction of our competitors' prices. Kickstarter responded, and we were able to fund our very first project.Then, in 2014, we launched the first Havok Watch Collection, becoming the most backed watch on Kickstarter with 4500 backers. And last year our Racer Chronograph raised over $350,000. We were only able to do so by offering the best product for the best price. Basically “the best bang for your buck”. We will never overcharge and dump ridiculous retail markups onto our supporters. We adamantly dislike when high designer markups are just passed onto the consumer.Furthermore, we will offer the Havok watch at wholesale pricing with radical transparency, inspired by Everlane. Not only should the watch be priced so that nobody breaks their bank, but everything that goes into the watch should be disclosed.This is absolutely the best watch, for the best price- bar none.HAVOK TIMEPIECES ARE BACKED WITH A WARRANTYWe believe in our watches, and you should too. If anything were to happen to your watch, we hope that you will send it back to us for repair or replacement. We will cover all internal parts should they ever fail you. They are built so well, that we will cover them for 25 years. POST-FUNDINGThis is where Indiegogo comes in. We need your continued support to launch this specific line of watches. We are raising funding specifically for further R&D, manufacturing, packaging, and logistics for the QCW Havok Timepiece collection. Your support for the production of these affordable, quality watches will also make them available to all in the future. And of course, you will be the first to own a Havok Quarter Century Watch. Thank you for taking the time to check out the project.Elliot Havok consists of a diverse team of creative product designers with cross-functional skills within the fields of design, development, and manufacturing. Our team encompasses over 20 years of combined experience in bringing innovative products to life. Steven will be spearheading the design and development of the QCW collection, while Bryan and Joe supervise logistics, communications, and backer relations. With the support of the rest of our experienced team including industrial and graphic designers, we are ready to build you a product that you can proudly support.                       HI-RES GALLERY: HERE",85.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>In general, Morph T-shirts provide a more accurate fit and pronounced V-shape with every body type. This is because of our technology, the integration of data with high end tailoring techniques and the Golden ratio. It's not just about fit anymore, we took it a step beyond. Here's some more details of our T-shirts with their explanation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472558745/ik0up3vwff2ovsuiug0d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Because sizes are not the same from one brand to another it can be very difficult and frustrating to buy clothing online. We've solved this problem by developing a sizing system that's based on your specific body type and height.  </p>
<p>The result is a super easy and efficient sizing experience: it takes barely 30 seconds and 2 clicks to find your right size. So you won't have problems with finding your size or returning badly fitted clothing anymore.  </p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p> So the process of finding your right size is efficient AND fun.   </p>
<p>The problem of badly fitted clothing is especially troubling when it comes to guys that are bigger or smaller than the average. </p>

<p>As we are just starting up and offering our T-shirts at highly discounted prices on Kickstarter, we won’t be able to accept returns. If however you wish to exchange your shirt for any reason, it is possible but you’ll have to pay for the two way shipping.</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Le produit en lui-même est prêt, mais maintenant nous avons besoin du soutien de la communauté Kickstarter pour atteindre notre objectif et couvrir nos coûts.  Si nous y arrivons, nous souhaitons utiliser cette technologie pour l'appliquer à tout le vestiaire masculin: pulls, chemises et vestes.  Nous comptons l'appliquer pour le vestiaire féminin à horizon 2019.  Voici ce dont nous avons besoin auprès de la communauté Kickstarter pour lancer la production et couvrir nos futurs coûts de développement:Selon nous, le meilleur moyen de vous montrer la différence entre nos t-shirts et les t-shirts ordinaires est tout simplement de les comparer.  On a donc invité des modèles minces, costauds et athlétiques à notre studio en leur demandant d'amener leur t-shirt favori. Puis on a fait les photos avant/après dont vous pouvez voir les résultats ci-dessous:  (PS: Pour les plus sceptiques d'entre vous, les photos ont été prises selon les mêmes conditions.)Modèle N°1: Mince - Ectomorphe           Modèle mince - Vue de devantLa silhouette en V de Michele est bien plus accentuée. ""J'ai l'air beaucoup plus costaud et moins maigrichon""            Modèle mince - Vue de côtéIci le torse de Michele semble plus large.            Modèle mince - Vue de dosA la place d'une silhouette mince, les muscles du dos et les trapèzes sont bien plus accentués.  Modèle N°2: Athlétique - Mésomorphe           Modèle athlétique - Vue de devantRaphael fait parti des rares chanceux à avoir un torse naturellement en V. Pourtant, même avec sa silhouette, on voit bien que le cou, le torse et les trapèzes sont bien plus prononcés. La longueur du t-shirt est également bien plus adaptée que le M classique.            Modèle athlétique - Vue de côtéLe t-shirt est généralement plus ajusté et les bras semblent clairement plus musclés grâce à la manche en biais.            Modèle athlétique - Vue de dosIci encore, le haut du dos est accentué et la taille réduite. Selon Raphael: ""Mon dos a l'air incroyable ! Je ressemble à Michael Phelps ! ""Modèle N°3: Costaud - Endomorphe           Modèle costaud - Vue de devantPierre a une silhouette bien plus élancée et définie ici. Selon lui, "" C'est comme si j'avais perdu 10 kg juste en changeant de t-shirts""            Modèle costaud - Vue de côtéVu de côté, le torse de Pierre est plus prononcé, son ventre est plus mince et ses bras plus définies.            Modèle costaud - Vue de dosLes trapèzes de Pierre sont accentués et il semble bien plus mince.De manière générale, les t-shirts Morph permettent un fit plus précis et accentuent le V du torse pour chaque morphologie. C'est ce que permet notre technologie: la prise en compte de nombreuses données différentes sur les morphologies combinées à des techniques sartoriales et à l'intégration du nombre d'or. Nous sommes allés beaucoup plus loin que simplement définir une bonne coupe. Voici quelques explications à partir des détails de nos t-shirts:Il est souvent compliqué de trouver la bonne taille lorsqu'on achète en ligne (surtout qu'elles varient d'une marque à une autre). Nous avons résolu ce problème en développant un système de taille basé sur votre morphologie et votre taille. L'expérience finale est simple et fun: vous trouvez votre taille en à peine 30 secondes et 2 clics. Plus besoin de renvoyer des achats à la mauvaise taille.  Voici comment ça marche:Le problème des vêtements mal coupés ou à la mauvaise taille est perturbant pour ceux qui sont un peu plus gros ou un peu plus petits que la moyenne. Voici ce que nous ont apprit ceux qui sont venus au showroom:Avec nos neuf tailles différentes, chaque morphologie est prise en compte et personne n'est laissé de côté.  On ne sait pas ce qu'il en est pour vous, mais en ce qui nous concerne ça ne nous flatte pas spécialement d'être un XS ou un XXXL. C’est pourquoi nous avons voulu créer un système de tailles plus amusant, inspiré de la mythologie grecque.  Chez nous, toutes les tailles (qu’on appelle Archétypes) sont représentées par un héros ou un dieu de la Grèce Antique, illustré par un symbole.  Ce symbole illustre le principal accomplissement du héros. Ces étiquettes de taille seront placées sur la manche droite, comme vous le voyez sur cette photo:Nous espérons obtenir beaucoup de réactions et d'interactions amusées grâce à ce nouveau système de taille bien plus fun et attractif.  PS: Pas besoin de choisir votre archétype pour le moment. Une fois le Kickstarter terminé nous enverrons un mail individuel à tous nos soutiens pour déterminer votre morphologie.  PPS: Le système Morph est pertinent dans tous les continents et pour toutes les différentes morphologies: d'un grand Viking à un petit samurai.


 



us ne devriez du coup pas avoir de soucis pour trouver la bonne taille pour votre t-shirt. Si néanmoins vous souhaitez échanger votre t-shirt, pour n'importe quelle raison, c'est possible mais nous ne pourrons pas vous rembourser les frais de retours.  
Etant donné que nous commençons et que nos t-shirts sont distribués à un prix déjà fortement réduit, nous ne pourrons malheureusement pas accepter les retours.

       
The invention itself is made, but we now need the support of the Kickstarter crowd to reach our funding goal so we can start production and cover future development costs. 
If you help us succeed, we will be taking this technology and apply it to other male garments, such as jumpers, shirts and jackets. We aim to apply the same system and fit for women by 2019.



We found that the best way for us to show you the difference between our T-shirts and 'normal ones' is to literally compare them. So we invited a lean, stocky and athletic model to the studio and asked them to bring their favourite T-shirt. Then we made Before and After pictures. Check out the results below.  
PS: for the sceptics among you, the pictures were taken under the same conditions. 
 
Model Nr 1: Lean - Ectomorph

            Lean model - front view
You can see that Michele's got more of a V-shape and in his words 'I look much bigger. Less of a skinny guy'. 

 Lean model - profile
 Here Michele's chest looks more broad. 

 Lean model - back view
Instead of his usual lean figure, Michele's back and lateral muscles look much bigger. 
Model Nr 2: Athletic - Mesomorph

 Athletic model - front view
Raphael is one of the lucky ones with his naturally V-shaped body. However, even with him you can see that his neck, chest and trapezius muscles stand out more. The length of the T-shirt is also more suited to him, instead of his classical Medium.

 Athletic model - profile
The T-shirt looks better fitted in general and his arm looks more muscular thanks to the curved sleeve.

 Athletic model - back view
Here you see that the top of his back looks more broad and his waist looks slimmer. In Raphael's words: 'Man, my back looks amazing! I look like Michael Phelps'.  
Model Nr 3: Stocky - Endomorph

 Stocky model - front view
Pierre has got a much leaner and more defined figure here. In his words 'It looks like I've lost 10kg just by changing T-shirts'.

 Stocky model - profile
From the side, Pierre's chest has more bulk to it, his belly is slimmer and his arms more defined.

 Stocky model - back view
Pierre looks like he has got a bigger upper back and slimmer waist.

On top of that, we don’t know many guys that actually like to be an XS or XXXL, ourselves included. That’s why we decided to make a more inspiring sizing experience.
Using Greek mythology, we've developed a much cooler system where every size, or Archetype as we call it, is represented by an Ancient Greek Hero or God, illustrated by a symbol on the sleeve. So whichever your body type, everyone gets to be a Boss.


We hope that with this fun detail, people will feel proud of who they are and relate to each other in a more positive way.

<p><b>Comma Fashion Showcase</b> is an independent show held by <b>fashion design and fashion marketing graduates</b> from the <b>Savannah College of Art And Design (SCAD), Hong Kong</b>. This showcase - which features a capsule collection from each of the <b>seven designers</b> - will be the <b>first time</b> these young, fresh talents will present their exciting work to the public.</p>
<p>The meaning of the Comma has a symbolic significance. The Comma not the end of a sentence; instead, it is the continuation of it. In the same way, this fashion showcase does not signify the end; rather, it stands for a <b>new chapter in their creative careers</b>.</p>
<p><span>The purpose of the showcase is not simply to show off new work. Through this showcase, the designers aim to inspire others within the fashion industry, as well as any young individual who inspires to be a part of this dynamic and exciting field.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our event will be held on <b>23 June</b> at <b>The Annex in Central</b>, followed by a show in the <b>Apple store </b>at<b> Tsim Sha Tsui</b> the next day. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The showcase will also be a used as a means to educate the viewer about the complexities behind fashion design by featuring not just the finished products, but also the process behind each designer’s collection. Sketchbooks featuring fabric samples and rough sketches will be available to the public for viewing. By doing this, the showcase aims to take the visitors on an amazing journey from a few simple concepts to beautiful garments on the runway.</span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What we need</h3> <p>As this is the <b>first fashion show</b> we are <b>organising by ourselves</b>, we are basically running the show from the production to marketing. With the kind help from fellow students, creatives and volunteers, we are able to put this show together. We also have found several sponsors for the event space, sound system and Hong Kong Fur Federation has graciously provided partial financial sponsorship. However, the simple show will still incur <b>basic costs</b> we cannot get sponsors for: </p> <ul> <li>Makeup for two shows and 15 models: USD1500</li>
<li>Food &amp; drinks for 10 volunteers and 15 models: USD1500</li> <li>Printing of look books and collaterals: USD500</li> <li>Security for the event, transportation of our collections, visual merchandising for the show: USD500</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><b>Every bit of your contribution would help us</b>. This is the first and only time that all our graduate collections will be shown in its entirety to friends, family and more importantly, the<b> local Hong Kong fashion industry professionals</b>. <b>It may actually be the only time this would happen!</b> Your contributions would not only help <b>seven designers</b> to have a successful event but aid in supporting crew of <b>three marketing students</b>. </p>
<p>To express our appreciation for your help, we have designed three leather products- earphone holder, coin pouch and card holder- which we will make and send to you as a 'thank you'! </p>

<p><b>Comma Fashion Showcase</b><span>是由香港薩凡納藝術設計大學的時裝設計及</span>時裝行銷及管理系畢業生所舉辦的一個展示會。時裝展羅列了七名年輕、具天份的設計師之作品，亦是他們首次向公眾展示其激動人心的作品。</p>
<p><span>Comma <span>不是一句句子的結尾，相反，它是一句句子的延續。同樣道理，此時裝展並不是意味着結束，而是開展設計師們創作生涯新的一頁。</span></span></p>
<p>時裝展目的不是單純展示新設計，而是希望能激勵從事時裝行業的人士，及鼓舞任何對此領域有興趣的年輕人。</p>
<p>是次時裝展將於6<span>月23日於中環別館舉行，翌日移師尖沙嘴Apple Shop。通過今次演出，希望傳遞一個訊息給大家：時裝設計背後是一個大考驗，由設計者的構思，物料的選用至完成一件作品。藉此，</span>大家能了解我們所用的質料，怎樣由簡單的概念變成一件走在天橋上的服裝。</p>
<p><b><span>我們的需要</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>這是我們自行組織的第一個從基本生產到行銷的時裝展。期間得到同學們、創作人員及自願人員的幫助，才能做好這次展出。我們還得到一些贊助商提供活動場地，音響系統及香港毛皮業協會慷慨地提供了部分財政贊助。然而，我們仍需為下列基本費用籌集資金︰</p>

Comma Fashion Showcase is an independent show held by fashion design and fashion marketing graduates from the Savannah College of Art And Design (SCAD), Hong Kong. This showcase - which features a capsule collection from each of the seven designers - will be the first time these young, fresh talents will present their exciting work to the public.
The meaning of the Comma has a symbolic significance. The Comma not the end of a sentence; instead, it is the continuation of it. In the same way, this fashion showcase does not signify the end; rather, it stands for a new chapter in their creative careers.
The purpose of the showcase is not simply to show off new work. Through this showcase, the designers aim to inspire others within the fashion industry, as well as any young individual who inspires to be a part of this dynamic and exciting field.
Our event will be held on 23 June at The Annex in Central, followed by a show in the Apple store at Tsim Sha Tsui the next day. The showcase will also be a used as a means to educate the viewer about the complexities behind fashion design by featuring not just the finished products, but also the process behind each designer’s collection. Sketchbooks featuring fabric samples and rough sketches will be available to the public for viewing. By doing this, the showcase aims to take the visitors on an amazing journey from a few simple concepts to beautiful garments on the runway.
   What we need As this is the first fashion show we are organising by ourselves, we are basically running the show from the production to marketing. With the kind help from fellow students, creatives and volunteers, we are able to put this show together. We also have found several sponsors for the event space, sound system and Hong Kong Fur Federation has graciously provided partial financial sponsorship. However, the simple show will still incur basic costs we cannot get sponsors for:   Makeup for two shows and 15 models: USD1500
Food & drinks for 10 volunteers and 15 models: USD1500 Printing of look books and collaterals: USD500 Security for the event, transportation of our collections, visual merchandising for the show: USD500    The Impact Every bit of your contribution would help us. This is the first and only time that all our graduate collections will be shown in its entirety to friends, family and more importantly, the local Hong Kong fashion industry professionals. It may actually be the only time this would happen! Your contributions would not only help seven designers to have a successful event but aid in supporting crew of three marketing students. 
To express our appreciation for your help, we have designed three leather products- earphone holder, coin pouch and card holder- which we will make and send to you as a 'thank you'! 
To learn more about our showcase, you can visit our website and RSVP to our event. Do feel free to ask us any questions and we will get back to you as soon as possible!
Thank you for your support!

Comma Fashion Showcase

Comma Fashion Showcase是由香港薩凡納藝術設計大學的時裝設計及時裝行銷及管理系畢業生所舉辦的一個展示會。時裝展羅列了七名年輕、具天份的設計師之作品，亦是他們首次向公眾展示其激動人心的作品。
Comma 不是一句句子的結尾，相反，它是一句句子的延續。同樣道理，此時裝展並不是意味着結束，而是開展設計師們創作生涯新的一頁。
時裝展目的不是單純展示新設計，而是希望能激勵從事時裝行業的人士，及鼓舞任何對此領域有興趣的年輕人。
是次時裝展將於6月23日於中環別館舉行，翌日移師尖沙嘴Apple Shop。通過今次演出，希望傳遞一個訊息給大家：時裝設計背後是一個大考驗，由設計者的構思，物料的選用至完成一件作品。藉此，大家能了解我們所用的質料，怎樣由簡單的概念變成一件走在天橋上的服裝。
我們的需要

這是我們自行組織的第一個從基本生產到行銷的時裝展。期間得到同學們、創作人員及自願人員的幫助，才能做好這次展出。我們還得到一些贊助商提供活動場地，音響系統及香港毛皮業協會慷慨地提供了部分財政贊助。然而，我們仍需為下列基本費用籌集資金︰



兩場演出的15名模特兒及化妝：USD1500


10名自願人員及15名模特兒的膳食：USD1500


印刷Lookbook及保證金：USD500


是次活動保安、展品運輸、推廣：USD500


你們每一分的支持都是對我們的幫忙。是次演出是我們的首次也是唯一一次向我們的家人和朋友，更重要的，是向本地時裝工業展示我們的作品。就此一次，不但使7位設計者夢想成真，亦是對3名時裝行銷及管理系同學的支持。
為答謝您的幫忙，我們設計了3款皮具產品 － 耳筒套、硬幣包及卡套以表謝意！

<h3>OUR STORY </h3>
<p>Hi! We're Charlotte and Sherene, co-creators of CoIX (pronounced COY). We're two proudly tall women who wear size UK 11/US 13/EU 46 footwear and have found the shoe shopping experience challenging and disheartening, to say the least. We grew frustrated with the lack of choices, poor fit and quality, and uninspiring styles and color options in footwear for our size. As modern, professional women we often wished we could also express our style confidently beyond our ankles. We resolved to create a solution to allow us to express our style and individuality from head to toe. <i><strong>#COIXshoesmystyle </strong></i></p>
<p>Although we have different style compasses, we would agree our true North isn't guided by trends. CoIX was created out of a need for effortlessly chic footwear that transcends trends for people like us.</p>
<p>We want to create an uplifting shoe shopping experience and can't wait to see you excited about pulling together your whole look with CoIX shoes being the cherry on top! Choose your perfect pair of CoIX shoes to bring your next ensemble to life, whether it’s an important meeting you need to stand tall for or a night out on the town. CoIX shoes is here to finally help complete your style story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT COIX </h3>
<p>CoIX is the footwear brand we (and you) have been longing for. A well-designed pair of quality made shoes is hard to come by. This could not be truer for people who wear larger shoe sizes, uncatered to and overlooked by mainstream fashion and footwear brands. We have struggled for years to find shoes that spoke to our fashion senses and versatile lifestyles. We found shoes that were trendy, but fit poorly, or made for comfort at the expense of style. CoIX (pronounced COY) was founded from our desire to have footwear that fulfilled all of these criteria. We also deserve the quality and array of choices in footwear that people who wear standard sizes have access to.</p>
<p>We launched CoIX to give you essential heels (and flats coming soon) to reclaim the shoe shopping and wearing experience for people like us, making it fun and pleasurable instead of an unfulfilling mission.</p>
<p>CoIX shoes offers smart, contemporary style combined with supreme craftsmanship. Our debut capsule collection showcases modern styles meet classic silhouettes, designed to be transeasonal footwear staples. Each pair is handcrafted in Spain to a high standard of quality. Perfect for all-day wear thanks to supreme cushion insoles that support your feet with each step. No longer will you need to sacrifice beauty for wearability, or accept the pain of beautiful shoes.</p>
<p>We are starting with just three sizes UK 9, 10 and 11 (US 11, 12 and 13 / EU 44, 45 and 46) with plans to expand to half sizes and wide widths in the future. We have found that shoe sizes vary from store to store, often running too small! You will find that our shoes run true to size, if not a little generously. Please see the size chart below to see if we have the right size for you.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>We are a team of engineers, designers, and creators who have represented some of the largest and respected retail brands in the world. We are excited to continue the same work, but as entrepreneurs building a brand we are passionate about. We're focused on bringing together distinct designs, comfort, and quality craftsmanship with each one of our products, and to start we're launching with a line of sunglasses we're really proud of.</p>
<p><strong>This campaign represents the start of a brand and the culmination of many years dedicated to our craft. </strong>With your support, we'll be able to continue on this journey together.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Values</h3>
<p><u><strong>Our Approach to Craftsmanship</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493780996/zva1dct2hbwbm3jmeenf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are extremely proud of our designs and believe that it takes special craftsmanship to bring them to life. So we took them to the only place in the world we believed could accomplish this. Japan, a manufacturing culture known for precision, reliability, and durability. Where production is truly art. The Japanese have a saying, <strong>Shokunin</strong>, which means <i><strong>mastery of one’s craft</strong></i>.</p>
<p>Our journey brought us to a small coastal town 300 miles outside of Tokyo. A region notorious for expert sword making since the 14th century, craftsmen here have also been producing high-end optical frames for decades. After nearly a year of developing, iterating, and improving our prototypes with a team of master craftsmen, we're finally confident in putting our frames into the hands of our backers.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Approach to Lenses</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494211688/hahei73t4bwaprizbywa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We're bringing something completely new to the sunglass game with our<strong> Blackout Lenses</strong>, which are manufactured using a proprietary process that combines a UV light-adaptive layer with our signature Smoke Tint. The result: your glasses will have our signature Smoke Tint in the shade or indoors, but will quickly transform under direct sunlight. To those checking you out, your Blackout Lenses will have a richer, deeper and darker hue, giving you <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>a distinct look that no other pair of sunglasses offer today. And by adapting to your surroundings, these lenses actually </span>help combat eye strain and glare no matter how powerful the direct sunlight is.</p>
<p><strong>We don't believe in distorting your vision or adding excessive flair to our lenses.</strong> All of our lenses are designed to decrease glare while maintaining true color perception. They are all UV 400, offering the highest quality of protection on the market today by blocking out 100% of UVA and UVB light.</p>
<p>All of our lenses are made with a dense synthetic resin that offers the clarity and durability of glass while remaining extremely light (half the weight of glass) and shatter-resistant. </p>
<p><u><strong>Our Approach to Comfort</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494208731/fwoyes0xdxigox8wppan.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want our glasses to be so comfortable that you forget you're even wearing them. Light, balanced, and flexible. Many brands today are promoting frames made of exotic materials like walnut wood or bamboo. These often look great, but bottom line is they are extremely unforgiving and usually uncomfortable, like wearing a pair of picture frames on your face. We've stuck to time-tested materials like high-grade titanium, known for ultralight comfort. 30% stronger than steel, but nearly 50% lighter.</p>
<p><u><b>Our Approach to Style</b></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493871752/dtwrxciww94npa3olbwa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Many of us are still rocking the same sunglass styles that were popular over 30 years ago. But everything else around us has changed. We've dropped the baggy jeans, the cargo shorts, and the fat ties. We believe it's time to step up our sunglass game as well. We're inspired by classic designs, but strive to create fresh, contemporary styles without the excessive flair. <strong>Let's say farewell to the Wayfarer.</strong></p>
<p><b><u>Our Approach to Quality</u></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492900493/kkstigr26vdiahl6jdjz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We believe in only creating products we can stand behind. Too many brands today take advantage of loose product-labeling laws to convince their customers that their products are better simply because their label says they're ""Made In"" a country we associate with quality. Many glasses on the market, however, are actually mass produced in a different country from the one their label boasts, only to be shipped elsewhere for final labeling and packaging.</p>
<p>Our sunglasses are actually <strong>Made in Japan</strong>. Every part we source is from Japan, and our final products are 100% hand-assembled in Japan. Rigorous quality inspections are conducted after each stage of the manufacturing process, which means that every pair of our sunglasses is <strong>crafted with confidence</strong>.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Approach to Price</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493614926/phevvtwcfkqb56onzlrg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There's no doubt that many luxury &amp; designer products are made with superior materials. But most of the premium we pay as consumers is for the brand (read more about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Veblen goods</a>).</p>
<p>We don't believe in price inflation. We're about building a sustainable, mission-based company that strives to deliver the very best products to our customers at price points that are accessible. We will only sell our products direct-to-consumer to ensure we are passing as much of the savings as we can to our customers. Compare our prices to other amazing sunglass brands handcrafted in Japan like <a href=""https://dita.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dita</a> and <a href=""http://www.bartonperreira.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barton Perreira</a>, which average well over $400 at retail.</p>

</div></div>","Our Mission
We are a team of engineers, designers, and creators who have represented some of the largest and respected retail brands in the world. We are excited to continue the same work, but as entrepreneurs building a brand we are passionate about. We're focused on bringing together distinct designs, comfort, and quality craftsmanship with each one of our products, and to start we're launching with a line of sunglasses we're really proud of.
This campaign represents the start of a brand and the culmination of many years dedicated to our craft. With your support, we'll be able to continue on this journey together.
 
Our Values
Our Approach to Craftsmanship

We are extremely proud of our designs and believe that it takes special craftsmanship to bring them to life. So we took them to the only place in the world we believed could accomplish this. Japan, a manufacturing culture known for precision, reliability, and durability. Where production is truly art. The Japanese have a saying, Shokunin, which means mastery of one’s craft.
Our journey brought us to a small coastal town 300 miles outside of Tokyo. A region notorious for expert sword making since the 14th century, craftsmen here have also been producing high-end optical frames for decades. After nearly a year of developing, iterating, and improving our prototypes with a team of master craftsmen, we're finally confident in putting our frames into the hands of our backers.
Our Approach to Lenses

We're bringing something completely new to the sunglass game with our Blackout Lenses, which are manufactured using a proprietary process that combines a UV light-adaptive layer with our signature Smoke Tint. The result: your glasses will have our signature Smoke Tint in the shade or indoors, but will quickly transform under direct sunlight. To those checking you out, your Blackout Lenses will have a richer, deeper and darker hue, giving you a distinct look that no other pair of sunglasses offer today. And by adapting to your surroundings, these lenses actually help combat eye strain and glare no matter how powerful the direct sunlight is.
We don't believe in distorting your vision or adding excessive flair to our lenses. All of our lenses are designed to decrease glare while maintaining true color perception. They are all UV 400, offering the highest quality of protection on the market today by blocking out 100% of UVA and UVB light.
All of our lenses are made with a dense synthetic resin that offers the clarity and durability of glass while remaining extremely light (half the weight of glass) and shatter-resistant. 
Our Approach to Comfort

We want our glasses to be so comfortable that you forget you're even wearing them. Light, balanced, and flexible. Many brands today are promoting frames made of exotic materials like walnut wood or bamboo. These often look great, but bottom line is they are extremely unforgiving and usually uncomfortable, like wearing a pair of picture frames on your face. We've stuck to time-tested materials like high-grade titanium, known for ultralight comfort. 30% stronger than steel, but nearly 50% lighter.
Our Approach to Style

Many of us are still rocking the same sunglass styles that were popular over 30 years ago. But everything else around us has changed. We've dropped the baggy jeans, the cargo shorts, and the fat ties. We believe it's time to step up our sunglass game as well. We're inspired by classic designs, but strive to create fresh, contemporary styles without the excessive flair. Let's say farewell to the Wayfarer.
Our Approach to Quality

We believe in only creating products we can stand behind. Too many brands today take advantage of loose product-labeling laws to convince their customers that their products are better simply because their label says they're ""Made In"" a country we associate with quality. Many glasses on the market, however, are actually mass produced in a different country from the one their label boasts, only to be shipped elsewhere for final labeling and packaging.
Our sunglasses are actually Made in Japan. Every part we source is from Japan, and our final products are 100% hand-assembled in Japan. Rigorous quality inspections are conducted after each stage of the manufacturing process, which means that every pair of our sunglasses is crafted with confidence.
Our Approach to Price

There's no doubt that many luxury & designer products are made with superior materials. But most of the premium we pay as consumers is for the brand (read more about Veblen goods).
We don't believe in price inflation. We're about building a sustainable, mission-based company that strives to deliver the very best products to our customers at price points that are accessible. We will only sell our products direct-to-consumer to ensure we are passing as much of the savings as we can to our customers. Compare our prices to other amazing sunglass brands handcrafted in Japan like Dita and Barton Perreira, which average well over $400 at retail.

<p>The Calendar Watch allows you to be on top of your game and gives you the ability to better manage your time.</p>
<p>The watch can also save you time because you are not constantly opening calendars for quick checks and it allows you to focus on what you should be doing. It is an efficiency tool to define your work life. Multitasking drops an average man’s IQ by 15 points (source: Stanford).</p>

<p>Nobody likes the guy who is constantly checking his phone at a restaurant, regardless of what’s so important on the screen. Don’t be that guy, yet still know what’s happening in your calendar. On average, a smartphone owner checks their phone 221 times a day (in UK, source: Tecmark) and we think that’s a bit too much.</p>
<p><b>The battery of the Calendar Watch lasts for weeks and keeps your schedule with you, even when your smartphone dies.</b></p>

<p>The watch features two distinct modes, FIXED and FLEXIBLE, and you can switch between the modes with our accompanying App.</p>
<p>In FLEXIBLE mode the display will be updated segment by segment every 15 minutes, following the hour hand. In this mode, you always see the <b>next </b>12 hours:</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.giphy.com/3o6ozr1l0SqDxA2c48.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With FIXED mode, the display is completely updated every 12 hours and you can set the starting hour in our App. You can choose what you want the watch to show, for example maybe your work day from 9AM to 9PM, or 7AM to 7PM:<br/></p>
<b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.giphy.com/l3V0tUqPfj2jrWllm.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>It’s up to you!</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460381421/banner_0.15_rpr1bw.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><b>Automatic Time Syncing</b></p>
<p>The analog movements of the watch are synced with the digital components and the App. So the hands are automatically adjusted to the right time - even when you travel to different time zones.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Tapping Input</b> </p>
<p>By double tapping the watch, it shows your next 12-24h schedule for 5 seconds in both fixed and flexible modes. The watch also vibrates for 0.3 seconds as feedback. After, the display refreshes again and displays your 0-12h schedule.</p>
<p>With a triple tap your schedule is synced immediately with your phone (otherwise the watch automatically syncs every 15 minutes). The watch responds with two 0.3 second vibrations and an animation.</p>
<p>When in airplane mode, a triple tap will wake up the watch and turn on the Bluetooth.</p>
<p><b>Power Saving</b></p>
<p>When the watch has not detected any movement for 15 minutes, the watch enters its power-saving mode. This is visualized by the second hand stopping at the 12 o’clock position, while the hour and minute hands will continue to show the time. As soon as motion is detected, the second hand will jump to the correct time.</p>
<p><b>Notifications</b></p>
<p>The watch notifies you by vibrating and by flashing the particular event segment according the alert time you have set on your calendar.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.giphy.com/xT1XGQLaM9IOkY9fKE.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>

<p>From the beginning, it was crucial that the watch should not become another device that needed charge daily. Even with continuous syncing with the digital calendar we have been able to make the battery last for weeks, 3 of them we are confident to say! The watch keeps your calendar even when your smartphone dies. </p>The watch will notify you that the battery is running low by moving the second-hand in 5-second intervals when the battery level is less than 10%, and in 15-second intervals when the battery level is less than 5%.<br/><br/>The watch comes with a charging dock. This has been deliberately designed with a minimalist look, and to be 
small and robust enough to travel with you when you are on the road.<br/><br/><p></p>

</div></div>","THE CALENDAR WATCH by What?
A watch that combines the heritage of watchmaking and one of a kind design with an always visible daily calendar that syncs with the most popular digital calendars, so you can see your day at a glance.




After careful testing and studies, we have come to the conclusion that the best user experience is achieved by making the Calendar Watch as simple as possible by leaving all extra features to our App and online calendars. There are no buttons or unnecessary functions. 
This is a new way to look at time. 



The Calendar Watch allows you to be on top of your game and gives you the ability to better manage your time.
The watch can also save you time because you are not constantly opening calendars for quick checks and it allows you to focus on what you should be doing. It is an efficiency tool to define your work life. Multitasking drops an average man’s IQ by 15 points (source: Stanford).

Nobody likes the guy who is constantly checking his phone at a restaurant, regardless of what’s so important on the screen. Don’t be that guy, yet still know what’s happening in your calendar. On average, a smartphone owner checks their phone 221 times a day (in UK, source: Tecmark) and we think that’s a bit too much.
The battery of the Calendar Watch lasts for weeks and keeps your schedule with you, even when your smartphone dies.

We didn’t want to complicate your life by adding another complicated device, we wanted to help make your life simpler.
Never be late for another meeting. Calendar Watch gives you more freedom from your phone, increases your productivity, and gives you peace of mind.


We have been getting some press attention!Here is a selection of what the media has been saying about us and our new Calendar Watch:



The Calendar Watch is a real and lasting classic timepiece.
The watch is conceived and designed by renowned Japanese art director Masashi Kawamura, who has been featured on the FastCompany’s most creative people list, and Italian industrial designer Umberto Onza, who together have fused the aesthetics and demands of consumers who want to curate their own style with an eye toward story, craftsmanship, and individuality.

With its iconic, refined features, the watch pays tribute to the heritage of watchmaking. It’s polished stainless steel case provides a classic feel, with both comfort and durability, while it’s domed hardened K1 crystal glass is made to last.






You can choose from four models: Polar White, Aqua Blue, Special Edition Black and Verdant Green.The Polar White model has a polished stainless steel body and comes with a brown genuine leather strap with white stitching.


The Aqua Blue model has a matte stainless steel body and comes with a blue suede leather strap.






The Verdant Green model combines green tones with a matt gold effect case, together with pale gold color printed features and hour hand. Complimentary wristbands will also be made available.



The Special Edition Black model has a matte gun-metal black body and comes with a black genuine leather strap with a stylized texture.






The watch features two distinct modes, FIXED and FLEXIBLE, and you can switch between the modes with our accompanying App.
In FLEXIBLE mode the display will be updated segment by segment every 15 minutes, following the hour hand. In this mode, you always see the next 12 hours:


With FIXED mode, the display is completely updated every 12 hours and you can set the starting hour in our App. You can choose what you want the watch to show, for example maybe your work day from 9AM to 9PM, or 7AM to 7PM:
It’s up to you!
Automatic Time Syncing
The analog movements of the watch are synced with the digital components and the App. So the hands are automatically adjusted to the right time - even when you travel to different time zones.

Tapping Input 
By double tapping the watch, it shows your next 12-24h schedule for 5 seconds in both fixed and flexible modes. The watch also vibrates for 0.3 seconds as feedback. After, the display refreshes again and displays your 0-12h schedule.
With a triple tap your schedule is synced immediately with your phone (otherwise the watch automatically syncs every 15 minutes). The watch responds with two 0.3 second vibrations and an animation.
When in airplane mode, a triple tap will wake up the watch and turn on the Bluetooth.
Power Saving
When the watch has not detected any movement for 15 minutes, the watch enters its power-saving mode. This is visualized by the second hand stopping at the 12 o’clock position, while the hour and minute hands will continue to show the time. As soon as motion is detected, the second hand will jump to the correct time.
Notifications
The watch notifies you by vibrating and by flashing the particular event segment according the alert time you have set on your calendar. 
Time accuracy：±15 seconds per month (23℃ ± 5℃, 73F ± 41℃)Operation temperature: 0℃ to +45℃ (32F to 113F)Battery life：~3 weeks Battery: Li-ion (3.7V, 100mAh), 1pc Watch keeps 48h scheduleWaterproof: 5 ATMAssembled in ChinaStainless steel case, Double domed, hardened K1 crystal glass, Modern quick release strap, Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0, E-paper Display, Analog 3-hand movement, Rechargeable battery (with charger).



From the beginning, it was crucial that the watch should not become another device that needed charge daily. Even with continuous syncing with the digital calendar we have been able to make the battery last for weeks, 3 of them we are confident to say! The watch keeps your calendar even when your smartphone dies. The watch will notify you that the battery is running low by moving the second-hand in 5-second intervals when the battery level is less than 10%, and in 15-second intervals when the battery level is less than 5%.The watch comes with a charging dock. This has been deliberately designed with a minimalist look, and to be 
small and robust enough to travel with you when you are on the road.




Our application functions as a tool to manage the settings of your watch, not as a calendar.  All calendar related functions are completed in the digital calendar of your choosing. 





With the App you can:
- See the watch’s battery level- Switch between the Fixed and Flexible modes - Switch between calendars - Set and choose the watch to include several calendars - Set the watch to airplane mode - Set alarms - Put the watch into the power saving mode



Our application and the watch currently sync with the following calendars: iCalendar, Google Calendar, Outlook.com, Facebook Events, Yahoo!, Yandex, and we will be adding more on the way. Any other calendar suggestions are greatly appreciated.



As a unique design feature, we have extended the lugs to travel through the sides of the watch, giving it a very distinctive look.
We have also made them interchangeable, allowing you to swap in differently colored lugs to create a unique timepiece. Changing the lugs with the provided tool is quick, so you can tailor the watch to match your mood or outfit.


Changing the watch face, lugs and wristbands provides a virtually endless possibility of combinations. The lugs can be pre-ordered with your Kickstarter pledge by selecting the options with lugs and/or wristbands, or ordered separately when the product comes to market.


The options for the extra wristbands are for the Unlimited packages.



The options for the extra lug colors for the Limited/Unlimited packages.


The wristbands and lugs can also be bought separately when the product comes to market.
A special tool for changing the lugs comes with the package.







The team has designed and manufactured a similar watch with an E-Paper display and Bluetooth connectivity, that is already on the market. It's called Stop-the-Time Watch. The concept: When life brings you joy that seems too good to be true, Stop-the-Time watch lets you stop the time to mark the moment on the watch face and pair it with a detailed story in the accompanying App. By marking these memorable moments, you create your own unique pattern of moments on the watch face.

Our factory in India makes new design protos at no cost and is full package - they take care of fabric sourcing, dying, cutting, sewing, marking and grading, screen printing the label inside the shirts, as well as the hand embroidery for one cost which makes our margin very transparent as we enter a production cycle.     RISKS AND CHALLENGES  Risks include boutiques ordering product and not being able to pay upon delivery. We have put precautions in place including a factor to insure PO's and credit card deposits from stores our factor does not approve.  Production issues and delays are always a potention. In our contract with the factory we have put into place a protective clause which charges them interest for every day they are late.     OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP!

<h2><strong>Update 2/28: Our dad started his treatments on Monday. So far, so good! It's rough, but he's holding strong. Our mom recently discovered that the insurance company will not be covering the cost of the food for our dad's feeding tube. Our dad's birthday is March 4th. Please consider making a donation or leaving a comment this weekend to show our dad you are thinking of him this weekend on his birthday. Thank you for all of your thoughts, prayers, and generosity! We all appreciate it so very much!</strong></h2>
<h2>*** THANK YOU SO MUCH! I haven't had a chance to update, but thanks to the generosity of all of you, we made our goal in just 10 days! Any money we raise in addition to the $700 will be used towards medical expenses not covered by insurance. You are all wonderful. We are lucky to know you, thank you!***</h2>
<h2>GET OUR DAD TO CHEMO!</h2>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Our names are Doug(29), Jim(25), Kristie(24), and Cody(16). We are so completely blessed to have an amazing father. For three of us, he isn't our biological parent, but for the past 22 years he's been the best dad for which any of us could have ever asked. His name is Steve Harsh. In addition to the four of us kids, our dad also has four lively grandchildren, our mom Dawn his wife of 22 years, and a very loving (pain in the butt) dog named Marvin.</p>
<h3>Why Do We Need You?</h3>
<p>About 6 months ago, our dad started to get sick. At first he thought it was just the flu or a persistent cold. As time went on he did not get better. Two months ago, his doctors found a lump in his throat at the base of his tongue, as well as one in his lymph node. They are cancerous, brought on by the HPV virus. In the coming weeks he starts chemo and radiation treatments. His treatments are 5 days a week for 7 weeks at a facility 2 hours away from his home in Allenstown, New Hampshire. He will also have numerous checkups and appointments.</p>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>As the main earner, being out of work is very stressful for our dad. With all the appointments, our mom and dad are making many trips to and from his doctors in Lebanon, NH. We want to help get our dad to treatments. The money we're trying to raise would be used for gas expenses. Any extra would be used to help offset the medical costs not covered by insurance. We are guessing the cost of gas to be around $700 for around 140 hours of driving total (4 hour round trips, 5 days a week, 7 weeks). Help us give him the peace of mind that this money will bring.</p>
<p>Our dad is only 47 years old. He has a lot more time to spend on this earth and we have a lot more time to spend with him. If you can help in any way, we would be so grateful. Your thoughts, prayers, and well wishes will be incredibly helpful. We understand many do not have the funds to contribute. That's okay! Please just get the word out for us and leave your positive thoughts and energy. Thank you so very much!</p>
<h2>-Doug, Jim, Kristie, and Cody</h2>

<p> ***The funds raised from this are being payed to a paypal account in the name of Steve's son-in-law, Matthew White. He will be managing the account and transferring all funds to Steve and Dawn. Thanks again!***</p></div>","Find us on Facebook:

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>We are BA Honours Textile Design students at Loughborough University, working in the areas of Print, Multimedia and Weave. We are fundraising for our final year show to be held in July 2012.</p>
<p>Whether printed silks for fashion, woven lengths seen for interiors or a textile art multimedia piece, each student has spent the last three years learning and perfecting their skills in order to produce a textile collection of the highest standard. </p>
<p>This London show is a chance for us to showcase our work independently of University and we have worked hard to make it a success. It is so important as it will give us, as students, the opportunity to be viewed not only by the public but by industry professionals. In turn this will aid us in making the difficult transition from education to employment.</p>
<p>We are aiming to raise $1500 which is the equivalent to roughly £900. This will go towards the venue hire, opening night refreshments and entertainment, lighting and other additional costs which contribute to making the exhibition the success we hope it will be.</p>

<p>HOUKIE SKATEBOARD SHOE PROTECTOR</p>
<p>SAVE $$ ON SKATEBOARDING SHOES !! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492688484/dabd41csnylojkhohric.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> Tired of wasting money on new skate shoes?? Problem solved!!</p>
<p>This is a flexible overshoe that will protect all areas where damage occurs when skateboarding.  . The Houkie is stylish, removable and reusable. The actual product will be injection molded rubber and in many different colors.  The initial launch color will be black.  The lightweight HOUKIE only weighs 185 grams!  </p>
<p>The product will not be bulky (approx 1/16th of an inch thick) and will allow the skater to keep the ""board feel"" that is of utmost importance!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492688563/tuztuuwflrkbkbnjqv0l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Skateboarding has progressed from casually riding on a skateboard to stunts, tricks and maneuvering the skateboard in many ways such as kicks, flips, jumps, spins.....etc. This new maneuvering and riding of the skateboard has been known to cause excessive and severe damage to many areas of the rider's shoes due to the surface that the rider is on, and the manipulation of the skateboard with the rider's feet. On the top of the skateboard is ""grip tape"" which is essentially sandpaper. This grip tape, when it comes in comes in contact with the skateboarder's shoe during the tricks and maneuvers, adds traction to the shoe in order for the rider to perform the tricks. This grip tape also causes tearing and major wear to several areas of the shoe. The main areas of the shoe that is affected are the outside upper of the shoe, the laces of the shoe, the ball area of the sole as well as the heel and heel area of the sole. In addition, the soles of the rider's shoe is susceptible to wear from the grip tape and the hard surfaces on which the rider is skating on when his is riding and performing these tricks and stunts, for example: concrete, blacktop, hardwood etc. Within a short time, the skateboarder has worn his shoe down so much that he will need to replace the shoe because it is no longer usable or safe to use. In this day and age, a skate shoe can range in cost from $40 to over $100 per pair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The current products on the market provide some protection of the upper portion of the shoe, but not to the bottom of the shoe. These ""patches"" are affixed to the shoe with adhesive glues or other types of adhesive means.  Another product is a type of glue or rubber cement that is applied to the area of the upper portion of the shoe that dries to form a barrier where the wear is prevalent.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492688664/bzvnk5yurfzblwggrtcw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The current products as stated above are semi-permanent fixes that are mostly not removable from the shoe. These products, such as the adhesive patches, cannot be removed once applied and do not last very long. They do not allow the skateboarder to wear it for any other use than to skateboard since the shoe is altered and not very visually appealing. They do not protect all areas of the shoe where damage and wear is prevalent. The glue/rubber cement product also is not removable once applied. Not only does this product takes time to dry before the rider can wear the shoes to skateboard,  it is made of toxic and harmful chemicals.

These products are not removable nor are they reusable. </p>

<p>The HOUKIE is a removable and reusable flexible overshoe that is placed over the shoe which will cover all areas of the shoe that are damaged during skateboarding. This overshoe is made of a flexible material that conforms to the shoe in all areas needed in order to protect specific portions of the shoe while conforming to the shoe's shape.  The overshoe adds additional cushioning and traction to the heel and ball of the shoe. The middle of the overshoe is constructed in a way to allow the overshoe to be stretched to fit and conform to a very broad range of shoe sizes. The upper and the sole also has added traction in the form of raised areas or other forms of traction to allow the ""grip"" of the shoe to the skateboard for the efficient execution of tricks and stunts.

</div></div>","HOUKIE SKATEBOARD SHOE PROTECTOR
SAVE $$ ON SKATEBOARDING SHOES !! 

 Tired of wasting money on new skate shoes?? Problem solved!!
This is a flexible overshoe that will protect all areas where damage occurs when skateboarding.  . The Houkie is stylish, removable and reusable. The actual product will be injection molded rubber and in many different colors.  The initial launch color will be black.  The lightweight HOUKIE only weighs 185 grams!  
The product will not be bulky (approx 1/16th of an inch thick) and will allow the skater to keep the ""board feel"" that is of utmost importance!

Skateboarding has progressed from casually riding on a skateboard to stunts, tricks and maneuvering the skateboard in many ways such as kicks, flips, jumps, spins.....etc. This new maneuvering and riding of the skateboard has been known to cause excessive and severe damage to many areas of the rider's shoes due to the surface that the rider is on, and the manipulation of the skateboard with the rider's feet. On the top of the skateboard is ""grip tape"" which is essentially sandpaper. This grip tape, when it comes in comes in contact with the skateboarder's shoe during the tricks and maneuvers, adds traction to the shoe in order for the rider to perform the tricks. This grip tape also causes tearing and major wear to several areas of the shoe. The main areas of the shoe that is affected are the outside upper of the shoe, the laces of the shoe, the ball area of the sole as well as the heel and heel area of the sole. In addition, the soles of the rider's shoe is susceptible to wear from the grip tape and the hard surfaces on which the rider is skating on when his is riding and performing these tricks and stunts, for example: concrete, blacktop, hardwood etc. Within a short time, the skateboarder has worn his shoe down so much that he will need to replace the shoe because it is no longer usable or safe to use. In this day and age, a skate shoe can range in cost from $40 to over $100 per pair.
 
The current products on the market provide some protection of the upper portion of the shoe, but not to the bottom of the shoe. These ""patches"" are affixed to the shoe with adhesive glues or other types of adhesive means.  Another product is a type of glue or rubber cement that is applied to the area of the upper portion of the shoe that dries to form a barrier where the wear is prevalent.

The current products as stated above are semi-permanent fixes that are mostly not removable from the shoe. These products, such as the adhesive patches, cannot be removed once applied and do not last very long. They do not allow the skateboarder to wear it for any other use than to skateboard since the shoe is altered and not very visually appealing. They do not protect all areas of the shoe where damage and wear is prevalent. The glue/rubber cement product also is not removable once applied. Not only does this product takes time to dry before the rider can wear the shoes to skateboard,  it is made of toxic and harmful chemicals. Although it can be placed on most areas where the damage is prevalent, It is very messy and does not provide the best protection. It is a very temporary fix to the problem.

While camera holsters are made to transfer payloads to your body and neutralize swings and bounces, we have heard so many horror stories about dropped cameras and lenses. Hence from the get-go, our mission is to create not just a holster of convenience but a comprehensive fail-safe system that is crucial in securing your valuable investment. Featuring a seamless integration of security lock on a single-hand 1-second release, Click will also work in conjunction with your neck strap. This double security approach offers the ultimate in camera safety while providing instant camera access.</p><div>

<h1>TOOLLESS 3-POINT MOUNT WITH TOP-LOADING HOLSTERING</h1>
<p>Click's quick and easy Toolless 3-Point Mounting offers substantial advantages in both functionality and adaptability. When mounted sideways on a belt, the typical 2-point mounted holster or clip is forced into an undesirable side-loading orientation so gravity is working against alignment and safety. In contrast, a 3-Point Mount design enables the Click to retain the preferred top-loading orientation whether it's attached to a horizontal belt (i.e. waist belt or Pro Belt) or a vertical strap (i.e. handbag or backpack).</p>
<h1>SINGLE-HAND 1-SECOND DRAW &amp; NO-LOOK FUNNEL HOLSTERING</h1>
<p>While a security latch may prevent a camera from been accidentally bounced or pushed out of a holster, it also hinders and delays access on conventional camera holsters because you need to first look down to locate and release that security latch with both hands.</p>
<p>With Click, your natural hand position on the camera automatically guides your pinkie finger to the release trigger enabling your right hand - without assistance of your left hand - to deactivate that security and draw the camera with one smooth contiguous motion. </p>
<p> </p>

<h1>INSTANTLY MOUNTS ON TRIPOD</h1>
<p>Once adapted to your camera, the Click’s Arca Swiss-compatible Quick Release Plate (Optional Dual Arca Swiss/RC2 Compatible Quick Release Plate for Manfrotto is also available for purchase) enables you to effortlessly transition between the Click Holster and a tripod without any adapter or plate change. Other compatible holsters sacrifice Arca Swiss’s build-in security catch that prevents your camera from accidentally dislodging from the tripod.</p>

<h1>WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH NECK/SHOULDER STRAP</h1>
<p>Click's open architecture allows you to simultaneously use your holster and your neck/shoulder strap. While Click Holster steadies and transfers the entire payload to your waist, your neck/shoulder strap retains all its original functions and serves as a fail-safe. To accommodate your shoulder strap's larger hooks to Click's Quick Release Plate, you will need the Shoulder Strap Anchor and Tension Balancer (Included with ELITE/ULTIMATE PACKAGES).</p>
<p> </p>

<h1>SAFETY LOCK</h1>
<p>While a locking mechanism may prevent a camera from being accidentally knocked out of the holster, it's also inherently obstructive. In order to streamline camera access without sacrificing security, Click designers developed an exclusive Single-Hand Release mechanism to unlock and draw your camera in one smooth motion.</p>
<h1>FAIL-SAFE STRAP</h1>
<p>In lieu of using your neck/shoulder strap, you can instead choose to hook Click's adjustable Fail-Safe Strap between the Click Holster and its Quick Release Plate (mounted under your camera). If the camera is knocked out of your hand, the strap will catch the camera before it hits the ground.</p>

<h1>WATERPROOF &amp; SUBMERSIBLE</h1>
<p>If you ever need to operate in the rain, underwater or simply in high humidity, we have included this waterproof, submersible and rust-resistant upgrade for all Click Packages. We went through the entire parts list of the Click to make sure it is rust proof. The main body is made of aluminum but due to strength requirement some parts have to be made of stainless steel and they are much more costly to produce than carbon steel used on many conventional holsters.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>To prevent bigger, heavier cameras from bumping against you, a Camera Cushioned Pad can be fitted between your belt and the holster.</p>
<h1>TRAVEL BELT</h1>
<p>Although Click's 3-Point mount is compatible with most waist belts, you can choose between a couple of 2 inch belt options for personalized applications. While our light and robust Travel Belt (Included with PREMIUM / ELITE / ULTIMATE PACKAGES) will easily support an average DSLR camera, we have also designed a Pro Belt for professional and specialized applications.</p>

<p>Professionally integrated with multiple elements, the Pro Belt is structured to comfortably support heavier combination of camera gear for longer duration.

Click with 21 Compelling Functions World's Safest & Fastest Holster with 1 Second Release and Complete Camera Security to Prevent Accidental Drops A seamless execution of form and function with 21 astonishing features and mounting options.SAFETY is the primary reason why most photographers have yet to switch away from dangling heavy cameras on neck/shoulder straps. While camera holsters are made to transfer payloads to your body and neutralize swings and bounces, we have heard so many horror stories about dropped cameras and lenses. Hence from the get-go, our mission is to create not just a holster of convenience but a comprehensive fail-safe system that is crucial in securing your valuable investment. Featuring a seamless integration of security lock on a single-hand 1-second release, Click will also work in conjunction with your neck strap. This double security approach offers the ultimate in camera safety while providing instant camera access.
Click Holster Working in Tandem with Neck Strap 
A modular design for adaptability and expandability, Click features a secured 3-Point mount compatible with a wide variety of belts and shoulder straps. Catering to varying camera gear and events, you can select from 3 quick release plates for adaptability. And build-in funneling can be further enhanced with Expanded Funnel. 
COMPARISON CHART
How does Click stack up against the competition? We took Click and the two top selling camera holsters for an extensive test drive. You will discover there are more than 10 reasons to step up from the conventional holsters to the Click. See comparison chart below.
 
Click Comparison Chart 
For independent testing and review by one of industry's most recognized camera reviewers Michael Andrew, go to www.michaelthemaven.com
 
 
 
Pro Application
 
Click is not only designed for recreational photography, but also for professional applications including weddings. You can carry up to 3 cameras comfortably with the Click setup.
  
MODULAR DESIGN
Keeping it compact with just a Click on a belt or customizing a sophisticated Click setup with a complete line of Click Accessories, you can easily transition from point and shoot to covering professional events. There is an endless selection of mounts and upgrades that targets specific functions or promotes comfort so you can stay focused.
 
Modular Design with Detachable Cushion Pad Mountable to your personal belt 

Click Camera Holster, adaptable to small and large cameras
Tooless Mounting for a wide range of belt/strap width/thickness
Arca Swiss Compatible for easy transition to tripods
Use the Click Holster with your shoulder strap
Integrated Travel/Pro Belts targeting different payloads
Expanded Funnel for no-look 3D holstering of bigger camera/lens
Mount Camera Cushion Pad for comfort and protection
Integrated Fail-Safe Strap to prevent disaster
Multi-Camera Setup for professional shoots

TOOLLESS 3-POINT MOUNT WITH TOP-LOADING HOLSTERING
Click's quick and easy Toolless 3-Point Mounting offers substantial advantages in both functionality and adaptability. When mounted sideways on a belt, the typical 2-point mounted holster or clip is forced into an undesirable side-loading orientation so gravity is working against alignment and safety. In contrast, a 3-Point Mount design enables the Click to retain the preferred top-loading orientation whether it's attached to a horizontal belt (i.e. waist belt or Pro Belt) or a vertical strap (i.e. handbag or backpack).
SINGLE-HAND 1-SECOND DRAW & NO-LOOK FUNNEL HOLSTERING
While a security latch may prevent a camera from been accidentally bounced or pushed out of a holster, it also hinders and delays access on conventional camera holsters because you need to first look down to locate and release that security latch with both hands.
With Click, your natural hand position on the camera automatically guides your pinkie finger to the release trigger enabling your right hand - without assistance of your left hand - to deactivate that security and draw the camera with one smooth contiguous motion. 
 
Single Hand Release Trigger 
BUILT-IN FUNNEL
Click's Built-in Funnel (All Click Packages) easily guides your camera into the holster. 
 
Build-In Funnel for Easy Holstering 
EXPANDED FUNNEL FOR NO-LOOK 3D HOLSTERING
You can choose to further expand funneling by attaching the optional Expanded Funnel (Included with PREMIUM/ELITE/ULTIMATE PACKAGES) which facilitates faster guided no-look 3D holstering of cameras, especially in low light or indoor shoots.

EXPANDED FUNNEL 
NO BELT NEEDED 
Click can work without a belt. The middle clamp locks into to the thicker seam at the top of your pants and prevents it from dislodging. It's a secure design suited to either men or women.
 
Click Works Without a Belt 
ANTI-SWING & ANTI-BOUNCE
Click's guided tracks represent a crucial improvement over conventional steel pin holsters. Once funneled and secured into Click's holstered position, a camera, even with long lenses, won't swing and bounce as you walk.  
INSTANTLY MOUNTS ON TRIPOD
Once adapted to your camera, the Click’s Arca Swiss-compatible Quick Release Plate (Optional Dual Arca Swiss/RC2 Compatible Quick Release Plate for Manfrotto is also available for purchase) enables you to effortlessly transition between the Click Holster and a tripod without any adapter or plate change. Other compatible holsters sacrifice Arca Swiss’s build-in security catch that prevents your camera from accidentally dislodging from the tripod.
 
Click comes with Security Catch for tripod. 
Each Click holster that we ship is paired with a Pro Quick Release Plate. For additional Quick Release Plates please see Click Accessories below.
 
3 TYPES OF QUICK RELEASE PLATES 
Turbo Ace offers unprecedented versatility when it comes to instant tripod mounting. There are 3 types of mounting plates that works with the Click holster.

Pro Quick Release Plate is Arca Swiss compatible and its tapered edge provides easy NO-LOOK funneling for both large and small cameras. (Included with DELUXE/PREMIUM/ELITE/ULTIMATE PACKAGES)
Lite Quick Release Plate is light and unobstrusive, a more practical fit for your smaller DSLR camera. (Can be purchased separately as an option.)
Dual Quick Release Plate for photographer who uses both the Manfrotto RC2 and the Arca Swiss quick release system. (Can be purchased separately as an option.)

 
Convert any Quick Release Plate to Arca Swiss for Click 
INVERTIBLE FOR LENS CHANGE
Click's smart invertible feature can easily transform into a Lens Changing Station . Simply holster the camera face up and the camera is lock and secured for lens change.
 
Click Instantly Transforms to a Lens Changing Station 
WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH NECK/SHOULDER STRAP
Click's open architecture allows you to simultaneously use your holster and your neck/shoulder strap. While Click Holster steadies and transfers the entire payload to your waist, your neck/shoulder strap retains all its original functions and serves as a fail-safe. To accommodate your shoulder strap's larger hooks to Click's Quick Release Plate, you will need the Shoulder Strap Anchor and Tension Balancer (Included with ELITE/ULTIMATE PACKAGES).
 
Works in Conjunction with Shoulder Strap 
SAFETY LOCK
While a locking mechanism may prevent a camera from being accidentally knocked out of the holster, it's also inherently obstructive. In order to streamline camera access without sacrificing security, Click designers developed an exclusive Single-Hand Release mechanism to unlock and draw your camera in one smooth motion.
FAIL-SAFE STRAP
In lieu of using your neck/shoulder strap, you can instead choose to hook Click's adjustable Fail-Safe Strap between the Click Holster and its Quick Release Plate (mounted under your camera). If the camera is knocked out of your hand, the strap will catch the camera before it hits the ground.
 
Fall Safe Strap

<p>Martenero’s latest release is the Edgemere Reserve. A new version of our original Edgemere model, it’s a nautical-themed watch inspired by the marine chronometer.</p>
<p>It’s the seventh design that we have released, and we think it’s our best yet. With so many watches to choose from, it was important that we came up with a design that was truly original. And we think we did it - this is something you can take anywhere and know that you’re wearing something truly unique. You don’t have to look like everyone else, you can have your own original look when wearing this watch. </p>

<p> The Edgemere Reserve is also our most detailed watch yet with complications including a power reserve, 24-hour time subdial, and date window. This is the type of design and details that are more commonly found on watches costing thousands of dollars, and we’re happy to be able to offer this at a fraction of that cost.</p>

<p>The design of the watch is loosely based on a marine chronometer, but we took it in a pretty unique direction. At the heart of the design is the dial. An elevated hour ring stands out against the base of the dial, and for each colorway the hour ring contrasts noticeably with both the interior and outer ring. This adds a lot of complexity and nuance to the design, and helps give it such an original look. We then added very distinctive colors to each dial in order to better highlight certain design features. Every piece of the dial design is unique to Martenero. </p>

<p>We then made sure that all of the hands are all balanced and work in harmony together. Since there are five hands in total (hour, minute, second, power reserve, 24-hour time), it was important to get this detail right as any inconsistency would throw the design out of balance.</p>
<p>We decided to size this at 40 mm, which we think is the perfect size for this watch. It’s noticeable but not overpowering on the wrist, and it nicely fits a wide range of wrist sizes.</p>

<p>While the design of the Edgemere Reserve is clean, the construction behind it is surprisingly complex. The case is made of stainless steel, and it’s an original design with both brushed and polished finishing. The crystal is a double-domed sapphire crystal with anti-reflective coating, which means that it won’t get scratched and there won’t be any reflection or glare when you’re checking the time. On the back of the case, there’s a sapphire crystal that shows the movement inside. In reference to the original design inspiration of the marine chronometer, there’s a nautical compass etched into the crystal. All of these elements come together to make a unique, well-designed and well-built case..</p>

<p>The dial has three layers between the base, hour ring, and applied numerals. This creates a visual stacking effect on the dial which is not seen on most watches.

</div>","Founded in 2014, Martenero is a premium watch brand offering original, contemporary designs at accessible price points. Our aesthetic revolves around creating unique designs that stem from the classics. With a strong respect for the heritage brands that have come before us, we're driven to make our watches new classics in their own right. We call it ‘Tradition Refreshed’. 




















Martenero’s latest release is the Edgemere Reserve. A new version of our original Edgemere model, it’s a nautical-themed watch inspired by the marine chronometer.
It’s the seventh design that we have released, and we think it’s our best yet. With so many watches to choose from, it was important that we came up with a design that was truly original. And we think we did it - this is something you can take anywhere and know that you’re wearing something truly unique. You don’t have to look like everyone else, you can have your own original look when wearing this watch. 





 The Edgemere Reserve is also our most detailed watch yet with complications including a power reserve, 24-hour time subdial, and date window. This is the type of design and details that are more commonly found on watches costing thousands of dollars, and we’re happy to be able to offer this at a fraction of that cost.










The design of the watch is loosely based on a marine chronometer, but we took it in a pretty unique direction. At the heart of the design is the dial. An elevated hour ring stands out against the base of the dial, and for each colorway the hour ring contrasts noticeably with both the interior and outer ring. This adds a lot of complexity and nuance to the design, and helps give it such an original look. We then added very distinctive colors to each dial in order to better highlight certain design features. Every piece of the dial design is unique to Martenero. 





We then made sure that all of the hands are all balanced and work in harmony together. Since there are five hands in total (hour, minute, second, power reserve, 24-hour time), it was important to get this detail right as any inconsistency would throw the design out of balance.
We decided to size this at 40 mm, which we think is the perfect size for this watch. It’s noticeable but not overpowering on the wrist, and it nicely fits a wide range of wrist sizes.





 There are five different available colorways for the Edgemere, and they’re all completely different. While it’s one design, the five different options feel like totally different watches. There’s white if you’re looking for something understated; blue or dark blue if you want something sporty; silver for something a little more dressy; or black if you prefer a look that’s a little more stark. 





BLUE
Our flagship version of the Edgemere Reserve, this is the most colorful and eye-catching version of them all. The multi-colored dial stands out on the wrist, but still maintains its balance through the carefully selected colors. 





WHITE
Our most restrained version, the white dial is perfect for those who prefer something a little more understated on their wrist. Despite its low-key design, the blue and red accents give the watch a very unique look.  





SILVER
The dressiest version of them all. Bursts of silver and light blue give the watch a dressy touch that makes it perfect for any occasion.





DARK BLUE
The deep blue color on this dial is for those who want something sporty yet versatile. Touches of red break up the otherwise all blue aesthetic.





BLACK
In contrast to our more colorful options, the black version is for those who prefer to wear something a little more stark. Touches of blue and mint add character to the otherwise subdued looking watch.










 All of the watch’s complications come together to add extra dimensions to the watch, and they also influence the aesthetics and help give it such a unique and balanced look.
POWER RESERVE
The watch has a 40-hour power reserve, and through the index at the top of the watch you can always see exactly how much of a charge you have built up. The hand will be pointed to the right at a full charge, straight down when it’s halfway charged, and to the left when the charge is running low. 





24 HOUR TIME
This is a subdial (dial within a dial) that sits at the 6 o’clock position. It doesn’t ever need to be adjusted, and gives a representation of the time in a 24 hours context.





DATE WINDOW
A clean, framed date window sits at the 3 o’clock position, not only displaying the date but also helping to balance the dial design.










While the design of the Edgemere Reserve is clean, the construction behind it is surprisingly complex. The case is made of stainless steel, and it’s an original design with both brushed and polished finishing. The crystal is a double-domed sapphire crystal with anti-reflective coating, which means that it won’t get scratched and there won’t be any reflection or glare when you’re checking the time.

It’s a very complicated construction that brings out the details in this design. 










 The Edgemere Reserve is powered by a Miyota 9132 movement that registers at 28,800 beats per hour. This is a very high-quality Japanese movement used by premium watch brands, and it's similar in accuracy to much more expensive Swiss movements.
One feature of the movement is that it’s automatic, so it will wind itself naturally as you wear it. It's also hacking, meaning that the second hand stops when you set the time, allowing for more accurate time setting. And with a power reserve of 40 hours, this is watch you can set aside for a while and it will continue to tick.

<h3>Our Story &amp; Our Mission</h3>
<p>We are a team of volunteers that started <a href=""https://www.HopeOutfitters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hope Outfitters</a> back in 2012. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538878021/ht12wcwol9dskluvgf5f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have poured everything into this company, not taking a penny of the profit along the way.  Since we started our clothing brand we have given back over $220,000 to the causes we have partnered with.  We started it because Jesus gave up everything to love us and we, in a small way, want to do the same.  So here's how it works: we design and sell apparel and give all of the profits away.  Every year we partner with a new charity, work to create awareness for it and donate 100% of the profits from the sale of our clothing back to its cause.  </p>
<p>It may seem small to buy a T-shirt, but it matters.  Mother Teresa said, ""...Do small things with great love.""   When all of us work together, our small acts can add up to make a big difference.  From the sale of our T-shirts we have healed the sick, sheltered the homeless, rescued girls out of human trafficking, provided clean water, granted money to adopting families, and so much more...all because of your purchases.  Together we are changing our world for Christ.  Together we are making a difference that will last for all eternity.</p>
<h3>Our Campaign (What We Need)</h3>
<p>We have exciting news to share--we have decided to open up a new store in downtown Spokane, WA at River Park Square Mall.  We know it's time to take that next big step of faith to expand our mission and message. </p>
<ul></ul>
<p>So here's where you come in!  God's been faithful to grow our company in the last 5 years, debt free!  Because He has used people like you to help us every step of the way.  When you invest in this project it will go toward three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remodeling the existing store (see video for pictures).  This is a huge job: new electrical, drywall, paint, signage, and furniture; cost is $45,000 (We'll try to do as much of the work ourselves to keep the cost down as much as possible.)</li>
<li>Designing, developing and manufacturing our new fall clothing line to include tees, hats, dresses, and pants; cost is $55,000.</li>
<li>All new inventory to fill up the new shop; cost is $60,000.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Total Investment Needed: $150,000</strong></p>
<p>Here is a pic of the store that needs remodeling work:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538876968/asda2gakabxcbm0bj1ij.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We are so grateful for anything you can give, but every person who gives over $100 will receive a $40 gift card.  This will allow you to buy any sweatshirt, T-shirt, or hat of your choice.  (The gift card will be sent to your email by March 2019.) To see our clothing <a href=""https://www.HopeOutfitters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This new store and new line of clothing is important for 3 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we'll be able to sell more gear which means we can give back more money to the causes we partner with.</li>
<li>Second, we'll be able to spread the light and love of Jesus through downtown Spokane.</li>
<li>Third, this is our first big step of faith and it will be a model for opening stores all over America.</li>
</ul>
<p>We completely remodeled an older building for our first shop a few years ago and did most of the work ourselves.  It took an entire summer to finish but since then it has been a source of light and hope in our community.  Here is a picture of our existing store in Richland, WA:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538872659/dtjxzkfioexavzi25alq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

It may seem small to buy a T-shirt, but it matters.  Mother Teresa said, ""...Do small things with great love.""   When all of us work together, our small acts can add up to make a big difference.  From the sale of our T-shirts we have healed the sick, sheltered the homeless, rescued girls out of human trafficking, provided clean water, granted money to adopting families, and so much more...all because of your purchases.  Together we are changing our world for Christ.  Together we are making a difference that will last for all eternity.
Our Campaign (What We Need)
We have exciting news to share--we have decided to open up a new store in downtown Spokane, WA at River Park Square Mall.  We know it's time to take that next big step of faith to expand our mission and message. 

So here's where you come in!  God's been faithful to grow our company in the last 5 years, debt free!  Because He has used people like you to help us every step of the way.  When you invest in this project it will go toward three things:

Remodeling the existing store (see video for pictures).  This is a huge job: new electrical, drywall, paint, signage, and furniture; cost is $45,000 (We'll try to do as much of the work ourselves to keep the cost down as much as possible.)
Designing, developing and manufacturing our new fall clothing line to include tees, hats, dresses, and pants; cost is $55,000.
All new inventory to fill up the new shop; cost is $60,000.

Total Investment Needed: $150,000
Here is a pic of the store that needs remodeling work:


What You Get
We are so grateful for anything you can give, but every person who gives over $100 will receive a $40 gift card.  This will allow you to buy any sweatshirt, T-shirt, or hat of your choice.  (The gift card will be sent to your email by March 2019.) To see our clothing click here.

The Impact
This new store and new line of clothing is important for 3 reasons:

First, we'll be able to sell more gear which means we can give back more money to the causes we partner with.
Second, we'll be able to spread the light and love of Jesus through downtown Spokane.
Third, this is our first big step of faith and it will be a model for opening stores all over America.

We completely remodeled an older building for our first shop a few years ago and did most of the work ourselves.  It took an entire summer to finish but since then it has been a source of light and hope in our community.  Here is a picture of our existing store in Richland, WA:

<br/><p>Purobu will work <strong>anywhere in the world</strong>, so please pre-order, wherever you are.</p>
<p>The free cellular data will work in <b>40 countries</b> (<a href=""#map"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View Map</a>). If you are not in one of these countries, you can still use Purobu with your own SIM card (or WiFi).</p>

<br/><h3>Introducing Purobu</h3>
<p>Purobu is a tiny, lightweight device with a number of integrated sensors providing real-time information to the Purobu Cloud via Cellular/WiFi. This is then made available to the owner via a web-based control panel or an API.</p>
<p>The Purobu Probe has <b>infinite uses</b>. Some users may decide to use the probe to track their property or family in real-time (with no technical skills required) from anywhere in the world, via the website. On the other hand, developers may wish to create their own applications using the <b>powerful API</b>.</p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/838540/files/20140906092024-infotypes.png?1410020424"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>The Purobu Probe</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/824901/files/20140831145050-device-size.png?1409521850"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Made of anodized aluminum and measuring 2in x 2in (5cm x 5cm), 0.4in (1cm) thin, and weighing only 1.8oz (50g), the device is small and light enough to be placed just about anywhere. It has a built-in lithium polymer battery, which will run up to a week (approx. 24 hours of continuous, real-time tracking).</p>
<p>You can also extend the battery life considerably by choosing to receive updates at intervals rather than in real-time. The device can also be powered by Micro USB.</p>
<p>Maintaining a continuous connection to the Purobu Cloud is essential to creating a real-time experience; as such the device has multiple connection methods available including <b>WiFi and Cellular</b>, with automatic roaming between the two.</p>
<p>Purobu uses the very latest ultra sensitive wireless technologies to ensure that a connection is possible in almost <b>any environment</b>.</p>
<p>The advanced <b>integrated antenna</b> design allows Purobu to continue working in a pocket, a bag, inside a glove compartment, or even inside a multi-story building.</p>

<br/><h3>The Purobu Cloud</h3>
<p>The Purobu Cloud provides you with <b>live</b> access to location and sensor information via a web-based control panel, as well as a powerful developers' API.</p>
<br/><h3>Purobu Control Panel</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826414/files/20140901091601-panelshots.png?1409588161"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have developed the control panel to be as intuitive and app-like as possible.</p>
<p>We have created a control panel that displays live information without needing to refresh; this includes showing the device's current location via a <b>moving marker on a map</b>, as well as device stats, such as signal strength and battery status.</p>
<p>You can also add and remove widgets that display sensor data.</p>
<br/><h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p>We take security and privacy very seriously, and fully understand how sensitive your location and sensor information can be. By default, we don't store your information on our servers for any longer than it takes for you to access it via the control panel or API. Once you have viewed the latest data, it is then <b>disregarded</b>.</p>
<p>If you are happy for us to store your data (using industry-standard encryption), you will be able to enable a feature, (<b>disabled by default</b>), which will provide you with extra functionality, such as being able to view <b>historical information</b>.</p>
<br/><h3>Purobu Cloud API</h3>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826497/files/20140901094822-apishot.png?1409590102"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Introducing Purobu
Purobu is a tiny, lightweight device with a number of integrated sensors providing real-time information to the Purobu Cloud via Cellular/WiFi. This is then made available to the owner via a web-based control panel or an API.
The Purobu Probe has infinite uses. Some users may decide to use the probe to track their property or family in real-time (with no technical skills required) from anywhere in the world, via the website. On the other hand, developers may wish to create their own applications using the powerful API.

The Purobu Probe

Made of anodized aluminum and measuring 2in x 2in (5cm x 5cm), 0.4in (1cm) thin, and weighing only 1.8oz (50g), the device is small and light enough to be placed just about anywhere. It has a built-in lithium polymer battery, which will run up to a week (approx. 24 hours of continuous, real-time tracking).
You can also extend the battery life considerably by choosing to receive updates at intervals rather than in real-time. The device can also be powered by Micro USB.
Maintaining a continuous connection to the Purobu Cloud is essential to creating a real-time experience; as such the device has multiple connection methods available including WiFi and Cellular, with automatic roaming between the two.
Purobu uses the very latest ultra sensitive wireless technologies to ensure that a connection is possible in almost any environment.
The advanced integrated antenna design allows Purobu to continue working in a pocket, a bag, inside a glove compartment, or even inside a multi-story building.

The Purobu Cloud
The Purobu Cloud provides you with live access to location and sensor information via a web-based control panel, as well as a powerful developers' API.
Purobu Control Panel

We have developed the control panel to be as intuitive and app-like as possible.
We have created a control panel that displays live information without needing to refresh; this includes showing the device's current location via a moving marker on a map, as well as device stats, such as signal strength and battery status.
You can also add and remove widgets that display sensor data.
Security & Privacy
We take security and privacy very seriously, and fully understand how sensitive your location and sensor information can be. By default, we don't store your information on our servers for any longer than it takes for you to access it via the control panel or API. Once you have viewed the latest data, it is then disregarded.
If you are happy for us to store your data (using industry-standard encryption), you will be able to enable a feature, (disabled by default), which will provide you with extra functionality, such as being able to view historical information.
Purobu Cloud API

The Rest API is incredibly powerful and enables you to build your own apps using sensor data from the device. Our goal is to ensure that new sensor information is available in the API within 100ms. This low level of latency will allow you to create the kind of apps that would usually require a local sensor.
We will be providing libraries in various programming languages, including PHP, Ruby, Java, .NET, Python and Node to make integration even simpler.

<p>My name is Hila and I`m from Tel Aviv, Israel.</p>
<p>I first started my infatuation with the body at the age of 7 when I enrolled to Ballet class for the first time. </p>
<p>Since the age of 7 and up to this point I explored the body and its many aspects.  This through dance, Pilates, anatomy, Auyrveda, massages etc.</p>
<p>Today  I`m exploring the body from a new angle, while becoming a fashion designer. </p>
<p>Due to my mother`s brave struggle with breast cancer and the process that she has gone through I decided to produce a clothing collection that gives an answer to most of the needs that arise while struggling with the disease.</p>
<p>But first, I have to study fashion design in order to make it right.</p>
<p>Recently I got accepted to the IED, one of the leading academies for design studies in Europe. Sadly I cannot pay the tuition fee, and this is where I need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All the funding from this campaign will cover the tuition fee and basic cost of living.</p>
<p>Of course I won’t rely just on your generous contribution. I will work as much as possible, but more excess time means more space for me to work on my final goal- creating a special collection for breast cancer fighters.</p>
<p><strong>As a ballet dancer I’ve learned that devotion is above all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I won`t rest until I`ll reach my goal. This project is my mission in life.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In order to continue the circle of donation I will contribute 5% from the total income to the NBCF. </em></strong></p>
<p>Also, I will give a one-piece item specially designed by me to show my sincere gratitude for your contribution.</p>
<p>The final goal, after I graduate, will be to produce a clothing line for women who fight breast cancer.</p>
<p>The long and hard process of healing includes many limitations and many needs that should be considered.</p>
<p>For example, the intolerance of the skin to sun due to chemotherapy and radiation, the sensitivity of the skin to synthetic fabrics, the loss of privacy due to medical exams, but most importantly, the feeling that their femininity was taken away from them.</p>
<p>Another important aspect that people tend to forget is what happens to these women after recovering from the disease.</p>
<p>Most of these women quit their jobs and invest all of their lives in fighting, in surviving.</p>
<p>After recovering they often find themselves without a working place and without direction in life.</p>
<p>As such, my vision is to allow these women to find their place back in society, by creating more job positions for them such as dressmaking, marketing, advertising and all that is necessary in order to produce the clothing line, and in doing so, to bring them back to a creative and productive path while helping other women who are dealing with the disease.</p>
<p><strong>I believe in fare trade</strong>, in fair employment terms, in high quality of every product and reasonable prices since it may occur to any woman at any stage in her life.</p>
<p>Recently I have started to work at the offices of curediva.com, an internet site that will launch very soon. This site provides support for women who fight breast cancer from the moment they receive a diagnosis and all the way through the healing process. </p>
<p>This is where I was first exposed to how the whole process is important for them also this is where I first heard of the necessity for proper clothing and occupation after recovering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will appreciate every donation you can give me, but if u can’t – It’s ok.</p>

</p><p>Women are known to consider heel shoes to be more
important than a simple accessory. Wearing heel shoes all day long involves
compromises. In the past, new technologies have revolutionized sports shoes by
considerably increasing their efficiency but one question remains: what about
heel shoes? As a sophisticated woman, you juggle with many hats in your
everyday life and we believe <b>you
expect more from your shoes</b>.</p>
<p>Our team carried out extensive research to design <b>a removable heel shoe</b>. Alegory
now allows you to <b>change the style of your shoes to suit your mood and your
needs</b> by switching <b>the
height, color and design of the heel at any time.</b></p>

<p>In case you hesitate between two sizes, or if you
have a skinny foot, we would recommend you to choose the smaller size. In

<p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Women are known to consider heel shoes to be more
important than a simple accessory. Wearing heel shoes all day long involves
compromises. In the past, new technologies have revolutionized sports shoes by
considerably increasing their efficiency but one question remains: what about
heel shoes? As a sophisticated woman, you juggle with many hats in your
everyday life and we believe you
expect more from your shoes.
Our team carried out extensive research to design a removable heel shoe. Alegory
now allows you to change the style of your shoes to suit your mood and your
needs by switching the
height, color and design of the heel at any time.
Quality is one of the main concerns of our company. From the choice
of raw materials to manufacturing, Alegory develops all its processes around
the absoluterequirement of
quality.
We select our leather in the best Italian tannery and
are very proud of our eighty-year-old traditional French factory. Our shoes
received the “Made in France” label, as a reward for their high quality. Auréa and Jessica are high-quality finished heels: one
cut pump with 5 stiches per centimeter and a leather sole with an injected
rubber pad.To give you a taste of things to come ...
We would like to thank you and the community of
fans for allowing us to succeed
in the footwear industry.
By bringing this project to IndieGoGo and directly to you, we can cut distributors and retailers, as well as additional marketing expenses.

点名时间上中文說明: http://dwz.cn/navspark_demohourWHAT IS IT?
NavSpark is a small, powerful, breadboard-friendly, 32bit development board that is Arduino compatible, with a world class GPS receiver as on-board peripheral, and under $15. There is also NavSpark-BD, a variant model having world-class GPS/Beidou receiver as on-board peripheral, that enables you to adopt new GPS/Beidou satellite navigation technology when Broadcom Qualcomm just recently came out with solution supporting Beidou to their tier-1 smartphone customers like Apple and Samsung.NavSpark puts leading edge satellite navigation technology in the hands of the makers....Up until now, adding GPS to an
Arduino requires additional GPS shield, which adds cost and size. NavSpark has GPS
built-in, so there is no need for an additional GPS shield. And it's cheap enough
to leave in any project.
This little NavSpark board packs big features: 100MHz 32bit
RISC/FPU, 1024KByte Flash, 212KByte RAM, high-performance GPS, many peripherals and I/O pins. With 32bit processing power,
number crunching capability, and very large memory, NavSpark takes your projects
to a whole new level. THE
STORY
We have been developing GPS related products for some years. The GPS chipset nowadays are quite powerful. Seeing many small development boards on
the market with limited memory space and low computation power, we believe a small low-cost 32bit development board using our new more powerful Venus 8 chip, integrating GPS library into Arduino IDE, offering at near 8-bitter price and with GPS functionality, may serve as an useful and attractive building block for
the maker community. The Venus 8 chip is built with enough MIPS and memory to process signal from combination of 34 GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, and Galileo satellites in parallel simultaneously. It is the reason why it has more memory and computation MIPS than most popular low-cost embedded microcontrollers on the market.Unsure if there will actually be sufficient interest in small low-cost development board built from powerful satellite positioning processor chip (like GPU used in non-graphic applications), this Indiegogo campaign is our approach to find out. If you like the idea and find it could be useful for your applications, please support this campaign to let us know. With sufficient interest, NavSpark will go into production and be made available.  The NavSpark is essentially an easy to use, breadboard-friendly version of our Venus838FLPx GPS module with GPS library SDK integrated into customized Arduino IDE.ARDUINO
COMPATIBLE
NavSpark is designed to run Wiring,
the same simple code as the Arduino platform. There is no need to learn any new
programming language or environment. Your standard Arduino sketches run on NavSpark.

seals; published in March/April 2012 edition.
NavSpark uses latest generation low power 55nm
Venus 822 chip; could design into more complex devices such as fitness GPS watch
like applications.
NavSpark provides accurate
position, velocity, and time for applications in need of this information. Even if used without GPS,
NavSpark’s 100MHz RISC/FPU + 1MByte Flash + 212Kbyte RAM + UART + SPI + I2C +
GPIO hardware has less restrictive use than a typical 8bit development board.DEVELOPMENT
TIMELINEHARDWARE
DEVELOPMENTS
NavSpark is a shrink down version of the bigger Venus 822 development board. With Venus 822 board already working, the design of NavSpark hardware is rather straight forward.
SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENTS
We are currently customizing the Arduino
IDE to work with the Sparc-V8 compiler and Venus 822 hardware; it is expected to be finished before end
of January, 2014.
MANUFACTURING
If the NavSpark funding campaign is
successful, we will:
Place order for BOM to
manufacture NavSpark on Feb 7, 2014
Send BOM to factory for production, March 17, 2014
Ship out NavSpark, March 27, 2014PROJECT
HISTORY (Updated When New Application Developments Available)
The 55nm Venus 8 returned in May of 2013. It has been packaged into small 5mm x 5mm QFN40 package, with very limited I/O, for standard global navigation satellite positioning module applications. The 7mm x 7mm QF56 packaged Venus 822 has more I/O pins, suitable for small global navigation satellite positioning application development. The earlier model of Venus 822 development
board for internal use is much larger in size as shown below:For NavSpark, optimizing the circuitry and moving some components to the back-side, we reduce the size to 38mm x 18mm. Below is the 1st hand-made NavSpark prototype:

NS-RAW is to be used as it is without Arduino programability, due to some technical issue yet to overcome and we prefer not to over-promise. You’ll receive 2 NS-RAW and 2 active antenna* at Indiegogo promotional price.USD$220   NS-Sparc 21pcs Set
(FedEx Shipping included, no Antenna)
Several people asking if we could
provide very low cost development board no more than $10, simply for using Venus822's powerful 100MHz 32bit RISC/FPU + 1MByte Flash + 212KByte RAM + other peripherals
resources without using GPS/GNSS. The NS-Sparc is our answer. You’ll receive 21 NS-Sparc
at Indiegogo promotional price, FedEx shipping is included. We’ll combine all your
other perks and ship together along with this one. If you already chosen $20 FedEx perk previously, drop us a private comment letting us know which of the NavSpark, NavSpark-GL, or NavSpark-BD 1pcs Set Perk you like to swap. Below is a handmade prototype showing what NS-Spark will look like without GPS/GNSS. All I/O functions in NavSpark remains the same, just lack of 1PPS function that needs GPS/GNSS.Note *: The active antenna receives GPS / GLONASS / Beidou signals. 1”x1” ceramic patch internal active antenna, 10cm length, U.FL connector. Note **: Yes! NavSpark-GL and Nav-Spark-BD are for those of you wondering ""My iPhone and Galaxy phone has GPS/GLONASS. Why isn't there GPS/GLONASS for my Arduino projects?""  NavSpark-BD allows you to jump ahead of your iPhone and Galaxy phone and early adopt GPS/Beidou technology!SHIPPINGAll perks has airmail postal shipping fee included, to be shipped from Taiwan. Postal shipping is not trackable. Please additionally choose the $20 FedEx shipping perk if you want your selected perk to be trackable.RISK and CHALLENGESWe at SkyTraq have years of experience bringing GPS/GNSS
chipset and module products to the market, shipped over 7 million pieces to-date
globally. We have working prototype of NavSpark, so there should be little
chance for surprises later on. That being said, no contract manufacturing could
be guaranteed without hiccups or delay beforehand. It could due to other sudden large
order shortening originally planned capacity, or delay in receiving ordered materials,
and so on. We have sufficient experience to reduce such risk to minimum. If
there is a delay that will shift our shipping timeline, we will update you. We'll
bend over backwards to get NavSpark to you.UPDATES 1. Following current trend and suggestion from our supporter, micro USB connector will be used in NavSpark shipment.2. If Indiegogo's funders count for the NavSpark campaign surpass 4000 backers, we’ll provide 2 antennas for each NavSpark board instead of 1, as bonus for all. Excessive plug/unplug of the antenna may wear out the U.FL female connector on the antenna side, a 2nd antenna at hand will come in handy.3. From numerous requests for an micro SD card holder, the concept of an Adapter Board for NavSpark is born. The Adapter Board will have micro SD card holder + through holes for battery connection + Li-Ion battery charger IC, as below link shows. 2 Adapter boards with 2 battery connector cable is provided as $12 perk, postal shipping included. April 10 for combined perk shipment if this perk is picked, due to 5 kinds of boards we need to prepare; we will try to meet March 27 delivery if possible.http://t.cn/8FVyxQ3     Select this Adapter Board perk only if you gotten a NavSpark, NavSpark-GL, or NavSpark-BD; otherwise you have no need for this Adapter Board.4. GPS is designed to work outdoors and can take
longer time to get position fix in signal attenuated indoor environment, and might not be able to get position fix if signal becomes too weak. Due to some backers
asking if we can provide active antenna with longer cable, making it possible to
do GPS testing at some distance from the window (with antenna placed by the window
of course) we added an extra $15 perk consisting of (external GPS/GLONASS/Beidou active antenna with 2.5 meter cable and SMA connector) + (15cm SMA-to-U.FL connector cable). SMA-to-U.FL connector cable example: http://goo.gl/VAKrwGinternal active antenna example: http://goo.gl/4Iwhhtexternal active antenna example: http://goo.gl/O0qbueNavSpark drawing Mandelbrot figure in 48x84 pixel resolution: each point computed and drawn, after completion pause for a while, clear entire screen, pause for a while, then repeat. As the figure appear almost instantly, computation with an FPU is quite fast.COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS (click to view PDF file)The above PDF contains aggregate of useful Questions & Answers which came up in the Comment page, which might recur, with newest on the top for easier reading by those who occasionally wish to keep track of the discussions on NavSpark.John Beale, a very supportive backer with no affiliation to NavSpark nor SkyTraq, is very kind to make a compilation of the discussed items into a more structured FAQ to assist later supporters or visitors to the page. This structured FAQ will be easier for first time reading: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=1f5iXwiT   Thanks John, much appreciated !",12.0,1,"1 Campaign

Whether the campaign is fully funded or not, you wonderful people will still get your sweet shirts! If you backed the Kickstarter, feel free to pledge again! I assure you, you will get your product this time!Every penny raised will go towards moving TEEvil Genius away from Print On Demand services. What does this mean for my customers? Cheaper shirts, faster printing, and faster shipping! It's win-win for everybody! This also allows me to personally handle each and every order, and maybe even throw in some sweet extras. Who doesn't like sweet extras?!Any extra funding I receive through Indiegogo will result in extra rewards, lower reward costs and funding my money-powered solar death ray. So please, if you enjoy nerdy things, like Tee Shirts, previously backed the Kickstarter, or just want to help your fellow man, think about sharing, commenting, or pledging! Every little bit helps! Thanks!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

It's never too late to start the journey, set the standard, and lead the way. Introducing our Bold Rhium Snapback! -Green Underbill -8 Rows Stitches -Quality Firm Flat Bill Hat -MORE TO COME!!!                                      -T-SHIRTS-Our T-Shirts are made out of fabric containing, polyester, cotton, and spandex, to provide a blend that will feel and look great!  We have teamed up with skilled manufacturers to bring you apparel, primarily focused on:Fit - Fitted to provide an adequate length for all ranges of motion. Fabric - Latest in performance fabrics that are breathable, and moisture-controlled. Color - Keeps the life of its color, even throughout washes.Performance - Durable for training, as well as for everyday wear.     
We plan to produce these threads locally so that we can closely oversee each process, in addition to supporting other local businesses. However, in order to make that happen, our goal is to raise at least $5,000 to cover manufacturing expenses. These expenses include things like:

fabric
pattern making
cut and sew
and printing.









We're looking for your help to launch our first array of clothing. Anything above our goal will go towards building and expanding our brand, including a women's line.                Every contribution will bring us one step closer into full-production. We appreciate every contribution!We expect hurdles along the way, but we believe they will be limited as we reach our pledged goal.

If you'd like to support Rhium in more ways than a donation, help us spread the word! Share our campaign with your family and friends through word-of-mouth and social media.

<p>American Tactical Apparel is committed to leading the covert carry industry through innovation, design, quality and patriotism. There is NO BETTER WAY to secretly carry your pistol and equipment. These pants are engineered for battle and for everyday operating. American Tactical Apparel is designed for warriors, by warriors. We build high-quality tactical pants that are tough as nails and <strong>100% made in the USA!</strong></p>

<p><strong>American warriors, fighting and dying in Chinese-made pants... that’s a load of crap!</strong></p>
<p>We believe that America did not become the greatest nation on Earth by selling out to other countries. Sure, it costs us more, but we will not sell out. If you want a great pair of pants made right here in the USA, it's going to cost you more money, but you get a carry system that gives you comfort, concealment and access like never before.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>Hello everyone,</span></p>
<p><span>My name is Sheila Denanyoh and I am the designer/ founder behind the up and coming label, ILL-LA-LA DESIGNS.  ILL-LA-LA DESIGNS was recently selected to participate in the highly acclaimed Africa Fashion Week New York this summer (2012) and in order to participate we need your help to raise $2,100.

My fascination with color is always made apparent in my designs as I believe it is important to feel alive in the clothes one wears. As part of feeling alive I want my passion to be purposeful, bringing joy to not only myself but to others. Through my love for designing I have given back to my community via the Looks for Books project and continue to make decisions that impact the continent of Africa and my native land positively.  As a graduate from the Kent State University with degrees in International Relations and African Studies, I continue to use life experiences and lessons as a model for growth and success. </span></p>

<p>Hey there. I'm Kate and I've been running Missfit Clothing for around 3 years now. I started creating my own clothing line at the age of 14, after teaching myself the basics of sewing, as a way of earning some extra pocket money.</p>
<p>Fast forward 8 years, and Missfit Clothing was born. It stayed as a side project, running along side my full time job until 6 months ago, when I took a giant leap, quit my job and began working for myself full time. We only live once, and I now LOVE what I do.</p>
<p>Missfit has been growing steadily since it began, but all the profits that I make get put into living costs and back into supplies that I need. This is where your contributions come into play!</p>
<p>The money that is raised here will put towards expanding my range to include more accessories, a new jewellery range and also towards getting the website developed to a professional level, cause in all honesty, I'm useless when it comes to web design! However, the main bulk will put into stocking the supplies I need in order to make waiting times a lot less as currently I need to buy the fabric needed as the order is placed. I would love to be able to get orders made and shipped in a couple of days, and this funding will massivly help that process.</p>
<p>If my target isn't reached, all money will be refunded back to you :)</p>
<p>Take a look at my perks for your donations! Lots of goodies to be had!</p>
<p>If you're unable to make a donation, not to worry!

     My name is Damian ""Dame"" Cephas, I'm a former athlete, coach and visionary.  Aware & Active Apparel Company is aiming to lead the charge in broadening people's idea of cancer awareness.  Cancer awareness should be year round not just one month out of the year.  If we are going to cure cancer we need to change our thinking, change our way of life and change our style.  
 
     Your donation will help launch this Cancer Awareness T-shirt company. A percentage ($5 from each purchase ) of each T-shirt sold will be donated to various charities that help fight all types of cancer. As the founder of Aware & Active , my passion to help cure cancer will be in each of the T-shirts . Please be Aware & Active in the fight to cure cancer and help make the dream of curing cancer a reality and donate. https://www.facebook.com/awareandactive
 
( Please note this not the full collection , just a few selections for your viewing pleasure . We have  12  T-shirts ready to launch , not including Donor only exclusives )
 

 
The Hope
 


     We have set a funding goal of $4,500 . At that level, we'll have enough money to place an order with our manufacturer and fill our first orders . As well as handling marketing and legal fees.


     As we see it Cancer awareness should be year round! All cancers are equally important and we won't rest until YOU feel the same way.
 
     Ultimately our goal is to evolve into a gobal lifestyle brand that's consistently raises Cancer awareness.  As we grow we want to increase awareness.  This means releasing new ideas, creating viral content, and organizing volunteer and donation efforts to continue our mission to change the world . https://www.facebook.com/awareandactive

In 1911 he founded the 'Chevrolet Motor Car Company of Michigan'.The conviction, strength and passion of the man, who was ahead of his time in many domains, drives us to pay a tribute to him, by imitating his inventiveness in our own domain: watchmaking.His slogan 'Never Give Up' inspires us in each of our projects to always take on new challenges. Driven both by this inventive spirit and our desire to pay a tribute once again to Louis Chevrolet, our designers have created, within the Frontenac Collection, a new range with a unique concept and with a patent, developed by our engineers: the flying date. Since innovations never come alone, this most original concept also makes it possible to read in low light or at night or, thanks to the application of luminous material (SLN C1) on the date indicator, the circular digital calendar as well as the hands and indexes.In order to create this unique date indication, our watchmakers adapt the original movements used on these timepieces, be it the robust ETA 2824/2 automatic or the Ronda 515 quartz movement.Once they have passed through our workshop, these engines are ready to accommodate our flying date.Get a special discount while supporting us on the futur retail price of the watches.These 4 models stand out by the deep reflections of the galvanic dial, the lightness of the skeleton hands as well as the luminous material finely applied on the whole dial (indexes, calendar, reflector & hands). The robust housing is made of 316L stainless steel and is water-resistant down to 50 metres. The crystal is made of high-resistance anti-reflective sapphire glass on both sides.These timepieces are equipped with a reliable Swiss movement: the automatic calibre ETA 282/2, visible from the back.The perforated leather strap is inspired by the old racing driver's gloves, which provides a genuine comfort on the wrist. Get a 30% discount while supporting us on the futur retail price of the watches.These 5 models with a sportier design are decorated with a honeycomb pattern similar to the front calender of the Camaro.As on the automatic version, we find the skeleton and the luminous material finely applied on the entire dial (indexes, calendar, reflector & hands). The sturdy case is made of 316L stainless steel and is water-resistant down to 50 metres. The high-resistance sapphire crystal is anti-reflective on both sides.These timepieces are equipped with a reliable Swiss movement, the Ronda calibre R515. The bottom crystal is decorated with a honeycomb pattern.The nylon strap has two coloured stripes, giving the watch an ever sportier design.Your watch is supplied with a leather strap and a nylon strap. No tool is needed to switch them, thanks to the lug bars. Our watches come with a pin buckle. You have the possibility to complete your order with a folding buckle (stainless steel) that is faster and easier to put on your wrist. For this, would you please pay and additional CHF 35.00 as you choose your watch so that we can identify your wish.Proud of our know-how, we offer you quality and innovative watches at affordable prices. We are among the pioneers in Switzerland to sell our watches exclusively via the Internet so as to avoid intermediary fees and guarantee you the fairest price.We are proud to propose our automatic version in Swiss Made label and the quartz one in Swiss Movement. Our passionate team works relentlessly to offer you ever more innovative and quality watches.Déterminé et emplit d'une incroyable force le poussant à ne jamais rien lâcher, l'homme d'origine Suisse immigra aux Etats-Unis où il eu une carrière de pilote de courses automobile remplie de succès. Il fonda en 1911 l'entreprise de voiture ""Chevrolet Motor Car Company of Michigan""La conviction, la force et le désir de cet homme, en avance sur son temps dans bien des domaines, nous pousse à lui rendre hommage en étant tout autant inventifs que lui dans notre domaine: l'horlogerie.Son slogan: ""Ne renonce jamais"" (Never give up), nous inspire dans chacun de nos projets pour toujours relever de nouveaux défis.Fort de cet esprit innovant et de notre volonté de rendre une fois de plus hommage à Louis Chevrolet, nos designers ont imaginé, au sein de la collection Frontenac, une nouvelle gamme au concept unique avec un brevet développé par nos ingénieurs: la date volante.Une innovation ne venant jamais seule, ce concept des plus original permet également d'avoir une lecture parfaite de nuit ou par faible luminosité. Grâce à l'apposition de matière lumineuse (SLN C1) sur l’indicateur de date, le calendrier numérique circulaire ainsi que les aiguilles et les indexes.Afin de parvenir à cette indication de date inédite, nos horlogers adaptent les mouvements originaux utilisés sur ces garde-temps, qu'il s'agisse du robuste mouvement automatique ETA 2824/2 ou du quartz Ronda 515. Une fois passés par nos ateliers, ces moteurs sont prêts à accueillir notre date volante.Profitez d'un rabais spécial en nous supportant par rapport au futur prix de vente des montres.Ces 4 modèles se démarquent par les reflets profonds du cadran galvanique, la légèreté des aiguilles squelettes, ainsi que la matière lumineuse finement apposée sur l'ensemble du cadran (indexes, calendrier, réflecteur & aiguilles). Le boîtier robuste est en acier inoxydable 316L étanche 50 mètres. La glace est en saphir antireflet deux faces à haute résistance.Ces garde-temps sont équipés d'un mouvement suisse fiable, le calibre automatique ETA 2824/2 visible depuis l'arrière.Le bracelet en cuir perforé est inspiré des anciens gants de pilotes automobiles, et apporte un grand confort de la montre au porté.Profitez d'un rabais de 30% en nous supportant par rapport au futur prix de vente des montres.Ces 5 modèles au design plus sportif sont décorés d'un nid d’abeille rappelant les calandres des Camaro.On y retrouve, comme sur la version automatique, les aiguilles squelettes, ainsi que la matière lumineuse finement apposée sur l'ensemble du cadran (indexes, calendrier, réflecteur & aiguilles). Le boîtier robuste est en acier inoxydable 316L étanche 50 mètres. La glace est en saphir antireflet deux faces à haute résistance.Ces garde-temps sont équipés d'un mouvement suisse fiable, le calibre quartz Ronda R515. La glace de fond est également décorée avec un nid d'abeille.Le bracelet en nylon arbore deux bandes de couleur, lui conférant un esprit des plus sportifVotre montre est fournie avec un bracelet cuir et un bracelet nylon. Aucun outil n'est nécessaire pour les intervertir.Nos modèles sont livrés avec une boucle ardillon. Vous avez la possibilité de compléter votre commande avec une boucle déployante (couleur acier) plus rapide et aisée à mettre au poignet (uniquement compatible avec le bracelet cuir).

Inspired by technical instruments from the mid 20th century, the VIEW is an automatic watch with unique transparent graphic elements.


The Caliper VIEW was successfully funded in March 2016.  Production is now complete and watches are available for immediate shipping!

Caliper Timepieces harken back to the era of precision instrumentation - when the inner mechanics of our most important tools and devices were crafted for accuracy, dependability and longevity. Caliper Timepieces are a tribute to all that came before the planned obsolescence of the consumer age. 

They don't just mark time - they express values.

The Caliper View is a precision-crafted mechanical timepiece with a self-winding movement that highlights the intricate inner details through glass surfaces on both the front and back.

The Caliper View features a high quality case, milled from surgical-grade, 316L steel, and sapphire scratch-resistant glass on the front and back.

The movement is the Japanese-made Miyota 82S0. It is purely mechanical, requires no battery and will wind automatically when worn (it can also be wound conventionally).

The View’s glass face is perhaps its most distinctive design feature, highlighting the movement from the front and back. It also allowed us to offer a choice of two graphic designs over the movement. The didactic version labels key components of the inner workings. The dot-screen version creates a visual separation between the face and the works.

The graphic elements, glass watch face and the reflective nature of the movement cause the appearance of the View to vary in different light conditions. To appreciate the visual variety, take a look at our Instagram page.

<p>I have been playing soccer since I was 4 years old and have had the opportunity to play on over 4 continents from Asia, to South America, to Europe, and all over North America and the Caribbean. </p>
<p>I have a passion for soccer and for soccer cleats.  I have worn nearly every brand of cleat that is out there and have a clear understanding as to how a cleat should feel and what a player needs in a cleat. </p>
<p>The unique thing about Just Play Cleats is that there are no brands or logos on any of the cleats.  The quality is comparable to all the top brands at lower prices.  Ultimately, players are on the field to play soccer, not for the brand or logo. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to cover the production and shipping for the cleats we need your help!  It is very expensive to ship and produce in large order quantities, which is what we will need to do.</p>
<p>We will rely on ourselves for the majority, but need at least $5,300 to help make this all happen.  This will go towards the production as well as the shipment of the cleats.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal then unfortunately we will not be able to produce the cleats and get them to the public and to those less fortunate around the world.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will not only help to make these cleats available to the market, but more importantly will be helping those less fortunate throughout the world.</p>
<p>We have direct ties to Africa through the non profit organization <strong>Footsteps for Africa </strong>that was started by my older brother Austin.  He has made 3 trips to Africa to deliver both shirts and shoes to those less fortunate and delivers everything himself and films the process so that donators can see exactly where everything goes.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will be able to provide many pairs of cleats for the many soccer players all over the world who do not have the means to play.</p>
<p>Not only will you dinstringuish yourself by wearing cleats without a brand or logo, but you will be making a positive difference in the world.</p>

<p>Polish Cosmetics is a handcrafted line of luxurious, 100% vegan, demi-pressed eyeshadows infused with nourishing organic botanical oils. We take raw materials and blend and mix them into unique eyeshadows that contain no animal parts or extracts, and no fillers, silicones, parabens or dyes. Then, we press them into jars using an ingenious new process to create an amazing product that combines the versatility of pressed eyeshadow with the simplicity of cream eyeshadow for a long-lasting, easy to use product.</p>
<p>We aspire to recapture the avant-garde glamour of Art Deco and blend it with the ethereal sensuality of Art Nouveau so that your natural beauty can shine even brighter.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Makeup Designed By A Makeup Designer"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1296.photobucket.com/albums/ag16/PolishCosmetics/MakeupDesignedByAMakeupLover_zps1123d9a3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Makeup Designed By A Makeup Designer""/></h3>
<p>When I started Polish Cosmetics, I wrote a business plan with a mission: Create luxurious, natural, vegan, pressed eyeshadows. At the time, though a couple of admirable companies fulfilled some of these criteria, I couldn’t find any that met all of them. On top of that, I wanted my customers to feel the joy I did when I found a special new eyeshadow at Sephora- that “<em>Oooh!</em>” moment.</p>
<p><img alt=""Our Regular Line of Eyeshadows"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1296.photobucket.com/albums/ag16/PolishCosmetics/RegularLineEyeshadows_zps26b8b2a6.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Our Regular Line of Eyeshadows""/>Our eyeshadows would be complex, beautiful, and would make people smile. They would have to be the highest quality possible, and would need to feel amazing. I wanted them to be pressed in some form, but have the possibility for experimentation. And, of course, they had to be vegan, and as natural and organic as possible.</p>
<p>We considered every aspect of our product and packaging from our customers perspective. We do not use fillers, or repackaged mica, and this step alone meant we spent over a year perfecting our base. Since many people are allergic to Bismuth Oxychloride, or irritated by talc, we renounced both, and when it came to which oils we'd use, we chose the most moisturizing and universally appreciated. The eyeshadow shades are also all formulated to work well as eyeliners when dampened (I recommend using eyedrops instead of water for increased cohesion, binding, longevity, and pigmentation).</p>
<p>For packaging, we decided the jars and bottom labels had to be translucent so you could see what colors the eyeshadows were when stored upside down. Then we topped it off with a sealed filter for your convenience.</p>
<p>I've always loved the distinctive modernity of Art Deco, as well as the curving loveliness and elegance of Art Nouveau. So while thinking of design ideas that would work for a luxurious cosmetic company, I thought mixing the two would give just the right amount of exuberance and femininity. Alphonse Mucha, Georges Barbier, Erte, Gustav Klimt and Tamara de Lempicka were all significant influences, and happen to be some of my favorite artists as well. Polish Cosmetics is for the modern woman who appreciates the beauty of the past, while looking forward to the future.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Demi Pressed"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1296.photobucket.com/albums/ag16/PolishCosmetics/DemiPressed_zps20ba0c4f.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;"" title=""Demi Pressed""/></h3>

<p>Demi-Pressed is the term we coined to describe our eyeshadows. They are pressed into jars with a softer force, using our secret process, than is typically used for regular pressed eyeshadows in pans. This creates several advantages. Pressing into jars, instead of pans, allows you extra room to use your makeup the way YOU want to. You can use it with a brush, like a standard pressed eyeshadow, but in a jar you won't end up brushing half of it out of the container. Or you can use your fingers, like you would for a cream eyeshadow. It's even formulated so that it will break up more evenly if you'd prefer to turn it into a loose eyeshadow. </p>
<p>We do highly recommend using an eyeshadow primer or base with our (and all) eyeshadows, as it significantly improves longevity and pigmentation, and decreases fall out. If you use a brush with our eyeshadows, we also recommend ""patting"" on the eyeshadow, like I do in the video at 1:12, then lightly blending, instead of using broad swipes.</p>

<p>Carmine is an extract from the Cochineal Beetle. The beetles are ground up and mixed with a solution, then the extract is used a dye. Almost all major cosmetics companies (including those who make a big deal of being cruelty-free) use this in the majority of all pink, purple and red makeup. I first heard about the use of carmine/ cochineal in cosmetics a few years ago. My first reaction was simply pure disgust, but the more I thought about it, the more upset I got. Some people would say “They’re just beetles,” but it seemed so unnecessary that I couldn’t forget it. I stopped buying anything with carmine in it then, and when I was ready to start Polish Cosmetics, it was already a given that it would be vegan and cruelty-free. We would be better than the standards, would never test on animals, nor use suppliers who do, and we’d never use any type of animal extract whatsoever.</p>

</div><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Here we go again! Last year, fans of Gravity Falls helped raise over $8,000 to bring back the officially licensed Grunkle Stan Fez. The show has since ended but that doesn't mean we have to stop producing merchandise for the show. In fact, there's a host of new merchandise in the works right now!</p><p>The company involved with producing these items recently reacquired several key licenses that allow me to order new hats, wallets, and other items. Some of these, like the fez, were previously sold since the show began but either limited in quantity or location. Some, like the Journal 3 wallet pictured in the campaign card, have <i>never </i>been produced before. By helping out, you're making history.</p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I'm looking to raise at least $3000 through this campaign to help off-set the costs of the production run. This is only a small fraction of the total cost needed but will help substantially. A minimum of 576 of each headwear item and a minimum of 600 of each wallet must be ordered to be produced.

Last year, fans of Gravity Falls helped raise over $8,000 to bring back the officially licensed Grunkle Stan Fez. The show has since ended but that doesn't mean we have to stop producing merchandise for the show. In fact, there's a host of new merchandise in the works right now!The company involved with producing these items recently reacquired several key licenses that allow me to order new hats, wallets, and other items. Some of these, like the fez, were previously sold since the show began but either limited in quantity or location. Some, like the Journal 3 wallet pictured in the campaign card, have never been produced before. By helping out, you're making history.What We Need & What You GetI'm looking to raise at least $3000 through this campaign to help off-set the costs of the production run. This is only a small fraction of the total cost needed but will help substantially. A minimum of 576 of each headwear item and a minimum of 600 of each wallet must be ordered to be produced. This is your opportunity to get one before anyone else. Here's the breakdown of approximately where your money will go to.~70% For the production costs of the licensed merchandise~10% Novelty items (Items like postcards included with each fez)~10% Shipping Supplies (Boxes, tape, labels)~10% Fees (Indiegogo & 3rd Party fees)By supporting this campaign you'll have the option to get the following items

<p><strong>We are Distinct. <br/></strong><strong>Everyone is born distinct. There are always some parts deep within our hearts that could not be unified by the world. We love to stand out and proudly express ourselves.</strong></p>
<p>    Here is a simple challenge – open your closet and try to find clothing that meets the following criteria: lively designed, finely made, and most importantly, uniquely produced. Pretty hard, right?</p>
<p>    We can always find clothing that is lively designed - we love them. Spirited graphics and lovely shapes always fill us with energy and passion. They make us feel motivated and be ready to challenge and embrace anything in the days ahead.</p>
<p>    But color is not the only part of young dressing style; we demand comfort, quality and uniqueness as well. We want our clothes to be comfortable, with fine materials and smooth cuts. We demand our clothes to be of quality, preserving their colors and shapes through time. We ask our clothes to be unique, rarely seen but always recognized.</p>
<p>    Wouldn't it be brilliant if we combined these criteria we love – color, comfort, quality and uniqueness – all in one fashion collection? A unique fashion collection that is vivaciously designed; carefully made; joyfully fitted; and, most valuably, limited quantity.</p>
<p>    No matter who you are, whether a young college student preferring fashion and relaxation or an older gentleman wishing to feel elegance and young, wouldn't this “Unique” be the best choice for daily life? Perhaps also on a Friday night party or a Saturday morning cruise?</p>
<p>    Yes, definitely.</p>
<p><strong>We are Peerless. <br/></strong><strong>No two people are the same, so are the products from Nichol Alexander - vivacious design, unparalleled quality, and limited quantity.</strong></p>
<p>    We are delivering uniqueness to everyone. We created the very first limited produced fashion collection, not to present exclusiveness and elitism, but to:</p>
<p>- Champion uniqueness;</p>
<p>- Emphasize spirited young life style;</p>
<p>- Express energy and passion;</p>
<p>- Deliver comfort and perfection;</p>
<p>    To champion uniqueness, we stepped up to do what no other fashion brand has ever tried. Instead of mass producing a few designs and flood the market, Nichol Alexander strictly limited the quantity produced for each design under 250 pieces, making every Nichol Alexander truly peerless and valuable.</p>
<p><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.nicholalex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/top2.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>   To fit the life style of being young, we added different types of clothes into the product collection, like hoodies and shorts. When you wear them, you can feel the spirit of youth dancing through your body.</p>

<h3>Special update on Feb. 12th, 2013</h3>
<p>A letter from our customers and a letter to everyone</p>
<p>Since the announcement of our 13S semester special for students, we are receiving lots of greeting emails everyday. Among those, one email asking about our product prices and uniqueness attracts our special attention.</p>
<p>“Good evening NA, Why would a student pay for Nichol Alexander when he could buy something from mature companies such as Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers, Vineyard Vines, etc for the same price or even less? … How Nichol Alexander clothing line prides itself on its “uniqueness”?… These clothes are just not something I would immediately take the risk in purchasing because I saw a flier or an email.  At the right price maybe, but not immediately. ”</p>
<p>We believe many of potential customers, not only students but also others, would raise the same questions, when they first know Nichol Alexander through emails, Facebook pages or other channels:</p>
<p>Why Nichol Alexander’s products are listed at premium prices? How Nichol Alexander’s products are “Unique”?</p>
<p>We realized that replying this letter is also a brilliant chance for us to reach out to our customers and shed some light on the questions and doubts they may share. We hope, by publishing our reply, we are able to help everyone with a better understanding of Nichol Alexander as a brand.</p>
<p>“Good Evening</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter.</p>
<p>There has been quite a debate inside Nichol Alexander since its establishment on how should we price our products.</p>
<p>We wanted to build Nichol Alexander to be a high-end brand. Therefore, we designed our products with quality, detail, and profession.</p>
<p>We then wanted to build this brand to be unique, different from RL, CK or any other high-end names. So we decided not to put our designs into mass production and limit our production quantity. To ensure our uniqueness, we make only a little over 200 pieces for each design, including all sizes, which means anyone who wear our clothes should never expect someone near him wearing the same ones.</p>
<p>We also wanted to sell our brand to ourselves, college students. As you mentioned in your previous email, we also agreed that not many college students would pay for a $130 hoodie from a brand they never heard of – that price is simply out of range. Without sacrificing quality and continuing our vision of delivering quality products to college students like you and me, we are constantly offering special discounts to students. Currently, we are giving out special discounts like you have received: $25 for sending an email; $5 for giving us some feedback basing on our posts on “indiegogo”; and $10 for each flyer posted around; a good way to engage our friends and customers and help college students. Through this promotion, anyone can get a free T-shirt for posting one flyer. With a couple more, you can receive a polo shirt. Or, with free credit, $60 does not sound like a bad deal for a great hoodie; moreover, it’s a 200 pieces limited quantity.</p>
<p>With many other factors that went into our price (new startup design, marketing, etc.), this brief explanation only scratched the surface. But we do hope this has shed some light on your question. We sincerely hope you will find the quality you hold in every Nichol Alexander in the same way we do.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Best regards, <br/>Nichol Alexander”</p>
<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p>1. <strong>What colors, sizes and cuts will the clothes come in?</strong><br/> You can pick any design, color, sizes offered on our website, as long as they are not sold out.<br/><br/></p>
<p>2. <strong>How do I choose my size?</strong><br/> Please follow the size chart provided on our website.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Are there any clothes for women?</strong><br/> Currently, we only offer men’s clothes, but we will have collections for women in the short future. Keep an eye on us.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Do you ship perks internationally?</strong><br/>Yes, but Free Shipping with in the US.</p></div>","“Born distinct, made peerless”

We realized that replying this letter is also a brilliant chance for us to reach out to our customers and shed some light on the questions and doubts they may share. We hope, by publishing our reply, we are able to help everyone with a better understanding of Nichol Alexander as a brand.
“Good Evening
Thank you very much for your letter.
There has been quite a debate inside Nichol Alexander since its establishment on how should we price our products.
We wanted to build Nichol Alexander to be a high-end brand. Therefore, we designed our products with quality, detail, and profession.
We then wanted to build this brand to be unique, different from RL, CK or any other high-end names. So we decided not to put our designs into mass production and limit our production quantity. To ensure our uniqueness, we make only a little over 200 pieces for each design, including all sizes, which means anyone who wear our clothes should never expect someone near him wearing the same ones.
We also wanted to sell our brand to ourselves, college students. As you mentioned in your previous email, we also agreed that not many college students would pay for a $130 hoodie from a brand they never heard of – that price is simply out of range. Without sacrificing quality and continuing our vision of delivering quality products to college students like you and me, we are constantly offering special discounts to students. Currently, we are giving out special discounts like you have received: $25 for sending an email; $5 for giving us some feedback basing on our posts on “indiegogo”; and $10 for each flyer posted around; a good way to engage our friends and customers and help college students. Through this promotion, anyone can get a free T-shirt for posting one flyer. With a couple more, you can receive a polo shirt. Or, with free credit, $60 does not sound like a bad deal for a great hoodie; moreover, it’s a 200 pieces limited quantity.
With many other factors that went into our price (new startup design, marketing, etc.), this brief explanation only scratched the surface. But we do hope this has shed some light on your question. We sincerely hope you will find the quality you hold in every Nichol Alexander in the same way we do.
Thank you
Best regards, Nichol Alexander”

<p>Our original idea was to create a luxury line of credit cards for status minded people- gold, platinum and diamond encrusted cards for the rich and famous.

<p>All of our materials are sourced locally here in Seattle.

<p>The two of us have depleted what limited resources we have, but would kill for the following: an upgraded laser engraver that can produce cards at an acceptable output; R&amp;D that includes process of incorporating EMV chip and streamlining magstripe application at more of a mass production level; a beefed up website that wasn't created by one of our little sisters; a professional product photographer.</p>
<p>Our #1 goal is to complete our Visa/MC certifications, which would enable us to provide our cards to Financial Institutions.

Why is this important?

Risks & Challenges

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What this offer?</h3>
<p>Assorted garments printed with a Lapsus Linguae logo.</p>
<p>We're puttin' the fun intae ""crowd funding"" as a pre-order thingy to ensure we order the right amount of the right kind, whilst simultaeously avoiding plunging our reluctantly stingy Scottish hands into our porridge-and-chip-fat-soaked pockets.</p>
<p>The logo will be pure silver on black items, or silver with a black edge on white and baby pink items. The picture of the white shirt pictured (abovewise) shows you roughly what to expect, though they'll arrive signifcantly MORE SILVERER - the one in the photo was worn by yours truly, so, like its owner, it has endured many gigs, is over the age of seven, and has consequently lost some of its sheen... </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pledgy</h3>
<p>If you fund this, you WILL get the garment you ordered: This isn't an ""all-or-nuthin"" campaign, the only consequence if we fall short of our £500 funding goal is we'll pay Indie Gogo a larger surcharge, but it wont effect you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pricey</h3>
<p>A while back I was bandying my fat mouth all over facebook with implausiblly cheap numbers until VAT and other nasty surcharges slapped some sense into me...I ought therefore, to sheepishly remark that the prices we're asking for include a mark-up, but not a huge one, and that funds raised will go towards helping us to complete and promote the new records   ""Ghosts"" and ""This Is Puberty"".</p>

<h3>Stand around, then deliver</h3>
<p>Once the campaign is complete, it'll take;-</p>
<ul>

<p>There are three levels of ""perk"" to cover postage and packaging - within UK, within the EU and rest of the world. Please include the appropriate one in your shopping basket.

sunglasses a year.  They break too easily, scratch too fast, and we all 
know they are easy to leave behind.  After a while we just couldn't stand
 it any longer, and we didn't want to drop another 100$ on a pair of 
Oakley's or Ray Bans, or head to the local wings and spend 5$ on 
something that would make us look ridiculous, and wouldn't even protect our eyes.  That's why we created our new snap series .  For the consumer. </p><p>Our sunglasses
 bring together style, durability, and best of all, a low price tag.  We
 created our hinged arm series so that you can easily snap off your arms
 and snap them onto a different pair.  This creates an endless number of 
combinations for any color bathing suit you decide to wear to the beach
 that day. On top of that all our sunglasses feature
polarized lenses and a memory frame plastic that can 
withstand massive amounts of pressure.

and materials we will be using in our snap series. Our final product

Every Contributor will receive a pair of Far Out Sunglasses, even if we do not meet our goal of $4,500What's up Indiegogo..We are here to launch our new Snap Series of Far Out Sunglasses. Not sure about you, but as kids we went through about 3 or 4 pairs of 
sunglasses a year.  They break too easily, scratch too fast, and we all 
know they are easy to leave behind.  After a while we just couldn't stand
 it any longer, and we didn't want to drop another 100$ on a pair of 
Oakley's or Ray Bans, or head to the local wings and spend 5$ on 
something that would make us look ridiculous, and wouldn't even protect our eyes.  That's why we created our new snap series .  For the consumer. Our sunglasses
 bring together style, durability, and best of all, a low price tag.  We
 created our hinged arm series so that you can easily snap off your arms
 and snap them onto a different pair.  This creates an endless number of 
combinations for any color bathing suit you decide to wear to the beach
 that day. On top of that all our sunglasses feature
polarized lenses and a memory frame plastic that can 
withstand massive amounts of pressure. Hope you guys enjoySnap Series Sunglasses: When we get funded, our snap series model
will be our signature line, which is why we brought it to you guys on Indiegogo first.  We worked with our manufacturer to bring this simple
 yet amazingly useful line of sunglasses to life.  We need money to get 
samples and further the design, colors, 
and materials we will be using in our snap series. Our final product 
will contain polarized polycarbonate lenses with a durable, lightweight, memory frame plastic. As a reward for your pledge, you will be able to 
choose from any of our six colors listed below.You will be able to match any of our frame colors above with any of our lens colors below, so make sure to keep that in mind when pledging.

Why we need Indiegogo
We are working with a leading manufacturer of frames and lenses which are 
hand assembled, polished, and packaged to our exact specifications. But 
we need your help to go from a working prototype to full scale production.
 Your pledge will go towards the mass production of our shades which is 
necessary for the factory to turn out the quality we want on a larger 
scale. If the goal is met and barring any setbacks I expect to be 
shipping these out to you by April 2014.  Just in time for summer.REWARDS:
As a reward for your pledge we're going to send you the first production run of our Snap Series Sunglasses.
All reward levels will include a free 
microfiber pouch along with a Far Out sticker.  Each pledge will also get free shipping everywhere in the United States (Please add 7$ for International Shipments). At the end of the Indiegogo campaign, you will receive a
 survey
so you can specify which colors you would like.

The 5-year warranty is limited to the heating element itself, not the coat, fabric, or battery. We created the Ravean C6 heating system to stand up to even the toughest elements, including the ones in your washing machine. And to prove our confidence in what we’ve made, every jacket comes with a 5-year warranty on the heating system. If at any time your heating element malfunctions, we’ll simply replace the entire coat, no questions asked. 


Yes! Water Resistance!


The Ravean C6 is made from light, breathable, water-resistant material DWR (Durable Water Repellant) is a special coating added to fabrics at the factory to make them water-resistant.

<p>The design of the dial is all about proportions and finding the balance. <br/>The Okapi dial is carefully designed to create a discreet, luxurious but edgy look.<br/>The dial comes in a variety of carefully selected colors, meticulously chosen to add character, giving each piece its own symbiotic identity with the logo positioned at the 3 o’clock marker.<br/><br/>The collection features polished, hand applied time markers that give every timepiece their own characteristic feature. <br/><br/>In addition, the sapphire glass is not simply cut and stamped, it is carved and grinded into a unique form, again giving a unique identity to each timepiece.</p>

<p>Many people purchase their watches based on aesthetic appeal and fashion trends.<br/>By uniting the discretion and minimalism of Swedish design, while being inspired by the great icons of the 70’s, we have made our own interpretation as if the Okapi was made during this iconic period to create something bold and unique. <br/><br/>The Okapi collection is our first release to the market.<br/>The series projects through its bold outlook to challenge the conventional shape of most timepieces, regardless of price bracket or tier.<br/><br/>The design is sleek, eye-catching and stylish, a gender-neutral piece that is comfortable on the wrist. <br/><br/>Simply stated: a bold minimalist's dream. </p>

<p>To further guarantee that every watch is created to our high standards we will keep a constant contact with our factory and we will have quality controls both at the factory and in Sweden before shipping the watches to our Backers.</p>

The design of the dial is all about proportions and finding the balance. The Okapi dial is carefully designed to create a discreet, luxurious but edgy look.The dial comes in a variety of carefully selected colors, meticulously chosen to add character, giving each piece its own symbiotic identity with the logo positioned at the 3 o’clock marker.The collection features polished, hand applied time markers that give every timepiece their own characteristic feature. In addition, the sapphire glass is not simply cut and stamped, it is carved and grinded into a unique form, again giving a unique identity to each timepiece.


The watch hands have been specially customized to match the logo details on the crown and case back. The approach is to give our clients a refined way to catch the time easily, while giving a distinctive look without distracting features. The hands are a trademark feature that will be continued on future collections.


Many people purchase their watches based on aesthetic appeal and fashion trends.By uniting the discretion and minimalism of Swedish design, while being inspired by the great icons of the 70’s, we have made our own interpretation as if the Okapi was made during this iconic period to create something bold and unique. The Okapi collection is our first release to the market.The series projects through its bold outlook to challenge the conventional shape of most timepieces, regardless of price bracket or tier.The design is sleek, eye-catching and stylish, a gender-neutral piece that is comfortable on the wrist. Simply stated: a bold minimalist's dream. 



Every Watch comes with an Italian calf leather strap and one additional Milanese mesh strap that matches the watch case.
Below you´ll find the collection and color combinations we offer for this campaign (you can choose if you want a Quartz or an Automatic version)

The Okapi Quartz is powered by a Swiss Made Ronda 1069,The movement is considered a high-end quartz movement.The Ronda 1069 uses 6 jewels as bearings. (These jewels are small but important components in your watch that reduce friction between metal parts).

At the moment I moved to Netherlands in search of a better life and I started my bachelor in Business and Economics at University of Groningen.  From the age of 16 I was helping my grandfather to run his workshop, which was producing handmade shoes. Unfortunately, because of his health issues, our family took the decision that it is better for him to close his shop and to retire. I decided to continue his work. A friend  and decided that we will unite our forces and will open our own workshop. At the beginning it was really hard, no one knew about us and we were struggling to pay for our materials and rent. After a few months, everything changed, our costumers loved out products and shared their impressions with their friends and relatives. Soon enough we started having much more orders. It was one of the most beautiful period of my life until the corona pandemic hit the world and affected our business too. We went bankrupt and that's when I decided that it will be better to emigrate and start my life from an empty page, but the thought that I gave up so easily haunts me every day... </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About my products.</strong></h3><p>I have a decent experience in producing handmade leather accessories. All products are made from premium Italian leather. Before shipping, the products are verified to exclude the possibility  of a production defect.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong> What I am asking?</strong></h3><p>A lot teenagers don't know what they want to do in the future, but I do. I don't want to give up my dream because I don't have the necessary amount  of money to start it all over again. At the moment I am working as a delivery guy, but I don't make much money, and in addition to this, I spend them all on rent, utilities and paying for my studies. I would kindly ask you to support me in order to be able to reopen my workshop.

At the moment I moved to Netherlands in search of a better life and I started my bachelor in Business and Economics at University of Groningen.  From the age of 16 I was helping my grandfather to run his workshop, which was producing handmade shoes. Unfortunately, because of his health issues, our family took the decision that it is better for him to close his shop and to retire. I decided to continue his work. A friend  and decided that we will unite our forces and will open our own workshop. At the beginning it was really hard, no one knew about us and we were struggling to pay for our materials and rent. After a few months, everything changed, our costumers loved out products and shared their impressions with their friends and relatives. Soon enough we started having much more orders. It was one of the most beautiful period of my life until the corona pandemic hit the world and affected our business too. We went bankrupt and that's when I decided that it will be better to emigrate and start my life from an empty page, but the thought that I gave up so easily haunts me every day... About my products.I have a decent experience in producing handmade leather accessories. All products are made from premium Italian leather. Before shipping, the products are verified to exclude the possibility  of a production defect. What I am asking?A lot teenagers don't know what they want to do in the future, but I do. I don't want to give up my dream because I don't have the necessary amount  of money to start it all over again. At the moment I am working as a delivery guy, but I don't make much money, and in addition to this, I spend them all on rent, utilities and paying for my studies. I would kindly ask you to support me in order to be able to reopen my workshop. I have dedicated a good amount of time on creating leather goods and I am sure that I will be able to open one in the Netherlands. At the beginning, I will need a place where I can work in peace, I already found a small room which can be used. After that the materials and tools will be bought. That's basically all I need.

<h1>How it works</h1>
<div> </div>
<p>We created the Best Shirt Ever using a patented finishing process that transforms standard cotton into the ultimate performance material. This process starts with combining alternating yarns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic cotton giving it the ability to wick moisture away from your body while also providing protection from water and stains. This allows the garment to repel sweat and water, dry 40% faster than an untreated cotton shirt, and maintain cotton’s natural ability to breathe.</p>

<h1>What’s The Catch? Why Isn’t Every Shirt Like This?</h1>
<p>There are challenges to making this shirt, but they primarily impact us (the producer), and not you (the consumer). The reasons why you haven't seen these shirts at your local department store yet are as follows:</p>
<p>1. <b>The Technology We Are Using Is New</b> - The technology we are using to create The Best Shirt Ever is very new, and larger companies typically take longer to adapt to new trends.</p>
<p>2. <b>The Fabric Is Expensive </b>- The tech fabric we use costs 200%-300% as much as comparable cotton fabrics that do not have tech finishings.</p>
<p>3. <b>The Fabric Needs To Be Specially Milled For Each Color</b> - The good news is that we created a stainproof shirt. The bad news is - we can’t dye this shirt. This limits our ability to offer a wide variety of colors, as each color needs to be specially milled by our fabric supplier.</p>
<p>4. <b>Slow Fashion</b> - Much of the fashion industry is gravitating towards “fast fashion”.  Fast fashion focuses on churning out trendy clothing as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Zara and H&amp;M pioneered this model so that they could distribute on trend, inexpensive and disposable clothing before any of their competitors. Since trends don't last long, fast fashion brands don't worry if their clothes fall apart after a few wears. With the industry moving towards fast fashion models, it's hard to find classic, high-quality wardrobe staples that fit well and last. At Clickbait Clothing, by focusing on timeless staples of every man’s wardrobe at an accessible price point, we can spend the time perfecting and iterating to create a better button-down. We'll never be fast fashion. We're ok with that.</p>

Attach to any VR headset and step into a virtual sensory experience like no other.
 
 You’ll be transported into different worlds with the combination of scent, mist, heat, wind, and vibration. This is what VR was meant to be. 
 
 Feelreal is a multisensory mask that, when attached with your VR headset, gives you a full sensory experience in your VR environment. From smell to temperature to vibration, you’ll have all your senses firing as you dive into new worlds.
(Catch & Release VR)Experience over 255 unique aromas and combine them to create out-of-this-world scentscapes that will teleport you anywhere you imagine - past, present, future, or fantasy.
 Because smells trigger the strongest neurological reaction to memory and emotions, you’ll be transporting your entire body and brain to the environment of your choice subconsciously - making your virtual experience even more immersive.
 Plus, your sense of smell is closely integrated with your sense of taste, allowing you to get extremely close to tasting items in VR.Be fully immersed in a world of smells, scents, and tastes and encounter a whole new way to engage with your imagination.Check out our Feelreal Dreams Aroma Set!  We also included Patchouli Aroma Capsule in each set as a bonus - try using Feelreal for relaxing aromatherapy session.Feel the wind in your face as you race to the finish line, the mist of the forest as you stalk your prey, or the pouring rain while you battle in a storm.
Virtual Reality just got a whole lot more real. Your VR fire doesn’t have to be cold anymore. Trigger heat or cold to fully experience your environment. Micro-coolers and micro-heaters let you sense the cool chill of the mountain air or be surrounded by the warm desert gust of your virtual world.
 You can even program temperature effects for objects and events. Experience the scorching heat of a dragon’s flame or the icy blast of a winter storm.
 And if you’re ever getting too heated during your VR session, the temperature mechanism can help cool you down and defog your headset. No more sweaty mask rings! But we didn’t stop there. Haptic Feedback Motors create vibrations that you can feel through your face. Whether it’s a punch from an opponent, a high-speed motorcycle chase, or the rumble of a dragon’s roar, you’ll FEEL the vibrations resonating through your face and body.Fully immerse yourself and your body into whole new worlds. Sense the physical touch of interactions with characters and events in your adventures. This is next level VR.  There are no limitations with Feelreal. Enhance your entertainment, your gaming, even your meditations and home environment with scents, weather simulation, and haptic vibrations!Feelreal supports a variety of media forms and already has a few ready-to-experience tracks for you to enjoy when you receive yours! Open 360 videos with Feelreal player and watch them like never before! Download existing Feelreal tracks from our expanding online library or ​create your own to share with friends.Feel the rush of mountain air as you wingsuit down the Alps or smell the ancient, mystical scent of Fangorn Forest. With Feelreal, you’ll experience your favorite movies and videos in a whole new way! Transform the way you game. Feelreal supports several popular VR games and experiences right out of the box. Feel the heat and force of an exploding rocket, experience the blast of cold winter wind as you ride a dragon, and smell the gunpowder and earthy scent of rotting flesh as you fight off hordes of zombies.Fully immerse yourself in your fantasy world and smell, feel, sense everything like you’re actually there.  Jump into one of the amazing worlds created by our developers and independent creators designed specifically to stimulate your senses. With every door you open and each choice you make, you’ll explore new sensual possibilities and broaden your scope of experience.
 Dive deep into relaxation and presence as you enjoy not just the sights and sound but also the scents and sensations of your favorite meditation environments. Drift into a remote beach while you feel the gentle ocean breeze or breath in the relaxing aroma of fresh pine leaves in a still forest.
 Be fully immersed and sink into the sights, sounds, and smells of a powerful meditation retreat. You can even set your own preferred aromas to jumpstart your body into a meditative state. With vibration, smell, heat, and air, you know Adult VR will get even better. You’ll be able to smell the perfume, feel the soothing breath on your lips, and even experience the tingle of a kiss on your cheek. Full sensory VR means maximum sensual stimulation.
 You can even use Feelreal without a VR headset and control it via mobile app. Use it as your own personal aromatherapy device and get relaxing or focus-inducing scents wherever you go.
 The most powerful sensory system is our ability to smell. Scents are processed through your olfactory bulb, which is closely related to the area of your brain which processes memories and emotions. No other sensory system passes through this same area, so the only way to trigger these deep emotional feelings is through smell.
 Adding scents to your virtual experience creates a surge of emotions, memories, and sensation that is only paralleled by actual reality. By seeing, hearing, and smelling your environment, you’ll be fully immersed and lost in your virtual world. VR will become reality to your senses, and you’ll experience immersion like never before. Get ready to Feelreal. The synchronization of your visual, auditory, motor, temperature, and olfactory (smell) senses through your VR headset combined with Feelreal allows you to completely transport your body and mind into whole worlds and environments without ever leaving your room.
 Every one of your senses is engaged - making your body feel and your mind think that you are in a separate reality. Besides a full body haptic suit, there is nothing more virtually immersive than this. You’re in the action, the rush, the fantasy - and you can FEEL it. It’s like you’re actually there - for real. We developed a reliable scent generator that holds an easily replaceable cartridge containing 9 individual aroma capsules. Choose and combine any of the 255 scents available! Install and change them depending on your VR experience.
 Our scents are all marked by our CleanScent guarantee. We only use absolutely safe sources and practices to create our aromas, so you can experience your worlds without worry.
 All our aromas are exclusively designed by acclaimed perfumer, olfactologist, and perfume critic, Bogdan Zubchenko. Combining techniques from over 20 years of experience, Bogdan created and designed a plethora of memorable and diverse aromas and scentscapes to give you the ultimate smell sensory experience! Feelreal is equipped with two force feedback haptic motors that kick in when there is a perceived impact, touch, or force in your virtual world. You’ll feel the punch of an opponent and shake with the trembles of monster’s roar through the powerful touch of vibrations. This makes the experience so much more real.
 We used an ultrasonic ionizing system to create water mists that can be sprayed at you for the visceral sense of liquid on your face. The system is silent and controlled - so it won’t interrupt your session.
 Whether it’s rain, an ocean spray, mist in a forest, or the spit of some dungeon creature, you’ll feel it and be thrown even deeper into your virtual experience! Dual micro-coolers and a micro-heater generate temperature and weather functions - allowing you to feel a hot breath or a cool breeze. The micro-coolers blow cool air to your face to simulate wind, while the micro-heater warms up the air in your mask to simulate heat coming from a fire or the environment.
 The temperature simulators can also be used to regulate your own body temperature and help defog your VR headset. Cool off while you level up and continue swinging your swords and lightsabers without worry of a sweaty mask afterwards. 
 We worked hard to make sure Feelreal doesn’t intrude on your VR session. That’s why we spent extraordinary effort designing the mask to be as lightweight and as easy to use as possible.
 Feelreal uses a magnetic mount to firmly attach itself to your headset and only weighs 7oz (200g)! That’s as light as a hamster! No fumbling around with attachments and no significant additional weight to your face.
 We designed replaceable headset adapter for each compatible headset. If you change or upgrade your headset, you can simply purchase a new adapter rather than buying a new Mask!Explore the VR multiverse with no extra burden to hold you down. Feelreal is ready to use out of the box! From receiving your mask to experiencing its magic, we designed Feelreal to be a completely seamless experience.
 After attaching the magnetic mount system, simply insert your scent cartridges, snap on the mask, and you’re good to go! The mask uses bluetooth or WiFi to connect with your headset so no wires are needed. Feelreal connects with any VR headset. Whether it’s PC, console, or even a phone setup, you’ll be able to experience full-immersion VR with your preferred platform.
 We already have several titles ready for you to experience when you get your own Feelreal, and there’s much more coming soon! From zombies, to dragons, to Youtube 360 and our own created worlds - you’ll have no shortage of full sensory experiences to enjoy on first release!
 
 
 
 
 
 Not seeing your favorite title supported? Don’t worry! Adding Feelreal support is super easy! Our free Feelreal Video Editor lets you easily add scent and sensory tracks to any movie, video, or 360 recording. It works almost like subtitles - simply drag your preferred effect in the timeline over your desired scene an save the Aroma Track. Open the track in Feelreal Video Player and enjoy the experience or share it with fellow fans through our online library.
 Game developers can use our SDK for Unity and Unreal Engine to easily patch sensory effects into their games and experiences. Our SDK offers unprecedented creative possibilities to immerse players into your virtual worlds!   
 VR has allowed us to step into amazing, awesome, and utterly unique worlds. Through it, we’ve been able to escape on epic adventures and experience things we would never experience prior.Until now, those experiences were limited to only two senses - limiting your ability to fully immerse. Your conscience still partially remained in the reality outside the headset because your other senses were not engaged in the virtual world. Emotionally, you may have been detached, because smell, your major sense associated with memory and emotion, was not being stimulated in your simulations.With Feelreal, all your senses will be firing through your VR experience. Get totally lost in the dreamscapes of virtual reality and experience full immersion as you smell, feel, and sense every environment, gust of wind, forceful punch, and delightful scent. Witness virtual reality blend with actual reality as aromas, memories, and feelings enter your experiences, and be ready to Feelreal. Don’t see your platform? Message us, and we’ll see what we can do!Feelreal Dreams Basic Aroma Set includes the following scents:  
  
 We are a team of hardworking engineers and designers lead by visionary entrepreneur. To be honest as people we’re quite a diverse bunch. Some of us love tech and all the coolest new gadgets, others adore poetry and immersive theater. But we all share a common passion for VR and entertainment. Every one of us vividly remembers their first time trying VR helmet and the feeling of sheer excitement after teleporting into new reality. But we always felt that it’s capable of even moreNow we feel extremely proud that we finally have the opportunity to break the boundaries of what was thought possible and introduce new dimensions to our favorite medium. And we’re focused and determined to get every little detail right.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Mountain, and like you, I enjoy walking, running, lifting, playing, and doing pretty much everything barefoot. It all started in 2009. From the 4-Hour Workweek blog and the book Born to Run, I discovered barefoot running. It made sense. It felt right. 6 months later, I completed the LA Marathon, bare soles to the road for 26 miles.</p>
<p>From then, there was no turning back. But I still had to spend five days a week in a business environment. What's a modern caveman to do? On a casual Friday, I wore my FiveFingers and my colleagues freaked out. This is not a good thing for an accountant. So I put up with my regular work shoe until one day. I came home, so frustrated with the thick heels that I tried to trim them down with a hand saw. It didn't work as I imagined, and the shoes were just ruined. </p>
<p>It was in this moment, this moment of failure, that inspiration struck. We need a shoe that has the barefoot feel we love, with the classic look people expect. A shoe for Primal Professionals. Whether you work an office, a restaurant, a hospital, or a beat, the Primal Professional, with its slip-resistant sole, is for professionals from all walks of life. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Features</h3>
<div>
<div> I set out to create a shoe that looks indistinguishable from the most conservative Oxford. A shoe you could wear through a job interview and into a black tie affair. Without compromising barefoot comfort. How is this possible? We came up with a couple tricks of the eye that you'll love.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best way to illustrate the key features of the Primal Professional is to compare them against a Traditional shoe, and earlier attempts at a barefoot dress shoe.  A Traditional shoe has a heel lift, arch support, and a thick sole. We hate these things, but they're what people expect visually of dress shoes. Earlier attempts take a dressy upper and attach it to a flat sole, so there's no heel lift, no arch support, and a thin sole, but dressy looks are lost. Through creative design, our patent-pending Time CapSole allows the best of both worlds. While it may look like there is a heel lift and arch support, those structures are actually hollow, and allow the foot to sit flat inside for a real barefoot feel.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another key feature of the Primal Professional is the innovative shape. A Traditional shoe has a dressy, narrow tip, but it severely constricts the toes. An earlier attempt shoe might try a wider tip, but that looks too casual. In developing our shoe, we identified where the toes are within the toebox, allowed ample space for them up to that point, then dramatically tapered everything thereafter into a dressy tip. Tricks of the eye. Like a hunter-gatherer in camouflage.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Pride</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>As a minimalist, the last thing I want is another cheap consumable made from exploited workers and environmental pollution. Without compromise, this shoe had to be made ethically and sustainably. By searching locally for vendors, nearly every part of our product is proudly made in the USA, with only the lasts made next door in Mexico. The leather in our shoes, tanned in Wisconsin, comes from Texas steers. Our unique outsoles are made in Missouri, as are the molds that make those outsoles. Our design was done by an artist in California.</div>
<div style=""border-color: initial !important;""> </div>
<div>Sustainability isn't just about manufacturing, but also how long that product lasts. To keep the Primal Professional on your feet, and out of a landfill, we had to ensure the very best build quality.  The final product is being assembled by Weinbrenner, an employee-owned company in Wisconsin whose high caliber shoes have carried America's heroes for 120 years, including the brave firemen on 9/11. We are proud to say the Primal Professional is made in the USA, by a shoemaker that produces some of the finest, most durable footwear in the world.</div>

As a minimalist, the last thing I want is another cheap consumable made from exploited workers and environmental pollution. Without compromise, this shoe had to be made ethically and sustainably. By searching locally for vendors, nearly every part of our product is proudly made in the USA, with only the lasts made next door in Mexico. The leather in our shoes, tanned in Wisconsin, comes from Texas steers. Our unique outsoles are made in Missouri, as are the molds that make those outsoles. Our design was done by an artist in California.
 
Sustainability isn't just about manufacturing, but also how long that product lasts. To keep the Primal Professional on your feet, and out of a landfill, we had to ensure the very best build quality.  The final product is being assembled by Weinbrenner, an employee-owned company in Wisconsin whose high caliber shoes have carried America's heroes for 120 years, including the brave firemen on 9/11. We are proud to say the Primal Professional is made in the USA, by a shoemaker that produces some of the finest, most durable footwear in the world.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

These shirts are both a chance for you to wear your convictions on your sleeve and a great opportunity to open doors to greater conversation. We believe that these shirts can help elevate the discourse and that they pose the challenging questions to the inconsistent, the disaffected, and the apathetic.
We know that our generation is poised to make change -- will you help us change hearts and minds?   What We Need & What You Get This time around, our shirts really do represent a consistent ethic of life not only in the designs, but also in the production process - this is why we need your help!  All shirts will be ethically produced: both sweatshop-free AND printed with eco-friendly inks by a  local Pittsburgh print shop. Due to the sweatshop-free nature of the shirts this time around, our production price has increased substantially -- we need more money to get off the ground in the first place. The increase in per-shirt price is looking at something close to $3: this is due both to the improved multi-color designs as well as the ethically-sourced shirts.  If we reach $900, we will print 1 design. If we reach $1800, we will print 2 designs. If we reach $2700 (that's our goal), we will print 3 designs. 
We know people are loving ALL of the designs you voted on, so as an added bonus, if we reach $3500 in fundraising, we will print an EXTRA design (3+1) to be made available at the same time as the rest of our shirts -- voting for this design will be sent to a run-off on our Facebook page upon fulfillment.     The Impact Your individual contribution will help us in manifold ways:  We are able to demonstrate our pro-every-life values by printing on sweatshop-free shirts! We help each campaign contributor by including some of our educational materials in each package -- both elevating the discourse with what we wear and in how we approach the arguments for human rights and the right to life. Each shirt we sell gets us closer to being able to effectively attend conferences and activism events all over the US.    Risks & Challenges  Because we've worked with this print shop before, we're not too worried about production, but reaching our goals is certainly going to be more challenging than in past years!  We've grown our fan base and our outreach and I think we are well equipped to reach our fundraising goals. The most important part of this campaign is YOUR sharing and outreach with friends and activist partners who YOU believe will appreciate our message and our goals. If you want all of the designs printed to ensure you get your favorite shirt, then share like crazy!    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help!

</div></div>","What is The Didi Project? 
The Didi Jewelry Project teaches jewelry making to women living in poverty in India. We sell the jewelry in the U.S and abroad to help the women we work with generate an income.  Our jewelry is beautiful, unique, and affordable.  Didi is the Hindi word for sister.  Our goal is to help our sisters in India create the lives they deserve.   


Our Story

 I first went to India when I was 16 years old. I was struck by the poverty and inequalities I saw, but also by the kindness and generosity in the people, many of whom had so little.  I returned to India three more times and volunteered in a school, an orphanage, and women's shelters.  I wanted to find a way to help and empower women in India, but I didn't know how.
Then in 2012, I volunteered to teach a jewelry making class in a women's homeless shelter in Berkeley.  I saw the sense of accomplishment and pride within the women I was working with when they made jewelry.  From this experience I decided to combine my life-long love of creating jewelry with my passion for helping women in India.  
I founded The Didi Jewelry Project in 2012.  The Didi Jewelry Project provides women in India with an opportunity to reset their lives.  I teach them how to make jewelry.  They the hand-craft necklaces, bracelets, and earrings that are sent to the U.S.  This jewelry is sold in stores in the U.S and abroad, online, in catalogues, and at fairs and events.  The women are well paid and all proceeds go back into the project.
I have worked with women in India who are HIV positive, women who are widows, and women who are victims of sex trafficking.  All these women are victims of poverty and they are severely stigmatized by society.   Because of this they are stuck in their poverty.
An important tenet of the project is that we don't just give away aid but that we share a skill so that the women we work with can help themselves and gain confidence and a feeling of accomplishment.  Although it is a common saying. we strongly believe that, ""Give a man a fish and he eats for a day.  Teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime.""








Your Support  
The Didi Jewelry Project needs to grow in order to fully support these women.  They need full-time employment in order to support their families. Currently we do not have a big enough market or enough sales for this to occur.   The good news is that our sales have been increasing each year, and we recently had our first catalogue order and our first private label commission.   We are growing and have had some success, but we need to take it to the next level.

 Vinita Bahadur, the project coordinator in India, and I are working hard to develop the project, but we are doing all our work unpaid. We need funds to develop the project, to develop our products, and to obtain the accounting and marketing expertise needed to grow the project.
                              We are asking for $11,000 












Business advisor: meet with a business advisor once a month, create a revised business plan
