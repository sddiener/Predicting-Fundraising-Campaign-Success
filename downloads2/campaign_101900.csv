How was the idea born? 
A man called Marvin Heemeyer inspired us for this. People call him America’s Last Hero and we completely support this opinion.  He showed the world that even one man can stand up against the System, to fight what he believes in and defend his rights.


It is that kind of human perseverance, our relentlessness and power of will that we took as a foundation for our game.
   Description 
This game takes places in an alternate universe in the America of the 70-ies. A military experiment resulted in the vast majority of the population of a paradise island being infected and mutated.

The protagonist is an engineer John Kowalski, after the global epidemic he locks up in his garage and creates his killer-machine called the Sphere. 
With his machine John attempts to save his daughter and the other survivors on the island. Hordes of mutated Bonker creatures and U.S. armed forces will stand in his way.   What makes this game entertaining? 
Desperation is a hardcore vehicular combat arcade, it has a full motion picture storyline, multiple story branches, dynamic gameplay full of the spirit of survival and non-stop action.
The player will delve into a detailed universe with its own cultural values, atmosphere and style. In order to give the player a richer sense of the story and to reveal as much of the plot as possible we use graphical novel (aka comics) in between the levels.
Our characters are fully developed individuals with their unique personalities, views on life and motives.
 Desperation is the story of a brave and courageous desperado.



In the game the player will drive an incredibly powerful and heavy 3 ton juggernaut machine that is upgradeable with additional heavy weapons and plenty of other features.


The enemy is a new breed that physically resembles humans – the BONKERS! 
They are strong and fast, they are intelligent and cruel as beasts. They are capable of mutating to an unnatural size and they evolve by joining into herds, which makes them a force that crashes everything that stands in its way.

There no rules, no escape plan, no one to come to save you, only self-reliance and a will to live!
   How is this game paid for?  
Desperation is standalone, not free-to-play.

Cause it's damn awesome that's why. In today's world we are surrounded by products and advertisements and we get stuck in the drone of our day to day. This game is an escape from that, something you can play any where any time and allows you to interact in the real world! </p><p>Game Screenshot Scanning a QRCode on a coaster in the local pub!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468700375/thumb_IMG_1038_1024_mxc3xx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>The idea comes from an old game I used to play as a child, it was called Barcode Battler. You would cut UPC Codes from cereal boxes and scan them into a device that would assign random numbers, you would press a button for attack and it would do some random mumbo jumbo and you would either kill the opponent barcode or it would kill you! I had so much fun scanning everything in our house trying to find that epic boss.

I have created augmented reality apps for advertisement platforms, for art and discovery exhibits, for corporate based apps and now I want to transfer a part of that AR world to my game concept. </p><p>The idea is simple, you scan any barcode any where; UPC, QRCode, it doesn't matter! The code instantly transforms into a 3D Bad Ass Monster in front of your very eyes! It's yours now! Collect as many as you can! Each scan becomes a chance to gain a new monster or item for your collection. </p><p>Battle them together in one of many arenas that you can unlock!

</div><p><br/></p></div>","What the heck is this?This is my passion project. Something I have wanted to create for many years and with your help, were going to make this happen! Why? Cause it's damn awesome that's why. In today's world we are surrounded by products and advertisements and we get stuck in the drone of our day to day. This game is an escape from that, something you can play any where any time and allows you to interact in the real world! Game Screenshot Scanning a QRCode on a coaster in the local pub!The idea comes from an old game I used to play as a child, it was called Barcode Battler. You would cut UPC Codes from cereal boxes and scan them into a device that would assign random numbers, you would press a button for attack and it would do some random mumbo jumbo and you would either kill the opponent barcode or it would kill you! I had so much fun scanning everything in our house trying to find that epic boss. I want to recreate this feeling of discovery and adventure and share it with everyone!I have been in software development my entire life, and I have created numerous applications for the business world. I have created augmented reality apps for advertisement platforms, for art and discovery exhibits, for corporate based apps and now I want to transfer a part of that AR world to my game concept. The idea is simple, you scan any barcode any where; UPC, QRCode, it doesn't matter! The code instantly transforms into a 3D Bad Ass Monster in front of your very eyes! It's yours now! Collect as many as you can! Each scan becomes a chance to gain a new monster or item for your collection. Battle them together in one of many arenas that you can unlock! Fight them to level up there XP and skills to create your ultimate champion. We plan to create a multiplayer aspect where you can fight your friends collection for bragging rights! The ultimate goal is to have your monsters battle right on the desk in front of you star wars chess style! Seriously! (image taken from wired.com)What We Need & What You Get For Making it HappenI think this is a game that hasn't been created yet, a game that will WOW people and a game that will live on and expand into many many different genres. I can make this happen with your help, the bulk of the cost in this game is 3D development and character acquisition. We want LOADS of content in this game, were talking in the thousands here! Let's build the coolest game ever made!We are looking for $40,000.00 Dollars to get a beta version completed. The more money we raise the better the content will be in our game. The money will be divided into 3 Categories:
$30,000.00 Mobile App Development
$5000.00 3D Character Development Acquisition and Graphics
$5000.00 Marketing

<p>We here at Strange Matter Studios, with the support of our backers, are completely invested in building a next gen 3D action-MOBA game. All of us here were passionate Paragon players and desire to see the game's soul return---but with all of the potential we knew it had. That's exactly what we have been working on all year, and exactly what we continue to pour our hearts into everyday. Our upcoming Paragon-inspired game, Fault, has the feel of Paragon, but with a focus on competitive-level play and mechanics that will keep players returning for more. For newcomers, we hope you see the potential of the genre and choose to support our studio on this journey of innovation. And for our beloved community that has been holding it's breath for over 1.5 years, we hope you are able to fall in love with this project as you watch it evolve into the game we have always wanted.</p>

If you've been watching our <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fault"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitch game page</a> or checking out Fault content on YouTube, you've seen the game we've made up to this point. Having already developed a fully-functional and feature-filled 5v5 MOBA, we now need your help to fill in and polish the remaining components. Every dollar helps us keep matchmaking servers running and to push larger and more impactful updates. We plan to generously reward our contributors who are helping us realize our goals. Thanks for the consideration of your support of Fault and we hope to see you on the battlefield!</p>

<p>Our game and map design revolves around action-packed, competitive play. Players should never be isolated from action or allowed to simply go into ""autopilot"" in lane. To achieve such a game, we needed inspiration from many sources, so we drew from Paragon and many other MOBAs. As a result, you'll see influences from more than just Legacy and Monolith Paragon. The aesthetic of the map is clearly Monolith. We liked the pace and action in Monolith games more, but we wanted the scale to be larger and players to have more options of pathing when traversing the map, more akin to Legacy play. As for itemization, we wanted an open store so any item could be built at any time, allowing players to express their skills by reacting to their opponents' builds without restrictions. Lastly, we wanted every choice the player makes to be impactful. So we designed the Aspect/Faction system (a fusion of League's rune system and Paragon's deck affinity system) to allow the player to make impactful gameplay decisions both before and during the game. All of this adds together to make a system that can be as versatile or targeted as the player chooses. As for game times, we want games wrapped up around 30-40 minutes. All of these designs are still under construction, and will be continuously adjusted as we experiment and tweak during Alpha tests.</p>

<p><br/><i>Everyone at our studio works tirelessly in their free time to make this Project happen (just look at how far we've come in the past 11 months). We have done this purely as volunteers, often sinking personal funds into the studio's necessities along the way. But now, with the support of the community, we have finally hit the point where we know that financial support will accelerate even further the pace of updates and content for our players.</i></p>
<p><u>First, why is the goal <i>flexible</i>?</u><br/>Meaning we keep the funds regardless of if we reach our goal.</p>
<p>To quote Indiegogo: ""Choose flexible funding if any amount of money will help you reach your campaign objective and you'll still be able to fulfill your perks.""</p>
<p>Because our perks are deliverable regardless of hitting our goal, flexible funding is the appropriate funding type for our campaign.<i> </i>Fixed goals are when ""you have a strict go/no-go threshold."" And that is not true of Fault. Strange Matter will continue our work regardless of if we hit our goal. So the purpose of our campaign is to <strong>accelerate</strong> progress and to recruit skills/services that are outside the skill sets of our current team. A fixed goal would imply that if we don't reach the goal then we won't be able to continue working, and that simply isn't true. </p>
<p><u>Why $100,000 USD?</u></p>
<p>We chose the goal by considering what our needs are and what is realistic for our backers to provide. This amount of capital will give us sufficient funds to bring the game into a state that is ready for marketing to the gaming community at-large (see the next section). In order to attract all backgrounds of gamers, Fault will need to have the fit and finish of a AAA-level game. Right now, we have some truly impressive skill sets on our team, but in order to hit the AAA standard, there are tasks that we would prefer be tackled by specialized experts. The next section describes how the money will be utilized. In this way, there is no wasted time nor money. <br/><br/><u>With funds beyond our goal</u>, we will be able to start looking at features well beyond the scope of our current team. This primarily includes brand new <strong>character models and animations, </strong>as well as brand new <strong>level assets </strong>that meet the quality expectations of a Paragon-like game.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576517070/u1gob73971xvwdmma5qz.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>

<p>We already have optimized pipelines for making heroes, items, and improving upon 3D art. So the money received will go into the additional features and content required for the polish and upkeep of the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Hero animation and particle effects</u> - We know that the look and feel of the game, especially one similar to Paragon, is paramount. So these funds will allow us to get the expertise needed to polish hero animations and improve particle effects for hero abilities where they are lacking.<br/> </li>
<li>
<u>Code-base</u> - Our players deserve a virtually bug-free experience on dedicated servers that run smoothly. Thus, much of the funds will go to getting professional help or consultation for elements in the code that are best-tackled by specialized programmers. With enough funding, our first full-time employee would likely be in this department.<br/> </li>
<li>
<u>Servers</u> - The price of servers adds up, especially when running many at once to support quick match load times. You buying an early access key will easily cover your server usage up to the full release of the game (late 2020) and beyond! <i>Based on our current data, we can guarantee that no more that 5% of crowdfunding will go toward this purpose. </i><br/> </li>
<li>
<u>Sound</u> - We want nothing short of Paragon-level sound for upcoming heroes and sound reworks.<br/> </li>
<li>
<u>Art</u> - We will need 2D art to fill the item store, menus, and loading screens. Additionally, we will need concept art in order to produce new skins and heroes when we have the funding and pipeline to achieve it.<br/><br/><i>In the interest of transparency, you should also know that any money received for content in Unreal Engine is subject to the 5% royalty fee. This includes crowdfunding.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576517103/bpg4xa4if02behqwzz5p.jpg"" src=""""/></i><br/> </li>

<li>The satisfaction of supporting the rebirth of your favorite game, but in an even better form!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Early access </strong>- Starts in the first quarter of 2020! Servers will be up 24/7, so play whenever you like! Spread the word too, because in order for Early access to be successful, we will need a lot of players. All Early Access keys come with 5 heroes unlocked by default: Gideon, Sparrow, Steel, Greystone, and Khaimera. <strong>Account progression during early access will stay for full release.</strong><br/><i>See the ""<strong>What costs money and why?"" </strong></i><i>section for more details.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Holiday access </strong>- Dec 20th 8 pm EST to Dec 29th 2 am EST -  Want to play Fault over your Holiday break? How does over a whole week of 24-hour servers sound? You will have to play the Alpha build, which comes with some Alpha-level bugs, but check out some recent gameplay, people are having a blast playing and the extra support we receive can go a LONG way. <strong>All holiday players will have ALL HEROES UNLOCKED for the holiday event, </strong>after which the heroes will be locked again based on the accounts perk level (for Early Access). Note: These are likely to be North American servers only, unless we sell enough keys to support EU matchmaking as well. Stay tuned!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Coins </strong>- Pay-only currency within Fault. 1000 coins will be roughly equal to $10. We will roll out coin rewards when Early Access starts.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>""Tough"" Gideon </strong>- A Gideon cosmetic skin exclusive to people who support us at the <u>silver</u> level and higher on IndieGoGo. See image below. It will never be for sale in our in-game store. We reserve the right to make a recolor of this skin as an incentive for the launch of console editions of Fault. We will try to roll out this reward as the keys get claimed, but this task is low priority and we don't guarantee they will be out until Early Access (so please wait until then to contact us about this reward).<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>""Action Hero"" Twinblast </strong>- A Twinblast cosmetic skin exclusive to people who support us at the <u>founder</u> level and higher on Indiegogo. See image below. It will never be for sale in our in-game store. We reserve the right to make a recolor of this skin as an incentive for the launch of console editions of Fault. We will try to roll out this reward as the keys get claimed, but this task is low priority and we don't guarantee they will be out until Early Access (so please wait until then to contact us about this reward).<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Permanently Rename an Item </strong>- Yes, that's right, <u>master</u> level supports can collaborate with the Game Designers for Fault to rename an item (of their choice) <strong>permanently. </strong>The new name must match the style and theme of other items in the store, but each item can be personalized by the backer <strong>within reason</strong>. The name must be agreed upon by the backer and the Game Designers. Additionally, we will consider engaging such items in the lore of the Fault universe when fitting.<br/> </li>

<p>This section is simply to explain how we are choosing to monetize our goods and why.<br/>Are we going to take money for skins? <strong>Yes. </strong><br/>Are we going to take money for heroes? <strong>Also yes. </strong><br/>But both <strong>heroes and skins will also be unlockable by playing the game.</strong></p>
<p>Some of you may wonder if this is fair, so let us explain. Strange Matter Studios doesn't just want to bring our favorite heroes back and say it's done... we want to create a game that can grow and thrive for years, and that's gonna take a lot of support. Being a small studio, we do not have the financial resources of studios like EPIC who get royalties on their engine and can afford to take financial hits in order to make game content more accessible to their players. We will have to use the same funds from selling the game to improve the game. Further, the standard of asset fidelity is set so high that we will need more funds than most other games to make our ideas a reality. So as a team we discussed this and decided it was best that we adopt a model that is established by many other MOBAs: <i>unlockable heroes</i>. But to show our respect to people who find it unfair to pay, we are making all of the content created from free marketplace assets (Heroes, Skins, and Emotes) unlockable, free of charge, by simply playing the game and using the earned in-game currency. Such a model still gives players the <strong>option </strong>to support the long-term development of the game by sending us some funds for an unlock. We hope you understand that we are trying to respect ALL of our community members: those that are happy to pay AND those that aren't. The primary benefit being that this model will help support the development of the game far after the ""free"" assets are exhausted. </p>

We will be updating this project page with new graphics and information, but the perks will not change! We may add more perk types or levels if there is demand.
UPDATE: The same heroes in the ""High Five"" perk are available as an add-on item in your cart when you select any other perk.
 

 

     
We here at Strange Matter Studios, with the support of our backers, are completely invested in building a next gen 3D action-MOBA game. All of us here were passionate Paragon players and desire to see the game's soul return---but with all of the potential we knew it had. That's exactly what we have been working on all year, and exactly what we continue to pour our hearts into everyday. Our upcoming Paragon-inspired game, Fault, has the feel of Paragon, but with a focus on competitive-level play and mechanics that will keep players returning for more. For newcomers, we hope you see the potential of the genre and choose to support our studio on this journey of innovation. And for our beloved community that has been holding it's breath for over 1.5 years, we hope you are able to fall in love with this project as you watch it evolve into the game we have always wanted.

In-progress HUD:
Our philosophy is that the gameplay and game mechanics are foremost. If you've been watching our Twitch game page or checking out Fault content on YouTube, you've seen the game we've made up to this point. Having already developed a fully-functional and feature-filled 5v5 MOBA, we now need your help to fill in and polish the remaining components. Every dollar helps us keep matchmaking servers running and to push larger and more impactful updates. We plan to generously reward our contributors who are helping us realize our goals. Thanks for the consideration of your support of Fault and we hope to see you on the battlefield!
     
Our game and map design revolves around action-packed, competitive play. Players should never be isolated from action or allowed to simply go into ""autopilot"" in lane. To achieve such a game, we needed inspiration from many sources, so we drew from Paragon and many other MOBAs. As a result, you'll see influences from more than just Legacy and Monolith Paragon. The aesthetic of the map is clearly Monolith. We liked the pace and action in Monolith games more, but we wanted the scale to be larger and players to have more options of pathing when traversing the map, more akin to Legacy play. As for itemization, we wanted an open store so any item could be built at any time, allowing players to express their skills by reacting to their opponents' builds without restrictions. Lastly, we wanted every choice the player makes to be impactful. So we designed the Aspect/Faction system (a fusion of League's rune system and Paragon's deck affinity system) to allow the player to make impactful gameplay decisions both before and during the game. All of this adds together to make a system that can be as versatile or targeted as the player chooses. As for game times, we want games wrapped up around 30-40 minutes. All of these designs are still under construction, and will be continuously adjusted as we experiment and tweak during Alpha tests.
Episode 2:

   
 


    
Everyone at our studio works tirelessly in their free time to make this Project happen (just look at how far we've come in the past 11 months). We have done this purely as volunteers, often sinking personal funds into the studio's necessities along the way. But now, with the support of the community, we have finally hit the point where we know that financial support will accelerate even further the pace of updates and content for our players.
First, why is the goal flexible?Meaning we keep the funds regardless of if we reach our goal.
To quote Indiegogo: ""Choose flexible funding if any amount of money will help you reach your campaign objective and you'll still be able to fulfill your perks.""
Because our perks are deliverable regardless of hitting our goal, flexible funding is the appropriate funding type for our campaign. Fixed goals are when ""you have a strict go/no-go threshold."" And that is not true of Fault. Strange Matter will continue our work regardless of if we hit our goal. So the purpose of our campaign is to accelerate progress and to recruit skills/services that are outside the skill sets of our current team. A fixed goal would imply that if we don't reach the goal then we won't be able to continue working, and that simply isn't true. 
Why $100,000 USD?
We chose the goal by considering what our needs are and what is realistic for our backers to provide. This amount of capital will give us sufficient funds to bring the game into a state that is ready for marketing to the gaming community at-large (see the next section). In order to attract all backgrounds of gamers, Fault will need to have the fit and finish of a AAA-level game. Right now, we have some truly impressive skill sets on our team, but in order to hit the AAA standard, there are tasks that we would prefer be tackled by specialized experts. The next section describes how the money will be utilized. In this way, there is no wasted time nor money. With funds beyond our goal, we will be able to start looking at features well beyond the scope of our current team. This primarily includes brand new character models and animations, as well as brand new level assets that meet the quality expectations of a Paragon-like game. 


     
We already have optimized pipelines for making heroes, items, and improving upon 3D art. So the money received will go into the additional features and content required for the polish and upkeep of the game.


Hero animation and particle effects - We know that the look and feel of the game, especially one similar to Paragon, is paramount. So these funds will allow us to get the expertise needed to polish hero animations and improve particle effects for hero abilities where they are lacking. 

Code-base - Our players deserve a virtually bug-free experience on dedicated servers that run smoothly. Thus, much of the funds will go to getting professional help or consultation for elements in the code that are best-tackled by specialized programmers. With enough funding, our first full-time employee would likely be in this department. 

Servers - The price of servers adds up, especially when running many at once to support quick match load times. You buying an early access key will easily cover your server usage up to the full release of the game (late 2020) and beyond! Based on our current data, we can guarantee that no more that 5% of crowdfunding will go toward this purpose.  

Sound - We want nothing short of Paragon-level sound for upcoming heroes and sound reworks. 

Art - We will need 2D art to fill the item store, menus, and loading screens. Additionally, we will need concept art in order to produce new skins and heroes when we have the funding and pipeline to achieve it.In the interest of transparency, you should also know that any money received for content in Unreal Engine is subject to the 5% royalty fee. This includes crowdfunding. 



     

The satisfaction of supporting the rebirth of your favorite game, but in an even better form! 

Early access - Starts in the first quarter of 2020! Servers will be up 24/7, so play whenever you like! Spread the word too, because in order for Early access to be successful, we will need a lot of players. All Early Access keys come with 5 heroes unlocked by default: Gideon, Sparrow, Steel, Greystone, and Khaimera. Account progression during early access will stay for full release.See the ""What costs money and why?"" section for more details. 

Holiday access - Dec 20th 8 pm EST to Dec 29th 2 am EST -  Want to play Fault over your Holiday break? How does over a whole week of 24-hour servers sound? You will have to play the Alpha build, which comes with some Alpha-level bugs, but check out some recent gameplay, people are having a blast playing and the extra support we receive can go a LONG way. All holiday players will have ALL HEROES UNLOCKED for the holiday event, after which the heroes will be locked again based on the accounts perk level (for Early Access). Note: These are likely to be North American servers only, unless we sell enough keys to support EU matchmaking as well. Stay tuned! 

Coins - Pay-only currency within Fault. 1000 coins will be roughly equal to $10. We will roll out coin rewards when Early Access starts. 

""Tough"" Gideon - A Gideon cosmetic skin exclusive to people who support us at the silver level and higher on IndieGoGo. See image below. It will never be for sale in our in-game store. We reserve the right to make a recolor of this skin as an incentive for the launch of console editions of Fault. We will try to roll out this reward as the keys get claimed, but this task is low priority and we don't guarantee they will be out until Early Access (so please wait until then to contact us about this reward). 

""Action Hero"" Twinblast - A Twinblast cosmetic skin exclusive to people who support us at the founder level and higher on Indiegogo. See image below. It will never be for sale in our in-game store. We reserve the right to make a recolor of this skin as an incentive for the launch of console editions of Fault. We will try to roll out this reward as the keys get claimed, but this task is low priority and we don't guarantee they will be out until Early Access (so please wait until then to contact us about this reward). 

Permanently Rename an Item - Yes, that's right, master level supports can collaborate with the Game Designers for Fault to rename an item (of their choice) permanently. The new name must match the style and theme of other items in the store, but each item can be personalized by the backer within reason. The name must be agreed upon by the backer and the Game Designers. Additionally, we will consider engaging such items in the lore of the Fault universe when fitting. 

Tough Gideon:

Action Hero Twinblast:
 
How do I claim my perks?
At least 24 hrs before each access event begins, you will receive a code at the email on your Indiegogo account for each key in your bundle. Each code is redeemable on ANY playfault.com player account after logging into the website. Keys redeemed on our website will have their respective Steam Game Key sent out via the email on the player account. Holiday keys purchased after the 18th will be emailed redeemable codes within 24 hours. Email support@strangematter.co if you need help with anything. 

    

Update: Holiday access extended!


 
    
This section is simply to explain how we are choosing to monetize our goods and why.Are we going to take money for skins? Yes. Are we going to take money for heroes? Also yes. But both heroes and skins will also be unlockable by playing the game.
Some of you may wonder if this is fair, so let us explain. Strange Matter Studios doesn't just want to bring our favorite heroes back and say it's done... we want to create a game that can grow and thrive for years, and that's gonna take a lot of support. Being a small studio, we do not have the financial resources of studios like EPIC who get royalties on their engine and can afford to take financial hits in order to make game content more accessible to their players. We will have to use the same funds from selling the game to improve the game. Further, the standard of asset fidelity is set so high that we will need more funds than most other games to make our ideas a reality. So as a team we discussed this and decided it was best that we adopt a model that is established by many other MOBAs: unlockable heroes. But to show our respect to people who find it unfair to pay, we are making all of the content created from free marketplace assets (Heroes, Skins, and Emotes) unlockable, free of charge, by simply playing the game and using the earned in-game currency. Such a model still gives players the option to support the long-term development of the game by sending us some funds for an unlock. We hope you understand that we are trying to respect ALL of our community members: those that are happy to pay AND those that aren't. The primary benefit being that this model will help support the development of the game far after the ""free"" assets are exhausted.

<p>The core of the card game is about matching symbols with the NPC in order to build a connection and have a conversation. Complete a sequence successfully, and the conversation will move forward in a positive way, though ending in discordance will still move your story forward with a meaningful experience. Not only that, but different symbols represent different personality traits and communication styles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.gifyu.com/images/matilde.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Special ability cards will allow you to manipulate and drive the conversation and provide strategies to deal with symbols you may not yet have in your deck. These also represent character traits and manners of speaking--one character might chatter endlessly, while another diplomatically qualifies and clarifies their statements.</p>
<p>The patterns you form with the NPC will also impact the direction and outcome of the encounter. Agreement and concordance earlier in the exchange can lessen the consequences of later disagreements, while certain misdirections may open up new opportunities.</p>

<p>After each conversation, you are given the opportunity to gain a card from the other character, essentially learning from each experience. Eventually, you'll have even more ways to grow and change your deck, and discover what that means for your character.</p>
<p>Beyond what's in the demo, we have a number of additions planned to add depth without upping the complexity too much.

<p>Including your hometown of Bartow, there will be 10+ locations to explore. Each location hosts a small cast of characters with their own communities and stories to uncover. You'll meet fast-talking salesmen, feuding brothers, swindlers, and grouches, but also other young adults just leaving home for the first time, a mother struggling to support her child, spice farmers doing their best in a world that's leaving them behind, and many others.</p>

<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>The Global Game Jam® (GGJ®)  is the biggest collaboration of game makers in the world, with an expected 50,000 game developers coming together in physical locations around the world in over 100 countries, creating 10,000 games based on just 1 theme in just 48 hours! Our event running in January 2020 will be the 12th year of GGJ.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we need help?</h3>
<p>Running GGJ centrally costs around US$350K a year, including staff costs for our Executive Director, Executive Producer and Technology Manager, as well as web hosting, online tools, video production, GDC related costs and GGJ NEXT costs.</p>
<p>Traditionally this budget has been covered by our sponsors. This year we are really thankful to all of our sponsors, especially our headline sponsor (Thanks Microsoft!), but we still didn’t quite manage to hit our planned fundraising target.</p>
<p>As well as the expected costs, we have been trying hard to plan and save so that we can bring you a fantastic, fresh, new updated website. This means fundraising for this and next year for us is even more important.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we want to achieve from doing this</h3>
<p>Redeveloping the GGJ website is a massive goal, and it comes with a large price tag, so we are turning to our community to help us out with helping to get a little closer to our fundraising goal for 2020.</p>
<p><strong>If every jammer donated just US$1, this would fill the spot of a whole headline sponsor, and it would give us a real boost to get the new web project underway.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can afford to contribute, but we would really appreciate if you could share this campaign with your friends, coworkers, your cat, and anyone else you think might be interested in helping. If you know any companies who might want to come in at at community sponsor level then please do let them know!  </p>
<p>Retweet, share on Facebook, use the Hashtag #GGJFundraiser and use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read our campaign, and if you are taking part in a jam for 2020, we hope you have a great one! &lt;3</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For many of us on the team this will be our first opportunity to publish the game we've been so tirelessly working on. For the last year we have been building the world, the story, the experience and we just need a little help to get us to the finish line.

<p>Our team is made up of hardworking full time employees that are full time employed outside of our studio. We continue to work on IO in our ""free"" time because we are passionate about the experience we are creating. </p>
<p>Keeping this in mind we have a very tight and diligent production schedule and have worked out many of our pipeline kinks to keep production up and with the most efficient workflow.</p>

</div></div>","About us!
We are a small indie studio located in the PNW, made up of 7 freshly graduated game dev students from Lake Washington Institute of Technology. Making it in this industry is tough. Getting your name and your game out into the world and in the hands of players is truly the dream of any Game Developer. So, we started our own studio from the ground up so we could make our dreams come true! That's where this campaign AND YOU come in! 
We need help with things like licensing, software, hardware and so on. All the bells and whistles to make this game ALL it can be!  

About IO!
Project IO is a first-person, survival horror video game set in the late 1950's, with an emphasis on exploration and narrative.
Players control a Journalist following up on a developing story at a new-age, high tech meat processing plant.
With only a flashlight to help guide you through the recently abandoned facility, you must follow the clues to discover what happened at this once prestigious factory. 
Gameplay:

Solve puzzles and avoid detection
Armed with only a flashlight, use it to uncover secrets and survive
Use the environment pieces around you to distract and confuse your enemies
Avoid letting the tension get to you
​Stay quiet, try not to run.

Platforms:

Windows
Steam 
Xbox One

Check out our website! http://www.t124studios.com



What our team needs:

Help paying for our licenses! Maya/Unity/Substance and so on
Help paying for equipment/hardware! 
Help paying to get our name out there! Marketing is a huge part of getting an indie game off the ground. We can use all the help we can get to get our game out into the world and into the hands of people who LOVE horror survival games! 


 
What you get in return:


The Impact
For many of us on the team this will be our first opportunity to publish the game we've been so tirelessly working on. For the last year we have been building the world, the story, the experience and we just need a little help to get us to the finish line. Finally having the opportunity to share our interactive survival-horror story with the world. We BELIEVE in this game. We WILL finish this game. You can help us make this dream a reality by donating to our campaign.


Risks & Challenges

Our team is made up of hardworking full time employees that are full time employed outside of our studio. We continue to work on IO in our ""free"" time because we are passionate about the experience we are creating. 
Keeping this in mind we have a very tight and diligent production schedule and have worked out many of our pipeline kinks to keep production up and with the most efficient workflow.
** Our studio does NOT practice crunch culture, we value our devs as humans and their health and well being ALWAYS comes first **

<li><p><strong> All players that register for Battle Royale are teleported randomly across to a 40km/25mile size Battle Island which slowly explodes and bursts into fire as the island becomes unstable. </strong></p></li>
<li><strong>To get weapons and armor, players kill zombies which drop randomized gear.  Alternately, treasure boxes spawn which you can also obtain random  weapons/armor. </strong></li>
<li><strong>To get higher grade gear, you can either hunt players and steal their loot, or kill bosses which also spawn.</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>​</strong></p><p><strong>MMORPG Information:​</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong> Upon launch, level cap will be 30, then as the game progresses with more players, we will raise the level cap as we release more content. PvP will be heavy in this game; guilds can declare war and battle anywhere in the open world. With our World War system, every weekend, all guilds fight over an area in a ""King of The Hill"" style battle. The winning guild that holds the position wins, that guild controls the tax rate across the world and collects all the tax money. ​</strong></li>
<li><strong>Main Story Line: Your body was dragged from a fire into town, you woke up the next day and went back to search for your family, you found your  daughter's body torn apart with your wife still dying. She points to a  hill outside before she dies. Satan murdered your family, when you kill  one of his possessed vessels, he laughs and curses you with eternal life - now you wake up somewhere every time you die, never escaping Hell on Earth to be with your dead family.<br/>Join others like you to get stronger together and save the world that Satan has taken over in a final battle. ​</strong></li>
<li>
<p><strong> Side Quests: Story lines can be very boring, we smash the skip button the moment we see it. In AO, we made quests full of memes and jokes.<br/>Maybe a crazy homeless guy with crazy eyes wants to order a pizza with gumballs on it and him and his pet cat discuss bitcoin investments. </strong></p>

The Captain class is good for parties and support, while the  Great Swordsman class is good for soloing and high physical damage.​</strong></li>
<li><strong>2. Ranger - Rangers are a very powerful group-based and solo-based class. Their range in attacks is great enough to kill demons before the demons have a chance to attack. Rangers also have very high evasion which they use to avoid being hit by demons.​</strong></li>
<li><strong>3. Mage - Magicians are both Healers and Glass Cannons of war. Their armor is very weak with extremely low defense but very slightly higher evasion than the Warrior. Their attacks are huge and dominate the battlefield with the highest damage over all classes. ​</strong></li>

<li><strong>9. Capture the Emblem (dunno if we will call it like that) - 3 teams that capture each other's emblem from their base and kill each other to gather points for their teams - Team that has more points at the end wins​</strong></li>
<li><strong>10. Guild vs Guild - Monsters spawn during this PvP - each monster grants 1 point for the team / player killing grants 2 points for the team -&gt; Guild that has most points at the end wins​</strong></li>

Players can choose to join Battle Royale, or continue playing the Horror MMORPG. The massive 30 Mile / 48 Kilometer apocalyptic island explodes and burns with hell fire killing 100s of players not quick enough to make it to the safe zones.​Hell has risen and taken over the world, the last of humanity is in hiding. Your family was killed and your child was tortured to death by demons. Satan then cursed you with immortality so you can never leave this Hell on Earth. You kill yourself, but after dying, you always wake up somewhere else. You find out that you're a part of a prophecy to team up with others like you to destroy Satan in a final battle to save the world.​A simple developer image of how big the world will be. (401 miles / 646 Kilometers)Starter Dungeon insight from our Map Making/Editing Tool​Starter Dungeon from the outside (In-Game)​​ First Town - Night time (In-Game) ​ In Agony Online you will be able to point-click with your left mouse button on the ground/location you want to go to or simply use the WASD keys to move as well. 
​​Battle Royale Information:​
 All players that register for Battle Royale are teleported randomly across to a 40km/25mile size Battle Island which slowly explodes and bursts into fire as the island becomes unstable. 
To get weapons and armor, players kill zombies which drop randomized gear.  Alternately, treasure boxes spawn which you can also obtain random  weapons/armor. 
To get higher grade gear, you can either hunt players and steal their loot, or kill bosses which also spawn.
​MMORPG Information:​
 Upon launch, level cap will be 30, then as the game progresses with more players, we will raise the level cap as we release more content. PvP will be heavy in this game; guilds can declare war and battle anywhere in the open world. With our World War system, every weekend, all guilds fight over an area in a ""King of The Hill"" style battle. The winning guild that holds the position wins, that guild controls the tax rate across the world and collects all the tax money. ​
Main Story Line: Your body was dragged from a fire into town, you woke up the next day and went back to search for your family, you found your  daughter's body torn apart with your wife still dying. She points to a  hill outside before she dies. Satan murdered your family, when you kill  one of his possessed vessels, he laughs and curses you with eternal life - now you wake up somewhere every time you die, never escaping Hell on Earth to be with your dead family.Join others like you to get stronger together and save the world that Satan has taken over in a final battle. ​

 Side Quests: Story lines can be very boring, we smash the skip button the moment we see it. In AO, we made quests full of memes and jokes.Maybe a crazy homeless guy with crazy eyes wants to order a pizza with gumballs on it and him and his pet cat discuss bitcoin investments. 
​
Agony Online is planned to have 6 characters at this moment (maybe more after). Characters customization will only include 6 types of Hair and Face styles.​​The classes that we got planned :​
1. Warrior - Warriors posess the highest single-hit damage attacks and also have the highest Health and Strength over all characters. They have two job classes to choose from, one; Captain, and two; Great Swordsman. The Captain class is good for parties and support, while the  Great Swordsman class is good for soloing and high physical damage.​
2. Ranger - Rangers are a very powerful group-based and solo-based class. Their range in attacks is great enough to kill demons before the demons have a chance to attack. Rangers also have very high evasion which they use to avoid being hit by demons.​
3. Mage - Magicians are both Healers and Glass Cannons of war. Their armor is very weak with extremely low defense but very slightly higher evasion than the Warrior. Their attacks are huge and dominate the battlefield with the highest damage over all classes. ​

1. Warrior [Combatant]​The warrior will be a melee fighter who will use 1-hand swords/axes with shields. He will also have 2-hand/heavy swords after on. He can be a good damage dealer or a tank. His common skills are same for everyone.   At level 30, he will unlock his first skill tree when you complete the storyline quest and become a Soldier . These skills will be same for every Warrior in the game. Here comes the separating skill tree part.   When you hit level 50 and finish our storyline quest,you will unlock the second skill tree . The second skill tree has 2 variations which you will be able to choose - become a Great Swordsman or a Captain.-----------------------------------------   The Great Swordsman will contain high damage skills and you will mainly use 2-hand/heavy swords as primary (you can still use 1-hand swords/axes with shields,but it's not recommended,because your damage will be lower) . You will also be doing higher critical damages.  When you get to level 70,you will unlock the Great Swordsman's next skill tree after completing the next storyline quest and become a Sword Master . One of the skills which Sword Master unlock's will be an area attack and you will charge it by using your Great Swordman's skills. The more you charge it = the higher damage it will deal. The other skill be a strong single target.   The final skill tree will be unlocked after achieving Awakening , which will be done by doing the next storyline quest,which will be on level 90. The skills which will be unlocked are going to be dealing high damage and buff your physical attack for a few seconds.-----------------------------------------We said that at level 50 you can choose 2 variations of skill trees - Great Swordsman or a Captain. Captain will be the tank class,which people will need for bosses and groups. He will be using 1-hand swords/axes with shields. Captain has group buffs,which will provide defense,physical,accuracy,resistances,recovery and more to his group. He will be able to use only 2 group buffs at the same time. The class will also have some attacking skills,but they won't be as strong as the Great Swordsman's ones. When you get to level 70,you will unlock the Captain's next skill tree after completing the next storyline quest and become a Guardian. One of the skills which Guardian will unlock will be a Group Forcefield,which will apply 90% damage resistance to himself and 30% to his group. The other skill will be an area attack dealing high damage.  The final skill tree will be unlocked after achieving Awakening, which will be done by doing the next storyline quest,which will be on level 90. The skills which will be unlocked are going to be dealing high damage and buffing your group once again.  ----------------------------------------- Skill tree in order : Level 1 - Combatant Level 30 - Soldier Level 50 - Great Swordsman or Captain Level 70 - Great Swordsman --------> Sword Master / Captain --------> Guardian Level 90 - Awakening  -----------------------------------------2.

One of the skills which Arrow Master will unlock will be an area attack skill,which will be dealing high normal and critical damages. The other skill will be a strong single target one.  The final skill tree will be unlocked after achieving Awakening, which will be done by doing the next storyline quest,which will be on level 90. The skills which will be unlocked are going to be dealing high area and single target damage.  -----------------------------------------We said that at level 50 you can choose 2 variations of skill trees - Markswoman or a Torment. Torment's skill tree will have skills,which will drain your life and hero stats and poison you to death.  When you get to level 70,you will unlock the Torment's next skill tree after completing the next storyline quest and become a Plague.

37. Jail System - GMs can jail people for certain time which have caused problems or anything against the rules in our game. They won't be able to teleport or text while being there.​
38. Game Polls - we have a poll system inside the game where people are going to vote for things.​
39. Questex System - we can have quests,which can contain certain amount of item rewards where you get to choose only 1 item to receive after you complete it.​
40. Summon monster with items - you can exchange items to a NPC to summon a monster or a mini-boss.​
41. Player most damage reward - we have a system where whenever people are killing a boss,the guy with the most damage can receive a reward (not the normal drop from the boss).​
42. Guild Buff System - whole guild is collecting items that they give to a NPC and gets a buff for certain amount of time.​
43. Accessories Buff System - when pressing the certain hotkey, certain accessories can grant buffs such as dmg,crit chance,hp increase for certain amount of time with a cooldown on the item. ​
​----------------------------------------------------------SKILLS
1. Skills are already ready as well,some of them might be re-coded and changed in terms of what they will do. We also got configuration files which can control damage for monsters/players , cooldown, cast time, calculations on how the skill works.​
2. We can also edit what class does what damage to another class. We can edit the critical rate and damage to players/monsters from skills and normal attacks.​
​----------------------------------------------------------PVP SYSTEMS
1. Battlefield - all the people in the game can register through a NPC for the battlefield. There are 2 teams and the system chooses randomly which player is in which team. When battlefield starts,all the registered players are getting teleported to a map we do and they fight each other for x amount of time we set. Whichever team has more points wins - rewards are honor/reward points. If the points are same,pvp ends in draw.​
2. Guild vs Guild [killing base] - Guild leaders register their guild into this PvP. 2 Random guilds are being chosen to play. Each guild has to protect their own base from being killed. Whichever guild kills the last building of the other guild wins. [If the last building is not killed by x amount of time,ends in draw]​
3. Guild vs Guild [Praying and protecting your leader] - Guild leaders register their guild into this PvP. 2 Random guilds are being chosen to play again. Each guild fight their way through monsters and other guild. Goal is to get on the middle of the pvp map and protect their guild leader while he is praying and gaining points for his side [guild leader can't use potions,skills or move while praying,but he can be attacked and killed]. Whichever guild has more points and rounds won at the end of the timer wins. [I think it was working with rounds and it was something like Best of 3/5]​
4. Battle Royale - The whole server can register for this mode and get teleported to a special map where he has 0 items in his inventory and 0 gear and fights his way through monsters and kills other players. Last man standing wins. [we will probably make it top 3 winning some kinds of rewards]. When PvP ends,players get teleported back and get their personal items and inventory items back.​
5. Duel Tournament - Each player registers himself for a duel tournament. When the duel tournament starts,they get ported to a special map for 1v1. Whichever player does more damage for 2 minutes wins. Tournament winner gets a reward at the end.​
6. Guild War - Guild leaders register their guilds for a huge guild war. The goal is to capture the main objective and setup a flag or whatever in order to win. [time for the guild war can be 1 hour,2 hours etc etc whatever we setup]​
7. Bet Duel System - someone can ask you for a bet duel,after you confirm the bet duel,the trade is being popped and both sides bet an item. Whoever wins the duel gets the other guy's item which he bet.​
8. Group vs Group PvP System - 2vs2 / 3vs3 / 6vs6 -> It's based on points as well,each kill grants points -> Duration is set through a configuration,but i think it's 5 minutes by default - team that has most points at the end wins.​
9. Capture the Emblem (dunno if we will call it like that) - 3 teams that capture each other's emblem from their base and kill each other to gather points for their teams - Team that has more points at the end wins​
10. Guild vs Guild - Monsters spawn during this PvP - each monster grants 1 point for the team / player killing grants 2 points for the team -> Guild that has most points at the end wins​
​----------------------------------------------------------SECURITY
1. Player tracker - we can track every player's messages,actions inside the game such as logins,trades,mails,skill executes,inventory items,IP,HWID etc
2. Cooldown protection - we have a server sided cooldown protection,so even if someone attempts to use a client side skill cooldown change,server side won't allow you to execute the skill.​
3. Anti-Afk - if you activate bots or anything,certain areas will have an anti-afk check message every x amount of time and if you don't click the required keyboard key,you'll be teleported/kicked.​
4. Overground/Underground protection - you are being checked constantly for overground and underground by our server,so you'll be teleported/kicked whenever you attempt doing anything related.​
5. Packet spam protection - you cannot spam any system in the game,such as login,enhancement,mail system,chat or anything related.
6. Speed hack protection - attempting to speed hack will result in a kick from the client. We have a check for it.​
7. Rollback protection - your character information is being saved every x seconds into our database,so you cannot lose any items or anything related.​
8. Max damage protection - you cannot attempt to damage hack or anything related,because there is a protection on maximum damage you can have/do.​",36.0,5,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Game</h3>
<p>Every card is hand drawn and the characters are created by our own. Borislav Grigorov ""Sten Duc"" will draw each card and he deserves to be credited extra. The game rules are pretty simple so there is not a steep learning curve, everyone can play it. It is actually a strategy game. You have to think of the best combo to defeat your opponents.</p>
<p>The rules are totally new, created by us. We have played it many times with scetches and the fun is proven. One game takes about 30 minutes. But you'll experience games of 10 minutes or 3-4 hours. It is depending on each players strategy.</p>
<p>The 1-1 (2 player) experience is different than the 3-4 player experience. At 1-1 your strategy is more about defeating your opponent. At a 4 players game the common strategy is turning into not to be defeated. Wait... isn't this the rule of life? Anyway, a well explained rule card will be in the set.</p>

</h3>I started saving up to buy a new PC about 4 years ago and got one finally last year at christmas. It worked great and I met a bunch of awesome people online who I played regurarly with and just virtually hung out with. I felt a part of a community and met so many good people. Everything was great and then this year it broke and the warranty wasn't covering it. I hoped to just buy a new part, but the motherboard was all fried :(. Now I'm stuck trying to get a new one, but haven't got the money and I will have to save up a lot to get a new one. It just made my life take a turn for the worse and I feel that maybe there are good samaritans out there who can understand my plight. It just felt like such a punch in the gut after saving up money for so long.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I need and what I can offer as a thank you.<br/>
</h3>I have a friend who promised to help me build a desktop gaming PC for free from scratch if I can get the parts. I feel, that if I'm to build one, I want it to be one that lasts a long time. I don't like wasting money on something that will quickly go out-of-date. So I need to somehow get the money to buy all I need. I won't be able to offer much of material value in return to the donators, but I will offer my sincerest gratitude, humble appreciation and, as a token of this, for each person donating €10+ I will draw, to the best of my abilities, a picture of any theme they choose. I want to make a monster of a gaming PC to make the most of any contributions I recieve. I hope you will enjoy what I can offer you and help me get my life back :3<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>I am currently stuck mostly using computers at libraries and borrowing an old laptop from my dad to be able to go online, but it's difficult to do work for university and stay up to date with news and friends. Also, most of my friends are abroad and it was our way of hanging out to play games online and talk, which I can't do now. I feel like a big part of my life has been ripped out and I'm aching to get it back. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Updates and Obstacles<br/>
</h3>I will regurarly post here updates to my situation and if I get close to my goal I will post how much much of a difference to my life you are making, if there's any obstacle that appears, you will know! <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't offer money, then recommendations and expertise will be very appreciated too. If you perhaps have really good parts you don't need anymore. Any moral support can also feel helpful :)<br/>

I won't be able to offer much of material value in return to the donators, but I will offer my sincerest gratitude, humble appreciation and, as a token of this, for each person donating €10+ I will draw, to the best of my abilities, a picture of any theme they choose. I want to make a monster of a gaming PC to make the most of any contributions I recieve. I hope you will enjoy what I can offer you and help me get my life back :3
  The ImpactI am currently stuck mostly using computers at libraries and borrowing an old laptop from my dad to be able to go online, but it's difficult to do work for university and stay up to date with news and friends. Also, most of my friends are abroad and it was our way of hanging out to play games online and talk, which I can't do now. I feel like a big part of my life has been ripped out and I'm aching to get it back. 
  Updates and Obstacles
I will regurarly post here updates to my situation and if I get close to my goal I will post how much much of a difference to my life you are making, if there's any obstacle that appears, you will know! 
  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't offer money, then recommendations and expertise will be very appreciated too. If you perhaps have really good parts you don't need anymore. Any moral support can also feel helpful :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>Творческая группа Барба представляет коллекционную карточную игру про темный умирающий мир, где все встало на свои места, где деньги и сомнительные навыки иллюзорного мира не значат ничего, а настоящее мастерство позволяет выжить. Это игра, создающая невероятный накал, цепко удерживающий игроков в постоянном напряжении. Это игра-погружение, где за каждой картой с авторскими иллюстрациями стоит маленькая история, переносящая игрока из теплой уютной комнаты прямиком в ледяной враждебный мир. Это фантазия про то, во что превратятся обыкновенные люди после наступления апокалипсиса. В этой игре нет компромиссов и лжи, зато есть настоящая стратегия и тактика. В этой игре нет снисхождения и жалости, здесь просто надо выжить, уничтожив любого, кто встанет на твоем пути.</p>
<p>Говорят, что конец света наступил из-за того, что насекомые отрастили перламутровые хоботы в виде мясорубок и начали перемалывать окружающую материю. Сейчас важно лишь то, что жалкие остатки человечества из последних сил борются за последние ресурсы. В разрушенном мире живется несладко — нет горячей воды, телесериалов и сметанных пончиков, зато есть ржавые серпы, заточенные гвозди и гнилые крысы, которые помогают выживать не хуже пончиков. Здесь сталкиваются сила и хитрость, а мастерство трещит под напором численного преимущества.</p>
<p>Сегодня ты стал частью неумолимой силы, расползающейся из глубоких шахт и несущей в мозолистых ладонях страх, предсмертную агонию и отбойные молотки. Тебе плевать на ложные ценности умирающего мира, в твоих жилах струится коктейль из крови и радиоактивной слизи. Ты возглавил пищевую цепь и взираешь с брезгливой улыбкой на возню оставшихся людей, для тебя все окружающие — еда или инструмент добычи еды.</p>
<p>Набирай новых участников группы сообразно выбранной стратегии. Оценивай силы противника и подбирай наиболее разрушительные сочетания атакующих групп. Уделяй особое внимание персонажам со специальными навыками, даже самые слабые из них способны изменить расклад сил. Ищи предметы и собирай радиоактивную слизь, которой можно заражать бойцов, получая нужное сочетание боевых характеристик. Береги шахтеров до последнего момента, лишь они способны вселять в противников животный страх и рассекать вражеские ряды подобно волнорезам.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Особенности</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Оригинальный интуитивный геймплей, сочетающий механику классической настольной и коллекционной карточной игры</p></li>

<p>Радиоактивная слизь — странный и опасный ресурс, обнаруженный в шахтах сразу после конца света. Строго говоря, слизь не ресурс, а новая форма разумной жизни.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Улучшения</h2>
<p>Боевые характеристики персонажей и оружия могут быть изменены с помощью найденных предметов или слизи.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Геймплей</h2>
<p>Игра начинается с того, что один из игроков выкладывает на поле боя от двух до четырех карт персонажей, то же самое делает соперник. Следующий ход делает игрок, выложивший свои карты первым. Он может атаковать соперника персонажем, оружием или слизью либо в счет хода вывести на поле нового персонажа.</p>
<p>Игрок, который не может совершить очередной ход и не может нанять в свою группу новых бойцов, выбывает из игры. Игрок, в группе которого не осталось ни одного шахтера, также терпит поражение. Победивший игрок ходит первым в новом коне.</p>
<br/><p>Перед первым ходом нового кона игроки могут использовать полученное мясо для найма новых бойцов и для покупки оружия. Также, пока не начался новый кон, игроки могут принести в жертву любое количество своих персонажей и получить соответствующее количество мяса в банке.</p>

*** RUSSIAN ***************************************************************


Творческая группа Барба представляет коллекционную карточную игру про темный умирающий мир, где все встало на свои места, где деньги и сомнительные навыки иллюзорного мира не значат ничего, а настоящее мастерство позволяет выжить. Это игра, создающая невероятный накал, цепко удерживающий игроков в постоянном напряжении. Это игра-погружение, где за каждой картой с авторскими иллюстрациями стоит маленькая история, переносящая игрока из теплой уютной комнаты прямиком в ледяной враждебный мир. Это фантазия про то, во что превратятся обыкновенные люди после наступления апокалипсиса. В этой игре нет компромиссов и лжи, зато есть настоящая стратегия и тактика. В этой игре нет снисхождения и жалости, здесь просто надо выжить, уничтожив любого, кто встанет на твоем пути.
Говорят, что конец света наступил из-за того, что насекомые отрастили перламутровые хоботы в виде мясорубок и начали перемалывать окружающую материю. Сейчас важно лишь то, что жалкие остатки человечества из последних сил борются за последние ресурсы. В разрушенном мире живется несладко — нет горячей воды, телесериалов и сметанных пончиков, зато есть ржавые серпы, заточенные гвозди и гнилые крысы, которые помогают выживать не хуже пончиков. Здесь сталкиваются сила и хитрость, а мастерство трещит под напором численного преимущества.
Сегодня ты стал частью неумолимой силы, расползающейся из глубоких шахт и несущей в мозолистых ладонях страх, предсмертную агонию и отбойные молотки. Тебе плевать на ложные ценности умирающего мира, в твоих жилах струится коктейль из крови и радиоактивной слизи. Ты возглавил пищевую цепь и взираешь с брезгливой улыбкой на возню оставшихся людей, для тебя все окружающие — еда или инструмент добычи еды.
Набирай новых участников группы сообразно выбранной стратегии. Оценивай силы противника и подбирай наиболее разрушительные сочетания атакующих групп. Уделяй особое внимание персонажам со специальными навыками, даже самые слабые из них способны изменить расклад сил. Ищи предметы и собирай радиоактивную слизь, которой можно заражать бойцов, получая нужное сочетание боевых характеристик. Береги шахтеров до последнего момента, лишь они способны вселять в противников животный страх и рассекать вражеские ряды подобно волнорезам.
Особенности

Оригинальный интуитивный геймплей, сочетающий механику классической настольной и коллекционной карточной игры
Экстремально быстрые (10-20 минут) и долгие партии (1.5-2 часа)
Множество комбинаций карт персонажей, предметов, оружия и радиоактивной слизи
Абсолютная непредсказуемость развязки и сотни тактических схем
Возможность регулирования сложности игрового процесса
В игре может участвовать от двух до шести игроков с возможностью создания альянсов.
Игра продолжается до тех пор, пока у всех, кроме одного игрока, не закончатся карты персонажей. Или до того момента, когда шахтеры всех игроков, кроме одного, не будут выведены из игры.
Три вида атаки (персонажем, оружием, радиоактивной слизью)
Размер карт — 70х105 мм

Ресурсы
Мясо — важнейший ресурс в этом жестоком мире. С помощью мяса шахтеры нанимают в свои группы людей, переживших апокалипсис, и покупают оружие.
Радиоактивная слизь — странный и опасный ресурс, обнаруженный в шахтах сразу после конца света. Строго говоря, слизь не ресурс, а новая форма разумной жизни.

Улучшения
Боевые характеристики персонажей и оружия могут быть изменены с помощью найденных предметов или слизи.

Геймплей
Игра начинается с того, что один из игроков выкладывает на поле боя от двух до четырех карт персонажей, то же самое делает соперник. Следующий ход делает игрок, выложивший свои карты первым. Он может атаковать соперника персонажем, оружием или слизью либо в счет хода вывести на поле нового персонажа.
Игрок, который не может совершить очередной ход и не может нанять в свою группу новых бойцов, выбывает из игры. Игрок, в группе которого не осталось ни одного шахтера, также терпит поражение. Победивший игрок ходит первым в новом коне.
Перед первым ходом нового кона игроки могут использовать полученное мясо для найма новых бойцов и для покупки оружия. Также, пока не начался новый кон, игроки могут принести в жертву любое количество своих персонажей и получить соответствующее количество мяса в банке.

В коробке

120 карт в стартовой колоде;
6 карт бесчеловечных шахтеров, зараженных радиоактивной слизью, которые поведут ваших изможденных новобранцев в бой;
31 уникальная карта персонажей, среди которых можно встретить простых менеджеров, дизайнеров, актеров, врачей и проституток;
Карты ловцов, которые могут похищать вражеских персонажей;

Hi, my name
is Cláudio Serpa and I'm the principal volunteer Pokémon VGC organizer in
Portugal.
This past
year I’ve been trying to establish Pokémon VGC in Portugal, introduce Portugal
players in the international community and try to get the world to know our
players.
This has
proven to be a difficult task!
But now a
new season is coming and we’re doing our all to correct our past mistakes and
start new projects.
One of
those projects is to get a better visualization of our tournaments.
So
basically we want to start streaming and recording every tournament we can.
This will
help us getting more visualization within our country so we can captivate more
players and will also allow us to share the evolution of Portugal in the VGC
along this year with the rest of the World.In
case we don’t have an internet connection strong enough to stream we will be able to at
least record and save the tournaments battles to upload them in our youtube
page (https://www.youtube.com/user/PKMNBattleLeaguePT) in case we can get to our goal.  Right now we're using a wood support with a web cam to try and record the battles. The problems are that the support for the Nintendo 3ds only allows a normal one to fit, so every player with a 3ds XL can't be recorded and the quality is very poor!  What We Need & What You Get 
In more
detail:


We
need around 510 Euros to get a console with a capture card. If we reach
1021 Euros we will buy a second capture card so we can have one in each of our
principal regions.


We’ll
also use the capture card to assist us recording tutorial videos to help our beginning
players get started!

In
case we don’t get enough founds depending on the value achieved we may try to
get the amount missing to buy the capture card from other methods or we may use
the money to try and finance a paid trip to 1 national for 1 player in the end
of the season.

We will leave here the link to the photos of some events we've organized in the past https://www.facebook.com/PokemonBattleLeague/ph... 

   The Impact 
This can
help immensely in the growth of our Pokémon VGC community!

Help us
improve the conditions of our tournaments!

Sam Cole, and How All This Started

</b></div><p>
</p><p>Sam recently retired from a long career in corporate
marketing and ten years working part time coordinating volunteers and
orchestrating hundreds of adult education classes. </p>
<p>He lives in Clackamas, Oregon, a suburb of Portland.
</p>Sam says: 

<p>Last January I
was sipping wine in my man-cave trying to figure out what to do with hundreds
of wine corks I had collected. </p>
<p>Some wood dowels were rolling around
on the floor. As I picked up a few I tried to poke them into some wine
corks. I was figuring I could make “artistic-looking” picture frames for sale
at craft fairs. Poking wasn’t working so I drilled holes in the corks and
pushed the dowels into the corks. Each new “picture frame” was as ugly as the
last “picture frame.”</p>
<p>Out of frustration and having sipped a little more wine, I drilled more holes in more corks. I found more dowels. I kept
fooling around building cork ’n dowel structures. </p>
<p>Next, I wondered, “How HIGH can I build this corks ’n
dowels thing?” As I kept building. I hardly noticed the fun I was having. </p>
<p>As my contraption grew higher, and wobbled all over,
a challenge presented itself: “Can I make this thing BALANCE?” Soon, that
challenge became: “Can I make this thing balance on just one of its corks?!” </p>
<p>I’m confident that that was the moment when the
essence of “Uncle Corky” was born. </p>
<p>Since then I’ve fine-tuned the set
and market-tested it with hundreds of kids and adults in game stores here in Portland, Oregon. It’s a hoot!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441504377/n4q6ih7pvtkhuifj5arj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441504443/mijhj81pl92dxvp0iehc.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/><p align=""center""><a href=""http://imgur.com/w34VJsE"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></a><a href=""http://imgur.com/w34VJsE"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></a><a href=""http://imgur.com/w34VJsE"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></a><b>The Uncle Corky Brand is Unique </b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>All
our puzzle games are custom-made, handcrafted. No plastics. No electronics.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We
repurpose used natural cork wine stoppers. We collect, sort, Borax-clean, drill,
and paint them. Then we assemble the different types of corks in the proper
combinations and box them for merchandising and
shipping. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>All
     our corks and dowels (“sticks”), in all colors, are sealed with
     lab-tested, certified, non-toxic, non-allergic paints from ECOS Paints: <a href=""http://www.ecospaints.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ecospaints.net</a><span>  This coating makes them safe and
     long-lasting.</span>
</li>
<li>All
     our brand’s puzzle/game rules are original. Plus, we will encourage more
     and more “spin-offs” or really creative “House Rules” to quickly emerge as
     players keep having fun doing their own thing. My blog will be one area
     for these posts. YouTube will be another. <br/>
</li>
<li>We
     will be a quality yet inexpensive brand, compared to other tabletop game
     companies.</li>
<li>We
     will continue to give attention to the unique biodiversity of
     the cork forests around the Mediterranean basin and the families who
     harvest this unique bark. They produce enough cork to supply wineries for
     100+ years but they must be protected.</li>

</span></span>Average balance time for more experienced
players: 12 – 14 minutes, with exceptional players “off the charts” in the five
minute range</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Set up time: none, unless the player
chooses to organize their 30-pieces. </p>
<p><span>·<span>

</span></span>Merchandising: Game sets are boxed and
available in five different colors to keep each player’s pieces unto

(She was really skilled at building and drew the best card immediately<span>.)  </span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Rules: The player chooses their best
base piece and interconnects their first four pieces. Each move thereafter to
build, then balance, their 30-piece structure is dictated by drawing a card
from the game’s custom 24-card deck. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Several “nasty” cards halt progress.
Several complex cards require thought and calculation. Several cards allow
certain minutes of “free build time.” One card, highly valued by tournament
players, allows a 6-minute free-build time. Players can influence but not
control the game’s outcome, no matter how skilled they are. </p>

multi-generational families who harvest them. Very cool.<br/></p>
<p align=""center""><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>Q: “Uncle Corky! Sometimes you pull wine corks out

<p>UC: “You’re right. Some of them have gone to the
dark (or grayish green) side.<span>  All Uncle
Corky corks get a “long drowning” in Borax</span>®.</p>
<p>Q: “Uncle Corky! Uncle Corky! The sticks! A player
could poke their eye out! The corks! A kid or a drunk could choke on a wine
cork!”</p>
<p>UC: We use the iconic, bright yellow CHOKING HAZARD
warning icon on all our instruction sheets and packaging.<span>  And the common “Not for Children Under 5”
text.  Also, I'm approved for product liability
insurance. Have you played <i>Pick Up Sticks</i> recently?</span></p>
<p>Q: “Uncle Corky! The paint on those corks! Will it
harm my child?” </p>

Sam Cole, and How All This Started


Sam recently retired from a long career in corporate
marketing and ten years working part time coordinating volunteers and
orchestrating hundreds of adult education classes. 
He lives in Clackamas, Oregon, a suburb of Portland.
Sam says: 

Last January I
was sipping wine in my man-cave trying to figure out what to do with hundreds
of wine corks I had collected. 
Some wood dowels were rolling around
on the floor. As I picked up a few I tried to poke them into some wine
corks. I was figuring I could make “artistic-looking” picture frames for sale
at craft fairs. Poking wasn’t working so I drilled holes in the corks and
pushed the dowels into the corks. Each new “picture frame” was as ugly as the
last “picture frame.”
Out of frustration and having sipped a little more wine, I drilled more holes in more corks. I found more dowels. I kept
fooling around building cork ’n dowel structures. 
Next, I wondered, “How HIGH can I build this corks ’n
dowels thing?” As I kept building. I hardly noticed the fun I was having. 
As my contraption grew higher, and wobbled all over,
a challenge presented itself: “Can I make this thing BALANCE?” Soon, that
challenge became: “Can I make this thing balance on just one of its corks?!” 
I’m confident that that was the moment when the
essence of “Uncle Corky” was born. 
Since then I’ve fine-tuned the set
and market-tested it with hundreds of kids and adults in game stores here in Portland, Oregon. It’s a hoot!The Uncle Corky Brand is Unique 
· 
All
our puzzle games are custom-made, handcrafted. No plastics. No electronics.
· 
We
repurpose used natural cork wine stoppers. We collect, sort, Borax-clean, drill,
and paint them. Then we assemble the different types of corks in the proper
combinations and box them for merchandising and
shipping. 


All
     our corks and dowels (“sticks”), in all colors, are sealed with
     lab-tested, certified, non-toxic, non-allergic paints from ECOS Paints: www.ecospaints.net  This coating makes them safe and
     long-lasting.

All
     our brand’s puzzle/game rules are original. Plus, we will encourage more
     and more “spin-offs” or really creative “House Rules” to quickly emerge as
     players keep having fun doing their own thing. My blog will be one area
     for these posts. YouTube will be another. 

We
     will be a quality yet inexpensive brand, compared to other tabletop game
     companies.
We
     will continue to give attention to the unique biodiversity of
     the cork forests around the Mediterranean basin and the families who
     harvest this unique bark. They produce enough cork to supply wineries for
     100+ years but they must be protected.

minute range
· 
Set up time: none, unless the player
chooses to organize their 30-pieces. 
· 
Rules: The player inter-connects 20
specially drilled wine corks with 10 wooden sticks, builds a unique structure
that holds together and must balance on just one of its corks for at least 60
seconds. 
· 
Merchandising: Game sets are boxed and
available in five different colors to keep each player’s pieces unto

A-Flyin’
  This is an extension of puzzle/game
described above, The Good time Challenge
· 
$22.00

(She was really skilled at building and drew the best card immediately.)  
· 
Rules: The player chooses their best
base piece and interconnects their first four pieces. Each move thereafter to
build, then balance, their 30-piece structure is dictated by drawing a card
from the game’s custom 24-card deck. 
· 
Several “nasty” cards halt progress.
Several complex cards require thought and calculation. Several cards allow
certain minutes of “free build time.” One card, highly valued by tournament
players, allows a 6-minute free-build time. Players can influence but not
control the game’s outcome, no matter how skilled they are. 
· 
Merchandising: game sets are available
in five different colors to keep each player’s pieces unto themselves.

Risks and Challenges
Q: “Uncle Corky! Sometimes you pull wine corks out
of the garbage! Aren’t they dirty? Don’t they have mold on them? Yuck!”
UC: “You’re right. Some of them have gone to the
dark (or grayish green) side.  All Uncle
Corky corks get a “long drowning” in Borax®.
Q: “Uncle Corky! Uncle Corky! The sticks! A player
could poke their eye out! The corks! A kid or a drunk could choke on a wine
cork!”
UC: We use the iconic, bright yellow CHOKING HAZARD
warning icon on all our instruction sheets and packaging.  And the common “Not for Children Under 5”
text.  Also, I'm approved for product liability
insurance. Have you played Pick Up Sticks recently?
Q: “Uncle Corky! The paint on those corks! Will it
harm my child?” 
UC: “We use, exclusively, the high gloss paints and
clear sealer/varnish from ECOS Paints. Check out their products, lab test

<p>A time when teamwork, friendship and community meant more than ""everyman"" games chock-full of single-serving, on-the-rails questlines designed to take you to max level in a matter of days in such a way that you never have to interact with another player to achieve the ""end game"". </p>
<p>No mini-maps. No quest hubs. <a href=""http://sagaoflucimia.com/topic/what-does-no-solo-content-mean/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zero solo content</a>. 3-4 man overland content, 8-man dungeons, and multi-group raids. No flashing icons over the heads of NPCs telling you who to talk to or where to go, no glowing trails leading you from quest objective to quest objective. </p>
<p>Languages, factions, ruins, cities, dungeons, and more. A massive world to explore, and a classless, skill-based game where you create your own story with your friends and allies. </p>
<p>Explore emergent gameplay in a world where the players determine the hot spots, the best places to hunt, their favorite dungeons, routes to and from cities, camp spots, and beyond. With zero single-player storylines guiding you or funneling you from Point A to Point B. <b>Sandbox, not themepark. </b><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>The Fellowship of the Ring was not just one character. Jason had his Argonauts. Zeus went up against The Titans alongside The Olympians. History and mythology is full of examples of epic battles waged in the battle of good versus evil…and none of them are fought single-handed.</p>
<p>Modern-day television enraptures this essence as well, with shows like Firefly, Lost, and The Walking Dead all showcasing a team of players facing up against the odds. And we’ve seen it over the years as well; Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica (<em>both the original and re-imagined</em>), Stargate and beyond.</p>
<p>The greatest adventures are undertaken by groups. The greatest challenges can only be overcome with allies. The greatest rewards come from deeds performed alongside your peers. Dragons aren’t slain by lone heroes; it takes a team of well-oiled champions battling together to bring it down…and then share in the spoils of war together.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>If you grew up on Dungeons and Dragons, Ultima Online, EverQuest, and Vanilla World of Warcraft, than you know exactly what we are creating: a group-based game where the only way to move forward is by making strategic progression with allies by your side. </b></p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Get back to basics with a challenge-based MMORPG focusing on epic adventure the moment you step outside the safety of the city walls. </p>
<p>This is more than just a game. Ours is a living, breathing world with a <a href=""http://sagaoflucimia.com/the-story-so-far"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rich, deep texture of history and lore</a>, where danger lurks around every corner and adventure awaits the moment you step out of any door.</p>
<p>Magic is non-existent at this point of the world, which is <a href=""http://sagaoflucimia.com/game/lore"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">where Volume I picks up</a>, 500 years after the Archemage Chaldeon took the Book of Knowledge into hiding, deeming mankind unfit to handle the responsibility that came with having access to great power. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, all that is left behind are the architectural masterpieces the Elder Races once created, as well as dungeons, scrolls, relics and books that the Scholar’s Guild protects at all costs in a vain attempt to retain as much mastery over their once-great power as possible. Over time, however, their ability to control the relics, decipher the runes and texts and tap into the once-powerful magic, is fading.</p>
<p>You are born into a world where magic is nothing more than a distant memory. Mankind gets things done with the sweat of their brow and with their own two hands. Master Scholars are able to augment the day-to-day aspects of living with various relics, and adventurers with the relevant understanding of runes, lore and the ancient texts can tap into the hidden power of armor and weapons, but the days of Adepts and magic and spells and Elder races are nothing more than myths and legends shown in ancient paintings and faded scrolls and books and stumbled across in long-forgotten dungeons.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What Is Challenge?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you make the decision to leave the safety of town and its guards, it’s not a decision you should be making lightly. You need to prepare for an adventure that will take multiple game sessions to complete. </p>
<p>Zones will take hours to multiple game sessions to cross, depending on if you stay on the path or head off into unmarked territory. Dungeons will take weeks to months to complete. Ours is not a game to be played in five minute chunks of time. Ours is a world where you invest yourself just as much as in the real world, and meet up with your friends, family, and allies for scheduled game sessions, just like a D&amp;D campaign around the coffee table. </p>
<p>You need a balanced group of adventurers to handle whatever you might come across in the wild. You need gear. You need supplies. Bandages. Potions. Scrolls. A pack mule and mounts. Wagons. Extra leather, wood, steel, sharpening stones, tools, and rope. Never leave home without a good length of rope.</p>
<p><b>It’s an excursion, not an afternoon stroll down to the river to pick daffodils for your sweetheart or mum.</b></p>
<p>Think the Mines of Moria; we want every dungeon and adventure our players encounter to be on par with what The Fellowship encountered while being forced to skip the pass and head into the mines.</p>
<p>That being said, we understand the limitations of Real Life. Sometimes you can't commit to lengthy gaming sessions day in and day out. You've got a job, spouse, kids, other hobbies, and other commitments. That's what mechanics such as our <a href=""http://sagaoflucimia.com/topic/camps-caravans-a-detailed-look/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Camps &amp; Caravans system </a>are being designed for.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we're adding other mechanics to up the ante. For example, there won't be mini-maps in this game. You'll be navigating based on your own ability to figure out where you are in the world or a given zone. You'll be able to find maps for cities that you can store in your inventory and open up to help you navigate the streets, but there won't be a glowing dot with a ""You Are Here"" marker; you'll still need to be able to read the map and figure out where you are in the city.</p>
<p>There will also be NPC-dropped maps that are part of quest chains, as well as those given to you by NPCs as part of quests, but those won't be linked to a mini-map. Instead, it will be based on your ability to read the map in real-time and navigate the world using descriptions and landmarks in conjunction with those maps...if any exist in the first place for whatever it is you are looking for.</p>
<p>And yes, there will be corpse runs; if you die in the wild, your gear will remain on your corpse and it will be up to you (and your friends) to work your way back to where your corpse remains to recover your gear and continue your adventure.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Game</h3>
<p>The Saga of Lucimia MMORPG is a group-based, classless game where there are no levels. Instead, we are using a skill-based character system where you can create whatever type of Player Character you want. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Your selection of skills defines your playstyle and your class. Upon character creation you have the option to choose which skills will define your character during your time in the unfolding saga, customizing your character based upon your own unique combination of skills.</p>
<p>The content of the world can only be overcome by balanced groups of Player Characters leveraging a wide array of skills throughout the Archetypes. The challenges you face are not merely combat-based. Mechanical and magical traps, locks, doorways, and more abound in our world, and if you lack the skills to detect/unlock/overcome those challenges, your progress will come to a halt. </p>
<p>Dungeons have entire sections dedicated to mechanical traps and doorways that can only be overcome by player with Thief abilities. Other sections are locked away behind magical doorways and rune traps that only a trained Scholar can bypass or detect. If you walk into a dungeon with purely Adventurer Archetypes, you may very well pass by entire wings without even knowing they exist. Or walk into a cavern in the middle of the mountains and never even detect the dungeon entrance in the first place.</p>
<p>Or pass by that tunnel that rises above you and never know that there is an entire wing above the party, because your characters lack climbing skills or tools, and because no one was paying attention and only looking forward. </p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>While you can create a character from scratch and choose your own skills to start, there is also a list of pre-designed Archetype builds that most long-term gamers and table-top players will be familiar with, such as Monk, Ranger, Thief, Bard and beyond. These builds have pre-selected skill combinations that best define them based upon lore and the type of character they represent. There are also sub-builds, such as the Archer version of the Warrior, or the Assassin version of the Thief.</p>
<p>In addition, these pre-built Archetypes have special advanced abilities assigned to them. Such as a Ranger build having Advanced Tracking. While a player just starting out can choose Tracking at the beginner level, if they want to work their way up to Advanced Tracking they first need to level up their skill...but beyond that, they also have to find the trainer who can teach them the Advanced version of that skill. </p>
<p><b>The vast majority of Avanced Trainers are not found in the major cities. Instead, they are out in the world, in the backwater outposts, front lines, caverns, ruins, mountains, forests, canyons, and wilds of the game. Our internal estimation is that roughly 85% of the advanced abilities you can learn in the game will be found outside of the major cities. </b></p>
<p>The only way to find these trainers is to have a group capable of exploring the wilds and uncovering them in the first place. And also hoping that you have the prerequisite skills, statistics, faction, and beyond to train with them in the first place. </p>
<p>Advancement is the result of hard work, given out for achievement, not simply for existing. If you want six-pack abs you have to be prepared to spend a few hours per day in the gym, as well as elminate the garbage from your diet. <b>You don't get ripped by sitting on your ass all day long. </b></p>
<p>All characters can be broken down into two Archetypes that you select at the start of your saga. </p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Adventurer</h4>
<p>The Adventurer Archetype is someone who is comfortable making a living by the skill of their martial abilities, by the sweat of their brow, and by the strength of their arm. They are comfortable in city, world and dungeon environments, and make up the backbone of any adventuring party making its way out beyond the safety of a city or outpost.</p>
<p>Examples of Adventurer Archetypes are Warriors, Thieves, Rangers, Bards, Monks, etc.</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Scholar</h4>
<p>The Scholar Archetype is someone who is more comfortable making a living with their scholarly abilities, through countless hours of study and research into ancient texts, runes, hieroglyphs and the various relics left behind from The Great War and the years when magic was still a part of the world and the Adepts still roamed the land keeping peace and aiding those in need.</p>
<p>Scholarly Archetypes are able to manipulate relics left behind from before the Great War, activating powers on items through the translation of those very same texts, runes, hieroglyphs and symbols. Scrolls, weapons, armor, old tomes, wands, statues, all fall under the review of a scholar's studious ways.</p>
<p>Scholars provide a support role within groups and are vital components to the ensured survival of a party. They can fill either heal/cure-based roles, utility slots, or damage-dealing roles based upon gear and skill selections.</p>
<p>The scholar's ability to translate ancient texts, languages and symbols also gives them a unique advantage in dungeon settings where certain areas of dungeons will remain forever hidden unless you have a scholar with the relevant skills in your party who can decipher texts to unseal ancient doors locked for centuries, sarcophagi holding the relics of the dead for countless millennia,  and to uncover other hidden mysteries, such as how to trigger an ancient well of resurrection or teleportation....</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">Combat, Survival, and The World Outside of Cities</span></p>
<div>The Saga of Lucimia is a game where tactical combat is the only way to move forward. There is zero tank-and-spank, face-roll-on-the-keyboard-to-win content in our game. Instead, we are going back to the basics where crowd control, mob placement, and strategic combat win the day. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Utility is the key to every group, especially in the depths of a dungeon. And since magic is non-existent during Volume I, there are no clerics or characters who can heal or cast spells during combat. The only way to do so is through the use of relics.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Which means there are no in-combat spells or heals outside of those relics which allow for such spells to be cast. Players who have achieved such relics through quests and exploration of the world will be highly sought-after in groups. The same goes for Scholars and Adventurers who have come across magic weapons and armor which allow them to transcend the mundane. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Which also means combat is extremely tactical. With no in-combat heals, every hitpoint counts. Especially since we are using a D&amp;D-style of stats + hitpoints where there is zero bloat. You won't see players with 10k hitpoints in our world; instead, you'll see a standard 20 - 40 to start with, and 150-300 at the end-game via the use of relic items and sets of gear.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Which means it is very much a reality to find yourself getting one-shotted if you are a squishy character who doesn't pay attention to where you are standing during combat, or you have a ""bad tank"" who doesn't place mobs properly. And no, there won't be flashy red glowing AOE reticles painted on the ground showing you where mob abilities are going to land. You'll have to figure that out through good old fashioned trial and error.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1312629/files/20150321045004-Pre_Alpha.jpg?1426938604"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>Strategizing your pulls and ensuring that you have plenty of crowd control is vital to your group's survival. On top of that, you'll need to be able to lock down any fleeing mobs, plus control the placement of the mobs during each encounter to ensure that mobs stay focused on the tanks and not wailing on the support classes who have limited mitigation and armor class, as well as fewer hitpoints. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Relics can also be game-changing items. For example, teleportation in the Saga of Lucimia does not exist, at least not as a spell during Volume I. A player who has a transportation relic can literally become one of the most powerful players in the game world on his or her server, because he can suddenly travel instantly across great distances. Imagine a guild with a player who can transport raid groups across the world in an instant, while the rest of the players rely on the limited fast-travel options scattered between outposts and cities. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Healing will largely take place within Encampments via the use of bandages, potions, and good old fashioned regeneration... unless players have relics which can afford them healing. Every group has the ability to set up a Camp during their adventures. These act as waypoints for the group during their adventures outside of the major cities and outposts, and it is here that you can set up a campfire, apply bandages, mend wounds, regenerate your hitpoints, repair your armor, cook food, and beyond. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There are skills and abilities related to Encampments. Scholars will be able to place wards and traps depending on their ablities/relics, as well as Thief-Archetypes, or Ranger-Archetypes. This will help ward off danger during downtime when you are healing up and mending armor/weapons. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There are no City Recall abilities in our game, and fast travel options are extremely limited outside of city-to-city or outpost-to-city options (none of which are completely safe; random encounters absolutely exist in our game). Encampments play a vital role in the survival of your group because they act as your group's headquarters during your time out in the field away from the outposts and cities.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Someone has to leave for the night? Emergency room because someone's kid fell and broke their arm, or there's a school play, or work, or movie night with the spouse? They'll be logging back in to the Caravan waypoint the next session. Group needs to break for the weekend? You'll want to set up an Encampment and place your wards/etc. while you log out. <a href=""http://sagaoflucimia.com/topic/camps-caravans-a-detailed-look/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">More on the Camps &amp; Carvans system here.</a>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>When you set out on a campaign, you'll be heading out in a Caravan, which consists of a wagon or two of supplies, plus pack mules and horses. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Which, by the way, can be killed. And the only way to get new mounts is to either have a Train Animal ability, or find another player who can train animals and also knows where to find them, or breeds them to sell to other players in the first place. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>Defending your Caravan on the way to the dungeon, not to mention during your adventures, as well as on the way back to the city with all of your hard-earned spoils, is part of the experience. Just as much as you want to haul your well-earned spoils back to town, there are bandits and other dangers in the wilds which will be waiting to take those spoils from you if you aren't strong enough to defend yourselves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Encampment + Caravan are vital to your survival in the wild. It is important to have a well-balanced group who can defend, as well as restock and repair the Caravan in between outposts and cities. Skills such as carpentry, leatherworking, armorsmithing, skinning, cooking, and beyond are required for survival in the wilds. If you are three weeks into the depths of a dungeon, you'll need someone along who can repair your armor, mend the broken axle on the wagon, make new potions and food, and tend to the wounds of both players and mounts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Since you can't simply recall back to a city every hour or so via the use of an ability, the only way to repair armor or restock your supplies while out on a campaign is either via your own skills or those of your allies. <b>The only way to survive is by working together as a team. </b>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>Gear plays a major role in your ability to survive, as do your character abilities. Relic armor and weapons and gear allow you to transcend mere human strength, dexterity, speed and abilities, and the only way to aquire relic gear is through exploration into the depths of ancient ruins and dungeons, which in turn requires a group for you to conquer. <b>The only way to achieve is by working together as a team.</b>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>Community, and your ability to work together and play well with others, is the only way to move forward in The Saga of Lucimia. </b>From the game forums, to the taverns and cities and outposts, to the in-game chat channels, to guilds and static groups, everything is about community and your ability to work within a team. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What Are We Here For</h3>
<div>If you've been following us for the past year since we started this journey back in March of 2014, you know that we've been dedicated to building this game in our spare time outside of our day jobs. We've assembled 12 team members since that time, and we've come a long way. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We've been 100% transparent with our followers along the way, and have talked about our opinions on the current state of crowdfunding on a few different occassions, such as <a href=""http://sagaoflucimia.com/crowdfunding-101-transparency/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in this blog post </a>and during the Twitch chat video below with producers Tim Anderson and Giovanni Martello.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DUU-Ho8IAYuUbwwvgKMxwdT_w&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsMIhrXjpy6E%26list%3DUU-Ho8IAYuUbwwvgKMxwdT_w&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FsMIhrXjpy6E%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div></div>
<div>
<p>Rather than rely on other people, we are funding this game out of our own pockets. We aren’t here on Indiegogo because we need your money. We are doing it because our community voted and asked us to. There are a lot of people out there (far more than we ever anticipated!) who actually WANT to help us fund this game, which has completely blown our minds!</p>
<p>Your support has been overwhelming. We had planned on working on this game throughout 2014, 2015, 2016, and launching in 2017 without ever seeing a dime of anyone else’s money, simply working on this in our spare time outside of our day jobs, and funding it out of our own pockets.</p>
<p>But your support has shown us that some of you want to help us with the costs, and that’s amazing. So after the vote, we decided to go ahead and do a small Indiegogo to let those of you who want to support us do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1312608/files/20150321041058-shirts.PNG?1426936258"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>As you can see, we aren't doing an all-or-nothing campaign. We are instead doing a flexible funding campaign. That’s because we aren’t a <i>“we need 800,000 USD to build this game or we all go home and don’t build it”</i> group of developers.</p>
<p>Instead, we are a <i>“we are already building this game in our spare time, using our own money, and if you want to help support us, then hell yes”</i> group of people.</p>
<p>The 5,000 USD we are looking for here will mitigate server costs for the upcoming alpha server that you backers will be testing with us, as well as the rest of our needed Unity assets + some legal fees. </p>
<b>But here's something you should know. Indiegogo &amp; Paypal (or Credit Card) each take about 4% of funds we raise IF WE MAKE OUR GOAL. If we don't, they take a whopping 13% (combined). So obviously if we hit our target goal of 5k, it's better. <br/>
</b>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>And if we do hit it, we've got a ton of stretch goals already in place. </div>

</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">If You Don't Need The Money, Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<div>
<p>Good question. First and foremost, we are here because our community voted and asked us to. </p>
<p>Secondly, for those of you who don't know who we are, building an MMORPG is a massive venture. We currently have 12 team members. We are splitting the costs of game development between the team for things like art assets from the Unity store, as well as legal costs, server costs, and beyond. </p>
<p>Just because our day jobs pay our cost of living/bills/put food on the table for our family, doesn't mean we have money coming out of our ears. There are a lot of costs inherent in building a game of this nature. </p>
<p>Thankfully, because our team is working from home, remotely around the world, we don't have the overhead of an office space or the overall costs associated with renting a building and then needing to build/buy rigs for everyone and the like. </p>
<p>Plus, because we all have day jobs, we don't need to go to Kickstarter or Indiegogo and ask for 1+ million dollars so that we can earn a salary while building our game. We're more than willing to work for free in our spare time, building up our hobby and passion into a business that will eventually become our full-time jobs after launch.</p>
<p>However, art assets, licenses, legal fees, and beyond, all start to add up. For example, when we start looking at the art assets we are purchasing from the Unity store, it's very easy to go from 25 bucks here, 60 bucks there, 15 bucks there, 45 dollars there, and suddenly find ourselves in a situation where we are spending 500 - 1000 USD in a week to pick up new assets or code structures that the team needs to use to customize with our own unique twists. </p>
<p><b>We estimate there are around 10,000 USD worth of fees that need to be taken care of in 2015 in between assets we need to purchase + legal fees + licenses and beyond. We'll be spending money out of our own pockets as we have it, but we will also be leveraging crowdfunding from our dedicated fans to help us mitigate those costs as much as possible. </b></p>

</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>None, really. We're already building this game, regardless if anyone backs us or not. Head on over to <a href=""http://sagaoflucimia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website.</a> Check out<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/sagaoflucimia"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> our YouTube channel</a>. You'll see that we've been plugging away the past year without a dime from anyone, and we've said since day one we will never be asking for people to pay our salaries for us until we have a finished product. </p>
<p>Your financial backing helps us mitigate our out-of-pocket expenses, but at no point will a lack of backing from outside sources halt our game development. We make enough money with our day jobs to keep on going until we release Volume I in 2017, so there's no risk as far as we are concerned. </p>
<p><b>That being said, if you guys want to donate and pledge and help our team actually make money while developing this game, I don't see a reason not to run campaigns like this Indiegogo project, or the private crowdfunding that will be coming to our website later in 2015, so long as the desire is there from our community to help our team out in the development of this game. </b></p>

Share this campaign around to your friends, family, business associates, and anyone you can think of that would enjoy a group-based MMORPG that is taking it back to the classic era. </p><p></p></div>","The Saga of Lucimia
 
Welcome to The Saga of Lucimia, a high-fantasy, group-based MMORPG that hearkens back to a time when players worked together to achieve goals that were greater than what they could achieve on their own.  
A time when teamwork, friendship and community meant more than ""everyman"" games chock-full of single-serving, on-the-rails questlines designed to take you to max level in a matter of days in such a way that you never have to interact with another player to achieve the ""end game"". 
No mini-maps. No quest hubs. Zero solo content. 3-4 man overland content, 8-man dungeons, and multi-group raids. No flashing icons over the heads of NPCs telling you who to talk to or where to go, no glowing trails leading you from quest objective to quest objective. 
Languages, factions, ruins, cities, dungeons, and more. A massive world to explore, and a classless, skill-based game where you create your own story with your friends and allies. 
Explore emergent gameplay in a world where the players determine the hot spots, the best places to hunt, their favorite dungeons, routes to and from cities, camp spots, and beyond. With zero single-player storylines guiding you or funneling you from Point A to Point B. Sandbox, not themepark. 
Welcome back to the days of group-based gaming. 


The Fellowship of the Ring was not just one character. Jason had his Argonauts. Zeus went up against The Titans alongside The Olympians. History and mythology is full of examples of epic battles waged in the battle of good versus evil…and none of them are fought single-handed.
Modern-day television enraptures this essence as well, with shows like Firefly, Lost, and The Walking Dead all showcasing a team of players facing up against the odds. And we’ve seen it over the years as well; Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica (both the original and re-imagined), Stargate and beyond.
The greatest adventures are undertaken by groups. The greatest challenges can only be overcome with allies. The greatest rewards come from deeds performed alongside your peers. Dragons aren’t slain by lone heroes; it takes a team of well-oiled champions battling together to bring it down…and then share in the spoils of war together.

If you grew up on Dungeons and Dragons, Ultima Online, EverQuest, and Vanilla World of Warcraft, than you know exactly what we are creating: a group-based game where the only way to move forward is by making strategic progression with allies by your side. 

Our World 
 
Get back to basics with a challenge-based MMORPG focusing on epic adventure the moment you step outside the safety of the city walls. 
This is more than just a game. Ours is a living, breathing world with a rich, deep texture of history and lore, where danger lurks around every corner and adventure awaits the moment you step out of any door.
Magic is non-existent at this point of the world, which is where Volume I picks up, 500 years after the Archemage Chaldeon took the Book of Knowledge into hiding, deeming mankind unfit to handle the responsibility that came with having access to great power. 

Now, all that is left behind are the architectural masterpieces the Elder Races once created, as well as dungeons, scrolls, relics and books that the Scholar’s Guild protects at all costs in a vain attempt to retain as much mastery over their once-great power as possible. Over time, however, their ability to control the relics, decipher the runes and texts and tap into the once-powerful magic, is fading.
You are born into a world where magic is nothing more than a distant memory. Mankind gets things done with the sweat of their brow and with their own two hands. Master Scholars are able to augment the day-to-day aspects of living with various relics, and adventurers with the relevant understanding of runes, lore and the ancient texts can tap into the hidden power of armor and weapons, but the days of Adepts and magic and spells and Elder races are nothing more than myths and legends shown in ancient paintings and faded scrolls and books and stumbled across in long-forgotten dungeons.

We have planned 40 overland zones, 10 dungeons, and 6 cities to explore within The Saga of Lucimia upon completion. And while there is an underlying main storyline that will take you through the game world as you follow along the events of Volume I in The Story So Far, leading you through forests, mountains, ancient dungeons and beyond to uncover the resting place of the Book of Knowledge and bring magic back to the realm (Volume II), the quest content is 100% optional. 

Remember: sandbox, not themepark.If you want to skip the major storylines and quests of the game and just go out there and grind dungeons and overland content and raids with your friends, that's your choice. But if you also enjoy epic storylines, there are multiple chains that you can follow along with, and a rich backstory + in-game lore to immerse yourself in. The main storyline will lead you through small group content (3-4 players) in the overland zones, into the depths of tombs, dungeons, and ruins where 6-8 players are required, and on to multi-group raids where only the truly dedicated will be able to follow along and achieve epic weapons and armor sets as a result of their investment. There are also major storylines related to the overall world and the areas, cities, and outposts. Think the Coldain Ring and Shawl quests from EverQuest. Every questline we are creating is an epic, multi-stage, multi-group campaign meant to span weeks and months. There is no such thing as a single-serving or single-stage quest in the Saga of Lucimia. And every single moment is based around challenge.

What Is Challenge?

If you make the decision to leave the safety of town and its guards, it’s not a decision you should be making lightly. You need to prepare for an adventure that will take multiple game sessions to complete. 
Zones will take hours to multiple game sessions to cross, depending on if you stay on the path or head off into unmarked territory. Dungeons will take weeks to months to complete. Ours is not a game to be played in five minute chunks of time. Ours is a world where you invest yourself just as much as in the real world, and meet up with your friends, family, and allies for scheduled game sessions, just like a D&D campaign around the coffee table. 
You need a balanced group of adventurers to handle whatever you might come across in the wild. You need gear. You need supplies. Bandages. Potions. Scrolls. A pack mule and mounts. Wagons. Extra leather, wood, steel, sharpening stones, tools, and rope. Never leave home without a good length of rope.
It’s an excursion, not an afternoon stroll down to the river to pick daffodils for your sweetheart or mum.
Think the Mines of Moria; we want every dungeon and adventure our players encounter to be on par with what The Fellowship encountered while being forced to skip the pass and head into the mines.
That being said, we understand the limitations of Real Life. Sometimes you can't commit to lengthy gaming sessions day in and day out. You've got a job, spouse, kids, other hobbies, and other commitments. That's what mechanics such as our Camps & Caravans system are being designed for.
Beyond that, we're adding other mechanics to up the ante. For example, there won't be mini-maps in this game. You'll be navigating based on your own ability to figure out where you are in the world or a given zone. You'll be able to find maps for cities that you can store in your inventory and open up to help you navigate the streets, but there won't be a glowing dot with a ""You Are Here"" marker; you'll still need to be able to read the map and figure out where you are in the city.
There will also be NPC-dropped maps that are part of quest chains, as well as those given to you by NPCs as part of quests, but those won't be linked to a mini-map. Instead, it will be based on your ability to read the map in real-time and navigate the world using descriptions and landmarks in conjunction with those maps...if any exist in the first place for whatever it is you are looking for.
And yes, there will be corpse runs; if you die in the wild, your gear will remain on your corpse and it will be up to you (and your friends) to work your way back to where your corpse remains to recover your gear and continue your adventure.

    

The Game
The Saga of Lucimia MMORPG is a group-based, classless game where there are no levels. Instead, we are using a skill-based character system where you can create whatever type of Player Character you want. 

Your selection of skills defines your playstyle and your class. Upon character creation you have the option to choose which skills will define your character during your time in the unfolding saga, customizing your character based upon your own unique combination of skills.
The content of the world can only be overcome by balanced groups of Player Characters leveraging a wide array of skills throughout the Archetypes. The challenges you face are not merely combat-based. Mechanical and magical traps, locks, doorways, and more abound in our world, and if you lack the skills to detect/unlock/overcome those challenges, your progress will come to a halt. 
Dungeons have entire sections dedicated to mechanical traps and doorways that can only be overcome by player with Thief abilities. Other sections are locked away behind magical doorways and rune traps that only a trained Scholar can bypass or detect. If you walk into a dungeon with purely Adventurer Archetypes, you may very well pass by entire wings without even knowing they exist. Or walk into a cavern in the middle of the mountains and never even detect the dungeon entrance in the first place.
Or pass by that tunnel that rises above you and never know that there is an entire wing above the party, because your characters lack climbing skills or tools, and because no one was paying attention and only looking forward. 



While you can create a character from scratch and choose your own skills to start, there is also a list of pre-designed Archetype builds that most long-term gamers and table-top players will be familiar with, such as Monk, Ranger, Thief, Bard and beyond. These builds have pre-selected skill combinations that best define them based upon lore and the type of character they represent. There are also sub-builds, such as the Archer version of the Warrior, or the Assassin version of the Thief.
In addition, these pre-built Archetypes have special advanced abilities assigned to them. Such as a Ranger build having Advanced Tracking. While a player just starting out can choose Tracking at the beginner level, if they want to work their way up to Advanced Tracking they first need to level up their skill...but beyond that, they also have to find the trainer who can teach them the Advanced version of that skill. 
The vast majority of Avanced Trainers are not found in the major cities. Instead, they are out in the world, in the backwater outposts, front lines, caverns, ruins, mountains, forests, canyons, and wilds of the game. Our internal estimation is that roughly 85% of the advanced abilities you can learn in the game will be found outside of the major cities. 
The only way to find these trainers is to have a group capable of exploring the wilds and uncovering them in the first place. And also hoping that you have the prerequisite skills, statistics, faction, and beyond to train with them in the first place. 
Advancement is the result of hard work, given out for achievement, not simply for existing. If you want six-pack abs you have to be prepared to spend a few hours per day in the gym, as well as elminate the garbage from your diet. You don't get ripped by sitting on your ass all day long. 
All characters can be broken down into two Archetypes that you select at the start of your saga. 


Adventurer
The Adventurer Archetype is someone who is comfortable making a living by the skill of their martial abilities, by the sweat of their brow, and by the strength of their arm. They are comfortable in city, world and dungeon environments, and make up the backbone of any adventuring party making its way out beyond the safety of a city or outpost.
Examples of Adventurer Archetypes are Warriors, Thieves, Rangers, Bards, Monks, etc.
Scholar
The Scholar Archetype is someone who is more comfortable making a living with their scholarly abilities, through countless hours of study and research into ancient texts, runes, hieroglyphs and the various relics left behind from The Great War and the years when magic was still a part of the world and the Adepts still roamed the land keeping peace and aiding those in need.
Scholarly Archetypes are able to manipulate relics left behind from before the Great War, activating powers on items through the translation of those very same texts, runes, hieroglyphs and symbols. Scrolls, weapons, armor, old tomes, wands, statues, all fall under the review of a scholar's studious ways.
Scholars provide a support role within groups and are vital components to the ensured survival of a party. They can fill either heal/cure-based roles, utility slots, or damage-dealing roles based upon gear and skill selections.
The scholar's ability to translate ancient texts, languages and symbols also gives them a unique advantage in dungeon settings where certain areas of dungeons will remain forever hidden unless you have a scholar with the relevant skills in your party who can decipher texts to unseal ancient doors locked for centuries, sarcophagi holding the relics of the dead for countless millennia,  and to uncover other hidden mysteries, such as how to trigger an ancient well of resurrection or teleportation....

Combat, Survival, and The World Outside of Cities
The Saga of Lucimia is a game where tactical combat is the only way to move forward. There is zero tank-and-spank, face-roll-on-the-keyboard-to-win content in our game. Instead, we are going back to the basics where crowd control, mob placement, and strategic combat win the day. 

Utility is the key to every group, especially in the depths of a dungeon. And since magic is non-existent during Volume I, there are no clerics or characters who can heal or cast spells during combat. The only way to do so is through the use of relics.
 
Which means there are no in-combat spells or heals outside of those relics which allow for such spells to be cast. Players who have achieved such relics through quests and exploration of the world will be highly sought-after in groups. The same goes for Scholars and Adventurers who have come across magic weapons and armor which allow them to transcend the mundane. 

Which also means combat is extremely tactical. With no in-combat heals, every hitpoint counts. Especially since we are using a D&D-style of stats + hitpoints where there is zero bloat. You won't see players with 10k hitpoints in our world; instead, you'll see a standard 20 - 40 to start with, and 150-300 at the end-game via the use of relic items and sets of gear.  

Which means it is very much a reality to find yourself getting one-shotted if you are a squishy character who doesn't pay attention to where you are standing during combat, or you have a ""bad tank"" who doesn't place mobs properly. And no, there won't be flashy red glowing AOE reticles painted on the ground showing you where mob abilities are going to land. You'll have to figure that out through good old fashioned trial and error.


Strategizing your pulls and ensuring that you have plenty of crowd control is vital to your group's survival. On top of that, you'll need to be able to lock down any fleeing mobs, plus control the placement of the mobs during each encounter to ensure that mobs stay focused on the tanks and not wailing on the support classes who have limited mitigation and armor class, as well as fewer hitpoints. 

Relics can also be game-changing items. For example, teleportation in the Saga of Lucimia does not exist, at least not as a spell during Volume I. A player who has a transportation relic can literally become one of the most powerful players in the game world on his or her server, because he can suddenly travel instantly across great distances. Imagine a guild with a player who can transport raid groups across the world in an instant, while the rest of the players rely on the limited fast-travel options scattered between outposts and cities. 

Healing will largely take place within Encampments via the use of bandages, potions, and good old fashioned regeneration... unless players have relics which can afford them healing. Every group has the ability to set up a Camp during their adventures. These act as waypoints for the group during their adventures outside of the major cities and outposts, and it is here that you can set up a campfire, apply bandages, mend wounds, regenerate your hitpoints, repair your armor, cook food, and beyond. 

There are skills and abilities related to Encampments. Scholars will be able to place wards and traps depending on their ablities/relics, as well as Thief-Archetypes, or Ranger-Archetypes. This will help ward off danger during downtime when you are healing up and mending armor/weapons. 

There are no City Recall abilities in our game, and fast travel options are extremely limited outside of city-to-city or outpost-to-city options (none of which are completely safe; random encounters absolutely exist in our game). Encampments play a vital role in the survival of your group because they act as your group's headquarters during your time out in the field away from the outposts and cities.

Someone has to leave for the night? Emergency room because someone's kid fell and broke their arm, or there's a school play, or work, or movie night with the spouse? They'll be logging back in to the Caravan waypoint the next session. Group needs to break for the weekend? You'll want to set up an Encampment and place your wards/etc. while you log out. More on the Camps & Carvans system here.


When you set out on a campaign, you'll be heading out in a Caravan, which consists of a wagon or two of supplies, plus pack mules and horses. Which, by the way, can be killed. And the only way to get new mounts is to either have a Train Animal ability, or find another player who can train animals and also knows where to find them, or breeds them to sell to other players in the first place. 


Defending your Caravan on the way to the dungeon, not to mention during your adventures, as well as on the way back to the city with all of your hard-earned spoils, is part of the experience. Just as much as you want to haul your well-earned spoils back to town, there are bandits and other dangers in the wilds which will be waiting to take those spoils from you if you aren't strong enough to defend yourselves.

The Encampment + Caravan are vital to your survival in the wild. It is important to have a well-balanced group who can defend, as well as restock and repair the Caravan in between outposts and cities. Skills such as carpentry, leatherworking, armorsmithing, skinning, cooking, and beyond are required for survival in the wilds. If you are three weeks into the depths of a dungeon, you'll need someone along who can repair your armor, mend the broken axle on the wagon, make new potions and food, and tend to the wounds of both players and mounts. 

Since you can't simply recall back to a city every hour or so via the use of an ability, the only way to repair armor or restock your supplies while out on a campaign is either via your own skills or those of your allies. The only way to survive is by working together as a team. 


Gear plays a major role in your ability to survive, as do your character abilities. Relic armor and weapons and gear allow you to transcend mere human strength, dexterity, speed and abilities, and the only way to aquire relic gear is through exploration into the depths of ancient ruins and dungeons, which in turn requires a group for you to conquer. The only way to achieve is by working together as a team.



Community, and your ability to work together and play well with others, is the only way to move forward in The Saga of Lucimia. From the game forums, to the taverns and cities and outposts, to the in-game chat channels, to guilds and static groups, everything is about community and your ability to work within a team. 

What Are We Here For
If you've been following us for the past year since we started this journey back in March of 2014, you know that we've been dedicated to building this game in our spare time outside of our day jobs. We've assembled 12 team members since that time, and we've come a long way. 

We've been 100% transparent with our followers along the way, and have talked about our opinions on the current state of crowdfunding on a few different occassions, such as in this blog post and during the Twitch chat video below with producers Tim Anderson and Giovanni Martello.



Rather than rely on other people, we are funding this game out of our own pockets. We aren’t here on Indiegogo because we need your money. We are doing it because our community voted and asked us to. There are a lot of people out there (far more than we ever anticipated!) who actually WANT to help us fund this game, which has completely blown our minds!
Your support has been overwhelming. We had planned on working on this game throughout 2014, 2015, 2016, and launching in 2017 without ever seeing a dime of anyone else’s money, simply working on this in our spare time outside of our day jobs, and funding it out of our own pockets.
But your support has shown us that some of you want to help us with the costs, and that’s amazing. So after the vote, we decided to go ahead and do a small Indiegogo to let those of you who want to support us do so.


As you can see, we aren't doing an all-or-nothing campaign. We are instead doing a flexible funding campaign. That’s because we aren’t a “we need 800,000 USD to build this game or we all go home and don’t build it” group of developers.
Instead, we are a “we are already building this game in our spare time, using our own money, and if you want to help support us, then hell yes” group of people.
The 5,000 USD we are looking for here will mitigate server costs for the upcoming alpha server that you backers will be testing with us, as well as the rest of our needed Unity assets + some legal fees. 
But here's something you should know. Indiegogo & Paypal (or Credit Card) each take about 4% of funds we raise IF WE MAKE OUR GOAL. If we don't, they take a whopping 13% (combined). So obviously if we hit our target goal of 5k, it's better. 



And if we do hit it, we've got a ton of stretch goals already in place. 




THE CHEERLEADER - 25 USD
The ""Mutton Again?"" tshirt from artist Joseph Bennett, plus two months of access to our alpha servers (same as our Length of Rope shirts).
THE SUPPORTER - 35 USD
The ""Closed Until Alpha"" hoodie from artist Nick Lepperd, plus two months of access to our alpha servers (same as our Length of Rope hoodies).
THE ADVENTURER - 40 USD
Digital copy of Volume I as well as Total Access to all alpha and beta stages as they are available.
THE EXPLORER - 75 USD
Volume I, Total Access, and Starter Relic Weapon (selectable by archetype)
THE FOUNDER - 125 USD
Volume I, Total Access, Starter Relic Weapon + Boots (selectable by archetype), Founder Title
THE PATRON - 200 USD
Volume I, Total Access, Starter Relic Weapon + Boots , Patron Title, monthly Dev Tavern Newsletter featuring special behind-the-scenes access to what the developer team is working on.
THE COLLECTOR - 300 USD
Volume I, Total Access, Starter Relic Weapon + Boots, Collector Title, monthly Dev Tavern Newsletter access, digital Collector's Edition with behind-the-scenes artwork and development tidbits via a PDF, as well as a physical cloth map + loot bag. 



If You Don't Need The Money, Why Indiegogo?

Good question. First and foremost, we are here because our community voted and asked us to. 
Secondly, for those of you who don't know who we are, building an MMORPG is a massive venture. We currently have 12 team members. We are splitting the costs of game development between the team for things like art assets from the Unity store, as well as legal costs, server costs, and beyond. 
Just because our day jobs pay our cost of living/bills/put food on the table for our family, doesn't mean we have money coming out of our ears. There are a lot of costs inherent in building a game of this nature. 
Thankfully, because our team is working from home, remotely around the world, we don't have the overhead of an office space or the overall costs associated with renting a building and then needing to build/buy rigs for everyone and the like. 
Plus, because we all have day jobs, we don't need to go to Kickstarter or Indiegogo and ask for 1+ million dollars so that we can earn a salary while building our game. We're more than willing to work for free in our spare time, building up our hobby and passion into a business that will eventually become our full-time jobs after launch.
However, art assets, licenses, legal fees, and beyond, all start to add up. For example, when we start looking at the art assets we are purchasing from the Unity store, it's very easy to go from 25 bucks here, 60 bucks there, 15 bucks there, 45 dollars there, and suddenly find ourselves in a situation where we are spending 500 - 1000 USD in a week to pick up new assets or code structures that the team needs to use to customize with our own unique twists. 
We estimate there are around 10,000 USD worth of fees that need to be taken care of in 2015 in between assets we need to purchase + legal fees + licenses and beyond. We'll be spending money out of our own pockets as we have it, but we will also be leveraging crowdfunding from our dedicated fans to help us mitigate those costs as much as possible. 


    Risks & Challenges None, really. We're already building this game, regardless if anyone backs us or not. Head on over to our website. Check out our YouTube channel. You'll see that we've been plugging away the past year without a dime from anyone, and we've said since day one we will never be asking for people to pay our salaries for us until we have a finished product. 
Your financial backing helps us mitigate our out-of-pocket expenses, but at no point will a lack of backing from outside sources halt our game development. We make enough money with our day jobs to keep on going until we release Volume I in 2017, so there's no risk as far as we are concerned. 
That being said, if you guys want to donate and pledge and help our team actually make money while developing this game, I don't see a reason not to run campaigns like this Indiegogo project, or the private crowdfunding that will be coming to our website later in 2015, so long as the desire is there from our community to help our team out in the development of this game. 
    
Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute financially, and we get that, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Share this campaign around to your friends, family, business associates, and anyone you can think of that would enjoy a group-based MMORPG that is taking it back to the classic era.",8.0,7,"2 Campaigns

<p><i>C-Board</i> is a clipboard with dimensions 320x230mm made of 100% 3K C200T2 carbon fiber fabric. It features a strong metal clip to hold your A4 papers. Both sides of <i>C-Board</i> have a high gloss ultra smooth surface.</p>
<p><b>What is Carbon Fiber?</b></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/333/597/8583457e6ec08f83e85caa842d93be52_original.jpg?v=1424784294&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=549a93fff965ffe5184cf842cc0407d0"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p>Carbon fiber is made from very small strands of carbon that is woven into a fabric.  That fabric is then combined with epoxy resin and placed into a mold to create complex shapes or laid flat to create a sheet.</p>
<p>This combination of Carbon Fiber fabric and resin creates a composite material with a very high strength to weight ratio. It is often described as being stronger than steel yet lighter than aluminum.</p>
<p><b>Manufacturing Process</b></p>
<p>Carbon fiber fabrics are cut to pieces and placed inside the mold. More filler fabrics applied inside the mold above the first layer of carbon fiber. Last, more carbon fiber fabrics with same dimensions is place inside the mold on top of all the fabrics.</p>
<p>The next step is to apply a releasing film called peel-ply. That fabric act as a separator of the finished part (carbon fiber part) and the fabrics that added after carbon fiber fabrics.</p>
<p>Next fabric is the flow fabric. That fabric helps the epoxy resin to fill every corner of our mold.</p>
<p>Last, is the vacuum bagging film. This is the sealant bag that creates the vacuum needed to put pressure on our part inside the mold, with the help of a vacuum pump.</p>
<p>When we are ready with our vacuum sealant, epoxy resin enters the mold and infuses our entire pack of fabrics.</p>
<p>After some hours, the epoxy resin is cured and the carbon fiber part can be removed from our mold.</p>
<p>Next step is to trim the carbon fiber part to the final dimensions of the clipboard. Last, the metal clip is added on the carbon fiber clipboard with rivets.</p>
<p><b>The carbon fiber clipboard is manufactured with Vacuum Infusion Method</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/333/553/42c04bb1ab96b0f177527293dc3a9d0b_original.jpg?v=1424782912&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8d5c451840699fa723d8ec25d7f45ea4"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p>
<p>The Vacuum Infusion Process (VIP) is a technique that uses vacuum pressure to drive resin into a laminate. Materials are laid dry into the mold and the vacuum is applied before resin is introduced into the mold. Once a complete vacuum is achieved, resin is literally sucked into the laminate via carefully placed tubing. This process is aided by an assortment of supplies and materials.</p>
<p>Vacuum infusion provides a number of improvements over traditionally vacuum bagged parts. These benefits include:</p>
<p>• Better fiber-to-resin ratio</p>
<p>• Very consistent resin usage</p>
<p>• Lightweight products</p>
<p>The properties of carbon fibers, such as high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion, make them very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, and motorsports, along with other competition sports.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Molding technique</p>
<p>One of our major milestone was to develop a molding technique to highlight the carbon fiber, whilst keeping the mechanical properties of it. The technique we've developed allowed us to place the carbon fiber fabric in an aesthetic manner without wave distortion and without cutting the fabric to preserve its strength. </p>
<p>Delivery Schedule </p>
<p>Part of our work was to design a manufacturing process that could realistically produce large quantities of C-Boards without impairing the quality. The infusion molding technique, with hand-made molds and pre-cut fiber was part of the solution.</p>
<p>Perfection </p>
<p>Our prototype is in continuous improvement. Our latest prototype is beyond your expectations as it features some more additional subtle features for both a better aesthetic and a smoother finish.</p>
<p>Your satisfaction </p>

</div></div>","C-Board is a clipboard with dimensions 320x230mm made of 100% 3K C200T2 carbon fiber fabric. It features a strong metal clip to hold your A4 papers. Both sides of C-Board have a high gloss ultra smooth surface.
What is Carbon Fiber?

Carbon fiber is made from very small strands of carbon that is woven into a fabric.  That fabric is then combined with epoxy resin and placed into a mold to create complex shapes or laid flat to create a sheet.
This combination of Carbon Fiber fabric and resin creates a composite material with a very high strength to weight ratio. It is often described as being stronger than steel yet lighter than aluminum.
Manufacturing Process
Carbon fiber fabrics are cut to pieces and placed inside the mold. More filler fabrics applied inside the mold above the first layer of carbon fiber. Last, more carbon fiber fabrics with same dimensions is place inside the mold on top of all the fabrics.
The next step is to apply a releasing film called peel-ply. That fabric act as a separator of the finished part (carbon fiber part) and the fabrics that added after carbon fiber fabrics.
Next fabric is the flow fabric. That fabric helps the epoxy resin to fill every corner of our mold.
Last, is the vacuum bagging film. This is the sealant bag that creates the vacuum needed to put pressure on our part inside the mold, with the help of a vacuum pump.
When we are ready with our vacuum sealant, epoxy resin enters the mold and infuses our entire pack of fabrics.
After some hours, the epoxy resin is cured and the carbon fiber part can be removed from our mold.
Next step is to trim the carbon fiber part to the final dimensions of the clipboard. Last, the metal clip is added on the carbon fiber clipboard with rivets.
The carbon fiber clipboard is manufactured with Vacuum Infusion Method.

 
The Vacuum Infusion Process (VIP) is a technique that uses vacuum pressure to drive resin into a laminate. Materials are laid dry into the mold and the vacuum is applied before resin is introduced into the mold. Once a complete vacuum is achieved, resin is literally sucked into the laminate via carefully placed tubing. This process is aided by an assortment of supplies and materials.
Vacuum infusion provides a number of improvements over traditionally vacuum bagged parts. These benefits include:
• Better fiber-to-resin ratio
• Very consistent resin usage
• Lightweight products
The properties of carbon fibers, such as high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion, make them very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, and motorsports, along with other competition sports.
Advantages of C-Board compared to other clipboards
·Lifetime usage
·Rip and crease resistant
·Retain shape and resist bending
·100% waterproof
Below you can see the strength of C-Board, weighting just 200gr.That’s 10kgs above C-Board.

 
Budget and timeline
Our current prototypes are created on rented equipment designed for punctual prototyping purposes. Our molds are not ready for anything close to a manufacturing volume.
We need the funds to purchase adequate tooling, exercise high-volume orders on raw materials/components and create the new manufacture-ready molds. These steps cannot be accomplished without adequate funding.
Your funds will help us implement a real production setup and give us the ability to bring this product on the market at a realistic price and guaranteed quality.


 

The complete first cycle from production until dispatch of the product is listed below.

Risks and challenges
Molding technique
One of our major milestone was to develop a molding technique to highlight the carbon fiber, whilst keeping the mechanical properties of it. The technique we've developed allowed us to place the carbon fiber fabric in an aesthetic manner without wave distortion and without cutting the fabric to preserve its strength. 
Delivery Schedule 
Part of our work was to design a manufacturing process that could realistically produce large quantities of C-Boards without impairing the quality. The infusion molding technique, with hand-made molds and pre-cut fiber was part of the solution.
Perfection 
Our prototype is in continuous improvement. Our latest prototype is beyond your expectations as it features some more additional subtle features for both a better aesthetic and a smoother finish.
Your satisfaction 
We want to make sure that you will be happy with the product that you will receive from us. Our goal is to have you enjoy as much time as possible with your new item.

<h3>Perché?</h3>
<p>Confronto nasce durante una giornata d'estate 2016, in un momento di noia. Mi chiedevo se potesse esistere un gioco competitivo e bilanciato senza creare delle vere e proprie carte, ma utilizzando le carte più famose al mondo, le carte da Poker!</p>
<p>Beh, a quanto pare, qualcosa è uscito fuori. ""Confronto"" si ispira molto ai tradizionali giochi di carte collezionabili ma  ne riduce drasticamente il prezzo (eliminando la componente collezionabile). Non voglio perdermi molto in chiacchiere, voglio che siate voi a decidere se il gioco vale o meno il vostro tempo, di seguito vi spiegherò il perché di questa campagna e poi vi illustrerò le regole.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ma se posso giocare con delle normali carte da poker... che senso ha questa campagna?</h3>
<p>Bene, questa domanda è più che giusta. Perché una persona dovrebbe pagare per giocare ad un gioco che è gratis?</p>
<p>Beh, se avete notato, io non chiedo decine di mila euro per completare la mia campagna, ma chiedo solo €2500 che serviranno a pagare la creazione di mazzi personalizzati, con esclusivi artwork per ogni carta e la stampa dei mai stessi. Solo questo! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Le regole!</h3>
<p>leggete questo PDF per l'ultima versione delle regole di gioco!<br/><a href=""https://document.li/HfML"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://document.li/HfML</a></p>
<p>“Confronto!“ è un gioco di carte creato in estate 2016 giocabile facilmente con un solo mazzo da 54 carte francesi (da poker, per intenderci).<br/> </p>
<p>SCOPO DEL GIOCO</p>
<p>Lo scopo del gioco è ridurre i punti vita all’avversario a 0 tramite i “Confronti!”. Ogni giocatore ad inizio partita ha 21 punti vita.<br/><br/>PREPARAZIONE DEL GIOCO</p>
<p>Prendete un mazzo di 54 carte (52 + 2 Joker) e dividetelo in due mazzi, uno composto da tutte le carte con i semi rossi ed uno con tutte le carte con i semi neri. Poi, prendete un Joker a testa.</p>
<p>Prendete uno dei due mazzi (sono identici se non per i semi) e date l’altro al vostro avversario. Successivamente posizionate i mazzi alla vostra sinistra orizzontalmente.</p>
<p>Guardate la figura 1 per capire lo stato del campo.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479305859/fqan1nrsuyaw4jep63zb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>IL CONFRONTO!</p>
<p>Eccoci giunti al fulcro del gioco: il “Confronto!”.</p>
<p>Esistono due tipi di “Confronto!”: il “Confronto!” diretto e il “Confronto!” contro un’ altra carta. Vediamo le fasi di battaglia.</p>
<p>Fase 1 - Dichiarazione di “Confronto!”:<br/>ll giocatore, esclusivamente durante il suo turno, dichiara un “attacco” da                     parte di una delle sue carte sul terreno verso una specifica carta dell’avversario. Se l’avversario non ha carte sul terreno, il “Confronto!” diventa diretto.In questo caso passa al punto 1.1; altrimenti, passa al punto 2.<br/><br/>Fase 1.1 - Ace SpAce:</p>
<p>Il giocatore avversario decide se usare o meno un Asso, sempre che ne abbia uno in mano. Se l’avversario non ha Assi in mano o non vuole giocarlo passa alla fase 1.2 per terminare il “Confronto!”.</p>
<p>Se l’asso viene giocato, sia questo che la carta che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” viengono posizionati nella rispettiva pila degli scarti.</p>
<p>Ricorda! In caso in cui la carta che dichiara il “Confronto!” sia un Doppio, esso non viene spaccato completamente ma viene privato solo di una delle due carte, dopo, potrà attaccare nuovamente.</p>
<p>Dopo questa fase, il giocatore di turno può continuare ad attaccare con le sue altre carte. Quindi la fase di battaglia viene riavviata. </p>
<p>( Ricorda, puoi anche giocare un Ace Breaker).<br/> </p>
<p>Fase 1.2 - Confronto diretto - Danno</p>
<p>Ora sottrai il valore della carta a quello dei punti vita del tuo avversario. Ricorda, ogni giocatore ad inizio partita ha 21 punti.</p>
<p>Dopo che il danno è andato a buon fine, taglia (distruggi) la carta che ha appena confrontato direttamente e posizionala in cima alla pila degli scarti.</p>
<p>Ora è ancora il tuo turno, puoi attaccare nuovamente, in tal caso, la fase di battaglia si riavvia.<br/> </p>
<p>Fase 2: - Ace SpAce:</p>
<p>Il giocatore avversario decide se usare o meno un Asso, sempre che ne abbia uno in mano. Se l’avversario non ha Assi in mano o non vuole giocarlo, passa alla fase 2.1 per contunuare il confronto. </p>
<p>Se l’asso viene giocato, il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” non infligge danno all’avversario. Al termine di questa fase l’asso, la carta che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” e la carta su cui è stato dichiarato il “Confronto!” vengono posizionate nella rispettiva pila degli scarti.</p>
<p>Ricorda! In caso in cui la carta che dichiara il confronto sia un Doppio, esso non viene spaccato completamente ma viene privato solo di una delle due carte, dopo, potrà attaccare nuovamente.</p>
<p>Dopo questa fase, il giocatore di turno può continuare ad attaccare con le sue altre carte. Quindi la fase di battaglia viene riavviata. </p>
<p>( Ricorda, puoi anche giocare un Ace Breaker).<br/><br/>Fase 2.1: - “Confronto!” tra due carte.<br/>Attenzione! un doppio privato della sua metà (eccetto il caso in cui l’avversario ha usato un Asso) non può riconfrontarsi nello stesso turno. Ricorda: una volta che hai dichiarato il primo “Confronto!”, non puoi spostare o posizionare nessuna carta, neanche i “K” o gli “Assi”.</p>
<p>Bene! è ora di confrontarsi! </p>
<p>Se il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” lo ha fatto verso un carta in posizione Cavaliera -&gt; vai alla fase 2.1.1</p>
<p>Se il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” lo ha fatto verso un carta in posizione Mistero -&gt; vai alla fase 2.1.2</p>
<p>Se il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” lo ha fatto verso un carta in posizione Scudo -&gt; vai alla fase 2.1.3<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479306155/xitni2dtdzwnffp63mth.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>""Confronto! Competitive""</h3>
<p>Se avete letto il PDF, avrete sicuramente notato una variane del gioco chiamata ""Confronto! Competitive"".</p>
<p>Per questa versione ho deciso di creare alcune carte speciali, ogni carta ha un effetto particolare ma ogni carta  è equilibrata con le altre, quindi non esiste una carta più forte ed una più debole, è tutto in base a come il giocatore sceglie di giocare. Ogni giocatore può scegliere una carta tra tutte le carte speciali e inserirla nel mazzo! </p>
</div></div>","Perché?
Confronto nasce durante una giornata d'estate 2016, in un momento di noia. Mi chiedevo se potesse esistere un gioco competitivo e bilanciato senza creare delle vere e proprie carte, ma utilizzando le carte più famose al mondo, le carte da Poker!
Beh, a quanto pare, qualcosa è uscito fuori. ""Confronto"" si ispira molto ai tradizionali giochi di carte collezionabili ma  ne riduce drasticamente il prezzo (eliminando la componente collezionabile). Non voglio perdermi molto in chiacchiere, voglio che siate voi a decidere se il gioco vale o meno il vostro tempo, di seguito vi spiegherò il perché di questa campagna e poi vi illustrerò le regole.

Ma se posso giocare con delle normali carte da poker... che senso ha questa campagna?
Bene, questa domanda è più che giusta. Perché una persona dovrebbe pagare per giocare ad un gioco che è gratis?
Beh, se avete notato, io non chiedo decine di mila euro per completare la mia campagna, ma chiedo solo €2500 che serviranno a pagare la creazione di mazzi personalizzati, con esclusivi artwork per ogni carta e la stampa dei mai stessi. Solo questo! 

Le regole!
leggete questo PDF per l'ultima versione delle regole di gioco!https://document.li/HfML
“Confronto!“ è un gioco di carte creato in estate 2016 giocabile facilmente con un solo mazzo da 54 carte francesi (da poker, per intenderci). 
SCOPO DEL GIOCO
Lo scopo del gioco è ridurre i punti vita all’avversario a 0 tramite i “Confronti!”. Ogni giocatore ad inizio partita ha 21 punti vita.PREPARAZIONE DEL GIOCO
Prendete un mazzo di 54 carte (52 + 2 Joker) e dividetelo in due mazzi, uno composto da tutte le carte con i semi rossi ed uno con tutte le carte con i semi neri. Poi, prendete un Joker a testa.
Prendete uno dei due mazzi (sono identici se non per i semi) e date l’altro al vostro avversario. Successivamente posizionate i mazzi alla vostra sinistra orizzontalmente.
Guardate la figura 1 per capire lo stato del campo.


IL CONFRONTO!
Eccoci giunti al fulcro del gioco: il “Confronto!”.
Esistono due tipi di “Confronto!”: il “Confronto!” diretto e il “Confronto!” contro un’ altra carta. Vediamo le fasi di battaglia.
Fase 1 - Dichiarazione di “Confronto!”:ll giocatore, esclusivamente durante il suo turno, dichiara un “attacco” da                     parte di una delle sue carte sul terreno verso una specifica carta dell’avversario. Se l’avversario non ha carte sul terreno, il “Confronto!” diventa diretto.In questo caso passa al punto 1.1; altrimenti, passa al punto 2.Fase 1.1 - Ace SpAce:
Il giocatore avversario decide se usare o meno un Asso, sempre che ne abbia uno in mano. Se l’avversario non ha Assi in mano o non vuole giocarlo passa alla fase 1.2 per terminare il “Confronto!”.
Se l’asso viene giocato, sia questo che la carta che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” viengono posizionati nella rispettiva pila degli scarti.
Ricorda! In caso in cui la carta che dichiara il “Confronto!” sia un Doppio, esso non viene spaccato completamente ma viene privato solo di una delle due carte, dopo, potrà attaccare nuovamente.
Dopo questa fase, il giocatore di turno può continuare ad attaccare con le sue altre carte. Quindi la fase di battaglia viene riavviata. 
( Ricorda, puoi anche giocare un Ace Breaker). 
Fase 1.2 - Confronto diretto - Danno
Ora sottrai il valore della carta a quello dei punti vita del tuo avversario. Ricorda, ogni giocatore ad inizio partita ha 21 punti.
Dopo che il danno è andato a buon fine, taglia (distruggi) la carta che ha appena confrontato direttamente e posizionala in cima alla pila degli scarti.
Ora è ancora il tuo turno, puoi attaccare nuovamente, in tal caso, la fase di battaglia si riavvia. 
Fase 2: - Ace SpAce:
Il giocatore avversario decide se usare o meno un Asso, sempre che ne abbia uno in mano. Se l’avversario non ha Assi in mano o non vuole giocarlo, passa alla fase 2.1 per contunuare il confronto. 
Se l’asso viene giocato, il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” non infligge danno all’avversario. Al termine di questa fase l’asso, la carta che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” e la carta su cui è stato dichiarato il “Confronto!” vengono posizionate nella rispettiva pila degli scarti.
Ricorda! In caso in cui la carta che dichiara il confronto sia un Doppio, esso non viene spaccato completamente ma viene privato solo di una delle due carte, dopo, potrà attaccare nuovamente.
Dopo questa fase, il giocatore di turno può continuare ad attaccare con le sue altre carte. Quindi la fase di battaglia viene riavviata. 
( Ricorda, puoi anche giocare un Ace Breaker).Fase 2.1: - “Confronto!” tra due carte.Attenzione! un doppio privato della sua metà (eccetto il caso in cui l’avversario ha usato un Asso) non può riconfrontarsi nello stesso turno. Ricorda: una volta che hai dichiarato il primo “Confronto!”, non puoi spostare o posizionare nessuna carta, neanche i “K” o gli “Assi”.
Bene! è ora di confrontarsi! 
Se il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” lo ha fatto verso un carta in posizione Cavaliera -> vai alla fase 2.1.1
Se il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” lo ha fatto verso un carta in posizione Mistero -> vai alla fase 2.1.2
Se il giocatore che ha dichiarato il “Confronto!” lo ha fatto verso un carta in posizione Scudo -> vai alla fase 2.1.3


""Confronto! Competitive""

entirely create a new high quality virtual card and board game that I could
share with the world. 
Enter PAPER KINGDOM, an
improvised game-play four player luck-based card cum board game that is based on a very
popular game in India, my home country.
I have made PAPER KINGDOM
with enhanced crisp and fun graphics and a more modern twist, giving it also a
smart international feel, keeping in sight the kind of gaming profile that card
and board games enthusiasts have.
PAPER KINGDOM is the
perfect program for a group of four friends to relax and have fun together, in
an entertaining and somewhat addictive way – you’ll find out that your greatest
challenge may actually be to stop playing the game!Four players are required to play Paper Kingdom. There are four cards in the game.At the beginning of the round shuffle the cards
and have every player take a card. They can look at it but can’t show it to
anyone else. Whoever drew the king card turns it face up and gets 3 points.

Next whoever drew the guard card turns it face
up. They have to guess which of the remaining two players has the thief card.
If they chose correctly they get two points, the
thief gets 0 point and the player with the birdy card gets 1 point. If the guard
chooses incorrectly, they get 0 point and the thief gets 2 points. Birdy
still gets 1 point.


The king can choose to move forward 3 squares or to move forward 2 squares and then move an opposing player back 1 square. After all the cards are revealed, king moves after everyone does.
Birdy moves forward 1 square. Which
ever player received 2 points moves 2 squares and which ever player received 0
point stays where they are.                                                                          
                                                                         The Board






While moving forward on the board, (a) If a player lands on a square which has minus one(-1) on it, he/she has to move one step back. (b) If someone lands on a square with plus one(+1), they can move one step forward. (c) If someone is having a bad day and lands on ""Go to start"", they go back to the start line.


If you enjoy gaming, and
if you are especially into card and board games, you can get exciting special
features while also becoming a pioneer funder of Paper Kingdom:


I invite you to choose
one of the great rewards that I have on offer, with special edition cards and limited
editions of the game for you, as an early backer. 







 I also invite you to share this campaign with your friends and family who also enjoy gaming and who might want to secure their limited edition of Paper Kingdom.





If I manage to raise more than what I pledged, I'll create two more versions of the game and art books where I'll put all the art works together and everyone who helped this campaign by ordering any version of the game will get these extras for free.









My name is Apurba Debnath. I am an indie game designer, artist and animator.   I have been working in casual gaming industry for last 4 and half years and I've worked on many games for web and mobile platforms. I am the author of flash games ""Die For a Lie"" and ""Humble Jungle Puzzle"". ""Die For a Lie"" is a web based action-shooter game which was published by Armor Games. ""Humble Jungle Puzzle"" is a fun and kid friendly puzzle game and was published by Gamezhero. I am also developing casual games along with my mate, under the name Talltoy Games, 

at the same time my  focus is on  making some simple, quick and addictive card games and Paper Kingdom is my first card game that I am working on and since I have developed the advanced concept, with all the details, and will be taking its full development and production forward on my own, I am now raising funds to be able to finish the project, having a chance to fully focusing on making it absolutely engaging, both in terms of graphics, functions and fun-wise.



Thanks to Chintan, Shahad and Rajesh for helping me with testing the game. It was really a great time and thanks to Steven for his voice.  And my special thanks to Kevin MacLeod for his beautiful music track, that I used in the video.



Do you want to know if the game is fun enough for you? May be you would like to give it a  try before you contribute! Good news, I have 4 digital demo cards and a board available for download. After you download image files you can take print out and play the game. To play this game you need 4 cards and a board, also a chip for each player.Here is the download link(dropbox):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you can't contribute financially, that's alright. Please share this campaign with your friends and family and help make this campaign a reality. Any kind of help, would be greatly appreciated.If you have any question or suggestion or just want to say hi, feel free to contact me at hello@paperkingdom.net. Thank you and enjoy the game. Cheers!",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Is this a joke?</h3>
<p>No, we are actually making this game.  The security of our airlines is NOT a joke!</p>
<p>We have already created a <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/546650"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">successful VR game</a> and have the team and skills to make it happen.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>This game is important because it can be a great training tool for future flight attendants.  Not every flight attendant has formal training in martial arts, and without martial arts skills the world's flight attendants are ill prepared for their jobs in the current airline industry.  <strong>Voluntary Disembarkment </strong>can be the perfect training tool.</p>
<p><strong>Game Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Find ""volunteer"" passengers</strong> hiding in their seats. Bonus points for passengers with lower ticket prices.</li>
<li>
<strong>Knock out the volunteer</strong> with your fists, luggage from over head bins, or even the coffee pot.</li>
<li>
<strong>Everything item on the plane is interactable.</strong>  That includes the snack cart, luggage, passengers, the cockpit, you name it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Drag the volunteer through the aisle and toss them out the exit doors.  </strong>The farther the throw the more points you get.  Make sure you find and toss their luggage as well.</li>
<li><strong>Start on a small bi-plane and work your way up to Commercial Airlines.</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Passengers annoyance level increase as the game goes on</strong>, causing them to start demanding rights.  Remind them of their ""rights"" with a swift punch to the jaw and collect bonus points.</li>
<li>
<strong>Collect rewards form the CEO</strong> for abusing your power.</li>
<li>
<strong>Final Boss: </strong>Voluntarily disembark the CEO from his private jet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Image a mix between Job Simulator, Drunken Bar Fight, and Baby Toss.  Every item on the plane will be interactable, some people will fight back, and every person can be tossed off the plane with no regard to their civil liberties or human rights.</p>
<p>As a contributor you can help us train flight attendants and airport security of tomorrow in proper disermbarkment techniques.  You cannot stop airlines from beating you, so why not invest in ensuring they do it properly: violently and without mercy.</p>

<h3>What We Need and Why we need it.</h3>
<p>We are going to need a humble $30,000 to build the game.  That may seem like a lot, but when you factor in the costs of 3d models, development time, and the corporate lawsuits this project will inevitably lead to, we are probably better off being forcefully re-accommodated.  </p>
<p>The game is in the works, but the more funds we can raise the better experience we can produce.  That means better graphics, more game modes, more realistic blood when passengers ""fall down"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Executives, politicians and other authority figures get to abuse their power on a daily basis.   Most of us have morals holding us back.  Voluntary Disembarkment give you the experience of abusing your power without worrying about the moral or ethical considerations.  </p>
<p>The violence of our previous experience building a boxing VR game, will directly translate into creating the most realistic experience as a flight attendant on a corporate airliner.  We have also spent countless hours being delayed, lied to, and generally annoyed on planes.  This first-hand experience will help us create an accurate representation of the VR passengers annoyance levels.  Voluntary Disembarkment will be the boldest, most realistic flight attendant experience ever created.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>Everyone who contributes to our IndieGoGo (enough to qualify for the first reward) will receive the full game of Voluntary Disembarkment and all of its updates free, forever until the final release! The game is currently in its alpha stage. We plan on developing it over the next couple years yet, so there is much more to come. It will be digital download only.  There are many other rewards such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Naming in-game content</b></li>
<li><b>All the luggage will have various stickers on them.  You get to make your own design that we will slap on the luggage in the overhead bin.</b></li>
<li><b>Extra airliners that only our supporters will be able to access.</b></li>
<li><b>Custom t-shirts</b></li>
<li><b>Branded mouth guards to for future travel</b></li>
<li><b>Useless $50 Vouchers</b></li>

</ul>
<h3>What if you do not reach your goal?</h3>
<p>Last December our flight to Florida, USA was delayed over 3 hours in Dublin, Ireland.  It was a major headache.  On the bright side, we recently received a $1000 check from the airline thanks to the superior consumer rights in Europe. Unfortunately most countries, such as the United States, do not have those kind of protections.  In fact, you can be assaulted for being a customer.  We see the current events in the airline industry and our experience developing for VR as an opportunity to make a fun satirical game and raise awareness for consumer rights.</p>
<p>The more money we raise the more time we can dedicate to creating more environments and game modes and developing top of the line visual effects.   We believe will add more replay value to the game and improve the chances of our game becoming official training material of airlines everywhere.  </p>
<p>Once we finish Voluntary Disembarkment, we will <strong>donate 100% of the extra funds to a consumer rights organization</strong> protecting airline passengers, such as FlyersRights.org.  If we do not raise enough funds to complete the game, all proceeds will be donated.</p>

finished the prototype. Now we need you to jump on board so we can move into production sooner and
create the most immersive and interactive way to deliver memorialisation that’s
ever been done before.
We
have a campaign goal of $30,000 so we can make the E-ternal app a reality. The
future is already here; we just need you to bring it directly to your
smart device.
With
worldwide patents pending, we are set to revolutionise the memorialisation
industry. 
Your
contribution will be used directly to:


Build the
downloadable version of the E-ternal app for iPhone and Android devices
Licence our augmented
reality platforms for E-ternal

Secure our worldwide
patents for E-ternal

We
want to make this the best app of its kind, so your support is greatly needed
and appreciated. Your contributions will ensure we can create, make and test
the most groundbreaking version of our app.I am a graduate of the New Venture Institute's Venture Dorm program. This intensive
entrepreneurial program is run by Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia and provided me with the
platform to incubate and launch my idea and secure my first customers. I
self-funded my permanent online memorial business and successfully launched Eternal Memoria in
mid-2016. Eternal Memoria has gained great momentum in a traditional space that
has been slow to innovate.I
will continue to self-fund the development of my E-ternal app, but you supporting me now means I get there that much faster!
There
has been and will continue to be challenges and resistance as we blaze a trail
in the traditional space of memorialisation. I strongly believe that AR will
greatly enrich the experience at the cemetery or memorial. Funding this
campaign is a chance to break new ground and adopt a new technology never seen
before in this space.
And
just because you can’t contribute you can still help is make E-ternal a
reality.

</div></div>","In a Nutshell
MMOExaminer was created by a group of journalists who got fed up with having to read gaming news articles that are clearly influenced by outside factors and do not necessarily present the truth. We plan to create a completely truthful, direct and honest news source that will bring you facts and not sponsored information. 
What is MMOExaminer?

MMOExaminer is currently a newborn project that needs YOUR help to grow. We are a team of professional journalists who strive to reshape the current state of video gaming journalism. We want to create a news portal where news are not influenced by sponsors and where you will get what you came for. 

Quality & Experience
We are all writers who have worked with well-known MMO news sites, like the creator of the project who is a full-time writer at MMOSite.com. Based on our previous experiences we have plenty of past mistakes we can learn from and we now know how we can satisfy our readers. 


We Are Gamers Too
Journalists often attempt to write about topics that they are unfamiliar with and do their best to put together information from various sources just to complete an article. We are different. All the writers at MMOExaminer are both journalists and veteran gamers who have been playing since the 90s. Because of this, we can combine our gaming knowledge with our experiences in journalism and produce articles that accurately cover any topic that is related to the industry.


What do we offer?
We want to provide our readers with the chance to read articles about MMO Games that inform accurately and right on time. We will be constantly interviewing gamers, developers and publishers to enable you to get a clear picture of gaming industries. We do not wish to write our posts based on what other sites have written, we wish to obtain information right from the original source so that we can write articles that contain unaltered details.
Global Monitoring
We will be hiring people from all around the world in order to be able to provide gaming news from various regions, from East to West. We will be covering NA and EU developed games as well as Asian MMOs and much more. 


News 24/7
MMOExaminer will provide you with posts all day long, regardless of your timezone. We have journalists from various parts of the world who will post articles on a daily basis without a break. 







MMOExaminer consists of journalists with a great experience who had worked for sites like MMOSite and because of this, we will be able to provide you with high-quality posts that are carefully formulated and proofread. No lazy, short posts that are full of errors and typos. Every single article will be checked.Constant ContentMMOExaminer will provide you with something to read every day, every hour. You will be able to check back all day and find something new to discover. We will cover all sorts of MMO categories from MMORPGS to MOBAs, online shooters, online sports games and much more. We will also be covering retro games to satisfy veteran gamers.Streamer SupportIf we manage to reach our goal on IndieGogo, not only will we pay attention to streamers. but we will also strive to promote them and even sponsor them. We will launch a section on MMOExaminer.com where streamers can apply to get sponsored, and we will do our best to help them.



The current video gaming journalism is packed with posts that are heavily influenced by sponsors. This results in inaccurate presentations of MMO games that do not inform the readers the way they should. At MMOExaminer, all of our reviews, previews, discussions and news posts will be uninfluenced by any external entity. We will tell you the truth whether it's good or bad. We will be posting news without being influenced by advertisers, publishers and developers.We Will ListenMMOExaminer will be interactive. We will be constantly communicating with you guys in order to meet your demands and cover the things that you want to read about. We will listen to feedback and take criticism as something to build our development upon.We Will Communicate With GamersIt is the gamers that keep the industry alive, and we want to let our readers see what other gamers think. How they see games, new content, eSports, how they beat endgame and so on. We will be interviewing gamers from a variety of MMO games on a daily basis.No Ridiculous GiveawaysWhen we run a giveaway, it will be something you guys actually want to get. We recently began our first event through which we are giving away an actual World of Warcraft Legion Expansion to a lucky reader. We will strive to reward our readers with nifty gifts that will put a smile on your face.MMOExaminer needs your support to be able to create a quality news source. To be able to employ professional and skilled journalists we need to be able to pay them. Our current funds will not be able to keep us going for a long time and because of this, we decided that Indiegogo is the right place to ask for help. We are also in need of a far better website system that can allow readers to fully enjoy our content and to get informed efficiently. If our fundraiser goal is fulfilled we will build a completely new site that will have all the necessary functions of a gaming news portal. As you can see from our rewards section, those who support us will not go unnoticed. We will be doing our best to become worthy of your support and to create such a unique gaming news portal that will stand out from the current generic video gaming journalism lineup. The funds that we receive from this Indiegogo project will all go into paying our writers, travelling to gaming related events and maintaining the website. We want to provide quality service, and for that, investments are necessary.

<p>Research tells us that parents consistently over estimate their child’s happiness.   And with teenagers, who knows?   The last person they want to share anything with is a parent.   So how do parents stay on top of their child’s well-being but more importantly ensure their emotional resiliency?   They turn them on to K’Bro! Here’s a chance to give your child a game that’s good for them and fun all at the same time.  K’Bro teaches emotional literacy, self-advocacy and better coping skills.</p>
<p>At K’Bro, we’re committed to giving kids, and parents, the tools to be able to recognize when children need an intervention either by a trusted peer, parent or therapist.  As the child plays the “Am I OK?” game or uses other features in the app, K’Bro anonymously captures data about your child’s emotional state that informs the “Am I OK?” index.   We use artificial intelligence much the way Siri works today to analyze when your child’s behavior is worrisome and when it’s not.   Parents can choose to subscribe to K’Bro to receive weekly updates and alerts if warranted with conversation starter tips.  Actual comments by kids remain private protecting their privacy and willingness to share.  K’Bro is always free to kids so they will know for themselves if they’re doing OK and use the many features within K’Bro to build emotional resiliency all on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing K’Bro</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475455189/xsuvioxh6jugetxxhy7r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>K’Bro is an emotional resiliency app that is addictingly fun to play while developing skills to manage difficulties in a child’s life.  Moreover, it can be an early indicator that something is not quite right, facilitating parental engagement and other interventions.</p>
<p>Part game/part anonymous sharing/part knowledgebase, K’Bro is a safe place to share your thoughts and emotions and get advice on how to deal with life’s challenges while getting validation on how well you’re doing through the “Am I OK?” index.</p>
<p>Deep learning using semantic search and natural language processing of emotions expressed and issues raised via anonymous sharing will produce a daily “Am I OK?” index score to let kids and their parents know how well they’re doing, alerting parents when there is cause for concern.</p>

<p>K’Bro captures four emotions out of 12 (six positive options and six negative options) for four categories in a child’s life:  School, Family Life, Social Life and Everything Else.   This helps K’Bro pinpoint if a child is not doing OK and which aspect of their life is where they’re having issues.   For example, grades may be falling, but it’s really the relationship with their coach that’s at issue.  The game is ""addictingly"" fun because once they’ve shared their emotions, they play a fun runner game competing with their friends to see who captures the most acorns. And their positive use of the game is rewarded with additional acorns.</p>

<p>K’Bro provides a knowledge base dedicated to adolescent topics to help kids figure out to handle things on their own.  If they don’t find the answer they’re looking for, they can ask the My Tribe community anonymously how other kids have handled similar issues.   Kids get the chance to vote “good idea” or “bad idea” on feedback others provide and to block anyone whose answer seem inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>K’Bro Speak Up! Feature</strong></p>

<p>K’Bro created “Speak Up!” to help kids practice advocating for themselves.  In many ways, it’s the letter you write to process your emotions but never send. It’s also the opportunity to provide positive or negative feedback to someone as part of self-advocacy even with you the parent!   Kids have the option of asking My Tribe to provide feedback on their response by rating it “Helpful” or “Hurtful” to ensure your child sends a productive message to accomplish their self-advocacy goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>K’Bro What’s Up? Feature</strong></p>

<p>What’s Up? is where kids get to practice gratitude on a daily basis.   Each day they’ll be asked three questions to highlight what’s going right in their life.   If they have a “not so OK day” on the index, they’ll be reminded of all the stuff that’s going right to help give them the emotional boost they need to start to feel better.</p>
<p><strong>What kids say about K’Bro</strong></p>
<p><i>It's a great app that helps kids who suffer with family, school, and daily issues and it comes with an addictingly fun mini game.</i></p>
<p><i>I found this to be a fun, addicting game!</i></p>
<p><i>It helps you get through tough times, and keeps your parents off your back with their checking in daily.</i></p>
<p><i>A game that lets you ask questions that you wouldn't talk to your friends or parents about.</i></p>
<p><i>Important app about communication and how you feel.</i></p>
<p><i>A good way to help you feel better or just try to get friends to beat my score.</i></p>
<p><strong>What parents say about K’Bro</strong></p>
<p><i>As a parent, I would pay any amount of money for my child's health &amp; happiness.</i></p>
<p><i>Emotional health and resiliency in my teens is very important to me – I’d pay even more to ensure that for my children.</i></p>
<p><i>It would be good for my child to be more aware of his feelings and options and to get support from sources other than his parents.</i></p>
<p><i>If my child would use it, I see benefits from it. Teens can be oppositional, especially if the recommendation is coming from their parent.</i></p>
<p><i>Kids need avenues to freely express themselves without being judged or supervised by a parent. It sounds like this would be a great vehicle for kids to be honest with themselves and gain better self-awareness.</i></p>

<p>Emotional resiliency is all about being able to bounce back when things get tough. We can’t stop our kids from experiencing stressors, but we can teach them the tools to successfully navigate their increasingly complex lives.  K’Bro’s mindfulness-based check-ins help youth learn to identify, express, and regulate their emotions in a healthy way.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Childhood mental disorders that alter the way children learn, behave and cope with their emotions affect 13% to 20% of youths under age 18, according to the CDC. They also cost families and society at large an estimated $247 billion a year in treatment, special education, juvenile justice and decreased productivity.</p>
<p>While the prevalence, early onset and impact on society make childhood mental problems a major public health issue, only 21% of affected children actually get treatment because of a national shortage of pediatric subspecialists and child and adolescent psychiatrists, according to the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry.</p>
<p>Suicide and substance abuse are on the rise.   Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. with boys ages 10 to 14 showing the 2<sup>nd</sup> highest increase in suicide rates.   Suicide is a cry for help that is often heard too late to be helpful.   While we now that people inherit a predisposition towards addition, neuroscience has found that it is extremely common for people with addictions to have a reduced capacity for dealing with emotional distress because somewhere along the way, they either didn’t develop or due to trauma lost their emotional resiliency.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, fewer medical students are specializing in children’s mental health careers, while the current crop of professionals are aging out of the workforce. The dearth of providers means troubled youngsters in underserved rural and urban areas are less likely to get timely care.</p>
<p>THE VOID:   Of the approximately 35 million children ages 9 to 17, 21 percent, or more than 7 million, have a diagnosable mental or addictive disorder that causes at least minimal impairment <i>and don’t receive treatment. </i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge to K'Bro is building a large enough database to tune the data model to accurately report a child's status on the Am I OK? index and to provide the most insightful conversation starter tips for parents.   Deep learning and semantic analysis - aspects of artificial intelligence - are quite mature as a technology and K'Bro is being advised by technological leaders in this space.   The more data is added the more accurate the index becomes.   K'Bro will work with ""gold standard"" assessment tools until we have achieved the reliability to meet validity standards.  The app has beneficial aspects to youth without the index but the index is critical to the parent subscription.  The challenge is a ""when"" problem, not an ""if"" problem.</p>

Suicide and substance abuse are on the rise.   Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. with boys ages 10 to 14 showing the 2nd highest increase in suicide rates.   Suicide is a cry for help that is often heard too late to be helpful.   While we now that people inherit a predisposition towards addition, neuroscience has found that it is extremely common for people with addictions to have a reduced capacity for dealing with emotional distress because somewhere along the way, they either didn’t develop or due to trauma lost their emotional resiliency.
Making matters worse, fewer medical students are specializing in children’s mental health careers, while the current crop of professionals are aging out of the workforce. The dearth of providers means troubled youngsters in underserved rural and urban areas are less likely to get timely care.
THE VOID:   Of the approximately 35 million children ages 9 to 17, 21 percent, or more than 7 million, have a diagnosable mental or addictive disorder that causes at least minimal impairment and don’t receive treatment. 

Risks & Challenges
The main challenge to K'Bro is building a large enough database to tune the data model to accurately report a child's status on the Am I OK? index and to provide the most insightful conversation starter tips for parents.   Deep learning and semantic analysis - aspects of artificial intelligence - are quite mature as a technology and K'Bro is being advised by technological leaders in this space.   The more data is added the more accurate the index becomes.   K'Bro will work with ""gold standard"" assessment tools until we have achieved the reliability to meet validity standards.  The app has beneficial aspects to youth without the index but the index is critical to the parent subscription.  The challenge is a ""when"" problem, not an ""if"" problem.

<li>We've already invested hundreds and hundreds or working hours in game design and development.</li>
<li>The core game mechanics are defined, and the world is set up and designed, lacking only a finishing polish.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Crowdfunding Campaign</strong></p><ul>
<li>The campaign will run until end of March.</li>
<li>It will provide us with enough funding to finish setting up the server infrastructure, correcting plenty of bugs beforehand, and hopefully allow us to go even further and include more content and features earlier – see the ""Stretch Goals"" section.</li>

<li>We plan to launch <font style=""color:#ff6e0e;""><i><b>AQUARYOUNS </b>World</i></font> as a Closed Alpha version in the second quarter of 2019.</li>
<li>The ALPHA version will include:<ul>
<li>21 different departments (some lacking part of their functionality)</li>
<li>11 different resources</li>
<li>blueprint system</li>
<li>GISMO HUD</li>
<li>civilization profile with 2D avatar (Aquaryoun)</li>
<li>messaging system</li>
<li>bug report system</li>
<li>feedback module</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the ALPHA phase, very regular (up to daily) updates will be deployed that may affect all game aspects (game-play, UI and design, infrastructure,...).</li>
<li>This is when we need your feedback and constructive ideas most!</li>

<li>As soon as the Closed ALPHA passes the first tests and everything runs smoothly, we'll proceed to the Closed BETA phase, probably at some point in the third or fourth quarter of the year.</li>
<li>Throughout the entire BETA phase, we'll provide regular major and minor updates with new features and bugfixes. At the same time, we'll slowly start the development of the next <font style=""color:#ff6e0e;""><i><b>AQUARYOUNS </b></i></font>games.</li>
<li>All unlocked Stretch Goals will be integrated during the BETA phase.</li>
<li>Towards the end of the year, we'll open up access to the entire world (Open BETA).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Release Candidate</strong></p><ul>
<li>We don't want to make any promises for when <font style=""color:#ff6e0e;""><i><b>AQUARYOUNS </b>World</i></font> will be released for good, since it strongly depends on the scope of the game, which in turn depends on how many Stretch Goals we'll achieve and how many new features will be requested by the community during the ALPHA and BETA phases.</li>

All in-game views shown on this site are PreALPHA status.AQUARYOUNS World is a 3D online strategy and business simulation game and will set the focus on economic activity.You starts as AQUARYOUN and leads his human civilization to glory and honor.The underwater world on planet Earth is divided into different Zones with different environmental conditions, such as average temparature, current, algae growth, ...(Different zones with different environmental conditions)In each zone, humanity has marked hexagonal Plateaus for colonization. Neighbouring Plateaus are grouped in Clusters, and each Plateau is subdivided into 61 hexagonal Claims, which serve as basic cells for department construction.(hexagonal claim on a plateau, preALPHA)(Plateau Design 2.0)You start with a single control center on one single Claim in the corner of a Plateau...(Control Center, preALPHA)...steadily building up your economy, spreading your influence on other Claims and trying to dominate the entire Plateau.(Animation Department Building, Plateau Design 1.0, preALPHA)You have to create complex economic cycles with factories to produce resources and process them into goods to create ships.(Pioneer Ship, preALPHA)(Factory with Guppy Ship, preALPHA)The depth of the economic levels within AQUARYOUNS World will increase from time to time. We want to make a game for the arcade gamer, but for experienced economy gamers, too.(View over the plateau, Plateau Design 1.0, preALPHA)Beware of the other players and the NPC enemy that is already strengthening its economy in the same Plateau! As soon as you hold control of your Plateau, you will probably start wondering where to go next.You can enter a specially created control room to see your influence growing. It contains a strategy table to show you all plateaus of the current zone as well as a detailed map of the selected plateau cluster as a hologram projection. This projection shows you the current diplomatic relations, available resources and current events.(Tour control room, preALPHA)AQUARYOUNS World' intelligent placement algorithm aligns the in-game spatial distances with the real-world geography. In combination with a location-based day/night-cycle, this will help you experience AQUARYOUNS World as a future version of our Earth instead of some random ocean planet.Although AQUARYOUNS World is a online game, it will contain a classic DEMO mode in which players can taste the AQUARYOUNS World feeling. The DEMO mode will be playable without any registration. If the player thinks he is ready for the complete AQUARYOUNS World experience, he will have to sign up. This will push his current stage of the game (single player) to the server (multiplayer).(Login Screen with DEMO Mode, preALPHA)AQUARYOUNS will allow you to individualize the appearance of your avatar and civilization!Custom textures, own colors, modifications for the 3D models of your ships, special logos and non-standard naming or your graffiti on your Claims.Let your imagination run wild!Perform research in your labs and even discover new and unknown raw materials by combining resources with different attributes and name any material that you were the first to discover!(comes with Stretch Goal ""Research System"") In the distant future, when climate change, tectonic activity and human experiments have caused the sea level to rise beyond all expectations and continents on earth have ceased to exist.Humanity has learned to live underwater in the shallow regions of the one global ocean.Nobody knows the secrets deep down in the ocean! Discover unknown areas and ...... find out what Nepû means.... get in touch with the Wæ,krÿs and learn why everyone thinks they are decended from wandering and businesses-making greed.... discover what space actually has to do with our world ocean.AQUARYOUNS World will come with more than 21 departments in detailed 3D optic.(Harbor, preALPHA)Build recycler to prevent an ecological catastrophe and to reclaim resources from the rubbish of your civilization. Or create a mighty trade empire by exchanging goods on the stock market for the universal in-game currency ""Prions"" (not to be confused with ""Qurons"" which are used to buy customization and individualization).(Selection of more than 21 buildable departments, preALPHA)Each one of the more than 21 departments provides his own inventory and business feature.(Department HUD for Research, preALPHA)(Department HUD for Generic Factory/Smelter, preALPHA)In the large and detailed encyclopedia of AQUARYOUNS you will find information about each department.(Encyclopedia HUD, preALPHA)More than 6 ship classes will be available in AQUARYOUNS World.Each class is based on a default model. You have the opportunity to customize...
the weapons,
the engines,
the armor...
by adding or replacing individual modules. Or you want to change a ship to a ground vehicle? With this hugh range of possibilities you can...
build pioneer ships and travel to other Plateaus, distant Clusters or even a complete different Zone. Land there and start working on another control center to spread your people and your influence.
make war with other players and beat your enemy to the seabed with a mighty submarine army.
train special ground units and troops to infiltrate your opponents' vessels and departments.
(Concept Arts Ships/Ship Classes)(Concept Arts modularization of two ship classes)AQUARYOUNS World comes with a minimalistic HUD interface, so that nothing will stop you from getting lost in its underwater world.(Ingame HUD, Plateau Design 1.0, preALPHA)Our Global Identification, Selection & Moving Object, short ""GISMO""...(GISMO presentation of all layers, preALPHA)... is a single button that presents you with an arc-shaped context menu. The possible options vary with the selected elements (department, unit, terrain, …).AQUARYOUNS World will initially be published in English and German with further languages to come as the game spreads around the globe.You will be able to play AQUARYOUNS anytime, anywhere. After the Start of the EarlyAccess AQUARYOUNS is available on STEAM. Or simply open http://aquaryouns.games in your browser, desktop or mobile, and dive under!We are also going to release AQUARYOUNS for Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Windows Store and Consoles as soon as possible.AQUARYOUNS World is only one game of a series of AQUARYOUNS games, multiple games - all placed int one universe.But what do we mean with ""One Universe"" and ""Multiple Games""?And what the hell is AQUARYOUNS?We don't mean a game that is strategy and RPG, tetris-like and business simulation, point-and-click adventure and MOBA, all at the same time.No. We don't.We wouldn't want to play such a game. We mean several games of different genres that share the same world data!What if......you could let your RPG character stroll right through the department block that you've built in your business simulation this very morning?...your 5-minute mobile arcade game in the bus could boost the productivity of the factories in your business simulation?...the war that your alliance started changed the point-and-click adventures all over the world – forever?...you fought this war yourself in a MOBA game, affecting the outcome of a battle in the main strategy game? Think ofas a complete big game world which will only work fine with more than one separate AQUARYOUNS game. We see all games in the AQUARYOUNS universe as singles released from the big music album ""AQUARYOUNS"" .This principle of many games sharing the same world is one of the heart of AQUARYOUNS!The AQUARYOUNS games will not only share the same timeline, ALL games will interact with each other. That means the data of an AQUARYOUNS World player will be shared with another AQUARYOUNS game in real time.Everything is connected and live.Let's try a thought experiment:Assume that you are playing an AQUARYOUNS point-and-click adventure. You discover an interesting department in the AQUARYOUNS universe. Finding some quests and items, speaking with people or interacting with a certain room.Suddenly everything changes around you. Your dialogue partner flees, the room is shaking, all lights turn to red. You want to know what's going on?You switch the room and see that the whole department is deserted. After finding the control panel you notice the cause: The claim and the department is under attack (triggered through an action in in another AQUARYOUNS game).Now you have to choose:Leave the department and the claim as soon as possible or join the defence. At the same time a player of AQUARYOUNS World receives the ""department under attack"" message. He'll see, that his building is under attack from an enemy player. He has to organize a defence and order support to the location.Now both players, one in AQUARYOUNS World and another one in AQUARYOUNS Point-And-Click-Adventure, try to defend the same department although they play different AQUARYOUNS  games. That describes the heart of AQUARYOUNS:All games share the same universe at the same time.Our greatest goal is to make the exciting vision of the legendary AQUARYOUNS universe available to all prospective seafarers.It must not be, that the size of anyones Quron-wallet* decides if he or she can dive in or has to stay on land. AQUARYOUNS is not a sealed off underwater-area on our mother earth.Everyone, whether big or small, should be able to experience AQUARYOUNS!So we want to release some AQUARYOUNS games free to play. For us this also includes free content updates.However we are just a small studio that needs a budget to continue working too.In this case we have to find a fair way between undisturbed game pleasure and getting a budget. Creating the best possible AQUARYOUNS-experience with a low-budget development process (and hopefully an active community of players and fans to guide the way) requires compromises.One of these compromises will be that we won't release all these games all at the same time. We'll start with AQUARYOUNS World.* Qurons are our ingame currencyOnce AQUARYOUNS World has hatched from its EarlyAccess phase, we plan to launch AQUARYOUNS Arena soon after.AQUARYOUNS Arena is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game, featuring 1-vs-1 and group-vs-group battles. A single Plateau serves as the arena for epic and action-packed battles that determine the outcome of the wars in AQUARYOUNS World.A tetris-like / casual / arcade game for your 5-minutes-waiting-for-the-bus or the 15 minutes before you really turn off the PC and go to bed. Each game directly impacts the productivity of a factory in AQUARYOUNS World.Compare your scores in local, regional and global leaderboards and become the best factory manager on earth!A collection of exciting point-and-click adventures, set in the AQUARYOUNS underwater stage.Visit your own Claim from AQUARYOUNS World or travel the entire ocean! Take on quests, gather items, and find out why Earth looks the way it does in the AQUARYOUNS game world!Our greatest wish is to gather an active and strong community of players!One of the reasons for launching this campaign in the first place.Naturally, an Online Game like AQUARYOUNS needs many players to be fun. This makes Crowdfunding the perfect platform both for collecting the funding needed for the final development spurt and for gathering a great initial player community!The more of you sign up for EarlyAcces and the more of you spread the word, the better a gaming experience AQUARYOUNS will become!You can help. NOW! 

























 Please register on our website https://www.aquaryouns.com as well!After sign-up, you'll also get a unique sharing link to refer your friends to - and for every friend that signs up using this link, you earn points which translate to in-game Qurons!Until now
We've already invested hundreds and hundreds or working hours in game design and development.
The core game mechanics are defined, and the world is set up and designed, lacking only a finishing polish.
Crowdfunding Campaign
The campaign will run until end of March.
It will provide us with enough funding to finish setting up the server infrastructure, correcting plenty of bugs beforehand, and hopefully allow us to go even further and include more content and features earlier – see the ""Stretch Goals"" section.
ALPHA
Pledge on the ""Pioneer"" tier or above in order to be one of AQUARYOUNS ""First Pioneers"" that prepare the ocean floor for human civilization!
We plan to launch AQUARYOUNS World as a Closed Alpha version in the second quarter of 2019.
The ALPHA version will include:
21 different departments (some lacking part of their functionality)
11 different resources
blueprint system
GISMO HUD
civilization profile with 2D avatar (Aquaryoun)
messaging system
bug report system
feedback module


During the ALPHA phase, very regular (up to daily) updates will be deployed that may affect all game aspects (game-play, UI and design, infrastructure,...).
This is when we need your feedback and constructive ideas most!
BETA
Pledge on the smallest level or apply on our Website https://www.aquarouns.com for access to the Closed BETA!
As soon as the Closed ALPHA passes the first tests and everything runs smoothly, we'll proceed to the Closed BETA phase, probably at some point in the third or fourth quarter of the year.
Throughout the entire BETA phase, we'll provide regular major and minor updates with new features and bugfixes. At the same time, we'll slowly start the development of the next AQUARYOUNS games.
All unlocked Stretch Goals will be integrated during the BETA phase.
Towards the end of the year, we'll open up access to the entire world (Open BETA).
Release Candidate
We don't want to make any promises for when AQUARYOUNS World will be released for good, since it strongly depends on the scope of the game, which in turn depends on how many Stretch Goals we'll achieve and how many new features will be requested by the community during the ALPHA and BETA phases.
There is no end to development: AQUARYOUNS won't ever be a one-shot-finished-title, but a living and evolving world!
Most of the Stretch Goals represent additional modules that give variety and depth to the game and thus will enhance your gaming experience, ultimately increasing your fun with AQUARYOUNS!So, here's what you can help to unlock:DJAMACAT Gamesports, that are an enthusiastic team of eight Game Geeks, who want nothing less than to break the rules of the known gaming world.We combine more than 20 years development expertise with an extensive gaming practice and more than 5 years game business experience.

ALL TOGETHER defines the game mechanics!We all work hard every day to achieve the goal to present you, our community, our vision of an living AQUARYOUNS Universe.Eight geeks, well-chosen from the founder of DJAMACAT GmbH and creator of the original idea behind AQUARYOUNS:Tommy Müller, a well-kept mid-thirties with a long live career in software development. As a fan of the Westwood Studios and driven by the desire to present the world its own game world, he began writing his first own software at the age of 14.Now we have come together to bring the vision of AQUARYOUNS to live with the help of JAVA and Unity3D.We are extremely excited about this project. We hope that you are, too.So, go ahead and support this campaign! Now, it's up to you.",84.0,1,"1 Campaign

The reason why the amount is so high at $1500 is because the path we are taking to acquire this trademark is through an attorney. While we could do it ourselves or use a website to attempt this the problem this creates is a very high chance of our request being rejected. If it does get rejected it will cost more money and time to file it again. So in order to prevent this we are going to hire a professional to handle it to give us the greatest chance of success. I have already been in contact with a trademark attorney, but obviously can not commit to anything until the funds are raised. We have some money that i have invested personally in the organization but it is not nearly enough. I am willing to cover the difference if we get close to our goal as well. Any funds raised above the goal will be used to support our teams with travel costs, gear, etc. So we would love contributions from you and happily will give you some awesome perks for it!</p></div>","Thanks for stopping by!

If it does get rejected it will cost more money and time to file it again. So in order to prevent this we are going to hire a professional to handle it to give us the greatest chance of success. I have already been in contact with a trademark attorney, but obviously can not commit to anything until the funds are raised. We have some money that i have invested personally in the organization but it is not nearly enough. I am willing to cover the difference if we get close to our goal as well. Any funds raised above the goal will be used to support our teams with travel costs, gear, etc. So we would love contributions from you and happily will give you some awesome perks for it!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Way before Mafia Wars built thier copycat and made millions. I could never afford to fight them. They partnered with Facebook and took off into the sunset. I faught to keep the game relevant, keeping it thriving for years with thousands of supporters and chronic players. Until the Facebook games took over. The stand alone MafiaLife website platform could not survive the technology requirements to stay hot in the industry.<br/><br/>Had to fight again, and put ALL my life savings into a rebuild of the MafiaLife game, on the Facebook platform. I used my own money, and reinvested every penny, partnered with programmers and made it happen. The game stayed alive on Facebook, and starting growing fast again.

Way before Mafia Wars built thier copycat and made millions. I could never afford to fight them. They partnered with Facebook and took off into the sunset. I faught to keep the game relevant, keeping it thriving for years with thousands of supporters and chronic players. Until the Facebook games took over. The stand alone MafiaLife website platform could not survive the technology requirements to stay hot in the industry.Had to fight again, and put ALL my life savings into a rebuild of the MafiaLife game, on the Facebook platform. I used my own money, and reinvested every penny, partnered with programmers and made it happen. The game stayed alive on Facebook, and starting growing fast again.

<p>Hi everyone, I’m
a developer from South Africa who for the most part develops SQL / C# solutions
for a living. Ever since I was a kid I always
said I’m going to write a game one day when around one year ago I decided to
tick it off my bucket list, started teaching myself and developing part time.</p>
<p>I know I probably should have started
off with a simple single player game for my first attempt but I don’t really
play much single player games and really couldn’t relate to it so here we are…</p>
<p>Clash started off as a LAN game but
after some thought and discovering some great new break troughs in the
development community I realized that with not much changes I will be able to
turn Clash into a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena.</p>
<p>I’m very passionate about game development
and should Clash be successful it could be the start of more titles and even
the start of a Game Studio in South Africa which is in short supply. </p>

We thought it was time to take another look, and we realized that this time all of the inter-active power of the internet could make our game a truly unique experience.</b></span><div>
<b></b><p><b></b><br/></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">This is a game about what it takes to put a movie together in Tinseltown. Rather than explain in detail how the game works, I think I'll allow The Wall Street Journal to have the honors, just as they did when the game was originally released.</p>
<p>Excerpt below:</p>
<p>""The object of the movie game is to become the first player to make a film, get three foreign distributors and reach the screen. But to make the movie, a player has to pay dearly for a writer ($250,000), producer ($500,000), director ($750,000), and star ($1 million). The final ingredient, a studio deal comes free.</p>
<p>In moving around the Monopoly-like game board (via dice and game cards), players collect money ranging from $50,000 as a minor reward, up to $200,000 for a major network television deal. But they also have to ante up $25,000 in legal fees or 20% of all cash in hand for a ""personal manager fee"".</p>
<p>Along the way, the budding movie moguls attend countless meetings, just like their real-life counterparts. Says one meeting card: ""Your meeting is at the altar, where you marry into an old Hollywood family; go to the square of your choice.""</p>

</div>","Introducing: THE MOVIE GAME™

The Movie Game (TMG) is ready-to-publish and challenge the imagination of gamers worldwide! 
With your help we are launching what could become a part of the next big wave in family board gaming.  TMG is designed for players ages 14 to adult and bridges the gap between classic board games and the mobile game space by connecting them together in a highly innovative and unique way.             

Our new board game builds on the success of the original 1981 TMG classic that launched coast-to-coast and sold out in over 500 stores, plus captured the attention of The Wall Street Journal.          
""The Movie Game™ combines the best of both gaming worlds by embracing classic board game play features where friends and family come together in their own living rooms... connected with the power of Net/Boarding™ that literally brings our new board game to life.""




About ""The Movie Game""TMG sold out in over 500 department stores when first published in 1981. We thought it was time to take another look, and we realized that this time all of the inter-active power of the internet could make our game a truly unique experience.

This is a game about what it takes to put a movie together in Tinseltown. Rather than explain in detail how the game works, I think I'll allow The Wall Street Journal to have the honors, just as they did when the game was originally released.
Excerpt below:
""The object of the movie game is to become the first player to make a film, get three foreign distributors and reach the screen. But to make the movie, a player has to pay dearly for a writer ($250,000), producer ($500,000), director ($750,000), and star ($1 million). The final ingredient, a studio deal comes free.
In moving around the Monopoly-like game board (via dice and game cards), players collect money ranging from $50,000 as a minor reward, up to $200,000 for a major network television deal. But they also have to ante up $25,000 in legal fees or 20% of all cash in hand for a ""personal manager fee"".
Along the way, the budding movie moguls attend countless meetings, just like their real-life counterparts. Says one meeting card: ""Your meeting is at the altar, where you marry into an old Hollywood family; go to the square of your choice.""




   


Imagine playing TMG at home, rolling the dice... and then being connected to a Hollywood Celebrity! 
Or on your next play, winning a TMG guest pass to see your favorite movie. 
Or, (if the film biz is your thing), winning a personalized face-to-face Skype call with an experienced casting executive, or special effects creator, or well known writer, producer or director. 
Or, if you have a Smartphone... uploading your TMG audition while playing the board game, and then TMG players around the world ""liking"" your performance. 

Or being rewarded for watching a movie trailer on your cell phone.   And better yet, our list keeps on growing because imagination is really just the beginning.



  
However, you don't have to be in show biz to play or win The Movie Game.  The movie game is NOT a trivia game and that’s what makes our game come alive for every player. 
It's your choice with every roll of the dice; play the classic board game or mix it up and connect with www.TheMovieGame.com to test your luck and skills. So why not have your own ""Movie Game Party"" and invite your friends to play the game.  For your first game we'll even supply the popcorn if you invite the players! Just use the special QR code in your game to register!  It's all part of The Movie Game’s magical portal experience with your exclusive connection to TheMovieGame.com and our ability to capture players ""live"" using our Net/Boarding™ play features.
                       



  

Things we think you should know about our company and the board game industry:

Today, the board game business is on a roll with five consecutive years of double digit growth publishing 30 million board games each year with nearly $2 billion in annual sales. Another real growth industry is the mobile game business with 2015 sales of $31 billion and projected growth to over $40 billion by 2017. 
Did you know... ""The board game business is booming!""



Lester Holt with NBC NEWS says...""The ""Golden Age of Games"" is what they're calling it!  People are turning off their cell phones and putting away their iPads to reconnect on a human level, and it's board games leading the charge to fill that void.""  {click to watch the Lester Holt NBC News Report} 

Special Perks - Early bird supporters receive a 33% discount per game! Plus, TMG players are eligible for film fan rewards too!

A personal note from Frank


And The Movie Game was born!
It has taken thousands of work hours to achieve the results we wanted. In this regard, The Movie Game™ is NOT a trivia game.  We are a real life wheeling/dealing fast paced roll-the-dice game best described word for word below by The Wall Street Journal.
Remember, we’ve tested the market and we've analyzed the market, and we know what's trending.  And now, we’re ready to stake our own claim with one foot in the board game business
and the other in the mobile game arena. Together, (with your help) we are ready to take the next evolutionary steps. 
Today, an amazing 34 years later, we are here to share with you the new
design and innovative game play features
that only the newest streaming technology has made possible.  Our new Net/Boarding™
connectivity and 2015 version of TMG is a state-of-the-art board game product with features
that enable players to be a part of the real Hollywood by making their
own dreams come true.  
Our excitement
is genuine and we are ready to manufacture in the USA using the highest standards, and a manufacturer with more than five decades of experience making board games.  And to get the ball rolling, we are offering a limited number of games to our first early bird supporters at a significant 33% pre-order discount for helping us rev up the production
engines.  In this regard, our game will
retail for $74.95 plus shipping and handling. Early supporters save $25 dollars per game
ordered with pre-Holiday 2015 deliveries now being scheduled. Once our crowd funding campaign starts (Tuesday, August 18th), you will have a limited number of days to get in on the first publishing run to print before the Holidays. Remember, you can only become a TMG Club Member if you own and register the game.  As our game will be exclusive to purchase directly from us, orders placed during the campaign will be fulfilled on a first come basis through to the end of the year.
Thank you for your support!
In this regard, now is the time for you to take a
few minutes to screen our ""TMG Presents"" video (click this link) and then get ready to ""Take a meeting"" with our creator Frank Sacks"", In this 3 minute behind-the-scenes video he'll give you a Sneak Preview of The Movie Game and share his personal story with a few fun surprises along the way. 
Check out our game plan and our anything-but-ordinary perks and our unique track record for making successful feature films, and turning books and games (including two of the books below that Frank wrote and produced) into feature films for HBO and Columbia. Extreme Justice & Nico the Unicorn have combined views on YouTube now totaling more than one million.

By supporting us
today, you will become part of The Movie Game's founder community and a part of the global opportunity to take the next step in the board game renaissance and The
Movie Game’s box office success.
  
""The Movie Game"" board game will provide every person who has ever dreamed of making it big in Tinseltown the opportunity to realize that goal… but that’s only half the story, or in this case, half the game. The 2015 updated Net/Boarding™  version gives each player landing on a “Movie Game” square the chance to use a smartphone and capture the “QR” bar code printed on a special TMG game card.
Once connected, this moment could become the most memorable event in a player’s life as our server harnesses the power of connecting every registered TMG player with the desire of Hollywood to build a bridge to each player.
For example, a player could watch a new film
trailer and be rewarded with (for example) an AMC theatre pass.  Or, a year’s free subscription to Netflix, or, a player might be asked to read lines
from a movie script, all of it captured on your smartphone for other players worldwide to vote on how you did!  The best
players will win select prizes, or pick up a bonus that advances them further
along the game board.   
As we grow, our broadcast studio at www.TheMovieGame.com will expand and who knows where imagination will take us, maybe we'll get MTV to move over and make room for  a newcomer.  If not, that's OK as we don't need anyone else's permission to have our own internet TMG broadcasting channel. The fact is... audiences are leaving the TV world and shifting their entertainment preferences to what's showing on the Net.  And that's precisely where we want to be with our own broadcasting channelled through TheMovieGame.com and your Net/Boarding™ connected board game.  On our channel you (the TMG Club Member and player) can be both an audience and a broadcaster.  Why wait to be discovered when we can put your future in your own hands to make your dreams come true. 
 

And who hasn't dreamed of making it big in
Hollywood?
That's why we think TMG will appeal
to so many people!  In fact, of the 1.5 billion members of FaceBook, 375 million say they love games!  We get it.  We also get that every person on the planet who owns a Smartphone (and we are talking about billions of people), all have in their pocket the ability to shoot HD films 24/7.  TMG wants to reach out and give each one of you that buys the game or becomes a TMG Club Member or registered player, a way for us to bring Hollywood to you. Forget about having to go to LA, you've now got the power to be a movie game winner no matter where you live.
For those outside the industry, I promise
you'll learn a lot about the real Hollywood and how movies get made, while
having a great time playing this game as we connect you with TMG's community of players from around the world. 
Whether you've
""Been there and done that"" or always wondered, ""What if?"",
you're going to have a blast with your family and friends when you play The
Movie Game as it comes alive and gives you the chance to make your own dreams
come true!                                                         
                                                             TIMELINE





        





Risks & Challenges

We've already got a great classic game to build upon and learned from our initial release what the best distribution pattern is for the game.  In other words, we are bypassing the congested retail/wholesale toy scheme and shipping to our players direct.  That's why we've aligned ourselves with the best game manufacturing/fulfillment company in the country.  They can make and ship one game or one hundred thousand games. They've been doing just that for over fifty years.  In addition, we've got the advantage of already having test marketed our classic game with terrific reviews, lots of great press coverage and the best results as the original game sold out in over 500 stores coast-to-coast.  
Shipping first class direct to our players is the way to go even if there's a premium to pay UPS/Fedex who are our exclusive carriers.  This is especially important for those that want to give the game as a Holiday gift.  By taking control of our own destiny we expect nothing less than the best practices in terms of our product and your customer satisfaction.  Our ""guarantee"" is backed by our ""A+"" Better Business Bureau rating to make good on our promises to you (our supporters) and to our future TMG players and Club Members. 

Don't forget to check out our videos, especially our {TMG Sneak Preview - TMG Presents} as we have lot's more to show and tell but couldn't possibly squeeze all those graphics, videos and campaign details onto this one page!

<p><b>What is Card Arcade (the previous title)?</b> </p>
<p>Currently available on both Windows 8/10 and Windows Phone, not using a specific game engine, this game is coded natively for these platforms. The game has been highly popular and featured on several Windows and Windows Phone tech sites during it's time in the stores. We have received a lot of positive feedback that has lead us to pursue a follow up title to the game, Card Arcade 3D. The current game offers players several games including Memory, Blackjack, Go Fish, War, Karma and Old Maid. </p>
<p><b>What is Card Arcade 3D?</b> </p>
<p>Following up on the success of Card Arcade, work has begun on Card Arcade 3D. The game is using the Unity3D game engine and is being planned for release on Steam, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The game carries on the same theme of the previous game, a hub full of different card games. The game is set to include the same card games seen in the previous version with many improvements, but is also set to include many additional games depending on funding levels reached. </p>
<p><b>What new games will be included if funding is received?</b> </p>
<p>On top of the existing games being remade for the new version, we will be including: </p>
<p>- Canasta <br/>- A variation of Skip-Bo <br/>- A variation of Phase-10 <br/>+ more..</p>
<p><b>What makes Card Arcade different/special?</b> </p>
<p>There is currently nothing of this scale available that is cross platform. We plan to make some of the games playable multiplayer across a Wi-Fi network and online, across platforms (with the exception of Xbox One and PS4 not being cross platform). Our goal is to make a game you can pick up and play solo or play any of your friends, without worrying about what OS they are running on their phone. </p>
<p>Unlike any other titles currently available, we also aim to make your Card Arcade 3D stats and game progress sync across devices (again with the exception of Xbox One and PS4). Start your game on your phone and then pick up game progress on your tablet or pc. </p>
<p><b>What is the timeframe for the game?</b> </p>
<p>Providing we don't come across any platform specific hurdles, we are aiming for a December release date for the game. </p>
<p><b>Why Indiegogo?</b> </p>
<p>Game development is a costly venture including game assets/resources and development time. Card Arcade 3D takes our games to a whole new level and we want to make sure we can do it right! </p>
<p>Having this project on Indiegogo allows us to raise funds we can put directly back in to game development. The more funds we raise, the more games and game modes we can include in the initial release. The funding will also allow us to purchase additional development hardware and testing hardware to help us polish the game and ensure it is well tested before it's release. </p>
<p><b>Why are you not asking for much funding?</b></p>
<p>Card Arcade 3D has just started being developed. As such, the funding goal we have set is the minimum we ideally require to help us obtain some additional development and testing hardware for the game. We are however going to be setting stretch goals throughout the campaign, with more game content being added for each stretch goal, both on launch and after launch in DLC packs. Funding levels will also have an impact on what games will receive online play capabilities.</p>
<p><b>About Us</b> </p>
<p>We are an Australian software development business. We've published several self published titles and some third party titles. Our self published titles (primarily Card Arcade &amp; Wheel of Wealth) have built up close to 700,000 downloads and maintain a 4+ average star rating. </p>

Now there is an easier way to take advantage of all the information you have access to, including unstructured data.  
Websheets simplifies working with Big Data.  Use familiar spreadsheet skills to harness new technology to overcome the data limits of traditional spreadsheets. You can now manipulate and analyze billions, even trillions, of records in milliseconds.  Websheets allows you to use big data technology like Hadoop, Spark and social (graph) databases without having to learn new skills.  
Websheets converts traditional spreadsheet formulas into elastic computations that auto-distribute across all allocated servers to allow you to do what you need to do without data limits.  
Big data is
“the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity”.  
This reality and my firsthand exposure to helping organizations wrangle their growing amount of data inspired me to create Websheets.  Too much money and time is spent relating data to disparate sources, cleaning up data, and trying to overcome the limits of traditional spreadsheets.  There's no surprise that the number of data scientists and big data professionals will not keep pace with demand.  
To date, I have a working prototype. But I'm ready to take the product to the next level.  I need your help to offer The Easy Way to Big Data.  
Conceptually, here's how it works:


Here's how you can help:
 
1. Get involved. If you want to flatten the technology playing field, contact me on how you can help.
2. Donate. Help me prove to investors this is a worthy cause.
It’s time for a new spreadsheet. Help me give the world tools to make a better world. It’s time for Websheets.   Make Your Voice Count Even Exponential Organizations need fuel to light fire.  Right now, I'm a one man show (and a lousy dancer).  If you can't share you're talent, make a difference by showing investors that there is a need.  Show them you understand where the world is headed and want to be prepare.  
To get involved, email info@websheet.io.  To voice your interest, donate here.  
    Risks & Challenges The greatest risk I see is that people don't know what they don't know (go figure). We are 1% of the way through the Information Revolution (source). Things are about to heat up.  How informed and prepared are you?  Do you think traditional vendors will sell you the tools to succeed or keep you on the upgrade train, stifling your organizational agility and competitiveness?
Yes, there are risks and challenges!  But not addressing the oncoming risks and challenges is even worse.  
Here's are next steps:

Over this month, I will consider suggestions on incentives.
Take ideas on revenue strategies. My strategy is solid. But your ideas might also help fuel funding continual development of a free product.

<p>Dear friends, my name is <b>Kim Chulmin (a.k.a. KCM)</b>. I have been casting matches between professional gamers, mostly on Korean television, since 2001. The <b>Starcraft: Brood War (SC:BW)</b> fans among you may remember me mostly from broadcasts of the MBC Starcraft League (MSL), on which I appeared from its inception to its end. Some of you may better know me from my work as a caster for Starcraft II leagues on SPO TV and OGN.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459885398/%ED%83%90%ED%8F%AC%EB%93%9C_jx6nam.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What is this project?</h3>
<p>In recent months, I have organized and broadcast the <b>KCM Legend Match (a.k.a. KLM)</b>, an event in which three teams of SC:BW pro gamers compete weekly for prizes. So far, I have at times used a combination of my own funds, small sponsorships, and fan donations to pay for the cost of past KLMs.</p>
<p>These matches had exceptional production values, with a casting team composed of myself and similarly-experienced commentators (Kim Carry, Yooi, and Zeus appeared in recent weeks) broadcasting from a studio with staff support. Also, we were able to take advantage of multiple broadcasting platforms that are more accessible to the international audience such as Youtube and Twitch. Recently, we were even able to have the matches simultaneously broadcast in both Korean (<a href=""http://www.afreeca.com/cjfals28"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link</a>) and English (<a href=""http://www.twitch.tv/gtr1h"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link</a>). English-language information about these past matches can be found on Liquipedia (<a href=""http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/KCM_Legend_Match"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link</a>). VODs can be found on my YouTube channel (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ja61Zku_rw3ZBfDZi8cuQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link</a>).</p>
<p>I hope that you have enjoyed these KLMs and would like to see more of them. <b>This is where you come in!</b> I need your help to continue funding these weekly KLMs.</p>
<h3>What is the goal of this project?</h3>
<p>My <b>immediate goal</b> is to fund the next few KLMs with the help of the international Starcraft community. However, my <b>ultimate goal</b> is to increase the chances of securing sponsorship deals for SC:BW events in the future by demonstrating that grassroots passion for Brood War is alive and well on a global scale. You have the chance to help improve the perception of SC:BW in the board rooms of Korean corporations.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>100% percent of your donations will go toward prize money</b> for the pro gamers taking part in the KLMs. The cost of an extra week of KLMs is $1000 USD. This means that, if we raise $3409 USD, then $3000 will be used to pay the pro gamers for three more weeks of KLMs and the remaining $409 will be used to reward the gamers for achieving consecutive wins.</p>
<h3>Who will be competing?</h3>
<p>Here is a partial list of players who have participated in the KCM Legend Matches so far. While we cannot guarantee their participation, past history has demonstrated their willingness to participate barring any conflicts. Other players may also become available as time goes on. This list includes several former champions of major tournaments as well as elite players who were regulars in the finals and semifinals of such events.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Terran:</b> Mind (""The Poisonous Viper""), HiyA (""Magikarp""), Iris (""Berserker""), NaDa (""Genius""), Sea (""l'enfant terrible""), sSak (""Big Head""), Piano (""The Specialist""), Mong (""Honey and Chip""), Last (""half-half""), Light (""The Invisible Terran""), Sharp (""Earnest Jo"")
</li>
<li>
<b>Zerg:</b> EffOrt (""Immortal Phoenix""), ZerO (""The Little Prince""), hero (""Bisu Killer""), July (""Battle God""), Kwanro (""All-in Bong""), Larva (""Pong-pong Zerg"")</li>
<li>
<b>Protoss:</b> free (""Lightning Emperor""), Shuttle (""Capitalist Monster""), Guemchi (""Oh-my-eyes""), BeSt (""Behemoth""), Movie (""Movie Star""), Tyson (""BS""), Zeus (""Safety-first Protoss"")</li>
</ul>
<h3>""Race Survival"" Format (Details)</h3>
<p>Every week, three teams (Terran, Zerg, Protoss) will compete. Each team has three players. Every week, the players will be selected based on recent results and other factors. The team that was victorious in the previous week returns all of its members and gets an opportunity to win again.</p>
<p>Each team will send out a player as its representative. When a player loses, he is eliminated from that week's competition. The teams will continue sending out new players until they have no remaining players. In the end, only one team will have any players remaining. This team, the last team standing, will take home the prize money.</p>
<p>There is a <b>special perk</b> that will allow you, the fan, to participate in the team selection process. If you contribute an amount that corresponds to this perk, you may nominate a player of your choice! You can even nominate your favorite non-Korean player from Hungary, Poland, China, or any country with a solid internet connection to Korea! If your first choice is not available, then you can nominate a second choice, a third choice, and so on.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone might be in a situation to contribute financially. However, there are many other ways for you to help us as well. You can help get the word out by word-of-mouth and social media. Indiegogo share tools can also be used to send information about the campaign to your friends.</p></div>","Who am I?

Here is a partial list of players who have participated in the KCM Legend Matches so far. While we cannot guarantee their participation, past history has demonstrated their willingness to participate barring any conflicts. Other players may also become available as time goes on. This list includes several former champions of major tournaments as well as elite players who were regulars in the finals and semifinals of such events.


Terran: Mind (""The Poisonous Viper""), HiyA (""Magikarp""), Iris (""Berserker""), NaDa (""Genius""), Sea (""l'enfant terrible""), sSak (""Big Head""), Piano (""The Specialist""), Mong (""Honey and Chip""), Last (""half-half""), Light (""The Invisible Terran""), Sharp (""Earnest Jo"")


Zerg: EffOrt (""Immortal Phoenix""), ZerO (""The Little Prince""), hero (""Bisu Killer""), July (""Battle God""), Kwanro (""All-in Bong""), Larva (""Pong-pong Zerg"")

Protoss: free (""Lightning Emperor""), Shuttle (""Capitalist Monster""), Guemchi (""Oh-my-eyes""), BeSt (""Behemoth""), Movie (""Movie Star""), Tyson (""BS""), Zeus (""Safety-first Protoss"")

""Race Survival"" Format (Details)
Every week, three teams (Terran, Zerg, Protoss) will compete. Each team has three players. Every week, the players will be selected based on recent results and other factors. The team that was victorious in the previous week returns all of its members and gets an opportunity to win again.
Each team will send out a player as its representative. When a player loses, he is eliminated from that week's competition. The teams will continue sending out new players until they have no remaining players. In the end, only one team will have any players remaining. This team, the last team standing, will take home the prize money.
There is a special perk that will allow you, the fan, to participate in the team selection process. If you contribute an amount that corresponds to this perk, you may nominate a player of your choice! You can even nominate your favorite non-Korean player from Hungary, Poland, China, or any country with a solid internet connection to Korea! If your first choice is not available, then you can nominate a second choice, a third choice, and so on.

<b>Hi
everyone! <br/><br/>We are the team in the process of designing a new smartphone fitness
and gaming app unlike no other! We think our idea is really cool and we want to
share it with you and make you a part of it! <br/><br/>Endohumans</b> will be the first mobile App in the world to combine fitness/running tracking with an epic online game!<br/> <br/>So users will get a captivating adventurous storyline which, 
in order to proceed in, they 
will need to get on their feet and start exercising! <b><br/>
<br/></b>So, imagine you've just downloaded a new 
seemingly common smartphone fitness application  which like many others 
tracks your steps/runs/cycle rides and other workout info with the 
normal maps and musical playback... however this time something 
extraordinary happens!<b><br/><br/>
</b><p>This is not like any normal application! Soon you discover that your 
application has been ""intercepted"" and you are being communicated by the
 ""Endohuman Defense Network"" (EDN),.<br/></p>
<p>The EDN is a ""supposedly"" top secret ancient society which is responsible for defending mankind against an unknown 
enemy.</p>
<p>The only way to find solve the mystery is to carry out the training and missions 
assigned to you by the EDN as they ""intercept"" your fitness app while 
you are ACTUALLY and PHYSICALLY working out.<br/></p>
<p>While you become a secret member of the EDN,
you will need to generate Enduras. <br/></p>
<p>Enduras are an ancient energy source produced by our neuron and physical activity!</p>
<p>These Enduras give power to a ""top-secret"" artificial intelligence trapped in a 100 year old computer 
which you will communicate with as ""she"" guides you through your quests!</p>
<p> But beware! You need to keep on generating those enduras through your exercise otherwise ""she"" will die...<br/></p>
<p>Online quests are solved after you work out, at your own leisure through the use 
of the internet and your wits and you will be guided on an online treasure hunt to unlock the greatest secret of all time which spans far deeper than you can imagine!  </p>
<p></p>

<p><b>INTERFACE</b></p>
<p>The app will offer the normal fitness tracking features like distance, calories burned, GPS and pedometer tracking, importing data from third party apps and fitness bands as well as social sharing and music playback. You can view all these statistics just like any other app.<br/></p>
<p>However, at the same time it will also convert your workouts to enduras for the purposes of the game and your online quests.</p>
<p>You can also import workouts from third party apps and fitness bands and these again can be transformed into enduras!</p>
<p>Here is a summarised illustration of the interface:<br/></p>

<p>Exciting right? You betcha!!!</p>
<b><br/>HOW WE WILL USE THE RAISED FUNDS</b><br/><br/>The idea and storyline is
all set out, and our start-up has already raised enough funds to start developing the first version of
 the app (Chapter I - Earth &amp; Water). <br/>We expect to distribute the prototype to our iphone beta testers  in the next two months (<i>note: you could be one of them!</i>). <br/><br/>We will use any additional funding from this campaign to upgrade 
the necessary IT
infrastructure (website, servers, backend communication etc) while if we exceed our $5.000 target we will invest in enhancing the existing 
features and including professional video interludes/animation and 
hiring professional voice actors!


<br/><br/><b>* Campaign Update*<br/><br/></b>Based on current funding and the amazing 
response by our supporters, the Endohumans iphone app ""Chapter I - Earth
 and Water"" is already under development. Let's see if we can hit those 
further goals!<b><br/><br/></b>$500 -$2.000  Start development of iphone app ""Chapter I""             <b> FUNDED!</b><br/>$2.000 - $3.000  +Web Development services                                          Pending<br/>$3.000 - $4.000  +Develop Android version ""Chapter I""                         Pending<br/>$4.000 - $5.000  +Update server app/communication                          Pending<br/>$5.000 - $6.000  +Use of professional voice actors                                 Pending<br/>$6.000 - $8.000  +Updated graphics and animation interludes          Pending<br/>$8.000 - $15.000  +Possible use of video interludes/actors                 Pending<br/>$15.000-$30.000 Development of ""Chapter II - Fire"" as above            Pending<br/><br/><p><b>WHY IS FUNDING SO IMPORTANT TO US</b><br/></p>
<p>Endohumans will not be just any game...<br/></p>
<p>Its development will be a small spark
that will ignite an extraordinary concept that  will just take a life
of its own and grow to unimaginable size and potential. Our passion and purpose
is very strong and we are focused and eager to get straight to work.</p>
<p>We
have an amazing plot and mock-up of the entire project which just needs to come alive (kind of like Gepetto's
Pinocchio)! When it does, Endohumans will not only satisfy our business
goals and aspirations but also the kid in every one of us that finds out that magic
really does exist and dreams can come true!</p>
<p>Your investment will count and will help shape and excite the fitness gaming world for sure!The team will of course keep you briefed on the status of the project with regular updates every few days. <br/><br/><b><b>WHAT YOU'LL GET IF YOU CONTRIBUTE TO ENDOHUMANS</b></b></p>

and gaming app unlike no other! We think our idea is really cool and we want to
share it with you and make you a part of it! Endohumans will be the first mobile App in the world to combine fitness/running tracking with an epic online game! So users will get a captivating adventurous storyline which, 
in order to proceed in, they 
will need to get on their feet and start exercising! 
So, imagine you've just downloaded a new 
seemingly common smartphone fitness application  which like many others 
tracks your steps/runs/cycle rides and other workout info with the 
normal maps and musical playback... however this time something 
extraordinary happens!
This is not like any normal application! Soon you discover that your 
application has been ""intercepted"" and you are being communicated by the
 ""Endohuman Defense Network"" (EDN),.
The EDN is a ""supposedly"" top secret ancient society which is responsible for defending mankind against an unknown 
enemy.
The only way to find solve the mystery is to carry out the training and missions 
assigned to you by the EDN as they ""intercept"" your fitness app while 
you are ACTUALLY and PHYSICALLY working out.
While you become a secret member of the EDN,
you will need to generate Enduras. 
Enduras are an ancient energy source produced by our neuron and physical activity!
These Enduras give power to a ""top-secret"" artificial intelligence trapped in a 100 year old computer 
which you will communicate with as ""she"" guides you through your quests!
 But beware! You need to keep on generating those enduras through your exercise otherwise ""she"" will die...
Online quests are solved after you work out, at your own leisure through the use 
of the internet and your wits and you will be guided on an online treasure hunt to unlock the greatest secret of all time which spans far deeper than you can imagine!  



TRAILER TEASER VIDEO:

INTERFACE
The app will offer the normal fitness tracking features like distance, calories burned, GPS and pedometer tracking, importing data from third party apps and fitness bands as well as social sharing and music playback. You can view all these statistics just like any other app.
However, at the same time it will also convert your workouts to enduras for the purposes of the game and your online quests.
You can also import workouts from third party apps and fitness bands and these again can be transformed into enduras!
Here is a summarised illustration of the interface:



Exciting right? You betcha!!!
HOW WE WILL USE THE RAISED FUNDSThe idea and storyline is
all set out, and our start-up has already raised enough funds to start developing the first version of
 the app (Chapter I - Earth & Water). We expect to distribute the prototype to our iphone beta testers  in the next two months (note: you could be one of them!). We will use any additional funding from this campaign to upgrade 
the necessary IT
infrastructure (website, servers, backend communication etc) while if we exceed our $5.000 target we will invest in enhancing the existing 
features and including professional video interludes/animation and 
hiring professional voice actors!


* Campaign Update*Based on current funding and the amazing 
response by our supporters, the Endohumans iphone app ""Chapter I - Earth
 and Water"" is already under development. Let's see if we can hit those 
further goals!$500 -$2.000  Start development of iphone app ""Chapter I""              FUNDED!$2.000 - $3.000  +Web Development services                                          Pending$3.000 - $4.000  +Develop Android version ""Chapter I""                         Pending$4.000 - $5.000  +Update server app/communication                          Pending$5.000 - $6.000  +Use of professional voice actors                                 Pending$6.000 - $8.000  +Updated graphics and animation interludes          Pending$8.000 - $15.000  +Possible use of video interludes/actors                 Pending$15.000-$30.000 Development of ""Chapter II - Fire"" as above            PendingWHY IS FUNDING SO IMPORTANT TO US
Endohumans will not be just any game...
Its development will be a small spark
that will ignite an extraordinary concept that  will just take a life
of its own and grow to unimaginable size and potential. Our passion and purpose
is very strong and we are focused and eager to get straight to work.
We
have an amazing plot and mock-up of the entire project which just needs to come alive (kind of like Gepetto's
Pinocchio)! When it does, Endohumans will not only satisfy our business
goals and aspirations but also the kid in every one of us that finds out that magic
really does exist and dreams can come true!

The event brought 74 game makers to the Mercer Warehouse, making this Global Game Jam the largest in Edmonton's history. Together, the MADJAM participants made fifteen spectacular games which are <a href=""http://madjam.ca/games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">available online for free</a>. The speaker list included Andrew-David Jahchan of MADSOFT Games, Mark Barazzuol of EDAC, Trent Oster of Beamdog, and Erik Johnson of Infinite Monkeys. This event also played host to two representatives from Edmonton's City Council and a Microsoft swag booth. Throughout the weekend, over 200 people dropped in to watch the event livestream on Saturday and we had CityTV drop by to cover the event as well. We managed to give away over $6000 worth of prizes and goodies courtesy of our sponsors.

With the University of Alberta, Grant MacEwan, NAIT, and Edmonton Digital Arts College each launching their own game industry programs, we've seen an enormous surge of students looking for work in the industry. As it stands, Edmonton is ill-equipped to deal with the amount of graduates with only one AAA studio headquartered in the region (Bioware). While there are many indie studios cropping up, expanding a team is costly and often not at the top of an indie studio's priorities. Many game industry graduates have no choice but to leave Edmonton for greener gaming pastures or be forced to follow a different tech career path. This brain-drain inevitably results in a stagnant, closed-off game development community. We want to change this.</p><p>While there are a few initiatives in the region that are working to bring developers together (such as GameCamp Edmonton and a few student organizations), we firmly believe that there is a demand for a better, more permanent support structure for Edmonton'sup-and-coming game developers. MADJAM provides people with a place to experiment with game creation. MADJAM events will help give rise to new game studios, allow new game makers a chance to expand their portfolios and meet industry experts, and hopefully attract national and international attention to Edmonton as a game development hot spot.</p><p><br/></p><h1></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1299345/files/20150316110037-who.png?1426528837"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The primary organizers of MADJAM 2015 are members of <a href=""http://madsoftgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MADSOFT Games</a>, a small independent game development studio and publisher.

<p>One of the the biggest challenges MADJAM faces is one of time management. With full-time game development jobs, we as MADJAM organizers have a lot on our plates. In order to ensure we meet our deadlines, we have established a ""best completed before"" checklist of dates. Using this schedule and our experience with the first MADJAM event as a guideline, we feel confident in our ability to organize all the required venues, speakers, goodie bags, and prizes before each event.</p>
<p>A secondary challenge we face is bringing attention to MADJAM and its participants. We will continue to reach out to gaming blogs, podcasts, youtubers, and news groups to highlight the wonderful work being done in Edmonton.</p>

Any points earned by a team are also earned at the individual level. The points accumulate until the last event, at which point the three top ranking individuals will receive some amazing prizes. By incorporating this individual competition, we hope to encourage participants to work with different teammates and to push the boundaries when creating their games.In between events, the MADJAM games are posted online on the MADJAM site and subjected to a public vote. Teams with the most votes at the end of the voting period will earn more points to their individual tallies.There are four MADJAM events occurring throughout 2015, one of which has already come and gone with great success.Global Game Jam Event Date: January 23 - 25, 2015Location: Startup EdmontonThe first MADJAM event was a 48 hour game jam held in conjunction with Global Game Jam. The event brought 74 game makers to the Mercer Warehouse, making this Global Game Jam the largest in Edmonton's history. Together, the MADJAM participants made fifteen spectacular games which are available online for free. The speaker list included Andrew-David Jahchan of MADSOFT Games, Mark Barazzuol of EDAC, Trent Oster of Beamdog, and Erik Johnson of Infinite Monkeys. This event also played host to two representatives from Edmonton's City Council and a Microsoft swag booth. Throughout the weekend, over 200 people dropped in to watch the event livestream on Saturday and we had CityTV drop by to cover the event as well. We managed to give away over $6000 worth of prizes and goodies courtesy of our sponsors. You can read more about the event and the MADJAM organizers' thoughts here.Game Discovery Exhibition Event Date: April 25 - May 2, 2015Location: The Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science (CCIS), University of Alberta & other Edmonton locationsThe second MADJAM event will be a week-long celebration of game development in Edmonton, kickstarted with the brand-new Game Discovery Exhibition on Saturday night. Teams will be formed at the event and the theme announced. During the week, spaces around Edmonton and St. Albert will be made available for teams to meet and work, and we will be hosting a series of talks on development and design. Judging and a MADJAM after-party will take place the following Saturday, May 2nd.Click here for details!Unity Jam Event Date: July 17 - July 24, 2015Location: Northlands & other Edmonton locationsThe third MADJAM event is focused on development using the Unity engine. Held during the final week of K-Days, Northlands will be hosting a MADJAM booth in their Tech Life exhibit. Much like the GDX game jam, the Unity event will also feature a series of talks spread out across the week to discuss game development and design.Extra Life Edmonton Event Date: November 7, 2015Location: NorthlandsThe fourth and final MADJAM event will be held at alongside the Extra Life Edmonton 24 hour gaming marathon. The event will be streamed live and participants are encouraged to raise funds for Extra Life Edmonton before attending the event. This event will not have event-specific prizes in order to help raise money for the Stollery Children's Hospital.Edmonton is a city on the cusp of a video game explosion. With the University of Alberta, Grant MacEwan, NAIT, and Edmonton Digital Arts College each launching their own game industry programs, we've seen an enormous surge of students looking for work in the industry. As it stands, Edmonton is ill-equipped to deal with the amount of graduates with only one AAA studio headquartered in the region (Bioware). While there are many indie studios cropping up, expanding a team is costly and often not at the top of an indie studio's priorities. Many game industry graduates have no choice but to leave Edmonton for greener gaming pastures or be forced to follow a different tech career path. This brain-drain inevitably results in a stagnant, closed-off game development community. We want to change this.While there are a few initiatives in the region that are working to bring developers together (such as GameCamp Edmonton and a few student organizations), we firmly believe that there is a demand for a better, more permanent support structure for Edmonton'sup-and-coming game developers. MADJAM provides people with a place to experiment with game creation. MADJAM events will help give rise to new game studios, allow new game makers a chance to expand their portfolios and meet industry experts, and hopefully attract national and international attention to Edmonton as a game development hot spot.The primary organizers of MADJAM 2015 are members of MADSOFT Games, a small independent game development studio and publisher. We moved the company across Canada from Montreal in 2013 and we haven't looked back since. Current projects for the company include Project: Velyria, Avillum 2.0, Aikonia, and Me and My Dinosaur 2.Lead OrganizerAndrew-David Jahchan is a game developer and designer from Montreal, Quebec. He has been working in the game industry for over six years and is a co-founder of MADSOFT Games alongside Jose Jimenez III.Running large game jams like MADJAM does not come cheaply. We will be using monetary contributions to fund prizes and goodie bags for participants, renting and outfitting venues for talks and meetups, and advertising on the web. Given the chance, we will also use the money to rent booths at local conventions to advertise the event and display MADJAM games, with the goal of gaining more exposure for MADJAM and its participants. Additional funds not spent on MADJAM events or advertising will go to Extra Life Edmonton in support of the Stollery Children's Hospital.

One of the the biggest challenges MADJAM faces is one of time management. With full-time game development jobs, we as MADJAM organizers have a lot on our plates. In order to ensure we meet our deadlines, we have established a ""best completed before"" checklist of dates. Using this schedule and our experience with the first MADJAM event as a guideline, we feel confident in our ability to organize all the required venues, speakers, goodie bags, and prizes before each event.
A secondary challenge we face is bringing attention to MADJAM and its participants. We will continue to reach out to gaming blogs, podcasts, youtubers, and news groups to highlight the wonderful work being done in Edmonton.",22.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>Once upon a time; we saw a picture on the internet entitled ""<b>A Game of Life and Death;</b>"" where the God of Life played a game of cards with the God of Death.  They played to decide whether the deceased would be going to Heaven or to Hell. They played with a deck of Death Playing Cards; of course! Now you can possess a deck of playing cards inspired by those used only in the afterlife. If they really exist; this is what they would look like. </p>

<p>You play

that you deserve. More than a grenade, your personal assault

We are aware of the fact that all the features that we wanted for you will rise up the final bill but we wanted a grenade with a premium quality in order not to have the general dysfunctions of the other grenades on the market. Moreover, the Avatar Grenade won't need much maintenance for multiple use.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461770746/WHERE_ARE_WE_nxuanx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After
more than a year working our butts off, we now have fully functional

What
is Avatar Grenade?
Avatar Grenade
is a high-quality customizable grenade which shape, color and type can
be changed on your own will. From the base you can adapt your playing
way with a Core coupled to several Skinz (Patent pending) availables and more in the
future.
Isn’t
that awesome?

As an airsoft wholesaler company, we saw a
decade of minor noticeable innovations in the airsoft industry. We would like to
re-imagine the grenade to solve all the problems of the modern
fighter. No more nightmare grenades to spoil your raids.
With Avatar,
you will attack smarter and be the coolest of your team!









The
Avatar grenade is a rotative switch device that will make
your game easier. It is composed of a Core which contain the mecanism and a Skinz which contain the BB pellets.The
first Avatar Grenade Pack comes with an Impact Core which you can change the Skinz, enabling features that
will forever change the way you make an assault.



The Core integrate an innovative Auto Reset System which means after each time you use the grenade you just have to refill with gas and bbs. No more loose parts to handle and no more time wasted!










Put your
mind at ease as the Avatar grenade has Skinz in the
number of 3 (for the moment) :


- The
Standard Skinz :
This Skinz is the standard one as it will make your Avatar grenade a 
classical (with a little futuristic) but efficient shape and bbs 
dispersion device for fast and nearby assaults.





- The
Orb Skinz :
This Skinz is a more special one as it will make your Avatar grenade a 
globe shape. Bbs dispersion will be more anarchic due to the special 
shape and you could roll it and reach farther targets.





- The
Tacphoon Skinz :
This Skinz is the powerful one (by now) as it will make your Avatar 
grenade a dreadful nightmare of bbs blasting at a nearly 5 meters radius
 efficiently.
- And
many MANY other Skinz will be developped and available in a near
future...






You play
in the 21st century. It is about time for someone to make the grenade
that you deserve. More than a grenade, your personal assault
companion.
-
Durable
and well-constructed Skinz made of dense polycarbonate
-
Highly resistant and lightweight
-
Well-finished Aluminium CNC
-
Steel CNC internal parts for durability
We are aware of the fact that all the features that we wanted for you will rise up the final bill but we wanted a grenade with a premium quality in order not to have the general dysfunctions of the other grenades on the market. Moreover, the Avatar Grenade won't need much maintenance for multiple use.
After
more than a year working our butts off, we now have fully functional
Avatar grenade prototypes. We’ve harnessed the best of mecanics
and design to provide amazing features to solve all the problems of
the modern fighter.



Where we
are
We
now have a new generation of fully functional Avatar grenade
prototypes and - unlike previous iterations made in-house - they have
been built by our manufacturing partners. This gives us great
certainty about the manufacturing process to come.





Why we need you




We’ve
turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you and the awesome community
of players around the world. We want to learn from you, and with your
support, we will get this product to market that much faster. Our
product components are almost ready for tooling and then mass
production, but only your help will get us there. We have expertise
in manufacturing products, and we have partnered with manufacturers
that are experienced in the thermoforming and machining industries.
All together, we can make this happen.





*Note that shipping fees are added depending on the destination.



We
are a group of persons that share a passion for Outdoor and Extreme
sports, technology and design. After playing Airsoft games for
several years, we looked at our equipment and realized that they
haven’t evolved much in decades. So we set out to re-imagine how a
grenade should be in this day and age.Our
team has big brains including industrial designers and entrepreneurs
who have built businesses in the outdoor sports industry, computer
solutions and real estate financial optimization... A great business
melting pot for making this project come true!

President and CEORemy is a seasoned entrepreneur with extensive
experience in building companies and managering. He co-founded LW
Distribution, where he worked for worldwide airsoft brands,
fulfilling orders in Europe. He is involved in the current
strategic innovations and design thinking processes.

Helene Tran - Co-founder,
Head of Import and ExportHelene has an extensive experience in
Import and Export. She worked for more than 4 years in the Top 10 of
the home products importers in France. She co-founded LW Distribution
and she's been actively involved in improving the logistic process.Daoud
Iraten - Co-founder,
Head of OperationsDaoud is a seasoned entrepreneur in
Import/Export, in real estate and computer solutions. He is a former
business man helpful in strategy and marketing.
Extime Design - Design studio, In charge for designs and functionalitiesExtime refers to the French neologism created by Michel Tournier consisting in transforming an “intimate” thought into an “extimate” and making therefore a personal idea accessible for sharing it with the external world. Yannick Ays in charge of the project used to be a
particular experienced student in art and fulfill his road in design.
He worked for more than 3 years designing in France using CAO. He is
the main responsible of the multiple weird skinz of the grenade.

We are not only working on the Avatar Grenade and his numerous accessories to come.
As soon as you share this project with us, you will open a path to another greater era for Airsoft.We've mounted another team working on other big projects.We hope that you'll be part of it too.Many thanks for your supportAvatar Grenade Team


Qu'est-ce que la Grenade Avatar?
Avatar est une grenade personnalisable de qualité dont la forme, la 
couleur et le type peuvent changer selon vos désirs. De là vous pouvez 
adapter votre style de jeu avec les Cores couplés aux différents Skinz (Brevet déposé) 
disponibles et plus à l'avenir.N'est-ce pas formidable?
En tant que distributeur de produits airsoft, nous avons vu une 
décennie de petites innovations notables dans l'industrie de l'airsoft. 
Nous voulions recréer la grenade pour résoudre les problèmes liés au 
combattant moderne. Plus de grenades cauchemardesque pour gâcher vos 
raids.
Avec Avatar, vous attaquerez intelligemment et serez le meilleur de votre équipe!


La grenade Avatar est un accessoire de type bouton rotatif sans goupille qui facilitera votre jeu. Elle est composé d'un Core contenant le mécanisme et d'un Skinz contenant les billes.Le premier pack de Grenade Avatar est fourni avec un Impact Core qui peut changer de Skinz, permettant ainsi des fonctionnalités qui changeront définitivement votre manière d'attaquer.



Le Core intègre un innovant Système de Réinitialisation Automatique, ce qui signifie qu'après chaque utilisation de la grenade vous n'aurez plus qu'à la remplir de nouveau en gaz et en billes. Plus de pièces en vrac à manipuler et plus de temps perdu!




Soyez rassuré car la grenade Avatar dénombre 3 Skinz (pour le moment) :
- Le Skinz
Standard :
Ce Skinz est de type standard et fera de votre 
Avatar une grenade classique (un peu futuriste) mais de forme et de 
dispersion de billes efficace pour des assauts rapides de proximité.







- Le Skinz Orb :
Ce Skinz est un peu spécial car il donnera à votre grenade Avatar 
une forme ronde. La dispersion des billes n’en sera que plus anarchique 
en raison de sa forme spéciale et vous pourrez également la faire rouler
 pour atteindre des cibles plus éloignées.







- Le Skinz Tacphoon :
Ce Skinz est le plus puissant (pour le moment) et transformera votre
 grenade Avatar en un horrible cauchemar de billes explosant à presque 5 mètres
 de manière efficace.

- Et beaucoup BEAUCOUP d'autres Skinz seront développés et disponibles dans un futur proche...


Vous jouez au 21ème siècle. Il est temps que quelqu'un crée la 
grenade que vous méritez. Plus qu'une grenade, votre compagnon d'arme 
personnel.- Fabrication précise et durable des Skinz en polycarbonate dense

-
Très résistante et légère

-
Aluminium usiné de manière précise

-
Pièces internes en acier usiné pour la durabilité

Nous savons pertinemment que toutes les caractéristiques que nous 
voulions ferons monter le prix final mais nous souhaitions une grenade 
de qualité afin de ne pas avoir les dysfonctionnements constaté sur les 
autres grenades du marché. De plus, la grenade Avatar ne nécessitera que
 peu de maintenance pour de multiples usages.
Après plus d'un an à travailler d'arrache-pieds, nous 
avons un prototype fonctionnel de grenade Avatar. Nous y avons introduit
 le meilleur mécanisme et du design afin de fournir tous les éléments
 qui permettent de résoudre les problèmes du combattant moderne.



Où en sommes-nous
Nous avons maintenant une nouvelle génération de prototypes de 
grenades Avatar fonctionnels et - à l'instar des précédentes versions 
""maison"" - elles ont été fabriquées par notre partenaire fabricant. Cela
 nous rassure dans le futur process de production.





Pourquoi nous avons besoin de vous
Nous nous sommes tournés vers Indiegogo afin de vous faire 
partager notre idée et aussi à toute la grande communauté de joueurs 
dans le monde. Nous voulons vous connaître, et avec vos encouragements 
nous mettrons ce produit sur le marché beaucoup plus vite. Toutes les 
pièces sont d'ores et déjà prêtes pour l'usinage et la production de 
masse, mais votre aide sera nécessaire pour nous mener là. Nous avons 
déjà de l'expérience dans la production et avons passé des contrats avec
 plusieurs fabricants spécialisés dans le thermoformage et l'usinage. 
Tous ensemble, nous pouvons réussir.

ce dernier n'avait pas vraiment évolué ces 10 dernières années. Nous 
nous sommes donc attelés à ré-imaginer ce que devrait être une grenade à 
notre époque.Notre équipe possède des pointures dans le design 
industriel et des entrepreneurs ayant monté des entreprises dans 
l'industrie du sport, dans l'informatique et dans l'immobilier... Un 
grand ""melting pot"" pour faire de ce projet une réalité!

Extime design - Bureau de Design, en charge des designs et fonctionnalitésExtime se réfère au néologisme Français créé par Michel Tournier qui consiste en la transformation d'une “intime” pensée en une “extime” pensée et donc de transformer une idée personnelle en une idée accessible afin de la partager avec le monde extérieur. Yannick Ays en charge du projet était un étudiant 
particulièrement doué en art et a ainsi continué sa route dans le 
design. Il a travaillé pendant plus de 3 ans en France sur les logiciels
 de Conception Assistée par Ordinateur. Il est le principal responsable 
des multiples formes bizarres de la grenade.

Nous ne travaillons pas seulement sur la grenade Avatar et ses nombreux accessoires à venir.

このプロジェクトでは翻訳の面でairsoft-gameplay.comのオーナーに大変お世話になりました。感謝いたします。

アバターグレネードとは？
アバターグレネードとは、高品質でカスタマイズ可能なエアソフト向けのハンドグレネードです。Skinz(特許出願中)と呼ばれるグレネードの外装を交換することにより、グレネードの形状、色、そしてBB弾の飛び散り方のタイプを自由にカスタマイズすることができます。プレイスタイルに応じていくつかのSkinzを選択できる他、今後新しいSkinzも提供する予定です。これってすごいと思いませんか？エアソフト商品の卸売企業として、私たちは10年間にわたって数少ない革新的な製品を目にしてきました。私たちは、現代のエアソフターが抱える問題を解消するために、ハンドグレネードを再発明したいのです。味方の隊列を台無しにしてしまうようなグレネードの暴発はもう起こりません。アバターグレネードを使うことでよりスマートに攻撃できるようになります。チームで一番活躍できるのはあなたなのです！


アバターグレネードはによる安全装置のON/OFF機能をもつため、ゲームでの使用がより簡単になっています。回転式スイッチのメカニズムをもつと、BB弾を装填するから構成されています。
最初のアバターグレネードの製品版には、が付属します。インパクトコアはSkinzを交換できるため、突入の方法を根本的に変える各の特長を生かすことができます。
コア部分にはオートリセットシステムが搭載されており、グレネードを起爆させた後はガスとBB弾を再装填するだけで再使用可能な状態になります。ピンやスプーン、裏蓋といった脱着式の部品はもう存在しないのです。分解や組み立てのために時間を無駄にすることもありません！



安心してください！アバターグレネードには既に3種類のSkinzがあります。（今後さらに増える予定です。）
- スタンダードSkinz: このSkinzは標準的なものです。少し未来感がありつつも旧来の形をしたグレネードですが、至近距離の速攻に効果的な形とBB弾の飛び散り方をしています。


- オーブ型Skinz: このSkinzはより特殊な形状で、アバターグレネードを球形にすることができます。BB弾の拡散性はその特殊な形状によってさらに無秩序となり、転がして投げることでより遠くのターゲットに到達させることができます。


- Tacphoon型Skinz : このSkinzは威力が強いタイプで、有効半径約5メートルの範囲で恐ろしい悪夢のようなBB弾の爆風を発生させることができます。
- そして、近い将来にはさらに多くのSkinzが開発され、利用できるようになります。

私たちは21世紀の戦場にいます。そろそろ時代に見合った価値のあるグレネードを作り出すべきときです。グレネードを超えて、あなたの突入を支える相棒とでもいうべきものをです。
- 高密度のポリカーボネート素材で作られた、頑丈かつ工作精度の高いSkinz
- 高い耐久性をもち、軽量であること
- 仕上げ精度の良い、CNC加工されたアルミ素材
- 耐久性の高めるために、内部にはCNC加工されたスチールパーツを採用私たちが要求するこれらすべての特長により、最終的なコストが高くなってしまうことについては認識しています。しかし、市場に出回っている他のエアソフト向けハンドグレネードのような故障や動作不全を起こさないためにも、グレネードには特別に高い品質を求めているのです。さらに付け加えるなら、アバターグレネードは複数回利用してもそれほどメンテナンスを必要としません。お尻が取れてしまうんじゃないかと思うような一年以上に及ぶ懸命な開発の後、私たちはついに完全に動作するアバターグレネードの試作品を完成させることができました。私たちは、現代のエアソフターの問題を解消する驚くべき特長を提供するために、最良の機構とデザインを結びつけたのです。

私たちが今どこにいるか私たちは現時点で、次世代の完全に動作するアバターグレネードの試作品を完成させている一方で、形状の異なる他の試作品も製造パートナーとともに過去に繰り返し作成してきました。この経験は、製品版の製造プロセスについて素晴らしい確信を与えてくれました。
ユーザーの皆さまの協力が必要な理由私たちのアイディアを皆さま、そして世界中の素晴らしいエアソフターのコミュニティに公開するために、私たちはIndiegogoでのキックスタートに取り掛かりました。私たちは皆さまから学びたいと考えています。また、ユーザーの皆さまのサポートにより、この製品をより早く市場に送り出すことができると考えています。製品を構成する部品はほとんど加工の準備ができており、順次量産を開始することができます。しかし、皆さまの協力をもってしかそこにたどり着くことができないのです。私たちは製品製造の専門知識を有しており、加熱成型とマシニング加工の経験がある製造メーカーとも協業しています。これらすべてを合わせることで、この製品を実現することができるのです。

入力項目もあまりないので簡単だと思います！私たちは、アウトドアとエクストリームスポーツ、テクノロジー、そしてデザインについての情熱を共有するメンバーで構成されたグループです。数年間にわたってエアソフトを楽しみ、私たちが使っている装備は何年にもわたって十分には進化していないことに気づきました。そのため、現代におけるハンドグレネードとはどのようなものであるべきか、改めて考えてみることにしたのです。私たちのチームには、工業デザイナー、アウトドアスポーツ製品事業の経験がある事業家、システム開発、不動産資産最適化といったさまざまなスキルをもつメンバーがいます。さまざまなジャンルのスキルをもつメンバーが集まることで、このプロジェクトを実現することができたのです！

Extime design - デザインと機能性を担当するデザインスタジオです。Extimeという言葉は、Michel Tournier氏によって造られたフランスの造語で、""intimate(内面的なもの)”を”extimate(それを表出させたもの)”に変換するということで、言い換えると、一個人のアイディアを世界に共有できるような形で公開するという意味があります。アートとデザインを専門領域にもつYannick Ays氏がこのプロジェクトの責任者であり、彼はフランスにおいてCADを使用したデザインの仕事に3年以上携わった経験があります。 彼がこのグレネードのSkinzの奇抜なデザインを担当しています。私たちは、アバターグレネード以外の製品にも取り組んでおります。
このプロジェクトの公表は、より素晴らしいエアソフトの時代の幕開けになるでしょう。このプロジェクトには、他の数々の大きなプロジェクトに携わっているもう一つのチームが携わっています。ユーザーの皆もまた、このプロジェクトに参加していただけることを願っております。

<h2>Thank you for voting for us, we got a resounding YES! on Steam Greenlight!</h2>
<p><a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768775480"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetai...</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is Breaking Wheel?</h2>
<p>Breaking Wheel is a side scrolling 3D platformer set in various fantasy worlds, from fierce and fiery volcanoes to solemn and frosty snow deserts. Making your way past adversaries and deadly traps of all varieties - saws, axes, bombs, lava, boulders and more - you are steering the protagonist Wheel collecting coins and coffee. Breaking Wheel brings over 50 uniquely designed and diverse levels, a wide variety of customizable skins, and a number of bonus levels to the table. The game is accessible to newcomers to the genre, but also features a hardcore mode suited for the more veteran players among us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Gameplay</h2>
<p>The core mechanics seem simple at first: move left, move right, jump, and collect coins and coffee, but for every coffee you collect you move faster, jump higher and accelerate faster as well. Combine this with wall climbing, axis spinning, patrolling enemies, swords, guns, and deployable bombs, and you have an extremely versatile platforming game with a unique spin to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Different Level Types</h3>
<p>There are three different level types to choose from: </p>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>Normal levels</strong> you only 'die' if you take damage with 0 coins and 0 coffees. Normal mode can also be toggled to Kid Mode in the general settings. While Kid Mode is active, any Normal level will not reset upon taking damage ever.</li>
<li>In <strong>Hardcore levels </strong>any damage you take will lead to you having to start the level over. This mode is designed for the more seasoned players among us who want an extra challenge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bonus levels</strong> are anything that does not fit the formula of the core game and can be thought of as out of the ordinary. A few examples would be: A level where you control a pinball, drop bombs on waves of enemies to score points, or ""flappy wheels"" which is included in the demo. </li>
</ul>
<p>Coins you collect are cumulative and levels can be played again to collect more of them. Coins are used to unlock skins (cosmetic only) and further bonus levels to play.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Full Mod Support</h3>
<p>Breaking Wheel aims to have fully integrated mod support and every buyer receives access to the entire source code - no holds barred. This will allow every player to create their own levels, customize their gaming experience however they want, and share the fruits of their modding labor with other players around the world! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Compete against your Friends!</h3>
<p>Breaking Wheel is score based, meaning that every coffee, coin, and secret you collect in a given level will increase your score. Beating a level under the set par time will net you a bonus to the score as well.</p>
<p>At game launch, high scores will be saved on leader boards we are hosting on our website:Insanemindgames.com</p>
<p>If you have it in you, you can compete against your friends' scores, climb the ranks and become number 1 in Breaking Wheel.</p>
<p>The primary goal of creating this project was to learn, and the best way to learn is by doing, so we aimed to create a game. So far it has been amazing and anything anyone on the project wants to learn they have the freedom to, and we just tap it as 'Bonus' and let you enjoy our creativity, wherever it takes us. </p>

<h2>Check out our Demo</h2>
<p>Sign up on our <a href=""http://www.insanemindgames.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and download the demo today! Then drop in the forums and leave us some feedback and in the event we weren't thorough, a bug report or two. The Demo contains 5 levels, 5 skins, and 15+ audio tracks. it is available for Windows. </p>
<p>We are also in the process of <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768775480"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greenlighting </a>our game on Steam, drop by and give us a thumbs up!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Funding Goal</h2>
<p>As former modders turned indie developers, we started Breaking Wheel with a goal to stay within our means and complete a project in a reasonable amount of time without relying on exterior income. There are 11 people working on the project in varying degrees, and everyone is on a revenue share for when the project goes live. Many video game distribution platforms take 30% of the cost of the game, Indiegogo takes less than half of that, giving more money to the creators and allowing us to make more games for you in the future. We are using Indiegogo as a way to allow people who want to, to support us, while still receiving the game and additional benefits.</p>
<p>We plan to release the game in <i>Q4 2016 - Q1 2017</i> and will reinvest additional funds into Insane Mind Games to improve on our servers and future products.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Insane Mind Games is a group of various modding enthusiasts with a background of having made some of the most popular Fallout 4 and Skyrim mods available. </p>
<p>As like minded content creators we met each other via the amazing modding community that the Nexus had established over the last decade. We quickly recognized that we hold similar values and beliefs when it comes to what the essence of gaming should be. So, what started out as a group of seasoned modders of a variety of games, became much more.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A Word from our Lead Developer</h2>
<p>What started as a joke about a friend being crazy for coffee has transformed into dozens of levels, mind-boggling mechanics, and an entire bloody game! Working on the project to date has been amazing, from the people who jumped on board to just the sheer freedom to do whatever we want. The team is composed of prominent long term modders, programmers and friends. What we do to stand out is put honesty and integrity first, our profits second. We want to have a community, not a consumer base. </p>
<p>Breaking Wheel is all about that: a fun and enjoyable side scroller with imaginative mechanics derived from giving our level designers the creative freedom they enjoyed in their own modding projects in the past! </p>

</div></div>","Life With Giants - Adventure RPG Farming Life Sim
 

 

 
In Life With Giants you're the new leader of a tribe that was destroyed recently by a dreadful evil dinosaur. You'll take care of people and dinosaurs, manage your village, customizing and evolving it by planting food, upgrading houses in a system where each character is unique and charismatic with their own specific tastes and secrets and maybe you might find yourself a wife or a husband.

And that's not all, besides the neighborhood system already known in Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, you'll also have to face many challenges, like dungeons, bosses and puzzles.

 
To meet certain bosses, and to overcome certain challenges, you will need to tame the right creature for the task, such as flying or aquatic creatures. In Life With Giants the sky is not the limit.

 
The game will have a unique system for domestication, where you'll have to go after mighty dinosaurs, each one with its own domestication way. Imagine that, you need a fast mount to gather many items from the forest and still have time to bring a gift to your lover. You must gain a velociraptor's trust giving him meat and after that mounting it by surprise and taking its control.
    

 

Plant, reap, evolve.


Dating, wedding and family system.
 
Cute manga style portraits



 
Everything that you need in game can be dropped or crafted.
 

 
  
Dinosaurs can be captured and used both as a mount and helpers on daily chores, or as simply as your adventure partner if you prefer :)

You have a galaxy with more than 50,000 stars to discover, each star system is unique and completely different from the rest,  there is no planet exactly like another one.  It is not a conventional space game, because apart from piloting spaceships, you can also drive land vehicles, build and rule your space station, make your house and your vehicles.Fight, explore, mine, command your drones. And this is not all...   Simply get off your ship and explore the world on foot, collect and build with your own hands something that maybe one day you may call home.Imagine yourself building a base on one of those moons that you visited yesterday in order to wait for a solar flare to subside and collect the plasma so that the fission chamber of your ship has a special fuel that allows you to reach that faraway star?Or build it on that planet that was on the edge of a black hole full of exotic resources?Or maybe this time you want to build a wooden cabin next to a lake of that newly discovered planet that reminds you so much of the Norwegian fjords, why not stay a few days to fish and relax a little?When you have rested, get off your ship and go to the hangar where you will find your ground exploration vehicle ready to drive to that area which was impossible to land and collect as much titanium as you need in order to make a new ship. But do not forget the weapon in the glove compartment when you get out of the vehicle, because it is an area of ​​abominable monsters which would only bow to your powerful weapons.Once your new ship is built, you will be able to go to the system's Haz-234 asteroid belt. When you get there, the danger alarm is activated, the proximity radar detects artifacts in the area, which are impossible to identify yet. The extraction mining operation of Taaffeita to manufacture new crystals for your laser weapons will have to wait, as these artifacts are ancient surveillance drones of an unknown species that thousands of years ago became extinct, but for some reason their battle machines persevered over time and now they are approaching you in order to protect the old domain of their masters.The battle will be memorable if you manage to survive... Although OurSpaceRevolution is a space game, nevertheless, it makes everything possible.Only you and your imagination can put limits to this game.You can be an explorer, space engineer, hunter, farmer, architect, rewards hunter, pirate, hero, or combine all of these possible roles.This is a game that combines a spatial theme and OpenWorld.Depending on the funding raised, a story mode will be made and the multiplayer game mode will be prepared.Although the Pre-Alpha version will not have a story mode, it is something we want to implement at some point in the Alpha phase. However, we do not only want to have a main story but also introduce other secondary stories and we even want to develop the ones proposed by the players. Even make certain points of the main story with the players.In other words, the dimension, a variety of games and hours of entertainment and the speed of development that we want to give to this project, will depend in large part on the success that we obtain with this campaign.  Basically, OurSpaceRevolution has 4 different points to the rest of the videogames, and two of them can be amazing.  The big difference from most other games is that it is a paid game but you can get it for free and also obtain the items on the game's market for free.How is that possible ?When the game is finally released or in alpha version, you will have two ways to get it.One would be buying it and the other pressing the magic button ""which is the free option"".This last option is possible because when you play a video game or use your computer, it does not take full advantage of all the resources, we will take advantage of some of these remaining or residual resources without affecting in any way your user experience.So if you want to get the game but do not want to spend even a single dollar with this system it is already possible.The intelligent functions of the system will detect when you do not use the computer, so that it will be used to perform mining operations to mine cryptocurrencies.In other words, the game is 100% free for you and we eventually get our money back, without affecting your budget at all.We have had a functional prototype of this remuneration system from January 1, 2018 and it generates benefits each time the demo is tested.The mining operations will always be carried out trying that these do not affect the quality of your gaming experience, in fact as far as CPU is concerned, we have already optimized it.But we still want to go further with this system.Depending on the level of success of the campaign, we will make a development kit so that others can integrate this moneymaking system in their games including other types of applications and programs.and when we launch the Alpha version of the game, we would like to donate to charities a part of the profits that are produced with our innovative remuneration system.So if all goes well, not only can you obtain the game for free or free items from the market, but in part you will also be helping people who are in need. ""video about this in some days"" or you can see it in some days at :​ http://www.ourspacerevolution.com/what-s-new  Your smartphone has the components that a high level joystick has.We have developed software so that you can pilot the ships and vehicles with your phone.It really improves the gaming experience. Taking it to another level and increasing realism when it comes to piloting.And to make things even better, we have included voice commands. You can activate the protection shields of your ship or launch a missile at the selected target with your voice, as well as command the ship to jump to the nearest star, or tell your ship to turn off all the electronics so that those enemies that are swarming nearby do not detect you.You can also act as an assistant and voice computer of the ships and vehicles. And your ships will inform you by voice about some of the important events as well as the proximity of enemies, high radiation areas, low fuel, etc.""video about this in some days"" or you can see it in some days at :​ http://www.ourspacerevolution.com/what-s-new  Democracy, if the product comes out the users will have the right to propose new facets of the game, as well as: ideas, upgrades, improvements, new adventures to develop, a new spaceship class, etc.There will be a voting system to do this.If some idea is voted by the most and, therefore, considered as a good one, we would be happy to introduce in the roadmap of the game and at some point that idea will be integrated into the game.Example:It would be great if you could create a type of shield that would make the ships submerge in the stars, so that the ships could be camouflaged inside them or extract materials to build energy cells ""batteries"" such as Helium3 Etc.   Our own peripherals will be created for the game.Apart from transforming the smarthpone into a joystickwe are also developing our own peripherals for our game.Flight Stick and Throttle. MFD ""Cockpit Panels"" usb or wireless.VR gamepads, we will create software so that you can connect your smartphone and use it for VR. We will create VR gloves for more immersion.In other words, we are going to create a few devices to improve the realism and quality of our game.And these devices would be really cheap!How can these devices be cheap?Because if you want, you can make them yourself. We will publish a guide with very detailed instructions on how to make such devices on our website. You won’t need expensive components and they will be very easy to assemble. We will also provide you with constant support, answering your questions, solving your doubts and inquiries about this game.and the other option it's You will also be able to buy these devices directly from us.Note:   In order to do all of that we need to have certain success in our project.

As well as various hand tools to build, explore, repair etc.""video about this in some days"" or you can see it in some days at :​ http://www.ourspacerevolution.com/what-s-new 9- Use extraction tools !To get materials such as iron, copper, food, etc. 10- Create automated machinery !to extract even more resources than you do with hand tools. Start mining, hunting, fishing, cultivating, etc. Do all this with drones or build special machinery.""video about this in some time"" You can see it in: http://www.ourspacerevolution.com/what-s-new 11- Revolutionary Market inventing a new remuneration system that allows you to buy products or simply acquire them for free!Without advertising, without selling your information to third parties. If you do not want to gather the necessary resources to manufacture your ship and you want to have it straight away, use the Market!In the market you will find everything you need, your vehicles, weapons etc, and if you do not want to pay for them, simply acquire them for free with the ""magic"" button.Example: You want the MK2000X laser turret: You can gather the materials and make it yourself or you can buy it in the market, but you do not want to spend a single dollar, that’s when you can press the ""magic"" button and in a few minutes you’ll get the laser turret completely free. 12- few loading screens !There are no loading screens when you descend to the planets or moons.as you can see in the videos. 13- Intention to develop a multiplayer mode and also a story mode.These will be integrated if good financing of the project is acquired. We would also like to be able to develop a version for consoles. 14- You can own a planet or a moon or an entire star system !And have absolute control and sovereignty over it! Without anyone bothering you,  even free of NPC's or being able to control them.

 15 - Terraforming Some planets will be terraformed using terraforming tools to turn an inert world into an authentic paradise.""video about this in some time"" or you can see it in :​ http://www.ourspacerevolution.com/what-s-new 16 - It's not just a space game!If we achieve a good level of game financing, there will be special planets.For example, a planet where you can run ship or land vehicle races. Or a planet for hunters who want to live a survival experience with their separate story, where they can acquire special resources, etc. If all goes well you can propose more special planets.   Is there any difference between the paid version and the free version?If you choose the free version the frame rate per second is affected, not being able to upload more than 50 frames per second ""or less"". Nor will a resolution higher than 1080P or similar be allowed, since, depending on the monitor that you have this resolution may vary a bit, and graphics in Ultra mode ""which is the maximum limit allowed by the game"" will be disabled. The maximum option in the free version is “very high quality”. Which is the penultimate option in graphic quality in the paid version.The users of the free version won’t be able to vote or propose ideas for the game.Support team gives priority to the users who got the paid version of the game. Apart from this, everything is going to be the same in the free version.I bought the paid version, can the special compensation system ever work?Only if you choose it.  There will be 3 options of special remuneration in the paid version.1 - In the market.You decide to buy a laser cannon for your ship "" for example, because you do not have time to collect the materials to build it "".You can pay for it or press the magic button, the weapon will be yours and the system will be mining a few minutes (obviously depending on the object you buy it will take more or less time)2 - If you want to support us. So that we can dedicate more resources in the creation of this game, there will be an option for this. if you choose this option, even having an option just for that, below. We want to contribute a part of the benefits to charitable causes. 3 - and finally, as we said before we want to take this system much further,When the game is fully finished "" or at Some point of the Alpha version ""You will also have an option to allocate all the profits from the special remuneration system to a charitable cause, choosing one of the NGOs that decides to collaborate with us.""We will only admit NGOs that are for humanitarian causes.""   We are a small team that wants to grow.Most aspects of the game are already done, everything you see hereand much more (we will be updating to show more).Thanks to your support it will soon be possible and we will make a great game. current team: Marti Vidal:  The one who had the idea of this project.He is in charge of all the programming. He created the prototype device for the game, the mining system, a big part of the 3d designs, turned the mobile phone into a joystick, the person who developed the game´s structure and how the Galaxy is made, etc. In other words, everything concerning programming in the game is currently carried out by Martí.Irina Bespalova:  Translations and linguistic support.She is Russian, fluent in 3 languages. She lived and worked in the United States. She has been living in Spain for the past 5 years now. She will work on translations and give support as a helpdesk.Jose Mari Sales: Entrepreneur, with a wide experience in the computer world, he is a co-founder of an important entreprise in France that deals with databases.He is our first investor who was the first one to believe and support this project.In the future he will take care of the company's operations and management.Thanks for all, Partner.see more about us and other collaborators who help us at: http://​https://www.ourspacerevolution.com/about-us     Apart from what has been already mentioned.We could also say: This is intended to be a different game, where players can choose the creation of their content.Because we want to improve the remuneration system in the world of videogames, making it possible for a player to have more options to acquire a product and not just pay money all the time.So that once and for all everyone can understand that things can change for the better.Nobody will ever be able to say that playing a video game is a waste of time, because from now on you will also be able to help people in need.Today with your help we can take videogaming to the next level, thanks to you we will all be able to make a  difference in this world.  This is the reason why we are so specific about the amounts of money below.The first two minimum amounts will be to continue working alone on the project.We are a tiny team working on this project. The team consists of Martí  who iscreating all the game content, as well as doing all the programming, design, generating ideas.Another team member is Irina who is in charge of the linguistic support.If this is the case, everything will be slower, obviously under such circumstances we won’t be able to do a story mode, or even if we do it, it will eventually happen in a distant future if all goes. And obviously such time consuming details as multiplayer will have to wait. We can not guarantee what will be done and what won’t be done and when we finally finish the game. Anyway, we will work as much as we can, to make this project possible. Although, to be honest:At the moment we have a lot of work already done.Some spaceships, a mining sistem prototype, the general structure of the game are partially done.The galaxy, star systems, the structure of the planets, the way to generate thousands of planets semi procedurally is also ready. However, not all planets will be handmade, only the planets of property, that is the intention, we have already handmade some moons and planets and the result is very good. The program that transforms the smartphone into a joystick.It works perfectly, and improves a lot the inmersive feelings when you pilot spaceships, really, it's a glory to use it.Nevertheless, there is a huge chunk of work left to be done so far.   30.000 euros or less.-We will try to make a simpler version of the game, without multiplayer. -The pre-alpha will be launched and in each update we will be improving the project step by step.-At some point, an Alpha version will be launched. And we will keep improving until it becomes a finished game.-And trying to launch the full version of the game at some point.-We don't know which functions and game aspects mentioned above will be present with this level of funding.-Nevertheless, we will try to implement them in future updates .-The special remuneration system will be created. But maybe the market not. 60.000 euros.-We will expand the team by hiring some great freelancers to go faster with the development.-Mainly to amplify and give exclusivity to 3D and other designs.-We will make a simplified game version  without multiplayer.-The pre-alpha will be launched and will be updated progressively until reaching an Alpha version.-And trying to launch the full version of the game at some point.-A story mode will be possibly made.-The special remuneration system will be created. But maybe the market not. 150.000 euros.-A company will be created sometime near the end of the campaign.-We will be a bigger group than currently.-The star map will be more extensive we add some special stars.- One or two special plantes like race planet.- We  launch the full version of the game at some point.- Story mode will be made.-It will be updated in the future and enriched with some type of multiplayer mode.-The special remuneration system will be created. And probably the market at some point. 250.000 euros-A company will be created sometime near the end of the campaign or during the course of the campaign.-We will be a medium low team size working on this.-The star map can be increased we add a dwarf galaxy.- two or more special planets like the race planet and hunting planet.- Own planets will  works in multiplayer and in solo mode.- Story mode will be made and some expansions.-Own peripherals will be created for the game ""we currently have a prototype to show you about this"". And this ones be cheaper ! and really amazing !-You can choose to play solo or in multiplayer mode.-Capital ships will be created, which are like aircraft carriers or mobile space bases.some vessels size XL and one or two  XXL size.-Some planets can be terraformed.-The special remuneration system and market will be created. 500.000 euros.-A company will be created sometime near the end of the campaign or during the course of the campaign.-We will be a medium or medium low team size working on this.-The star map will be increased with other galaxy.-Several special planets will be created. Each of them with different stories.- own planets will  works in multiplayer and in solo mode.- Story mode will be made and some expansions.-Own peripherals will be created for the game ""we currently have a prototype of this"".And this ones be cheaper ! and really amazing !-You can choose to play alone or in multiplayer mode at  some point of alpha version.-Capital ships will be created, which are like aircraft carriers or mobile space bases. vessels size XL and  XXL size.-Compatibility with VR.-Some planets can be terraformed.-The voting system will be integrated at some point once the game is finished, players can propose new improvements or new content for the game.-The special remuneration system and market will be created. € 1.000.000 euros or more.-All of the above.-We will be a medium  or big team size working on this.-The game will be translated into Spanish, English, Russian, French, German, Chinese, etc.-we add customer service with this languages. to offer a high quality support.-New functions for ""gamepad"" flight control.-You can use your tablets as an extension controls. For shields, ship systems, sensors, access to the market, etc.-We will create 3 more galaxies apart from the current one.- more ships, more variety, more quality, etc.-The voting system will be integrated in the same Alpha version.-We will have more capacity to carry out more requests from users to improve the game.

<p>We are a gaming lounge in Casper, WY that strives to become haven for families and gamers to enjoy doing what they love, playing video games with friends. PowerUp Gaming Lounge was created from the ground up by two people with no help other than their passion for video games and bringing people together. We are currently doing pretty well for being open for a month and a half but have found ourselves playing a game of catch up due to bills instead of being able to make payments in advanced and become more financially comfortable. We hope that this campaign we will kick-start our business so that we will be able to flourish instead of drown. We have so many things that we would love to add in the future. A cafe, a VIP area, and also expand to the downstairs of our rented building. Currently we can only afford a few games on each PC and half of them are free to play games. We would love to have an amazing selection but currently everything we have made has gone to our bills. Also we lose customers because they are not that impressed with our selection. We would love to be able to really be on the forefront of gaming. </p>
<p>Our mission is to create a community for people who normally would not interact, and give the the opportunity and atmosphere to take a step out of their comfort bubble to make new friends and awesome memories. We have young customers who come in after school in order to wait for their parents to come home from work, a wonderful group of adults with disabilities that come in and have a great time, and families that come in and find that we have something for everyone to play.</p>
<p>We want to do so much more for the gaming community in Casper. We want to be a safe place for parents to allow their kids to come to and a place where people can play the latest games and see if they are something they would like to purchase. The hope is to be a place where the community can come together. A place where people can feel safe and have a lot of fun.

<h3>Where in the world did this idea come from???</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi! My name is Matt Hayashida.  I'm and InterVarsity Alum from Cal State University, Long Beach.  I spent two years interning with InterVarsity and love the ministry there.  My parents met in AACF (Asian American Christian Fellowship) in college.  And I have dozens of connection to people in Epic/Cru (some from Navs, too).  College ministry has always been very close to my heart.</span></p>
<p>The concept of CruVarsity Clicker started a few years back when a couple friends and I started a project called Youth Group Sim--a clicker game where you play as a youth pastor trying to grow the largest youth group possible.  We had a blast developing the concept together and scraping together our graphics and code.  CruVarsity Clicker is the spiritual successor to the unfinished game of my college days.</p>
<p>I've always loved games and recently decided to learn programming/Unity (thanks to Covid keeping me cooped up in my room all day).  This past year, a handful of my friends have entered the ministry world and have asked my for support.  Being the jobless boi that I am, I unfortunately had to ask them to wait.  My hope is to use a bit of my creative endeavors to support the friends of mine whose lives I am parodying.</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>CruVarsity Clicker is an incremental idle game, which means it's super simple, easy to pick up, and a casual play.  You play as a new Campus Minister who is sent to Idle University.  Your goal is to create a thriving fellowship of students.  You start of as any good Christian should, by praying (tapping the pray button).  Praying increases your faith which you can use to invite students to your fellowship.  Student will passively generate faith and can be upgraded with small groups.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605905770/bwmyys0kz60sawvqb1yv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You can host Large Groups to generate vision.  You can upgrade your students into Core Members, then into Leaders.  You can send your student to chapter camp.  And you can have your leaders disciple apprentices.</p>
<p>Eventually you can unlock the fellowship upgrade tree.  With it, you can get a keyboard for the worship team, play some icebreaker games, and become a social media influencer, all to show people the love of Jesus.  These upgrades all increase the effectiveness of your fellowship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After your fellowship is thriving like no other, you can plant a plant at a new campus (the prestige function).  Planting a new campus will give you mission which you can use to recruit interns.  Interns give all kinds of special bonuses and can heavily determine your playstyle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605906700/mdsyfoptauh4ytdaftmz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Additionally, throughout the game you can close your main tabs and look out onto Idle University's quad.  Here you can not only pray for campus, but also find student wandering around and reach out to them.  Tapping on them gives you bonus Faith, Vision, or Mission.</p>
<p>As you plant more and more campuses, your ministry team will grow.  See how many students you can possibly get in your fellowship!</p>

<h3>What you get if you support</h3>
<p>Although I plan to make the game free, if you contribute, you will get early access to the game as well as have you feedback considered in the final product.  Additionally, there are a few more sprites that I have left unfinished.  Supporters at higher levels will be able to put themselves (or someone they know) into the game.</p>
<p><strong>You can be an intern,</strong></p>
<p><strong>An animated student on the quad, </strong></p>
<p><strong>Or you can have your campus be a background for the game!</strong></p>
<p><strong>That's right!  I will put you into this game if you support it!</strong></p>
<p>(check out the perks! They are awesome!)</p>
<p>If CruVarsity Clicker raises enough support, have a couple stretch goals in mind.  If this campaign really hits it off, we could do all sorts of things.  I'm open to suggestions, haha</p>

<h3>Development Costs</h3>
<p>Because the game is 95% developed, there are basically no development costs left.  All visuals are custom made by me.  And all sound has generously been done by a couple of my friends.  The developer's fee for the app stores is the only cost that remains.  Aside from those, everything that this campaign makes will be donated to various friends of mine who are in different ministries (if you are curious about which ones, you can ask me directly).</p>
<p>I plan to make this game free to download on both the Google Play Store and the App Store.  The publisher fee for those are $25 and $99 respectively.  Everything beyond that will go to people in ministry</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>December, I will finish up the artwork based on people who support this Campaign.  Make sure you get those perks while they last, if you want to be in the game!</p>
<p>That means first week in January will release the closed beta.  Soon after that, I will apply for publishing on the various app stores.</p>
<p>By the end of January, The game will hopefully be approved and free to download for everyone.</p>
<p>Going forward: I loved the development process of this game.  Who knows, maybe I'll make another.  Let me know if you think I should :D</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Getting this game into the Apple App store might prove difficult.  Given that this is an indie game, we shall see how hard the approval process is.  Also, I don't have a Mac, so I'll need to outsource some of the development.  Other than that, the challenges are behind me.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What can you do?</h3>
<p>I'd love for you share this with your friends.  Share this with you college pastor.  Share this with your students.  Share this with your friends in ministry.  Share this to the Babylon Bee.  Anyone who appreciates a little ministry parody will be sure to get a kick out of this project.  </p>
<p>I'd also hope that seeing this campaign gives you a little prophetic tingle--that sense that something about how our culture does ministry is a little funny... not the good sort of funny.  I've been learning how important it is to step away from models of ministry that are all about numbers and growth and into ministry that builds deep relationships.  I hope that playing this game will make you just a little bit uncomfortable with the ways we are tempted into the American corporate schema of doing ministry—the one that tries to get as many numbers as possible, the one that treats Church as a business formula—and push you to take a stand against that.</p>

I'm Alicia: just your ordinary IT professional. Because of my passion for IT, I always ask, ""What IT solution I use that will improve the overall experience of my life, or the lives of the people I work with, the community I live in, and the world we share?""When we are financially blessed, it's OK to raise our standard of living; but we must also raise our standard of giving.Getting a little creative this time with my extra-curricular IT efforts, I developed a couple of environmental conservation themed games for the iOS platform. Love our Coral Triangle for the Coral Triangle Center who is helping to restore our Amazon of the Sea in Southeast Asia:· 76% of the world’s coral species are found here,· 6 out of 7 of the world’s sea turtle types call this area home as well,· 37% of all reef fish species in the world reside here:· 130 MILLION people also depend on these resources!Each game has a Know The Animal section educating us on why these animals are endangered, and how conservation helps.We have seen success with the iOS games, so it seems only fair to give the Android community access to these educational games and awareness of their causes.Development cost for the game is around USD $5,000Gaming for a better world is our slogan.When you back this project, I will personally send you a digital video made with my underwater camera!

<p>We have been working for over a year to create our new game; we
took all of our learning, mounds of your feedback and game improvement ideas,
and produced this completely new version of ""Blazing Silks” called “High
Stakes Racing”.  We are very proud of this new game and it has improved
game-play in the areas you have come to love as well as many exciting new
elements that have been encouraged by our fan-base. </p><p></p>

<p>The goal of this new game is to build the greatest horse racing
breeding and racing empire in our virtual world. It focuses on building a
bloodline over many generations to breed one or more ultimate Breeders’ Cup
Champions.</p>
<p></p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This game will have these key features, plus a whole lot more:</span><br/>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">New core game “cycle” that
includes crafting and resource management. 
You can care, feed, train, and equip your horses and jockeys.  You can staff and maintain your farm.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Expanded racing challenges – with
over twenty gorgeous tracks and hundreds and hundreds of racing challenges  - the single player campaign will take months
to finish. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Interactive Racing – we are going
to let you take the reins and see your favorite Breeders’ Cup tracks from the
best seat in the house.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Everything has been improved and made
more comprehensive: breeding, training, and preparing your horse and it’s race
strategy and tactics.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have created a fun and immersive comic book
story-line, fully illustrated by our artists.</span>
</li>
<li>There are literally hundreds of enhancements and new game play – you can

<p>Our goal is to bring our entire
horse racing world to mobile so you can sneak a quick game in anywhere whilst
you're pretending to pay attention to something else. In this day and age it’s
important to keep on top of the henchmen and keep those antagonists under
control. We felt that as a committed stable owner you would need access to your
empire at all times, even when you were on the go.</p>
<p>So, the mobile version of our
game is in the works.  You will be able to play it on your Android and
Apple devices and eventually your PC as well. 
We have decided to build this in “modules” and release components of the
game, as they are ready.  You will see below what our plan is and a little
preview of some of our prototypes.</p>

<p>We know that asking for money for
a Facebook and Mobile game is a big ""ask,"" so we are trying to give
you as much as we can back, by releasing our games for free and offering
lots of cool stuff.  This is kind of like you giving to us, and we give
back to you; or paying forward.  Another way to think of it is that you
are paying a discounted price for something you wanted anyway, and we're
throwing in some extra gifts to say thank you for your help.  Here is the
chart of perks you can get when you contribute:</p>
<p></p><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445369920/h9hjl4quflfavingmop8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>In any case, with your help we
can release games for free, and continue to produce world-class horse racing

<p>In addition to trying to raise
$150,000 to finish our game, we have established several stretch goals,that if
we by chance raise more money, we will achieve with additional funds.  They include things like our full interactive
racing, mobile games and a lot more.</p>

<p>The more awareness we create, the
more money we will be able to raise, and we will be able to keep creating great
racing games and keep our awesome community growing.</p>
<p>We really need for you to get all
of your friends, colleagues, and neighbors to join in on our fun; so we are
going to give away three awesome prizes to the top three supporters who bring
in the most contributions using Indiegogo's sharing tools.  Therefore even
if you can't afford to contribute a lot yourself, you can still win a great
prize by recruiting other people to donate money through your own connections
and fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly what the
prize will be, because we want it to be awesome and meaningful to our winner -
and we haven't figured out what the pinnacle of awesome is yet!  But we do
know one thing – the top prize will <u>include</u> tickets to next years
Breeders’ Cup weekend.  Second and third prizes will most certainly be something
like a super cool collectible or maybe a lead role in one of our future games,
or who knows...something even better we have not yet thought of.  In any
case it will be really cool and worth pursuing!</p>
<p>Please note - we cannot promise
that pair of roller skates you potentially wanted for your 5th birthday though.</p>
There will be a twenty-referral minimum for a prize and we will be
measuring both the number of referral’s and the total amount contributed by
your referrals when selecting our winner. Remember, if you can't contribute and
want to go for this special prize be sure to create and Indiegogo account and
use their tools!<div>

<p>At I-Race we are big fans of horse racing.  However, we are even bigger fans of racehorses and we are committed to increasing the awareness and love of our sport and most importantly the beautiful equine participants.  Additionally, we are committed to the humane and loving treatment of these equine athletes during their career and in their retirement.  As such we really admire the efforts of the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation (TRF) and their affiliated companies. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444849860/ux5oyzgw3nlj6yk9xim6.png"" src="""" style=""width: 622px; height: 311px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The TRF's mission is clear ""To save Thoroughbred horses no longer able to compete on the racetrack from possible neglect, abuse and slaughter.""  As explained on the TRF website, the sad truth is that a vast majority of the general public and even many racing fans are unaware of the sad fate that awaits thousands of Thoroughbreds each year. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The reality is the training and racing community is only equipped financially to care and breed a small number of the horses bred each year for racing. The further reality is that horse meat is in high demand in many foreign countries and there are several slaughterhouses in the U.S., Canada and Mexico happy to create a supply.  It is a reality the TRF is determined to change and one we are hopeful we can help change as well.  </span></p>
<p>So we have decided that a percentage of every dollar raised will go directly to the TRF or one of it's affiliated companies.  You can learn more about the TRF and its efforts <a href=""http://www.trfinc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since our first beta game released our entire team has been blown away by the passion, interest, and support that so many of our players have expressed and given. Most importantly we are truly appreciative of the patience displayed and the thoughtful feedback given, as we ""learned"" how to make a better racing game. </p>
<p>The journey to create our full Blazing Silks game began over a year ago with a customer survey that so many of you we're kind enough to provide your thorough, honest and provocative ideas. We have listened to your feedback and believe we are going to meet and exceed your expectations. We have stayed true to our cause, largely because we felt vested in you and our promise to make a better racing game than any that existed in the market.</p>Thanks for reading, and we hope you'll consider investing in the future of Blazing Silks and I-Race. With your help we can continue to deliver exciting and fun racing games for everyone.<br/>

<div></div>
<p>The goal of the new game is to
breed, race and train Breeders’ Cup Classic champion horses. This is
accomplished by developing a championship caliber bloodline by progressing
through the game, building a World class horse racing operation, training and
racing your horses to the top of the game’s leader-boards and continuing to
improve your horses generation after generation. </p>
<p>The game has grown substantially
in size, with over 20 beautiful and recognizable tracks from around the world,
plus a compelling and immersive story driven single-player-game that will take
months of regular game-play to complete. </p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the new
game-play elements are:</p>
<b>

Expanded Stable Management</b><div>We felt that our original stable was
inadequate compared to the ambitions of our racing players.  We have therefore overhauled the old stables,
mucked them out, hosed them down and constructed a brand new stable
pristine management system. </div>
<div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444849431/yx1csspcpqsy0hzwn5ox.png"" src="""" style=""width: 408.16px; height: 415px;""/></p>
<p><b>A New Mission System </b></p>
<p>
The new Blazing Silks mission
system gives our players a set of compact, direct, and increasingly challenging
goals to accomplish over the course of the game. They are purely
optional; and you can play the game any way you like, but
missions give rewards and should not overly tax your mouse finger.</p>

</div>
<div><b>Core Game Cycle</b></div>
<div>
<p>We have completely re-written our
core game-play and replaced our ""Challenges"" into two separate,
self-directed game-play elements: 1) a core management cycle of training,
caring, feed, managing, and equipping your horses and 2) global racing
challenges. </p>

<p><b>Training Your Horses</b></p>
<p></p>
</div>
Now you will have to build
your own “Training Centers” and improve them through crafting,
construction and sometimes invention. 
You will need to make constant choices how to actively train your
horse.  You must work harder for your
success; luckily we have made the work entertaining.</div>

(who really want to “control” the action), coming soon to this version of the
game will be the ability to race in single-player and some multi-player interactive
races.  These races will have interactive
elements - the ""Urge"" button, direction controls, and pacing your
horse - that will allow players compete not only on their ability to train and
prepare their horses, but also based on their own digital dexterity!</span></p>

<p>Before we launch our full game, we
plan to launch three unique mobile horse racing games, each one with its own
set of skills to master. Some of you players revel in the chance to be in the
saddle and steering your horse to victory, if so then Peer-to-Peer racing game
will be for you. It's kind of a ""Mario Cart"" but with horses and
other vital trademark infringement avoiding differences. Actually it’s more
serious and realistic than Mario Cart could ever be, (we have not yet seen a
plumber in a cart in red dungarees on the road, but then the world is a big place, so perhaps one day).</p>
<p>Perhaps you relish the owning and
training gameplay of our Facebook game and would like to try your hand at our “Owners
Club”.  Or perhaps you feel that your
skills lie in picking a winner, and the wagering of in-game gold coins is your
calling, in which case you will want to try our for-fun wagering game “ Blazing
Silks – Stake your Claim” (working title).</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Peer-to-Peer Racing</b><br/></p>

</span></p>
<p>Here is a short video of our P2P
racing prototype. Please do not ask why we have a race venue called hot
chocolate, these things happened during prototypes.. Our player jumps in and expertly weaves through the pack,
before using boost to get ahead and completely thrash our other players in
the match! What fun! </p>
<p>You'll be able to race at any of
our tracks, in your chosen racing silks and horse, and choose from a
variety of different camera perspectives - although we all like jockey cam the
best! With up to 10 players at once from around the world you could be
racing to win or at least disrupt your friend’s hehe... Steward!!</p>

</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Well if the life of a virtual
jockey isn't for you, maybe you'd be better at the helm of your own farm.
Owners club continues where Blazing Silks leaves off with you expertly managing
your way to further success and riches in a simplified mobile game environment.
You can still race at your favorite tracks and enjoy looking after your horses
to win game currency and rewards.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>And you can try your hand at
virtual wagering, use your skills to expertly handicap the race and try to win a
fortune in gold coins. Of course if you lose your virtual shirt you can always
go and do a bit of virtual jockey work on our P2P game or help out at the
Owners Club to earn some more coins.</p>

<p>We have some amazing artists on
our team and you are going to love the look, the characters and the music in
our game.  They have done a fantastic
job, and created a stunning and massive world for our. Our 3D horse racing
assets alone exceed 40Gb, and the massive amount of effort we spent creating
the new tracks is evident in every race you run. </p>

our engineers are seasoned
industry professionals, dedicated to creative coding. Code is written for the
servers that sit in the back doing the number crunching, the web clients that
you play on, and the 3D system that delivers you the racing.  In this massive game these guys have done a
great job bringing it all together.</span><br/>

No game leaves the stable

play the game from start to finish many, many times; covering the full breadth

the while collecting bugs to fix, and recommendations on balance. It is a huge
task with a game of this size.  </span><br/>

<p>Everyone wants one.  Until now – nobody could have one.  Get your very own white horse to race and breed with.  In fact create as many white horses as you want.  It will turn every head in the game and leave them wondering – how do I get one?  Well they can’t unless they buy the right tiers in our Indiegogo campaign!<br/></p>

Don’t assume because you start
our current game by breeding with a Breeders’ Cup Legend, that in our new game
you get to do the same.  In the new game, you will need to be well on your
way to greatness before you get even a glimpse of these horses and then you are
going to need a good portion of Fort Knox to cover the stud fees.  But if
you buy a tier with this perk included you will get a champion horse in your
stable from the start to breed with…. oh think of the possibilities!!<br/></p>

<p>Get yourself a one-of-a-kind
Blazing Silks bobble head horse for your vehicle or wobbly item to project your
interest in the noble sport of horse racing. Yes, it can be one of your horses
and will have your horses name inscribed on the base.  Please note however
your bobble head horse is a gelding so it is a waste of time to try to breed
them with other bobble headed horses to produce bobble head fillies and colts. (N.B.
Bobble head horse food must be purchased separately.)</p>

High Stakes Racing"" and to create related Blazing Silks mobile games.  Are you ready for the new Blazing
Silks game? I know we are!If this is your first time on Indiegogo, then let us explain that this is a ""crowdfunding"" campaign where a lot of people give a little bit of money and it adds up to a lot of money.  So we are just asking that people give a few dollars. So, for example, if all of our active customer's gave just  $5 we would have enough money to get this game done! And with the perks below you would get $20 of in-game currency $10 in this game and $10 in the next game...it is easy money for our players!!  If you just want to give $5 click here.  If you want to give $25 click here.  If you want to give $100 click here.  To see more perks look on the left side of the screen and scroll down.If you are interested in giving more we have all kinds of cool perks and prizes (including tickets to this years Breeders' Cup) for those who can afford more.  Plus, if you want to just leverage your network of friends - we have a contest where the people who refer the most friends and money will get cool prizes - the Grand Prize being tickets to next years Breeders Cup.  
We have been working for over a year to create our new game; we
took all of our learning, mounds of your feedback and game improvement ideas,
and produced this completely new version of ""Blazing Silks” called “High
Stakes Racing”.  We are very proud of this new game and it has improved
game-play in the areas you have come to love as well as many exciting new
elements that have been encouraged by our fan-base. 


The goal of this new game is to build the greatest horse racing
breeding and racing empire in our virtual world. It focuses on building a
bloodline over many generations to breed one or more ultimate Breeders’ Cup
Champions.

This game will have these key features, plus a whole lot more:


New core game “cycle” that
includes crafting and resource management. 
You can care, feed, train, and equip your horses and jockeys.  You can staff and maintain your farm.


Expanded racing challenges – with
over twenty gorgeous tracks and hundreds and hundreds of racing challenges  - the single player campaign will take months
to finish. 


Interactive Racing – we are going
to let you take the reins and see your favorite Breeders’ Cup tracks from the
best seat in the house.


Everything has been improved and made
more comprehensive: breeding, training, and preparing your horse and it’s race
strategy and tactics.


We have created a fun and immersive comic book
story-line, fully illustrated by our artists.

There are literally hundreds of enhancements and new game play – you can
read more below or watch our video.



*To learn more about our new game you
can go to our section below entitled: ""About the new version of our game""

Our goal is to bring our entire
horse racing world to mobile so you can sneak a quick game in anywhere whilst
you're pretending to pay attention to something else. In this day and age it’s
important to keep on top of the henchmen and keep those antagonists under
control. We felt that as a committed stable owner you would need access to your
empire at all times, even when you were on the go.
So, the mobile version of our
game is in the works.  You will be able to play it on your Android and
Apple devices and eventually your PC as well. 
We have decided to build this in “modules” and release components of the
game, as they are ready.  You will see below what our plan is and a little
preview of some of our prototypes.

*To learn more about our new game you can scroll down to our section below entitled: ""About our Future Mobile Racing and Handicapping Games""
We need your help, because as with all good planning, sometimes you cannot plan for those curve balls. Some of our engineers are based out in the Ukraine, who as we know is in contention with a big neighboring country; this caused all kinds of upheaval we just didn't plan for.  Nobody puts a regional military conflict contingency in his or her game project plan!But regardless of all that, we decided that rather than release a half-baked game on-budget, we would continue to our original plan and inject as much quality and features as we could; we asked our leadership and our team to defer pay and/or take pay cuts.  Our goal was to retain our entire team and if necessary help them avoid being sent out into a difficult economic and geopolitical environment. So we managed to blow through our estimates on the game and have used up all our pizza discount vouchers, we didn't win the state lottery as expected, and so we're out of cash!We need your help to get our horse over the finish line, so please just get behind us and give us a big push!
*To learn more about our budget and team, please go to the respective sections below entitled: ""Budget"" and ""Our Team"" 
We know that asking for money for
a Facebook and Mobile game is a big ""ask,"" so we are trying to give
you as much as we can back, by releasing our games for free and offering
lots of cool stuff.  This is kind of like you giving to us, and we give
back to you; or paying forward.  Another way to think of it is that you
are paying a discounted price for something you wanted anyway, and we're
throwing in some extra gifts to say thank you for your help.  Here is the
chart of perks you can get when you contribute:

In any case, with your help we
can release games for free, and continue to produce world-class horse racing
content. As an extra incentive we will give cool prizes to everyone who
plays the game for us achieving each higher level of funding as well as offer
really awesome prizes for those contributors who refer the most other people
and money.
*To learn more about our our perks and contribution levels, please scroll down to the bottom section entitled: ""Rewards""
In addition to trying to raise
$150,000 to finish our game, we have established several stretch goals,that if
we by chance raise more money, we will achieve with additional funds.  They include things like our full interactive
racing, mobile games and a lot more.

Plus, in addition to the stretch
goals above, our amazing artist, voice actors, and composers have offered to
donate free perks for everyone if we meet the following campaign goals:


Funded! $300,000 – We will
add a really awesome Las Vegas Downs to our new game free to everyone


Funded! $500,000 – We will
add a really awesome star collection mini-game to our Blazing Silks High Stake
Racing game


Funded! $750,000 – We will
add a really awesome Medyan Racetrack from Dubai to our new game free to everyone


Funded! $1,000,000  – We
will add this year’s Breeders’ Cup champions to all our games for breeding


Funded! $1,250,000 – We will
add a “Paddock” pre-race view to all our games to help you size up the
competition or to give a proper once over of the field before submitting your
picks


Funded! $1,500,000 – If we
reach this lofty goal we will install some cool player controlled features:
pre-race paddock “dance” moves for your horse, post-race jockey celebrations,
and of in-race photo taking to capture your highs and lows!












So everyone benefits by us reaching each successive level.

*To learn more about our our the Stretch Goals, please scroll down to the section entitled: ""Stretch Goals""


The more awareness we create, the
more money we will be able to raise, and we will be able to keep creating great
racing games and keep our awesome community growing.
We really need for you to get all
of your friends, colleagues, and neighbors to join in on our fun; so we are
going to give away three awesome prizes to the top three supporters who bring
in the most contributions using Indiegogo's sharing tools.  Therefore even
if you can't afford to contribute a lot yourself, you can still win a great
prize by recruiting other people to donate money through your own connections
and fundraising campaign.
We don't know exactly what the
prize will be, because we want it to be awesome and meaningful to our winner -
and we haven't figured out what the pinnacle of awesome is yet!  But we do
know one thing – the top prize will include tickets to next years
Breeders’ Cup weekend.  Second and third prizes will most certainly be something
like a super cool collectible or maybe a lead role in one of our future games,
or who knows...something even better we have not yet thought of.  In any
case it will be really cool and worth pursuing!
Please note - we cannot promise
that pair of roller skates you potentially wanted for your 5th birthday though.
There will be a twenty-referral minimum for a prize and we will be
measuring both the number of referral’s and the total amount contributed by
your referrals when selecting our winner. Remember, if you can't contribute and
want to go for this special prize be sure to create and Indiegogo account and
use their tools!




At I-Race we are big fans of horse racing.  However, we are even bigger fans of racehorses and we are committed to increasing the awareness and love of our sport and most importantly the beautiful equine participants.  Additionally, we are committed to the humane and loving treatment of these equine athletes during their career and in their retirement.  As such we really admire the efforts of the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation (TRF) and their affiliated companies. 
The TRF's mission is clear ""To save Thoroughbred horses no longer able to compete on the racetrack from possible neglect, abuse and slaughter.""  As explained on the TRF website, the sad truth is that a vast majority of the general public and even many racing fans are unaware of the sad fate that awaits thousands of Thoroughbreds each year. 
The reality is the training and racing community is only equipped financially to care and breed a small number of the horses bred each year for racing. The further reality is that horse meat is in high demand in many foreign countries and there are several slaughterhouses in the U.S., Canada and Mexico happy to create a supply.  It is a reality the TRF is determined to change and one we are hopeful we can help change as well.  
So we have decided that a percentage of every dollar raised will go directly to the TRF or one of it's affiliated companies.  You can learn more about the TRF and its efforts here.



Since our first beta game released our entire team has been blown away by the passion, interest, and support that so many of our players have expressed and given. Most importantly we are truly appreciative of the patience displayed and the thoughtful feedback given, as we ""learned"" how to make a better racing game. 
The journey to create our full Blazing Silks game began over a year ago with a customer survey that so many of you we're kind enough to provide your thorough, honest and provocative ideas. We have listened to your feedback and believe we are going to meet and exceed your expectations. We have stayed true to our cause, largely because we felt vested in you and our promise to make a better racing game than any that existed in the market.Thanks for reading, and we hope you'll consider investing in the future of Blazing Silks and I-Race. With your help we can continue to deliver exciting and fun racing games for everyone.






The goal of the new game is to
breed, race and train Breeders’ Cup Classic champion horses. This is
accomplished by developing a championship caliber bloodline by progressing
through the game, building a World class horse racing operation, training and
racing your horses to the top of the game’s leader-boards and continuing to
improve your horses generation after generation. 
The game has grown substantially
in size, with over 20 beautiful and recognizable tracks from around the world,
plus a compelling and immersive story driven single-player-game that will take
months of regular game-play to complete. 
Some of the highlights of the new
game-play elements are:


Expanded Stable ManagementWe felt that our original stable was
inadequate compared to the ambitions of our racing players.  We have therefore overhauled the old stables,
mucked them out, hosed them down and constructed a brand new stable
pristine management system. 



A New Mission System 

The new Blazing Silks mission
system gives our players a set of compact, direct, and increasingly challenging
goals to accomplish over the course of the game. They are purely
optional; and you can play the game any way you like, but
missions give rewards and should not overly tax your mouse finger.




Core Game Cycle

We have completely re-written our
core game-play and replaced our ""Challenges"" into two separate,
self-directed game-play elements: 1) a core management cycle of training,
caring, feed, managing, and equipping your horses and 2) global racing
challenges. 







Training Your Horses


Now you will have to build
your own “Training Centers” and improve them through crafting,
construction and sometimes invention. 
You will need to make constant choices how to actively train your
horse.  You must work harder for your
success; luckily we have made the work entertaining.







Racing Challenges
Blazing Silks
now features over 20 tracks from around the world that are unlocked as your
career progresses and features both single-player and multi-player races. Each
track has its own unique visual theme and provides beautiful vistas for you and
your horses!

Pre-Race Setup
Both our single-player and
multiplayer races have received significant interface enhancements to help
you better equip your horse and jockey, prepare for a race, set your race
tactics and importantly to understand the prospects of your horse entering a
race and what went right or wrong during an actual live race. 




Coming Soon! Interactive Racing
Most exciting to our serious fans
(who really want to “control” the action), coming soon to this version of the
game will be the ability to race in single-player and some multi-player interactive
races.  These races will have interactive
elements - the ""Urge"" button, direction controls, and pacing your
horse - that will allow players compete not only on their ability to train and
prepare their horses, but also based on their own digital dexterity!



Breeding 
We have dramatically improved
our breeding game-play.  In addition to
added control of the look and ability of your fillies and colts, we now allow you
to breed your own horses with horses owned by your friends
and acquaintances. Also, the importance of breeding to success in
the game has been expanded greatly, your bloodline will make your success, so breed
wisely!






New User Interface
While the game will look and feel
familiar, you will quickly see that we have completely overhauled the user
interface and tutorial to make the game more accessible and fun to play, with
gorgeous art throughout the game, and lots of nice buttons to press!


Achievements
We have created an entirely
new achievement system, so in addition to earning lots of gold coins in this
game, you can collect really cool achievement badges and earn extra status, as
well as gauge your progression and proficiency against your friends and foes






Helping and Gifting
There are so many exciting
elements to this new game it would take us a month just to list them here, so
just like in the game where you can have your friends help and gift you needed
items, we will use that month to ask you to help and send us a gift!

Comic book Story-line


Finally, we have introduced
a multi-layered storyline, where you are the ""hero"" and need to help
your sister and father return the family racing business to the pinnacle of
racing. You will be challenged along the way by your families arch-nemesis and
a host of other antagonists getting in your way at every opportunity. 
Our artists
have created some beautiful comic panels for you to enjoy throughout the game,
can you spot the antagonist, henchman and evil arch nemesis in the panels
below? Don't worry there will be plenty of opportunity to get to know these
characters and the true extent of their in-game conniving evilness as you play.

















Before we launch our full game, we
plan to launch three unique mobile horse racing games, each one with its own
set of skills to master. Some of you players revel in the chance to be in the
saddle and steering your horse to victory, if so then Peer-to-Peer racing game
will be for you. It's kind of a ""Mario Cart"" but with horses and
other vital trademark infringement avoiding differences. Actually it’s more
serious and realistic than Mario Cart could ever be, (we have not yet seen a
plumber in a cart in red dungarees on the road, but then the world is a big place, so perhaps one day).
Perhaps you relish the owning and
training gameplay of our Facebook game and would like to try your hand at our “Owners
Club”.  Or perhaps you feel that your
skills lie in picking a winner, and the wagering of in-game gold coins is your
calling, in which case you will want to try our for-fun wagering game “ Blazing
Silks – Stake your Claim” (working title).
Peer-to-Peer Racing





Here is a short video of our P2P
racing prototype. Please do not ask why we have a race venue called hot
chocolate, these things happened during prototypes.. Our player jumps in and expertly weaves through the pack,
before using boost to get ahead and completely thrash our other players in
the match! What fun! 
You'll be able to race at any of
our tracks, in your chosen racing silks and horse, and choose from a
variety of different camera perspectives - although we all like jockey cam the
best! With up to 10 players at once from around the world you could be
racing to win or at least disrupt your friend’s hehe... Steward!!



Owners Club





Well if the life of a virtual
jockey isn't for you, maybe you'd be better at the helm of your own farm.
Owners club continues where Blazing Silks leaves off with you expertly managing
your way to further success and riches in a simplified mobile game environment.
You can still race at your favorite tracks and enjoy looking after your horses
to win game currency and rewards.



For-fun Wagering





And you can try your hand at
virtual wagering, use your skills to expertly handicap the race and try to win a
fortune in gold coins. Of course if you lose your virtual shirt you can always
go and do a bit of virtual jockey work on our P2P game or help out at the
Owners Club to earn some more coins.








We don't want to let ""the
horse out of the barn"" too early on this one but we have some very cool
Game designs that will blend some of the most popular casual gameplay with our
exciting 3-D horseracing.  You'll have to excuse our vagueness about these
titles, but we want to keep our ""cards close to our vest"" at this
time.  We promise you'll be excited by these fun and entertaining Games.





The Base Budget is $150,000 to
launch “Blazing Silks – High Stakes Racing” game on Facebook.  Below is how that money is utilized:






30% - Graphics, Design and Music - 

We have some amazing artists on
our team and you are going to love the look, the characters and the music in
our game.  They have done a fantastic
job, and created a stunning and massive world for our. Our 3D horse racing
assets alone exceed 40Gb, and the massive amount of effort we spent creating
the new tracks is evident in every race you run. 


 35% - Programming - 
our engineers are seasoned
industry professionals, dedicated to creative coding. Code is written for the
servers that sit in the back doing the number crunching, the web clients that
you play on, and the 3D system that delivers you the racing.  In this massive game these guys have done a
great job bringing it all together.


10% - Quality Assurance  - 
No game leaves the stable
without going through rigorous QA. What this means is our QA team literally
play the game from start to finish many, many times; covering the full breadth
and depth of gameplay, playing with different spending and play strategies, all
the while collecting bugs to fix, and recommendations on balance. It is a huge
task with a game of this size.  


10% - Administrative  - 
We really don’t have an
admin team – Marcus, Jonathan and Alex really deal with everything an
administrative team would do at most companies, but we do have administrative
overhead like office expenses, travel, supplies, equipment etc.


10% - Crowdfunding Cost - Ironic that asking for money
costs money, gone are the days of trading a couple of goats for some software,
now we must (happily) pay Indiegogo for this campaign and manage the fulfillment
of all the really cool perks listed below. 
All out of a budget which is already blown.


5% - Other / TRF - 
And finally no budget is
complete without that contingency and sundry costs or in this case our donation
to TRF (N.B. This does not include natural disasters, conflicts, rebellions or
invasion from another world). ""Pizzas don't grow on trees"" as one programmer expressed his need for a regular salary.

We would like to keep Spina Technologies and our Blazing Silks games growing as long as possible; so here is what we are planning to do if we manage to exceed our initial goal to keep your horses battling it out on the track:

If we managed to raise $300 thousand in total we will release interactive racing as a new form of in-game racing for everyone leveraging our ambitions in the mobile arena, you will be able to take jockey control in the game if that is your thing.



""You're mine Contagious Dancer!... Now I am in control! ..This time there is no escape... wait... waaaaait... noooo... Next time Contagious Dancer.. next time there will be no escape...""



If we manage to raise $500,000 we will release the ""mini"" mobile game called ""Blazing Silks - High Stakes Edition"" that will enable you to race in single player and multiplayer races, as well as participate in interactive racing contest while you're on the move with your IOS or Android phone or tablet.

\""Ah Contagious Dancer... we meet again... I have been waiting...darn it.. I'm last again!!... ""
If we manage to raise $750,000 we will release a casual mobile game for your IOS or Android phone or tablet.  The prototype for this game has already been built, but we are keeping the concept in ""stealth"" mode until we are closer to release.As an added bonus Contagious Dancer  will also be banned from playing this game. (Hope this gets through the campaign edit- Illustrious Mule Owner)
If we manage to raise $1,000,000 we will release the full version of Blazing Silks on mobile for your IOS or Android phone or tablet, and for a limited period of time it will be free to download for everyone. This game will include all the single player and multi-player gameplay in an easy to access mobile format. 


If we manage to raise $1,250,000 we will release an expansion pack and standalone mobile application that let's you pick the winners of our multi-player races and participate in virtual goods and handicapping contests.  This will be a very fun, as casual or complex ""as you want it"" horse race ""Pick-em"" game.

If we manage to raise $1,500,000 we will release super-high-quality-graphical version of our full Blazing Silks game meant to be played either on your home computer's browser or as a stand-alone application downloaded on Steam.  Anything beyond this will be invested in the marketing or increasing the quality and scope of these game, or related expansion packs and mini-games. 


So if you are wondering what goodies you get for helping us finish our games - here they are: (we probably should have told you this first!)


In game currency is a fabulous thing – it allows you to buy fantastic equipment for your horse and jockeys, it will help you grow your racing empire faster, it also is useful when you run out of critical things like energy, spirit, and food! It's made of real virtual gold.

We are making several really cool mobile games: a peer-to-peer interactive racing game, a for-fun handicapping and wagering game, a full version of Blazing Silks on mobile, and a top-secret casual horse racing themed game. We are offering free versions 1, 2, or all of these games based on which “Perk” level you choose.

Our artists usually get all the acclaim, but our game composer is truly the prodigy of our team.  You may only hear glimpses of our soundtrack in the background of our game, but why not make the full versions of these songs the soundtrack of your life instead of that dismal Mahler symphony you keep listening to, no offense but it is really depressing...

Don’t tell our artists, but we have taken their best work and created a beautiful digital book showing the creative process unfolding and giving you more than a glimpse into the artistic development of our in-game characters and horses.

Everyone wants one.  Until now – nobody could have one.  Get your very own white horse to race and breed with.  In fact create as many white horses as you want.  It will turn every head in the game and leave them wondering – how do I get one?  Well they can’t unless they buy the right tiers in our Indiegogo campaign!


Don’t assume because you start
our current game by breeding with a Breeders’ Cup Legend, that in our new game
you get to do the same.  In the new game, you will need to be well on your
way to greatness before you get even a glimpse of these horses and then you are
going to need a good portion of Fort Knox to cover the stud fees.  But if
you buy a tier with this perk included you will get a champion horse in your
stable from the start to breed with…. oh think of the possibilities!!

If we had a dollar for every time someone phoned us up and asked us for a “Blazing Silks Pint Glass”…well, let’s just say we still would need to run this Indiegogo campaign. But we know our fans like a little hops to make their horses run faster.  Get your own set of 4 Pint Glasses by choosing the right beer tier.



Get yourself a one-of-a-kind
Blazing Silks bobble head horse for your vehicle or wobbly item to project your
interest in the noble sport of horse racing. Yes, it can be one of your horses
and will have your horses name inscribed on the base.  Please note however
your bobble head horse is a gelding so it is a waste of time to try to breed
them with other bobble headed horses to produce bobble head fillies and colts. (N.B.
Bobble head horse food must be purchased separately.)

Our graphic designers and artists can sometimes be persuaded to sign their work and this is an exclusive chance to get a unique signed piece of artwork to decorate your own horse racing shrine with. Grab one of these now as they are limited editions, and only available because we promised our artists pizza and shelter for making them.

This gets you a back stage pass to our closed Beta of the new game, be one of the first to learn the ropes and get a head start on everyone prior to the game being released. We cannot transfer your earnings in the Beta game to the live game, but you will have something much more valuable - experience and knowledge, our new game is quite different to the original Blazing Silks and there is a lot to learn for a new player!


Ever wanted to make your
mark on gaming history, and be directly involved in what is set to be the
world's premiere online racing experience on Facebook and mobile? This perk
offers you just that by giving you the chance to be involved in the design
phase of our next three mobile games, providing exclusive behind-the-scenes
access to the screens and gameplay as they are produced, giving your input to
the team and acknowledged on the game credits. 
You will get to personally interact with and thought partner with
Jonathan, Marcus and our design team.

This perk gets you a brand new exclusive set of Blazing Silks racing silks sent to you, but of course we cannot guarantee that they will fit you!  They will be your “stables” silks and have your farm name on them!

Digital immortality awaits you as our skilled artists will convert your approved* provided photograph into an in-game cartoon star!  Your digital self will help thousands of players play the game and you can choose whether you want to be a hired Jockey, Trainer, or farm Staff in our games

We have the best seats at the best race of the year…literally! Before they were even open to the public, our friends at the Breeders’ Cup gave us first choice of seats at Keeneland (Kentucky) for this year’s Championship Weekend.  We have five pairs of tickets we are offering to you.  If you want to look them up, they are Section K, Rows B or C!  There literally is no better view in the Reserved Grandstands.  From here you have a direct view of the final stretch, the finish line and the winners circle.  You will be seated among movie stars, a group of Blazing Silks fans, and who knows you might end up sitting between our CEO and one the BC’s Ambassadors like Bobby Flay or Kate Upton! (http://www.breederscup.com/experience/celebrities )For each donation at this tier we will give you a pair of reserved grandstand seats for both weekend races.  We will also provide you access to special clubs, events, and give you a $100 wagering voucher. 
You don't have a lot of time to secure these so better move quickly, the Breeders' Cup is just around the corner, if you want to go - gettem!
If you want to attend the 2016 Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita in style, then this is the way to go.  This “Experience” package includes complimentary tickets for 2 persons to the 2016 Breeders' Cup Championships at Santa Anita in Pasadena, CA.  We will provide hotel accommodations, limousine transport from your hotel to the event, VIP Access to cool party's, track clubs. We will also provide a private tour of backside where you can meet the trainers and jockeys competing in the event.  We will also provide dining, drink and wagering vouchers to make sure that you are in tip-top shape for all the festivities.  While the tickets won’t be available to us until January, just like this year, we will be able to get some of the best seats in the house.  So you will get to rub elbows with Hollywood’s finest and maybe event the former governor of Cal-e-forn-e-a!

You’ll also get $5 worth of in-game currency!Five bucks gets you even more gratitude for helping make Blazing Silks a reality.

Intro
Let's get this intro out of the way shall we? I'm a 21 year old writer with no job but a wide imagination, so far I have written purely for my own hobby and have finally decided to turn a story into a video game.This video game will be using a 2D engine to create a game that yes ""looks like a pokemon game"" but with intense battles, an epic story and plenty of fun things to do.This funding will go towards a video game created by me and a few other artists, but this funding won't be able to get you anything of worth, it's simply a means to get started. If successfully funded I will have enough to hire someone for enough music for a trailer, enough art for a bit of character design and the start of a true video game.If I haven't scared you away yet, then let's get this project on the road to success.
What this is really isShadows of Imeria is a 2D, turn based adventure game with many never before seen plot twists, puzzles, characters, dungeons, monsters and a badass villain with no redeemable qualities.Sure it may sound like plenty of games with the same kind of pitch, but this will immerse you completely into a new world, one of evil, one of wonder and one of adventure!Story

Shadows of Imeria is set in a mystical world full of magic and wonder, terrifying creatures, bad guys and puzzles that may take a few minutes hurting your head.You take on the role of a military general who fled the capital after witnessing it's evil, but along the way you are ambushed by hired assassins and during the attack you suffer fatal injuries which leads to amnesia.On a journey to retrieve your memories you come across many people along the way, both enemy and ally. Your decisions can shape the world around you, so choose wisely.

What the money goes toward
If successful, the funds received from this campaign will bring some characters to life with waist up portraits, background music will go into a few of the first maps, along with some extra music for unique events.
Some enemies will be designed, the UI will have a lot of work done to it like the menu screen, equip, inventory, shop and other parts worked in.In short it should almost give me enough to make a lengthy trailer to show off everything.

Is it worth it?
This is the question you are asking yourself at the moment, there's no video, there isn't a shred of proof that this money will go towards what I say it will, but it is worth it.With this money (and if extra is raised), I will be able to start my journey to create an adventure that can be experienced by you! You will get updates on the development progress, characters as they are added and you will be invited to back the future project that will completely decide this games well.. Future.
  Without you..
This campaign, this project, won't be able to go anywhere without you, the people helping my dreams reach into our reality.If you're a nostalgic gamer and love those turn based RPG's or just want a nice flowing old school game that's brimming with excitement, then funding this won't be a waste.   What will stop this?

This project doesn't come without risks and challenges.If prices are raised by people I am hiring due to financial issues, if I suffer financial issues or if the world descends into chaos, then this project will either be postponed or cancelled.To bypass these (All except for the whole chaos thing), I will hire respectable and trustworthy people who have a good track record, and my own money will be budgeted even tighter than usual so that I have all the extra money I need to survive.

<a href=""http://celticmythpodshow.com/blog/a-review-of-ard-ri-a-celtic-card-game/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Review of Ard Rí – a Celtic Card Game (written by Gary, 18 June 2015)</a><br/> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>About the Game</h3>ARD RÍ is a 2 to 5 player strategic competitive card game, designed for players ages 14 and up. Average game-play time is 30 to 60 minutes. The rules are provided in two versions: one with all English terms, and one with Gaelic terms.<p>In the game, players take on the role of ancient Gaelic warlords and compete among each other to collect the most wealth in order to force the other players to acknowledge them as the ARD RÍ (i.e. the High King).</p>
<p>There are two different types of cards in the game: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cattle cards, represented by the numbered cards and the Aces, and </li>
<li>Warrior Cards, represented by the Court cards (i.e. Jacks, Queens, Kings) </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cattle cards</b> are synonymous with wealth and are worth the number represented on the card. For example, a 10 is worth 10 cattle-points, and a 4 is worth 4 cattle-points. Aces each represent a Bull and are worth 15 cattle-points apiece. The different suits represent different types of cattle. Cattle cards are played face-up into a player’s <i>gort </i>(i.e. their cattle-field). This is the open area in front of each player. </p>
<p><b>Warrior cards</b> are ranked such that Kings will defeat Queens and Jacks in battle, and Queens will defeat Jacks. When cards of equal rank battle, both are killed. Warrior Cards are initially played face-down into a player’s Roundhouse, which is the open area adjacent to a player's<i>gort</i>. When they have proven themselves in Raiding or Defense, warriors are turned face-up and are considered ""Proven"". Proven warriors provide the player who controls them with additional benefits (though they also come with additional restrictions).</p>
<p><b>The game round</b>: Play progresses through the seasons of the year, with each season providing players with the opportunity to engage in specified actions. For instance, Cattle are added to a player’s wealth in Spring, with Warriors flocking to banners in the Summer. Wealth is acquired from the wilds during the harvest time of Autumn, with the Harvest Feast of Samhain occurring at the end of that season. At the Harvest Feast, players are required to feed those Warriors they wish to remain under their banner. Winter is a time of hunting, raiding, and politicking, when fortunes can change in a heartbeat. </p>
<p>Play continues until one player accumulates enough wealth or warriors to force the issue and cause the others to acknowledge them as High King. </p>
<p><b>The game comes with three editions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>a Children's Edition (designed for children ages 5 to 13), </li>
<li>the Basic game (described above), &amp; </li>
<li>an Advanced Edition which features special powers for each of the figures displayed on the Jacks, Queens, &amp; Kings - drawn directly from the mythology.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Please note that while 1 deck can support a 2-player game, we recommend 2 decks for games of 3 to 4 players, and 3 decks for 5-player games.</i></p>
<br/><h3>About the Cards</h3>
<div>Each of our decks in this series contains imagery hand-drawn from the history and mythology of the Celts, presenting illuminations rich with symbolism. The first two decks were printed and delivered to our crowdfunding backers last year (to whom we offer our deep gratitude). This final deck features vertically symmetrical (i.e. two-way) designs for the face-cards and back which showcase the more chaotic and elemental forces of Celtic legend and cosmology.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our cards are uncommon in that our artist, James Acken (PhD in Medieval Studies), has used his background as both a scholar and artist to draw these images, creating a detailed tapestry of symbolism throughout.</p>
<p>While the usual suits are recognizable in our deck, we present them as the four jewels of the<i>Tuatha Dé Danann</i>, magical items of immense power representing among other things martial prowess, wealth, abundance, and leadership.<br/></p>

Now we are completing that set with our final deck suggestive of the wild, chthonic forces of nature as opposed to the stabilizing, societal forces represented in our second deck. We've also designed an altogether new game, designed for use with our decks and capturing the heroic spirit of early society in Celtic Europe. 



Lugh and Balor, the embattled grandson and grandparent from the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh, are shown in opposition to one another on the King of Clubs in each of the three decks. 

Lugh with his unstoppable spear and Balor with his irresistibly poisonous gaze.

Third-Party Reviews

Immediately below are two reviews of the cards and the game:

   Article written by Will James, 7 June 2015


A Review of Ard Rí – a Celtic Card Game (written by Gary, 18 June 2015)   

About the GameARD RÍ is a 2 to 5 player strategic competitive card game, designed for players ages 14 and up. Average game-play time is 30 to 60 minutes. The rules are provided in two versions: one with all English terms, and one with Gaelic terms.In the game, players take on the role of ancient Gaelic warlords and compete among each other to collect the most wealth in order to force the other players to acknowledge them as the ARD RÍ (i.e. the High King).
There are two different types of cards in the game: 

Cattle cards, represented by the numbered cards and the Aces, and 
Warrior Cards, represented by the Court cards (i.e. Jacks, Queens, Kings) 

Cattle cards are synonymous with wealth and are worth the number represented on the card. For example, a 10 is worth 10 cattle-points, and a 4 is worth 4 cattle-points. Aces each represent a Bull and are worth 15 cattle-points apiece. The different suits represent different types of cattle. Cattle cards are played face-up into a player’s gort (i.e. their cattle-field). This is the open area in front of each player.

Warrior Cards are initially played face-down into a player’s Roundhouse, which is the open area adjacent to a player'sgort. When they have proven themselves in Raiding or Defense, warriors are turned face-up and are considered ""Proven"". Proven warriors provide the player who controls them with additional benefits (though they also come with additional restrictions).
The game round: Play progresses through the seasons of the year, with each season providing players with the opportunity to engage in specified actions. For instance, Cattle are added to a player’s wealth in Spring, with Warriors flocking to banners in the Summer. Wealth is acquired from the wilds during the harvest time of Autumn, with the Harvest Feast of Samhain occurring at the end of that season. At the Harvest Feast, players are required to feed those Warriors they wish to remain under their banner. Winter is a time of hunting, raiding, and politicking, when fortunes can change in a heartbeat. 
Play continues until one player accumulates enough wealth or warriors to force the issue and cause the others to acknowledge them as High King. 
The game comes with three editions:

a Children's Edition (designed for children ages 5 to 13), 
the Basic game (described above), & 
an Advanced Edition which features special powers for each of the figures displayed on the Jacks, Queens, & Kings - drawn directly from the mythology.

Please note that while 1 deck can support a 2-player game, we recommend 2 decks for games of 3 to 4 players, and 3 decks for 5-player games.
About the Cards
Each of our decks in this series contains imagery hand-drawn from the history and mythology of the Celts, presenting illuminations rich with symbolism. The first two decks were printed and delivered to our crowdfunding backers last year (to whom we offer our deep gratitude). This final deck features vertically symmetrical (i.e. two-way) designs for the face-cards and back which showcase the more chaotic and elemental forces of Celtic legend and cosmology.


Our cards are uncommon in that our artist, James Acken (PhD in Medieval Studies), has used his background as both a scholar and artist to draw these images, creating a detailed tapestry of symbolism throughout.
While the usual suits are recognizable in our deck, we present them as the four jewels of theTuatha Dé Danann, magical items of immense power representing among other things martial prowess, wealth, abundance, and leadership.



Additionally, each Court card represents important figures from the Book of Invasions, Colloquy of the Ancients, and other medieval legends in an effort to evoke the highly involved symbolism of the Book Kells and other medieval artifacts. 

As with the prior two decks we successfully crowdfunded, this deck will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC) and will contain:  

a custom back,
12 custom-designed Court Cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings),
36 custom-designed pip cards (unique to the set, but common across it) ,
4 custom-designed Aces (unique to the set, but common across it),
2 custom-designed Jokers, and  
1 info card concerning the company or, possibly, a custom-designed Cut Card 
1 info card detailing the symbolism of the card back and where one can go to find more information (www.culturlan.com).

Risks & Challenges 
We've successfully funded and printed two decks of Bicycle branded playing cards and we have a very good handle on the process. Additionally, we are working with great people at the USPCC Custom Division to print these decks. To top things off, the game has been playtested extensively and almost all of the card artwork is finished; we are simply waiting on the funds to go to print.
All of that said, there is always the chance of an unexpected delay.
We will work hard to ensure no delays occur, but should we at any point believe we are behind schedule, we promise to advise you of the issue and what we are doing to resolve it. We also promise to stay in contact with you at least once per week until project rewards are shipped. And if the project is funded, rewards WILL be shipped.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Our core game team consists of 7 people. We work at a Haug-land, a company that primarily develops software for logistics and manufacturing companies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The reason why we make games from the aviation environment is because we love flying in real life, we love airport logistics, and generally all about airplanes. We even have our own flight simulators (Boeing 737, Cessna and a Robinson helicopter) under the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/flyboysflightsimulatorcenter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FlyBoys</a> brand.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We managed to make AirportPRG thanks to our passion. We put aside other commercial projects, sometimes (quite often :) working overtimes and on weekends. We wanted to know if we can make games, and if people are interested in what we make.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It turns out people really like what we make, and with your support, we'll be able to take everything one step further and create a game unlike any other.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Currently we're working on the game in our free time and from our point of view, the development is extremely slow. Most of the time that could be spent on the game is now spent on other commercial projects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Reaching our goal will massively speed up the development of the game because we'll be able to dedicate part of our team to work on the game full-time, and put our hearts and souls into it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We estimate that if we reach our goal, the schedule will look like this:</p>

On big airports, upgrading gates will also allow for levels of automation, where staff know how to handle airplanes even without your guidance. It will allow you to have dozens of gates on your airport. Manual gameplay however will always remain the fastest and most efficient method of handling airplanes.
 
CONNECT AIRLINES WITH OTHERS

Get your own airline, buy and manage airplanes and establish airport connections with other players. Be a apart of a global economy and fly airplanes to and from airports owned by both real players and AI.
Handle airplanes fast and responsibly to grow your airport's prestige, and consequently get opportunities to fly planes to more attractive and more lucrative destinations.
 
LOOK AND FEEL

We're aiming for a recognisable art style for World of Airports. But more than that, the game will feature full day/night cycle, along with various weather conditions, which affect the way the game looks, but also plays. In winter, you'll need to de-ice airplanes, fog might make it difficult for planes to land, and so on.
 
TECHNOLOGY

In World of Airports we're accounting for a nearly indefinite airport growth from the very beginning and we're fully prepared for huge airport traffic with hundreds of airplanes and facility vehicles.
We're building the game already optimised in terms of game mechanics and graphics as well, so that when the game releases on Android and iOS, you'll get great performance on your device.
 
ABOUT THE TEAM

Our core game team consists of 7 people. We work at a Haug-land, a company that primarily develops software for logistics and manufacturing companies.
The reason why we make games from the aviation environment is because we love flying in real life, we love airport logistics, and generally all about airplanes. We even have our own flight simulators (Boeing 737, Cessna and a Robinson helicopter) under the FlyBoys brand.
We managed to make AirportPRG thanks to our passion. We put aside other commercial projects, sometimes (quite often :) working overtimes and on weekends. We wanted to know if we can make games, and if people are interested in what we make.
It turns out people really like what we make, and with your support, we'll be able to take everything one step further and create a game unlike any other.
 
FUNDING
""The goal is to keep our games free-to-play and ad-free.""

Currently we're working on the game in our free time and from our point of view, the development is extremely slow. Most of the time that could be spent on the game is now spent on other commercial projects.
Reaching our goal will massively speed up the development of the game because we'll be able to dedicate part of our team to work on the game full-time, and put our hearts and souls into it.
We estimate that if we reach our goal, the schedule will look like this:

Well, with mental health apps it is even harder to get people to stick to their online therapy: illnesses like depression that takes away the joy in peoples lives, leaving them with low motivation and sometimes cognitive impairment. But there is a solution: research shows that the gamification of digital therapy keeps users interested and engaged!It’s not an easy project, but with PsycApps’ team of psychologists and the developers from Collision Studios – the same company that helped develop the ‘Game of Thrones’, ‘The Walking Dead’ and many more games – we have the unique mix of academic and gaming experience to change therapy forever.Your support of this campaign will help us finance the implementation of the AI that our budget just couldn’t stem anymore.

Andrew Here. I am posting this video showing game play footage of one of our early alpha builds so you can see the rough direction we are wanting to go. This is an early alpha build in fact we have replaced all the art work with new stuff. I hope to showcase some of the art work next week. Also please check our Gallery in the Indiegogo for more videos that we have made.<br/></p><h3>
</h3><h3> -Path of Meep: Added 3/24/2016-
</h3>
<br/>
<p>The Path of Meep is one
of two years struggling to make it to this point. We are not merely
wandering around in circles with no design or idea for what we want
to do with this game.</p>
<p>Meep the Legendary Spacebat is a return to the 2 dimensional ""Space Shooter"".  If you were not around in the mid 90s, a ""Space Shooter"" is
a game in which you play a ship or robot of some sort and fly
around. You try to dodge things that can kill you in one or two shots, gaining power-ups by blowing the bad guys out of the sky. Traditional ""Space Shooters"" usually have enemies that follow a pattern and don't
react to the player. Even
before enemies are
programmed into the game, we plan them out so that way we can make the game have a good replay
value. We do this by
figuring out what
the most common pattern would be then trying to mess with it.
</p>
<p>We have actually engineered locations where a boss or mob could be
put in. Indeed all of the power ups I created were specifically
designed to showcase what we could do. The thing is, when you have 5
to 6 minutes to showcase a game and talk about all the things in it
you can't really hit all that. Being concise has the price of skipping
over a lot of details. In the video I say, “I love the art of it
all.” That is 100% true, but what I don't go into that much is why.</p>
<p>When I was a younger man I was one of those guys who played around
in Arcades a lot in the 80's. What always bothered me is on the
side of the arcade box the art is around 10 times better than in the actual game. As the games got better people started experimenting with
polygon counts and such and the arcade faded. In my initial attempt
to do this game we had a demo.  You will notice that demo being played
in the video.</p>
<p>As you read this, Margo is currently finishing up or has finished
up if you're reading this after the 28th of next week-Full upgrades
to everything you saw in the video. All the artwork you saw in the video
after the game play point illustrates the changes. See, when we last
showcased this game we had something that was of quality that quite
frankly we probably could have made a small app out of.</p>
<p>I don't want to make a cash grab out of this.  My objective is to
use the fact that we can actually have hand drawn animations in video
games to its fullest. Reactionary and pattern based AI Enemies instead of something that just follows a pattern or something that
just reacts, why not both?  That sort of AI exists in modern action
games, beat-em-ups and FPS games but not in ""Space Shooters"".  If these exist in ""Space Shooters"", they are well hidden, or reserved for bosses.</p>
<p>I want to introduce elements such as evolving weapons, and using points
like how some M.O.B.A.s use gold or coins.  The idea being when you go through the
game you can have multiple different play styles. Meep can hold up to
4 weapons at a given time and store weapons in Echo's Shop. One of the
first additional weapons we came up with, was the knife launcher which
turns the basic attack from a rapid fire fireball into a rapid fire
knife launcher that while it does less damage then the basic Meep
shot, it goes through enemies using the same pattern. Meaning
unlike the Meep shot, it can deal with crowds faster.</p>
<p>Plus, you are now a bat, in space, with a knife, that is on fire with
blue flames. Meep's game play is going to have two types-infinite enemy and boss rushes like Meeppocolapse.  Then there
is the main game play which is more like the traditional 2D dog
fights and follows the story though around 8 levels, including but not
exclusive to: Castle Raids, Ship Battles, Forest on fire, Duels with
Magic wielding heroes that mistake you for an intruder, Epic fights
involving Meep vs an automatic Vacuum Cleaner that has a laser
gatling gun security protocol. Falling down into the core of a planet
and much more!</p>
<p>When I wrote the game, I specifically left the environments open in
certain areas so people could fill those open spaces in with unique
OCs fighting in epic duels to keep back the army (or maybe being part
of the army) as Meep pushes forward through the chaos.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, this game is about giving a fully
animated, artistic, and fun game to the library of games.  Giving
another option to people who like the ""Space Shooter"" genre. I want to
push some of the new ideas and philosophies in gaming, and use those
to improve on the ""Space Shooter"" model. I like Toho, I like games like
Ikuruga, that’s fine... but I really wish there was a ""Space Shooter"" that had a Castlevania style old school pacing and as I am currently
not aware of one, my objective is to bring it into existence. Games
like Castlevania and Super Ghouls and Ghosts were tough as nails not
because of so much on the screen.</p>
<p>Alexander our programmer has never had a chance to practice his craft, so I am giving
him a place to start growing his portfolio and he is happy to help us
out. As I type this, Alexander is working hard on formulas, code
and implementation.  So between him and the other artists on the
team, I am happy and look forward to seeing a lot of cool designs come
to life.  The stage progression is wonderful and I look forward to
watching it grow. It is often said but I mean this, sincerely, I hope
you look forward to this as much as I do.  Together for great cupcakes
and so I can entertain, and create a great game for all of you to
play! Lets walk the Path of Meep Together!</p><br/><h3>We are Misunderstood Creature Entertainment (MCE)</h3><div>What is that?</div>
<p>Misunderstood
Creature Entertainment or M.C.E is a young gaming company. We wanted
to do this project 1 year ago, but when we looked at our product at the time, we realized we could do better after further development.  Now, 1 year later, we have
acquired a stable team ready to design a great game for you. We hope
to succeed so we can design even more games in the future.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Hopes</h3><br/><ul>
<li>
<p>
	We
	are hoping to not just build a good game, but something great. I
	would say epic but to me that word is used so much it has lost its
	punch. As Gamers ourselves some of us have noticed a sad fact:  Unless you are a fan of bullet hell games Space shooters are
	practically dead. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Why is this?  Well it's because this genre really hasn't seen much advancement compared to all the other genres of gaming so prevalent in today's design world. While it is great to have good consistent designs, what if I want something different?  That's where MCE
	came up with the idea to take the initiative, and instead of waiting
	for that next great game to come-actually go out and make it.  </p></li>
<li><p>We as a team have worked day in and day out towards this dream.  Now, we need your
	help not only because it is important to us to be able to work on this, but because we want to get this game developed and out there for
	everyone to enjoy as soon as possible. </p></li>
</ul><div><br/></div><div><h3>Our Success and What it Means</h3></div><div><br/></div><ul>
<li>
<p>
	By
	this Indiegogo succeeding we will be able to successfully fund the
	necessary people to work full time on this project and give it their full attention without having to concern themselves with part time
	work. In short by this being successfully funded you are allowing
	the artists, programmers and workers the ability to do their craft
	and produce for you a great product: A space shooter that  has
	full hand drawn animation, as well as enemy AI patterns and team attacks which make the player pay attention to more than the bullet
	locations on the screen. Having to fire and engage in 2D dog-fights
	in the sky with a variety of enemies: melee, ranged, even enemies that will try to trap the Player. This mixes with varied and multiple play
	styles with a variety of weapons to provide a challenging 2D Space Shooter Experience.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Back
	when we demoed the proof of concept, I would sometimes notice people
	try to camp in one location on the left hand side of the screen.  They
	would die very shortly after.  However when they actually moved around
	and engaged the game they did very good.  This means a lot to me because that's the sort of feeling I want out of a space shooter.  I want to
	fire my attacks off and take out many enemies yes, but I also want to
	have to problem solve against enemy AI. I feel that while the space
	shooter genre has produced a lot of fun games, most of the enemy challenge comes from the sheer quantity of bullets and effects they produce in any given level, rather than a tactical challenge. While this is a game-play
	style I like a lot, I don't feel it's the only thing the genre can do.  So in Meep our goal is to present adversaries with unique advantages and disadvantages to the
	enemy AI patterns used. In addition we seek to support a protocol for encountering  other enemies at certain positions on the field and unleashing team up moves
	to change up the pace once in a while on the player. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Everyone
	on this team wants to do this full time and give it their all but we
	need financial support to make that happen and that's where you come
	in.  </p>

allowing them to give their full attention to this project free of

<p>Shawn
 Meadows  is our background artist.  He has trained his entire life
dedicating himself to making great and dynamic looking art
backgrounds. He has worked on small commission projects which he successfully finished with our animator Margo Hopper. Thus they know how to compliment each others' style perfectly.  Anyone
whose anyone knows how important and impressive it is to have a
background artist who can compliment the art of your entities and
things in front of them. It's sometimes distracting for a person to be
playing a game where the art in the front is a clearly pixelated
chibi sprite, but the background looks like a  work from Leonardo Da
Vinci. </p><p>I wanted the styles to match, so when I heard from miss Hopper
that she knew someone who could  fill in, I tested them out
with a new space background.  </p><p>What I got back was dynamic.  It wasn't just the
little white stars no, this was some multi-color, dynamic space
background with some images already prepared to enable our programmer to do some
depth tricks and I was floored. Naturally of course, I then decided to
hire him on.</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><h3>Margo Hopper: Animator </h3>
<br/><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Margo’s
style is exceptional and blossoming.  While working with us, she has increased from
12 frames of animation, to being able to go up to 60 frames of animation.  Margo
has a really nice, dynamic cartoon style that fits perfectly in front
of the style that Sean uses.  </span></p>
<p>
Margo
is an experienced artist, however this is her first big animation
project. Most of her animations are 7-12 min shorts on commission work.
  As such, for the past year I've seen her grow and both of us
can't wait to have you exposed to the improvements in her style and
technique.   Like with Sean, Margo is an artist committed to this
project's success as is everyone on this team.  </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Kris ""The Alexander"" Myers:  Programming</h3><br/>
<p>
Next, there is Kris ""the Alexander"" Myers, our current
main programmer. He is well versed in HTML and JavaScript. He also
thinks sideways.  Don't understand what I mean? Allow me to explain - he's the type of guy who
when he tests a game's code, goes out of his way to break it so he can
then rebuild it better. In short, exactly what you'd want in a programmer. </p><p>A college graduate and dedicated to make this
project work, he has all the tools necessary to program a Game for PC
or Mac. He is currently a father right now so he's got one of his
dreams, but another dream of his was to be a game programmer. </p><p>W<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">ell folks, I
say let's give it to him and watch him soar! Alexander wants to work
more on this then he is currently, but again we need YOU to do that.</span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Conrad: A Man of Many Voices</h3><br/>
<p>Then
there is Conrad who does really great voice work. Conrad is on the
level of Chuck Avery but he's not as known. He can do over 100 tones, accents and voice types!  No I'm not exaggerating.  He is really
good at bringing characters to life.  In fact when we demoed the

surprised or told me ""No way!"" when I told them that every voice in the

<br/><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Myself, I'm Harry Thompson.  I designed Meep the Spacebat for MCE.  The enemy
patterns and the storyboard ideas are pretty much based on the
designs I had a few years ago, but was never able to fully bring to life. Now that you're here, we can change that. </span></p>
<p>
Oh
I should mention that guy in the corner over there...</p><p>Meet Andrew
Albee, who is responsible for helping with media and financial
management.  He is also going to be helping to keep you and anyone
else who invests in this project abreast of the situation.  Speaking of which here is Andrew to explain why our target number is $108,300 and the math behind the funding requested for this project.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Andrew Albee:  Finances and Director</h3><br/>
<p>Alright, Hi!  I am
Andrew Albee and I handle scheduling, planning and budgeting for
Meep the Space Bat as well as Misunderstood Creature Entertainment LLC (MCE).</p><p><br/></p><p>For
most of the above and below Harry Thompson, our Project Lead has been discussing Meep the Spacebat and why we are
doing an Indiegogo. I am now going to explain why the goal is
$108,300 and why we have phases explaining what we do if
we don’t reach that target shown below.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>First and foremost, $108,300 is our target number for this Indiegogo. This will
get us to a target number of $108,335, which is required to fully
fund our Development Team, get our company set up in a studio and
have the basic equipment we want to finish the game on time. We have
done work on the game up to this point but we can not finish the
project on schedule without help from future backers. Now we are
prepared to finish Meep the Legendary Space Bat even if we do not hit our target for full funding, but first I want to explain how we get
to $108,300.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>For our artists, we
need around $50,338.40 to have them working full time on this
project. For our programmer, we need about $29,996.40 to
have him work full time on this project. This total comes to about $80,334.80. At this point outside of me (Andrew Albee) and our Development Head Harry Thompson, we are fully funded to work on this
project. An additional $28,000.20 allows Harry and I to set up a
studio environment for the Company and get some development programs and equipment which we would like to assist our development
team finishing on schedule. So that is how we get to a goal of $108,300.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the phases mentioned earlier, with the first few being below $108,300. This is because we are
prepared to pay our artists and programmers what we can in order to
get as many hours as we can. Everyone on this team wants to finish
this game. So we are working on doing just that. At $22,000 I can pay
most of the team part time and continue to progress the project for about as
much as they are working on the project right now. At $35,000 we can
work on this project with half time pay. The higher the number goes, the more hours our team can focus on this project without doing a
side job to get by, and the quicker the game can be finished. At $80,334.80 we hit a benchmark where the
development team is able to focus full time on this project. 
</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Every little bit
helps at this point. Our team wants to finish this project, but we
need help from backers and people who want to see this idea be
finished and released. Thus we are doing the Indiegogo so we can make
this a full blown realty.</p>
<p><br/>

</p><p></p><h3>Phases of how the Finances will Work:</h3><br/><p><br/></p><p><b>PHASE 0 - Loading Game</b></p><p>====================================</p><p>$22,000 - We are able to hire on an additional animator and most everyone is being given a part time pay check to devote most of their time on the project. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PHASE 1 - Shattering Meteors</b></p>
<p>
==========================================</p>
<p>$35,000 - All people
involved in the project are essentially being payed half-time rather than full-time.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PHASE 2 - Destroying Swab-Es</b></p>
<p>
==========================================</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 $80,334.80 - While this number is literally the number required to pay everyone full-time to work on this project, it does not give us the studio and equipment we would like to finish this project as fast as we would want. </p>
<p>
Consider
this a bench-marker.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PHASE 3 - S<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">oaring
to the Planet's Surface</span></b></p>
<p>
=========================================</p>
<p>$108,335 - With this number we can get a studio set up and our Dev-Team
is paid full-time.  However, we will not have all the equipment and tools that we would like though we can finish development for Meep at full-time.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PHASE 4 - F<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">ully Powered up Meep</span></b></p>
<p>
===========================================</p>
<p>$137,975.60 - With this number we are able to have a fully functional Studio with everything development wants to finish this project. We will have purchased several new pieces of equipment and programs we don't necessarily need to finish development but they will make the process a lot easier. Everyone can give their full effort to this project, and
not worry about any side jobs or such things in order to pay for rent
etc.   MCE can focus full force
on Meep and we shall make a great game </p>
<p>

as previous, but now we hire an additional programmer to make development go even quicker. </span></p>
<p>*$29,996.40 - Per additional programmer (it should be noted we are only going to be
hiring extra programmers as a consideration should we get past PHASE 4)</p>

showing off throughout development.  While the default web-cams and
mics we have are nice, we would like to give you and everyone helping
us the best quality in everything we're doing.  Thus the upgrades for
everyone on the team.  <br/></p><p>So those are our phases!  I am now going to hand you back To Harry Thompson.</p><p><br/></p><p>Thank you Andrew and here's some more details on some perks we are excited about... </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>More Exciting Details on the Perks </h3><div><br/></div>Our base-line perk to buy the game is 15 bucks.<div><br/></div><div>The expanded perk: Spacebat Savior, is a copy of the game as well as dedicating 5 dollars to Extra Life, helping children who haven't had the chance to chase their dreams as fervently as we are chasing ours for a mere 20 dollars. </div><div><br/></div><div>

<h3>IF We Come Up Short.</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Ok, no one wants to fail, but the fact of the matter is it happens.  However, we have made a commitment to this game and to all of our supporters.  Even if we do not reach our entire goal, we will work with what we have gathered
and then get the rest through investment. </span>
</div><div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">However we want you, the
fans to give us enough through this go-go that we at MCE don’t need
as much as we would without you, and give you a little something extra you wouldn't necessarily have the opportunity for otherwise!  </span>

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">While it might take a couple more
months to complete than if we got funding, we will get this game done. If
there's one thing we at MCE don’t like, its not finishing a good

that before and MCE is committed to not being those people.  </span><br/>

<h3>Why We feel We Need Meep</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	We
	need more than Toho and a handful of Space Invader clones.  Meep
	is the start of a series of games I want to make happen. I'm not
	trying to make a game for the sake of making a game, I’m building a
	franchise and Meep is a fun game concept to do it with. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Meep's
	journey is for great cupcakes. Gradius , Raiden and R-type were
	revolutionary games of their time.  I want to see more of this
	game type and I want to see it given a treatment similar to that of
	what companies like Way-forward has done with old games.</p></li>
<li><p>For
	me I wanted to make the game about a creature instead of a ship or a
	girl.  I wanted to do a more traditional story, with some irony and
	parody and for that, MCE provides.</p></li>
<li><p>Now is the time to create a
	fun game that has more depth than the infinite runners we currently
	have.  I want to introduce newer mechanics such as team moves, etc into the enemy AI and to give a challenge for the player which forces them to adapt to enemy patterns lending a more strategic element than 5,000 bullets on the screen.</p></li>
<li>
<p><i>Of course there is also YOU:</i></p>
</li>
<li><p>Meep
	has successfully tested with multiple live audiences children and
	adults alike</p></li>
<li>
<p>
	In
	over 20,000 separate demo tests we never got a bad review</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>And for US as well:</i></p></li>
<li>
<p>
	MCE
	is committed to making great games happen because we as Gamers want
	to see more of these.  Together we want to make that happen for not
	just us but for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While this is our first project, everyone involved is skilled with their craft and dedicated to making this work.</p></li>

<h3>Common Questions about Challenges to Us and Risks on Your End. </h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I
shall be listing some risks and challenges in bullet point form then
I'm going to show you why you can trust in us and not worry. </p>
<p> - MCE
is a young company</p>
<p> - MCE
has no previous IP's it has worked on.</p>
<p> - $125,000
dollars is a lot of money <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>                 </p>
<h3>Our Responses to these concerns</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li><p>MCE might be a young company, but the people in MCE and the Meep team in general all have varying degrees of work experience.  They know what it takes to get things done.  While none of the Meep team's Programmers or Artists have previous IP all of us have worked on projects before.<br/></p></li>
<li>
<p>You
	can't solve Youth, that happens over time </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MCE
	currently has nothing but devoted workers that want nothing more
	than to do this game and give it the attention it deserves. While this is our first IP as a team, Conrad and everyone else on the team has been
	involved in successful small projects on their own or in smaller groups. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore, with the year of work
	previous to this, our skills can create a great IP in Meep and I can
	tell you personally, everyone on this team wants to do more projects
	after this one.  We have no desire to just make one great thing and
	then go away, we want to make multiple things and are hoping you will
	stay. </p></li>

       Hi! Andrew Here. I am posting this video showing game play footage of one of our early alpha builds so you can see the rough direction we are wanting to go. This is an early alpha build in fact we have replaced all the art work with new stuff. I hope to showcase some of the art work next week. Also please check our Gallery in the Indiegogo for more videos that we have made.
 -Path of Meep: Added 3/24/2016-


The Path of Meep is one
of two years struggling to make it to this point. We are not merely
wandering around in circles with no design or idea for what we want
to do with this game.
Meep the Legendary Spacebat is a return to the 2 dimensional ""Space Shooter"".  If you were not around in the mid 90s, a ""Space Shooter"" is
a game in which you play a ship or robot of some sort and fly
around. You try to dodge things that can kill you in one or two shots, gaining power-ups by blowing the bad guys out of the sky. Traditional ""Space Shooters"" usually have enemies that follow a pattern and don't
react to the player. Even
before enemies are
programmed into the game, we plan them out so that way we can make the game have a good replay
value. We do this by
figuring out what
the most common pattern would be then trying to mess with it.

We have actually engineered locations where a boss or mob could be
put in. Indeed all of the power ups I created were specifically
designed to showcase what we could do. The thing is, when you have 5
to 6 minutes to showcase a game and talk about all the things in it
you can't really hit all that. Being concise has the price of skipping
over a lot of details. In the video I say, “I love the art of it
all.” That is 100% true, but what I don't go into that much is why.
When I was a younger man I was one of those guys who played around
in Arcades a lot in the 80's. What always bothered me is on the
side of the arcade box the art is around 10 times better than in the actual game. As the games got better people started experimenting with
polygon counts and such and the arcade faded. In my initial attempt
to do this game we had a demo.  You will notice that demo being played
in the video.
As you read this, Margo is currently finishing up or has finished
up if you're reading this after the 28th of next week-Full upgrades
to everything you saw in the video. All the artwork you saw in the video
after the game play point illustrates the changes. See, when we last
showcased this game we had something that was of quality that quite
frankly we probably could have made a small app out of.
I don't want to make a cash grab out of this.  My objective is to
use the fact that we can actually have hand drawn animations in video
games to its fullest. Reactionary and pattern based AI Enemies instead of something that just follows a pattern or something that
just reacts, why not both?  That sort of AI exists in modern action
games, beat-em-ups and FPS games but not in ""Space Shooters"".  If these exist in ""Space Shooters"", they are well hidden, or reserved for bosses.
I want to introduce elements such as evolving weapons, and using points
like how some M.O.B.A.s use gold or coins.  The idea being when you go through the
game you can have multiple different play styles. Meep can hold up to
4 weapons at a given time and store weapons in Echo's Shop. One of the
first additional weapons we came up with, was the knife launcher which
turns the basic attack from a rapid fire fireball into a rapid fire
knife launcher that while it does less damage then the basic Meep
shot, it goes through enemies using the same pattern. Meaning
unlike the Meep shot, it can deal with crowds faster.
Plus, you are now a bat, in space, with a knife, that is on fire with
blue flames. Meep's game play is going to have two types-infinite enemy and boss rushes like Meeppocolapse.  Then there
is the main game play which is more like the traditional 2D dog
fights and follows the story though around 8 levels, including but not
exclusive to: Castle Raids, Ship Battles, Forest on fire, Duels with
Magic wielding heroes that mistake you for an intruder, Epic fights
involving Meep vs an automatic Vacuum Cleaner that has a laser
gatling gun security protocol. Falling down into the core of a planet
and much more!
When I wrote the game, I specifically left the environments open in
certain areas so people could fill those open spaces in with unique
OCs fighting in epic duels to keep back the army (or maybe being part
of the army) as Meep pushes forward through the chaos.
When it comes down to it, this game is about giving a fully
animated, artistic, and fun game to the library of games.  Giving
another option to people who like the ""Space Shooter"" genre. I want to
push some of the new ideas and philosophies in gaming, and use those
to improve on the ""Space Shooter"" model. I like Toho, I like games like
Ikuruga, that’s fine... but I really wish there was a ""Space Shooter"" that had a Castlevania style old school pacing and as I am currently
not aware of one, my objective is to bring it into existence. Games
like Castlevania and Super Ghouls and Ghosts were tough as nails not
because of so much on the screen.
Alexander our programmer has never had a chance to practice his craft, so I am giving
him a place to start growing his portfolio and he is happy to help us
out. As I type this, Alexander is working hard on formulas, code
and implementation.  So between him and the other artists on the
team, I am happy and look forward to seeing a lot of cool designs come
to life.  The stage progression is wonderful and I look forward to
watching it grow. It is often said but I mean this, sincerely, I hope
you look forward to this as much as I do.  Together for great cupcakes
and so I can entertain, and create a great game for all of you to
play! Lets walk the Path of Meep Together!We are Misunderstood Creature Entertainment (MCE)What is that?
Misunderstood
Creature Entertainment or M.C.E is a young gaming company. We wanted
to do this project 1 year ago, but when we looked at our product at the time, we realized we could do better after further development.  Now, 1 year later, we have
acquired a stable team ready to design a great game for you. We hope
to succeed so we can design even more games in the future.Our Hopes


	We
	are hoping to not just build a good game, but something great. I
	would say epic but to me that word is used so much it has lost its
	punch. As Gamers ourselves some of us have noticed a sad fact:  Unless you are a fan of bullet hell games Space shooters are
	practically dead. 

Why is this?  Well it's because this genre really hasn't seen much advancement compared to all the other genres of gaming so prevalent in today's design world. While it is great to have good consistent designs, what if I want something different?  That's where MCE
	came up with the idea to take the initiative, and instead of waiting
	for that next great game to come-actually go out and make it.  
We as a team have worked day in and day out towards this dream.  Now, we need your
	help not only because it is important to us to be able to work on this, but because we want to get this game developed and out there for
	everyone to enjoy as soon as possible. 
Our Success and What it Means


	By
	this Indiegogo succeeding we will be able to successfully fund the
	necessary people to work full time on this project and give it their full attention without having to concern themselves with part time
	work. In short by this being successfully funded you are allowing
	the artists, programmers and workers the ability to do their craft
	and produce for you a great product: A space shooter that  has
	full hand drawn animation, as well as enemy AI patterns and team attacks which make the player pay attention to more than the bullet
	locations on the screen. Having to fire and engage in 2D dog-fights
	in the sky with a variety of enemies: melee, ranged, even enemies that will try to trap the Player. This mixes with varied and multiple play
	styles with a variety of weapons to provide a challenging 2D Space Shooter Experience.  



	Back
	when we demoed the proof of concept, I would sometimes notice people
	try to camp in one location on the left hand side of the screen.  They
	would die very shortly after.  However when they actually moved around
	and engaged the game they did very good.  This means a lot to me because that's the sort of feeling I want out of a space shooter.  I want to
	fire my attacks off and take out many enemies yes, but I also want to
	have to problem solve against enemy AI. I feel that while the space
	shooter genre has produced a lot of fun games, most of the enemy challenge comes from the sheer quantity of bullets and effects they produce in any given level, rather than a tactical challenge. While this is a game-play
	style I like a lot, I don't feel it's the only thing the genre can do.  So in Meep our goal is to present adversaries with unique advantages and disadvantages to the
	enemy AI patterns used. In addition we seek to support a protocol for encountering  other enemies at certain positions on the field and unleashing team up moves
	to change up the pace once in a while on the player. 



	Everyone
	on this team wants to do this full time and give it their all but we
	need financial support to make that happen and that's where you come
	in.  





What YOU get for helping US, and what we are going to do with your cash 
As
previously stated, this Indiegogo is all about you helping me hire
full time the team that has been toiling away at this part
time for a year, getting them the ability to finally focus full
time on this project and be paid a professional rate to do so. Thus
allowing them to give their full attention to this project free of
distraction.  Ironically, I'd like to kinda think of this as you
helping me hire them. So let me thank you ahead of time, as you virtually sit
next to me at this table helping me out.  Who are we hiring? Let me showcase to you the team
you are going to help turn into full time developers... Meet The Team Shawn Meadows: Background and Effects
Shawn
 Meadows  is our background artist.  He has trained his entire life
dedicating himself to making great and dynamic looking art
backgrounds. He has worked on small commission projects which he successfully finished with our animator Margo Hopper. Thus they know how to compliment each others' style perfectly.  Anyone
whose anyone knows how important and impressive it is to have a
background artist who can compliment the art of your entities and
things in front of them. It's sometimes distracting for a person to be
playing a game where the art in the front is a clearly pixelated
chibi sprite, but the background looks like a  work from Leonardo Da
Vinci. I wanted the styles to match, so when I heard from miss Hopper
that she knew someone who could  fill in, I tested them out
with a new space background.  What I got back was dynamic.  It wasn't just the
little white stars no, this was some multi-color, dynamic space
background with some images already prepared to enable our programmer to do some
depth tricks and I was floored. Naturally of course, I then decided to
hire him on.Margo Hopper: Animator 
Margo’s
style is exceptional and blossoming.  While working with us, she has increased from
12 frames of animation, to being able to go up to 60 frames of animation.  Margo
has a really nice, dynamic cartoon style that fits perfectly in front
of the style that Sean uses.  

Margo
is an experienced artist, however this is her first big animation
project. Most of her animations are 7-12 min shorts on commission work.
  As such, for the past year I've seen her grow and both of us
can't wait to have you exposed to the improvements in her style and
technique.   Like with Sean, Margo is an artist committed to this
project's success as is everyone on this team.  Kris ""The Alexander"" Myers:  Programming

Next, there is Kris ""the Alexander"" Myers, our current
main programmer. He is well versed in HTML and JavaScript. He also
thinks sideways.  Don't understand what I mean? Allow me to explain - he's the type of guy who
when he tests a game's code, goes out of his way to break it so he can
then rebuild it better. In short, exactly what you'd want in a programmer. A college graduate and dedicated to make this
project work, he has all the tools necessary to program a Game for PC
or Mac. He is currently a father right now so he's got one of his
dreams, but another dream of his was to be a game programmer. Well folks, I
say let's give it to him and watch him soar! Alexander wants to work
more on this then he is currently, but again we need YOU to do that.Conrad: A Man of Many Voices
Then
there is Conrad who does really great voice work. Conrad is on the
level of Chuck Avery but he's not as known. He can do over 100 tones, accents and voice types!  No I'm not exaggerating.  He is really
good at bringing characters to life.  In fact when we demoed the
game, you would be shocked to know how many people were
surprised or told me ""No way!"" when I told them that every voice in the
game, every noise, is the same person.      Harry Thompson IV: Project Lead and Designer 
Myself, I'm Harry Thompson.  I designed Meep the Spacebat for MCE.  The enemy
patterns and the storyboard ideas are pretty much based on the
designs I had a few years ago, but was never able to fully bring to life. Now that you're here, we can change that. 

Oh
I should mention that guy in the corner over there...Meet Andrew
Albee, who is responsible for helping with media and financial
management.  He is also going to be helping to keep you and anyone
else who invests in this project abreast of the situation.  Speaking of which here is Andrew to explain why our target number is $108,300 and the math behind the funding requested for this project.Andrew Albee:  Finances and Director
Alright, Hi!  I am
Andrew Albee and I handle scheduling, planning and budgeting for
Meep the Space Bat as well as Misunderstood Creature Entertainment LLC (MCE).For
most of the above and below Harry Thompson, our Project Lead has been discussing Meep the Spacebat and why we are
doing an Indiegogo. I am now going to explain why the goal is
$108,300 and why we have phases explaining what we do if
we don’t reach that target shown below.

First and foremost, $108,300 is our target number for this Indiegogo. This will
get us to a target number of $108,335, which is required to fully
fund our Development Team, get our company set up in a studio and
have the basic equipment we want to finish the game on time. We have
done work on the game up to this point but we can not finish the
project on schedule without help from future backers. Now we are
prepared to finish Meep the Legendary Space Bat even if we do not hit our target for full funding, but first I want to explain how we get
to $108,300.

For our artists, we
need around $50,338.40 to have them working full time on this
project. For our programmer, we need about $29,996.40 to
have him work full time on this project. This total comes to about $80,334.80. At this point outside of me (Andrew Albee) and our Development Head Harry Thompson, we are fully funded to work on this
project. An additional $28,000.20 allows Harry and I to set up a
studio environment for the Company and get some development programs and equipment which we would like to assist our development
team finishing on schedule. So that is how we get to a goal of $108,300.

Below are the phases mentioned earlier, with the first few being below $108,300. This is because we are
prepared to pay our artists and programmers what we can in order to
get as many hours as we can. Everyone on this team wants to finish
this game. So we are working on doing just that. At $22,000 I can pay
most of the team part time and continue to progress the project for about as
much as they are working on the project right now. At $35,000 we can
work on this project with half time pay. The higher the number goes, the more hours our team can focus on this project without doing a
side job to get by, and the quicker the game can be finished. At $80,334.80 we hit a benchmark where the
development team is able to focus full time on this project. 


Every little bit
helps at this point. Our team wants to finish this project, but we
need help from backers and people who want to see this idea be
finished and released. Thus we are doing the Indiegogo so we can make
this a full blown realty.


Phases of how the Finances will Work:PHASE 0 - Loading Game====================================$22,000 - We are able to hire on an additional animator and most everyone is being given a part time pay check to devote most of their time on the project. 
PHASE 1 - Shattering Meteors

==========================================
$35,000 - All people
involved in the project are essentially being payed half-time rather than full-time.
PHASE 2 - Destroying Swab-Es

==========================================



 $80,334.80 - While this number is literally the number required to pay everyone full-time to work on this project, it does not give us the studio and equipment we would like to finish this project as fast as we would want. 

Consider
this a bench-marker.
PHASE 3 - Soaring
to the Planet's Surface

=========================================
$108,335 - With this number we can get a studio set up and our Dev-Team
is paid full-time.  However, we will not have all the equipment and tools that we would like though we can finish development for Meep at full-time.
PHASE 4 - Fully Powered up Meep

===========================================
$137,975.60 - With this number we are able to have a fully functional Studio with everything development wants to finish this project. We will have purchased several new pieces of equipment and programs we don't necessarily need to finish development but they will make the process a lot easier. Everyone can give their full effort to this project, and
not worry about any side jobs or such things in order to pay for rent
etc.   MCE can focus full force
on Meep and we shall make a great game 

 
              
                   
       
PHASE 5 - Bonus Option                
     

 ===========================================
  $167,972.
.00 - Same
as previous, but now we hire an additional programmer to make development go even quicker. 
*$29,996.40 - Per additional programmer (it should be noted we are only going to be
hiring extra programmers as a consideration should we get past PHASE 4)

PHASE 6 - Advanced Video Feed ===========================================
$197,968.40 - At
this point MCE will have its own mini studio 

2
programmers, 2 artists,  2 developers, 2 voice actors and an extra $4,285.20/month dedicated to upgrading all our tech which we will be
showing off throughout development.  While the default web-cams and
mics we have are nice, we would like to give you and everyone helping
us the best quality in everything we're doing.  Thus the upgrades for
everyone on the team.  So those are our phases!  I am now going to hand you back To Harry Thompson.Thank you Andrew and here's some more details on some perks we are excited about... More Exciting Details on the Perks Our base-line perk to buy the game is 15 bucks.The expanded perk: Spacebat Savior, is a copy of the game as well as dedicating 5 dollars to Extra Life, helping children who haven't had the chance to chase their dreams as fervently as we are chasing ours for a mere 20 dollars. 
People
	who give at $100.00 will get to be in the game as a background
	character!  Our backgrounds currently have some empty spaces for
	animations, we're hoping some of you will help us fill up the villages, carts and audiences to battle sequences etc. We call
	this ""Digital Immortality."" It becomes unavailable when we have
	filled all the empty spaces in the game.  I expect to have room
	for around 120 different people.
At $220.00 dollars we are offering a collectors art book with a leather bound design which looks as close as we could get to the storybook in game. In it printed on its pages are the images of all the artwork in the game.  So you can show it off to your friends, get ideas for some cool fan art, or put it in a pile of other epic art books you happen to own.  
Another
level of funding at $250.00 helps you work with us at MCE to create a
boss for the Random Boss Roulette Arena!  There are going to be 5
bosses, 1 of them we are already working on! We won't tell you until
this reward tier fills up, but when it does we will reveal the
bosses we will want to work on with you. You also get three digital soundtracks and games.

For people who want all the accessories, you can get ""Echo's Deal"" for $450.00 
Designing a power up at $600.00! 
Even assist in level design for $1,500.00! 
As you can see, there are numerous exciting ways to get involved, and get swag! 


IF We Come Up Short.

Ok, no one wants to fail, but the fact of the matter is it happens.  However, we have made a commitment to this game and to all of our supporters.  Even if we do not reach our entire goal, we will work with what we have gathered
and then get the rest through investment. 

However we want you, the
fans to give us enough through this go-go that we at MCE don’t need
as much as we would without you, and give you a little something extra you wouldn't necessarily have the opportunity for otherwise!  

While it might take a couple more
months to complete than if we got funding, we will get this game done. If
there's one thing we at MCE don’t like, its not finishing a good
project.  As a Gamer, I know people who have gotten burned like
that before and MCE is committed to not being those people.  
   

Why We feel We Need Meep




	We
	need more than Toho and a handful of Space Invader clones.  Meep
	is the start of a series of games I want to make happen. I'm not
	trying to make a game for the sake of making a game, I’m building a
	franchise and Meep is a fun game concept to do it with. 

Meep's
	journey is for great cupcakes. Gradius , Raiden and R-type were
	revolutionary games of their time.  I want to see more of this
	game type and I want to see it given a treatment similar to that of
	what companies like Way-forward has done with old games.
For
	me I wanted to make the game about a creature instead of a ship or a
	girl.  I wanted to do a more traditional story, with some irony and
	parody and for that, MCE provides.
Now is the time to create a
	fun game that has more depth than the infinite runners we currently
	have.  I want to introduce newer mechanics such as team moves, etc into the enemy AI and to give a challenge for the player which forces them to adapt to enemy patterns lending a more strategic element than 5,000 bullets on the screen.

Of course there is also YOU:

Meep
	has successfully tested with multiple live audiences children and
	adults alike


	In
	over 20,000 separate demo tests we never got a bad review

And for US as well:


	MCE
	is committed to making great games happen because we as Gamers want
	to see more of these.  Together we want to make that happen for not
	just us but for you.

While this is our first project, everyone involved is skilled with their craft and dedicated to making this work.


Common Questions about Challenges to Us and Risks on Your End. 

I
shall be listing some risks and challenges in bullet point form then
I'm going to show you why you can trust in us and not worry. 
 - MCE
is a young company
 - MCE
has no previous IP's it has worked on.
 - $125,000
dollars is a lot of money  
                 
Our Responses to these concerns


MCE might be a young company, but the people in MCE and the Meep team in general all have varying degrees of work experience.  They know what it takes to get things done.  While none of the Meep team's Programmers or Artists have previous IP all of us have worked on projects before.

You
	can't solve Youth, that happens over time 


MCE
	currently has nothing but devoted workers that want nothing more
	than to do this game and give it the attention it deserves. While this is our first IP as a team, Conrad and everyone else on the team has been
	involved in successful small projects on their own or in smaller groups. 

Furthermore, with the year of work
	previous to this, our skills can create a great IP in Meep and I can
	tell you personally, everyone on this team wants to do more projects
	after this one.  We have no desire to just make one great thing and
	then go away, we want to make multiple things and are hoping you will
	stay. 



Other
Ways You Can Help


I’m
serious when I say I want to build a community.  Start talking to your
friends and generating awareness.  If you wish to do some video feed
of Meep and be involved with showcasing it you can email us at
meepthespacebatisnifty@gmail.com 

This will allow us to talk to you and share some footage with you with only some minor stipulations. Please share this with as many people
as you can and  get as many people to give as much financial
support as you can.  
The more we generate, the stronger a game we
can build.  

Our finances are based off of making a game within 7 months to a little over a year


And
that's all there is to it.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

Last year, the entire 2016 class at Gameheads applied for and won 4 out of the 20 ESA LOFT Video Game Innovation Fellowships that was offered nationwide. Following in the foot steps Team LUCID who won the 2014 ESA LOFT Video Game Innovation Fellowship with their game on overcoming grief; after winning, they earned their way to E3 2015 thanks to their many contributors. A look into their journey.
UPbeat Oakland Games | Project - LUCiD​
 

The fellowship identifies and promotes innovators who can create video games or mobile apps that will focus on new approaches to address local and global social issues. Each team received a $1000 grant to continue development on their games, national recognition, and tickets for the entire team to this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3); the world's premier event for computer, video and mobile games and related products.
Now, as we follow in the footsteps of our predecessors and take the trip to E3 as well. We need your help! There are a lot more people who are going this year; a total of 12 people, five of which are under 18 and require chaperones to attend as well. 
Now we need your help to get us there. 
We already have the tickets accounted for but we still need $8500 to pay for all of us to attend the event.
This money pays for the:

Car rental
Gas
Hotel expenses
 Food
Each team has worked hard over the past year, hoping to make their game come to fruition. Three of these teams are scheduled for completion within the next couple months. So, If you are interested in supporting us, we encourage you to take a look at each team below and follow, like, retweet and/or share our campaign on social media.Meet The Gameheads
Team Halls High | Project - Halls High
| 

Halls High is about a boy named Jeremiah who is failing his classes and is far too lazy to care. One day he meets a mysterious tutor who introduces him to a magical “solution” that begins a wild adventure. Inspired by Persona and Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Halls High is a coming of age story about a black teenager who must learn the importance of dealing with both fear and success. Team Phantom | Project - Dual Meanings
 

Dual Meanings follows the story of two art students, Seth and Rose, who have been tasked with an assignment to create a work of beauty. Seth uses the opportunity to paint a picture of Rose, but she has differing opinions on beauty. With their convictions at odds, Seth must traverse through obstacles representing their differences with Rose in order to reach a compromise.

<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<p>I am Danni (or Roadbloc) and I am currently developing The Mystery of Robot Planet! I love being creative in my spare time and after finishing my latest book I decided to focus my efforts on a video game. As a long time gamer and fan of many games, I have always made time to be developing silly little personal projects. This, however, is my first effort at something decent, something sellable and hopefully something awesome.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Normally, I would have completed this project in my own time like I did with my books. However, regretfully, I have recently found myself unemployed. This means I cannot continue dedicating time to this project until I find a replacement job ...or I am able to drum up some funds and keep my rent paid.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm asking for £2000. If I reach this goal, it shall pay my rent for a while and I can continue development throughout my job search.</li>
<li>Anything helps. Even if I don't reach the goal any contributions will equate to development time.</li>
<li>All contributors who give £2 or more will receive a DRM-free copy of the game upon release for Windows, Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>All funds will go on paying rent. I have zero development costs other than my time.</li>
<li>Also, if I reach the full amount, I will put time and effort into researching how to make an Android port of the game. And then I'll port it. :)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>The Mystery of Robot Planet is an 8bit-inspired adventure puzzle game. Graphically akin to early GameBoy Pokemon and Zelda titles. Gameplay similar to games like Monkey Island and Beneath a Steel Sky. Here is a list of the features my engine has to offer (so far)-</p>
<ul>
<li>Colourful top-down view of the game's world. In 8(ish) bits!</li>
<li>Inspect any world object (for clues, plot exposition or inventory items).</li>
<li>Speak to any NPC (again, for clues, plot exposition or inventory items).</li>
<li>Inventory system for looking at inventory items, combining inventory items together, giving items to NPCs or using inventory items on world objects.</li>
<li>Use in-game ""terminals"" (PCs) for clues, plot exposition, inventory items or puzzle mechanics.</li>
<li>""Cutscene"" engine to power automatic movement of player character or movement of NPCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a taste, take a look at the walkthrough video. <a href=""https://roadbloc.itch.io/the-mystery-of-robot-planet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Or even better, visit my Itch.io page to download the beta for yourself!</a></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!  We're looking to turn our passion into a business.  Rhiannon has been playing video games since around 1990 (including rare systems like the Atari Jaguar and TurboGrafix) and got into D&amp;D and Magic around 1998.  Still a gamer even with 2 kids (up and coming gamers themselves!) but with more focus on video games than tabletop nowadays.  Robert has about the same amount of experience with video games, moreso in different genres, and more experience in CCGs and the like.  </p>
<p>Many of the local shops we have found are small, dark, not much room for gaming.  And nothing really in the general area to play console or PC games unless you want to take a drive to get there.  We want to make a brighter, more welcoming shop with plenty of room for everyone, regardless of the type of gaming.</p>
<p>The reason for this campaign is we want to gauge if others are as interested in a shop like this in the Waterbury/Southington area.  By showing your support you become a part of the shop, you can say YOU HELPED MAKE IT HAPPEN!  And by showing your support we know we are not alone in wanting a full-service shop like this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise $70,000 to start this venture up, with stretch goals should we make it.  Starting supplies for each area aren't too much, but when you put everything together it adds up fast.  The biggest amounts being the games, PCs and Consoles.  </p>
<p>We're offering LIMITED EDITION t-shirts, hoodies, wristbands, and gaming time as rewards.  Also, every contributor of $5 or more will have their name on our ""Credits"" wall in the shop, a permanent reminder of your contribution.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we can at least take what we do raise to the bank for a loan for the rest.  We'd rather not pay the interest if we don't have to though!</p>
<p>If we DO reach our goal, we have a few stretch goals in mind.  One being a Dance Revolution arcade setup. Another being retro and hard-to-find systems available to play.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having been in the gaming world long enough, we've been in our share of different shops.  We've seen ones that boggle our mind as to how they are still open.  We've seen LAN centers come and go, at least twice, in Waterbury alone.  We feel that offering everything would be a boon to the area.  </p>
<p>Our son is 7 and loves Pokemon.  He's advanced in his reading, in part, due to reading comics and video game dialogue.  When we mentioned the idea to him, his eyes lit up!  He wants to set up a kid's gaming area in the shop.  Many of our friends have the same interests and hobbies.  It's difficult at times to navigate through a small shop when you have kids in tow, we know this from experience.  A kid's room gives them a safe place to play while the parents play.  </p>
<p>Also, with a female co-owner/employee, we're hoping to show that it's ok for girls to be geeks!  Embrace your inner (and outer) geek-ness with us!  Whether you're a PC or Console gamer, Marvel or DC fan, Dr Who or Dr Robotnik, we'll have something for you here!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a chance we don't raise enough to cover everything.  If we can at least raise enough to start small, that would work.  There is enough call for this type of shop for our area that I don't think we'll have too much trouble building up to the full store if we don't raise enough.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money is tight all around.  We won't take it personally if you can't do the $10 ""Thank you"".  You reading this, and clicking the link is more help than you can imagine.  So spread the word!  Share the link on social media, tell your friends, and when we open, be sure to stop in and say HI!!</p>

<span>The idea of this game came at Minsk Global Game Jam Contest in 2015. Right at that moment the country was suffering an economic crisis, banks were overcrowded with people trying to buy foreign currency. So I decided to create a game about a common citizen caught in the middle of economic collapse. The guy is running from one bank to another while shooting his hostile competitors.</span><p></p> </div>

<div><span><span>In a few hours I managed to gather a team of rag-tag developers and we started to work. There was only 1 artist in our team, so we decided to use very simple graphical style that looks like a pen drawing in a schoolboy note.</span><br/></span></div>
<div><span><span><p><span>This visual style of the game turn out to be a cornerstone of our game which shaped the rest of the concept. It was later enhanced by sound effects made by mouth. These two features provided unique look and feel of the game and helped it to stand out from the crowd.</span></p>

<div><span><span><b><br/></b>The game was made in just two days and turned out to be a big success! People found it a hilarious experience. After receiving ‘best game’ award we decided to continue our work and turn a half-baked prototype into a full fledged game.<br/></span></span></div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">This task proved to be much more difficult than we originally expected.

Months of intense work were passing by, but we didn’t give up!</span>

<div>
<p><span>We don’t want just to throw in some extra content.</span></p>
<p>Our goal is to add new elements for each aspect of gameplay, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New core mechanic - rage,</p></li>
<li><p>New gamplay mode - flying in a jet</p></li>
<li><p>New types of enemies with different behavior,</p></li>
<li><p>Cool guns which shoot bouncing bullets or portals to another dimension,</p></li>
<li><p>Epic final boss battle,</p></li>
<li><p>New locations, stages, talents, music tracks and other great stuff!</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>Here is the description of features we have in mind.</p>
<h2>Rage mechanic</h2>
<p>‘Rage’ is an activated ability of a hero which dramatically increases his speed and rate of fire allowing to quickly clear out a horde of enemies. Rage will be extremely useful in tight situations and during boss fights. Also while enraged the character will shout 'A-A-A!!!' while pulling the trigger. This mechanic was inspired by a short parody video ‘Rambo 94 - Last blood’.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FLuecH9Xct88%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLuecH9Xct88&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLuecH9Xct88%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>New gameplay mode - flying in a jet</h2>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Before you could walk around a town or drive a car. After you'll be able to </span>fly in a combat jet<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> shooting down those pesky UFO's. We don't want another alien invasion, do we?</span>
</div>
<h2>New weapons</h2>
<p><b>Bouncing Shooter</b> - this gun shoots a burst of three bullets which bounce from the enemies hurting them with each hit.</p>
<p><b>Bolt Cannon</b> - once a construction tool, now a weapon which shoots steel bolts in ten direction at once!</p>
<p><b>Warp Gun</b> - this alien weapon creates a gate to another dimension which sucks the enemies in and then spits them out.</p>
<h2>New enemies</h2>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465152603/mode_hardcore_i75q1k.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p><b>Jet Rider</b> - This guy is desperate to get you! He flies like a fly (heh-heh) right above your head and throws grenades right in front of you.</p>
<p><b>UFO</b> - It appears this thing came from outer space to take part in the riot! It positions itself in front of a moving player’s car and attack it with laser beams.</p>
<p><b>Mad Marksman</b> - unlike other Mad Rioters this guy is taking his time and distance waiting for an opening to deliver a deadly shot.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">Epic final boss battle</span><br/></p>
<p>Every game needs a grand finale! For such a crazy game the final battle must take place on another planet. So it will be an entirely new location with hordes of angry aliens trying to piss you off.</p>
<h2>Mid bosses</h2>
<p>Mid Bosses are tough opponents that spawns from time to time in a crowd of regular enemies. While Mid Boss poses a higher threat, killing it rewards you with med kit and extra experience points. The decision to fight him or to run away is up to you.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">Additional content</span><br/></p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>New hero’s talents </b>- Righteous Rage (increases Rage duration) and Sharp Shooter (increases weapon range).</p></li>
<li><p><b>New locations</b> - In case we gather enough funds we will add new locations such as supermarket or fast food restaurant. Town map also will be expanded.</p></li>
<li><p><b>New stages</b> - With this new content we can add 11 new stages or even more!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Extended soundtrack</b> - With luck we’ll compose additional music tracks for the game and release it as a DLC.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hero’s avatars</b> - you’ll be able to choose hero’s look from several avatars.</p></li>
<li><p><b>More colorful graphics and new special effects</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Steam Achievments</b></p></li>

</div></div>","'State of Anarchy' is a casual top-down shooter about a common citizen caught in the middle of a riot in a small town. Pen drawn graphics and moth made sound effects create a unique hilarious atmosphere of mayhem and craziness.The idea of this game was brainstormed on Minsk Global Game Jam Contest. For almost a year we were working hard to turn this award-winning prototype into a full-fledged game. Finally, we've released it on Steam.After receiving tons of positive feedback we want to expand the game by adding new gameplay mechanics, weapons, enemies, game stages and other cool stuff! This content will be available as a DLC 'Rage of the Angry Citizen'. And we need your help to make it possible!
Note: DLC content will be available for free for every State of Anarchy owner on Steam.









 
The idea of this game came at Minsk Global Game Jam Contest in 2015. Right at that moment the country was suffering an economic crisis, banks were overcrowded with people trying to buy foreign currency. So I decided to create a game about a common citizen caught in the middle of economic collapse. The guy is running from one bank to another while shooting his hostile competitors. 

In a few hours I managed to gather a team of rag-tag developers and we started to work. There was only 1 artist in our team, so we decided to use very simple graphical style that looks like a pen drawing in a schoolboy note.
This visual style of the game turn out to be a cornerstone of our game which shaped the rest of the concept. It was later enhanced by sound effects made by mouth. These two features provided unique look and feel of the game and helped it to stand out from the crowd.




Game Jam ‘State of Anarchy’ team
The game was made in just two days and turned out to be a big success! People found it a hilarious experience. After receiving ‘best game’ award we decided to continue our work and turn a half-baked prototype into a full fledged game.

This task proved to be much more difficult than we originally expected. The original conception was to create crazy open world arcade shooter with frantic gameplay. While the overall concept of the game seemed to be ok, we had tons of problems while trying to combine different mechanics and create a coherent playing experience. Months of intense work were passing by, but we didn’t give up!


At last, ‘State of Anarchy’ game was born! It was successfully Greenlit and is available on Steam.

State of Anarchy on Steam





Game soundtrack was created by a talented street musician Chatski. I still can't believe he did such amazing job for free!

The game received a very warm welcome from Steam community:





But we also received some criticism:




Overall the main complaint was that the game is too short and shallow. In order to respond to this we want to create an expansion pack with new mechanics and content which will enhance playing experience and moves our game to a new level!
We need your help to achieve this!
Our team has been working on the game for almost a year on pure enthusiasm. So it will take months until the game generate enough profit to cover our costs. By releasing the game we’ve proved it’s worth. We’ve received good very positive feedback and we know it’s fun to play. We want to make a next step right now and we need relatively small amount of money for this. Most importantly - we need to know that there are enough people out there, who likes our game and want to see it in a new shape.
If you think that ‘State of Anarchy’ deserves to be developed into a solid game - let’s do it together!
Note: DLC content will be available for free for every State of Anarchy owner on Steam.










We don’t want just to throw in some extra content.
Our goal is to add new elements for each aspect of gameplay, such as:

New core mechanic - rage,
New gamplay mode - flying in a jet
New types of enemies with different behavior,
Cool guns which shoot bouncing bullets or portals to another dimension,
Epic final boss battle,
New locations, stages, talents, music tracks and other great stuff!

Here is the description of features we have in mind.
Rage mechanic
‘Rage’ is an activated ability of a hero which dramatically increases his speed and rate of fire allowing to quickly clear out a horde of enemies. Rage will be extremely useful in tight situations and during boss fights. Also while enraged the character will shout 'A-A-A!!!' while pulling the trigger. This mechanic was inspired by a short parody video ‘Rambo 94 - Last blood’.

New gameplay mode - flying in a jet

Before you could walk around a town or drive a car. After you'll be able to fly in a combat jet shooting down those pesky UFO's. We don't want another alien invasion, do we?

New weapons
Bouncing Shooter - this gun shoots a burst of three bullets which bounce from the enemies hurting them with each hit.
Bolt Cannon - once a construction tool, now a weapon which shoots steel bolts in ten direction at once!
Warp Gun - this alien weapon creates a gate to another dimension which sucks the enemies in and then spits them out.
New enemies

Jet Rider - This guy is desperate to get you! He flies like a fly (heh-heh) right above your head and throws grenades right in front of you.
UFO - It appears this thing came from outer space to take part in the riot! It positions itself in front of a moving player’s car and attack it with laser beams.
Mad Marksman - unlike other Mad Rioters this guy is taking his time and distance waiting for an opening to deliver a deadly shot.
Epic final boss battle
Every game needs a grand finale! For such a crazy game the final battle must take place on another planet. So it will be an entirely new location with hordes of angry aliens trying to piss you off.
Mid bosses
Mid Bosses are tough opponents that spawns from time to time in a crowd of regular enemies. While Mid Boss poses a higher threat, killing it rewards you with med kit and extra experience points. The decision to fight him or to run away is up to you.
Additional content

New hero’s talents - Righteous Rage (increases Rage duration) and Sharp Shooter (increases weapon range).
New locations - In case we gather enough funds we will add new locations such as supermarket or fast food restaurant. Town map also will be expanded.
New stages - With this new content we can add 11 new stages or even more!
Extended soundtrack - With luck we’ll compose additional music tracks for the game and release it as a DLC.
Hero’s avatars - you’ll be able to choose hero’s look from several avatars.
More colorful graphics and new special effects

<h3>BACK US NOW! YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Professor Martin Wright and I am running this crowdfunding on behalf of my organisation <a href=""http://www.gamelabuk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GamelabUK</a> - specialists in inclusive media. This project will make a difference to the perceptions of sign language among hearing folk as well as bringing  deaf and hearing kids together. No matter how small or large, all contributions backing this project will make a difference to our making a difference - so whether its £10 or £100 or even £1000 -   all support is most welcome. There are wonderful perks to be had too. For those unable to assist financially, we'd still love your support on spreading the Lizzie Lester message far and wide! Share with your friends, share on your social media channels, share everywhere and let the Lizzie message reach every corner of the globe! This is an international project. Now read on.... </p>
<p><strong>NB Some browsers show a default contribution of £100. You can change this to any value you may wish to donate. Every $/£/€ helps!</strong></p>
<h3>We Are . . . </h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.gamelabuk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GamelabUK</a>, a small but very innovative inclusive media studio with nine BAFTA nominations and two TIGA  awards ( The Independent Games Award) to our name</p>
<h3>Our Output</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.gamelabuk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GameLabUK</a> specialises in special needs users yet their outputs are so in demand and relevant that they appeal to a mainstream audience. This reverse inclusion has resulted in the production of cool audio games, deaf dramas, musicals, sign recognition games and much more.</p>
<h3>Our Latest Creation </h3>
<p>Lizzie Lester is the latest female animation hero to hit our screens and is the star of our series. She is many things – a detective, a squirrel and she is also Deaf. This doesn’t only add to her appeal as an inspirational hero for young kids, but she never lets it hold her back. She is ready to show a world of 4-6 year old ‘can-do’ kids, just what they can achieve when they put their mind to it.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG DEAF PEOPLE NEED LANGUAGE  </strong>  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561011344/xy2cqtkghpuowri0jlu9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Research indicates that 90% of deaf children are born into hearing families and it would seem that signing awareness can be a serious challenge within these families. It is not unusual for  5 year old D/deaf children to experience severe language deprivation. This in turn can lead to cognitive delay.  The Lizzie Lester game is to be a sign learning game which can be shared by hearing and deaf children alike encouraging sign language acquisition. </p>
<p><strong>LIZZIE LESTER GAME </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561011579/pj7vpf7jebseeurei43n.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The Lizzie Lester Game aims to create an inclusive space for Deaf and hearing children  to converge. Gaming and online interactions are an ideal way to bring deaf kids to the mainstream. Conversely, it also assists hearing kids with the ability to learn to sign.  Lizzie Lester provides an opportunity to engage parents and siblings of deaf kids with the learning of sign language in a fun and creative way.</p>
<p>The game revolves around the children (aged 4-6 years) searching for hidden objects and clues around several school-like environments. Lizzie signs clues and sets the children off on their treasure hunt adventure.</p>
<p>The novel features of our game include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability for Lizzie to sign in a variety of sign languages</li>
<li>Development of memory and logic skills</li>
<li>Engaging and unique characters</li>
<li>Some key word sign recognition (stretch goal)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CURRENT DEVELOPMENT  –  </strong>The Lizzie Lester Game is in animation pilot phase with character development, signing motion capture for localisation and initial narratives underway. The foundations have been set to launch the Lizzie Lester game to the next phase of development.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>FUNDING TO DATE AND FURTHER REQUIREMENTS</strong></h3>
<p>In partnership with Factory Create, Clive Juster Associates and December Media and grants from BSLBT and ACTF we have developed a ‘sizzle reel’ that explores both the characterisations and the signing localisation pipeline.  </p>
<p>We are now seeking further funds to support the initial development of the Lizzie Lester interactive game. The combination of an interactive app and TV animation series proposal will create an appealing investment opportunity for TV broadcasters. The initial buzz surrounding Lizzie Lester will be catapulted to the forefront with the addition of this interactive game component. It will complete the Lizzie Lester offering to create a compelling and irresistible package for Deaf and hearing children and their families across the globe.</p>
<p>Initial Game Funding Tasks include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Script Writing</li>
<li>World builds</li>
<li>Character refinement</li>
<li>Motion capture</li>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>User / Audience research / testing</li>
<li>Word recognition software – stretch goal</li>
</ul>
<p>To date we have already speculated much of our own resources into ensuring we have a reliable MoCap system in place as well as loveable characters.</p>
<p>The funding requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base project : £32 000</li>
<li>With stretch goal: £43 000</li>
</ul>

Our Output
GameLabUK specialises in special needs users yet their outputs are so in demand and relevant that they appeal to a mainstream audience. This reverse inclusion has resulted in the production of cool audio games, deaf dramas, musicals, sign recognition games and much more.
Our Latest Creation 
Lizzie Lester is the latest female animation hero to hit our screens and is the star of our series. She is many things – a detective, a squirrel and she is also Deaf. This doesn’t only add to her appeal as an inspirational hero for young kids, but she never lets it hold her back. She is ready to show a world of 4-6 year old ‘can-do’ kids, just what they can achieve when they put their mind to it.
YOUNG DEAF PEOPLE NEED LANGUAGE    

Research indicates that 90% of deaf children are born into hearing families and it would seem that signing awareness can be a serious challenge within these families. It is not unusual for  5 year old D/deaf children to experience severe language deprivation. This in turn can lead to cognitive delay.  The Lizzie Lester game is to be a sign learning game which can be shared by hearing and deaf children alike encouraging sign language acquisition. 
LIZZIE LESTER GAME 

The Lizzie Lester Game aims to create an inclusive space for Deaf and hearing children  to converge. Gaming and online interactions are an ideal way to bring deaf kids to the mainstream. Conversely, it also assists hearing kids with the ability to learn to sign.  Lizzie Lester provides an opportunity to engage parents and siblings of deaf kids with the learning of sign language in a fun and creative way.
The game revolves around the children (aged 4-6 years) searching for hidden objects and clues around several school-like environments. Lizzie signs clues and sets the children off on their treasure hunt adventure.
The novel features of our game include:

The ability for Lizzie to sign in a variety of sign languages
Development of memory and logic skills
Engaging and unique characters
Some key word sign recognition (stretch goal)

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT  –  The Lizzie Lester Game is in animation pilot phase with character development, signing motion capture for localisation and initial narratives underway. The foundations have been set to launch the Lizzie Lester game to the next phase of development.

FUNDING TO DATE AND FURTHER REQUIREMENTS
In partnership with Factory Create, Clive Juster Associates and December Media and grants from BSLBT and ACTF we have developed a ‘sizzle reel’ that explores both the characterisations and the signing localisation pipeline.  
We are now seeking further funds to support the initial development of the Lizzie Lester interactive game. The combination of an interactive app and TV animation series proposal will create an appealing investment opportunity for TV broadcasters. The initial buzz surrounding Lizzie Lester will be catapulted to the forefront with the addition of this interactive game component. It will complete the Lizzie Lester offering to create a compelling and irresistible package for Deaf and hearing children and their families across the globe.
Initial Game Funding Tasks include:-

Script Writing
World builds
Character refinement
Motion capture
Coding
User / Audience research / testing
Word recognition software – stretch goal

To date we have already speculated much of our own resources into ensuring we have a reliable MoCap system in place as well as loveable characters.
The funding requirements are as follows:

Base project : £32 000
With stretch goal: £43 000

The Impact
THE STATISTICS
Approximately 1 in every 1000 children is born with a severe or profound hearing loss.   90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents with little or no experience of deafness or knowledge of how to communicate with a deaf person. There are over 45,000 deaf children living in the UK.  Approximately 125,000 deaf people in the UK use British Sign Language (BSL) as their first or preferred language. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 5% of the world's population suffers from disabling hearing loss. Five percent may seem like a small number, but that totals over 360 million people across the globe.
The most widely used sign language is probably American Sign Language (ASL), which is used is the USA, Canada, parts of Mexico and, with modifications, in quite a few other countries in Central America, Asia and Africa.
THE NEED - We are in dire need of fresh and innovative media content that can be shared by Deaf and hearing kids and their families. It not only brings children together in an educational and fun environment but encourages inclusivity with deaf language and culture fully embedded in the product. Children are exposed to new cultures and human interactions without any hesitations, or pre-conceived judgements. The environment is inclusive, welcoming and a place for hearing and Deaf children to merge and be accepted and communicate feely as they are.
IMPACT – The Lizzie Lester app will be the world’s first, truly bilingual (Sign language and spoken language) application. This game changing app will bridge the gap between Deaf and hearing children, creating an inclusive and appealing platform to engage young children to communicate in ways they never thought possible.
