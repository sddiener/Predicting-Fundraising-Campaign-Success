<h1>What is World Bites anyway?</h1>
<p><b>The concept of World Bites is...peasant and street food from around 
the globe</b>. Some of the best dishes ever created have been made by common
 people, using the simplest ingredients and a lot of love. Those dishes 
have been perfected over time and today we would like to honor those 
people and share them with you.</p>
<p>World Bites LLC saw its start in 2009 at Farmers Markets on the 
streets of downtown Sarasota…Siesta Key…Bradenton. The demand for the 
food was instantaneous, and what was a humble start with providing food 
for hundreds of people grew quickly to thousands at such venues as music
 concerts, food festivals and food truck rallies.</p>
<p><b>In the recent history we have expanded into lunch delivery for the 
local businesses and with that attracted a whole new demographic.</b></p>
<p>At this point it is apparent that the commercial kitchen we were 
sharing isn’t big enough, nor convenient enough for our customers to get
 to. Another major drawback with it, is the lack of seating, and our 
customers are demanding a dining area.</p>
<p>With that in mind we have found a location that meets all our needs. 
It is conveniently located on <b>5119 North Tamiami Trail, Sarasota 34234</b>, and is 
surrounded by major colleges of the area…Ringling College and New 
College…as well as numerous restaurants and a vibrant business area. </p>
<p>The new location will be called World Bites Kafe where we will offer a
 wide variety of authentic international dishes, and unique world 
cuisine fusion dishes. We will also provide Turkish 
coffee, and our own homemade soft drinks including lemonade with variety
 of flavors. <b>(Yes there will be a whole menu of different flavors of lemonades!!) <br/></b></p>

</a><h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>The main objective of World Bites is to interlock citizens of the 
world, and break down whatever barriers there may be. One of the most 
ubiquitous ways this can be done is through portrayal of different 
cuisines each region of the globe has to offer.</p>
<p>Our overall goals are to provide excellent customer service and 
consistent product that our patrons can rely on time and time again. At 
the same time we want to get people interested in other cultures around 
the world, and maybe in some cases remind them of their own.</p>
<h1>Our Hope</h1>
<p>We hope that everyone who takes time to read this and watches our 
video to support us in any way they feel they can. Be it a donation and 
receiving a fun pledge from us, or simply letting others know about our 
mission to create a <b>""Cultural Oasis""</b>, as our fans call us. :)</p>
<p>This means sharing our food philosophy, keeping ourselves and our staff 
educated about the products we use, and enthusiastically offering that 
knowledge to our patrons. In this way, we hope to build a community of 
diners who care about their food and where it came from. And at the same time creating a 
healthy business, healthy community, and a healthier planet.<br/>Thank You!!!<br/><br/>-Team Kafe-</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Reasons for success...<br/>
</h1>
<p>In the last five years we most definitely have had our fair share of challenges. We watched our business grow and now we are ready to take the next step. <br/><br/>I personally have been in the food business for almost two decades now, and I held every position possible—in ""the front of the house"" as well as in ""the back of the house"". I am kind of like that Man vs Food guy, minus the huge appetite of course. <br/>I've worked in crazy busy diners of New York, and that was before the computerized POS systems! <br/>I also worked in fine dining restaurants where I learned some of the most valuable lessons in developing flavor profiles, and appreciating the ingredients that I use today in order to share my culinary story.<br/><br/>Even more essentially, in my career I opened 6 restaurants (4 private and 2 corporate). I have been a part of team in a build-out stage a number of times and there were some daunting tasks that we faced. <br/><b>I also worked at places that unfortunately went out of business. I saw firsthand what mistakes were being made, and more importantly I realized what was not being done. </b><br/><br/>There are many reason why restaurant business has such a high failure rate, but if knowledge of gastronomy, hospitality business and marketing are present within the company the likelihood of success will truly skyrocket. All those components are definitely present within our crew at World Bites Kafe.<br/><br/>We have a team that has nearly a half of a century of collective hospitality experience, vast marketing and digital media knowledge, massive networking prowess and a classically trained chef. <br/><b><br/>Finally and most importantly we have hard core fans, who believe in our mission of bringing authentic flavors from around the world to our community.</b> The kind of fans that have traveled and traveled to be with us at so many events that we did over the years, and who are now patiently waiting for our new location. <br/><br/>A special THANK YOU goes out to you, from the bottom of our hearts, and the bottom of our pots! :)</p>

<b><span>I.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Introduction</b>
</h1><h4><b><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>Transparency</b></h4>
<p><b>For those who
are not family or friends and don't know me, I want to assure you that your
contributions will be used to support constructing My English Center in Xieng
Khouag, Lao PDR. I realize that sometimes people are reluctant to give because
they don't know if their contributions will reach the right people, especially
given the mismanagement of funds that occur after large scale demanded. That is
why I think you should know a little about me so you can contribute knowing
that your money will be put to the best use. A promise to use the money to
construct My English Center to who really need the most and a very
transparent accounting of the money spent. </b></p>
<h4>
<b><span>2.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Who Is the founder of My English Center</b>
</h4>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Chao Yang. I am the founder of My English
Center. I was born in 1984 in a remote area call “BOUA MOUK” about 30 km from
Luang Prabang. I was orphaned at a very young age. My father passed away when I
was 3 years old. I grew up in a poor Hmong family, the last of 5 children and
the only one in the family who could go to school. <br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431670735/yu5ij0gjepopncusyacf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 390.764px; height: 404px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>I began school in 1991. From home to school, I had to
walk minimum 2-4 hours to school and return home through mountains, rivers, and
valleys every day. <span>My
mother sometime had to go with me to school because there was no student by
this time. She waited for me outside and sewed her clothes until the
class ended at 4 pm. We had to walk back home with no light. We sometime
arrived home when our neighbors had already gone to bed.</span></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431671001/eoojgofiociqz3qwedzr.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 404px; height: 303px;""/></p>
<p>Because of the
distance from home to school, my family decided to send me to school near Luang
Prabang two years later. I made the journey by
walking; there was no road at the time. It was a six-hour trip, and I didn’t
see my family again for nine months.</p>
<p>I stayed with a
cousin in Luang Prabagn. At around four o’clock every morning, I had to get up
to prepare our breakfast. I made the fire and put a pot to steam rice on it. I opened
my lesson and memorized my lessons in front of the fire because there was no
lamp/lighter at this time. At first I was very
unhappy and homesick, and sometimes I cried. </p>
<p>In 1999, I finished high school and wanted to continue
to the National University of Laos, but this was financially impossible due to
my mother’s death. So after high school, I worked for a while as a tour guide
at a trekking company but my abilities in English language were very limited. I
wanted to learn more but could not afford to continue my studies. I was very
fortunate that two of the foreign visitors in a trekking party offered to pay
for my studies at Lao-American College. With their continued support I recently
graduated with a Bachelor in Business Management on 29 March, 2013. <br/></p>

<h4>
<span>3.<span>  </span></span>Lao PDR. </h4>
<p>Lao PDR is the
heaviest bombed country per capita in history (<a href=""http://www.magamerica.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.magamerica.org</a>).  It is an area that was heavily
bombed by the US during the ""secret"" part of the Vietnam War, and
there are still bomb craters on the land. It is located in Southeast Asia and has a small
population, but a large number of young, innocent people living in the darkness
of illiteracy. The Lao PDR has the lowest education ranking among ASEAN
countries. </p>
<h4>
<span>4.<span>  </span></span>My English Center </h4>
<p>Was formed in November
2013, trying to
inspire English acquisition among villagers just outside of Luang Prabang city.
My English Center is planning to register as a non-profit Charity Project and committed to improving opportunities
for young people through English study and aims to enhance opportunities for
careers in the business and tourism sectors.</p>
<p>Luang Prabang
is the previous home of the Lao Royal King and today is a World Heritage City
as well as the 2015 Top City and Wanderlust Travel Award winner.  Huge
amounts of money flow into Luang  Prabang every year, but without the
ability to speak English, a person’s opportunities are very
limited. <br/></p><h4>
<span>5.<span> 
</span></span>But we need
your help! </h4>
<p>I desperately
want to help the people of my community, and with the Lao PDR joining the Asian
Economic Community (AEC) next year, there is no time to waste.  Without
skills in the international language (English), the children of the Lao PDR
won’t be able to compete and are destined to remain poor. </p>
<p>But my budget is tight,
and although my research has been thorough, I cannot do this on my own. I am
planning to raise the first $55,000 of its $250,000 budget to start this school
as soon as possible. It will be constructed on a total of 10,000 square meters
in Phieng Luang village, Phou Kout District, Xieng Khouang Province (<a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/R7zG6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/R7zG6</a>)

as part of my work to develop a business plan for the English language school,
I conducted a survey with 200 residents of Phou Kout district, Xieng Khuang
Province: 78 were high school students, 35 business and shop owners, 28
teachers, 13 officers, and 46 others. I learned that there are about 5,000
students in 4 public high schools but have very limited access to English
classes – only 2 hours a week. I also learned that many boys’ best option is to
become a novice at a temple.  Sometimes on weekend, many of students who
come from different rural area will have to stay at their small own house
(dormitory) at school. What they (girls) have to do before and after school or
free time is to sew in order to have some money to buy their study materials.
Besides that, they have to find firewood, food (fishing along rivers and get
natural plants around firm field) and cook for themselves while boys are
working hard digging channels to get some money. 

<p>Very few have
the skills to work at restaurants, hotels, or trekking agencies and without the
financial means to continue school, many just quit and work with their
families.  </p>
<p>Therefore many
give up hope of ever finishing high school or going to college to continue
their education and get stuck at this point. Many students leave school with
sadness when they realize that their parents cannot support them for further
studies and they have to leave school without the education necessary to get a
decent job. </p>
<p>This is a
problem especially for young girls who do not have the same flexibility as boys
to find a job or on-the-job training. <br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-_DoSuBUXxo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-_DoSuBUXxo&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-_DoSuBUXxo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>I personally
have great difficulty seeing poor children, and especially those who have lost
their parents at a very young age.  There are a lot of people who are very
angry, but can say nothing to anyone.  That is just how things are. I
think if you look at those older people today complaining about their parents
who do not allow them to go to school. But this is not what I wanted to focus
on. What I really want to focus on are the children who are living right now
and work to make sure that in their future, they will not be trapped in the
darkness of illiteracy.

<p>There is
currently a serious shortage of employable workers in the Lao PDR.  And
people are hesitant to build factories here because if a person can’t read,
then they can’t learn how to do a job.  I am committed to changing that by
partnering with the government, individuals, NGOs or others.</p>
<h4>
<span>8.<span>  </span></span>Statistic </h4>
<p>Many poor
students cannot continue to higher education levels because they lack money and
if they drop-out it can be very difficult for them to find jobs. When families
do not have enough money to support their children at school, they tell their
children to drop out of school which is illustrated by the Ministry of
Education statistics for </p>
<ul>
<li><b>2011-2012, showing that
     enrollment rates dropped from 69,934 at the Primary school level to 27,659

<p>Many high
school graduates cannot enter college or university because of lack of funds;
therefore many give up hope of ever going to college to continue their
education and get stuck at this point.</p>

<b><span>II.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Call For Action </b>
</h1>
<h4>
<b><span>1.<span> 
</span></span></b>School Started</h4>
<p>In November of
2013, we started teaching a free class in a Hmong village on the outskirts of
Luang Prabang, named Ban Khouathi nung (Village by the first bridge). Through a
temporary arrangement, the village is allowing us to use an area as a
classroom. During the first week about 10 students came to the class. They were
so excited to study English. One girl carried her baby sister to the class. We
started at 4:30 pm and ended when they could no longer see when it got dark.
 There were no fans or electricity installed in the classroom.</p>
<p>We
successfully raised US$2,789 by Dec 19<sup>th</sup>, 2013. Due to a recently announced
government regulation, public schools are not to be used by any private
parties, so we built a small classroom out of wood and bamboo.  We had
electricity installed, bought a projector, 10 sets of tables and benches, and a
white board.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431671321/e2znfoeqw2czllneokdq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 369px; height: 246px;""/></p>
<p>There were 24
primary school students, 14 high school students, and 3 university teachers
attending at My English Center now and they were getting much better in English
after studying at MEC for about 18 months.  During this time, we invited
local teachers and visitors to Luang Prabang to come and teach at the school to
give the students the opportunity to be exposed to different accents.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431671274/f87kh8hnsqnnxbs9ovcb.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 366.667px; height: 275px;""/></p>
<p>Most of the
students are from relatively poor backgrounds but through the foundation are
given the same chance as other young people to develop English skills and
benefit from the opportunities that will arise as Laos develops.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F1Q0TC15kUI4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1Q0TC15kUI4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1Q0TC15kUI4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h4>2. Objevtive.

</h4><p>MEC (My
English Center) is a unique environment where boys and girls can study, develop
their minds, gain confidence and play sports together. With this purpose, the
Foundation provides free English study for young people in Luang Prabang and a
platform to practice language and hospitality skills. In the future, we will
also offer computer skills and free Internet access to support young people’s
studies.</p>
<p>MEC hosts
inspirational guest speakers and arranges field trips to local attractions,
encouraging young people to contribute to and learn about their community.
Another goal of MEC is to give students the opportunity to develop service
skills by volunteering within the local community. Working with local and
international organizations, MEC strives to increase career opportunities in
hospitality, tourism, teaching and industry.</p>
<p>MEC also aims
to support and train local teachers, improving general teaching skills within
the community and running corporate English training programs for local
businesses and film makers. </p>
<p>MEC provides
instruction to high school, college/university students for international
tests, such as IELT and TOEFL, so that they can apply for opportunities to
continue studying and win scholarships to study abroad. </p>
<p>The result
will be that under-privileged students will be able to continue their education
and, with their ability to speak English, they will be in a much better
position to get a good job. We will especially target girls as they have a more
difficult time getting an education and finding decent work in our society.</p>

always ask me is that what choice who we want to be in next 20 years? Do we

commit ourselves to society that everyone could extremely be literately and
depend on ourselves instead of other outsides’ help? </p>

Introduction
1. 
Transparency
For those who
are not family or friends and don't know me, I want to assure you that your
contributions will be used to support constructing My English Center in Xieng
Khouag, Lao PDR. I realize that sometimes people are reluctant to give because
they don't know if their contributions will reach the right people, especially
given the mismanagement of funds that occur after large scale demanded. That is
why I think you should know a little about me so you can contribute knowing
that your money will be put to the best use. A promise to use the money to
construct My English Center to who really need the most and a very
transparent accounting of the money spent. 

2. 
Who Is the founder of My English Center


My name is Chao Yang. I am the founder of My English
Center. I was born in 1984 in a remote area call “BOUA MOUK” about 30 km from
Luang Prabang. I was orphaned at a very young age. My father passed away when I
was 3 years old. I grew up in a poor Hmong family, the last of 5 children and
the only one in the family who could go to school. 


I began school in 1991. From home to school, I had to
walk minimum 2-4 hours to school and return home through mountains, rivers, and
valleys every day. My
mother sometime had to go with me to school because there was no student by
this time. She waited for me outside and sewed her clothes until the
class ended at 4 pm. We had to walk back home with no light. We sometime
arrived home when our neighbors had already gone to bed.

Because of the
distance from home to school, my family decided to send me to school near Luang
Prabang two years later. I made the journey by
walking; there was no road at the time. It was a six-hour trip, and I didn’t
see my family again for nine months.
I stayed with a
cousin in Luang Prabagn. At around four o’clock every morning, I had to get up
to prepare our breakfast. I made the fire and put a pot to steam rice on it. I opened
my lesson and memorized my lessons in front of the fire because there was no
lamp/lighter at this time. At first I was very
unhappy and homesick, and sometimes I cried. 
In 1999, I finished high school and wanted to continue
to the National University of Laos, but this was financially impossible due to
my mother’s death. So after high school, I worked for a while as a tour guide
at a trekking company but my abilities in English language were very limited. I
wanted to learn more but could not afford to continue my studies. I was very
fortunate that two of the foreign visitors in a trekking party offered to pay
for my studies at Lao-American College. With their continued support I recently
graduated with a Bachelor in Business Management on 29 March, 2013. 
This is a video clip in Hmong with English subtitle. 

3.  Lao PDR. 
Lao PDR is the
heaviest bombed country per capita in history (http://www.magamerica.org).  It is an area that was heavily
bombed by the US during the ""secret"" part of the Vietnam War, and
there are still bomb craters on the land. It is located in Southeast Asia and has a small
population, but a large number of young, innocent people living in the darkness
of illiteracy. The Lao PDR has the lowest education ranking among ASEAN
countries. 

4.  My English Center 
Was formed in November
2013, trying to
inspire English acquisition among villagers just outside of Luang Prabang city.
My English Center is planning to register as a non-profit Charity Project and committed to improving opportunities
for young people through English study and aims to enhance opportunities for
careers in the business and tourism sectors.
Luang Prabang
is the previous home of the Lao Royal King and today is a World Heritage City
as well as the 2015 Top City and Wanderlust Travel Award winner.  Huge
amounts of money flow into Luang  Prabang every year, but without the
ability to speak English, a person’s opportunities are very
limited. 
5. 
But we need
your help! 
I desperately
want to help the people of my community, and with the Lao PDR joining the Asian
Economic Community (AEC) next year, there is no time to waste.  Without
skills in the international language (English), the children of the Lao PDR
won’t be able to compete and are destined to remain poor. 
But my budget is tight,
and although my research has been thorough, I cannot do this on my own. I am
planning to raise the first $55,000 of its $250,000 budget to start this school
as soon as possible. It will be constructed on a total of 10,000 square meters
in Phieng Luang village, Phou Kout District, Xieng Khouang Province (https://goo.gl/maps/R7zG6)
where Laos' Plain of Jars - the next
UNESCO World Heritage site. (http://travel-lao-isaan.blogspot.com/2010/01/laos-plain-of-jars-next-unesco-world.html) 
Your generous
contribution will aid My English Center in many ways and will go towards
purchasing as below: 

A license: 5,000$.
Labor: 12,000$. 
Materials to construct the first
     part of school: 25,000$. 
Books and equipments: 11,000$
1. US$5 contribution can purchase a piece of steel. 2. US$10 contribution can purchase 52 bricks.  3. US$ 30 contribution can purchase 5 packs of cement. 

4. US$50 contribution can purchase 25 tiles 


5. US$ 100 contribution can purchase 5 trucks of gravel.

7.  Why Should My English Center be built.
The Lao PDR
currently does not have any standardized education system, but I would like to
change that. I would like Lao PDR to have an organized education system on par
with America, Britain, Italy, Australia and Japan. 
I would like to change a story of Laos
from a country where people rarely speak English into a country that everyone
can speak excellent English by building My English Center and extend it to the whole country. November 2014,
as part of my work to develop a business plan for the English language school,
I conducted a survey with 200 residents of Phou Kout district, Xieng Khuang
Province: 78 were high school students, 35 business and shop owners, 28
teachers, 13 officers, and 46 others. I learned that there are about 5,000
students in 4 public high schools but have very limited access to English
classes – only 2 hours a week. I also learned that many boys’ best option is to
become a novice at a temple.  Sometimes on weekend, many of students who
come from different rural area will have to stay at their small own house
(dormitory) at school. What they (girls) have to do before and after school or
free time is to sew in order to have some money to buy their study materials.
Besides that, they have to find firewood, food (fishing along rivers and get
natural plants around firm field) and cook for themselves while boys are
working hard digging channels to get some money. 

Very few have
the skills to work at restaurants, hotels, or trekking agencies and without the
financial means to continue school, many just quit and work with their
families.  
Therefore many
give up hope of ever finishing high school or going to college to continue
their education and get stuck at this point. Many students leave school with
sadness when they realize that their parents cannot support them for further
studies and they have to leave school without the education necessary to get a
decent job. 
This is a
problem especially for young girls who do not have the same flexibility as boys
to find a job or on-the-job training. I personally
have great difficulty seeing poor children, and especially those who have lost
their parents at a very young age.  There are a lot of people who are very
angry, but can say nothing to anyone.  That is just how things are. I
think if you look at those older people today complaining about their parents
who do not allow them to go to school. But this is not what I wanted to focus
on. What I really want to focus on are the children who are living right now
and work to make sure that in their future, they will not be trapped in the
darkness of illiteracy.

There is
currently a serious shortage of employable workers in the Lao PDR.  And
people are hesitant to build factories here because if a person can’t read,
then they can’t learn how to do a job.  I am committed to changing that by

Many poor
students cannot continue to higher education levels because they lack money and
if they drop-out it can be very difficult for them to find jobs. When families
do not have enough money to support their children at school, they tell their
children to drop out of school which is illustrated by the Ministry of
Education statistics for 

2011-2012, showing that
     enrollment rates dropped from 69,934 at the Primary school level to 27,659
     at the Secondary school level, and then dropped even further to only
     10,573 High School students in Xieng Khouang Province. 
2012-2013: 42,317 at the Primary
     school level, 23,576 at the Secondary school level, 10,344 High School
     students in Xieng Khouang Province. 

Many high
school graduates cannot enter college or university because of lack of funds;
therefore many give up hope of ever going to college to continue their
education and get stuck at this point.

II. 
Call For Action 


1. 
School Started
In November of
2013, we started teaching a free class in a Hmong village on the outskirts of
Luang Prabang, named Ban Khouathi nung (Village by the first bridge). Through a
temporary arrangement, the village is allowing us to use an area as a
classroom. During the first week about 10 students came to the class. They were
so excited to study English. One girl carried her baby sister to the class. We
started at 4:30 pm and ended when they could no longer see when it got dark.
 There were no fans or electricity installed in the classroom.
We
successfully raised US$2,789 by Dec 19th, 2013. Due to a recently announced
government regulation, public schools are not to be used by any private
parties, so we built a small classroom out of wood and bamboo.  We had
electricity installed, bought a projector, 10 sets of tables and benches, and a
white board.
There were 24
primary school students, 14 high school students, and 3 university teachers
attending at My English Center now and they were getting much better in English
after studying at MEC for about 18 months.  During this time, we invited
local teachers and visitors to Luang Prabang to come and teach at the school to
give the students the opportunity to be exposed to different accents.
Most of the
students are from relatively poor backgrounds but through the foundation are
given the same chance as other young people to develop English skills and
benefit from the opportunities that will arise as Laos develops.2. Objevtive.

MEC (My
English Center) is a unique environment where boys and girls can study, develop
their minds, gain confidence and play sports together. With this purpose, the
Foundation provides free English study for young people in Luang Prabang and a
platform to practice language and hospitality skills. In the future, we will
also offer computer skills and free Internet access to support young people’s
studies.
MEC hosts
inspirational guest speakers and arranges field trips to local attractions,
encouraging young people to contribute to and learn about their community.
Another goal of MEC is to give students the opportunity to develop service
skills by volunteering within the local community. Working with local and
international organizations, MEC strives to increase career opportunities in
hospitality, tourism, teaching and industry.
MEC also aims
to support and train local teachers, improving general teaching skills within
the community and running corporate English training programs for local
businesses and film makers. 
MEC provides
instruction to high school, college/university students for international
tests, such as IELT and TOEFL, so that they can apply for opportunities to
continue studying and win scholarships to study abroad. 
The result
will be that under-privileged students will be able to continue their education
and, with their ability to speak English, they will be in a much better
position to get a good job. We will especially target girls as they have a more
difficult time getting an education and finding decent work in our society.
3. The Impact
The question I
always ask me is that what choice who we want to be in next 20 years? Do we
accept the society that only a few of us can do spectacularly well or will we
commit ourselves to society that everyone could extremely be literately and
depend on ourselves instead of other outsides’ help? 
Since My
English Center was created, there have been several travelers who visited Luang
Prabang, the World Heritage city, spend their free time to teach English at my
English Center as below.

<p>We’ve spent the last year and half working with hundreds of these orphaned and vulnerable children, through our doll making workshops, offering them an opportunity to experience joy, relief through creative expression, self-reflection, process some of what they have been through and most importantly, control one piece of their world. Each of the workshops were made possible through the sales of our hand-crafted, personalizable, limited edition cloth dolls.</p>

<p>However, we would like to give the MILLIONS of children orphaned around the world an opportunity to benefit from our program. To do so, we've thoughtfully packaged our art workshops into a DIY DOLL KIT that makes giving back more accessible and fun for everyone! <b>You can now design a Dumyé doll of your own and for each kit purchased we gift a doll to an orphan in need, through one of our doll making workshops. </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Together we can bring love and light to not only our children but also the children who have not been spoken for.</span></p>

their social consciousness. Oh, and it’s super fun too! <p></p>
<p>Children live in a world where they're 'smallest in command'. However through pretend play, especially with a smaller human form (aka doll), children have<span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the opportunity to be in charge and permission to explore behavior and concepts that would otherwise be considered unacceptable. A child's most natural form of communication is in art and play - both things the DIY DOLL KIT </span>capitalizes<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> on.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Through our DIY DOLL KIT, children will have the opportunity to hone skills such as:</b> </span></span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">hand-eye coordination</span><br/>
</li>

<li>visualization<br/>
</li>
<li>problem solving</li>
<li>perseverance</li>
</ul>
<p><b>But what makes the DIY Doll Kit so incredibly special is what it represents, the impact it makes and the beautiful opportunity to share those values with your children through the process.</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Giving back is life's greatest gift. For each DIY DOLL KIT purchased an orphan in need will be gifted a doll too.</li>
<li>These dolls are made with Fair Trade Organic cotton - meaning they respect both humanity and our mother earth because there is no joy in succeeding at the misfortune of others.</li>
<li>The dolls are stitched together by an NGO in one of the poorest states of India, economically empowering these women and in turn, they use their proceeds to educate the next generation of girls in their community. So cool, right?! </li>
</ul>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h1>So Whats Inside The Cute Little Cardboard Suitcase Anyway?</h1>
<p>Well it depends on which DIY DOLL KIT you choose but one thing is for sure... your kids are going to love it. If you're familiar with Dumyé then you know that our passion for giving is only rivaled by our passion for design. Our DIY DOLL KIT's are no exception.

<h1>How It All Began</h1>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FKZ0ILgX6s-A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKZ0ILgX6s-A&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKZ0ILgX6s-A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<blockquote>“DESIGN HAS THE POWER TO SHAPE OUR WORLD FOR THE BETTER.” <span>- Sahar Wahbeh, Founder Dumyé</span>
</blockquote>
<p>The story of Dumyé begins after this designer became a mother to an enchanting little girl. It was the holidays and Sahar Wahbeh, wanted to gift her daughter a really special doll – a toy that would hopefully one day become synonymous with her daughter’s childhood. She, searched high and low for such a doll but found nothing that captured her little girl’s spirit or her own heart. Wherever she looked, she found dolls that did not represent the values or the aesthetic she was seeking. Inspiration struck and after a trip to NYC’s garment district the idea began to form. Sahar dusted off her mother’s vintage sewing machine, made a workspace out of an old ping pong table and got to it.</p>
<p>However, Dumyé didn't come to fruition until Sahar saw the opportunity to use the dolls as a way to not only share her values with her daughter but to actually live by them. Things like respecting Mother Nature, so Dumyé dolls are made with a mixture of organic, sustainable and mostly natural materials. Things like, having compassion for our fellow (wo)men, which is why we commission an NGO in one of the poorest states of India to handle elements of our production. This allows us to empower the women in their community to be self sufficient, while they use their proceeds to educate the next generation of girls. Things like, knowing in our hearts that the real gift in life is in the giving. So for every doll that we sell we gift a doll to one of the approximately 136 million (UNICEF 2008) children orphaned around the world.</p>
<p>Dumyé began as a living lesson to Sahar's daughter, but it has become a lesson to children living in more than 15 countries spanning the globe and is responsible for hundreds of orphans receiving meaningful dolls of their own.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s Dumyé's hope, that when our generation passes the reigns to our children, we’ll be leaving them to a world better then the one we were born to.</p>

<p><b>Q3: Why do you need our help to bring the DIY Doll Kit to market?</b></p>
<div>Up until this point we have made the dolls we sell in our small Dubai studio. However producing these DIY Doll Kits requires us to work with various manufacturers who have minimums... ours is 5,000! We need your help to fund the production.</div>
<div>
<p><b>Q4: Why can't I add more than one 'perk' to my contribution?</b></p>
<p>We have gotten quite a few emails about this. Unfortunately, Indiegogo only allows you to check out with one perk at a time. If you would like to 'purchase' more than one perk, you will have to check out with each one separately. We apologies for the inconvenience but appreciate your support!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q5: How do I choose and personalize my Limited Edition or Petite Dumyé doll?</b></p>
<p>Once we are ready to make your special doll, we will be in touch to find out which doll you would like specifically and how you would like it personalized. Easy peasy.</p>

Picture from Dumyé workshop held in Syrian refugee camp in Lebanon
We’ve spent the last year and half working with hundreds of these orphaned and vulnerable children, through our doll making workshops, offering them an opportunity to experience joy, relief through creative expression, self-reflection, process some of what they have been through and most importantly, control one piece of their world. Each of the workshops were made possible through the sales of our hand-crafted, personalizable, limited edition cloth dolls.

However, we would like to give the MILLIONS of children orphaned around the world an opportunity to benefit from our program. To do so, we've thoughtfully packaged our art workshops into a DIY DOLL KIT that makes giving back more accessible and fun for everyone! You can now design a Dumyé doll of your own and for each kit purchased we gift a doll to an orphan in need, through one of our doll making workshops. Together we can bring love and light to not only our children but also the children who have not been spoken for.


Introducing the DIY DOLL KIT



Inspired by the art workshops we conduct with orphans, the (Do It Yourself) DIY DOLL KIT taps into the power of your child’s innate creative spirit while raising
their social consciousness. Oh, and it’s super fun too! 
Children live in a world where they're 'smallest in command'. However through pretend play, especially with a smaller human form (aka doll), children have the opportunity to be in charge and permission to explore behavior and concepts that would otherwise be considered unacceptable. A child's most natural form of communication is in art and play - both things the DIY DOLL KIT capitalizes on.
Through our DIY DOLL KIT, children will have the opportunity to hone skills such as: 



hand-eye coordination

fine motor
design
creative thinking
visualization

problem solving
perseverance

But what makes the DIY Doll Kit so incredibly special is what it represents, the impact it makes and the beautiful opportunity to share those values with your children through the process.


Giving back is life's greatest gift. For each DIY DOLL KIT purchased an orphan in need will be gifted a doll too.
These dolls are made with Fair Trade Organic cotton - meaning they respect both humanity and our mother earth because there is no joy in succeeding at the misfortune of others.
The dolls are stitched together by an NGO in one of the poorest states of India, economically empowering these women and in turn, they use their proceeds to educate the next generation of girls in their community. So cool, right?! 


So Whats Inside The Cute Little Cardboard Suitcase Anyway?
Well it depends on which DIY DOLL KIT you choose but one thing is for sure... your kids are going to love it. If you're familiar with Dumyé then you know that our passion for giving is only rivaled by our passion for design. Our DIY DOLL KIT's are no exception. We have sourced some beautiful materials for you.





Each DIY Doll Kit comes with:

1 x a-dorable, re-usable, kraft suitcase - great for keeping all those craft supplies tidy.
1 x blank stuffed, Fair Trade organic cotton doll (approx. 40 cm tall) - with the Dumyé signature Purpose Pocket™. This a special pocket on the backside of the doll, holding a blank piece of cloth, waiting to keep a meaningful message or great big dream safely tucked away.
8 x non-toxic permanent fabric marker colors (blue, orange, yellow, purple, pink, green, red, black)
3 x unique natural cotton fabrics, each 20 x 40 cm 
1 x matching wool roving 'knot'
1 x skien of matching cotton thread
2 x matching felt pieces made of 100%, BPA free, post consumer plastic 
1 x workbook with coloring activity, basic sewing instructions, sample clothing patterns and doll design inspiration to get the juices flowing
2 x sewing needles in a pouch
1 x surprise accessory ( paper flowers / pom poms / wooden beads)



How It All Began



“DESIGN HAS THE POWER TO SHAPE OUR WORLD FOR THE BETTER.” - Sahar Wahbeh, Founder Dumyé

The story of Dumyé begins after this designer became a mother to an enchanting little girl. It was the holidays and Sahar Wahbeh, wanted to gift her daughter a really special doll – a toy that would hopefully one day become synonymous with her daughter’s childhood. She, searched high and low for such a doll but found nothing that captured her little girl’s spirit or her own heart. Wherever she looked, she found dolls that did not represent the values or the aesthetic she was seeking. Inspiration struck and after a trip to NYC’s garment district the idea began to form. Sahar dusted off her mother’s vintage sewing machine, made a workspace out of an old ping pong table and got to it.
However, Dumyé didn't come to fruition until Sahar saw the opportunity to use the dolls as a way to not only share her values with her daughter but to actually live by them. Things like respecting Mother Nature, so Dumyé dolls are made with a mixture of organic, sustainable and mostly natural materials. Things like, having compassion for our fellow (wo)men, which is why we commission an NGO in one of the poorest states of India to handle elements of our production. This allows us to empower the women in their community to be self sufficient, while they use their proceeds to educate the next generation of girls. Things like, knowing in our hearts that the real gift in life is in the giving. So for every doll that we sell we gift a doll to one of the approximately 136 million (UNICEF 2008) children orphaned around the world.
Dumyé began as a living lesson to Sahar's daughter, but it has become a lesson to children living in more than 15 countries spanning the globe and is responsible for hundreds of orphans receiving meaningful dolls of their own.  
Ultimately, it’s Dumyé's hope, that when our generation passes the reigns to our children, we’ll be leaving them to a world better then the one we were born to.

Karmic Goodness™







 Karmic Goodness is the positive ripple created when you purchase a doll from Dumyé. 



Dumyé customer with her limited edition Harvest doll #MyDumye

Let's start with the child you purchased a Dumyé doll for... They receive a personal and meaningful gift, that they will cherish for many years to come. But there's more, because they will know that a child, far away and far less fortunate, will also have the opportunity to create a doll - thanks to your purchase. Raising our youths social consciousness is important because they are our future world leaders. Let's get them off to a good start.


Orphaned Syrian Refugee in a Dumyé workshop

Let's shift focus to the orphan who receives a doll, because of your purchase, through our doll making workshops. This offers them an opportunity to experience joy, relief through creative expression, self-reflection, process some of what they have been through and most importantly, control one piece of their world. Under the Convention on the Rights of a Child, UNICEF declared that it is every child's human right to have access to 'play, and to join in a wide
range of cultural, artistic and other recreational activities.' (Article 31) Your purchase enables us to provide that for an orphaned or vulnerable child, helping to restore their childhood.



Partner NGO in Anupshahar, India

Next we want to talk about our commitment to supporting women. We currently partner with an NGO in one of the poorest states of India, allowing us to support economic opportunity for women and in turn they use their proceeds to educate the next generation of girls in their community. All statistics prove that when women succeed, economies and communities flourish.  



Lastly, our impact on the earth... All of our dolls are made with a mixture of organic, sustainable and natural materials. We only have one Mother Earth, so let's work together to preserve it.


FAQ



Q1: Who are DIY Doll Kits meant for?

We designed them for children 5 - 100 years old - boys and girls alike.

Q2: Who are your Petite Dumyé & Limited Edition Dumyé dolls meant for?

We designed them for children 3+ years old but let's be honest... you are never too old to have a beautiful doll!

Q3: Why do you need our help to bring the DIY Doll Kit to market?
Up until this point we have made the dolls we sell in our small Dubai studio. However producing these DIY Doll Kits requires us to work with various manufacturers who have minimums... ours is 5,000! We need your help to fund the production.

Q4: Why can't I add more than one 'perk' to my contribution?
We have gotten quite a few emails about this. Unfortunately, Indiegogo only allows you to check out with one perk at a time. If you would like to 'purchase' more than one perk, you will have to check out with each one separately. We apologies for the inconvenience but appreciate your support!

Q5: How do I choose and personalize my Limited Edition or Petite Dumyé doll?
Once we are ready to make your special doll, we will be in touch to find out which doll you would like specifically and how you would like it personalized. Easy peasy.


Q6: OMG I love what your doing. Tell me how else I can help!

<p>Situated in one of the little countries in the
world, i feel that I am strategically at an advantage because i'm a blogger
living in Sri Lanka. I started my journey as a freelancer about 4 years from
now. I've had a very difficult phase which was full of struggle and
disappointments.</p>
<p>I started my blog at <a href=""http://www.blogmost.com&lt;/a&gt;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.blogmost.com</a> against the wish
of my parents with hope that i would be able to make my mark somewhere in the
long run. My struggle did not end here because keeping the blog running was a
higher responsibility than before. But i was ready for any thing that life
throws my way.</p>
<p>I slowly started delving deep into the world of internet,
blogging and SEO. Internet started inspiring and kept on becoming more
determined by every passing day. I wrote all of my experiences in form of some
tutorials for the people to benefit from and the response has been good, in
fact, better than i had expected initially.</p>
<p>I became convinced about the fact that i really can make a
difference by using my pen. My blog grew into a large reservoir of information
to cater to all kinds of people over the internet.</p>
<p>I built many services like SEO assistance, Blog building,
traffic flow enhancement, blog development, social media integration
back-linking processes.</p>
<p>I also covered many genres like Business, money making,
education, health, entertainment, movies, blogging, gaming platforms,
electronics, gadgets, reviews, home and gardening, pets, parenting,
relationships and family.</p>
<p>So far, the result is that my website has grown to a stage
where i currently get more than 20,000+ global visitors monthly. Unfortunately,
i do not have enough funds in order to propagate my website towards expansion.
Hence, the growth and development of my website has stalled and I am trying not
to lose hope by every passing day.</p>
<p>I am standing at a critical stage where it will be my
downfall if i am unable to do something about it. The hard work that i have
invested into the website could be very fruitful and rewarding for all in the
future only if could keep it going with some help from others.</p>
<p>I am fully equipped with knowledge and skills but the only
factor which is holding me from contributing more to the community is the lack
of funds.</p>
<p>My website acting as the propagation channel, i want to be
able to reach out to people and the different communities around the world. I
have had a great response till now based on the useful knowledge that i have
imparted to thousands of people but it should not end here.</p>
<p>I want to reach out to a larger group around the world and i
believe that this cannot be done without a helping hand as this is entirely a
community effort.</p>
<p>One should not feel that they would not get anything in
return of helping me out because i have plenty of perks in store for you. In
fact, i will be giving much more in return than i receive here.</p>
<p>It is going to be a mutual and community effort, by the community,
for the community.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1205451/files/20150208023420-10277825_301689633326910_8815914469687434072_n.png?1423391660"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Current scenario</b></h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>My website has been fairly progressing till date. There had
been enough traffic and a good number of visitors each day. But surely, it
requires a considerable amount of regular investment before a website becomes
self-sufficient and start rolling and reaping benefits on its own.</p>
<p>Due to lack of resources and funds, I am unable to keep the
progress going forward. I have the right kind of skills and knowledge that  are required in order to maintain and develop
a blogging portal but it surely requires more than that.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to some investors and
contributors who can be a part of this process. You can expect some amazing
perks and offers in return in terms of many services that are listed on my
website. You are going to be a part of it, so rest assured.</p>
<p>You will be granted full access to my domain and you will be
able to experience each and every detail as we progress together. All the funds
will be used entirely in making our portal a better place for the members of
the community that will be visiting it to gain benefits.</p>
<p>A good response is pretty much assured from my website
because it already has a good number of traffic and the main obstacle of
launching it has already been crossed and left behind. My work is already in
existence and i have created a great number of followers and supporters in the
mean time when i had been struggling hard.</p>
<p>The large number of visitors on my website and the followers
on my various social media portals is a clear indicator of the fact that there
should not be any problem in the future. Hence, success and the right kind of
development is very much ensured in the future when we have enough amount of
funds in order to carry the work forward.</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>The Developing Plan</b></h3><p></p>
<p>We currently are in need of funds as there are several
things that need to be taken care of in order to let the development and
progress of the website be done in a periodic way and in an efficient manner.
We have thoroughly investigated the current scenario and have done considerable
amount of research in the market and on the world wide web so that we can
exactly know where we currently stand, what is to be done and what are the
estimated costs, time and deadlines associated with it.</p>
<p>We have allocated and broken down the amount of funds
required in the following sections:</p>
<p><b>Developmental
Overhaul of the entire structural design and Framework</b>: - $1500</p>
<p>We have realized the need for change. Dynamic nature is
always important because change is the only entity which we are synonymous to.</p>
<p>The templates and the structures of the website will need to
be re-constructed in order to have an enhanced user appeal and more
accessibility by the users. An efficient User Interface and be a major factor
in the long run as it is something that can improve the user experience as it
guides and facilitates the user in reaching out to where they exactly want to.</p>
<p>These changes might seem to be small at first but they
contribute in a big way later on as we will see.</p>
<p><b>The Design Makeover:</b>
- $1500</p>
<p>The layout and design of a website should be built in such a
way that it pleases to they senses of the audience and they actually enjoying
browsing around on your website. A badly or poorly designed website can be a
huge turn off for the audiences as it shows and conveys a lot about the
dedication that the owner has put into it.</p>
<p>More than half of the work is done if the appearance and
appeal of the website is satisfactory.</p>
<p><b>The specialized SEO
campaign</b>: - $4000</p>
<p>Every portal requires some means in order to be existent and
findable over the world wide web. The internet is flooding and is full of
websites and resources related to almost every thing that a person can imagine.</p>
<p>So, how does your audience search for something in one of
the search engines and find your links? This is where the Search Engine
Optimization techniques kick in. This is a very vast and complex topic in
itself because usually it is not so simple to attract traffic and audience to
your website.</p>
<p>There are many ways and techniques by the use of which one
can improve the ranks of their websites and we too need to do the same so that
people can reach out to us first instead of wandering somewhere else.</p>
<p>This is a very rigorous process and requires a considerable
amount of time and dedication in order to be successful. Proper kinds of SEO

Situated in one of the little countries in the
world, i feel that I am strategically at an advantage because i'm a blogger
living in Sri Lanka. I started my journey as a freelancer about 4 years from
now. I've had a very difficult phase which was full of struggle and
disappointments.
I started my blog at www.blogmost.com against the wish
of my parents with hope that i would be able to make my mark somewhere in the
long run. My struggle did not end here because keeping the blog running was a
higher responsibility than before. But i was ready for any thing that life
throws my way.
I slowly started delving deep into the world of internet,
blogging and SEO. Internet started inspiring and kept on becoming more
determined by every passing day. I wrote all of my experiences in form of some
tutorials for the people to benefit from and the response has been good, in
fact, better than i had expected initially.
I became convinced about the fact that i really can make a
difference by using my pen. My blog grew into a large reservoir of information
to cater to all kinds of people over the internet.
I built many services like SEO assistance, Blog building,
traffic flow enhancement, blog development, social media integration
back-linking processes.
I also covered many genres like Business, money making,
education, health, entertainment, movies, blogging, gaming platforms,
electronics, gadgets, reviews, home and gardening, pets, parenting,
relationships and family.
So far, the result is that my website has grown to a stage
where i currently get more than 20,000+ global visitors monthly. Unfortunately,
i do not have enough funds in order to propagate my website towards expansion.
Hence, the growth and development of my website has stalled and I am trying not
to lose hope by every passing day.
I am standing at a critical stage where it will be my
downfall if i am unable to do something about it. The hard work that i have
invested into the website could be very fruitful and rewarding for all in the
future only if could keep it going with some help from others.
I am fully equipped with knowledge and skills but the only
factor which is holding me from contributing more to the community is the lack
of funds.
My website acting as the propagation channel, i want to be
able to reach out to people and the different communities around the world. I
have had a great response till now based on the useful knowledge that i have
imparted to thousands of people but it should not end here.
I want to reach out to a larger group around the world and i
believe that this cannot be done without a helping hand as this is entirely a
community effort.
One should not feel that they would not get anything in
return of helping me out because i have plenty of perks in store for you. In
fact, i will be giving much more in return than i receive here.
It is going to be a mutual and community effort, by the community,
for the community.
Current scenario

My website has been fairly progressing till date. There had
been enough traffic and a good number of visitors each day. But surely, it
requires a considerable amount of regular investment before a website becomes
self-sufficient and start rolling and reaping benefits on its own.
Due to lack of resources and funds, I am unable to keep the
progress going forward. I have the right kind of skills and knowledge that  are required in order to maintain and develop
a blogging portal but it surely requires more than that.
I am really looking forward to some investors and
contributors who can be a part of this process. You can expect some amazing
perks and offers in return in terms of many services that are listed on my
website. You are going to be a part of it, so rest assured.
You will be granted full access to my domain and you will be
able to experience each and every detail as we progress together. All the funds
will be used entirely in making our portal a better place for the members of
the community that will be visiting it to gain benefits.
A good response is pretty much assured from my website
because it already has a good number of traffic and the main obstacle of
launching it has already been crossed and left behind. My work is already in
existence and i have created a great number of followers and supporters in the
mean time when i had been struggling hard.
The large number of visitors on my website and the followers
on my various social media portals is a clear indicator of the fact that there
should not be any problem in the future. Hence, success and the right kind of
development is very much ensured in the future when we have enough amount of
funds in order to carry the work forward.
The Developing Plan
We currently are in need of funds as there are several
things that need to be taken care of in order to let the development and
progress of the website be done in a periodic way and in an efficient manner.
We have thoroughly investigated the current scenario and have done considerable
amount of research in the market and on the world wide web so that we can
exactly know where we currently stand, what is to be done and what are the
estimated costs, time and deadlines associated with it.
We have allocated and broken down the amount of funds
required in the following sections:
Developmental
Overhaul of the entire structural design and Framework: - $1500
We have realized the need for change. Dynamic nature is
always important because change is the only entity which we are synonymous to.
The templates and the structures of the website will need to
be re-constructed in order to have an enhanced user appeal and more
accessibility by the users. An efficient User Interface and be a major factor
in the long run as it is something that can improve the user experience as it
guides and facilitates the user in reaching out to where they exactly want to.
These changes might seem to be small at first but they
contribute in a big way later on as we will see.
The Design Makeover:
- $1500
The layout and design of a website should be built in such a
way that it pleases to they senses of the audience and they actually enjoying
browsing around on your website. A badly or poorly designed website can be a
huge turn off for the audiences as it shows and conveys a lot about the
dedication that the owner has put into it.
More than half of the work is done if the appearance and
appeal of the website is satisfactory.
The specialized SEO
campaign: - $4000
Every portal requires some means in order to be existent and
findable over the world wide web. The internet is flooding and is full of
websites and resources related to almost every thing that a person can imagine.
So, how does your audience search for something in one of
the search engines and find your links? This is where the Search Engine
Optimization techniques kick in. This is a very vast and complex topic in
itself because usually it is not so simple to attract traffic and audience to
your website.
There are many ways and techniques by the use of which one
can improve the ranks of their websites and we too need to do the same so that
people can reach out to us first instead of wandering somewhere else.
This is a very rigorous process and requires a considerable
amount of time and dedication in order to be successful. Proper kinds of SEO
techniques for a website can be a blessing for the prospects of the website in
the future.
Advertising,
Expansion and Marketing in the Social Media: - $3000
Nowadays, any franchise or brand is incomplete without the
participation of Social Media. Establishments from the biggest to the smallest
always require the support of the Social Media at some point of time.
Social Media is a very crucial part of this long going
ordeal as it is one of the best methods to reach out to the people. The social
media and the social networks are the ultimate pool of traffic. There reside
all the users from different parts of the world. It is only up to us that how
exactly will we be able to let them know about our website.
Advertising is a very important part of any campaign as it
is the only medium by the use of which the audience comes to know about us.
The power of Social Media is so great that it is
unfathomable. It alone can lead a portal to victory with ease.
Expansion leads to the multiplication of processes on the
servers. A larger community means more traffic and more activities which is
very healthy and desirable for every domain.
Every entity and establishment depends largely on the
marketing that has been done for it. Every brand invests a large amount of
funds and efforts in marketing just to get recognition in the market because
this is important.
Hence, the conclusion is that these attributes are very
essential for every website and we too aim to do the same.B L O G M O S T       P E R K S BRONZE SUPPORTER - $5Thank you very much for your Big support on be half of BLOGMOST.We send you a BIG Thank you for the Great support you given for us.

In the kitchen, good cooks prefer carbon steel knives. Carbon blades sharpen much more easily than stainless steel. They take very well to a sharpening stone and will keep a great edge. Give your handcrafted 6 Inch High Carbon Steel Chefs Knife the simple care it deserves and you will be rewarded with a lifetime of service, and a knife that will be in your family for generations.

</h4>
<div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>JCup contains up to 50% more coffee <u>but</u> fits Keurig type brewers</li>
<li>JCup brews an 8-10 oz. mug or cup of fresh, full-bodied joe</li>
<li>JCup is filled-to-order with FIVE STAR rated regular <u>or</u> flavored coffees</li>
<li>JCup is made of 100% commonly recycled #5 polypropylene</li>
</ul>
<p>WATCH THIS:  The uniquely versatile JCup has a <u>self-sealing</u> hinged lid.  This brings a new dimension of convenience to coffee enthusiasts who prefer to use their own coffee.  We offer unfilled iFILL FORMAT cups separately in a 32 pack.  They are easily filled <u>and</u> sealed just before brewing.  NOTE:  See our PERKS for iFILL choices.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434980943/hadybud1slw7vqpvdmnd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

IF you have media contacts, they might be super helpful. We need ""everyone <u>and</u> their brother"" to use Facebook, Linked-in, You-Tube, blog posts and Twitter to propel us into VIRAL MODE!!!</p>

FIVE STAR CONCEPT began when our Founders, Greg and Joy Alford,
developed an appreciation and passion for rich tasting, aromatic coffees when they lived in Seattle.  Over the next fifteen years, they built their knowledge base by attending coffee trade shows, meeting with roasters and actually working in
coffee shops.  Greg is a
self-trained home barista and mixologist who, after years of practice, fulfilled his dream
of making perfect cappuccinos on a daily basis.  This lead to Joy fulfilling her dream of enjoying perfect cappuccinos on a daily basis ... THEY MAKE HER HAPPY!</span>

<p>Greg and Joy’s coffee research adventures clearly indicated that home brewing, coffee enthusiasts were often disappointed with their <u>trial</u> and <u>error</u> selections of expensive coffees when they failed to deliver great taste.  They also learned there are hundreds of coffee roasters in America who don't know beans about roasting truly great tasting coffee.  The challenge was finding the small batch, artisans who had mastered the art of roasting beans that “taste as good as they smell”.  FIVE STAR COFFEE accepted and after eighteen months of due diligence, conquered the challenge.  <i>The wonderful aromas</i> created by our skillfully roasted beans are FREE!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431544281/og7psaswuxcrollzub0u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>OUR small batch, artisan roasters live the <i>art</i> and <i>science</i> of coffee roasting.  They meticulously roast beans to order in small batches of 50-150 pounds. They <u>love</u> what they do ... no detail is too small ... consistency is critical.  Our FIVE STAR roasters buy green beans from specialty coffee importers who cup (taste test) all bean batches before making buying commitments.  FIVE STAR beans are “cupped” at least three times before they are shipped to us.</p>

“high grown” in elevations that are 2000 to 6000 feet above sea level and selected from the
top 10% of all Arabica coffee beans.  Coffee farmers in the major coffee regions
of South America, Central America, East Africa and Indonesia bring multi-generational skills to bear to grow, harvest and process these world class beans.  The farms that produce Specialty Grade beans earn substantially more than those who produce lower rated Premium Grade and Exchange Grade beans.</span><br/>

By selecting one (or more) of our PERKS, coffee enthusiasts will provide the funding we need to purchase automated FILLING EQUIPMENT for JCUPS and complete our factory.  We feel this factory is destined to be the future model for single serve coffees.  It allows us to take the single serve concept to a higher level in terms of coffee flavor and kindness to our planet.




THOSE who help us complete our coffee factory are highly likely to be coffee enthusiasts who appreciate the ""GOOD STUFF"".  OUR PERKS are comprised of world class coffees and brewing accessories.  We humbly feel these are the BEST PERKS since the discovery of coffee in Ethopia (600 AD).  They will appeal to businesses and individuals.  As for coffees, we offer a sophisticated light Peruvian, bold and smooth Indonesian and two delightful flavors (to sip not gulp).  As a special treat, we feature our exotic ""in your dreams"" coffee from the Kona Region of the BIG ISLAND.  Here is the preview list of PERKS (shipping included in prices):

The simplicity and convenience of single serve brewing has created explosive growth for singe cup brewers and K-style cups.  Billions of cups are being sold along with millions of brewers.  However, discriminating coffee enthusiasts say the vast majority of these mass processed coffees fail to deliver on richness and taste. IN ADDITION, the cups aren't recyclable and are receiving considerable negative press.  We had decided to avoid single serve pods, cups and capsules for these reasons. SUDDENLY ... the breakthrough occurred ... we discovered the new JCup design and the equipment to fill them with fresh FIVE STAR COFFEES.  We realized it's time for FIVE STAR to enter the single serve market with a recyclable cup that is bolder, better and fresher!  Here are the JCUP ADVANTAGES:




JCup contains up to 50% more coffee but fits Keurig type brewers
JCup brews an 8-10 oz. mug or cup of fresh, full-bodied joe
JCup is filled-to-order with FIVE STAR rated regular or flavored coffees
JCup is made of 100% commonly recycled #5 polypropylene

WATCH THIS:  The uniquely versatile JCup has a self-sealing hinged lid.  This brings a new dimension of convenience to coffee enthusiasts who prefer to use their own coffee.  We offer unfilled iFILL FORMAT cups separately in a 32 pack.  They are easily filled and sealed just before brewing.  NOTE:  See our PERKS for iFILL choices.







The
FIVE STAR COFFEE FACTORY marks the beginning of the end of mass roasted, mass filled, mass distributed and
mass merchandised single serve cups. Coffee loving home brewers and businesses with single cup brewers will now have a choice of larger capacity, recyclable JCups filled with small batch roasted, fresh coffee!  This is a HUGE advancement!  The newly designed, high efficiency filling equipment for our factory will allow us to provide insanely great tasting single cup coffees.  Hold the bland hot brown liquid please!  No more piles of plastic cups that cannot be
recycled!  WHAT IS NOT TO LIKE?







There are three reasons JCups provide richer taste:  (1) The full-depth filter inside the cups holds up to 15 grams of coffee versus 9-12 grams for other single cups (see diagrams below).  (2) The JCup design prevents ""channeling"" and insures full saturation of the ground coffee occurs. (3) The FIVE STAR COFFEE is much fresher and ""Specialty Grade"" which means it must have character-in-the-cup.







The FIVE STAR COFFEE FACTORY will add single cup filling
equipment to our bagged coffee packaging operation. 
The initial launch will be in the Atlanta metro area to businesses and home brewers but all our coffees can be ordered online and shipped same day to all parts of the USA.  JCups will be filled-to-order with specialty grade coffee.  This brings a freshness
and taste dimension to single serve coffee that has been lacking.  Factories need production equipment and that is the case with our FIVE STAR FACTORY.  For the JCup production line, we want to add two semi-automatic single cup filling machines which can fill 20,000 cups per shift.  Here is the short list of items we need:

Two semi-automatic fill machines (2400 cph)..............$8,800.00
Infusion 200F brewer inventory......................................$3,900.00
Two commercial coffee grinders.................................... $1,850.00
JCup inventory..................................................................$2,000.00
Packaging design and supplies....................................... $1,450.00
Promotion / Printing / Mailing Budget...........................$5,000.00
Website and social media modifications.........................$1,500.00


                                                            TOTAL FUNDING NEED.....$24,250.00





To fund the scaling up of our factory, we have chosen to go with CROWDFUNDING rather than borrowing from banks, family members and friends.  It just seems right that those who have an affinity for great coffee and a healthy planet are the best sources for helping us start what what we are calling the JCUP REVOLUTION.  We desperately need YOU to select a PERK and to spread the GOOD NEWS to fellow coffee enthusiasts ... the K-style monopoly is coming to an end.  Jumbo JCups filled-to-order with fresh coffee will soon be available!  When spreading the word, think family members, neighbors, doctors, lawyers, dentists, business associates, fellow worshippers, club members, alumni pals, fraternity brothers and sisters, et al. IF you have media contacts, they might be super helpful. We need ""everyone and their brother"" to use Facebook, Linked-in, You-Tube, blog posts and Twitter to propel us into VIRAL MODE!!!







Providing coffee enthusiasts exclusive, tightly vetted, Specialty Grade Coffees (defined later) which provide world class taste experiences is the first step toward fulfilling our MISSION.  It is gratifying that our environmentally sensitive coffee farmers, small batch roasters, female coffee farm owners and even migratory birds benefit from the sale of our coffees.  In addition, we actively support the Boy Scouts, The Kiwanis Club, Community Welcome House and many other worthy causes in the Atlanta area.










THE
FIVE STAR CONCEPT began when our Founders, Greg and Joy Alford,
developed an appreciation and passion for rich tasting, aromatic coffees when they lived in Seattle.  Over the next fifteen years, they built their knowledge base by attending coffee trade shows, meeting with roasters and actually working in
coffee shops.  Greg is a
self-trained home barista and mixologist who, after years of practice, fulfilled his dream
of making perfect cappuccinos on a daily basis.  This lead to Joy fulfilling her dream of enjoying perfect cappuccinos on a daily basis ... THEY MAKE HER HAPPY!



   


   






     

Greg and Joy’s coffee research adventures clearly indicated that home brewing, coffee enthusiasts were often disappointed with their trial and error selections of expensive coffees when they failed to deliver great taste.  They also learned there are hundreds of coffee roasters in America who don't know beans about roasting truly great tasting coffee.  The challenge was finding the small batch, artisans who had mastered the art of roasting beans that “taste as good as they smell”.  FIVE STAR COFFEE accepted and after eighteen months of due diligence, conquered the challenge.  The wonderful aromas created by our skillfully roasted beans are FREE!



OUR small batch, artisan roasters live the art and science of coffee roasting.  They meticulously roast beans to order in small batches of 50-150 pounds. They love what they do ... no detail is too small ... consistency is critical.  Our FIVE STAR roasters buy green beans from specialty coffee importers who cup (taste test) all bean batches before making buying commitments.  FIVE STAR beans are “cupped” at least three times before they are shipped to us.






The “Specialty Grade Coffee” designation is hard earned.  It requires ""a rating of 80 points or higher with no defects and distinctive character-in-the-cup"".  This OFFICIAL RATING means
the beans are taste tested and graded by professional cuppers to be the best-of-the-best.  Specialty beans are
“high grown” in elevations that are 2000 to 6000 feet above sea level and selected from the
top 10% of all Arabica coffee beans.  Coffee farmers in the major coffee regions
of South America, Central America, East Africa and Indonesia bring multi-generational skills to bear to grow, harvest and process these world class beans.  The farms that produce Specialty Grade beans earn substantially more than those who produce lower rated Premium Grade and Exchange Grade beans.













Bringing the JCUP to market presents a DAVID and GOLIATH battle ... Challenging market leaders is not for the faint-hearted even when you have superior products and a noble cause.  YOUR SUPPORT is critical to our COFFEE FACTORY.  We are competing with stock exchange listed companies such as Green Mountain and Starbucks as well as the giant mass market purveyors of hot brown liquid such as Folgers, Maxwell House, Chock Full O'Nuts, et al.  WE will fight this battle with an eco-friendly, fresher, bolder, better tasting product and a creative, efficient, integrated marketing program.  While everyone else is zigging, we will be zagging to set FIVE STAR JCUPS apart from the mass processed stuff.





WE are ready to ""CRANK UP THE FACTORY""!  Everything is in place at our Fulfillment Center to add the equipment we need to do it.  All we need is your help and we can order packaging supplies, cups and filling equipment.  Our list of PERKS has world class coffees every business and individual who shares our passion will enjoy.  SELECT A PERK and JOIN OUR JCUP REVOLUTION!

MAY THE FORCE (OF FIVE STAR COFFEE) BE WITH YOU!

This is the main reason why I applied to compete in this National Pageant. There are many other people who struggle with depression, like I did, and many more who will go through it in the future. I thought, if I could just reach one person with my story and help them, this is all worth it. I decided to not let my fear stop me from fighting for my goals. I decided to not be afraid of judgement because if I can be happy with myself and if I can help someone else to find happiness within themselves, then judgement is nothing.</p><p>I have always been a people pleaser. I would say yes to every favour that people asked me for if I thought it would help them. I got heavily involved in high school, in things like student council; and I was accepted as a member of the Minister's Student Advisory Council for the Ministry of Education for Ontario (MSAC), where I represented students from my area at the provincial level to help make school more inclusive and engaging for my fellow students; I started my own SpeakUp Committee to get others involved who were never given the chance to get involved; I joined a committee through United Way, called the Youth Engagement Partnership, to help youth in my community get involved and to encourage Boards and Committees in my community to reach out to youth for their ideas and involvement; and much more.</p><p>It took me too long to figure out that I was not giving enough to myself. I thought, if I focus any attention on myself, that was being selfish. I wore myself out so fast and beat myself up so much for not being good enough. It got to a point where I constantly felt like a disappointment. So any time anyone ever complimented me, I sincerely thanked them, however I felt like I did not deserve it.</p><p>I developed this angry voice in my head, telling me how stupid I was, how pathetic I was, how undeserving I was and so on. This voice tore me down until there was barely any fight left in me. I knew I needed help because when this voice said demeaning things to me, I eventually stopped arguing with it. I started to agree with everything it told me. There was a point where I completely hated myself, but I passed that point. I no longer cared about myself. But luckily, I cared about the ones who love me and I couldn't hurt them so I didn't want to hurt me. I decided to reach out to someone I trusted but someone who had a distant relationship to me. A teacher.</p><p>Fast forward: I was able to overcome my depression. It took over 5 years, but I did it because I never gave up on myself and I tried my hardest. I am still struggling with mental health issues and seeing a psychologist as well as a psychiatrist. I have my bad days just like you, but I have learned how to deal with them and learn from them. It's a process and it will take time, but I am progressing and getting stronger every day.</p><p>I want other girls and women to know that they are beautiful and that they are enough. I don't want anyone to go through what I went through and so I will stand before a huge crowd and judges and look them in the face with confidence and say ""I am beautiful"" and whether they see it or not does not matter to me. What matters is that I feel it and I believe it and it's real. I believe in myself and when I walk off that stage and at the end of the day I will feel so happy and proud of myself. I will be able to say to myself ""look at how far I have come! I did it! I showed myself how beautiful I am!"" and that's enough for me.</p><p>I hope that this helps other women and girls. I hope that I encourage and inspire them to look in the mirror and smile and say ""I am beautiful. I am strong. I am enough."" I hope this helps other women find happiness within themselves. And ladies, we don't have to do this alone. I ask you to join me on my journey so that we can help each other,  inspire each other and encourage each other.</p><p>After the Pageant I want to continue my journey in helping other women and girls find opportunities to do something like this for themselves.

My heart breaks to think what everyone is going through at this moment losing their loved ones, their homes, their city These are very difficult times for Nepal. Also Nepal is one of the least developed countries in the world with a very high poverty rate, They need all the help they can get to overcome this terrible disaster. 

We are NGO's, we are helping people by providing modular housing and trailers. 
After a devastating earthquake the hardest and slowest to recover are 
the affected area's infrastructure and housing conditions. It will take 
years for Nepal to recover from the devastating earthquakes. Our goal is
 to raise $ 500 000, which would be enough to provide 50 houses. Yes, that's 
correct, 50 houses for the many Nepalese families in need.

Our houses are emergency settlement units under ISO 9001 international standards and with superior engineering and quality control system. As Production is modular or trailer, it is done in short time and provides easy transportation as an advantage. Our modular emergency residential units offer ideal solutions for accommodating people who suffered from consequences of unwelcome natural disasters such earthquakes, floods and fires.

Any contributor who pledges $ 10 000 will be granted the opportunity to have 
his or his family's name and home country presented on a housing trailer
 designated to the Nepalese people in need.
Please Donate whatever you can and if you can't even a prayer is very much appreciated.

We have just  finished our latest project of a similar type. We have created a refugee camp for the many Syrian people affected by the terrible war ravaging their home country, who are looking for a better life in Europe. This refugee camp is located in Bulgaria, Europe and is designed to accommodate the many illegal refugees coming from Turkey on their way to Europe.

Decades of enjoying these easy to pick up, but difficult to master games captured my imagination, while creating undeniable impressions
that were the catalyst for myself, my friends, and millions
of others like us to be artists, writers, musicians, programmers,
cosplayers, gamers, and entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>In St. Louis, there are a few private collectors and some local businesses with a couple random games, but no single, large public collection of games available for the public to enjoy everyday.</p><p>We want to change that by creating a place to congregate, socialize,
have a drink, and participate in what is for many thousands, if not
millions, a shared lifelong hobby. St. Louis has some great Pinball

<p>
We
live in a growing and developing city that's getting better everyday.
We not only want to be a part of this growth, we want to help fuel it
by bringing another unique business to the area.</p>
<p>Realizing dreams like this doesn't happen overnight. It takes planning, research, and dedication. For the past several years, we've
been developing, writing, and refining our business plan to realize our goal. Here's what we've been spending our time doing...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Our
Concept</b></h3>
<p>
We
want to bring the Arcade Bar experience to St. Louis. We know
that the concept of arcade
games in a bar isn't anything new, they go together like high cholesterol and heart disease. </p>
<p>It's a pairing that's been done since the early
1980s. We have little control over that fact. However, what we
can control is the experience we provide our customers.
Fundamentally, this begins with our brand.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our
Brand</h3>
<p>
The natural inclination for an Arcade Bar ""brand"" is to go for something pixelated, cold, complex, and niche. However, the objective of our branding was to keep it simple, friendly, playful,
social, approachable, and organic - all the qualities we want our bar to embody. </p>
<p>Chicago
based <a href=""http://www.sofyakarash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sofya
Karash</a> and <a href=""http://cargocollective.com/mcmanus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daniel
McManus</a> at <a href=""http://thisisthenarrative.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Narrative
Branding and Design</a> nailed
it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>                                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439666801/q66c7d7lnmhf3zpnqsvv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 594.844px;height: 563px;""/></p>
<p>Their
research, sketches, concept art (featured above), and incredible talent helped form the visual backbone of our brand, our logo, as well as many of
awesome perks we're offering to backers, such as our T-Shirt, at the
$30 backer level, and the $10 Vinyl Sticker. We hope that you like
what we've developed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The Environment</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
When
you walk in the bar, we want you to feel like you're running into an
old friend that you spent a lot of good times with, but haven't seen
in a while. A playful sense of excitement that you get when you're
a little kid and you know you're about to experience something
enjoyable. </p>
<p>
To
help accomplish this goal, we've been working with our friends work in architecture to help us create a place that is welcoming, efficient, and functional.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A
S.M.A.R.T. Experience</h3>
<p>
Delivering
the experience that will make the business successful means we're
keeping the
everything simple, measurable, achievable, realistic, and
transparent, or S.M.A.R.T.<br/><br/>No food, and no kitchen. We're bartenders that are passionate about video arcade games,
local draft beers, and great cocktails. </p>
<p>We're friendly, seasoned bar
staff creating a distinct environment and welcoming experience that
everyone, regardless of who you are or how passionate you are about video games. </p>
<p>
""But,""
you say.....</p>
<p>
<b>""I'm
not really a hardcore gamer.""</b><br/>We
understand, most people aren't. Many of our closest friends and
family members love the arcade bar experience, but don't necessarily
have hours to invest in setting high scores or being at the top of a
leader board. They have full-time jobs, families, girlfriends,
boyfriends, dogs, and <a href=""http://strangedonuts.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Strange
Donuts</a> to
buy. </p>
<p>Here are some features we're planning for this
crowd:</p>

	lot.</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">""Hey!
But I am a hardcore gamer! What about me???""</b><br/>Easy cowboy!
We didn't forget about you. For the more hardcore or veteran audience, we are
planning the following features that you will enjoy: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Regular
	Prize Tournaments</p>
</li>
<li>

	Persistent On-Line and In-Store Leader Board Positions</p>

	Opportunities
	for Setting Records. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Streaming
	your Gameplay via Twitch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We
anticipate many people want this depth of experience right from the
start, or as they become better at the games. We're more than happy
to make this a reality.</p>
<p><b>""Buddy! I'm hungry, but you don't have any food!""</b><br/>Breaker ten-four loud and clear, we're on the side, pardner! Feel free to order in or bring anything you want to eat. No smokey bears are gonna put the brakes on ya.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Barchievements</h3>
<p>We all know that there are a lot of loyalty programs out there that only encourage you to just ""buy more of what we're selling"". </p>
<p>While our ""Barchievment"" program does encourage purchases for certain Barchievements, we think of it as a ""meta game"" for the bar that will enable you to earn different custom iron-on patches designed by local artist, Alex Fortune.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
Giving Back to Our Community</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""Quarters for Quarters""</h3>
<p>
While
being profitable is a perfectly fine goal (Hell, we want to and need
to be profitable!), it's also important to be part of the
community and support causes that are dear to our customers, team
members, neighbors, and partners. </p>
<p>
To
accomplish this goal, various games throughout each financial quarter
will be designated as ""Charity Games"". This means for one financial quarter these games will cost twenty-five cents to play.</p>
<p>When the quarter ends, we will add this money up, and ask our customers will vote
via social media on which not-for-profit organization will receive
the funds accumulated in this manner. </p>
<p>
Other
options that we're considering using this program for is to help
other Indiegogo campaigns fund their dreams. What better way to give
back to the community that helped us when we needed a boost. </p>

<div>
<p>Our
passion for this project has enabled us to climb the mountain, but we
need your help to reach the summit. <br/><br/>While we have an
ambitious target of $36,000.00 it is an achievable and realistic goal
given the scope of the project. The total opening costs actually come
to +$65,000 which is mostly inventory, games, equipment, lease,
and other expenses associated with opening a bar.  
</p>
<br/>
</div>

<p>The
start-up costs for this venture are being financed partially through
my own personal and retirement savings; partially by this campaign;
and up to 2 private investors. </p>
<p>One investor has already committed to ~$30,000 which will accompany whatever we are able to raise, via this
campaign, as well as additional contingency funds as may be
required. </p>
<p>
We
are purchasing a majority of the assets, however, there will also be
some equipment that will be rented; leased; and loaned. There are
consultants that will need to be hired, some will be volunteers; some
maintained for a time on contract; and some more permanently. We
will also need cash to finance operations. </p>
<p>
<b>This
is the break down of what the money will be used for:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Indiegogo
	fees - <b>$1,750.00</b></p>
</li>
<li><p>Pay Pal Fees - <b>$1,050.00</b></p></li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>We have been working on this project night and day for the past 3 years, and the simple truth is, without you, we can't make it a reality. </p>
<p>Your generosity, literally (very literally), determines whether or not we realize our dream of opening up Arcade Bar and owning our own business, or returning to focus on a more traditional career path. </p>
<p>While we've passionately poured hundreds, if not thousands, of hours worth of sweat equity into the business, passion and sweat equity aren't accepted as payment for walk in coolers, kegs of beer, or arcade games.</p>
<p>Please back us, and if you can, generously! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Only
your generosity can enable us to realize Arcade Bar. Help make our dream
come true, and help make the universe a happier place. </b>
</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The
Risks</b></h3>Like anything in life, (for instance, posting a picture of yourself as a child, in a Speedo) there are risks. We understand this, and are confident in our planning. </div>
<div>By identifying and weighing the major
risks to the business, and discussing the affect(s) they would have, as
well as ways to minimize &amp; mitigate them, we feel confident in our planning. </div>
<div>If things really start to go tits up, we also have a network of friends that own restaurants and bars that we can ask for guidance.</div>
<div>
<p>
 If
you have a question about a risk that you're concerned about, please
reach out, and we will address it in our Frequently Asked Questions
on our website, ASAP.

campaigns should be expected to communicate road blocks and failures
when they occur.</span>

<div>
<b style=""font-size: 36px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;""></b><p><b>How can I help make this bar happen?</b><br/>We've passionately poured hundreds, if not thousands, of hours worth of sweat equity into the business, passion but sweat equity does not pay for walk in coolers,kegs of beer, or arcade games, so please back us, and if you can, generously.<br/></p>
<p><b>Why did you choose flexible funding?</b><br/>We choose flexible funding so that the money could be deposited into the Arcade Bar business bank account. This is not an option for fixed funding. We did not want to be personally liable for the taxes we would have to pay on money raised.</p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>Is Arcade Bar St. Louis even a Business? </b></p>
<p>Yes! We are an L.L.C. registered with the State of Missouri.</p>
<p><b>Will the money that I give to back this project go to a personal bank account?</b><br/>No. All money will go to a business bank account for the bar.</p>
<p><b>Why are you doing this? </b><br/>Why not? It's our dream. In a universe where (as far as we know) we only get one go round, there's no fucking reason not to try and achieve every dream that we have. Moreover, if we don't do it, someone else will.</p>
<p><b>Where are you going to be located?</b><br/>We're planning to open up in St. Louis city. We don't want to announce a location and have to retract our announcement because of problems with obtaining a liquor license or because of unknown issues with a property. Once we're certain we're able to open in a space, we'll make an announcement. Until then, send us your suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don't reach your goal?<br/></strong>We may not reach our goal, but when we move onto the next thing, we can do so knowing that we did everything possible to make this bar a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your investor and why isn't he listed anywhere?<br/></strong>The 1 investor in this bar is a  personal friend that we have known since High School. He requested to be a silent investor/partner in the project, and as such, we're respecting his wishes to remain anonymous.</p>
<p><b>You know this is a risk, right?</b><br/>Yup. Like anything in life, there are risks. We understand this, and are confident in our planning. We've identified and weighed the major risks to the business and discussed the affect(s) they would have, as well as ways to minimize &amp; mitigate them. </p>
<p><b>If I support this project, how do I know you're not just going to run off with my money?</b><br/>Simply put, you don't. However, by taking your money and not delivering on our promises  we would be alienating not only you, but our friends, family, and the goodwill of everyone that has helped get us to this point.  We'd also be throwing away literally thousands of dollars that we have already invested in bringing this project to fruition. Would that be worth it? No. We don't think so.</p>
<p><b>Can I be the first ""Quarters for Quarters"" recipient?</b><br/>We can't guarantee, but we welcome you apply.</p>
<p><strong>Can I put my game in your bar?<br/></strong>Sure! Let's figure out how we can make sure we develop a ""win/win"" opportunity.</p>
<p><b>How are you going to make money?</b><br/>No food. No kitchen. Just by doing what we're passionate about: video arcade games, booze, and friendly, seasoned bar staff creating a distinct environment and welcoming experience that everyone, regardless of who you are or how familiar with video games you are, can enjoy.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","While
we've done many things, lived many places, and had many loves in our
lives the constant through it all has been a love of video games.
We've
come a long way, and a lot has changed since I was a boy playing Ms.
Pacman, Donkey Kong, Frogger, Dig Dug and other iconic arcade titles
on the New Jersey boardwalk.                                            YES! This is totally me in the pictures.
Decades of enjoying these easy to pick up, but difficult to master games captured my imagination, while creating undeniable impressions
that were the catalyst for myself, my friends, and millions
of others like us to be artists, writers, musicians, programmers,
cosplayers, gamers, and entrepreneurs. 
In St. Louis, there are a few private collectors and some local businesses with a couple random games, but no single, large public collection of games available for the public to enjoy everyday.We want to change that by creating a place to congregate, socialize,
have a drink, and participate in what is for many thousands, if not
millions, a shared lifelong hobby. St. Louis has some great Pinball
Bars that we love, but no video arcade bars.

Help
us Open St. Louis' First and Only Arcade Bar

St.
Louis, Missouri is literally surrounded by cities with arcade
bars. For example.....
Chicago
has five...


                                 
                                                    Kansas City has two......
                                 
                                                  Des Moines has one........

                                
                                        Springfield, Missouri even has one! 

                                 

                                                     St.
Louis has none! 

                                                   


We
live in a growing and developing city that's getting better everyday.
We not only want to be a part of this growth, we want to help fuel it
by bringing another unique business to the area.
Realizing dreams like this doesn't happen overnight. It takes planning, research, and dedication. For the past several years, we've
been developing, writing, and refining our business plan to realize our goal. Here's what we've been spending our time doing...






Our
Concept

We
want to bring the Arcade Bar experience to St. Louis. We know
that the concept of arcade
games in a bar isn't anything new, they go together like high cholesterol and heart disease. 
It's a pairing that's been done since the early
1980s. We have little control over that fact. However, what we
can control is the experience we provide our customers.
Fundamentally, this begins with our brand.


Our
Brand

The natural inclination for an Arcade Bar ""brand"" is to go for something pixelated, cold, complex, and niche. However, the objective of our branding was to keep it simple, friendly, playful,
social, approachable, and organic - all the qualities we want our bar to embody. 
Chicago
based Sofya
Karash and Daniel
McManus at Narrative
Branding and Design nailed
it. 

                                         
Their
research, sketches, concept art (featured above), and incredible talent helped form the visual backbone of our brand, our logo, as well as many of
awesome perks we're offering to backers, such as our T-Shirt, at the
$30 backer level, and the $10 Vinyl Sticker. We hope that you like
what we've developed.

The Environment


When
you walk in the bar, we want you to feel like you're running into an
old friend that you spent a lot of good times with, but haven't seen
in a while. A playful sense of excitement that you get when you're
a little kid and you know you're about to experience something
enjoyable. 

To
help accomplish this goal, we've been working with our friends work in architecture to help us create a place that is welcoming, efficient, and functional.


A
S.M.A.R.T. Experience

Delivering
the experience that will make the business successful means we're
keeping the
everything simple, measurable, achievable, realistic, and
transparent, or S.M.A.R.T.No food, and no kitchen. We're bartenders that are passionate about video arcade games,
local draft beers, and great cocktails. 
We're friendly, seasoned bar
staff creating a distinct environment and welcoming experience that
everyone, regardless of who you are or how passionate you are about video games. 

""But,""
you say.....

""I'm
not really a hardcore gamer.""We
understand, most people aren't. Many of our closest friends and
family members love the arcade bar experience, but don't necessarily
have hours to invest in setting high scores or being at the top of a
leader board. They have full-time jobs, families, girlfriends,
boyfriends, dogs, and Strange
Donuts to
buy. 
Here are some features we're planning for this
crowd:



	TVs
	playing sports; movies; & classic WWE(F), or a combination of the
	lot.



	Our ""Barchievement"" Loyalty Program (more on that, in a minute...).



	A
	recreational gaming league.





""Hey!
But I am a hardcore gamer! What about me???""Easy cowboy!
We didn't forget about you. For the more hardcore or veteran audience, we are
planning the following features that you will enjoy: 



	Regular
	Prize Tournaments



	Persistent On-Line and In-Store Leader Board Positions



	A
	Competitive Gaming League.



	Opportunities
	for Setting Records. 



	Streaming
	your Gameplay via Twitch.



We
anticipate many people want this depth of experience right from the
start, or as they become better at the games. We're more than happy
to make this a reality.
""Buddy! I'm hungry, but you don't have any food!""Breaker ten-four loud and clear, we're on the side, pardner! Feel free to order in or bring anything you want to eat. No smokey bears are gonna put the brakes on ya.


""How
much them vidya games gonna cost us???""Oh.
We didn't mention? Everything we own is going to be a on
free-play. Everyone loves that! 


Barchievements
We all know that there are a lot of loyalty programs out there that only encourage you to just ""buy more of what we're selling"". 
While our ""Barchievment"" program does encourage purchases for certain Barchievements, we think of it as a ""meta game"" for the bar that will enable you to earn different custom iron-on patches designed by local artist, Alex Fortune.



                                          *One Sample of Planned Holiday Barchievements*


Completing
these different, fun challenges related to things like holidays, the
bar experience, arcade games, and our local community can also earn
you merchandise such as hats, hoodies, and pint glasses.


If you decide to contribute at the $20 level you will be enrolled in the program at a discount, and earn the Indiegogo exclusive backer stamp, and a 1-time only patch that can never be earned again


Giving Back to Our Community
""Quarters for Quarters""

While
being profitable is a perfectly fine goal (Hell, we want to and need
to be profitable!), it's also important to be part of the
community and support causes that are dear to our customers, team
members, neighbors, and partners. 

To
accomplish this goal, various games throughout each financial quarter
will be designated as ""Charity Games"". This means for one financial quarter these games will cost twenty-five cents to play.
When the quarter ends, we will add this money up, and ask our customers will vote
via social media on which not-for-profit organization will receive
the funds accumulated in this manner. 

Other
options that we're considering using this program for is to help
other Indiegogo campaigns fund their dreams. What better way to give
back to the community that helped us when we needed a boost. 

Speaking
of which......












What We Need

Our
passion for this project has enabled us to climb the mountain, but we
need your help to reach the summit. While we have an
ambitious target of $36,000.00 it is an achievable and realistic goal
given the scope of the project. The total opening costs actually come
to +$65,000 which is mostly inventory, games, equipment, lease,
and other expenses associated with opening a bar.  





The
start-up costs for this venture are being financed partially through
my own personal and retirement savings; partially by this campaign;
and up to 2 private investors. 
One investor has already committed to ~$30,000 which will accompany whatever we are able to raise, via this
campaign, as well as additional contingency funds as may be
required. 

We
are purchasing a majority of the assets, however, there will also be
some equipment that will be rented; leased; and loaned. There are
consultants that will need to be hired, some will be volunteers; some
maintained for a time on contract; and some more permanently. We
will also need cash to finance operations. 

This
is the break down of what the money will be used for:



	Indiegogo
	fees - $1,750.00

Pay Pal Fees - $1,050.00


	Fulfilling
	Perks - $2,000.00



	Opening
	Inventory - $6,000.00



	Glassware
	- $400.00



	Barware
	- $31.00



	Furniture,  Fixtures, & Decor - $3,000.00



	Arcade
	Games - $20,000.00



	Rent
	- $2,000.00



This
totals to just over $36,000.00 ($36,231.00).

What You Get - Perks & Rewards



We
did our best to design our perks to cater to locals backers, as well
as for those of you who are out of town, and just want some sweet
loot, or recognition.  

Once
funding is complete, we will be contacting you for your mailing
address, or you can simply pick everything up Arcade Bar, if that's
an easier option for you.

We
are also sectioning off a large piece of the wall space in the bar to put
the Name, Screen Name, or Company Name for every contributor to be featured.




If
you are unclear about any of the perks, or you have any questions about them, please reach out and
we'll add them to the Frequently Asked Questions section of our website.

The Impact
We have been working on this project night and day for the past 3 years, and the simple truth is, without you, we can't make it a reality. 
Your generosity, literally (very literally), determines whether or not we realize our dream of opening up Arcade Bar and owning our own business, or returning to focus on a more traditional career path. 
While we've passionately poured hundreds, if not thousands, of hours worth of sweat equity into the business, passion and sweat equity aren't accepted as payment for walk in coolers, kegs of beer, or arcade games.
Please back us, and if you can, generously! 

Only
your generosity can enable us to realize Arcade Bar. Help make our dream
come true, and help make the universe a happier place. 


The
RisksLike anything in life, (for instance, posting a picture of yourself as a child, in a Speedo) there are risks. We understand this, and are confident in our planning. 
By identifying and weighing the major
risks to the business, and discussing the affect(s) they would have, as
well as ways to minimize & mitigate them, we feel confident in our planning. 
If things really start to go tits up, we also have a network of friends that own restaurants and bars that we can ask for guidance.


 If
you have a question about a risk that you're concerned about, please
reach out, and we will address it in our Frequently Asked Questions
on our website, ASAP. 


Major Targets and Achievement Dates

There are
lots of targets for this project, and we'll try our best to stick
to the targeted achievement dates we have set. We will communicate to backers our
successes, as well as when, and if, setbacks occur.




Progress Reporting and TransparencyBusinesses operating as a result of crowd source funding have an obligation to produce regular
reports to its backers.  We will be providing progress on rewards, and details
with respect to project milestones, and spend. Additionally,
campaigns should be expected to communicate road blocks and failures
when they occur.



Progress
reports will be provided on a weekly or more basis. The reports will
include details of activities against our set milestones, staff hired,
targets achieved, rewards shipped, and spend.

people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Here are a few very low involvement ways you can help a fellow human, and give us a hand.

FAQ

How can I help make this bar happen?We've passionately poured hundreds, if not thousands, of hours worth of sweat equity into the business, passion but sweat equity does not pay for walk in coolers,kegs of beer, or arcade games, so please back us, and if you can, generously.
Why did you choose flexible funding?We choose flexible funding so that the money could be deposited into the Arcade Bar business bank account. This is not an option for fixed funding. We did not want to be personally liable for the taxes we would have to pay on money raised.
Is Arcade Bar St. Louis even a Business? 
Yes! We are an L.L.C. registered with the State of Missouri.
Will the money that I give to back this project go to a personal bank account?No. All money will go to a business bank account for the bar.
Why are you doing this? Why not? It's our dream. In a universe where (as far as we know) we only get one go round, there's no fucking reason not to try and achieve every dream that we have. Moreover, if we don't do it, someone else will.
Where are you going to be located?We're planning to open up in St. Louis city. We don't want to announce a location and have to retract our announcement because of problems with obtaining a liquor license or because of unknown issues with a property. Once we're certain we're able to open in a space, we'll make an announcement. Until then, send us your suggestions.
What if you don't reach your goal?We may not reach our goal, but when we move onto the next thing, we can do so knowing that we did everything possible to make this bar a reality.
Who is your investor and why isn't he listed anywhere?The 1 investor in this bar is a  personal friend that we have known since High School. He requested to be a silent investor/partner in the project, and as such, we're respecting his wishes to remain anonymous.
You know this is a risk, right?Yup. Like anything in life, there are risks. We understand this, and are confident in our planning. We've identified and weighed the major risks to the business and discussed the affect(s) they would have, as well as ways to minimize & mitigate them. 
If I support this project, how do I know you're not just going to run off with my money?Simply put, you don't. However, by taking your money and not delivering on our promises  we would be alienating not only you, but our friends, family, and the goodwill of everyone that has helped get us to this point.  We'd also be throwing away literally thousands of dollars that we have already invested in bringing this project to fruition. Would that be worth it? No. We don't think so.
Can I be the first ""Quarters for Quarters"" recipient?We can't guarantee, but we welcome you apply.
Can I put my game in your bar?Sure! Let's figure out how we can make sure we develop a ""win/win"" opportunity.
How are you going to make money?No food. No kitchen. Just by doing what we're passionate about: video arcade games, booze, and friendly, seasoned bar staff creating a distinct environment and welcoming experience that everyone, regardless of who you are or how familiar with video games you are, can enjoy.

Hi Folks! 

Although organic products have the lowest hazard rating in terms of health and environmental safety, the importance of consuming them is still a foreign idea in South America. I think I can help to spread a healthier life style in the region by facilitating the access to organic products, starting with Chile. To do so, I am attempting to raise money to begin an organic product business.




                                                           


Where are my manners? First, let me introduce myself. My name is Santiago, I am a human rights lawyer who is starting over after living in Australia with my family for the last five years. We moved abroad thanks to a scholarship that allowed my wife Cristina to undertake her studies at Melbourne Uni.

I really got inspired by the quality and variety of the organic products available in Australia, and I can say from my personal experience that those products made my life and my kids’ lives healthier (as you can see in the picture, we are a big happy family!).




Returning to Chile in the beginning of 2015, my wife and I decided we had to share with others this amazing new life style and follow our passion for sustainable and organic products. We decided the best way to do so was to introduce some of our personal favourite organic sustainable brands into the Chilean market. There is a lack of options in terms of organic products in Chile, which gives us the opportunity to create a leading brand in the market. Hence, we have created our own brand called Ola Orgánica (Organic Wave) http://www.olaorganica.com/ 







We chose this name not only because I´m a surfer at heart, but also because we believe that this amazing organic wave has to ‘be caught’ by all and not be limited to developed countries. 

Why we need more funds...
 To start our business, we are counting on some savings and family money, but it is not enough! We tried to apply for a bank loan to make up the difference. But as we are just back in Chile, the Chilean bank declined the loan on the basis that since there is no track of our activities for the last five years we don´t have the ‘right profile’ to get it. Friends encouraged and advised us to give fundraising a go, in order to avoid the bank manager (at least in this beginning!) and get the community involved with the project… so here we are!
 What we'll be spending the money on...
With the money we raise we will get accounting and tax advice, as well as commercial service. We will also pay for some business registers, specifically public health service certificates, because the first products we will be importing are for children under 6 years old.  
 Being transparent...
Despite our experience with business not being vast, we guarantee all of you who is willing to support us that we are truly motivated and we think we can make some difference. Our goal is simply to change the world by inspiring people with more conscious products and lifestyle choices.  As said, there is much less awareness in South American countries about the importance of consuming products that have the lowest hazard rating in terms of health and environmental safety, and as a result there are fewer products available to people who want to make better choices.

<h3>ABOUT THE BUSINESS</h3>
<h3>Why ASSISTANCE service?</h3>
<div>Her business is based on following philosophy:</div>
<div>"" NO ONE CAN DO EVERYTHING</div>
<div>NO ONE CAN SUCCEED ALONE""</div>
<div>A person has a business idea but does not know where to start may need assistance to register a company, to know what kind of papers to prepare and which office/department to file the application for patents, permits or tax, etc. </div>
<div>An entrepreneur who wants to find a partner/seller/buyer/funder but having language barrier may need assistance to search, identify, approach, contact and at least arrange a meeting with an appropriate person. When the meeting is set, he/she may also need someone's assistance at the meeting to facilitate communication between them.</div>
<div>A company may want to open an office and need assistance in office setup and/or initial recruitment.</div>
<div>An NGO may want assistance to run one of their international volunteer campaigns in Vietnam since it cannot do it itself due to not understanding local society and networks.</div>
<div>A family relocates to Hanoi and needs assistance in housing, schooling and local culture training for its members.</div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i><b>Everyone will need someone's else assistance at some point, especially those who first come to Vietnam where they will find everything so different from home. Sevencoloriris Inc. plays the role which helps them adapt easier and faster to the new living, working and business environment. </b></i></span></div>

</div>
<div>Sevencoloriris Inc. differentiates its service from consultant service although some of its minors may share some similarity.</div>
<div>Assistance service, is believed, is to conduct specific tasks upon requests. Those who know what they want but cannot do it alone (or all by themselves) are subject of assistance service. On the other hand, consultant service is more about theoretical advising rather practical action. <b>Sevencoloriris Inc.</b> does provide advice, but it is just complementary part. Its main service body relies on task implementation.</div>

</div>
<div>
<h3>1. PA/EA COACHING PROGRAM</h3>
<div>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1247212/files/20150224214017-Coach_mentor-logo6.png?1424842817"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Sevencoloriris Coach|Mentor</b> is career counseling program for PA (Personal Assistant) and
EA (Executive Assistant) in Vietnam. Thuy realized that PA and EA, as jobs, require
unique skill set and knowledge; to master these positions, a person needs to
invest time and constant effort in both formal education and self-training at
significant level. However, due to the misconception of society regarding to
Assistant, the role and importance of this job have been, somehow,
underestimated. Therefore, people who are working at these positions sometimes
feel the lack of support or of the resources for their career development. </p>Noticed
this demand, Sevencoloriris Inc. plans to organize micro-classes and mentoring
sessions where Thuy will shed light on all the myths of <b>“To-be-an-Assistant”</b>; where problems are heard and resolved; and where
Assistants will find their spirit and concerns are all shared by others. The
program is conducted at Sevencoloriris Inc. office once a week with 5 sessions
per program. Each person will be automatically enrolled to three free counselling sessions with Thuy - an experienced EA, after the class.<br/>

ABOUT THE ENTREPRENEUR 
"" To be an entrepreneur, a person needs courage. If you are a woman, you need it double"".  
Vu Dieu Thuy, a Vietnamese woman, started her business when she was 27. Thuy is an independent and ambitious young lady, things make her different from other women from where she comes from.

Thuy started a company called ""Sevencoloriris Inc"" to provide ASSISTANCE  to business people and organizations in Vietnam - the first of this kind in the country.   http://www.vietnam-assistance.com/ 



Although born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam, Thuy has experienced different aspects of her life and career in different places around the world. Her vision is broad and her mind is open. Thuy has proved to all of her clients and colleagues with whom she has cooperated that her professionalism and excellent assistance skills are her most outstanding strengths. 






Having worked as an assistant for years, notably as Executive Assistant to CEOs, Thuy understands what makes a good assistant and how an assistant contributes to and enhances a leader’s success. This is the core difference between her business concept of Assist Pro and other forms of professional services available in Vietnam today. Thuy believes that multidisciplinary knowledge, cross-cultural sensitivity and a supportive nature are the key elements enabling Sevencoloriris Inc. to deliver the best value to its customers.



ABOUT THE BUSINESS
Why ASSISTANCE service?
Her business is based on following philosophy:
"" NO ONE CAN DO EVERYTHING
NO ONE CAN SUCCEED ALONE""
A person has a business idea but does not know where to start may need assistance to register a company, to know what kind of papers to prepare and which office/department to file the application for patents, permits or tax, etc. 
An entrepreneur who wants to find a partner/seller/buyer/funder but having language barrier may need assistance to search, identify, approach, contact and at least arrange a meeting with an appropriate person. When the meeting is set, he/she may also need someone's assistance at the meeting to facilitate communication between them.
A company may want to open an office and need assistance in office setup and/or initial recruitment.
An NGO may want assistance to run one of their international volunteer campaigns in Vietnam since it cannot do it itself due to not understanding local society and networks.
A family relocates to Hanoi and needs assistance in housing, schooling and local culture training for its members.
Everyone will need someone's else assistance at some point, especially those who first come to Vietnam where they will find everything so different from home. Sevencoloriris Inc. plays the role which helps them adapt easier and faster to the new living, working and business environment. 


Assistant Vs. Consultant

Sevencoloriris Inc. differentiates its service from consultant service although some of its minors may share some similarity.
Assistance service, is believed, is to conduct specific tasks upon requests. Those who know what they want but cannot do it alone (or all by themselves) are subject of assistance service. On the other hand, consultant service is more about theoretical advising rather practical action. Sevencoloriris Inc. does provide advice, but it is just complementary part. Its main service body relies on task implementation.
"" Our mission is to be an reliable executive assistant for individuals and organizations that need our support in running their business, networking, representing themselves to partners and preparing for relocation to Vietnam"" - Sevencoloriris Inc.


2014 Business Milestones2014 has been a great year to Sevencoloriris Inc. and members. Starting from a small but young and dynamic team, we are so proud
of what we have been through in the passing year which made us grow day by day.


January, 
Sevencoloriris Inc. was officially
registered.
February, 
Latinomics, an International NGO
based in Mexico and Austria, asked for assistance to bring one of its international programs to Vietnam. The tasks: Searched, identified, contacted and represented Latinomisc at meetings with local NGOs to establish partnership for Future Makers program.
April, 

Sevencoloriris
Inc. welcomed World Wings Aviation to Vietnam with the mission to connect with different
Airlines in Vietnam for pilot recruitment. 


August

Started helping Tienli
Limited from Hong Kong and help it search, communicate and facilitate with its
Vietnamese partners who are interested in distributing high-ended European products
such as infant foods, dairy products and others.

OctoberStarted assisting Pfungstädter Brewery from Germany search and select exclusive importer/distributor for its high quality and
large-ranged products in Vietnam.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2015 plan - PROJECTS CALLING FOR FUNDINGIn 2015, Thuy and Sevencoloriris Inc. team will started two new projects relating to Education/Training.


1. PA/EA COACHING PROGRAM




Sevencoloriris Coach|Mentor is career counseling program for PA (Personal Assistant) and
EA (Executive Assistant) in Vietnam. Thuy realized that PA and EA, as jobs, require
unique skill set and knowledge; to master these positions, a person needs to
invest time and constant effort in both formal education and self-training at
significant level. However, due to the misconception of society regarding to
Assistant, the role and importance of this job have been, somehow,
underestimated. Therefore, people who are working at these positions sometimes
feel the lack of support or of the resources for their career development. Noticed
this demand, Sevencoloriris Inc. plans to organize micro-classes and mentoring
sessions where Thuy will shed light on all the myths of “To-be-an-Assistant”; where problems are heard and resolved; and where
Assistants will find their spirit and concerns are all shared by others. The
program is conducted at Sevencoloriris Inc. office once a week with 5 sessions
per program. Each person will be automatically enrolled to three free counselling sessions with Thuy - an experienced EA, after the class.

<br/> <p>As you sit and listen to those who commit hate crimes, self-infliction and much more, you can begin to understand how so many people act out their situations through their economic misunderstandings and lack of resources. </p>
<p>As the economy goes down, discrimination and crime rises. Since, most don't understand how the economy falls, they begin to find reasons to hate or cause conflict, and when they begin to speak, most speak violently, but if you listen closely you can see that they really are crying for help.

We've witnessed people trying their best to create a job, or get a job, only to be turned away, and from this, came an economic crisis for many and some of them committed crimes or other vices, in order to provide for themselves and their families. This has brought a heavy burden on our hearts and for the longest, we'd wonder, What could improve this situation?
Through our research, we've found out that there is at least one thing that we can do; that WE all can do, in order to create a better tomorrow for us and our children and the generation after them. And that is the Unity Center.  This center will help men and women not only get jobs but to create their own jobs. We will also promote cultural unity, unlike most places, where you would have to pay for these services. All of our services will be offered as free.  We will offer free classes, food, clothing and ways to bring about a better YOU. ♥
If you can help us create this Unity Center, I can guarantee, that little by little, we'll make a difference and help bring about a better tomorrow. 
With the Unity Center, we will try to bring unity within different communities, in hopes to get rid of racism and discrimination. No longer should our children hate themselves because of their beliefs, creeds, nor should they suffer mentally, physically or emotionally, just because they may be just different. 



Digital wallpaper, web credits, digital certificates, company t-shirts, posters, sticker, wristbands, live video updates, swag bags, 4 VIP webinars, VIP publicity and acknowledgement, Limited edition printed phone case with 3D-logo of our company, your name (or a friend or loved one's name) on the wall of the building and gratitude plaque, premier VIP seats during opening ceremony, custom jackets and caps with our logo and name, largest logo placement, recognition at the conference and VIP dinner! 

   
The Unity Center will offer several programs, such as:



Food Pantry and Clothing Giveaway: The clothing giveaway will be for both business and casual wear. This means giving out suits and outfits so that when you go to your job interview, you can look the best that you can be! We'll be offering job creation and assistance programs. Job assistance programs will be classes set-up to teach you how to keep your composure during a business interview, and to ensure your safe trip to and from the interviews. Job creation programs are there to help you to learn what business documents to include in order to lift your own business off the ground and to assist and help your business be the best that it could be. 


A walk-in freezer: So that any food in the food pantry will stay nice and fresh until you are able to take it home.




Laundry Room: This way, we can make sure that any clothing we give away is thoroughly cleaned. 







Library/PC Lab:  So that you can be able to research any and all info you want, for the support you need!


Store: This item is the last, but most important of them all. The reason behind the store is that so we can become self-sufficient and be able to offer the above items and services completely free of charge, whatsoever.





 The second thing we will use the money for is renovation of the building, that will meet safety requirements to ensure a nice and soothing environment for all to enjoy. 




A walk-in freezer: So that any food in the food pantry will stay nice and fresh until you are able to take it home. 
 office furnishings for the whole entire building. 

Research materials: (i.e. paper, books, etc.) that we will give out, so that you can create your own business, land a job and for our many class room items

A bus: To safely transport people to job interviews, field trips, etc.

The library and PC Lab: So that you can be able to research any and all info you want, for the support you need!

The store: This item is the last, but most important of them all. The reason behind the store is that so we can become self-sufficient and be able to offer the above items and services completely free of charge, whatsoever. 





   

 As you sit and listen to those who commit hate crimes, self-infliction and much more, you can begin to understand how so many people act out their situations through their economic misunderstandings and lack of resources. 
As the economy goes down, discrimination and crime rises. Since, most don't understand how the economy falls, they begin to find reasons to hate or cause conflict, and when they begin to speak, most speak violently, but if you listen closely you can see that they really are crying for help. Not only that, due to miseducation and very little knowledge of other cultures, we fight amongst ourselves. That's why, we, at 5th Wind Nation feel that creating a Unity Center that provides educational and fundamental value to all walks of life, we believe this will unify and lower crime rates and depression. 
   Risks & Challenges  As far as we know, there has not been another organization who has attempted to accomplish our goals on this scale, because of that some of the risks are unknown. 
There has been a few companies that have attempted to do parts of what we're doing and from that we realize what risks may come.  For one, when dealing with food pantries, sometimes the food can spoil extremely fast or be unfit for human consumption. We plan to meet this challenge by having a walk-in freezer unit.
This would allow us to properly store the food in a way so that it would not be ruined before giving it out to the public.

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Project Summary</b></p>
<p>The plan over the next 12 months is to deliver FREE CrossFit courses to 80 of the most vulnerable people in the Wirral area of the UK. 

Not only are we using CrossFit, we're also delivering: mindfulness meditation sessions, to help people cope better with stress; employability training, to increase confidence in entering the job market; community action projects, such as pallet-furniture building for local social housing residents; voluntary  placements, to encourage local people to connect with their local community; and peer mentoring, to encourage and support people make it the end of the programme. All of this is as a way of helping to influence the lives of local people struggling with mental health issues, drug problems, homelessness, unemployment, social isolation and at-risk young people. </p>
<p>We need to generate enough funding to get the project running for the first year, after which we plan to approach local councils with our evidence and look for investors. 

My community is in the 3% most deprived communities in the entire UK. And we have some of the lowest life-expectancy rates for men nationally. Something really does need to change. </p>
<p> If we could encourage just 4 people from every box worldwide to donate £1 each, we would have more than enough money to get started on the project. 
<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">If you've ever done CrossFit, just quickly ask yourself the
following questions:</b><br/></p>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Has CrossFit changed your life in any way?</span><br/>
</div>
<p>Has it made you a stronger person? Both physically
and mentally?</p>
<p>Has it helped you overcome any difficulties in your
life?</p>
<p>Has it changed your perception of yourself in any
way?</p>
<p>Have you forged new friendships with people you are
likely to be friends with for a very long time? </p>
<p>Do you feel apart of something exciting? </p>
<p>Do you finally feel accepted and a part of a
community?</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I've
asked these same questions to so many people in the last year or two, and nearly
everyone has responded with an incredibly touching and inspirational
story. </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>It was
these stories that gave me hope. Hope that positive change, on a mass-scale, is
possible. If those same stories that I hear are coming out of each and every
one of the 10, 000 CrossFit gyms worldwide, then change on a mass-scale IS possible. </span></p>
<p>But my
question then was this: if CrossFit can facilitate so much change in the world
and impact so many people's lives for the better, how can we take it even
further; how can we take CrossFit to the heart of the communities where social
deprivation, unemployment, poor mental health, drug, alcohol, social isolation,
a disconnect with society, crime, appalling physical health,
unhappiness, social isolation, disconnectedness from society and from one
another is rife? Because it's here where we need to see change on a global
scale; from the very bottom. </p>
<p>In my
community, there certainly aren't anywhere near enough stories like
the ones I've heard from fellow CrossFitters, </p>
<p>My view
of how we ‘fix’ that which is ‘broken’ has changed considerably since working
in mental health services these past few years. Many of us have a natural
tendency to view both people and society as ‘broken’, and as a result we look for
solutions as to how we can ‘fix’ their problems. This has been the
dominant approach for many years, by both mental health services
and by our governments; however, this approach does not seem to be
working. </p>
<p>What
makes more sense, to me at least, is to look at people and at communities and
ask: What is 'working' here? What is this person or this
community doing well? Where are the strengths? How can we build on these
strengths? And when it comes to communities, how can we extend these benefits
to the wider community? Because every community has its strengths. And in my
community, one of the biggest strengths is CrossFit. </p>
<p>This
campaign is about taking CrossFit to the rest of the communities in Wirral; to
the communities that are rated as being in the 3% most socially deprived areas
in the entire UK. Because they could really do with it. </p>

</span></b></h2>
<h2><b><span>What we need your help with</span></b></h2>
<p>In order
to do this, we need your help to kick start the project and get things off the
ground. We want to deliver free, 12 week CrossFit courses to mental health
service-users, drug &amp; alcohol service users, young people who are not in
employment, education or training, those experiencing homelessness, youth
offenders; basically anyone we can identify in the community who would benefit
from having the chance to be a part of the CrossFit community. And as well as
this, we've already put together a programme which includes the likes of
mindfulness, yoga, employability training, voluntary work and community action.
We've linked in with local organisations who are eager to be involved or show
their support to the project, including: <a href=""http://www.crossfitbromborough.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CrossFit Bromborough</a>, <a href=""www.youthfed.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Youth Federation</a>,

<p>With our
12 weeks courses, not only will we be giving people a chance to build on their
physical health, mental well-being, social networks, self-perceptions,
confidence, employability and connectedness; together, we may also be creating
future CrossFit champions. Imagine that.</p>
<p>We're
trying to raise £35,443 to run the project for one year. During this first
year we plan to work with a total of 80 people from the most deprived areas of
Wirral. Following the first year, we will then have enough data to be able to
approach investors with a solid evidence-base to show that CrossFit can
significantly impact social well-being in the heart of some of the countries
most deprived communities; and that it would be in the best interest of the
community, the local council and local health services to start investing in
this idea. </p>
<p>The money
will pay for the hire a CrossFit venue and coach, a Project
Manager, travel costs for several volunteers who will act as mentors on the
project, travel costs for participants, training costs, office space for
part-time admin, insurance, a laptop, and money towards setting up a furniture
upcycling project for participants to restore or create furniture for local
social housing tenants.</p>
<p>If we don't raise sufficient funds to run the
project for a year, every penny we do raise will be put towards running the
project for as long as possible with as many people as possible. And in that
time we can only hope to have collected enough data to then be able approach
funders with our evidence. </p>

<h2><b><span>A little bit about us</span></b></h2>
<h4><b>If you're going to invest in us, you should
probably know who we are...</b></h4>
<p>We are called APEx CIC - Advocating Physical
Exercise - and we are a non-profit community interest company. We have been
working with the Wirral community for the past 8 years, helping some of the
most vulnerable amongst us start exercising in order to experience the psychological
benefits of regular exercise. Historically, we've worked primarily with mental
health and drug and alcohol service users; however, more recently we've started
working with the entire community, no matter the problem. We acknowledge that
people from all across society want to start exercising, but like many of us
originally, find it extremely difficult to know where to start. So we offer
additional support to people in the form buddies or mentors - volunteers who work
alongside people for up to 12 weeks at a time to help them build on their
fitness, improve confidence, increase their psychological well-being, reduce
social isolation and to help them overcome any barriers preventing them from
continuing with regular exercise.</p>
<p>And not to forget <a href=""www.crossfitbromborough.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CrossFit Bromborough</a>. We’ve received
amazing support from the owner, James, and his wife, Gemma. James has led
community outreach projects for many years in the community and remains passionate and committed to
continuing with this through CrossFit in the future. </p>

<h2><b>And a bit about me</b></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>It was
just over two years ago when I started training at our community's first
CrossFit facility, CrossFit Wirral. Right away I started thinking how
incredibly life-changing it would be if APEx service-users had a chance to be a
part of a CrossFit community. The only barrier, though, was money. The majority
of APEx participants are out-of-work - mostly because of poor mental health and
a severe lack of confidence in themselves - and are therefore unable to afford
the cost of a monthly CrossFit membership. But CrossFit would help with both of
these - poor mental health and low self-confidence. </p>
<p>So this
was when my quest to get CrossFit out to the rest of the community began. Since
then I've been out and collected my own data on how CrossFit members feel their
lives have been impacted by CrossFit; I've created online questionnaires; I've
visited different facilities around the country who have been doing work with
local schools and mental health services; I've spent months putting together
bids for funding from the likes of Comic Relief and Big Lottery Fund - both of
which have been unsuccessful at this stage; I've spent
weeks liaising with other local services to tell them about my ideas
and get them on-board for future projects; and all of this I've done as a
volunteer for APEx whilst working full-time with an NHS early intervention for
psychosis service. Unfortunately, during this time, I was made redundant from
the NHS as a result of heavy austerity measures in the UK. I, like thousands of
others in the last 5 years, was a part of the 3% ‘savings’ imposed on the NHS. </p>
<p>But let’s
not get bitter. How could I be bitter when I'm now able to focus even more energy
on following what I'm truly passionate about: creating positive social change.  Firstly in my own community, and then on a
national level. If this model works to improve the social well-being in Wirral, then I believe it will work on a nationwide level.

We need to generate enough funding to get the project running for the first year, after which we plan to approach local councils with our evidence and look for investors. 

My community is in the 3% most deprived communities in the entire UK. And we have some of the lowest life-expectancy rates for men nationally. Something really does need to change. 
 If we could encourage just 4 people from every box worldwide to donate £1 each, we would have more than enough money to get started on the project. 


If you've ever done CrossFit, just quickly ask yourself the
following questions:

Has CrossFit changed your life in any way?

Has it made you a stronger person? Both physically
and mentally?
Has it helped you overcome any difficulties in your
life?
Has it changed your perception of yourself in any
way?
Have you forged new friendships with people you are
likely to be friends with for a very long time? 
Do you feel apart of something exciting? 
Do you finally feel accepted and a part of a
community?
I've
asked these same questions to so many people in the last year or two, and nearly
everyone has responded with an incredibly touching and inspirational
story. 


It was
these stories that gave me hope. Hope that positive change, on a mass-scale, is
possible. If those same stories that I hear are coming out of each and every
one of the 10, 000 CrossFit gyms worldwide, then change on a mass-scale IS possible. 
But my
question then was this: if CrossFit can facilitate so much change in the world
and impact so many people's lives for the better, how can we take it even
further; how can we take CrossFit to the heart of the communities where social
deprivation, unemployment, poor mental health, drug, alcohol, social isolation,
a disconnect with society, crime, appalling physical health,
unhappiness, social isolation, disconnectedness from society and from one
another is rife? Because it's here where we need to see change on a global
scale; from the very bottom. 
In my
community, there certainly aren't anywhere near enough stories like
the ones I've heard from fellow CrossFitters, 
My view
of how we ‘fix’ that which is ‘broken’ has changed considerably since working
in mental health services these past few years. Many of us have a natural
tendency to view both people and society as ‘broken’, and as a result we look for
solutions as to how we can ‘fix’ their problems. This has been the
dominant approach for many years, by both mental health services
and by our governments; however, this approach does not seem to be
working. 
What
makes more sense, to me at least, is to look at people and at communities and
ask: What is 'working' here? What is this person or this
community doing well? Where are the strengths? How can we build on these
strengths? And when it comes to communities, how can we extend these benefits
to the wider community? Because every community has its strengths. And in my
community, one of the biggest strengths is CrossFit. 
This
campaign is about taking CrossFit to the rest of the communities in Wirral; to
the communities that are rated as being in the 3% most socially deprived areas
in the entire UK. Because they could really do with it. 







What we need your help with
In order
to do this, we need your help to kick start the project and get things off the
ground. We want to deliver free, 12 week CrossFit courses to mental health
service-users, drug & alcohol service users, young people who are not in
employment, education or training, those experiencing homelessness, youth
offenders; basically anyone we can identify in the community who would benefit
from having the chance to be a part of the CrossFit community. And as well as
this, we've already put together a programme which includes the likes of
mindfulness, yoga, employability training, voluntary work and community action.
We've linked in with local organisations who are eager to be involved or show
their support to the project, including: CrossFit Bromborough, The Youth Federation,
Magenta Housing, AiW Health, Community Soul Cafe, Connexions, Community Action Wirral and Liverpool John Moore's University.  
With our
12 weeks courses, not only will we be giving people a chance to build on their
physical health, mental well-being, social networks, self-perceptions,
confidence, employability and connectedness; together, we may also be creating
future CrossFit champions. Imagine that.
We're
trying to raise £35,443 to run the project for one year. During this first
year we plan to work with a total of 80 people from the most deprived areas of
Wirral. Following the first year, we will then have enough data to be able to
approach investors with a solid evidence-base to show that CrossFit can
significantly impact social well-being in the heart of some of the countries
most deprived communities; and that it would be in the best interest of the
community, the local council and local health services to start investing in
this idea. 
The money
will pay for the hire a CrossFit venue and coach, a Project
Manager, travel costs for several volunteers who will act as mentors on the
project, travel costs for participants, training costs, office space for
part-time admin, insurance, a laptop, and money towards setting up a furniture
upcycling project for participants to restore or create furniture for local
social housing tenants.
If we don't raise sufficient funds to run the
project for a year, every penny we do raise will be put towards running the
project for as long as possible with as many people as possible. And in that
time we can only hope to have collected enough data to then be able approach
funders with our evidence. 



A little bit about us
If you're going to invest in us, you should
probably know who we are...
We are called APEx CIC - Advocating Physical
Exercise - and we are a non-profit community interest company. We have been
working with the Wirral community for the past 8 years, helping some of the
most vulnerable amongst us start exercising in order to experience the psychological
benefits of regular exercise. Historically, we've worked primarily with mental
health and drug and alcohol service users; however, more recently we've started
working with the entire community, no matter the problem. We acknowledge that
people from all across society want to start exercising, but like many of us
originally, find it extremely difficult to know where to start. So we offer
additional support to people in the form buddies or mentors - volunteers who work
alongside people for up to 12 weeks at a time to help them build on their
fitness, improve confidence, increase their psychological well-being, reduce
social isolation and to help them overcome any barriers preventing them from
continuing with regular exercise.
And not to forget CrossFit Bromborough. We’ve received
amazing support from the owner, James, and his wife, Gemma. James has led
community outreach projects for many years in the community and remains passionate and committed to
continuing with this through CrossFit in the future. 




And a bit about me


It was
just over two years ago when I started training at our community's first
CrossFit facility, CrossFit Wirral. Right away I started thinking how
incredibly life-changing it would be if APEx service-users had a chance to be a
part of a CrossFit community. The only barrier, though, was money. The majority
of APEx participants are out-of-work - mostly because of poor mental health and
a severe lack of confidence in themselves - and are therefore unable to afford
the cost of a monthly CrossFit membership. But CrossFit would help with both of
these - poor mental health and low self-confidence. 
So this
was when my quest to get CrossFit out to the rest of the community began. Since
then I've been out and collected my own data on how CrossFit members feel their
lives have been impacted by CrossFit; I've created online questionnaires; I've
visited different facilities around the country who have been doing work with
local schools and mental health services; I've spent months putting together
bids for funding from the likes of Comic Relief and Big Lottery Fund - both of
which have been unsuccessful at this stage; I've spent
weeks liaising with other local services to tell them about my ideas
and get them on-board for future projects; and all of this I've done as a
volunteer for APEx whilst working full-time with an NHS early intervention for
psychosis service. Unfortunately, during this time, I was made redundant from
the NHS as a result of heavy austerity measures in the UK. I, like thousands of
others in the last 5 years, was a part of the 3% ‘savings’ imposed on the NHS. 
But let’s
not get bitter. How could I be bitter when I'm now able to focus even more energy
on following what I'm truly passionate about: creating positive social change.  Firstly in my own community, and then on a
national level. If this model works to improve the social well-being in Wirral, then I believe it will work on a nationwide level.    
         









Other Ways You Can Help
I know there's going to be a lot of people out
there who want to help but can't contribute on a financial level. Don't worry,
you can still help us.
Help us get the word out and make some noise
about our campaign. The CrossFit community is the biggest and most cohesive
international community that have yet to come across. Please help us get it to
each and every one of the 10, 000 CrossFit gyms across the planet. Share on
your CrossFit Facebook page, share with your friends, share on Twitter, MySpace
(do people still use MySpace?!), Instagram, share with your Nan (Nan's love
this kind of thing).",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

With this acquisition,  we can increase our number of volunteers and begin branching out our operations to provide a more holistic diet to refugees and the homeless in Amsterdam. In addition to a cargo bike, we will also use the donated funds to purchase coolers to preserve perishable food until we can deliver it.

Food waste and Homelessness in The Netherlands 
One of the first things that made an impression on us when we first moved to the Netherlands was the unmistakable fondness for bicycles and it resonated. They give the country a quaintness reminiscent of a simpler time. Another remarkable aspect of Dutch culture is a deep appreciation for social equality and a drive for social action. When you combine these characteristics together and add a city full of generous bakeries, cafes and restaurants, you have BreadCycle. 







-Amsterdam (Attrib. Bert Kaufmann).


The Netherlands is an amazing country, with its canals, windmills and 17th century architecture. And even amid all of its beauty, there are still over 27000 people who are homeless throughout the country. Similarly, there are is a growing number of people coming from countries stricken by famine and war, seeking a better life. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, there were over 76,000 refugees living in the Netherlands and a 66% increase in asylum request between 2013 and 2014.

 While these are complex social issues, with BreadCycle we have found an elegant solution to provide homeless and refugees with a facet of support, by supplying them with edible food that would otherwise go to waste. In 2011, 2163 kilotons of avoidable food waste was produced in the Netherlands and it is our goal to put as much of this food as we can to good use.Girls at Gebr.

-Margot and Spartak delivering bread to The Rainbow Group homeless shelter.

Working with our charity partners, we are reaching out to restaurants, cafes and bakeries, asking for any easily transportable food they may have left over at the end of the day. When we have arranged a time for pick-up, one of our volunteers picks up the food and delivers it to one of our three charity partners in Amsterdam. And the more we do, the more we realize how much more could potentially be done.

Occasionally we have volunteers joining our efforts. Here is Stanislav Wald helping to deliver 25 kilos of bread! 


What we're asking


Your support can help us significantly in reducing waste and raising awareness to create a more cohesive and empathetic society. 


If this is something you can are willing to get behind, please share this campaign and follow us on Facebook to stay up to date on our organization's developments!

<p>N'étant pas très douée pour les longues logorrhées textuelles destinées à convaincre les foules, je vais donc simplement commencer par vous présenter mon projet en quelques mots.<br/>Libre à vous ensuite, si mon projet vous parle, de continuer à lire et découvrir qui je suis ainsi que mon parcours.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>Mon projet :</h2>Mon projet est simple :<br/>Suite à un licenciement économique, je me retrouve au chômage et souhaiterais me reconvertir.<br/>Mais cette fois, pas de travail par défaut qui permet de gagner un minimum survie mais laisse un goût âpre dans la bouche; ce goût âpre d'être inutile, de travailler pour un salaire de misère et de n'être qu'un pion au sein d'une entreprise dont le seul but est de rentrer de l'argent, encore et toujours plus d'argent. Non. Cette fois mon choix est de sortir de ce système pour <b>me réaliser</b>, pour faire quelque-chose de <b>constructif</b>, qui apporte quelque-chose, non seulement à moi, mais <b>à la planète</b>.<p>Car oui,<b> l'écologie</b> est un sujet qui me touche tout particulièrement, et je pense qu'aujourd'hui c'est un sujet qui devrait être primordial aux yeux de tous, pour peut-être espérer encore sauver quelque-chose...<br/><b>Mon projet est de réussir à financer la formation qui me permettra de me lancer légalement dans la réparation et le recyclage de vélos usagés.</b> <br/>On m'a souvent traité de radine pour ma tendance à récupérer tout ce qui est récupérable, mais aujourd'hui il devient une nécessité visible de lutter contre le gâchis. <br/>Et si à mon niveau je peux éviter à certains objets, comme les vélos, de finir à la poubelle et leur donner une nouvelle vie, tout en utilisant ma passion pour les travaux manuels et le bricolage, alors je me lance.<br/><br/>Mais pour me lancer j'ai obligatoirement et légalement besoin de valider les compétences que j'ai acquises seules en suivant une formation (<i>CQP Conseiller Technicien Cycle</i>), car le fait de vendre des vélos entiers est une <b>activité réglementée</b> et je ne peux l'exercer légalement sans avoir valider cette formation.<br/>Cette dernière, réalisable dans <i>l'école ProFormat à Mulhouse</i> et reconnue par l'Etat, coûte <b>2825€</b> TTC et s'étale sur 238 heures de cours + 4 mois d’expérience professionnelle en entreprise.<br/><br/>Je ne suis pas dupe, et sait pertinemment qu'un tel projet suscite moins l'engouement que le financement de tel ou tel jeu vidéo ou d'un véritable <i>Hoverboard</i> tout droit sorti de ""<i>Retour vers le futur</i>""...<br/>Mais je me dis que si ce genre de projet arrive à récolter des milliers, peut-être que le mien, le projet d'une vie, pourrait espérer récolter quelques centaines d'euros. Qui ne tente rien n'a rien. Et c'est malheureusement ma seule solution pour financer cette formation et accomplir <b>mon rêve: ouvrir mon propre atelier de récupération/recyclage/réparation de vieux vélos à Strasbourg.<br/></b><br/><br/></p><h2>De plus amples détails sur moi, mon parcours et mon projet :</h2><br/><p>
Je
m'appelle Stéphanie et vais bientôt avoir 25 ans.<br/><br/>Si vous
vivez à Strasbourg, vous avez sûrement déjà dû me croiser.
Jusqu'à début juillet, je distribuais chaque matin le journal
gratuit <i>MetroNews</i>.<br/>Cela faisait 7 ans que je
distribuais chaque matin des journaux gratuits. J'ai travaillé pour
chacun des trois grands quotidiens gratuits de France et ai été en
poste à la plupart des arrêts de trams strasbourgeois durant ces 7
années.<br/><br/>En 2013 j'ai lancé une auto-entreprise sous forme de site web de vente de T-shirts sérigraphiés, dont le faible chiffre d'affaire me permet tout juste depuis, combiné au salaire de mon temps partiel de distributrice de journaux gratuits, de payer mon loyer et les frais inhérents à une vie modeste et peu dépensière.</p>L<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">e
3 juillet MetroNews a décidé d'arrêter sa version papier. Et comme
des centaines de colporteurs en France, je me retrouve en plein plan
social, dans l'attente d'un licenciement économique qui surviendra
dans très peu de temps.<br/></span><br/>Sans travail donc, mis à part mon auto-entreprise, j'ai donc vite décidé de me retourner et de chercher une activité de remplacement.<br/><br/><p>
Etant
très manuelle, je me suis naturellement tournée vers du bricolage.
Des petites réparations en tout genre, de la sculpture sur bois, ...
Et je suis tombée sur un vieux <b>vélo</b> rouillé qu'un
de mes voisins avait mis dans la rue pour le faire enlever par le
service des objets encombrants. <br/>Ce pauvre vélo était
destiné à la déchetterie.</p>Ma nature économe pointa le bout de son nez et me souffla d'emporter le vélo chez moi pour lui redonner une seconde vie.<br/><p>
Je
l'ai donc démonté, nettoyé, dérouillé et
entièrement réparé. Et je me suis dit que j'avais trouvé ma

offert ces vélos à des amis, des voisins. Et je me suis dit qu'il
serait peut-être judicieux dans ma situation de déclarer cette
activité pour pouvoir en tirer un peu d'argent.<br/><br/>Mais le
problème est là : c'est une profession réglementée; en France,
pour exercer le métier de réparateur/vendeur de vélos, il faut
obligatoirement effectuer une formation dans le domaine.<br/>Cette
formation existe en Alsace: à Mulhouse, à l'école <i>ProFormat</i>.<br/>Mais
cette formation coûte 2825€ TTC.<br/>Et je ne réussirai
malheureusement jamais à réunir cette somme.<br/><br/>Etant donné
que je ne travaillais qu'en temps partiel, j'ai accumulé à peine 24
heures de DIF (pour 238 heures de formation), et suite à plusieurs
rendez-vous avec ma conseillère, j'ai appris que Pôle Emploi ne
financera pas un sous de cette formation...<br/><br/>En utilisant tous
mes DIF, il me manquera 2541€ pour payer cette formation.<br/>C'est
plus que ce que je gagnais en 5 mois jusqu'à présent... Soit une

BlackBox Trainer, you'll know what to eat (macros = protein, carbs, fat), how
much, how often, and have examples of what can fill those suggestions so that
you can pick things that fit your own particular tastes. Most gyms won’t
even allow their trainers to give nutrition advice.  With this function
you will be getting plans integrated with what you are doing in your workouts and life to properly fuel
you along your way to your goal.  We will start with macronutrient and
timing plans, allowing for the flexibility to choose items that are specific to your taste. As
we progress, you will be able enter what items and tastes you prefer in order to have meals (with recipes) automatically planned for you.  And then the next step is to provide you with a weekly
shopping list so that you can be even more efficient and effective with your
plan.</span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1128625/files/20150103013753-macros.jpg?1420277873"" src="""" style=""width: 230.220408163265px; height: 239px;""/>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1131641/files/20150104194710-Macronutrients-7-Health1.jpg?1420429630"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 238.628019323672px; height: 233px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p> </p><p><br/></p>

<p><b>Phased rollout
of features:</b>  For your benefit, the length of membership you
pre-order through the perks won't start applying until after we transition from
the Beta to 1.0 version. This means you get even longer use of the system! We
want to get the system to you as soon as possible, even if that means not
including all the features just yet. As we rollout features, you will be kept
updated and have access to them right away.  Here is the current plan for

<p><b>What we need:</b></p>
<p>We’ve been chipping away
at this slowly, but surely for a few years now. 
While our CTO is very skilled and has been doing great work, he needs
help.  A product like this needs a team
to flesh it out completely and to continue to maintain and improve it as we become more advanced.  One
man writing code after his full-time job and on the weekends in order to turn
an algorithm, idea, and vision into hard code is just not fair to him or the
users like yourself who could greatly benefit from this service now.  The more money we raise, the bigger and
better a team we can <a href=""#"" id=""_GPLITA_19"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by videodownloader"">hire<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important;""/></a> to accelerate the production of the service and get it

<div><a href=""http://www.workoutgenerator.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.workoutgenerator.net</a></div>
</div></div>","I believe that with
the proper plan and support, people are able to achieve their health goals.
So, I’ve created an
algorithm that replicates how I personally create customized, periodized programs of diet and exercise for clients and
surrounded it with support options.
    
                                             
    Most people stop working out because they become bored with their workouts or they don’t see the results they want to see.  Even more
people never get started because they just don’t know where to begin and the
whole process is intimidating.  Whether you need help staying engaged in your
workouts, accountability to show up when it’s tough, or the basic knowledge of
what to do, BlackBox Trainer is the tool to get you and keep you on
track.   A quality personal trainer can cost over $100/hr.  Most free software doesn't have the personalization, quality, or ""done for you"" aspect that this will.  There is just too much information out there to sort through in order to continually create workouts yourself when you would rather be working out and moving on with your day. In addition, when you create your own workouts, you're more likely to not complete them, cheat, or not do it at all. BlackBox Trainer does it all for you, with the quality of $100+/hr trainer, and at a price you can afford.    This software creates personalized
workouts for you according to
your time, skill, fitness, and equipment.  It also generates nutritional suggestions for
what you should be eating, how much, and when, in order to best reach your
goals.  Additionally, with punishment and motivation options, you can get
the accountability you need to show up to the gym even
when you don’t feel like it. All this is delivered to you in a simple to use format on your computer and your mobile
device.
                                              

The
Plans
Workout plans: Customized to you!  Just like sitting
down face to face with a trainer, you get plans that are based on your time,
goal, level of fitness, activity level, skill, equipment you have available,
gender, and age. These plans incorporate muscle confusion, periodization,
intervals, and many more fitness concepts that I have learned and used with my
clients over the years.  The plans are continually adjusting and adapting to keep you engaged and keep your body
progressing towards your goal.  As we get
more advanced, you will be able to adjust individual exercises to a higher or
lower level of difficulty within a workout. 
To start, you will be able to adjust the overall level of the workouts
up and down. Additionally, you will be able to add in outside things down the road, such as: yoga, sports games, etc.                 Nutrition plans: 
With
BlackBox Trainer, you'll know what to eat (macros = protein, carbs, fat), how
much, how often, and have examples of what can fill those suggestions so that
you can pick things that fit your own particular tastes. Most gyms won’t
even allow their trainers to give nutrition advice.  With this function
you will be getting plans integrated with what you are doing in your workouts and life to properly fuel
you along your way to your goal.  We will start with macronutrient and
timing plans, allowing for the flexibility to choose items that are specific to your taste. As
we progress, you will be able enter what items and tastes you prefer in order to have meals (with recipes) automatically planned for you.  And then the next step is to provide you with a weekly
shopping list so that you can be even more efficient and effective with your
plan.                  
                                                                   
Accountability: Some
people like positive encouragement. Most people are motivated more though by
the fear of loss rather than the hope of gain. 
We’ll provide the choice of using either or both. 
You will be able to get motivational emails, texts, and other forms of
positive encouragement.  But, you can also
elect to set yourself up with negative posts that automatically post to your Facebook or get sent to people via email if you miss a workout or an
intermediate goal.  Additionally, you’ll
be able to assign money to completing a workout or making a goal.  If you miss it, just as with a live trainer, you
lose the cash.  Now that’s motivating!! Don’t
worry, this feature is totally voluntary and you will be able to assign any dollar
amount, down to one cent.  Also, 50% of
that money we’ll be given to the Wounded Warrior Project, so you have some
solace in not hitting your mark.                                                         Sharing and social: Some
people like sharing their progress on their social media.  We’ll make that easy for you. Also, we will
be creating a system where you can be matched with another user within the
system of similar goal, gender, age, etc so that you can share stories and help
motivate each other as well.  Your own
workout buddy!
Results tracking:  At first, you will have to enter your results
manually – just as you would keep a workout log and food journal.  As we advance, wearable devices will be able
to take the place of that to automatically do it for you.  We’ll also be working on using photo
technology to make food journaling easy as well.  Additionally, we’ll have the relevant charts
you want to see: weight lost/gained, body fat lost/gained, measurement changes,
strength/power/cardio improvements, and your own personal image library to view your body transform.  All of that on a
simple dashboard for you.
(stock photo to illustrate
point: not a client of mine)

                                                                      
Other hardware: We
will be working on incorporating Bluetooth scales,body fat analyzers, and
other devices to make your results even easier to track.Retail pricing vs campaign: Since
some people will want just the workouts, and others will want just the
nutrition, we will be offering the ability to have one or both.  The
workout plans will be $7.99/mon and the nutritional plans will be
$5.99/mon.  Through this campaign, you will see discounts around 40%
off retail!  
                                            Ask yourself,“How
many people do I know that would workout more and eat a lot healthier if it
were laid out for them? How
many more would succeed if there were immediate consequences for not complying
with the program?”  If you’re like me, you probably know a lot of people
that fit those questions.  If you and I know that many people who could
use it, imagine the good that could come from this system.  Also, diet and
exercise is just the beginning.  With the amazing wearable technologies
coming out, the ability to evolve BlackBox Trainer into a system that gets
intertwined into all aspects of predicting, maintaining, and treating your
health could extend our quality of life to unprecedented
levels.
Additionally, once the
product is complete and we are generating
profit, I plan on donating
5% of the membership profit
to the children of fallen soldiers (www.childrenoffallensoldiers.org). [To be clear, these
donations will not be from the money received in this campaign.  This
money is not profit; it will going straight into developing the product.]                                                                                              
               


                        
Being a trainer with 4 different certifications, a former gym
owner, an Olympic hopeful, and a veteran, I have come to learn that it’s much
easier for people to achieve their goals and make life changes when there
is a path laid out in front of them and there is support along the way to keep them on that path.  This is why this project (BlackBox Trainer) is so important to
me.  I want the people in my life, and I am sure you want the people in
your life, to be healthy, active, and around for a long time.  I am only
one person though, so I can’t be constantly writing programs and diets,
monitoring activity, and motivating all the people that you and I want to
help.  This is why I spent over 3 years building and refining a construct
that can replicate what I
would personally produce for
anyone of my friends, family, clients, or soldiers.  With your help in
this campaign, we can finally get affordable, accessible, usable guidance to
all those people in our lives that we want to spend our years with.

                                            



                         

The algorithm is built,
the exercise library is large, a lot of code has already been written; however,
there is more that needs to be done in order to finish the product and get it
in your hands. In order to do this, I need to hire  a team of software engineers to complete the process.  The
goal posted will be used to pay this team.  It is the very minimum amount
needed to get the Beta version to those that sign up.
 We already have a substantial
amount of the code produced and this campaign will help to get us across the finish line and beyond. This is
where the stretch goals come in.  With each milestone we hit, another
person can be hired with the skill set needed to build that feature. 
Software engineers are far from cheap and the more specialized their talents
get, the more expensive it gets to hire them. 
                                              

Phased rollout
of features:  For your benefit, the length of membership you
pre-order through the perks won't start applying until after we transition from
the Beta to 1.0 version. This means you get even longer use of the system! We
want to get the system to you as soon as possible, even if that means not
including all the features just yet. As we rollout features, you will be kept
updated and have access to them right away.  Here is the current plan for
phasing the growth of the system:
Beta: gym workouts
Beta +: manual tracking, macro nutrient guidance, accountability
function, mobile responsive functionality
V.1.0: iOS and Android apps for mobile use 
V.2.0: First wearable (e.g. Atlas, fitbit, etc) integrated and native apps for iOS and Android
V.3.0: More detailed nutrition guidance with suggested weekly
shopping lists with basic meal suggestions. Workouts able to integrate other
fitness things you do, such as: yoga classes, group runs, sports leagues, etc.
V.4.0: Other hardware integrated (e.g. other wearables, body fat analyzer, scale, etc). 
V.5.0: More
Awesomeness!! see the longer list of features we plan to incorporate over the
life of the system at: www.blackboxtrainer.com
What we need:
We’ve been chipping away
at this slowly, but surely for a few years now. 
While our CTO is very skilled and has been doing great work, he needs
help.  A product like this needs a team
to flesh it out completely and to continue to maintain and improve it as we become more advanced.  One
man writing code after his full-time job and on the weekends in order to turn
an algorithm, idea, and vision into hard code is just not fair to him or the
users like yourself who could greatly benefit from this service now.  The more money we raise, the bigger and
better a team we can hire to accelerate the production of the service and get it
in your hands faster.  
Campaign Goals:
$42,500 – base line
product including gym workouts, manual tracking, macro nutrient guidance,
accountability selection, mobile responsive functionality, and apps for iOS and
android  (version 1.0)
$100,000 – integration
with ATLAS and fitbit for workout, activity, and sleep inputs (version 2.0)
$200,000 - more
detailed nutrition guidance with suggested weekly shopping lists and basic meal
suggestions (version 3.0)
$300,000 – Integration
with scales, body fat analyzer, jawbone, and others (version 4.0)
$500,000+ – vote from you
the contributors on what you would like to see incorporated!! (version 5.0)
Risks and
challenges. The biggest risk
will be not raising enough
money to hire the talent
needed.  If this is the case, the
project will continue, it will just take significantly
longer as the money will have
to come from somewhere – which would probably be portions of my income.  If
the funding goal is not reached, it could extend the production timeline from 6
months to over a year. This is why its crucial that you share the campaign with as many people as
possible and ensure that they contribute!  We would all
rather have the system operational in the next few months, instead of 15 months
down the road.  So share
the campaign and follow up with folks to make sure they
contribute!

can't do this without you! Take action now and help us bring to you the
technology that can change your life and those of the ones you love!

limits of white bass, walleye, and crappie resulting in very sore thumbs by the
end of the process.  Two fish slipped back into the lake.  They looked at each other and said: ""There has to be something to help us Fillet a Better Way!"" After several hours in our garage we had made the clamp and board shown below.  </span>
</h3>
<p> This clamp worked well holding fish on its side anchoring it for the fillet process.  To our surprise there was no product like this prototype in the Patent system, so we submitted a patent application.  The result was a Utility and Process Patent for the TWO WAY Fillet™ fish cleaning system, that keeps the meat and leaves the bones behind.  We found that using TWO WAY Fillet™ made cleaning fish fast, safe, with less waste, and with less cuts, scrapes, sticks and pressure on hands and thumbs - like giving you a third hand!</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Many anglers cringe when it is time to clean the fish because it is messy, the fish slip all over the place and the chance for getting stuck or cut by a fin or knife is very real.  TWO WAY Fillet™ fish cleaning equipment is proving it can change those ideas and opinions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The secret is the way TWO WAY FIllet™ holds the fish by replacing the anglers thumb and forefinger on the lower jaw of the fish, positioning the fish on its side when you snap the clamp into the board.</li>

</ul>
</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need - to Launch TWO WAY Fillet</h3>
<div>Immediate funding needs:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">$4,500 to fund CAD drawings and  prototyping</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">$24,000 injection mold tooling for fillet board</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">$16,000 Injection Mold for clamp</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">$15.000 to make first production run of 1,500</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">Indiegogo funding added to our own investment to date will help to fund our first 12 months!  All funds over goal will be to put to ongoing patent expenses, increased production, travel and expenses of sport show displays and advertising.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are working with a plastic company in Oklahoma City to have the mold made, and then to make the TWO WAY Fillet™ fish cleaning system there as well.  These funds listed come from their proposal to us.</span></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Impact of Project</h3>
<p>Help change the opinion of many anglers - that cleaning fish is messy, dangerous, and hard.  Replace that notion with this game changing invention - TWO WAY Fillet™.  </p>
<p>More anglers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Will want to clean their catch -  will do it faster and  more accurately which means they will save more of their fish to serve for dinner.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>Will be excited not just to go fishing, but to keep, clean and serve their catch for dinner.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">Will improve the safety of cleaning fish - improved safety and accuracy means less hand and finger cuts, abrasions and sticks.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>Will be able to Fillet A Better Way™, as if they had a third hand.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Biggest challenge for us it to raise the money.   We have already had prototypes expenses, patent expenses, trademark expenses, and more.  We have shared our prototypes with several professional anglers and countless avid anglers all of whom have told us they want one.  One professional angler told us he that he never found a production fillet board to be any better than an old 2x6 that he uses.  However, this changed his mind. and he<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> wants one from the first production run.   </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Secondly, getting TWO WAY Fillet™ into distribution channels.  We have 3 professional anglers with contacts in this arena who have told us they will help with this once we have production inventory.  One is editor of fishing magazine and has told us he will have an article written about it when launched.</span></p>

</div></div>","TWO WAY Fillet™ - Fish Cleaning System
Fillet A Better Way™

Our Story:   Two friends were busy cleaning
limits of white bass, walleye, and crappie resulting in very sore thumbs by the
end of the process.  Two fish slipped back into the lake.  They looked at each other and said: ""There has to be something to help us Fillet a Better Way!"" After several hours in our garage we had made the clamp and board shown below.  

 This clamp worked well holding fish on its side anchoring it for the fillet process.  To our surprise there was no product like this prototype in the Patent system, so we submitted a patent application.  The result was a Utility and Process Patent for the TWO WAY Fillet™ fish cleaning system, that keeps the meat and leaves the bones behind.  We found that using TWO WAY Fillet™ made cleaning fish fast, safe, with less waste, and with less cuts, scrapes, sticks and pressure on hands and thumbs - like giving you a third hand!
First working TWO WAY Fillet™ working clamp:


                   Original Home Made Prototype HDPE  Board With Hinge

Many anglers cringe when it is time to clean the fish because it is messy, the fish slip all over the place and the chance for getting stuck or cut by a fin or knife is very real.  TWO WAY Fillet™ fish cleaning equipment is proving it can change those ideas and opinions.

The secret is the way TWO WAY FIllet™ holds the fish by replacing the anglers thumb and forefinger on the lower jaw of the fish, positioning the fish on its side when you snap the clamp into the board.


The secret is how the TWO WAY Fillet™ positions the fish on the board:



TWO WAY Fillet™ system anchors the slippery fish to the fillet board on its side, freeing up a hand, like giving the angler a third hand.  This means that novice to experienced anglers alike will be able to fillet fish with confidence, safety and more accuracy - meaning more fish for dinner!
Perfect Gift Idea for every Angler.

When you are faced with a huge mess of fish to clean:


TWO WAY Fillet™ will help anglers finish this job easily, and go from the fish cleaning house to here:




Whether baked or fried, boneless fresh fish is delicious! 
It is also important to have an official taste tester:



Prototype in Use:   (Locusts heard in Background) :




This video shows a prototype in action with a nice white bass.  (No Locusts were harmed while taping this video.)
Your participation in this project will help jump start the launch of this  new, innovative, game changing fish cleaning equipment for all anglers. This means that more anglers will learn and enjoy cleaning their catch, which means that more family and friends will be able to enjoy freshly caught fish for lunch or dinner.

  What We Need - to Launch TWO WAY Fillet
Immediate funding needs:


$4,500 to fund CAD drawings and  prototyping


$24,000 injection mold tooling for fillet board

$16,000 Injection Mold for clamp
$15.000 to make first production run of 1,500
Indiegogo funding added to our own investment to date will help to fund our first 12 months!  All funds over goal will be to put to ongoing patent expenses, increased production, travel and expenses of sport show displays and advertising.
We are working with a plastic company in Oklahoma City to have the mold made, and then to make the TWO WAY Fillet™ fish cleaning system there as well.  These funds listed come from their proposal to us.



Impact of Project
Help change the opinion of many anglers - that cleaning fish is messy, dangerous, and hard.  Replace that notion with this game changing invention - TWO WAY Fillet™.  
More anglers:


Will want to clean their catch -  will do it faster and  more accurately which means they will save more of their fish to serve for dinner.

Will be excited not just to go fishing, but to keep, clean and serve their catch for dinner.

Will improve the safety of cleaning fish - improved safety and accuracy means less hand and finger cuts, abrasions and sticks.

Will be able to Fillet A Better Way™, as if they had a third hand.

  Risks & Challenges Biggest challenge for us it to raise the money.   We have already had prototypes expenses, patent expenses, trademark expenses, and more.  We have shared our prototypes with several professional anglers and countless avid anglers all of whom have told us they want one.  One professional angler told us he that he never found a production fillet board to be any better than an old 2x6 that he uses.  However, this changed his mind. and he wants one from the first production run.   
Secondly, getting TWO WAY Fillet™ into distribution channels.  We have 3 professional anglers with contacts in this arena who have told us they will help with this once we have production inventory.  One is editor of fishing magazine and has told us he will have an article written about it when launched.


Built an information website on fishing:  www.practical-fishing-tips.com  - over 160 pages of information including cleaning fish, fillet boards, and much more.
Built website - online store www.filletboard.com .  Although viewable, this site is still under construction, which means that the store is not live yet, but will go live with first production run. 
We have registered and own 6 domain names surrounding the words fillet board.
4 trusted, experienced, professional anglers have used a TWO WAY Fillet™ prototype and approved of its usage.   They each one encouraged us to proceed and have given testimonials and have requested their own TWO WAY Fillet™ to use with customers.
Identified other professional anglers/guides who are interested in finished product, and have volunteered to test and write articles.  They have also agreed to use TWO WAY Fillet to clean their fish in front of customers.
Will attend sport/fishing shows demonstrating TWF system
Will market to marina's and fishing shops across Midwest and walleye country.
Have discussed with 2 buyers for sport shops and retail stores who want to see the finished product.

<p>My husband Gary and I bought
our first scooters in 2006 for our 5<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary. We
bought two 50cc Honda Metropolitans and immediately fell in love with
scootering. A month later, we took our little 50cc scooters on a 700 mile road trip
across two states. It was the trip of a lifetime.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431957561/bycbjhtjqa747h6spezw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Scootering became the center
of our lives. In the fall of 2006 we attended our first scooter rally –
Scoot-a-Que organized by the local scooter club the Columbus Cutters.  Gary organized an on-line
scooter club called the Easy Peasey Scooter Posse which today boasts over 150
members. Through scootering, we met amazing people who have become lifelong friends. Those of us in Columbus ride together every Sunday and play scooter
tag; the Posse has grown to be a wonderful online community of scooterists.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2008 Gary and
I decided to live our dream by opening our own scooter shop so we could spend
24/7 doing all things scooter related. One week before we were scheduled to
open Gary suffered a heart attack and passed away on December 10<sup>th</sup>.
Our dream, however, did not die. Gary's son Chris, in one of the most selfless
acts I have ever witnessed, offered to move from Kansas to Columbus and help me
run the shop.<span>  Four days after his
father's funeral Chris packed what he could in his car and moved in with me,
leaving his friends and family behind to help continue, what is now, the Didier
dream business.  Chris has an automotive technology degree and is an incredibly
skilled and dedicated mechanic.  In the
midst of grieving over his father's passing and moving to a new city where he
knew no one, Chris jumped in and has built the reputation Gary and I sought to
achieve - that of providing quality, honest service for members of the scooter
community.  In fact, he has outdone
himself to the point that for the last
two years we have been booked 6 weeks out for service. We simply do not have
the room to take in more bikes for service. 
After 6 ½ years, we have outgrown our space.</span></p>

<p>Then, in one of those “meant
to be” moments, I learned that the historic Glen Echo Garage was for sale. This
was the location where Gary and I had wanted to originally open the shop but it
wasn’t available then. I approached my dad, an entrepreneur himself, who I
deeply admire and who’s opinion I cherish, and asked what he thought. He was
100% behind the idea and said how proud he was of us and how far we’ve come.</p>
<p>This
is an important step in the growth of our business. We anticipate we can not
only cut down on the time people have to wait for a service appointment but
that we could double the amount of service our current location currently
limits us to. We will be able to control our costs. We will have a parking lot!
No more jockeying for a space on the street. And we will be right around the
corner from our current location. We feel this move will help our neighbors as
well. As a scooter shop we will continue the history and keep the integrity of
the building as a service garage. I was born and raised and currently live in
the University District and, following in my mom’s footsteps, am committed to
the preservation and well-being of this community. In short, it’s perfect!</p>
<p>After much number crunching we
realized that we can afford the mortgage and monthly expenses associated with a
larger space. So we negotiated with the Seller and now we are in contract! However,
as a small mom and pop (or mom and stepson in this case) business, what we
don’t have is the down payment. We are using our own savings towards the down
payment and the cost of the move but we need help. </p>
<p>This is where all of you wonderful
people come in! Help us keep small business thriving in Columbus, help us keep
a unique and historic building in the community. Summers are short! Help us to
ensure you don’t lose half a riding season waiting to get your scooter in for
repairs. It’s a win- win all around. You can help by sharing our campaign and
making a contribution! Every contribution will be commemorated on a contributor

<p>Bruce
Molzan’s many years of experience in several famous Houston restaurants have
made him one of the region’s most celebrated chefs.  After bringing his most recent projects,
Ruggles Green and Corner Table, to a spectacular success, he reinvented himself
once again with the opening of Ruggles Black with partner Neera Patidar in 2014.  <br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>And, like with everything Molzan does, he has created yet another
one-of-kind menu unlike anything else in the country making him the King of
Paleo among foodies everywhere.</p>
<p>Molzan’s
quest to constantly reinvent himself and his culinary art began with his
training under nationally acclaimed chefs, Herve Glin, who served as a mentor,
and at Los Angeles’ Spago under Wolfgang Puck.<span> 
However, it was at the Warwick Hotel in Houston, Texas, that Molzan was
credited with changing the Houston dining landscaping by nixing the traditional
meat and two sides entrees and replacing them with creative and inventive fresh
farm-to-table vegetables and over the top signature desserts.  </span></p>
<p>Since
the 1980s, Molzan has been a mainstay on the Houston restaurant scene
constantly on the cutting edge of new trends and exceeding expectations across
the Ruggles brand with other favorites such as: Ruggles 5115, Ruggles Bakery,
Ruggles Bistro Latino, Corner Table, Ruggles Green, and Ruggles Black.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Among
his many local, regional and nation accolades, Bruce Molzan is a Bocuse d’Or
winner. He is called upon by countless
celebrities and remains a favorite of professional athletes – serving as the

Welcome to Baby Ruggles,
 where we're bringing Paleo cuisine and classic French pastry together 
in a modern and electric atmosphere. We are converting the Oui Desserts location on Kirby and Richmond into a new bakery, Baby Ruggles Bakery and Food Bar, offering decadent pastries, paleo desserts,  coffees, and clean sandwiches on artisan breads, and any money given here will contribute to our renovation using local, green products.The Paleo Revolution, being lead by Bruce Molzan, offers unprocessed, healthy, flavorful food to the 
masses. Molzan has teamed up with pastry chef, Jennifer Ramos, a 
classically french trained patissier, to realize this concept in our new
 location in the trendy Upper Kirby area(currently Oui Desserts). Join us, and be a part of the 
rise of pastry innovation in Houston.  







The Impact
Paleo fare introduces a new way of eating that is sustainable to the environment, and free of processed foods. It harkens back to a time 2.5 million years ago when humans were lean, and ate whole foods like nuts, berries, meats, and vegetables. Fast forward to modern times and the average human is overweight, unhealthy, and unhappy with a diet of processed grains, sugars, and corn. Help us bring healthy, tasty, and delicious Paleo to your table!



   What We Need & What You Get
We
 are seeking to raise $50,000 for the remodel of our new location and 
the latest equipment to bring Paleo to the multitudes. Once a 
contributor, you will become an integral part of our pastry 
transformation, and will be afforded unique opportunities such as, 
private baking lessons with Chef Jennifer Ramos or Bruce Molzan in your 
home, discounts, free desserts, and an all access pass to the grand 
opening of our bakery.  Embark with us on this venture and delve into 
the sugar coated world of Baby Ruggles.

Bruce Molzan



Bruce
Molzan’s many years of experience in several famous Houston restaurants have
made him one of the region’s most celebrated chefs.  After bringing his most recent projects,
Ruggles Green and Corner Table, to a spectacular success, he reinvented himself
once again with the opening of Ruggles Black with partner Neera Patidar in 2014.  

And, like with everything Molzan does, he has created yet another
one-of-kind menu unlike anything else in the country making him the King of
Paleo among foodies everywhere.
Molzan’s
quest to constantly reinvent himself and his culinary art began with his
training under nationally acclaimed chefs, Herve Glin, who served as a mentor,
and at Los Angeles’ Spago under Wolfgang Puck. 
However, it was at the Warwick Hotel in Houston, Texas, that Molzan was
credited with changing the Houston dining landscaping by nixing the traditional
meat and two sides entrees and replacing them with creative and inventive fresh
farm-to-table vegetables and over the top signature desserts.  
Since
the 1980s, Molzan has been a mainstay on the Houston restaurant scene
constantly on the cutting edge of new trends and exceeding expectations across
the Ruggles brand with other favorites such as: Ruggles 5115, Ruggles Bakery,
Ruggles Bistro Latino, Corner Table, Ruggles Green, and Ruggles Black.  
Among
his many local, regional and nation accolades, Bruce Molzan is a Bocuse d’Or
winner. He is called upon by countless
celebrities and remains a favorite of professional athletes – serving as the
Houston Texans Taste of the NFL chef. 
Like with all Molzan’s restaurants, his out-of-the-box vision for
creating a one-of-a-kind dining experience is only magnified by his demands for
exceptional service and an always lively atmosphere.

<p></p><p>Hi everyone! Thanks so much for checking out
our crowd funding page.  My husband, Al and I started Far From the Tree at
the end of 2013 after returning from a three-year sabbatical in England.
 It was there Al gained valuable experience making wine in Europe and
earning his wine making degree. While he kept busy with his studies, I was
falling madly in love with dry English ciders.  In July of 2013, we
decided to move back to Massachusetts and create ciders that were not available
in the U.S. market. And so Far From the Tree was born, with a mission to
produce traditional, <em><span>small batch</span></em>,
barrel-aged hard cider.</p>
<p>Al is the head of cider development and I run
the operational side of the business.  Our cider house is located in Salem
where we’ve been making cider since February of last year.  What sets Far
From the Tree apart from the competition is our commitment to the local
community. We use 100 percent Massachusetts apples and natural, locally-sourced
ingredients in all of our products while adhering to traditional cider-making
methods that go back hundreds of years. Cider was the drink of choice in early
America, especially here in New England. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431377022/mgk5wyerce4k9avkiojy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><p>During our first year, we’ve done so many
great events from beer and wine festivals to fundraisers, tastings at liquor
stores and being a part of several farmers markets. Receiving direct
feedback from our patrons is of great importance to us.  We are passionate about creating new and
interesting combinations that really get people excited about our cider. Their
opinion is what keeps us motivated to continue to develop new varietals.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: We always knew we wanted to open
a space where the community could stop by to see what we are up to, learn how
we make our cider and also have the opportunity to sample our latest
experiments. Well, we have found that space!  Our tasting room will
be located at the corner of Jackson Street and Jefferson Avenue, about a half
mile from downtown Salem. This is the perfect location for us since it is right
next door to our cider house. While we have the funds to pay for rent, we
will really need help from the community to build out this awesome space. We
are planning to open our tasting room doors this summer!</p><p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p></p><p>We are asking for at least $10,000 to help us
make our tasting room one of the coolest community spaces in Salem. The
funds will be used for tables and chairs, lighting, paint, flooring, a dishwasher,
glassware and outside signs.  As a token of our appreciation, we will
shower you with some pretty unique gifts, including: t-shirts, glasses,
discounts on cider and merchandise, a mug club, a “meet the cider makers”
party, a tutorial on how to make cider, an opportunity to create a new varietal

<p><b>Community Impact</b></p>
<p></p><p>Our company has been part of a group that has worked
to change the zoning ordinance that allows breweries, wineries and distilleries
to be located in Salem.  Before last summer, there was no use. Receiving
approval to open our tasting room from the zoning board is not just a win for
us, it is a win for the community. The city of Salem is more than just the
month of October. It’s a thriving community of creative professionals and we
are honored to be considered a part of this movement. We have felt at home here
since day one. The community has been incredibly supportive and that notion
alone has been the main catalyst for us to create this space. We envision being
open six days a week and having special events regularly with music, poetry
readings, artist exhibits, etc. We want to showcase not only our cider,
but the impressive creative community that exists here in Salem.</p>
<p>We believe we have created a growing fan base
comprised of people who are interested in seeing what we are up to next.
 We are truly committed to using 100 percent Massachusetts apples and high
quality ingredients.  We do not comprise on this.  Our ciders are
mostly dry and we are working on a line of off-dry cider that will have a
little more maple syrup added to enhance the apples’ flavor.  We plan on
experimenting as much as we can so our fans will keep coming back to sample our
latest and greatest products.  We value feedback from the community so
please let us know if you have any ideas for a new cider. </p><p>

of access to pediatric healthcare. Many children will spend their entire
childhood  without ever seeing a Pediatrician and families are relying
on very basic health care offered by occasional health brigades and local
nurses. Many
of the rural medical facilities are deficient of basic medical supplies, equipment and
people are required to travel large distances for adequate care.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to change that....</span></p>
<p><span>The focus of
the project is to offer basic pediatric health care, including well and
sick child care, preventive medicine and education on a variety of health
related topics in various communities along the coast.</span></p>
<p><span>So, this is what I will do:</span></p>

<p>1. STATEMENT OF
PROBLEM</p>
<p><b>1.1 Introduction to the problem</b></p>
<p>The state of Oaxaca is one of the
poorest and most underdeveloped states in Mexico. This area suffers from
shortages of many things; medical and dental care being some of the more
serious needs of these communities.</p>
<p>The cities and large towns have medical
care available especially for those who can pay for it. In small, out of the
way towns, where only a subsistence style of living is available, medical care
is sparse and qualified pediatric care mostly not available. In these
communities with high rates of poverty and disease and with limited access to
health resources, children are extremely vulnerable as parents may not have the
means or sufficient knowledge to provide nutritious meals, pay for clinic
visits, prevent accidents or recognize potentially serious childhood illnesses.</p>
<p>Childhood is a critical time for
physical, mental and emotional development and serious health problems during
this time can adversely affect an individual for the rest of their life. Children
suffering from malnutrition, infectious diseases, violence, injuries, and
chronic diseases (HIV, asthma, etc.) are more likely to have challenges
learning in school and less likely to succeed. Recognizing and treating these
health issues as soon as possible will allow them to recover and increase their
capacity to learn and gain a meaningful education. Preventing and treating
disease in childhood is essential for the development of individuals,
communities and the nation.</p>
<p>Examples of the illnesses that are
common in these communities are malnutrition (in both of its extremes: Obese
and underweight children), anemia, respiratory illness, asthma, intestinal
parasites, chronic diarrhea, Dengue fever and other tropical diseases.</p>
<p><b>1.2 Statement of need </b></p>
<p>There is an apparent need for pediatric
and primary health care in these low-income areas. Limited transportation, lack
of access to health related information, cultural differences and language
barriers are some of the factors leading to suboptimal healthcare coverage in
this area.</p>
<p>These
communities are among those with a high percentage of children living in
poverty and without access to general health care, let alone specialized
pediatric care.</p>
<p>As
a traveling health clinic whose purpose is to effectively provide access to the
high quality healthcare to underserved children from birth to 18 years we would
like to build strong community-based relationships. These partnerships will
allow to gain community trust, leverage resources, improve program
capacity and increase access to healthcare for children in need.</p>
<p>There is a need for “medical home” for
each patient.  A medical home is not a place – it’s a partnership between
a pediatric clinician and the child and family. By establishing an ongoing
relationship, supported by our custom made electronic health record <span>system, the health care provider can follow through to
ensure all a child’s health needs are met. </span></p>
<p>That’s an important approach. But,
children who have been medically underserved and are challenged by poverty,
need even more.  They often have multiple medical issues and problems that
have compounded. </p>
<p>Ironically, these children who often
need the most care are the ones who typically have access to the least. 
We believe that these kids need an “enhanced medical home” that provides
primary pediatric care, including screening, prevention, identification and
management of acute and chronic conditions, as well as health education for the
children and their family.</p>
<p><span>2. PROJECT

<p><b>2.4 Project overview</b></p>
<p>The Pediatric Mobile Clinic will travel

<p>The
Clinic also will provide significant patient-centered health education focusing
on healthy balanced nutrition, importance of physical activity, basic first
aid, and common childhood illnesses. We will provide this education through
interactive PowerPoint presentations, group discussions and through the
development of community lead health projects. We believe that it is important
that families take responsibility for their own health and want to support them
in making healthier and better choices for their children and themselves. </p>
<p><b><u>Pharmacy</u></b><b>:</b></p>
<p>We will provide common pediatric
medications from an on-board pharmacy since the nearest pharmacy is often miles
away and many families cannot afford the necessary medications for their
children. We will sell medication at wholesale prices to make them more
accessible. </p>
<p><b>2.4.1 The first phase (4-6 weeks)</b></p>
<p>During this initial phase we will
purchase this well preserved microbús. With a team of already
established volunteers, including an experienced mechanic we will convert this
unit into a full functioning pediatric mobile practice.</p>
<p><b>2.4.2 The second phase (4-6 weeks)</b></p>
<p>During this phase we will contact local
authorities to ask for their support in this project and will establish a schedule
for visits in the initial 8 communities. In each community we will create a
group of local volunteers that are willing to help and support the project. We
will also start advertising the service in the communities, working closely
with local government agencies, schools and </p>
<p><b>2.4.3 The third phase</b></p>
<p>During this phase we will initiate our
visits to the different communities. All visits will be documented in our
electronic medical record system, which will allow adequate follow up and
facilitate continuous care. The goal is to see between 20-30 patients per day,
which allows an adequate amount of time spent with each patient. </p>
<p><b>2.5 Anticipated outcomes</b></p>
<p>The community will
benefit by the increased access to quality care. As an immediate benefit we will contribute
to lower infant and child morbidity rates and increase knowledge and awareness throughout
the population via multiple educational presentations.</p>
<p>Because of the clinic's regularly
scheduled visits to the communities, a long term follow up of patients will be
possible, including monitoring of growth and development and closer follow up
on chronic conditions and reoccurring problems that can be addressed on a
regular basis. This is an improvement compared to the health brigades that
visit these communities much less frequent.</p>
<p>With increasing experience the goal is
to identify and expand services to additional areas in need, for example
maternal healthcare, dental care etc.</p>
<p><b>2.6 Mobile Medical Care Unit </b></p>
<p>The used microbus is in very good
condition and is being offered at an attractive price. Turning it
into a full functioning medical mobile unit will require remodeling and
adjusting the interior design, including fitting it <span style=""background-color: initial;"">an A/C unit and clean water supply structures, as well as</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> basic diagnostic
and medical equipment.  The size of the
mobile unit will allow for medical diagnostic support in form of a small lab.</span></p>
<p><b>2.7 Staffing and Maintenance</b></p>
<p>The medical director and pediatrician
for this mobile unit will be Dr. Anja Widmann, a board certified pediatrician
that works at her pediatric office in Puerto Escondido, supported by local
volunteers( including nurses, anthropologists, nutritionists and midwifes/
doulas) who already expressed their desire to participate in this project. The
mobile clinic will be maintained by local volunteers and a mechanic, who are supporting this project. </p>

Does turning a
bus into a medical office sound crazy to you? Well, maybe it is... but it's also a great way to bring healthcare to those who need it the most.
My name is Anja Widmann and I´m an American
Board Certified pediatrician. After completing medical school in Germany
and pediatric residency in New York, I moved to Puerto Escondido,
Mexico to open a pediatric practice in 2012. Some would call that crazy, too.
But it has been very rewarding, interesting and challenging.

                                         Now it´s time to expand that care to communities further off the grid.
Along the coast
of Oaxaca, one of the poorest states in Mexico, there is a lack
of access to pediatric healthcare. Many children will spend their entire
childhood  without ever seeing a Pediatrician and families are relying
on very basic health care offered by occasional health brigades and local
nurses. Many
of the rural medical facilities are deficient of basic medical supplies, equipment and
people are required to travel large distances for adequate care.
I want to change that....
The focus of
the project is to offer basic pediatric health care, including well and
sick child care, preventive medicine and education on a variety of health
related topics in various communities along the coast.
So, this is what I will do:

             

I will remodel this bus into a fully functional mobile medical unit and I will visit communities along the Oaxacan Coast 1-2 days per week. There will be an affordable fee for consultations, in order to cover ongoing expenses and to ensure self sustainability of the project.

I NEED YOUR HELP to fund the purchase and transformation of the bus. Please donate and support a project
with a direct impact on local healthcare!!
FYI, I´m not affiliated with any religious, political or non- governmental organizations. 
If you have any questions please contact me at dra.anja@oasisdelpacifico.com!   In case you want to know more details:
 A lot more details....


1. STATEMENT OF
PROBLEM
1.1 Introduction to the problem
The state of Oaxaca is one of the
poorest and most underdeveloped states in Mexico. This area suffers from
shortages of many things; medical and dental care being some of the more
serious needs of these communities.
The cities and large towns have medical
care available especially for those who can pay for it. In small, out of the
way towns, where only a subsistence style of living is available, medical care
is sparse and qualified pediatric care mostly not available. In these
communities with high rates of poverty and disease and with limited access to
health resources, children are extremely vulnerable as parents may not have the
means or sufficient knowledge to provide nutritious meals, pay for clinic
visits, prevent accidents or recognize potentially serious childhood illnesses.
Childhood is a critical time for
physical, mental and emotional development and serious health problems during
this time can adversely affect an individual for the rest of their life. Children
suffering from malnutrition, infectious diseases, violence, injuries, and
chronic diseases (HIV, asthma, etc.) are more likely to have challenges
learning in school and less likely to succeed. Recognizing and treating these
health issues as soon as possible will allow them to recover and increase their
capacity to learn and gain a meaningful education. Preventing and treating
disease in childhood is essential for the development of individuals,
communities and the nation.
Examples of the illnesses that are
common in these communities are malnutrition (in both of its extremes: Obese
and underweight children), anemia, respiratory illness, asthma, intestinal
parasites, chronic diarrhea, Dengue fever and other tropical diseases.
1.2 Statement of need 
There is an apparent need for pediatric
and primary health care in these low-income areas. Limited transportation, lack
of access to health related information, cultural differences and language
barriers are some of the factors leading to suboptimal healthcare coverage in
this area.
These
communities are among those with a high percentage of children living in
poverty and without access to general health care, let alone specialized
pediatric care.
As
a traveling health clinic whose purpose is to effectively provide access to the
high quality healthcare to underserved children from birth to 18 years we would
like to build strong community-based relationships. These partnerships will
allow to gain community trust, leverage resources, improve program
capacity and increase access to healthcare for children in need.
There is a need for “medical home” for
each patient.  A medical home is not a place – it’s a partnership between
a pediatric clinician and the child and family. By establishing an ongoing
relationship, supported by our custom made electronic health record system, the health care provider can follow through to
ensure all a child’s health needs are met. 
That’s an important approach. But,
children who have been medically underserved and are challenged by poverty,
need even more.  They often have multiple medical issues and problems that
have compounded. 
Ironically, these children who often
need the most care are the ones who typically have access to the least. 
We believe that these kids need an “enhanced medical home” that provides
primary pediatric care, including screening, prevention, identification and
management of acute and chronic conditions, as well as health education for the
children and their family.
2. PROJECT
DESCRIPTION
2.1 Mission Statement
The Oasis del Pacífico Mobile Pediatric
Care Unit  will provide affordable, high quality primary pediatric care and
family-centered education to communities along the Oaxacan Coast.
2.2 Statement of purpose
A mobile pediatric
care unit, covering a various communities along the Oaxacan coast will
accomplish the following: 
1) Increase access to
cost effective, high quality pediatric care.
2) Provide the type of
care that supports, educates and reinforces families’ health choices.
3) Provide
family-centered care that promotes strong familiar bonds.
2.3 Geographic
reach & Population served


The mobile
clinic will be based out of Puerto Escondido, a small town on the pacific coast
in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Initially will offer services to communities
within eight selected municipios of the districts of Juquila and Pochutla. 

1. 
District of Juquila:
· 
San Gabriel Mixtepec
· 
San Pedro Mixtepec· 
Santos Reyes Nopala· 
Santa Catarina Juquila
2.  District
of Pochutla
· 
San Pedro Pochutla· 
San Baltazar Loxicha· 
Santa Maria Tonameca· 
San Sebastián Coatlán
These
communities lack local access to nearby basic pediatric care and patients and
their families are required to travel large distances to receive such care. 
2.4 Project overview
The Pediatric Mobile Clinic will travel
to communities along the Oaxacan Coast, providing pediatric health care where
it is needed the most. 
Healthcare:

The
Pediatric Mobile Clinic will improve the quality of care and the overall health
of children living in these communities by bringing services directly to the
populations at highest risk, providing comprehensive medical care including:
· 
Well-child exams· 
Sick visits· 
Basic laboratory testing· 
An array of health & developmental screenings
Health education:
The
Clinic also will provide significant patient-centered health education focusing
on healthy balanced nutrition, importance of physical activity, basic first
aid, and common childhood illnesses. We will provide this education through
interactive PowerPoint presentations, group discussions and through the
development of community lead health projects. We believe that it is important
that families take responsibility for their own health and want to support them
in making healthier and better choices for their children and themselves. 
Pharmacy:
We will provide common pediatric
medications from an on-board pharmacy since the nearest pharmacy is often miles
away and many families cannot afford the necessary medications for their
children. We will sell medication at wholesale prices to make them more
accessible. 
2.4.1 The first phase (4-6 weeks)
During this initial phase we will
purchase this well preserved microbús. With a team of already
established volunteers, including an experienced mechanic we will convert this
unit into a full functioning pediatric mobile practice.
2.4.2 The second phase (4-6 weeks)
During this phase we will contact local
authorities to ask for their support in this project and will establish a schedule
for visits in the initial 8 communities. In each community we will create a
group of local volunteers that are willing to help and support the project. We
will also start advertising the service in the communities, working closely
with local government agencies, schools and 
2.4.3 The third phase
During this phase we will initiate our
visits to the different communities. All visits will be documented in our
electronic medical record system, which will allow adequate follow up and
facilitate continuous care. The goal is to see between 20-30 patients per day,
which allows an adequate amount of time spent with each patient. 
2.5 Anticipated outcomes
The community will
benefit by the increased access to quality care. As an immediate benefit we will contribute
to lower infant and child morbidity rates and increase knowledge and awareness throughout
the population via multiple educational presentations.
Because of the clinic's regularly
scheduled visits to the communities, a long term follow up of patients will be
possible, including monitoring of growth and development and closer follow up
on chronic conditions and reoccurring problems that can be addressed on a
regular basis. This is an improvement compared to the health brigades that
visit these communities much less frequent.
With increasing experience the goal is
to identify and expand services to additional areas in need, for example
maternal healthcare, dental care etc.
2.6 Mobile Medical Care Unit 
The used microbus is in very good
condition and is being offered at an attractive price. Turning it
into a full functioning medical mobile unit will require remodeling and
adjusting the interior design, including fitting it an A/C unit and clean water supply structures, as well as basic diagnostic
and medical equipment.  The size of the
mobile unit will allow for medical diagnostic support in form of a small lab.
2.7 Staffing and Maintenance
The medical director and pediatrician
for this mobile unit will be Dr. Anja Widmann, a board certified pediatrician
that works at her pediatric office in Puerto Escondido, supported by local
volunteers( including nurses, anthropologists, nutritionists and midwifes/
doulas) who already expressed their desire to participate in this project. The
mobile clinic will be maintained by local volunteers and a mechanic, who are supporting this project. 
Ok, let´s talk money.....Budget Overview
We need help purchasing, repairing, remodeling, repainting, refurnishing & adapting this bus into a mobile medical unit.
In order to make the project self- sustainable and to not depend on further funding we will cover all operational cost ( fuel, repairs, medical supplies, salaries etc) through the reasonable nominal fees we´ll charge for our services ( between 100-200 Mexican pesos ( = approx. 6-12 US dollars )per patient encounter).

This Budget is an estimate after detailed inspection of the Camper Van and requested quotes for adjustments, repairs and refitting etc.

</div><div> <p> Ciao! I'm Ivano, a 31 years old Italian mate!</p>
<p>After 10 years of working in the hectic film production industry in Milan, I decided that I needed to slow down. </p>
<p>So, I headed to Australia where I ended up spending 2 years. During this time, I mainly worked and travelled by myself cruising across the country. After my experienced finished in the Downunder, like many other backpackers, my plan wasn't different, and I headed to Asia. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The differences between the western and asian world are huge, as a tourist, one notice the various colours, smells and tastes </span>immediately<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Locals spend most of their time in the streets and life goes on at a different pace too. At the beginning all these differences disoriented me, but then I realised how this lifestyle allows people to share much more, the weather encourages people to be outdoors too, and not long after, I felt in love with the asian culture.   </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I travelled around Southeast Asia for a while but when I went to Cambodia I felt my soul in peace....and my second visit to <b>Cambodia</b> resulted in a 10 years leasing!<br/></span></p>

<p></p>Cambodians are smiling, simple and big-hearted people who had a recent sad story to tell. I personally, connected with Cambodians straight away as they made me return to feel the human warmth. The biggest problem between us is the communication, and I don't only mean the language, but also the culture, education, life style and life experience differences. <p>Day after day, spending time with them, I manage to learn basic Khemer that allowed me to be respected and get closer to the local community. </p>
<p>Khemer people have a strong attraction to the western lifestyle, leading by consumerism and fashion, and finding a balance between the new and the traditional side of the culture could be challenging.  </p>

The differences between the western and asian world are huge, as a tourist, one notice the various colours, smells and tastes immediately.

At the beginning all these differences disoriented me, but then I realised how this lifestyle allows people to share much more, the weather encourages people to be outdoors too, and not long after, I felt in love with the asian culture.   
I travelled around Southeast Asia for a while but when I went to Cambodia I felt my soul in peace....and my second visit to Cambodia resulted in a 10 years leasing!

Despite the differences, this place enchanted me, its people touched my heart while nature encountered me at every corner. I had discovered a new Ivano and I realised that I had a new mission. 
Nana, is one of those special persons I met over here, and certainly became one of the closest friends now. She's Cambodian, works in a restaurant now and she will be the person who will manage our shop when this project will be finished and the business running. 
Oun Nim,  she's a sweet and clever little girl (photo), being only two years old she conquered my heart. Her parents are a wonderful young couple who helped me to set ground for this project, connecting me with the right people and their family and friends, smiling people that live life in a really easy way without sadness and silly frustrations.




My project aims to create a place that allows me and likeminded people to escape the consumerist world and return to a healthy and simple way of living.
My will is to build an eco-sustainable house to rent and two small shops, made from local and recycled materials from the existing structure in the land (photo) using everithing is possible from the ""old house"" where ""the grandfather"" lived for the last 10 years. Now he is over 80 years old and he moved into his dougther's house, in his honor I designed ""the villa"" trying to remind as much as possible the memory of the ""old house"".

Cintia my partner is involved too to support me and give me some advices when I lost the track. She's my smile, my tears and my eyes.

This house will be perfectly located, 500 meters from the best Cambodian beach and in the middle of a small local town surrounded by tropical nature. 

The house will have 3 floors and will respect the look of the local wooden houses, although it will have a concrete foundation to make it a long-lasting structure.

</div></div>","Julesy's BnB (Malta), in the Mediterranean 
Hi, I'm Julie Culley. My partner Glen Jones and I opened a tourism business in Malta, called Julesy's BnB in January 2015. We're running this Indiegogo campaign to expand our business.
We'd love for you to be part of our adventure, so we're offering fantastic deals on accommodation in Malta, which you will see on the right.
We're Australians from Adelaide, South Australia, in our 40s who've grown tired of the rat race. We bought a historic house of character in Malta (c1750), and we've ditched our careers to give people an outstanding 5-Star stay away from their home in the historic Three Cities region, 10 minutes across the Grand Harbour from Valletta (the Capital city) by ferry. Check us out on TripAdvisor and get one of our Perks, and you'll see exactly what we mean!

Glen's mother (Josie) was born in Malta and immigrated to Australia with her parents and siblings in 1955. Malta was a much different country back then, still under the British Empire and struggling from the aftermath of WWII. Sixty years on, Malta is now 'the' place to be in Europe (and some say the world), with over 1.6M tourists (excluding up to 5 cruise liners everyday) visiting this tiny Mediterranean island every year.

Malta, an archipelago in the central Mediterranean lies between Sicily and the North African coast, is a nation known for historic sites related to a succession of rulers including the Romans, Moors, Knights of St. John, French and British. It has numerous fortresses and megalithic temples dating to 3600 B.C.E. With 300+ sunny days a year.

We adore Malta's rich history, culture and architecture. But more importantly the Maltese people are so welcoming and friendly.Julesy's BnB offers our guests a whole series of excursions and tours, and ensures our guests get the very best out of Malta during their stay with us. Foodies can also participate and enjoy a gastronomic experience with Julesy's Kitchen too.


Our B&B is best described as a 5-Star luxury boutique hotel, with personalised service. Our mission is to exceed our guests expectations and make them part of our family. The issue is the ""boutique"" part, whereby we only have 2 guest rooms available and run at around a 95% occupancy rate. In fact, we turn away far more business than we can take.



Our business plan, market research, competitive analysis and operating plan are all in place and in full swing. We just desperately need to expand! The only way to grow the business is to acquire an adjoining house and link the two properties together.


What We NeedWe need to buy the adjoining house and refit the property to our standard. There is room to put in an in-ground pool for our guest's enjoyment as well. Our existing property is all complete, albeit Julesy's Kitchen urgently needs to be fitted out with a semi-commercial kitchen, so I can conduct my cooking school. The adjoining property will provide an additional 6 guest rooms, all with ensuite bathrooms. As you can imagine there's a lot of money required to restore and fit-out a house of this magnitude. A lift with complete disabled access to all rooms and ensuites will also be incorporated.
We'd love to launch our expansion with no debt, so we're looking to raise €330,000 (around USD$360,000)
We're confident that we will reach our goal. But, if we don't, all funds from our campaign will still  go to the expansion project. We will then supplement the balance with traditional funding.


What you get by contributing

Contributions will get you updates through various platforms. You can select from a 25% genuine discount off our room rates, up to a completely FREE stay with us at Julesy's BnB, with a whole host of tours and a hire car included.

The Impact

A contribution to the success of our campaign will have several impacts.
We have secured financing to complete our project, but a successful Indiegogo campaign will mean no borrowing. It will also allow us to showcase our beautiful property to more international guests and give our guests a great memorable experience.
For the village of Cospicua in theThree Cities where Julesy's BnB is located, it will mean economic development because we will be using all local supplies and services including contractors, construction products and labour.

However the tourism market in Malta over the last 3 years has grown by over 7-8%, and it seems there is no letting up. 


Challenges
Establishing a business in our new country hasn't been easy, but Glen and I are up to the challenge of having more guests to look after. We are also both about to commence learning the Maltese language, as our local neighbours will appreciate us fitting in more with them.
We've assembled a great team in Malta, including a project manager, legal and business agents, a great architect, a dedicated contractor, several trusted advisers, and marketing experts. We're also getting good support from local officials in the Maltese government.

<p> I am developing a better in-car solution for my pets when we travel or just run errands around town together- at times it's too hot or cold to leave them in the car.  Also, my big guy, Gunnar sometimes gets nervous when I exit the car (he's the one in the video) and I worry about him so I rush through my stops just to get back to the van. </p>
<p></p>We currently have 2 <b>dogs</b>, 1 <b>cat</b>, and 1 <b>horse.  </b>
</div><div>
<b><br/></b><p>Here's the solution I'm asking you to help develop with me:  <b>Mobile Pet Monitor</b></p> <ul> <li>
<b>Cellular camera</b> inside your vehicle.</li> <li>Allows you to <b>see &amp; talk with your pet(s)</b> when traveling or running errands together and you need to leave the vehicle.</li>
<li>Provides a constant virtual presence in your absence.</li> <li>
<b>Remote starts your car </b>from anywhere and keeps it running with the app.</li>
<li>Ensures safer pet traveling.</li>
<li>People we've interviewed who live in Metropolitan areas stated they would use it so simple ""<b>watch their car</b>"" as it was parked in the city ramp or lot.</li>
<li>Secondarily, this device is a <b>theft deterrent</b> since it has the ability to take a photo of anyone who breaks into your vehicle.</li>
<li>It has a clean and simple design and an even simpler app to run.  I personally struggle with computers and the whole ""Internet of Things/Connectivity"" so I'm developing it such that <b>if I can work it, anyone can</b>. (Yup, you guessed it, I'm guiding my computer folks to keep it as simple as it sounds.)</li>
</ul>If you're the kind of person who believes as I do, that pets are family and when you go places together you want them to be safe and comfortable while you're apart, then I'm asking you to join me and be a part of the revolution of making this world a better place for the ""other"" members of our family.<ul>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Okay, here is the evolution/hurdles of Mobile Pet Monitor:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 2014- realized what I thought was a weakness (lack of computer skills) was really one of my <b>greatest strengths</b> (I can keep it simple and straight-forward such that if it's simple for me, it is simple for most Americans).</li>
<li>January 2015: attended CES in Las Vegas to see if anyone else was developing a similar product.  No one has this idea on their radar right now.</li>
<li>January 2015: started a business (OhZ) to develop Mobile Pet Monitor.</li>
<li>Finding the right people (wireless/product development, App, and Optics firms) took several months as I did not know the industry nor who was really good at what they did along with good people to work with.</li>
<li>Currently have the development team in place and the process has started.</li>
<li>Funding is the next hurdle, to date it is being self funded.</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Being part of the birth of this device is not limited just to financing.</p>
<p>If you believe that this is a great cause for the animals in your lives but right now might not be the right time to financially contribute, <b>""spreading the word""</b> is equally as valuable.</p>

</div></div>","Mobile Pet Monitor Howdy, I'm Karen and  I believe animals aren't just pets, they're part of the family!  
 I am developing a better in-car solution for my pets when we travel or just run errands around town together- at times it's too hot or cold to leave them in the car.  Also, my big guy, Gunnar sometimes gets nervous when I exit the car (he's the one in the video) and I worry about him so I rush through my stops just to get back to the van. 
We currently have 2 dogs, 1 cat, and 1 horse.  

Here's the solution I'm asking you to help develop with me:  Mobile Pet Monitor  
Cellular camera inside your vehicle. Allows you to see & talk with your pet(s) when traveling or running errands together and you need to leave the vehicle.
Provides a constant virtual presence in your absence. 
Remote starts your car from anywhere and keeps it running with the app.
Ensures safer pet traveling.
People we've interviewed who live in Metropolitan areas stated they would use it so simple ""watch their car"" as it was parked in the city ramp or lot.
Secondarily, this device is a theft deterrent since it has the ability to take a photo of anyone who breaks into your vehicle.
It has a clean and simple design and an even simpler app to run.  I personally struggle with computers and the whole ""Internet of Things/Connectivity"" so I'm developing it such that if I can work it, anyone can. (Yup, you guessed it, I'm guiding my computer folks to keep it as simple as it sounds.)
If you're the kind of person who believes as I do, that pets are family and when you go places together you want them to be safe and comfortable while you're apart, then I'm asking you to join me and be a part of the revolution of making this world a better place for the ""other"" members of our family.
 





  Why $168,000? Since I'm asking you to be a part of this I believe you have a right to know why $168,500 (plus my Mom always told me, ""honesty is the best policy,"" and I'm not going to disappoint her).  
Here's the breakdown of the finances to get this product running sooner rather than later:  Component Selection (guts for the camera & in-car charger): $7,500 Custom Basic Enclosure (outer shell & charger): $2,500 Firmware Development (making camera, charger and vehicle all talk with each  other via iOS and Android): $108,500
Mobile App Development (iOS and Android): $50,000
Total: $168,500
Estimated cost for a single unit will be $399.
Additional monthly cellular charge estimated to be $10-20/unit.

    
Perks:


$10- Founder: part of team Mobile Pet Monitor, sincere thanks, name on Founders Page of website.

$25- Founder Plus Pet: Part of team Mobile Pet Monitor, your name on Founders Page of website, PLUS a picture of your pet immortalized on Founders Page.

$50- Founder Plus AND Commemorative Wooden Coin



$100- Founder Plus AND Commemorative Metal Coin


$299- Early Bird Special

$569- Two Car Starter Pack



Why Be Part of Mobile Pet Monitor Development? 
Make a huge difference in the safety and comfort of your pets when together in the car, which in turn allows you to be with them more.

Life is always improved for the better when pets are around us.  

Pets give unconditional love and this lets you give some of that back.

There's nothing better after a hard day than coming home and being greeted  by pets, wagging their tails and so happy to see you- no matter what!

Animals provide protection for the family. 
I know my pets would lay down their lives to ensure no harm would ever happen to my little boy. As a parent, I can never thank them enough for that peace of mind.



Risks & Challenges Okay, here is the evolution/hurdles of Mobile Pet Monitor:

November 2014- realized what I thought was a weakness (lack of computer skills) was really one of my greatest strengths (I can keep it simple and straight-forward such that if it's simple for me, it is simple for most Americans).
January 2015: attended CES in Las Vegas to see if anyone else was developing a similar product.  No one has this idea on their radar right now.
January 2015: started a business (OhZ) to develop Mobile Pet Monitor.
Finding the right people (wireless/product development, App, and Optics firms) took several months as I did not know the industry nor who was really good at what they did along with good people to work with.
Currently have the development team in place and the process has started.
Funding is the next hurdle, to date it is being self funded.

    
Other Ways You Can Help Being part of the birth of this device is not limited just to financing.
If you believe that this is a great cause for the animals in your lives but right now might not be the right time to financially contribute, ""spreading the word"" is equally as valuable.

<p><b>I am dedicated to creating a chef-friendly kitchen surrounded by a modest

away in a tranquil green space with a spectacular view of Mt. Hood. and the paradise that is 
Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p><b>There comes a time in one’s life as the years roll by when living that life may become a

me in this Indiegogo campaign and you will in</b> <b>turn allow this to happen.</b> This good fortune 
life has afforded me will be that much more rewarding when this sharing takes place. The satisfaction I receive cooking for 
friends and family is the same as most food lovers experience. I have been involved the world of food for 
more than 40 years. First as an apprentice cook in a San Francisco Bay-Area French restaurant, Le Tonneau and then serving as 
an executive chef at many food industry places. <b>Finally at my own restaurant Belinda’s in </b>
<b>Portland, Oregon.  And while there i was fortunate to serve many lovers of fine food and wines from around the globe.</b></p><p> Subsequently I was a food industry consultant and a general manager/chef 
for many different types of food ventures. <b>Now is my time to live in a quiet home, in</b>
<b>this case a mobile home in an older established park, surrounded by nature, </b>
<b>magnifies the 'quality of life' factor for me that is so important when time continues to

<p><b>I will keep everyone involved with social media messages and

another food fact that ends up making cooking more fun or an easier activity and i plan to share within these pages.. 
Recipes that I have found to be excellent ones in the past, consequently well 
received, along with ones new to me I want to share many of those too. There will be comments and observations by friends that 
are chefs, cooks in restaurants and hotels, avid home cooks.......plus some of my food-lover 
friends that want to contribute and share to make this journey more interesting.</p>
<p><b>I hope you will consider joining all the folks who would like to

<p> The number one thing I am looking forward to doing

<p><b>I offer this quote that say to myself quite often.</b>

<li> </li> <li>The magnitude of meeting the goal set forth in this campaign will not only allow 2 vets and a limo to provide transportation for the active heroes organization; taking veterans from the VA hospital to the local Veteran retreat, but allow us to provide the transportation needs that are here in Louisville Kentucky and all over the United States. I foresee this company growing and there are long term goals in place and ideas that noone else is doing. If you are still reading this than I will explain a little further. If you are a Veteran or a family member of one or most likely you know a Veteran, than you know that Yellow cab company is at every post in the United states. They currently are monopolizing the transportation business on posts.

Now in no way am i representing all soldiers opinions or saying that yellow cab is not safe as I have rode with them many times and soldiers ride with them every day. I am simply saying that there is room for another transportation service. I want to put luxury sedans and 15 passenger vans wrapped in different branch of services camouflage vinyl. Put a local unemployed Army National Guard soldiers in a suit and put him in as the driver.

bringing this important project to fruition. </div>
<div><h3>The Impact </h3></div>
<div>
<p>Women and their families in Yolo and most surrounding Counties currently have no options to give birth in a freestanding birth center. Midwife-led care at birth centers is one path to improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. A community birth center in Yolo County will profoundly expand much desired options for women and their families. Midwife-led freestanding birth centers are safe, cost-effective, and well-accepted alternatives to hospital delivery for physiologic management of birth in low-risk healthy women. </p>
<p>Freestanding birth centers have become an integral part to mainstream maternity care. Professional maternity care organizations such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) support birth centers as a safe option for low risk women. Furthermore, the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) the National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM), and the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) all support birth centers as a safe option for healthy women choosing natural childbirth. </p>

<h3>Our Mission </h3>

<p>Midwives of Yolo County Birth and Women's Health will be a licensed and accredited freestanding facility.

<p>Our goal is to provide accessible, empowering, client centered care, while ensuring the health and safety of mothers and babies.

<p><b>What

<p>
The Compassionate Vendor Program is in jeopardy of stalling completely. There

<p>50% to cover 7 months of overhead </p>
<p>10% for the National ADA (Amer. with
Disabilities Act) Symposium in Denver, CO.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458262159/jv0scevx3m7elpdn7qu3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>

<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Shipping/ Postage costs</p>
<p>Why include the Natl. ADA Symposium?</p>
<p>As a vendor at the symposium C.V.P.
will gain fantastic exposure by government agencies from across the country.
These agencies employ customer service representatives for a number of their
services (from public utility departments to parking enforcement and almost
every other public department in between).</p>
<p>Booth rental alone is $800, not to
mention all of our marketing material, signage, and travel costs. </p>
<p> ** If we are lucky enough to earn
more than our request of $36,000.00, anything beyond will go toward creating more of 
our infrastructure. Creating job/s, employing more marketing tactics, working
toward national media recognition, etc. </p>
<p>The Compassionate Vendor Program
launch and growth is a marathon not a sprint. </p>
<p><b>
Featured Perk (of 3): </b></p>
<p>If you donate $35.00 or more you will receive an “I
Support” lapel pin. These pins are exclusive to our Indiegogo campaign and can
only be obtained through your contribution here. It’s like a Secret Society
Decoder Pin of your very own (reference to <i>A
Christmas Story</i>, intended). </p>
<p><b><i><u>Your lapel pin declares to the world:</u></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I believe that all abilities are beautiful.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support love regardless of abilities.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support a more inclusive community for ALL.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support seeing the value in each and every member of our
society.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support disability education for customer service
representatives of every industry.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support a new, radical, expectation of customer service.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support progress.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support compassion and kindness for that is how we are
going to change the world, together.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I support shifting the cultural shame and stigmas
surrounding people with disabilities wherever possible, through global
education.</i></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>If we cannot generate capital the Compassionate
Vendor Program will be all but dead in the water. We cannot continue working on
this as we have without some revenue. We are a small team of a CEO and a few
interns that are committed to this global movement, but if we don’t have the
money to sustain our needs and begin to create the infrastructure to support
this platform, C.V.P. will never get off of its feet. </p>
<p>Once we can sustain ourselves (for at least a few
months at a time) we continue to do what we have been doing, reaching out to
agencies, school districts, and corporations (through their ever present
gate-keepers) to introduce this program, physically pounding the pavement to local
businesses with brochures in hand, and attending Meet The Buyer government
events (can we say C.V.P. certification for all DMV offices?) that always
require travel to get to them, and network network network, beginning locally
so as to keep costs as low as possible; just to name a few ways.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of the hard work, we are afraid
that we will have to abandon the mission before it can really begin. And that,
would break our hearts.</p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand that some are simply unable to
contribute to our campaign monetarily, but that doesn’t mean that you are not
valuable to our vision and mission. Our love for you is not
conditional. </p>
<p>Please make noise about our campaign via your
networks, your Socials, your personal relationships, on your blogs, using the
Indiegogo share tools, or simply screaming it from the mountaintop. We often
say around here, <b><i>how can we change the
world if the world doesn’t know we exist?</i></b></p>
<p>The Compassionate Vendor Program is a radical new idea;
it’s never been done before, which is exhilarating and terrifying all at the
same time. How do we get C.V.P. to catch fire? YOU can help us fan the flames.
YOU can be on the ground floor of a global movement. </p>
<p>Together, we here at Team C.V.P. wholly believe that
we can change the world to a more inclusive and compassionate global community
for <i>all</i> of us. </p>
<p>This truly is a <b><i>Movement to Change the World</i></b>.</p>

Bringing education, complete with practical tips and techniques easy to use when interacting with customers, on how to best serve those with unseen disabilities to customer service representatives will create a more inclusive, compassionate, and welcoming community for every one. For more information on C.V.P.'s creator/CEO and the program itself, please visit www.CVPGlobal.comUnseen disabilities focused on in each training include
but are not limited to:
·  Autism Spectrum Disorder
·  P.T.S.D.
·  Alzheimer’s/Dementia
·  Other mental and sensory
disabilities (all mainly “invisible”)
With certification
of each establishment comes:​
·  A C.V.P. window decal to display on your
front door, proudly announcing to customers your investment in inclusive
service to the community
·  Each employee that attends a training will receive
a C.V.P. lapel pin to wear while at work
·  C.V.P. Table tents/table signage 
·  Each business is listed for three years (the length of the active
certification) on the CPGlobal.com online directory (no additional cost). 

What
We Need & What You Get
We need MONEY! in order for C.V.P. to launch successfully.

The Compassionate Vendor Program is in jeopardy of stalling completely. There
is not enough cash flow at this time to support the full time position required to
fully launch C.V.P. into the world. 
A breakdown of our current needs:
40% staffing costs 
50% to cover 7 months of overhead 
10% for the National ADA (Amer. with
Disabilities Act) Symposium in Denver, CO.

Our monthly overhead includes:
·  Office space
·  Insurance
·  Web services
·  Accounting
·  Marketing consultant
·  Utilities
·  Transportation for pitches
·  Marketing material
·  Printing costs
·  Shipping/ Postage costs
Why include the Natl. ADA Symposium?
As a vendor at the symposium C.V.P.
will gain fantastic exposure by government agencies from across the country.
These agencies employ customer service representatives for a number of their
services (from public utility departments to parking enforcement and almost
every other public department in between).
Booth rental alone is $800, not to
mention all of our marketing material, signage, and travel costs. 
 ** If we are lucky enough to earn
more than our request of $36,000.00, anything beyond will go toward creating more of 
our infrastructure. Creating job/s, employing more marketing tactics, working
toward national media recognition, etc. 
The Compassionate Vendor Program
launch and growth is a marathon not a sprint. 

Featured Perk (of 3): 
If you donate $35.00 or more you will receive an “I
Support” lapel pin. These pins are exclusive to our Indiegogo campaign and can
only be obtained through your contribution here. It’s like a Secret Society
Decoder Pin of your very own (reference to A
Christmas Story, intended). 
Your lapel pin declares to the world:
I believe that all abilities are beautiful.
I support love regardless of abilities.
I support a more inclusive community for ALL.
I support seeing the value in each and every member of our
society.
I support disability education for customer service
representatives of every industry.
I support a new, radical, expectation of customer service.
I support progress.
I support compassion and kindness for that is how we are
going to change the world, together.
I support shifting the cultural shame and stigmas
surrounding people with disabilities wherever possible, through global
education.

Risks
& Challenges
If we cannot generate capital the Compassionate
Vendor Program will be all but dead in the water. We cannot continue working on
this as we have without some revenue. We are a small team of a CEO and a few
interns that are committed to this global movement, but if we don’t have the
money to sustain our needs and begin to create the infrastructure to support
this platform, C.V.P. will never get off of its feet. 
Once we can sustain ourselves (for at least a few
months at a time) we continue to do what we have been doing, reaching out to
agencies, school districts, and corporations (through their ever present
gate-keepers) to introduce this program, physically pounding the pavement to local
businesses with brochures in hand, and attending Meet The Buyer government
events (can we say C.V.P. certification for all DMV offices?) that always
require travel to get to them, and network network network, beginning locally
so as to keep costs as low as possible; just to name a few ways.
We are not afraid of the hard work, we are afraid
that we will have to abandon the mission before it can really begin. And that,
would break our hearts.
Other
Ways You Can Help
We understand that some are simply unable to
contribute to our campaign monetarily, but that doesn’t mean that you are not
valuable to our vision and mission. Our love for you is not
conditional. 
Please make noise about our campaign via your
networks, your Socials, your personal relationships, on your blogs, using the
Indiegogo share tools, or simply screaming it from the mountaintop. We often
say around here, how can we change the
world if the world doesn’t know we exist?
The Compassionate Vendor Program is a radical new idea;
it’s never been done before, which is exhilarating and terrifying all at the
same time. How do we get C.V.P. to catch fire? YOU can help us fan the flames.
YOU can be on the ground floor of a global movement. 
Together, we here at Team C.V.P. wholly believe that
we can change the world to a more inclusive and compassionate global community
for all of us.

<p><b>WHAT IS LIFE SHELL?</b></p>
<p>The life shell is a inflatable  craft that can easily be deployed  from any structure including skyscrapers or airplanes for emergency escape and rescue in case of accidents, natural disasters, destructive fires, tsunamis and even in the case of terrorist attacks. Life Shell can protect people in case of building collapse thanks to its impact resistance and heat protective properties.</p>
<p><b>HOW DOES IT WORKS ? </b></p>
<p>CLASS IV BULLETPROOF (LiquidArmor )<br/></p>
<p> A special LiquidArmor ( Non-Newtonian Treated Kevlar ) helps absorb the impact and reduce or stop penetration to the body from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">firearm</a>-fired projectiles and shrapnel from explosions.<br/></p>
<p>IMPACT/SHOCK ABSORBENT ( Kevlar, Zylon lining, Airbags, QR Parachute)</p>
<p>This invention utilize a combination of non-newtonian fluids technology along with Kevlar airbags that allows the life shell to be shock resistant for high altitude drops and high pressures due to high force impacts . Additionally a quick release parachute is utilized in case of high altitude drops to slow down accidental fast acceleration and ultimately guarantee a safe descent .</p>

<p>The inner shell has a main entrance, a sealing door, an air tight surviving area, after impact floating airbags, air emergency supplies, safety seats and belts, frontal impact protective  cushions, fire extinguisher, gps locator, on board computer, communication systems and water and surviving supplies . </p>
<p>The outer layer of the inner shell is made of Kevlar lined with polyethylene and special dust (non-newtonian fluid mixture) to make it impact and puncture resistant. The non Newtonian fluid properties protect the inner area also from heat and deformation from impact.</p>
<p>The life shell is also designed to float and keep the inhabitants safe in case of ocean surges and tsunamis.</p>
<p><b>The Outer Shell</b></p>
<p>It contains the inner shell and has an anchor point to grip to mount and releases mechanisms. It holds gas tanks for external airbags, the external airbags, mounting springs to inner shell. On this shell we have cameras feeding wirelessly to the inner shell.</p>
<p><b>HELP US HELP BUILD A SAFER WORLD</b></p>
<p>After 5 years spent in collecting technical data and executing research studies in collaboration with SACEMP Engineering Ltd we are closer than ever to make the life shell project a reality. We are raising money to build a prototype and test it so that we can possibly consider a market pilot in 2018. </p>
<p><b>WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR ?</b></p>
<p>I'm asking for $50’000 to build a prototype of a new emergency rescue craft concept. </p>
<div>
<b>THE MAKING OF THE LIFESHELL POD </b>

<div>The money raised will go  into the manufacturing of prototype including material, mold and casting creation. <p></p>
<p><b>ON BOARD ELECTRONICS BY INTEL EDISON</b></p>
<p>A small portion will go into hardware and software development for airbags and shoots release synchronization. A particular thanks to Intel Edison platform that enable us to lower our over all development costs . <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/lgqbb8t"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/lgqbb8t</a></p>
<h3>WILL IT WORK? HOW CAN THIS DEFY THE LAW OF PHYSICS?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is possible for it to work and no, it does not defy the laws of physics. Most of the work is done by the on-board high speed computing synchronization system and sensors. </p>
<p>One of the essential elements for this technology to work is the exact timing and sequence in which each element is deployed during release and landing. Very similar by comparison on how ABS, Airbag and automated safety systems work on cars. Just bit more complexed. Also to adopt lift gasses and high efficiency and quick release best-of-class parachutes have a huge impact on the overall functionality of the system. </p>
<p>The latest development in terms of materials also plays a key role. The utilization of dilatant Non-Newtonian fluids in conjunction with Kevlar, Zylon and CNF materials have resulted in optimized distribution of force along the entire structure and allow best shock absorption during landing and ultimatelly avoid hot-spots upon impact.</p>
<p> The introduction of SEAgel Hydrogen based foam has been also extremely important for optimal thermal insulation and make Life Shell fire resistant. Being SEAgel lighter than air also allows for overall weight to be reduced and improve floating and gliding capabilities.</p>

A BRIEF INTRODUCTIONThe world's cities are sprouting with plans for new towers and skyscrapers, a sign of twin booms in creativity and wealth. But many people still have concerns for safety & survival  in case of emergency.

 
GENERAL APPLICATION 


IN CASE OF PUBLIC SHOOTING, LIFE SHELL BULLET PROOF KEVLAR TECHNOLOGY OFFERS SHELTER AND RELIABLE PROTECTION.
Think about all of the public places you go in and out of each day - churches, schools, stadiums, theaters or libraries. They're all places that attract a large volume of people but also go relatively unprotected.
Life Shell capsules can be installed in this vulnerable places to offer protection until law enforcement authorities arrives to the rescue.
This technology implementation could also act as a deterrent for criminal individuals wanting to do harm in a peaceful community.
Motivated by the latest news of shocking earthquake and natural disasters around the world we thought of a device that can potentially save thousands of lives and avoid casualties.




MILITARY APPLICATION
Life shell can offer protection to soldiers if overwhelmed or isolated during military operation. It can be deployed and offer bullet proof protection, while under enemy fire, to soldier/s waiting for reinforcements  or extraction.






HUMANITARIAN APPLICATION
Life Shell can offer bullet proof protection to rescuers and refugees during humanitarian operation in war territories in case of ambushes from aggressors. It can guarantee protection while broadcast emergency rescue calls to authorities and initiate military rescue intervention.




NATURAL DISASTERS PROTECTION APPLICATION
This project aims ultimately to build a prototype and test the next generation of emergency and rescue crafts. This technology offers emergency aerial to ground protection for people in a crisis situation, similar by comparison to  what life rafts provide for people in shipwrecks at sea.

LET'S GET PREPARED. A natural disaster of titanic proportions is overdue to strike the U.S., physicist Michio Kaku warns.

Thailand Tsunami 2004
JAPAN EARTHQUAKE & TSUNAMI 2011

EXTENDED TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION FOR AVIATION SAFETY
Life shell technology could potentially be used for emergency escape or embedded into modern airplane architecture to provide extra level of protection to passengers in case of emergency and crash landing . Lining the fuselage with Kevlar and non newtonian fluid mixture would help the structure stay intact and not brake off in peaces while offering protection to passengers from fire related injuries. Airbags and crash sensor could help passengers also avoid injuries during crash landing.




EXTENDED TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION FOR SHIP'S SAFETY
It is very common for a ship to lean on one side before sinking making it impossible to lower life boats and life rafts  during abandon ship emergencies. Life shell technology could potentially solve this issue and guarantee emergency escape in any circumstances.


WHAT IS LIFE SHELL?
The life shell is a inflatable  craft that can easily be deployed  from any structure including skyscrapers or airplanes for emergency escape and rescue in case of accidents, natural disasters, destructive fires, tsunamis and even in the case of terrorist attacks. Life Shell can protect people in case of building collapse thanks to its impact resistance and heat protective properties.
HOW DOES IT WORKS ? 
CLASS IV BULLETPROOF (LiquidArmor )
 A special LiquidArmor ( Non-Newtonian Treated Kevlar ) helps absorb the impact and reduce or stop penetration to the body from firearm-fired projectiles and shrapnel from explosions.
IMPACT/SHOCK ABSORBENT ( Kevlar, Zylon lining, Airbags, QR Parachute)
This invention utilize a combination of non-newtonian fluids technology along with Kevlar airbags that allows the life shell to be shock resistant for high altitude drops and high pressures due to high force impacts . Additionally a quick release parachute is utilized in case of high altitude drops to slow down accidental fast acceleration and ultimately guarantee a safe descent .


A dilatant Non- Newtonian fluid provides protection, as well as material flexibility.The inner lining of the life shell is composed of freely moving molecules however, upon impact the molecules bind together turning the soft putty into a solid block barrier.

HEAT RESISTANT / FIRE PROTECTIVE ( Zylon , SEAgel )
SEAgel (Safe Emulsion Agar gel) is one of a class of high-tech foam materials known as aerogels. It is an excellent thermal insulator . This material is used to line the inner and outer layers of the Life Shell craft to enable it to withstand fire and be heat resistant. Also the Zylon material used on outer layers and airbags act as additional level of thermal insulation and protection from fire.

THERMAL INSULATED / INFLATABLE SNOW SHELTER ( Zylon Buffer Layers ) 



FLOATING LIFE RESCUE SHELL ( Safe Emulsion Nitrogen Agar Gel )
SEAgel (Safe Emulsion Agar gel) can be made lighter than air using hydrogen - causing it to float or hang in the air. It insulates against temperature, noise, and electric current. SEAgel is also completely biodegradable, as it is made entirely of biological material and can even be eaten.
 
INFLATABLE, EASY TO STORE & EASY TO DEPLOY ( Inflatable )
Life Shell prototype will consist of a single seater inflatable sphere shaped pod.  Having said that, there are no limitations for this technology  in future application and development. 
The inflatable property of Life Shell Pod makes it extremely compact, easy to store and deploy in case of emergency.


           



THE MAKING OF LIFE SHELL PROTOTYPE, BASIC REQUIREMENTS, SKETCHES




Inner Seats



Inner Airbags



Inner Shell




Inner Shell - Sealed Door




Lift Gas Unit & Deployed Outer Airbags 
Quick Release Parachute 




The Inner Shell
The inner shell has a main entrance, a sealing door, an air tight surviving area, after impact floating airbags, air emergency supplies, safety seats and belts, frontal impact protective  cushions, fire extinguisher, gps locator, on board computer, communication systems and water and surviving supplies . 
The outer layer of the inner shell is made of Kevlar lined with polyethylene and special dust (non-newtonian fluid mixture) to make it impact and puncture resistant. The non Newtonian fluid properties protect the inner area also from heat and deformation from impact.
The life shell is also designed to float and keep the inhabitants safe in case of ocean surges and tsunamis.
The Outer Shell
It contains the inner shell and has an anchor point to grip to mount and releases mechanisms. It holds gas tanks for external airbags, the external airbags, mounting springs to inner shell. On this shell we have cameras feeding wirelessly to the inner shell.
HELP US HELP BUILD A SAFER WORLD
After 5 years spent in collecting technical data and executing research studies in collaboration with SACEMP Engineering Ltd we are closer than ever to make the life shell project a reality. We are raising money to build a prototype and test it so that we can possibly consider a market pilot in 2018. 
WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR ?
I'm asking for $50’000 to build a prototype of a new emergency rescue craft concept. 

THE MAKING OF THE LIFESHELL POD 

The money raised will go  into the manufacturing of prototype including material, mold and casting creation. 
ON BOARD ELECTRONICS BY INTEL EDISON
A small portion will go into hardware and software development for airbags and shoots release synchronization. A particular thanks to Intel Edison platform that enable us to lower our over all development costs . http://tinyurl.com/lgqbb8t
WILL IT WORK? HOW CAN THIS DEFY THE LAW OF PHYSICS?
Yes, it is possible for it to work and no, it does not defy the laws of physics. Most of the work is done by the on-board high speed computing synchronization system and sensors. 
One of the essential elements for this technology to work is the exact timing and sequence in which each element is deployed during release and landing. Very similar by comparison on how ABS, Airbag and automated safety systems work on cars. Just bit more complexed. Also to adopt lift gasses and high efficiency and quick release best-of-class parachutes have a huge impact on the overall functionality of the system. 
The latest development in terms of materials also plays a key role. The utilization of dilatant Non-Newtonian fluids in conjunction with Kevlar, Zylon and CNF materials have resulted in optimized distribution of force along the entire structure and allow best shock absorption during landing and ultimatelly avoid hot-spots upon impact.
 The introduction of SEAgel Hydrogen based foam has been also extremely important for optimal thermal insulation and make Life Shell fire resistant. Being SEAgel lighter than air also allows for overall weight to be reduced and improve floating and gliding capabilities.

delicious cheesecake ganache. Well, dream no more! Cherry Bomb Café will bring
you this and many more creative and original ideas that you’ve probably never
seen before.</p>
<p>My name is Clyde Allen, or so that’s
what my mom would call me when I was in trouble as a youngster. I’ve been in
the restaurant business for the last 25 years. As an artist and entrepreneur,
it was only a natural progression for me to become a chocolatier. After all,
food IS art and if I didn’t learn to “create” something in that amount of time

<h3>Goals</h3> <p></p>
<p>Of course, top priority is to create
magnificent original foods &amp; drinks for you and your loved ones but people keep <strike>asking</strike>
begging me to find a way to ship my cordial creations. Therefore, my main goal
is to develop shipping methods that allow us to ship these creations out to wherever
you are. To do that I have developed my own proprietary packaging for my
products because they are very fragile. Also, I need my own commercial space in
which to employ other talented chocolate artisans to create and fulfill these tasty treats for you. This is how Cherry Bomb Café will come to life.</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, for
Cherry Bomb Café to come to full fruition I need good folks like yourself to
choose one (or many) of my awesome perks above &amp; to the right and then click away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please keep in mind - I believe that Values-Based
Leadership by supporting other great causes is crucial to growing one's own
endeavors. Therefore, my charity of choice is the “Guide Dogs for the Blind” organization and I will be donating 3% of my portion of the funds to “Guide Dogs for the Blind”. I will also continue to make generous donations to them for as long as I breathe.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s an approximate breakdown of what the funds will go towards in the
intended order of disbursement:</p>
<ul>
<li>5% = of the gross number automatically goes to Indiegogo.</li>
<li>3% = of the net remainder will go to “Guide Dogs for the Blind” .</li>
<li>$6K = Inventory
     Supplies - include all kitchen tools &amp; utensils, serving, delivery
     &amp; shipping containers, cleaning supplies and food products. I already
     have over $6K worth of inventory supplies for running my
      day to day chocolate and fruit arrangement business which I currently run from a
     leased 3<sup>rd</sup> party kitchen.</li>
<li>$20K =
     Projected Commercial Startup Rent, Utilities, Legal &amp; Insurance.</li>
<li>$25K = Projected
     Startup Payroll. </li>
<li>$10K =
     Marketing, Promotion &amp; Branding.</li>
<li>$10K-$45K = Equipment
     - includes walk-in refrigerator/freezer, undercounter refrigerator,
 display countertop fridges,
     ice machine, sinks, juicers &amp; blenders, chocolate machines: 
bean roasting (drum) oven, cocoa butter press, conching (milling) 
machine, tempering table, confectionary drum pan, enrober, fountains, 
and Point of Sale System. I already own about
     $6K worth of restaurant equipment (steel tables, shelving, 
refrigerator
     cabinets, 3 chocolate tempering machines, a conveyor oven, a dough 
rolling
     machine, and a giant stand mixer).</li>
<li>$45K = Commercial
     Space Retrofit - includes design consultation, dining tables &amp; chairs,
     coffee lounge furniture, counter tops, signage, permits, contractors, freight, and installations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Now
you may be scratching your head thinking that this all seems to add up to more
than what my goal is and you’d be right. That’s because this is my first
crowdfund campaign and I’ve read from many sources that anything over $10K rarely
gets funded. My real number is closer to $150K-$200K to run everything top-notch. Therefore, I’m asking for the
bare-bones minimum (seed capital) to get into my own commercial space from
which to develop a successful &amp; robust shipping model and then I’ll apply
for a Small Business Loan with a few months of sales growth to show. Or I may
run an additional campaign, depending on how successful this one is. Also, this campaign is VERY short (only 12 days
total) because I’m trying to capture the expansive Valentine’s Day crowd which
is the specific target demographic to this kind of concept. Therefore, I’ve 
earmarked this campaign to be “InDemand” so that people can continuously contribute
to the growth of Cherry Bomb Café but. Please keep in mind, though, that we still have to reach the total campaign goal of $35K in order for the ""InDemand"" option to take effect after the campaign ends in 12 days.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Future Goals</h3> <p> </p>
<p>As this concept grows I will
inevitably branch out to additional locations and perhaps even eventually franchise.
To foster this kind of growth I will focus on large events such as weddings,
corporate events, festivals and trade shows. Having said that, I plan to host this
year and every year after, the “Austin Chocolate Festival” which was
previously hosted by my own mentor. <br/></p>
<p>That one has always been a great show! :) Thanks Steven!<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Please Share!<br/>
</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Please help get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li> <li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.

smoothie bar because I also specialize in fruit bouquets (see below), chocolate
dipped fruit, juices, smoothies . . . you get the picture. And what great
hangout, especially in Austin, is whole without an internet café style setting
complete with coffees, pastries, soups & sandwiches?Cherry Bomb Café will be a place in Austin TX where people can kick back have a coffee or tea, good
eats and some really unique treats. If you think an internet café & coffee shop combined with a juice & smoothie bar combined with a chocolate fountain bar is “weird” then you clearly haven’t been to
Austin TX yet. We welcome you soon! 
Goals 
Of course, top priority is to create
magnificent original foods & drinks for you and your loved ones but people keep asking
begging me to find a way to ship my cordial creations. Therefore, my main goal
is to develop shipping methods that allow us to ship these creations out to wherever
you are. To do that I have developed my own proprietary packaging for my
products because they are very fragile. Also, I need my own commercial space in
which to employ other talented chocolate artisans to create and fulfill these tasty treats for you. This is how Cherry Bomb Café will come to life.
In other words, for
Cherry Bomb Café to come to full fruition I need good folks like yourself to
choose one (or many) of my awesome perks above & to the right and then click away.
Please keep in mind - I believe that Values-Based
Leadership by supporting other great causes is crucial to growing one's own
endeavors. Therefore, my charity of choice is the “Guide Dogs for the Blind” organization and I will be donating 3% of my portion of the funds to “Guide Dogs for the Blind”. I will also continue to make generous donations to them for as long as I breathe.

Here’s an approximate breakdown of what the funds will go towards in the
intended order of disbursement:

5% = of the gross number automatically goes to Indiegogo.
3% = of the net remainder will go to “Guide Dogs for the Blind” .
$6K = Inventory
     Supplies - include all kitchen tools & utensils, serving, delivery
     & shipping containers, cleaning supplies and food products. I already
     have over $6K worth of inventory supplies for running my
      day to day chocolate and fruit arrangement business which I currently run from a
     leased 3rd party kitchen.
$20K =
     Projected Commercial Startup Rent, Utilities, Legal & Insurance.
$25K = Projected
     Startup Payroll. 
$10K =
     Marketing, Promotion & Branding.
$10K-$45K = Equipment
     - includes walk-in refrigerator/freezer, undercounter refrigerator,
 display countertop fridges,
     ice machine, sinks, juicers & blenders, chocolate machines: 
bean roasting (drum) oven, cocoa butter press, conching (milling) 
machine, tempering table, confectionary drum pan, enrober, fountains, 
and Point of Sale System. I already own about
     $6K worth of restaurant equipment (steel tables, shelving, 
refrigerator
     cabinets, 3 chocolate tempering machines, a conveyor oven, a dough 
rolling
     machine, and a giant stand mixer).
$45K = Commercial
     Space Retrofit - includes design consultation, dining tables & chairs,
     coffee lounge furniture, counter tops, signage, permits, contractors, freight, and installations.



Now
you may be scratching your head thinking that this all seems to add up to more
than what my goal is and you’d be right. That’s because this is my first
crowdfund campaign and I’ve read from many sources that anything over $10K rarely
gets funded. My real number is closer to $150K-$200K to run everything top-notch. Therefore, I’m asking for the
bare-bones minimum (seed capital) to get into my own commercial space from
which to develop a successful & robust shipping model and then I’ll apply
for a Small Business Loan with a few months of sales growth to show. Or I may
run an additional campaign, depending on how successful this one is. Also, this campaign is VERY short (only 12 days
total) because I’m trying to capture the expansive Valentine’s Day crowd which
is the specific target demographic to this kind of concept. Therefore, I’ve 
earmarked this campaign to be “InDemand” so that people can continuously contribute
to the growth of Cherry Bomb Café but. Please keep in mind, though, that we still have to reach the total campaign goal of $35K in order for the ""InDemand"" option to take effect after the campaign ends in 12 days.   Future Goals  
As this concept grows I will
inevitably branch out to additional locations and perhaps even eventually franchise.
To foster this kind of growth I will focus on large events such as weddings,
corporate events, festivals and trade shows. Having said that, I plan to host this
year and every year after, the “Austin Chocolate Festival” which was
previously hosted by my own mentor. 
That one has always been a great show! :) Thanks Steven!   Please Share!
 Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Please help get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. Please use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it. I'll keep everyone updated as things progress. Thanks in advance for any time and attention you may give this.Cordially yours,Clyde Allen DuBose

P.S.  You may have noticed that my logo at the top of this page doesn't say ""Cherry Bomb Café"". That's because ""Cordial Creations"" is the name of the catering style concept that I currently run it as. I will still use the same logo but just change the lettering to read ""Cherry Bomb Café"". You can read more about my cordial beginnings here ~ CherryBombCafe.com ~ where you can also check out my
proposed full menu. Or use the links below to find me.F.Y.I. You can already order
some items at CordialCreations.com (currently for delivery in the
Austin area only). I apologize to those who don’t live in the Austin area but
that is what this whole campaign is about – so that I may develop a model to
enable me, with the help of employees, to efficiently ship to you wherever you
are. Thanks for your contributions in advance and I hope to make it a great
holiday for everyone :)UPDATE: Mon. Feb. 3, 2016I just revamped my logo! :)Connect to me on Facebook and Twitter!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>RefCircle – A Job Network. Idea is to create a connected
world of employees from different organizations and different part of the
world. Many times, we ask our friends about the job in their organization. We
hardly get to know about the opportunities in our friends circle. Studies and

landing a job by 10 times. At the same time employees struggle to find a
profile or friend to refer them because they may not be aware if someone is
looking for a change or not. This is the idea behind RefCircle to provide a platform

<p><b>Tutorial:</b></p>
<p>Fandom Files is a new concept retail
book, comic book, and art store. Especially art.<span>  Specifically fan art. Our goal is to bring
new and exciting worlds within reach of community which all ready happens to
boast its own Comic Con and a healthy supportive nerdy community. We will host
any number of events and activities including but not limited to gaming tournaments
(Magic anyone?), cosplay competitions, book signings, artist signings, and
demonstrations.</span></p>
<p>I’d love to say that this would
better our whole community or the world but I can’t. This business will allow
me to join my husband in supporting our family. We will source local and small
scale artists as well as small businesses to help others thrive in their
businesses as well.</p>
<p>On a personal note, this business is
being opened by me and my husband.<span>  I am
a stay at home nerdtastic mom and my husband is a disabled veteran and public
servant. We have 4 young children (ages 9-2) ranging from exceedingly nerdy to
tough to tangle with. Our middle children were born with hearing loss which
makes life more interesting, which has presented us with unique challenges and
inspirations. This year I’m making them Blue Ear and Saphira (deaf superheros)
costumes for Halloween!</span></p>
<p>Contributing to making this dream a
reality may be small scale in relation to the world, but for my family and I
this changes our world for the better in countless ways.</p>
<p><b>Crafting Recipe </b></p>
<p>As you might imagine, getting a
store of any kind operational takes a bit of real effort and often a great deal
of money. This is our budget as it stands at the moment.<span>  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Website: $450 (this gets our website
up and running for a whole year)</p></li>
<li><p>Licensing: $200 (this gets us all
the licenses we need)</p></li>
<li><p>Getting Signs: $10,000 (this puts
our logo in a lit box on the front and back of the building as well as removing
the existing signs)</p></li>
<li><p>Location: $10,000 (covers the down
payment and the first 3 months of rent)</p></li>
<li><p>Shelving: $5000 (fairly obvious I
think, I can’t just pile all those wonderful books on the floor)</p></li>
<li><p>Furnishings: $8,000 (a proper book
store needs big comfy chairs to wallow in, and tables to display goods or set a
cup of coffee on as well as display cases for art and such fabulous things)</p></li>
<li><p>Stock: $30,000 (can’t open the store
without stock on the shelves)</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing: $10,000 (got to get our
name out there!!)</p></li>
<li><p>Point of Sales System: $500 (this
allows us the use of an accounting and inventory system for a year)</p></li>
<li><p>Computer: $850 (for all the digital
needs of a modern day business)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we
reach this goal we have an extended goal of $100,000 total so that we can add a
small tea and coffee area to the shop. This would not be such a big addition
but we’ll need to actually build a kitchen in our space and the majority of
that cost will go there.<span>  If we reach the
point where this campaign succeeds to that extent, then we will post and
updated budget with those details on it.</span></p>
<p><b>The
Loot!!</b></p>
<p>A few of
our perks, these are my favorites!</p>
<p>For a $5
contribution: A mention of thanks on our contributors wall which will be
present both on our website and in our store. Video game tomb stones have
always been one of my favorite little details, you pick your name and pithy
epitaph and we put it on our walls!</p>
<p>For a $25
contribution: you receive an amazing t-shirt with our logo on it, and get a
mention of thanks on our wall and website!</p>
<p>For a $100
contribution: you receive a mention on our wall and website, a logo sticker, a
t-shirt, a choice of one ticket to one special event (book signing, artist meet
and greets, demonstrations, etc), and an invitation to our Grand Opening which
will be as close to a real comic con as I can make it!</p>
<p>For a
$1,000 contribution: A Comic Con gift basket that will include 2 tickets to our
local Comic Con, and tons of other nerdy goodies, your choice of 2 special
event tickets, an invitation to our Grand Opening, plus a mention on our walls
and 10% off on all in store purchases for a year.</p>
<p>For a
$10,000 contribution: A party for you and your favorite 7 nerdy friends after
hours in our store, an invitation to our Grand Opening, your choice of 4
special event tickets, a mention on our walls, and a 20% off on all in store
purchases for a year. (Limited Quantities!) </p>
<p>If we don’t
reach the goal immediately whatever has been gathered will go towards putting
together a store, it will just take a little longer! All perks will be honored!</p>
<p><b>Who
this quest reaches:</b></p>
<p>As I said before, I wish I could say
that this project has an Earth shattering potential to improve the world but it
doesn’t. What it does have is world altering potential for my family. When
successful this business will give us independence. It will also give other
small businesses and artists a chance to live their dreams. </p>
<p>By contributing to this project you
contribute to a dream, a dream of independence and sharing our passions with
others and bringing joy and wonder to our community.</p>
<p><b>Petty
villains:</b></p>
<p>Our business is a simple one as retail
businesses go, the most difficult problem we foresee is finding local artists
that are interested in selling their work. Our local Comic Con will be an
incomparable resource in finding locals that want to share their work with
others, we will also be sourcing artists on platforms like Etsy and Deviant Art
because they are amazing and experienced in sharing their art with the world.</p>
<p>Another difficulty we may face could
be getting customers in the door, we will be using social networks such as
Facebook and Twitter to really share ourselves and our business with the world,
we will be attending the nearest Comic Cons to promote our store amongst a crowd
that is our primary market, we will be blogging about the store, the merchandise,
the art and artists, new products, and anything else that relates to our
business, and we will also be holding events in our store (gaming tournaments, cosplay
competitions, art and book signings, meet and greets, and art demonstrations to
name a few).</p>

</div></div>","Tutorial:
Fandom Files is a new concept retail
book, comic book, and art store. Especially art.  Specifically fan art. Our goal is to bring
new and exciting worlds within reach of community which all ready happens to
boast its own Comic Con and a healthy supportive nerdy community. We will host
any number of events and activities including but not limited to gaming tournaments
(Magic anyone?), cosplay competitions, book signings, artist signings, and
demonstrations.
I’d love to say that this would
better our whole community or the world but I can’t. This business will allow
me to join my husband in supporting our family. We will source local and small
scale artists as well as small businesses to help others thrive in their
businesses as well.
On a personal note, this business is
being opened by me and my husband.  I am
a stay at home nerdtastic mom and my husband is a disabled veteran and public
servant. We have 4 young children (ages 9-2) ranging from exceedingly nerdy to
tough to tangle with. Our middle children were born with hearing loss which
makes life more interesting, which has presented us with unique challenges and
inspirations. This year I’m making them Blue Ear and Saphira (deaf superheros)
costumes for Halloween!
Contributing to making this dream a
reality may be small scale in relation to the world, but for my family and I
this changes our world for the better in countless ways.
Crafting Recipe 
As you might imagine, getting a
store of any kind operational takes a bit of real effort and often a great deal
of money. This is our budget as it stands at the moment.  

Website: $450 (this gets our website
up and running for a whole year)
Licensing: $200 (this gets us all
the licenses we need)
Getting Signs: $10,000 (this puts
our logo in a lit box on the front and back of the building as well as removing
the existing signs)
Location: $10,000 (covers the down
payment and the first 3 months of rent)
Shelving: $5000 (fairly obvious I
think, I can’t just pile all those wonderful books on the floor)
Furnishings: $8,000 (a proper book
store needs big comfy chairs to wallow in, and tables to display goods or set a
cup of coffee on as well as display cases for art and such fabulous things)
Stock: $30,000 (can’t open the store
without stock on the shelves)
Marketing: $10,000 (got to get our
name out there!!)
Point of Sales System: $500 (this
allows us the use of an accounting and inventory system for a year)
Computer: $850 (for all the digital
needs of a modern day business)

If we
reach this goal we have an extended goal of $100,000 total so that we can add a
small tea and coffee area to the shop. This would not be such a big addition
but we’ll need to actually build a kitchen in our space and the majority of
that cost will go there.  If we reach the
point where this campaign succeeds to that extent, then we will post and
updated budget with those details on it.
The
Loot!!
A few of
our perks, these are my favorites!
For a $5
contribution: A mention of thanks on our contributors wall which will be
present both on our website and in our store. Video game tomb stones have
always been one of my favorite little details, you pick your name and pithy
epitaph and we put it on our walls!
For a $25
contribution: you receive an amazing t-shirt with our logo on it, and get a
mention of thanks on our wall and website!
For a $100
contribution: you receive a mention on our wall and website, a logo sticker, a
t-shirt, a choice of one ticket to one special event (book signing, artist meet
and greets, demonstrations, etc), and an invitation to our Grand Opening which
will be as close to a real comic con as I can make it!
For a
$1,000 contribution: A Comic Con gift basket that will include 2 tickets to our
local Comic Con, and tons of other nerdy goodies, your choice of 2 special
event tickets, an invitation to our Grand Opening, plus a mention on our walls
and 10% off on all in store purchases for a year.
For a
$10,000 contribution: A party for you and your favorite 7 nerdy friends after
hours in our store, an invitation to our Grand Opening, your choice of 4
special event tickets, a mention on our walls, and a 20% off on all in store
purchases for a year. (Limited Quantities!) 
If we don’t
reach the goal immediately whatever has been gathered will go towards putting
together a store, it will just take a little longer! All perks will be honored!
Who
this quest reaches:
As I said before, I wish I could say
that this project has an Earth shattering potential to improve the world but it
doesn’t. What it does have is world altering potential for my family. When
successful this business will give us independence. It will also give other
small businesses and artists a chance to live their dreams. 
By contributing to this project you
contribute to a dream, a dream of independence and sharing our passions with
others and bringing joy and wonder to our community.
Petty
villains:
Our business is a simple one as retail
businesses go, the most difficult problem we foresee is finding local artists
that are interested in selling their work. Our local Comic Con will be an
incomparable resource in finding locals that want to share their work with
others, we will also be sourcing artists on platforms like Etsy and Deviant Art
because they are amazing and experienced in sharing their art with the world.
Another difficulty we may face could
be getting customers in the door, we will be using social networks such as
Facebook and Twitter to really share ourselves and our business with the world,
we will be attending the nearest Comic Cons to promote our store amongst a crowd
that is our primary market, we will be blogging about the store, the merchandise,
the art and artists, new products, and anything else that relates to our
business, and we will also be holding events in our store (gaming tournaments, cosplay
competitions, art and book signings, meet and greets, and art demonstrations to
name a few).
We are nerds ourselves, my husband
grew up playing Magic the Gathering and reading comics, I grew up with my nose
buried in a book.  We met at a renaissance
faire. We may not be hardcore nerds but we definitely fall within nerdom.

I had never heard of this brand but, it was amazing ! This beautiful gift snowballed within our tribe and on a weekly basis we would be sharing with each other new recipes and products that suited our life styles. In an ideal world, we would have time to go out and source these things ourselves, but when you surround yourself with likeminded people who aim to bring out the best in you they open your eyes to these wonderful things themselves. </span></p><p></p>

</div></div>","Bliss Box was founded by yours truly; Lauren Gamble.  




I'm an environmentalist who sometimes forgets to compost, an academic who watches Keeping up with the Kardashians, a friend who is sometimes selfish and a yogini who loves wine.
Now you may see everything I just stated as contradictory... however I don't. I'm a human being -  I falter. In these moments of faltering there are three things you cannot take away from me; my tribe (community), my ability to love myself (self-love), and my home (Canada REPRESENT). It is on this foundation that I have based Bliss Box.
Bliss Box became clear to me whilst talking to some friends of mine in a Yoga class in Ottawa, Canada. On one particularly stressful day, working in a job I didn't like, on the mend from a particularly nasty break-up, and being newly back in Canada-  a member of my tribe (yoga buddies) offered me a brand of Canadian essential oils designed to calm and ease tension. I had never heard of this brand but, it was amazing ! This beautiful gift snowballed within our tribe and on a weekly basis we would be sharing with each other new recipes and products that suited our life styles. In an ideal world, we would have time to go out and source these things ourselves, but when you surround yourself with likeminded people who aim to bring out the best in you they open your eyes to these wonderful things themselves. 
This is what Bliss Box aims to do - we want to make self-love and self-care easier for you by providing a service that brings bliss directly to your doorstep. We are always going to be searching for the best products and they will always be Canadian. 




In a nutshell: 
Bliss Box is a monthly subscription service that ships Canadian health and wellness products with a conscience directly to your door. Whether it be a vegan granola bar, a mala bracelet or an organic eye cream, we understand that it can be hard to shop mindfully in a world that is interested in getting the best deal. We also understand that we are impossibly hard on ourselves and that you can only love others as much as you love yourself- this is why we want you to receive a gift each month from you, to you. 
       

On a step-by-step description this is how it works: 
1). You will sign up to your monthly subscription option (annual contract, annual no contract, and single delivery).
2). Once signed up, you will immediately become a part of our monthly newsletter which will have guest writers on health and wellness as well as insider information and promotions  on the previous months box contents. On the tenth of every month Bliss Box will ship out our monthly box filled with health and wellness goodies from Canadian companies directly to your door. 
3). You take some guilt free time to sit and enjoy the beautiful box of bliss we have bestowed upon you. 
It's that simple ! 
In the name of good Karma, Bliss Box is not a completely profit driven endeavor . A part of your monthly subscription will go to Canadian charities that stand by our foundation of community and self-love. Look at that - by ordering Bliss Box you are supporting Canadian business AND helping Canadian charities.


This is what I need from you:
We have chosen to launch our subscription via Indiegogo as a way to mitigate the initial costs of starting a business. This startup gives us the opportunity to create mutually beneficial relationships with vendors across the country built on support  of a community of small Canadian businesses. In turn, we are using this platform as a way of pre-selling Bliss Box to you and offering you significant initial incentives for helping us on our way. 
We really want to create a big'ol community that supports people who are doing what they love and offers people space to love themselves and therefore others... 
Please note that ALL contributions will be met and delivered upon ! 



Other ways you can help...
 We understand that sometimes it's just not in the realm of possibility to to contribute but if you like what we are doing and want to lend your support in other ways - please feel free to tell your friends about us and like us on all our social media outlets.

us from all over the world! People have recognized what we do, our passion

people who understand the wider perspective of coworking, its impact on local
community and the importance of connectivity of  independent entrepreneurs with peers worldwide. </p>
<p>We're putting a lot of effort to build a new self-sustaining local community
hub – the one which can act as a hub of activity for anyone with an independent
disposition, for those who seek a chance to build great things alongside the
Belgrade’s best and brightest. Smart Office will continue to be open to all: startups,
freelancers, students, artists, digital nomads and all the others who want to
work, collaborate, socialize, teach, and learn and an inspiring environment.
And to have fun while working, which is veeery important to us! Together we’re
building an affordable place for all of them so that they can work happier, be
more successful and thrive.</p>
<p><b>WHAT KIND OF COMMUNITY WE ARE?</b></p><p></p><p>Members of Smart Office are bright, hard-working, successful, inspiring
people to be around. They come from all types of educational and working
backgrounds, from all continents in the world. Most importantly, Smart Office
for them is not just a place of work but also a place where they can create and
share ideas, collaborate with other coworkers and expand their network and
opportunities. At the end of the day, everyone goes home smarter, happier, and
more inspired. Smart Office’s new space will be a home to countless events
focused on helping people learn to be better entrepreneurs and to connect with
others, such as meet-ups, workshops, brainstorming sessions, classes,
discussion groups, hackathons, fundraisers, business parties, and more.</p>
<p>When the space opens, which will be very soon, everyone is welcome to this energetic,
passionate, idea-jamming dream space: those who are tired of working from home
and talking to their pets, for parents refugees, for those who are having
meetings in bars and restaurants, or night birds who switched night and day
life routine and for many others. All of you should grab a laptop and drop in.

<h1>About Happy Mommy Herbs:
</h1>
<p>My name is Elecia, I am a Mother, Herbalist, and the creator of Happy Mommy Herbs. This is a 10 year culmination of my life’s work as an herbalist, and where my true passion is held.</p>
<p>My passion ignited when I became pregnant in late 2013, only to find that the knowledge available to Mothers about nourishing our bodies and our growing babies was scarce, and almost non-existent. The only herb I could find widely recommended for pregnancy was Red Raspberry Leaf! While this is an amazing herb in itself for strengthening the uterus, it is definitely not the only herb safe for pregnancy! There are a whole host of tonic herbs that are safe and very needed at this time to nourish our families, and especially our children, who will inherit this beautiful Earth after we depart.</p>
<p>I am the sole owner of this little shop and all the artwork associated with it has been created by me with joy and love. I truly put only the best of the best into these products and into the informational videos and articles on our <a href=""http://happymommyherbs.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>! We must demand the very best, for we are truly at a huge turning point in history, where we can reclaim back our own health and the health of our planet!</p>
<h1><b>What We Need:</b></h1>
<p>In order to start our small company, we need help purchasing the organic herbs and essential oils that we cannot harvest/make ourselves in our home climate.  </p>
<div>

<p>In addition to the herbs and essential oils, we would love to purchase our very own herbal distiller to make our own local essential oils from herbs we grow in our garden or harvest in the wild. </p>

<b>Why do we feel this is so important?</b>
</h1>
<p><i>In a recent study by the World Health Organization, the numbers for cancer are skyrocketing. 1 in 2 men will develop cancer within their lifetime and 1 in 3 women will develop cancer in their lifetime. The risk for childhood cancer is 1 in 15! They suggest a link between the introduction of GMO food and toxic environment to the rise in cancer rates. The link between nutrition-deficient, genetically modified food and the spraying of pesticides is now available for all to see. What will we ALL choose to do about this in our own lives?</i></p>
<p>There truly needs to be a game-changer in the way we nourish pregnancy, post-pregnancy, infants and children. We need safe options we can rely on to strengthen us, enliven us, and give us absolute radiant health in a time of soaring toxicity and destruction of our beloved planet. We believe that the Earth desperately needs people out there who are planting, harvesting, and caring deeply for this wonderful world, and our species desperately needs people out there who are knowledgeable about getting back to what is natural and helping us all to turn our health around so that we remain vibrant and youthful to the end of our days. What we do now is what we plant deep inside for our next generation, and for Mothers, this is very literal!</p>

My name is Elecia, I am a Mother, Herbalist, and the creator of Happy Mommy Herbs. This is a 10 year culmination of my life’s work as an herbalist, and where my true passion is held.
My passion ignited when I became pregnant in late 2013, only to find that the knowledge available to Mothers about nourishing our bodies and our growing babies was scarce, and almost non-existent. The only herb I could find widely recommended for pregnancy was Red Raspberry Leaf! While this is an amazing herb in itself for strengthening the uterus, it is definitely not the only herb safe for pregnancy! There are a whole host of tonic herbs that are safe and very needed at this time to nourish our families, and especially our children, who will inherit this beautiful Earth after we depart.
I am the sole owner of this little shop and all the artwork associated with it has been created by me with joy and love. I truly put only the best of the best into these products and into the informational videos and articles on our blog! We must demand the very best, for we are truly at a huge turning point in history, where we can reclaim back our own health and the health of our planet!
What We Need:
In order to start our small company, we need help purchasing the organic herbs and essential oils that we cannot harvest/make ourselves in our home climate.  

This is a very small selection of Happy Mommy Herbs sample products!
In addition to the herbs and essential oils, we would love to purchase our very own herbal distiller to make our own local essential oils from herbs we grow in our garden or harvest in the wild. 

The copper still that will enable us to make our own essential oils!

Here we are, harvesting fresh Jewelweed!


Why do we feel this is so important?

In a recent study by the World Health Organization, the numbers for cancer are skyrocketing. 1 in 2 men will develop cancer within their lifetime and 1 in 3 women will develop cancer in their lifetime. The risk for childhood cancer is 1 in 15! They suggest a link between the introduction of GMO food and toxic environment to the rise in cancer rates. The link between nutrition-deficient, genetically modified food and the spraying of pesticides is now available for all to see. What will we ALL choose to do about this in our own lives?
There truly needs to be a game-changer in the way we nourish pregnancy, post-pregnancy, infants and children. We need safe options we can rely on to strengthen us, enliven us, and give us absolute radiant health in a time of soaring toxicity and destruction of our beloved planet. We believe that the Earth desperately needs people out there who are planting, harvesting, and caring deeply for this wonderful world, and our species desperately needs people out there who are knowledgeable about getting back to what is natural and helping us all to turn our health around so that we remain vibrant and youthful to the end of our days. What we do now is what we plant deep inside for our next generation, and for Mothers, this is very literal!

Happy Mommy Herbs is not only a shop!
This is a vehicle for me to share my knowledge of plants, health, nutrition, recipes, and living in joy with our families. I have created a website FILLED with amazing links to books, documentaries, recipes, and have shared my own personal stories and insights, so that families can gain more wisdom for themselves about their health.

<p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read about our crowdfunding
campaign to open up a nightclub/restaurant in Santa Clarita, California. Los
Angeles has established an exciting and vibrant nightclub scene that fully
embraced and captured entertainment that young people can go to enjoy themselves
and have a good time. </p>
<p>Santa Clarita doesn't have any real
nightlife that compares to the exciting and entertaining LA scene. As a matter
of fact, there are nearly NO nightspots where they even have dancing at all!  We have one location that opens a back room to
their restaurant on Friday and Saturday nights. It’s small, dirty and the people
they allow in, frankly, make young adults, especially women, feel unsafe. </p>
<p>We are trying to
open a modern, high-tech Nightclub and Restaurant in Santa Clarita. With no
entertainment dance clubs for the over 40,000 young adults here, it is a nightlife desert where we have to travel elsewhere to find fun things to do. In most
cases, we have to drive up to 40 miles to some pretty seedy areas of Los
Angeles to go dancing and this is not only inconvenient for many of us, but it
would be safer to have a decent night club here in Santa Clarita. Most don't
bother or risk diving late at night out of the area. <b>More importantly, many of our sisters, brothers, family and friends are
either leaving to find work elsewhere or not returning when they graduate
college because there is nothing for them to do here in their off-hours! </b></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>           We're
looking for $150,000 to start our nightclub in Santa Clarita. We are looking
for funding for startup financing that will be needed to get our nightclub
started, coordinating with the Santa Clarita zoning board with finding a
location for our nightclub, funds for leasing or renting our nightclub
location, obtaining a food and liquor license, hiring managers and employees,
marketing and advertising and other expenses associated with opening up a
nightclub and restaurant. With the help of a business consultant with over 40 years’
experience in startups and business management, we have already completed our
entire our business plan, including a 3 year income projection, and the schedule to implement it. If we don't reach our goal we will implement the steps one at a time as we continue to fund raise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are the great perks we are offering:</p>
<p>$10 – 1 Free admittance</p>
<p>$50 – i5 T-Shirt plus 1 free admittance</p>
<p>$100 – Free admittance for you and 3 friends plus 4 i5 T-Shirts</p>
<p>$500 – 1 Year VIP Membership that includes no cover charge and no waiting in line for a full year! </p>
<p>$1000 – 1 Year VIP Membership for 2 people that includes no cover charge and no waiting in line for a full year plus 2 i5 T-Shirts and a $100 gift certificate for food and beverage! </p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>In Santa Clarita, we have two local colleges with over
24,000 students in our area with no place to have fun. If we are able to raise
enough funds to open up a new nightclub in our area, then young people in Santa
Clarita would not have to travel very far to find something to do. This would
also help promote safe and vibrant activity in support of Santa Clarita's
social experience in the community as well by keeping the entertainment dollars
local. This club will have all the high tech features of a fancy LA Downtown
clubs with high quality audio systems and lights including lasers. </p>
<p>Whether there’s an EDM DJ performing or we’re having a retro
night of disco, we will be prepared to dress the part and give people the same
sort of high-quality experience they would expect if they were driving into the
city.</p>
<p>  In addition
to benefiting the youth, our club (tentatively called i5) will benefit the
community of Santa Clarita by keeping revenue and tax dollars in the area.
There is no good reason for us to send off our own citizens every weekend,
their pockets filled, to Los Angeles. They could get the same experience here
at home, and our schools and public services could use the money they spend to
continue to make the town bigger and better. This is a win for everyone, but
mainly, <b><i><u>we don’t want to lose our family and friends!</u></i></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>     With your
support, your positive contributions that you can offer to our businesses will
help the nightlife in Santa Clarita area and provide a
fun and exciting place for students and young people alike to go to instead of
having to travel to Los Angeles. <b>Please
help us keep our friends at home!</b></p>
<b></b> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>      While starting a nightclub sounds like fun, it is also hard work.

No one should have to make do with bad bakes, and free from shouldn't be free from taste or quality ingredients! We've developed a range of amazing gluten free flour blends to transform your gluten free baking, and once you try them, you'll never want to go back to the supermarket stuff!


What's so special about our flour?
Our gluten free flour
blends are a perfect gluten free substitute for wheat flour, with no nasty
additives! Our flour really is different – it gives great results to gluten
free baking, without GMOs, chemical additives, or weird stabilisers, and it works exactly like wheat flour –
first time, every time.Our flour blends have been tried and tested on our baking courses, and give amazing results to your free from cooking. We know that baking gluten free can be tricky - recipes call for all sorts of different flours that can be difficult to source, and getting the proportions just right at home is time consuming. 
The prepackaged gluten free flour blends that are currently available can produce bakes with a bitter flavour and cloying aftertaste, and just don't work like traditional flour. Our blends work just like regular wheat flour in recipes, and as a bonus, they're more nutritious too! 
With our blends, you can make great gluten free baguettes, delicious bread, delectable pastry, irresistible scones and cakes, through to luxurious béchamel sauce, crepes suzette, choux and puff pastry and all things in between - with just the one bag of flour!
We want to make it easier for everyone to bake gluten free at home, and with our flour, you can bake ANYTHING and EVERYTHING and get incredible results. Once you've tried our flour, you won't go back, that's our promise.Why are we raising funds on Indiegogo?
We've created our very own plain flour blend, and we know it's the best gluten free flour out there. But we need your help to raise funds to produce two more - an incredible brown bread blend, and a premium Italian flour blend, a first for the gluten free market.We need your help to add to our range, so that everyone can make free from food that's not just 'good enough' at home - with our flours, it can be great!

Our Story
Our flour blends were born out of
desperation for something decent to eat when Ian was diagnosed with coeliac
disease in 2012. The sugary, additive laden offerings in the supermarket
free-from aisles left us feeling disappointed, and we knew we could do better
ourselves.
When we started baking our own
gluten free breads, cakes and puddings, we hit on something great – but the
flours that were available left us wanting more too. They were too bitter,
lacking in nutrition, and just didn’t produce the same results as their gluten
filled cousins. So we made our own!


Our Process
We started incorporating higher protein whole grain flours into our recipes, like teff, sorghum and Italian maize flour. The results were so good, we rapidly evolved our own blends and recipes, and used them in the delicious recipes and techniques we teach to people on our courses. From these blends we have created an incredible gluten free flour that has already garnered widespread acclaim.


What will my contribution pay for?
We need £15,000 to pay for: Production of our flour blend, the development of a brown bread blend and an Italian stone ground flour blend, the costs of designing and printing the packaging, the design of a new recipe booklet to accompany the flour blends, and creating marketing content to spread the word. We won’t be receiving any of these funds as personal income – every contribution received will be invested in our company and our products.

<b>Our campaign: We need $15,000 to transition from a small stall at the Pittsburgh Public Market to our very own retail store!</b><p>When I started baking sticky buns and pies in my grandmother's kitchen at the tender age of 5,  I never dreamed that one day it might turn into the thriving business it is today. Now Eliza's Oven makes tens of thousands of baked goods each year, has two part-time employees and two seasonal employees, and is out-growing our 200 sq/ft space at the market that acts as both production space AND retail space!</p>
<p>Currently Eliza's Oven retail capacity is very minimal. You have to call ahead to pre-order large orders and ALL cakes.  No j<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ust waltzing in off the street for that last minute birthday cake or to dash in to get that death by chocolate cake in hopes ""someone"" will get off scot-free for forgetting an anniversary.   Instead, we spread the wealth of our scrumptious pastries through wholesale accounts ranging from grocery stores to small tea shops and our catering efforts encompassing business breakfasts and lunches as well as weddings and celebrations.</span></p>
<p><b>On the heels of our second anniversary, we have an opportunity to open an actual storefront in Point Breeze.  Where you ask?  Well...</b></p>
<p>For a year and a half now, the once barber shop at 7105 Reynolds Avenue has sat empty and looks more and more sad and lonely as the days go by.  It is in need of some serious TLC and loving company and a purpose to stand proud again.  As a member of the community I have the desire to help in the beautification and restoration of this building both for the betterment of the neighborhood as well as for the betterment of my business by offering me a lower monthly rent for the business, residential foot traffic (it is right by a park!) and the ability to take more control over the day-to-day operations of my business that is not allowed to me at the moment--being based in a community/shared environment.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  Not to mention that a bakery &amp; cafe would not go amiss in this awesome community! </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Look at our plans for the building below!</span></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445522676/panm5l9gzklbtq2l6osy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If all goes according to plan we will open in February 2016! </span><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3><b>What will you sell?</b></h3>
<p>Everything!!</p>
<p>OK, Seriously. Eliza's Oven will continue to make the high quality pastries uniquely flavored with locally produced craft beverages.  And while you will still be able to make a custom order for your birthday, office event, or wedding, you’ll ALSO be able to stop in to get a delicious treat, pick up cupcakes on the way to a party, grab a pan of one of our fabulous savory pies for dinner or get a last-minute gift box for your sweetie.</p>
<p>In addition to our current menu we will be expanding our savory pies and our fresh breads selections to better serve the residents of Point Breeze as well as expanding our catering and wedding/celebration services</p>
<p>You can see our full menu <a href=""www.elizasoven.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">online</a>, but we are constantly rotating in new and seasonal flavors, so your best bet will be to stop in and browse!</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">How will we spend the money?</b><br/></p>
<p>We already have most of the things needed for the baking end of things, like lots of baking pans and whisks and measuring cups, but now we need to invest in the BIG things! And not only big things, but expensive things!</p>
<p>How much will all those big things cost?  After our research on market prices and quotes for similar projects our projection for final costs are $15,000.</p>
<p>This is how we’ll spend the money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial equipment: A commercial refrigerator and sinks!</li>
<li>A custom-built counter from our friends at Jonathan Moran Woodworks.</li>
<li>A sign for the outside of the building</li>
<li>Flooring</li>
<li>Paint and other spiff-up-ery for the interior</li>
<li>Cash register (we figure it is time to retire our little cash box!)</li>
<li>Construction to replace the facade of the building</li>
<li>And the biggest of them all, a power upgrade, which will require pulling more lines from the main grid into the building--oof!!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Expanded Goals</h3>
<p>Our initial $15K goal will allow us to get into the building and open - but there is so much more we need. If we raise additional funds, here’s what we’ll spend it on: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$16,500: </b>A dough sheeter, to aid us in pie production!</li>
<li>
<b>$17,500:</b> Website update, cash register accessories, sound system.</li>
<li>
<b>$18,000: Greater visibility: </b>Two sandwich board signs for the sidewalk, and a beautiful and eye catching display for the window - done with the aid of a professional!!</li>
<li>
<b>$19,000: Give back!</b> Increase the amount of cupcake donations we are able to give to support Pittsburgh Area nonprofits! We already give a significant number of donations and discounts – but we could definitely do more!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><h3 style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Who are we?</b></h3>

</div></div>","Our campaign: We need $15,000 to transition from a small stall at the Pittsburgh Public Market to our very own retail store!When I started baking sticky buns and pies in my grandmother's kitchen at the tender age of 5,  I never dreamed that one day it might turn into the thriving business it is today. Now Eliza's Oven makes tens of thousands of baked goods each year, has two part-time employees and two seasonal employees, and is out-growing our 200 sq/ft space at the market that acts as both production space AND retail space!
Currently Eliza's Oven retail capacity is very minimal. You have to call ahead to pre-order large orders and ALL cakes.  No just waltzing in off the street for that last minute birthday cake or to dash in to get that death by chocolate cake in hopes ""someone"" will get off scot-free for forgetting an anniversary.   Instead, we spread the wealth of our scrumptious pastries through wholesale accounts ranging from grocery stores to small tea shops and our catering efforts encompassing business breakfasts and lunches as well as weddings and celebrations.
On the heels of our second anniversary, we have an opportunity to open an actual storefront in Point Breeze.  Where you ask?  Well...
For a year and a half now, the once barber shop at 7105 Reynolds Avenue has sat empty and looks more and more sad and lonely as the days go by.  It is in need of some serious TLC and loving company and a purpose to stand proud again.  As a member of the community I have the desire to help in the beautification and restoration of this building both for the betterment of the neighborhood as well as for the betterment of my business by offering me a lower monthly rent for the business, residential foot traffic (it is right by a park!) and the ability to take more control over the day-to-day operations of my business that is not allowed to me at the moment--being based in a community/shared environment.    Not to mention that a bakery & cafe would not go amiss in this awesome community! 
Look at our plans for the building below!


If all goes according to plan we will open in February 2016! 
   
What will you sell?
Everything!!
OK, Seriously. Eliza's Oven will continue to make the high quality pastries uniquely flavored with locally produced craft beverages.  And while you will still be able to make a custom order for your birthday, office event, or wedding, you’ll ALSO be able to stop in to get a delicious treat, pick up cupcakes on the way to a party, grab a pan of one of our fabulous savory pies for dinner or get a last-minute gift box for your sweetie.
In addition to our current menu we will be expanding our savory pies and our fresh breads selections to better serve the residents of Point Breeze as well as expanding our catering and wedding/celebration services
You can see our full menu online, but we are constantly rotating in new and seasonal flavors, so your best bet will be to stop in and browse!
How will we spend the money?
We already have most of the things needed for the baking end of things, like lots of baking pans and whisks and measuring cups, but now we need to invest in the BIG things! And not only big things, but expensive things!
How much will all those big things cost?  After our research on market prices and quotes for similar projects our projection for final costs are $15,000.
This is how we’ll spend the money:

Commercial equipment: A commercial refrigerator and sinks!
A custom-built counter from our friends at Jonathan Moran Woodworks.
A sign for the outside of the building
Flooring
Paint and other spiff-up-ery for the interior
Cash register (we figure it is time to retire our little cash box!)
Construction to replace the facade of the building
And the biggest of them all, a power upgrade, which will require pulling more lines from the main grid into the building--oof!!

Expanded Goals
Our initial $15K goal will allow us to get into the building and open - but there is so much more we need. If we raise additional funds, here’s what we’ll spend it on: 


$16,500: A dough sheeter, to aid us in pie production!

$17,500: Website update, cash register accessories, sound system.

$18,000: Greater visibility: Two sandwich board signs for the sidewalk, and a beautiful and eye catching display for the window - done with the aid of a professional!!

$19,000: Give back! Increase the amount of cupcake donations we are able to give to support Pittsburgh Area nonprofits! We already give a significant number of donations and discounts – but we could definitely do more!     Who are we?



Eliza's Oven consists of me, Eliza Jane Bowman, Karen Baum, my part-time baker and full-time actress extraordinaire, and Lauren McNulty, My cafe manager, loving wife and mother of 3 - also a local Point Breeze Resident!
I am a self-taught baker, who took the skills I learned from my grandmother, the generous amounts of information online and in my many many cookbooks and combined it withe amazing local flavors of our partners Wigle Whiskey, East End Brewing Co., Commonplace Coffee, Healcrest Urban Farms, Clarion Farms Beef, Brunton Dairy (and many many more!) to create the most delectable flavors for our pies and pastries, such as our Steak in Stout Gravy Pot Pie and our Jump Jitter and Java Cake.  And of course, we specialize in stickybuns, just like my Grandma did!

The RisksOkay, I’ll tell you what you already know: running a food business is hard work! We can’t predict the future, but here’s what we do know:
Customers love our products! A lot of our success is due to our awesome customers reviewing us on YELP and telling their friends to come and find us! Whenever I think, “Hold on, what am I doing??” All of the positive feedback from customers is what keeps me in the business.

Bretty Fingers was a name given to me by a friend who joked that everything I touch gets inoculated with the wild yeast species Brettanomyces and gets funky and wild. I proudly wear shirts with Brettanomyces splayed across them, to the horror and chagrin of various brewers and winemakers I've met. While the name is, thankfully (a brewer who cannot brew a beer without infecting it certainly isn't desirable), a joke, I was proud of the title as a passionate lover of all funky and wild beers – so proud, that I gleefully take it as my brewing name in this project.
WHO AM I?



My name is Aiden Robert Jönsson. I am born and raised almost entirely in Los Angeles, but with Swedish family. I now live in Stockholm, where I have been studying and creating a life for myself. My studies have been in marine and mechanical engineering, as well as in meteorology and climatology.
My big thing is fermentation. I've been fermenting things for six years now, brewing beer and mead, baking with sourdough, making kimchee, sauerkraut, and all manner of fermented vegetables. Most who know me introduce me with, ""he ferments … everything."" I have worked in a brewpub in Anaheim, California, as well as interned in breweries in and around Stockholm.
Now, I take on increasingly complex projects in the realm of fermented foodstuffs, and have moved on to brewing mostly with alternative & wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria – farmhouse and wild, mixed-culture ales.
I wish, more than anything, to make fermentation my way of life and to become an advocate for fermentation and rich microbial biodiversity. This project is exactly the venue through which I want to explore this life path.   THE PLAN
In order to get Bretty Fingers' beers out to the world, we're going to need a few things to get started. Here's a breakdown for you, so you know exactly where the funds will be going:




BREWHOUSE USE. Luckily, we have been invited and blessed with the collaboration of the brewery Brewing Költur, and while I won't have to start from scratch with building a brewhouse and getting the proper licenses – which is good news for us all, because beer can be made and sold as soon as the project is funded – I will need to pay for brewery usage fees.

<p>
    There are many popular protein pancakes and/or mixed grain ""healthier"" pancake mixes on the market, but what syrup do you put on them? That's the dilemma. There is nothing you can put on pancakes that isn't comprised of sugar, sugar alcohols, artificial sweeteners, or straight fructose. Your favorite organic real maple syrup has something like 53 diabetes inducing grams of sugar per serving. <em>It's just not healthy</em>. It may be 100% natural and organic but it is also 100% not good for you. What about the sugar alcohol and artificial sweetened syrups? They don't taste good. Everyone wants the real flavors of real syrups but without all the real drawbacks associated with them. That's why we need your help to launch the first line of syrups that solves all of these problems.</p>

<strong>The Silver Fern™ Brand Story</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Silver Fern was born in 2014 out of a simple vision: to create the ultimate natural sweetener. Kakato™ sweetener was the result of that effort. Kakato™ sweetener is made from natural ingredients, has no sugar, no sugar alcohols, includes dietary fiber and looks and tastes just like real sugar.
</p>
<p>
    The bottom line is Kakato™ sweetener provides all the good:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
        Natural
    </li>
<li>
        Looks like sugar
    </li>
<li>
        Tastes like sugar
    </li>
<li>
        Dietary fiber
    </li>
<li>
        Low calories
    </li>
<li>
        Low glycemic index
    </li>
<li>
        Satisfying and filling
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    And none of the bad:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
        No unpleasant aftertaste
    </li>
<li>
        No unpleasant digestive side effects</li>
<li>
        No artificial or chemical ingredients
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Kakato™ sweetener changed everything. We immediately started to develop it into new products; baking mixes, drink mixes, meal replacement shakes
    and more.
</p>
<h2 style=""color:#F16560;"">
<strong>The Syrup Solution</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    We then researched and tested for over a year to find a way to turn Kakato™ sweetener into a syrup. Introducing Silver Fern™ Brand syrups, made from natural Kakato™ sweetener:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
        Taste just like real syrups
    </li>
<li>
        No unpleasant aftertaste
    </li>
<li>
        No artificial colors, sweeteners or flavors
    </li>
<li>
        No sugar alcohols
    </li>
<li>
        Fewer calories than sugar syrups
    </li>
<li>
        High in dietary fiber
    </li>
<li>
        0 g to 1 g of sugar per serving
    </li>
<li>
        Low net carbs
    </li>
<li>
        Low glycemic index

<li>

I will introduce you to my campaign designed to raise funds to complete my food truck C'est Bon Manger. My project began 3 years ago when I became discouraged with only having just enough to survive. I thought surviving was not for me. I wanted to thrive. I wanted to give. I wanted to make a difference in other's lives. </p>
<p>I prayed about this and came up with an idea to start a food truck. After putting the numbers together I thought, there is no way I can do this business in less than 5 years. I was wrong.

</div></div>","My Story Hello, my name is Jamar. I will introduce you to my campaign designed to raise funds to complete my food truck C'est Bon Manger. My project began 3 years ago when I became discouraged with only having just enough to survive. I thought surviving was not for me. I wanted to thrive. I wanted to give. I wanted to make a difference in other's lives. 
I prayed about this and came up with an idea to start a food truck. After putting the numbers together I thought, there is no way I can do this business in less than 5 years. I was wrong. During this time I began to develop a prayer life, I began to make going to church a priority, and I developed a trust in God like never before. To my surprise, money just started to come in from unlikely places I was able to figure out how to use money I had in other places to fund my project. Long story short, in a matter of two and a half years I was almost done with my food truck project. I truly believe the difference was the way I now lived. I took a chance, believed in God, and consulted Him for even the smallest of things. Everything started to change. I am now at the very end of this project and understand that another test has begun.

</p><p><b>Dear Friends/Colleagues,</b></p>
<p>As some of you may or may not know, I
am involved with a 501(c)3 non-profit organization called Community2Community Haiti
(C2C Haiti). My family hails from the island nation which occupies the western
third of the island of Hispaniola. I have been blessed enough to visit several
times, and can tell you that the country is so much more than the oft-moniker
“poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.” 
It is a beautiful country full of amazing scenery, wonderful food, rich
history and culture, and a warmhearted, hard-working, resilient people who want
nothing more than to move forward.</p>
<p>When I looked for an organization to
volunteer my time/financial support with, I wanted to choose one that is honest
and making a tangible impact. An organization that is about more than just heartbreaking
photos of malnourished children, as these campaigns (while well-meaning) tend
to provide short-term solutions to the much greater economic, political,
educational, and infrastructure challenges. Many of these solutions also hinder
economic development by fostering dependence, and contribute to the cycle of
poverty – putting local farmers, merchants, clothing manufacturers,
construction workers, etc. out of business.</p>
<p><b>Since the earthquake...</b><br/>While thousands of NGOs flocked to
Haiti before, during, and after the horrific earthquake in 2010, progress has been
slow and has many asking where the money has gone. Sustainable and long-term
progress in moving things forward doesn’t come from charity and handouts – it comes from
empowering people to become self-sufficient, independent, and to participate in
rebuilding their own communities - creating jobs, improving public infrastructure, and providing access to education and healthcare.  <br/><br/><b>Why Community2Community Haiti (c2c Haiti)</b><br/>That’s just what Community2Community Haiti is
all about - developing communities by working WITH the community. C2C works side-by-side local community groups in Petit Goave, Haiti – passionate engineers,
architects, teachers, and medical professionals, building solutions from the
ground up – built for the people, by the people. </p>
<p>I am writing to ask for your support in helping me raise funds as
a Community2Community Haiti Ambassador. You’ll be supporting:<br/>
<br/><b>Our Water Initiative:</b> building <span>a water distribution system that will give our
community partner on the mountainside access to clean, potable water and developing
commerce with sales of surplus water to neighboring communities<br/><b>Our Reforestation Initiative:</b><i> <em>planting one
million trees in Haiti, raising awareness about the root causes and severe
impacts of deforestation</em></i> <br/><b>Our Education Initiative:</b> we
sponsor a school program that educates 315 children in our mountainside
community, building a temporary school shelter and paying teacher stipends. Community2Community's
central education initiative is the construction of the Saul Louis Community
School - a state of the art facility that will allow the children in the
community to prepare for higher educational platforms and provide adults with
training programs regarding health, business and economic development.<br/>
<b>Our Road Initiative:</b> building a road
that will connect our mountainside community with surrounding towns –
facilitating commerce and travel to and from work and school.  <br/><br/>
So says the proverb, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man
how to fish and he will eat for a life time.” Please join me by considering
making a one-time donation or becoming a C2C neighbor. You can become a C2C
neighbor for as little as $15 a month, and one-time donations of any size would
be greatly appreciated by the people of Petit Goave! Donations are tax deductible and go straight towards the project we are running in Haiti.  </span></p>

I am a rabid gardener and Bonsai enthusiast and would spend hours in the yard, one day I decided I wanted to give back to my community but creating and selling beautiful Bonsai. Unfortunately, turning The Wandering Bonsai into a business was put on hold due to a career change, then a move to Las Vegas, then life, then more life. Almost ten years later, I am finally ready to fulfill my dream, and I will launch this dream in a unique and innovative way. </p><p>Join me in making this concept a reality by funding my startup costs! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482873011/s0up6tyvgu1iajahc0iq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>My goal is to create a mobile Bonsai shop by outfitting a 12 - 14 foot enclosed trailer into a retail 'store' from which I will sell Bonsai and supplies as well as teach classes and workshops. By keeping the Bonsai shop mobile provides an opportunity for more exposure in the community and drastically reduces expenses in the form of utilities, rent, etc. allowing for a stronger focus on delivering quality products.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482878142/celj0rgdujriffcciukq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>The Market  </h2><p>Austin is the perfect city to launch this endeavor, it has become the epicenter of mobile retail, specifically food trucks, but we are starting to see a trend towards non-food retail and people are paying attention. There are also an endless number of festivals, street fairs, and farmer's markets around Austin that would love to have a Bonsai retailer join their vendor list. Everyone loves a beautiful Bonsai and there is always a demand for Bonsai as gifts but after joining the Austin Bonsai Society and working with the limited number of retail options here in Austin, it is also clear that there is a need for a legitimate retail supplier of tools, pots, and soils in the greater Austin area. Right now most intermediate to expert Bonsai enthusiasts buy their necessary tools and supplies from online vendors. The Wandering Bonsai hopes to alleviate their need to buy online by providing those items in our shop.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482877559/vrjwuishhajjnyxp2l4l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Financial Path to Success  </h2><p>With The Wandering Bonsai's unique vision and the gap in retailers in Austin, the company expects its profits to steadily increase over the first year. Even with our conservative projections, net profits are projected to increase by almost 80% over the next three years, from ~$15,000 to ~$27,000 and will maintain a 35-40% net profit each year. To get this startup business off the ground and maintain sufficient cash over the first year, the company will be asking to borrow $30,000. Our projected cash flow will increase our cash balance and allow us to leverage this asset to creating new opportunities. During this time, we do not expect any difficulties in maintaining sufficient sales to meet our costs.</p><p>Our startup table does not reflect the 30,000 as I've decided to include the Indiegogo expenses and a small truck downpayment totalling $4,500. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482877612/zbquhxirvbglzo2967pv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Keys To Success</h2><p><strong>1. Location</strong> - a mobile retail trailer will provide us the opportunity to cater to the entire Austin community.  </p><p><strong>2. Knowledge and dedication</strong>- Daniel Pintauro - Tabares' knowledge, expertise and dedication to the art of Bonsai will propel the business forward and create a regular clientele.  </p><p><strong>3. Need</strong> - there are very few Bonsai retailers in the Austin area so The Wandering Bonsai will fill a void by offering Bonsai and products for both the novice and expert.  </p><p><strong>4.

I am a rabid gardener and Bonsai enthusiast and would spend hours in the yard, one day I decided I wanted to give back to my community but creating and selling beautiful Bonsai. Unfortunately, turning The Wandering Bonsai into a business was put on hold due to a career change, then a move to Las Vegas, then life, then more life. Almost ten years later, I am finally ready to fulfill my dream, and I will launch this dream in a unique and innovative way. Join me in making this concept a reality by funding my startup costs! My goal is to create a mobile Bonsai shop by outfitting a 12 - 14 foot enclosed trailer into a retail 'store' from which I will sell Bonsai and supplies as well as teach classes and workshops. By keeping the Bonsai shop mobile provides an opportunity for more exposure in the community and drastically reduces expenses in the form of utilities, rent, etc. allowing for a stronger focus on delivering quality products.The Market  Austin is the perfect city to launch this endeavor, it has become the epicenter of mobile retail, specifically food trucks, but we are starting to see a trend towards non-food retail and people are paying attention. There are also an endless number of festivals, street fairs, and farmer's markets around Austin that would love to have a Bonsai retailer join their vendor list. Everyone loves a beautiful Bonsai and there is always a demand for Bonsai as gifts but after joining the Austin Bonsai Society and working with the limited number of retail options here in Austin, it is also clear that there is a need for a legitimate retail supplier of tools, pots, and soils in the greater Austin area. Right now most intermediate to expert Bonsai enthusiasts buy their necessary tools and supplies from online vendors. The Wandering Bonsai hopes to alleviate their need to buy online by providing those items in our shop.  Financial Path to Success  With The Wandering Bonsai's unique vision and the gap in retailers in Austin, the company expects its profits to steadily increase over the first year. Even with our conservative projections, net profits are projected to increase by almost 80% over the next three years, from ~$15,000 to ~$27,000 and will maintain a 35-40% net profit each year. To get this startup business off the ground and maintain sufficient cash over the first year, the company will be asking to borrow $30,000. Our projected cash flow will increase our cash balance and allow us to leverage this asset to creating new opportunities. During this time, we do not expect any difficulties in maintaining sufficient sales to meet our costs.Our startup table does not reflect the 30,000 as I've decided to include the Indiegogo expenses and a small truck downpayment totalling $4,500. Keys To Success1. Location - a mobile retail trailer will provide us the opportunity to cater to the entire Austin community.  2. Knowledge and dedication- Daniel Pintauro - Tabares' knowledge, expertise and dedication to the art of Bonsai will propel the business forward and create a regular clientele.  3. Need - there are very few Bonsai retailers in the Austin area so The Wandering Bonsai will fill a void by offering Bonsai and products for both the novice and expert.  4. Unique - the unique idea of selling Bonsai and its various parts and offering maintenance plans and classes out of a mobile retail trailer will create excitement and buzz.  5. Health care - What makes Daniel's vision unique is his dedication to the life of your tree; a Bonsai is an investment and so Daniel includes a free pamphlet on the care of each type of Bonsai, as well as offers maintenance plans, babysitting, yearly replanting plans, and triage sessions.  6. Social media - combining the mobile unit with a social media presence will further the reach of the business, specifically providing customers with information on where the mobile unit will be stationed any given day. The ProductThe Wandering Bonsai will sell everything and anything related to the art of Bonsai.  •Each new Bonsai will be prepared, by Daniel, using traditional techniques of reweaving roots, potting, styling, trimming, pruning, and wiring. • You will also be able to purchase an assortment of pots, soil, fertilizers, tools, and ornaments.

of the world, a one hundred year old lighthouse tower</b> is standing on a desolate island deteriorating, while the northern lights
are dancing above, the Norwegian Sea is rolling in the west and the Lofoten
mountains are standing steady in the south. Littleisland Lighthouse  can be fixed and live for another hundred years, for the price of 220.000

an awful lot of money, but for Elena Hansteensen who lives at the lighthouse, it
is a lot. <br/>
</p>
<p>""I bought this lighthouse for a relatively small amount of money,
very soon ten years ago. Promising to make it available to other people, I left journalism and humanitarian work around the world in order to focus on this lighthouse project in the middle of the sea. But I
didn’t have a lot of savings and had to be creative about how to move on.""  </p>

<p><b>Help from

around 200 volunteers coming from all over the world, we have now managed
to establish a small guest section with two double rooms in the old house of
the lighthouse keepers’, an ecologically grown green garden and a herbal land. A very sturdy boat, a
floating quay and a boat lift helps making the lighthouse available for people
to visit all seasons. A huge solar panel
is giving us electricity during summertime, and while awaiting a windmill we are using
a diesel generator a couple of hours a day on the darkest days of the year.</p>

We want to give you the opportunity to be almost entirely alone in the middle of wild nature, sheltered within the comfort of your very own lighthouse. But help is needed to make it happen.



Littleisland Lighthouse tower can be fixed and live for another hundred years. Photographer: Lucas Amaral. 
At the edge
of the world, a one hundred year old lighthouse tower is standing on a desolate island deteriorating, while the northern lights
are dancing above, the Norwegian Sea is rolling in the west and the Lofoten
mountains are standing steady in the south. Littleisland Lighthouse  can be fixed and live for another hundred years, for the price of 220.000
Euros. 



Available for you. For some people 220.000 Euros might not be
an awful lot of money, but for Elena Hansteensen who lives at the lighthouse, it
is a lot. 

""I bought this lighthouse for a relatively small amount of money,
very soon ten years ago. Promising to make it available to other people, I left journalism and humanitarian work around the world in order to focus on this lighthouse project in the middle of the sea. But I
didn’t have a lot of savings and had to be creative about how to move on.""

Help from
volunteers. Thanks to
around 200 volunteers coming from all over the world, we have now managed
to establish a small guest section with two double rooms in the old house of
the lighthouse keepers’, an ecologically grown green garden and a herbal land. A very sturdy boat, a
floating quay and a boat lift helps making the lighthouse available for people
to visit all seasons. A huge solar panel
is giving us electricity during summertime, and while awaiting a windmill we are using
a diesel generator a couple of hours a day on the darkest days of the year.

Guest Section. There are a few practical challenges to cope with when living alone on an uninhibited island at the edge of the Norwegian Sea. It’s all worth the struggle when guests can come and share this adventure.  We receive guests all year round in our guest section, currently two rooms.

Lighthouse
renovation. The time has now come to renovate the lighthouse tower itself. We want to make it available to you and others who would like to come and live in this
hundred year old house. The plan is to turn it into a suite of three small
rooms where one person, a couple or a small family could stay for some days. Here you will enjoy the island and the truly unique 360 degrees view to the ocean and the
Lofoten mountains. So if you are dreaming of staying a few days at a lighthouse
in the middle of the ocean, the idea can come true if you contribute to the
renovation of Littleisland Lighthouse Tower.

building that should be restored and protected through use. Therefore they
give 54.000 Euros to this project. Another Norwegian foundation

Where will the money go? The lighthouse tower has suffered from serious water leakages over several years.  Cracks in the balcony will be covered. The metal part of the tower is rusty and needs sanding.
Then the metal will be galvanised before it is painted. All the windows in the glass top must be changed. For most of
this we need professional help. Then we can work on the indoor; new floor,
walls and insulation, bathroom to be made and a heating system installed. Some of this can be
done on a volunteer basis but most has to be done by professionals.

<br/>
<p>The “Buy a meal, Save a life” campaign
stems from a core principle embedded in the Grassy Roots Pharmacy &amp;
Nutrition business model and that is to help people. The global goal of this
project is to create a company designed to help patients' take control of their
health while at the same time create a sustainable philanthropy service in local communities. The philanthropy portion of
the company is built in the core business model, and our target niche for the company will be for the under-served population who are either homeless or in extreme poverty that are released from the hospital and lost to followup. These patients often end up back in the hospital because they have nowhere to get the care they need to stay healthy. The philanthropy portion of the
company will be directly funded from the proceeds from patient’s
subscriptions to the program, which will be sold by weekly
and monthly basis, and will be tiered and priced based on the amount of meals
and days that meals are provided. An example of how this will work: for every
10 subscriptions of a 5 day meal plan purchased, they will sponsor a meal plan and medications
for a person in need. Participants in the program will receive updates on those people that they are contributing to help.

<br/>
<p>In a nutshell, Grassy Roots is providing pharmacy services with an additional meal service
that trains patients to cook for themselves with ingredients and recipes specific to their health
needs. The nutrition service is a subscription based program that provides guidance, hands on experience, and tailored plans for patients that have multiple
disease states that require diet restrictions such as diabetes and heart failure. The pharmacy services include medication therapy management, patient education, personalized medication logs, adherence tools, patient financial assistance, and many other services.

One of the first goals Grassy Roots is
setting to achieve is to prove the company can improve patients' health outcomes. Improving health outcomes can be measured in many forms including maintaining better disease control, less hospitalizations, and increasing a patient's quality of life. Part of the contributions made to this campaign will fund a study that will follow a small cohort of patients enrolled into our program over several months. If the results of the study prove that our program improves patient outcomes, it can open opportunities for negotiations  and contracts with insurance companies to help pay
for the program in the forms of co-pays or co-insurance. <br/><p><br/></p>

<br/><p>The Grassy Roots donation structure aims to reward our contributors in a way that is reflected in our core principle of helping others. For every donation over $50, you will not only be helping build a company that aims to help patients take control over their health, but you will also sponsor a person in need in the form of care packages. Care packages are formulated by going out into the streets and asking people what they need most. Some examples include undergarments, socks, hygiene products, food, bus passes, and materials to help get a job interview. We have started going out to help the homeless in Nashville and have posted some of the interviews on the Grassy Roots Facebook page. The Grassy Roots Facebook page will serve as a forum to share how your donations are directly affecting peoples lives. We hope to add hundreds of these videos as we get contributions to the campaign. <br/></p>

My experience with patients is that if you give the time to figure who they
are, what makes them happy, how they go through their day to day, you can help
them create a tailored plan for their health that suits their needs. This is
not only beneficial to the patients, but society as a whole as we avoid
