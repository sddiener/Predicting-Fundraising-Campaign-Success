<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>The East Coast - based Cassera family art business was founded by the late George D. Cassera in 1960. Over the past 50 years, the gallery has maintained a strong emphasis on fine art and design. In 2011, David A. Cassera opened two Pacific Northwest gallery locations (Vancouver B.C. and LaConner, WA) while maintaining a seasonal New York City presence. David, the youngest son of four boys, is an international specialist in the traditional arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. David has continued with his father’s fine art and design legacy with an additional focus on ‘Primitivism’. ‘Primitivism’ is a Western art movement that borrows visual forms from non-Western or indigenous peoples, such as Picasso’s embrace of African and Oceanic sculpture during the dawn of Cubism. Cassera utilizes his inherent design talent in juxtaposition with his vast knowledge of ancient cultures to emphasize how borrowings from ‘Primitive Art’ has been important to the development of modern and contemporary art. David provides sales, expertise and professional fine art appraisals for single items or entire collections.</p>
<h3>AGENDA</h3>
<p>David Cassera has an extensive history in fine art and marketing. His gallery business model consists of Fine Art, Music and Wine. David would like to bring this experience to Camano Island in the Spring of 2017. Utilizing the space discussed David plans to build display walls, build a wine bar, install lighting, etc. The space would be multi-use for wine tasting, art receptions and live musical performances, something Camano Island is currently missing.</p>
<h3>THE ART</h3>
<p>Utilizing the vast network of artists David knows personally on Camano Island, Seattle, and the Skagit Valley he plans to create a rotating schedule of events known simply as ‘art receptions’. This would include between 3-5 themed ‘Group Shows’ a year, ie; Bird Show, Landscape Show, Figural Show, etc. In addition there would be 4-6 artist ‘one man’ shows determined by quality and artistic merit. The works would be for sale based on the demographic of consumers on the island. Openings would be scheduled and marketed based on the best days, times and seasons to encourage local Camano Islanders to stay involved in the Camano ‘Art Scene’ that we will revive once again.</p>

<p>My name is William Franken (<a href=""http://www.willfranken.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.willfranken.com</a>), an award-winning, critically-acclaimed comedian and satirist whose work has been praised on both sides of the Atlantic, from the<i> Guardian</i> to the late Robin Williams. Twenty years ago, before embarking on a performing career, I was a university level literature instructor with an obsession for the pre-Romantic movement, of which William Blake is arguably the central artistic and literary figure. This project, for me, is a whirlwind return to a lifelong passion. </p>
<p>Please help support the creation of the William Blake documentary, <i>Red, White, and Blake. </i>Unlike other films on Blake, this work will largely eschew the well-known biographical details of the poet’s life, instead drilling down on a four-fold exploration of his visionary works. Using his poetry and art themselves as guiding spirits, we will highlight Blake's radical theological vision, contempt for all forms of physical and mental slavery, support for the political revolutions of his day, and, most importantly, his contrarian vision of authentic artistic progress. </p>
<p>Structurally, the work will be an homage to Blake’s unique mythology of the <i>Four Zoas</i>, with each fifteen-minute section in the hour-long programme focusing on one aspect of Blake’s own four-fold vision.</p>
<p>The intent is to present this documentary as a pilot to BBC Four as part one in a series tentatively entitled <i>Rebels in the Arts</i>, (with prospectuses on Jonathan Swift, James Joyce, and others to follow).</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with the works of William Blake, this documentary will serve as an excellent starting point from which to understand this singular visionary genius. On the other hand, if, like me, you are a fellow Blake enthusiast, this film will add unique and compelling layers of historical and philosophical context to your appreciation of his works. </p>
<p>The budget of £2,500 is to support the production as we work towards the goal of an August 2017 release.  We will focus our energies on ensuring we produce an accurately-researched, informative, and thought-provoking documentary, whilst continuing to scout locations, rifle through the Blake archives at the Tate Museum and British Library, procure interviews with Blake scholars and theological experts, and secure music copyrights where need be. </p>
<p>For those already familiar with Blake's <i>Four Zoas</i> -- or for those keen to learn -- below is a chapter-by-chapter structural breakdown of the project. (And thank you in advance for your support!)</p>
<p><strong>ZOA I: THARMAS [THEOLOGY]</strong> will cover Blake’s unique understanding of the Divine Duality of Man. It begins with an historical contextualisation of Blake’s early radical background as the son of English Dissenters. From his rebellion against the established Anglican Church of his day, the historical lens is widened to accommodate the shifts in ethical understanding brought about earlier by the Enlightenment, particularly in the works of Immanuel Kant, and from there to the radical cosmology of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, an early theological influence on the young William Blake. The section will conclude with Blake’s ultimate rejection of Swedenborgian cosmology in favour of his own unique system of a necessary duality, evident in such rebellious works as <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>.  </p>
<p><strong>ZOA II: URIZEN [SLAVERY] </strong>will deal with Blake’s broad contempt for slavery. Using as a departure point his revolutionary credo “I must create a system or be enslaved by another man’s”, this Zoa will begin with Blake’s rejection of the fashionable 18th Century schools of art, highlighting in particular Blake’s venom for the portrait painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. Blake’s own unique hybrid of visual art intertwined with the written word, as well as his elaborate mythology concerning the fall and division of the God-Man Albion into Four Zoas, will set the thematic stage for Blake’s rejection of any and all enslaving systems. From his engravings for John Stedman’s book on the slave plantations of Surinam to poems like “Little Black Boy”, his repulsion against physical slavery will come into focus. From there, the too-often overlooked negative consequences of the Industrial Revolution are explored in, among many other works, both versions of “The Chimney Sweeper”. Finally, Blake’s broader disgust at mental, spiritual, and creative slavery are realised in the “mind-forg’d manacles” of “London” in addition to his starkly critical portrait of Isaac Newton, from which parallels will be drawn to the technological, ideological, and economical enslavements of our own postmodern times. </p>
<p><strong>ZOA III: LUVAH [LIBERTY]</strong> will draw attention to Blake’s unique historical position as a pre-Romantic political visionary, heralding the dawn of a new era wherein the rights of individual man are championed in the American and French Revolutions. As the 18<sup>th</sup> Century comes to a close, Blake’s optimism for the anti-monarchical movements sweeping both the continent and the colonies is seen through his literary prism as Man’s spiritual trudge towards Divine destiny. Drawing heavily upon Blake’s larger prophetic works, notably <i>America</i> and <i>Europe</i>, we see how the dispassionate emphasis on reason which characterised the early 18<sup>th</sup> Century failed to anticipate, in its heavily-ordered view of the universe, the demands for liberty and justice that would emerge at the century’s close.</p>
<p><strong>ZOA IV: URTHONA [CONTRARY]</strong> will be an extensive recapitulation of the first three Zoas, drawing upon Blake’s later works, namely <i>Milton </i>and <i>Jerusalem</i>, en route to a critical modern-day application of his profound axiom: “Without Contraries is No Progression”. This Zoa begins with William Blake’s sedition trial in Sussex at the start of 1804, an historical springboard by which to analyse his belief in the necessity of division for arriving at artistic, cultural, and political truths. Aside from Blake’s own understanding of Biblical scripture, parallels to the work of the German contemporary Friedrich Hegel as well as various schools of Eastern thought, specifically Taoism, will serve as philosophical underpinnings to justify, in all fields of human endeavour, the rejection of a monolithic status quo. The impassioned cries from more obscure uprisings like the Luddite Rebellion of 1811 to the larger Romantic movement as a whole, will echo down to our present age by means of Blake's far-seeing prophetic artistic filter. </p>

<p>The Eiffel Tower story is one the most amazing of existing monuments.

</h2> <p>This project is a return to my childhood home, an abandoned schoolhouse, to create art from the things my mother hoarded over the years and explore questions she can no longer answer in her current mental state. This is a journey of self-discovery. This is my story:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437761247/rjn5auy8ezgmhk7wda1j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When I was 11, my parents moved our family to an abandoned school building in rural Colorado. I lived there for 6 years, without plumbing, central heat, or full electricity. Isolated and disconnected from a community, my mother's hoarding took over a lot of the space. It was a strange and challenging place to grow up. My parents have since moved to the closest town, 40 minutes away, leaving the school house abandoned once again. Two years ago, my mother was in a serious bike accident, suffering severe brain damage. I started taking trips back home to help my father care for my mother. In revisiting my past, I realized there was much that was unresolved within me that I had been avoiding. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Last summer I decided to go back to this building after a decade away, to live and work there alone, creating art pieces from materials I found in the building. Living in isolation (no internet or cell phone) and surrounded by my memories and family history, I used the experience of transforming physical materials as a way to transform my relationship to my story. With my mother's damaged mind, I am not able to communicate and connect with her as I did before. This project is also a way for me to learn about and connect to her through the lifetime of things she has held onto, and a way to use my challenges as fuel to focus on and create beauty and love. <br/></p>
<p>I am eager to get back to Colorado and continue this series of work with the intention of putting together a solo show in NYC, owning and sharing my story with others. This is my most vulnerable and authentic work to date. <br/></p>
<h2>How funds will be used:</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>To continue making
this body of work, I need help with funding this project and supporting my
family. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Expenses:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Packaging/shipping of finished pieces to NYC in November: $3000</li>
<li>Gallery Space rental: $500/dayx5 days: $2500<br/>

<li>Basic art supplies (tarps/adhesive/tools/resin/wood):
     $500</li>
<li>Temporary storage for pieces before show in NYC: $200<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If
I surpass my campaign goal, additional funds will go towards <b>stretch goals</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care for my mother for 4 days (so my father can see the
     show in NYC): $1200<br/>
</li>
<li>Extended dates for exhibition: $500/day</li>

</ul>

<h2>What this project explores:</h2>

</h2>
</div><div>
<p>This project is for everyone who has felt shameful or alone. For many years I was ashamed of where I am from, and I felt very much alone in what I was going through. It takes courage to dig into unpleasant memories and expose our wounds to the light, but it's the only way to come to a complete healing. I'm using this project as a way to connect with others, to share in our unique human experiences. I hope to inspire you to share your stories and shed light on what has been kept in the dark.  With this project, my relationship to my artistic process and my self continues to transform in ways I never imagined.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This work is about the human experience: life/death, light/dark, 
creation/destruction, and order/chaos being part of the same process. 
I'm exploring what comes up in space, silence, and isolation, what we 
fill our spaces with, what happens when these things and spaces 
deteriorate, making use of the unused, and the energy that objects take 
on as we keep them in our lives.  It is my hope that people take 
away from this project the importance of shedding light on difficult 
experiences, accepting all parts of our selves, and
 sharing our 
stories. What makes us unique makes us beautiful. <br/></p>
</div><div> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help:</h2> <p>If you want to be a part of this journey with me, but cannot contribute financially, please share this campaign on social media and in your networks. I'm also open to other ideas about ways to support this project, showing it in NYC, or direct ways to help my family. <br/></p>

</div></div>","My Story: 
 This project is a return to my childhood home, an abandoned schoolhouse, to create art from the things my mother hoarded over the years and explore questions she can no longer answer in her current mental state. This is a journey of self-discovery. This is my story:


When I was 11, my parents moved our family to an abandoned school building in rural Colorado. I lived there for 6 years, without plumbing, central heat, or full electricity. Isolated and disconnected from a community, my mother's hoarding took over a lot of the space. It was a strange and challenging place to grow up. My parents have since moved to the closest town, 40 minutes away, leaving the school house abandoned once again. Two years ago, my mother was in a serious bike accident, suffering severe brain damage. I started taking trips back home to help my father care for my mother. In revisiting my past, I realized there was much that was unresolved within me that I had been avoiding. 

Last summer I decided to go back to this building after a decade away, to live and work there alone, creating art pieces from materials I found in the building. Living in isolation (no internet or cell phone) and surrounded by my memories and family history, I used the experience of transforming physical materials as a way to transform my relationship to my story. With my mother's damaged mind, I am not able to communicate and connect with her as I did before. This project is also a way for me to learn about and connect to her through the lifetime of things she has held onto, and a way to use my challenges as fuel to focus on and create beauty and love. 
I am eager to get back to Colorado and continue this series of work with the intention of putting together a solo show in NYC, owning and sharing my story with others. This is my most vulnerable and authentic work to date. 
How funds will be used:


To continue making
this body of work, I need help with funding this project and supporting my
family. 

Expenses:

Packaging/shipping of finished pieces to NYC in November: $3000
Gallery Space rental: $500/dayx5 days: $2500

Travel: Thatcher trip (September-October) -
     air fare, cars, and gas: $800
Basic art supplies (tarps/adhesive/tools/resin/wood):
     $500
Temporary storage for pieces before show in NYC: $200


If
I surpass my campaign goal, additional funds will go towards stretch goals:

Care for my mother for 4 days (so my father can see the
     show in NYC): $1200

Extended dates for exhibition: $500/day
Longer care for my mother: $300/day


Perks:
I'm offering some great perks as incentive to those who can donate
* VIP tickets to the exhibition in November. This VIP showing 
will be a sneak peak of the finished show in NYC, with drinks, music, 
and great company. * Exclusive access to artist's web 
blog, with behind the scenes info, images, and video of my life in 
Thatcher and my process for this project. A great perk for anyone 
interested in knowing more about this journey. 
* Prints showcasing the natural beauty and golden light of Thatcher, with multiple sizing and framing options.  See options here


* Original art pieces from this project. I am making available many works of art from this Thatcher series as a pre-sale to the final exhibition in NYC. They are available for pick up after the show, or can be shipped domestically at an additional cost. Note that many of the pieces are large and heavy. More images here

<h3>About ArtsFest</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Allentown ArtsFest was created in 2014 as an
alternative to the modern art festival. The event strives to fill in gaps
frequently left by festival programming. Many talented artists miss out on their
chance to get involved in such an event due to being too different or not
fitting a mold. ArtsFest has no mold, it’s an event that is always searching
for something people have rarely seen. </p>
<p>The mission of ArtsFest is to challenge
not only <i>‘what is art?’</i> but also what
art <i>can be</i>. For this reason, ArtsFest
covers a wide variety of mediums, such as: graffiti, stand-up comedy,
technology, upcylcing, assemblage sculpture, dance, film, theater, spoken word, and a vast range of
musical genres. The festival is run solely by volunteers and will always be
FREE for everyone, of all ages. </p>
<p>2014 saw nearly 6,000 guests in attendance and 2015 is expected to draw more than 10,000! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438209957/vmqcexon7txq36tznf0m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>We Want YOU To Sponsor ArtsFest! </h3>
<div>The festival does not currently have any major corporate sponsorships. It is too unique and too new of an event for many larger companies to take a gamble on. And at the same time, we will only work with companies &amp; organizations that reflect the mission and idea behind ArtsFest. We won't take money from just any company and slap their logo on our brand. ArtsFest is important to us, we want it to stay pure and will not sacrifice our morals for funding! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are more interested in working with small businesses and individuals as sponsors. It gives those involved a feeling of ownership in the event and it builds on the community aspect that the organization was founded on. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We'd rather have small sponsors who support what we do and want to be on the front lines with us, much more so than some faceless company who wants to promote their new product! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So that means we need YOU to step up and help ensure ArtsFest keeps going for many years to come! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438205035/orsfrjrfaoxwzktqjibu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Why Are Sponsorships Important? </span><br/></p></div>
</div><div> <p>The only way funding comes in for ArtsFest is through vendor booths, grants, donations &amp; sponsorships. </p>
<p>We've already covered the sponsorship category... and we're a very new Non-Profit (March 2015), which hasn't given us enough time to receive grant money. So the only other funding that comes through for us is from vendor booths and donations. </p>
<p>Our vendor booths are VERY reasonably priced, if you compare them to other festivals of this size or smaller, they are actually pretty cheap. We do this to help ensure that our vendors make money off of the event. This means the vendor booths are only able to cover a small percentage of the total cost of the festival. </p>
<p>Donations come in many forms; this could mean a company donates use of equipment instead of having to outright pay for it, that cost would be calculated and they would become a sponsor at that price range. Since we're a Non-Profit, all financial support, regardless of where it's from, is a donation. Which makes the contributor a donor. This is how many companies such as PBS or NPR stick around. </p>
<p>We've had a handful of donations, but nothing to put a dent in the actual cost of the festival. Which again, leaves the best avenue for covering the rest of the funds in the hands of the sponsors! </p>
<p>The only other funding that comes through for us is that we actually handle the sales of all alcohol. Being a non-profit, we are able to apply for a limited liquor license through the Liquor Control Board and sell alcohol legally. But this means more costs, much more. We have to buy all of the alcohol up front, and as last year proved, that can be a costly venture. Because of the long rainy day last year, not enough people bought the amount of beer needed to cover expenses and it only put us FURTHER in the hole! </p>
<p>We will be selling delicious craft beers again this year from Sly Fox, Hijinx,
The Other Farm, Saucony Creek, Funk Brewing &amp; newcomer Soul Brewing. Our goal is to go INTO ArtsFest breaking even so that any profit will fund future gallery programs. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Cost of Doing Business</h3> <p>Now that we've covered how the festival relies on paying its bills, one thing that hasn't been covered is the COST of running a festival such as this. </p>
<p>For those who haven't been involved in organizing outdoor events, there are A LOT of expenses that you would never expect to have to pay. </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Fencing in the entire festival ($4,300)</li>
<li>Tents, tables &amp; chairs ($2,500)</li>
<li>Generators &amp; Lights ($2,500)</li>
<li>Stage, stage equipment, backline &amp; sound team ($4,300)</li>
<li>Portable restrooms &amp; hand washing stations ($2,800)</li>
<li>Allentown Police Department, EMT, Fire Police &amp; Overnight Security ($6,000)</li>
<li>Insurance ($3,000)</li>
<li>Water, Dumpsters &amp; Trash Removal ($1,000)</li>
<li>Clean Team ($900)</li>
<li>Permits/Fees/Licenses ($500)</li>
<li>Advertising/Merch ($2,500)</li>
<li>Cups &amp; Beverages/Beer ($5,000)</li>
</ul>
<div><b>TOTAL = $35,300</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And that's not even ALL of the expenses. Those are rough estimates of some of the things we had to pay for, with probably another $4,000-5,000 in addition to that. Which means ArtsFest costs about <b>$40,000</b> to put on! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Once you start to break it down, even <b>$8,000</b> doesn't go a long way. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In 2014, the festival made nearly <b>$30k LESS</b> than what the bills added up to. Which meant the Alternative Gallery spent the better part of the year paying off those expenses out of pocket. That's no small amount of money either, imagine what programs we could have created or what else we could have used that money for.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our goal for 2015 is to go into ArtsFest breaking even, so for the next year, we can fund MANY more programs. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ALL funding obtained through this fundraiser will cover some of our larger expenses such as fencing &amp; staging. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What's In It For Me? </h3>
<div>Aside from that awesome fuzzy feeling you get all over from doing a good thing and supporting a community event, there are some really great perks for becoming an individual sponsor of ArtsFest. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We've taken the time to see what people like to take home with them from festivals, art shows, looked through cool perks in other campaigns, and overall just tried to avoid giving away run of the mill items. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>NOTE: </b>We WILL ship International, please message us with your location to determine shipping rate.</div>
<div><br/></div>
Obviously one of the things people love the most are shirts. Shirts can be a way to promote something you love or support, they can give you a clear voice without having to say a word, or even offer insight into what kind of stuff you like. 
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So this year we have 3 different shirts for ArtsFest! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our first shirt is the ArtsFest Logo Shirt. This is a 1-color screen print on a cotton shirt. We had these last year and they've become a crowd favorite so we brought it back! IMPORTANT: Make sure you note what size shirt you need and select either White or Black shirt.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438179666/frpzgr15uh7d8pphcj20.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
</div>
<div>Our second shirt is the ArtsFest 2015 Shirt. This is a 1-color screen print on a cotton shirt. IMPORTANT: Make sure you note what size shirt you need and select from the following color shirts: Red, Green, Yellow or Blue. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438119175/f4wj9evgfkc5hpyaeqbp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Finally, we have the big daddy of the shirts, the FULL COLOR ArtsFest 2015 shirt! The additional colors makes this much more difficult to make and more expensive! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These are limited edition so get yours while you can! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Again, please note what SIZE you need. These shirts will only be printed on white. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438116712/ya5rdb24t9fkxnzclnxr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Next we have the poster for ArtsFest 2015 by artist Steven Leibensperger.</p>
<p>The $10 level will get you a regular 11x17 poster print.</p>
<p>The $100 level will get you a 18x24 beautiful EXCLUSIVE velvet poster print.</p>
<p>And the $250 level will get you a hand signed &amp; numbered Limited Edition Full Color Screen Printed Poster! </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438205209/zwber0ptfklcbx0g5fcs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>And for those of you unfamiliar with the Alternative Gallery, the organization that hosts ArtsFest, we do this type of stuff all year long! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>The Alternative Gallery is a Non-Profit (501-c3)
organization founded in 2012 in Allentown, PA. The mission of the gallery is to
strengthen communities through art and education. The Alternative Gallery aims
to create a space that is open and welcoming to all, and involves those who
wouldn’t typically enter an art gallery. Located in the Cigar Factory, the
Alternative Gallery hosts hundreds of events a year including live music, a
weekly open mic, dance competitions, art classes, screenings, workshops, art
exhibits &amp; more. </p>

Many of the events the Alternative Gallery hosts are free, but there are also a LOT of other events that are pay at the door. This is how we help to cover the expenses of running events and also help to pay the performers &amp; artists who take part in these events. </div>
<div>Starting at the $50 level, you can earn free entry into either events OR classes at the Alternative Gallery! </div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438205510/pi6uufz1v1y8tibem7zf.png"" src="""" style=""width: 355px; height: 355px;""/></p></div>
<br/>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p>
</div>
</div><div> <p>We know not everyone can spare the extra change to help support our cause, and that's ok! There are plenty of other ways you can pitch in and help us out! </p>
<p>Most importantly, would be sharing this campaign and letting people know what we're doing. We want to keep ArtsFest as grassroots as possible and word of mouth is as grassroots as it gets! </p>
<p>You can also invite people to attend ArtsFest when it happens, from Sep. 11-13th. It is after all a FREE event! </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1601064986812559/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1601064986812559/</a><br/></p>
<p>And of course, ArtsFest is only able to happen at all because of the amazing team of volunteers we have running it. Literally every single person from the Event Coordinator to a 1-shift volunteer does this solely for the support of the cause. </p>
<p>You can easily sign-up to volunteer by following this link: </p>

Our second shirt is the ArtsFest 2015 Shirt. This is a 1-color screen print on a cotton shirt. IMPORTANT: Make sure you note what size shirt you need and select from the following color shirts: Red, Green, Yellow or Blue. 




Finally, we have the big daddy of the shirts, the FULL COLOR ArtsFest 2015 shirt! The additional colors makes this much more difficult to make and more expensive! 

These are limited edition so get yours while you can! 

Again, please note what SIZE you need. These shirts will only be printed on white. 





Next we have the poster for ArtsFest 2015 by artist Steven Leibensperger.
The $10 level will get you a regular 11x17 poster print.
The $100 level will get you a 18x24 beautiful EXCLUSIVE velvet poster print.
And the $250 level will get you a hand signed & numbered Limited Edition Full Color Screen Printed Poster! 


And for those of you unfamiliar with the Alternative Gallery, the organization that hosts ArtsFest, we do this type of stuff all year long! 


The Alternative Gallery is a Non-Profit (501-c3)
organization founded in 2012 in Allentown, PA. The mission of the gallery is to
strengthen communities through art and education. The Alternative Gallery aims
to create a space that is open and welcoming to all, and involves those who
wouldn’t typically enter an art gallery. Located in the Cigar Factory, the
Alternative Gallery hosts hundreds of events a year including live music, a
weekly open mic, dance competitions, art classes, screenings, workshops, art
exhibits & more. 

Many of the events the Alternative Gallery hosts are free, but there are also a LOT of other events that are pay at the door. This is how we help to cover the expenses of running events and also help to pay the performers & artists who take part in these events. 
Starting at the $50 level, you can earn free entry into either events OR classes at the Alternative Gallery! 


Other Ways You Can Help

 We know not everyone can spare the extra change to help support our cause, and that's ok! There are plenty of other ways you can pitch in and help us out! 
Most importantly, would be sharing this campaign and letting people know what we're doing. We want to keep ArtsFest as grassroots as possible and word of mouth is as grassroots as it gets! 
You can also invite people to attend ArtsFest when it happens, from Sep. 11-13th. It is after all a FREE event! 
https://www.facebook.com/events/1601064986812559/
And of course, ArtsFest is only able to happen at all because of the amazing team of volunteers we have running it. Literally every single person from the Event Coordinator to a 1-shift volunteer does this solely for the support of the cause. 
You can easily sign-up to volunteer by following this link: 
http://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c054baaaa2aaaf...
We thank you for even taking the time to read this far, you must REALLY love the arts! 
Thank you all and we hope to see you at ArtsFest 2015!

This Project started on the occasion of a 3day Workshop in Children's Book Illustration but soon it became a personal goal. 


Conceptual Approach


The symbolism of the heroin as a drop of blood (Menstruation) while a forest of fingerprints denotes the formation of her identity was my first idea of this book, but was quickly abandoned for being ""too adult"" (see Images in Gallery).

From then on I chose the deduction to the Basic Shapes and Colors: the Red Circle for the Heroine, symbol of her journey to womanhood and a friendly color loved by many, the Yellow Square and the enclosed Curves for the Granny, metaphor of her protective nature, that never reaches the girl and the Blue Triangle for the Wolf, the cold-blooded beast that acts upon its instincts.


The funny thing is, although I had decided on this semiology rather easily, I ended up designing a much more lovable wolf than the heroin herself. For that I blame me and my gluttonous nature! ^_^

<br/>
This campaign is critical to my success at my upcoming shows. I have been a fine art and musician for most of my life, let's age me and just say 30+ years. Yup, That's right, I started piano at 4 and drawing in my teens.   I have graduated to fine art showings recently, which means my display is critical to acceptance, and in some cases will enable me to compete for prize money to grow my art collection.  The long-term goal is to own a gallery to support other emerging artists in a few years, but I have to pay my dues and my roots start at shows, thus this fundraiser. <br/>This is an all or none campaign and all contributions have a perk.<br/><i><br/>""Every contribution makes a difference, plus the perks are awesome.  I love sharing my passion for the arts with my fans, perks are a way of saying thank you and paying it forward."" <br/></i><br/>You can read more about me, my artist statement, bio, etc. at the bottom of the page.  <i> </i><br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What MiMi Needs &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> </ul>For the record, I am invested into my art.  In the span of the past 2-years since officially opening as an artist in business, my investment to date is towering over $6,000. Yes, Ouch! But, fans love the work, I am being accepted into shows. Online art is very, very , hard to sale. Showing in person is the ticket, this is where the tire meets the road.  I need to show more in order to get out of this emerging artist funk, because I am not really emerging if you count the past 30 years of my artistic life. <br/>  <br/>What I need to keep the momentum going...<ul>
<li>Replacement Tent, Mesh Walls, Hooks, Shipping - $2,000 <br/>
</li>
<li>Show Fees (just the next 3) $1,000<br/>
</li>
<li>Remaining 2-D Art Supplies (this is the 20 in 10) $500<br/>
</li>
<li>Show Supplies $500<br/>
</li>
<li>Travel and Lodging $500<br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>Please help me reach my goal so I can make not only
make the next 3 shows happen, but give me the boost so I can be successful now
by selling the art I love, and also reserving money earned from shows to
eventually open a gallery to support those artists out there who need help -
seriously this goal is part of a bigger dream - the grand goal, long-term, is
opening doors for great artist who need a helping hand in getting their work shown
less the bureaucratic garbage that stifles creativity for emerging artists. I
would like to step away from traditional gallery rules and re-write the book.</p>Successes to date include:<ul>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>About Me  - MiMi Stirn</h3>
<p>No this is not another boring resume, but it is a long-winded artist statement and bio, just so you know... I am legit...</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<p>Statement: My favorite art tools are knives. They are unforgiven yet clear and 
finite when used. Working within the acrylic family is fun, but working 
with modeling paste is where the art begins; free form and each 
application remind me of swimming. What I love best about creating art 
is the freedom of expression without fear of consequence. When I am able
 to say a work has turned out well, is actually the moment when I can 
return to the art over the course of several days and repeatedly be 
transported into the picture itself.</p>
<p>The pattern or usual styles I use are centered on both working with 
circular and straight line motions while respecting Fibonacci sequences 
in the placement of each element; however, bright light, layers of 
color, and use of metallic pigments are my standard. What I do 
differently from what I was taught is dirty brushing. My brushes &amp; 
knives during the painting process are usually lapped with new colors 
without actually washing them; I love the mystery of the blends, and the
 picture always turns out beautiful. My favorite color on the spectrum 
is Prussian blue, and is usually incorporated in to my skies, water 
scenes, and shadowing.</p>
<p></p>
</div>Short Bio: My
early works began in the late 80’s, mainly sketches using coal and colored
pencils.  In 1996 I began working with
oils and acrylics in a folk art style with subjects including animal
miniatures, farms, flowers, trees, and field animals.  I completed several
full-length wall murals during this time. In 2010, my husband and I moved to
Cape Coral Florida from Washington State.  I was inspired to change my
artistic styling from folk art to abstract works with focus on ample, bold
colors.  The beautiful sunrise, sunsets, and of course, the cute burrowing
owls, native to our area, opened the door rekindle my passion for painting and
expand my art skills.  Additional inspiration comes from years of
traveling as a military brat and spouse.  I have been blessed to see the
beautiful landscapes and wildlife from growing-up in Guam, Louisiana, Germany,
New Mexico, and Washington.  <br/><p><span>
<br/>
My focus these past 5-years has been abstract color techniques including
blending, staining, resin pours, and subtraction processes.  All artwork is on gallery
wrapped canvas, ranging from 10” X 10” up to 60” x 60”. <br/></span></p>
<span>I have my degree in Business Administration, am
a Florida State Certified Business Consultant, and a Certified Marketing
Strategist through Cornell University. My
husband and I have two grown sons and are looking forward to grandchildren and our
exciting new life in Florida. I also am
an avid paddle boarder, acoustic guitarist and pianist, and enjoy cooking. Mastering the
art of color and nature is my first passion and I am elated to share my artwork
with you.<br/>

Passion: Painting followed by guitar, piano, cooking, and paddleboarding 

Goal:  Raise funds for new tent and 3 art shows, ultimately saving up to open up a different kind of rocking  ""ART GALLERY"" within the next 3 years.  

Art Medium this campaign is supporting - 2D Mixed Media Art
Why A Campaign #1: The 2D Media Art has taken off and I have been selected to show all the new 2D work - and I need a replacement tent


Why #2:  My tent, a loaner from a fellow artist (I am so sorry Claude and Debbie), along with all of my art walls were destroyed this summer during a huge, hurricane gust wind storm at an art show.  I am now up for 3 shows and need a new tent, and just as important, stock up the now growing popular MiMi's 2D Mixed Media collection, thus 20 paintings in 10 weeks for 3 shows




This campaign is critical to my success at my upcoming shows. I have been a fine art and musician for most of my life, let's age me and just say 30+ years. Yup, That's right, I started piano at 4 and drawing in my teens.   I have graduated to fine art showings recently, which means my display is critical to acceptance, and in some cases will enable me to compete for prize money to grow my art collection.  The long-term goal is to own a gallery to support other emerging artists in a few years, but I have to pay my dues and my roots start at shows, thus this fundraiser. This is an all or none campaign and all contributions have a perk.""Every contribution makes a difference, plus the perks are awesome.  I love sharing my passion for the arts with my fans, perks are a way of saying thank you and paying it forward."" You can read more about me, my artist statement, bio, etc. at the bottom of the page.       What MiMi Needs & What You Get  For the record, I am invested into my art.  In the span of the past 2-years since officially opening as an artist in business, my investment to date is towering over $6,000. Yes, Ouch! But, fans love the work, I am being accepted into shows. Online art is very, very , hard to sale. Showing in person is the ticket, this is where the tire meets the road.  I need to show more in order to get out of this emerging artist funk, because I am not really emerging if you count the past 30 years of my artistic life.   What I need to keep the momentum going...
Replacement Tent, Mesh Walls, Hooks, Shipping - $2,000 

Show Fees (just the next 3) $1,000

Remaining 2-D Art Supplies (this is the 20 in 10) $500

Show Supplies $500

Travel and Lodging $500
 
OK -  Now... The PERKS!  They ROCK! I have perks for everyone from the $5 level to the $1,000 level... Below are pictures the perks and you can read more in the actual ""Perk"" section.  I will be posting weekly video snip its of progress on the creation of the 20 in 10 collection during this campaign.  Here are original paintings at the $150 level - 1 of each available, all 20 x 20 on gallery wrapped canvas

Here are original paintings at the $125 level - 1 of each available, all on gallery wrapped canvas 

NOTE: Below are examples and for phone cases, necklaces, totes, and 
posters, I will contact you so you can select the art you want on the 
perk.  Anything with the logo i.e. shirts, hot sauce, and stickers, 
those are as is.  Original painting perks come with other perks -

<p>Your money will be used for the printing and publication of the 
artbook. All other costs (like copic markers &amp; other drawing 
materials) will be paid with the money from my own pocket. Vegan Artbook
 has been a non-profit project until now. The previous book (SPICY) was a
 free book and people only paid for printing and shipping costs. I think
 that, for a project like this, money isn't important. The most 
important thing is spreading compassion and literally save lives that 
way.</p>

</div></div>","Many
 people don't like reading a lot of text, so the 2-panel comics and art 
in the Vegan Artbook are the perfect solution to spread the vegan 
message in a creative and thought-provoking way.The Vegan Artbook MILD contains 320 pages of 
colourful artwork and comics, focused on veganism, ethics, the 
environment, food, peace, love and animals. Aside from spreading 
cuteness, the book also raises awareness and shows people how they can 
make healthier and more ethical choices in their daily lives... all via artwork and mini-comics.These unique books are therefore the perfect gift for vegans and 
vegetarians or people who are interested in this ethical life 
philosophy. Because of the colourful cartoonish art style, the books 
especially aim at people who are visually oriented and young people such
 as teenagers (who often don’t like to read a lot of text) and it teaches 
our future generations how to make the world a better place. This book is free of gory images, so it's suitable for people of all ages.I've been working on these books for many months but because I am still 
studying, I lack the funds to publish the Vegan Artbook MILD. The Vegan 
Artbook MILD is planned for an september release and I need your help to 
make it happen. If you think my project is valuable, please help me 
realize it by helping me fund the publication of this book. Everything 
will be produced environmentally friendly, but also in very high quality
 on smooth recycled paper! Printing a full-colour book like this with 
320 pages in small quantities is quite expensive here, so I'll be very 
grateful for every bit of help I can get on this.

This is one of the unique VAB mugs you will receive if you claim reward 8, 9 or 10. There is also a different design availible.
Your money will be used for the printing and publication of the 
artbook. All other costs (like copic markers & other drawing 
materials) will be paid with the money from my own pocket. Vegan Artbook
 has been a non-profit project until now. The previous book (SPICY) was a
 free book and people only paid for printing and shipping costs. I think
 that, for a project like this, money isn't important. The most 
important thing is spreading compassion and literally save lives that 
way.
Don't forget to check the video for more information! And please share a link to this crowdfunding page!Thank you everyone! I love you all!",18.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<b>Hello and welcome to <i>Moments of Joy</i></b>
</h3>This is art that tells a story—about living with Alzheimer’s.  It’s
never easy but there are moments of joy—sometimes a lot, sometimes not so
much—but joy nonetheless. <br/><br/>
<p>In
the first exhibition of its kind in Seattle, this surprising, delightful and
inspiring art will allow us to experience these moments—opening hearts and
minds to remarkable people.<span>  At <i>Moments
of Joy</i>, intriguing art creates a different way of thinking about dementia,
enabling us to see that—though they have changed—they are <i>still here</i>,
living with dignity, creativity and joy.</span></p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p>

<i>This turns everything I thought I knew about
Alzheimer’s on its head.  I thought of these people—if I thought of them at all—as gone, as no longer of
value and these paintings just changed that completely.  And what is so
wonderful about the exhibition is that we can meet them as artists—as people—as people we care about.   Liz H.</i><b></b><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>About the Exhibition</b></p>
<p>Free and open to all, the exhibition will feature fascinating paintings
by nearly 40 people, aged 60 to 96, who live with dementia.  Opening at Seattle City Hall’s Lobby Gallery &amp; Anne Focke Gallery on January 8,
2016 and on view to the public through February 26, 2016 in partnership with
Seattle’s Office of Arts and Culture.  And there’s more…</p>
<p>Throughout
the seven weeks of the exhibition, we will present a series of activities developed
in concert with exhibit partners – catalysts for knowledge, empathy,
creativity and involvement.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Gallery
walks, panel discussions, guest speakers and performances reflecting diverse perspectives—artists,
caregivers, students, neurologists, social workers, policy makers and people
living with dementia. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A series
of free outreach painting classes expanding access to these valuable arts
programs. </p>

<b>The inspiration

</b><p><b>In Loving Memory of Jean McFee Raichle – March 28, 1919 – April 19, 2015</b></p>
<p>I was raised in the shadow of Alzheimer’s with nearly
everyone on my father’s side and many in mother’s developing the disease. 
We were taught that when Alzheimer’s arrived, it was like a death—actually
worse than death.  Our parents warned us, “Don’t sacrifice your lives for
us.  When our time comes, just walk away<i>.”</i> And I believed
it.  </p>
<p>And then Mom began to paint.  The paintings were amazing.  She had
never painted a day in her life yet these paintings were really good, always
interesting and sometimes remarkable.  And slowly, I began to
understand.  She may have had a short term memory of about ten seconds,
but she was <i>still here</i>—loving, creative and joyful.  I began to
share the art with others and the reaction was always the same—delight,
surprise and gratitude to experience a story about Alzheimer’s with hope and
joy—a continual discovery of what it means to be human.</p>

This is art that tells a story—about living with Alzheimer’s.  It’s
never easy but there are moments of joy—sometimes a lot, sometimes not so
much—but joy nonetheless. 
In
the first exhibition of its kind in Seattle, this surprising, delightful and
inspiring art will allow us to experience these moments—opening hearts and
minds to remarkable people.  At Moments
of Joy, intriguing art creates a different way of thinking about dementia,
enabling us to see that—though they have changed—they are still here,
living with dignity, creativity and joy.


This turns everything I thought I knew about
Alzheimer’s on its head.  I thought of these people—if I thought of them at all—as gone, as no longer of
value and these paintings just changed that completely.  And what is so
wonderful about the exhibition is that we can meet them as artists—as people—as people we care about.   Liz H.
About the Exhibition
Free and open to all, the exhibition will feature fascinating paintings
by nearly 40 people, aged 60 to 96, who live with dementia.  Opening at Seattle City Hall’s Lobby Gallery & Anne Focke Gallery on January 8,
2016 and on view to the public through February 26, 2016 in partnership with
Seattle’s Office of Arts and Culture.  And there’s more…
Throughout
the seven weeks of the exhibition, we will present a series of activities developed
in concert with exhibit partners – catalysts for knowledge, empathy,
creativity and involvement.
· 
Gallery
walks, panel discussions, guest speakers and performances reflecting diverse perspectives—artists,
caregivers, students, neurologists, social workers, policy makers and people
living with dementia. 
· 
A series
of free outreach painting classes expanding access to these valuable arts
programs. 
· 
A Word
Cloud showing us the impact of the art in real time as attendees answer the question,
“What word describes this exhibition?” 




The inspiration

In Loving Memory of Jean McFee Raichle – March 28, 1919 – April 19, 2015
I was raised in the shadow of Alzheimer’s with nearly
everyone on my father’s side and many in mother’s developing the disease. 
We were taught that when Alzheimer’s arrived, it was like a death—actually
worse than death.  Our parents warned us, “Don’t sacrifice your lives for
us.  When our time comes, just walk away.” And I believed
it.  
And then Mom began to paint.  The paintings were amazing.  She had
never painted a day in her life yet these paintings were really good, always
interesting and sometimes remarkable.  And slowly, I began to
understand.  She may have had a short term memory of about ten seconds,
but she was still here—loving, creative and joyful.  I began to
share the art with others and the reaction was always the same—delight,
surprise and gratitude to experience a story about Alzheimer’s with hope and
joy—a continual discovery of what it means to be human.



Fascinating. If you believe art is a medium for
communication, it appears this woman has more than a few things to say to us.  Kitty S.
The impact
While Alzheimer’s is scary, art isn’t.  It is our hope that the exhibition will encourage
a leap from fear to connection, creative thinking and involvement.  Leading to real conversations about how to
build a dementia friendly community—more inclusive, more engaging, more
supportive and more hopeful for everyone whose lives are touched by dementia.  And if we are really lucky, we will become better stewards of an aging population—which, after all, ultimately means
all of us.




What
will your money do?

Your contribution will help us fund
the final $4,625 needed to launch the initial exhibition.

individuals, we have raised $19,350 with a pledge of $5,000 waiting in the
wings.  This leaves us with $4,625 left to
raise to fully fund the project.  
·  The biggest chunk goes to the framing of the art.  All of the
paintings are on loan from the artists and their families with our promise that
we will return them in good condition and professionally framed.  
·  Then comes the design and printing of exhibit materials: the
postcards and catalog of all the 
exhibited works as well as wall titles/tags/display boards 
·  Marketing and outreach to spread the word

·  And finally, eight free outreach art classes

Dhaka City is the size of my small home county of Fayette, in Kentucky, but holds nearly 4 times the number of people in my entire state! Everything was different, it seemed. <i>Until I realized it wasn't</i>. In fact, despite the glaring difference, it reminded of my Appalachian home, particularly. Huh? Because, people are <i>absolutely more alike than different</i>. Like Bangladeshis, we in Appalachia we know a thing or two about fishing, about beautiful land and the cost of its use, and about making due. But, conventional power media emphasizes difference. Muslim vs. Christian, Brown vs. White, Them vs. Us. I came home eager to ""do something"". But what could be done? </p>
<p>It took five years and another visit to come to realize a vision. My wish was to enable real and deep connection in a way that bypassed conventional media. I met a writer, Robert Gipe, teaching in Harlan, Kentucky. I made my pitch—""Your students are told every day that Muslims are the enemy. That the other side of the world is alien, and that we are free to exploit them. I know better. Students in Dhaka are just like students in Kentucky.</p>
<p>I created the website <a href=""http://www.harlanxdhaka.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harlan X Dhaka </a>(pronounced Harlan ""by"" Dhaka). I designed this simple format: Both participants upload their pictures as ""seeds"". Then, the students choose to match their photos into pairs called <a href=""http://www.harlanxdhaka.com/threads-2447245324882457250924552503-245924762495.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Threads</a> . These threads become the art of the effort: a series of pieces celebrating the commonality.</p>
<p>Place X Place is a teaching tool based on Harlan x Dhaka. The premise is simple: starting with the presumption of mutual ignorance, and of distance, two groups of people will use contemporary technology and playfully create ""rhyming images"". The results are artistic, educational, resonant. Please see Harlan X Dhaka for example.</p>
<p>With your help our team will build a web-based tool based on the architecture of Harlan X Dhaka that will enable any two groups of people to pair up and have a similar exchange.</p>
<p>Our vision includes:</p>
<p>A stand alone web tool.</p>
<p>Portability across all platforms.</p>
<p>Easy-to-use functionality.</p>
<p>Scalability and ease-of-management.</p>
<p>Ability to 'sign on' with a paired city in mind, or, to sign up as a 'single' (for example: 7th grade classroom in Santa Fe, New Mexico seeks similar outside North America).</p>
<p>Option to order end of project product to commemorate experience, such as classroom poster or book.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We need money to universalize the format as Place x Place, and to advertise and publish the tool using web designers.</li> <li>At $20 or more, you will be named as a contributor on the website and receive a magnet bearing one of the original paired images. At $50 or more, you'll receive the magnet, a t-shirt bearing an original image and credit. At $500, you'll receive recognition as a Founder, plus all other gifts.</li> <li>We will hire web developers and technical writers to create an air-tight, scalable format for Place x Place; we will buy more time to keep Harlan x Dhaka up; we will fulfill, insofar as possible, our original goal to share the ability to follow this format via a general website.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will provide a ""plug and play"" tool that will enable teachers, leaders, or any other motivators to learn and share globally, with a beautiful end result at very little cost:</p> <ul> <li>Without participation, we turn judgmental and arrogant. With investment, we become interested and compassionate.</li> <li>I have experience making art on a shoestring. With the help of a few friends, I created and directed the film <a href=""https://vimeo.com/82029388"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elbow of Light</a> for less than $20,000.00<span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Place x Place isn't about a product, but about the process of seeing, sharing, and creating by the participants. Harlan x Dhaka is evidence that it works.</span></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Reaching across cultural, political and religious lines can be scary. This project needs to be simple, above all.</p>
<p>With a good format, and simple architecture, we can enable leaders to overcome these challenges.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Most of our expenses are for skilled web-builders. You can volunteer to help! </p>

Then, the students choose to match their photos into pairs called Threads . These threads become the art of the effort: a series of pieces celebrating the commonality.
Place X Place is a teaching tool based on Harlan x Dhaka. The premise is simple: starting with the presumption of mutual ignorance, and of distance, two groups of people will use contemporary technology and playfully create ""rhyming images"". The results are artistic, educational, resonant. Please see Harlan X Dhaka for example.
With your help our team will build a web-based tool based on the architecture of Harlan X Dhaka that will enable any two groups of people to pair up and have a similar exchange.
Our vision includes:
A stand alone web tool.
Portability across all platforms.
Easy-to-use functionality.
Scalability and ease-of-management.
Ability to 'sign on' with a paired city in mind, or, to sign up as a 'single' (for example: 7th grade classroom in Santa Fe, New Mexico seeks similar outside North America).
Option to order end of project product to commemorate experience, such as classroom poster or book.
   What We Need & What You Get  We need money to universalize the format as Place x Place, and to advertise and publish the tool using web designers. At $20 or more, you will be named as a contributor on the website and receive a magnet bearing one of the original paired images. At $50 or more, you'll receive the magnet, a t-shirt bearing an original image and credit. At $500, you'll receive recognition as a Founder, plus all other gifts. We will hire web developers and technical writers to create an air-tight, scalable format for Place x Place; we will buy more time to keep Harlan x Dhaka up; we will fulfill, insofar as possible, our original goal to share the ability to follow this format via a general website.    The Impact Your contribution will provide a ""plug and play"" tool that will enable teachers, leaders, or any other motivators to learn and share globally, with a beautiful end result at very little cost:  Without participation, we turn judgmental and arrogant. With investment, we become interested and compassionate. I have experience making art on a shoestring. With the help of a few friends, I created and directed the film Elbow of Light for less than $20,000.00.

Place x Place isn't about a product, but about the process of seeing, sharing, and creating by the participants. Harlan x Dhaka is evidence that it works.    Risks & Challenges Reaching across cultural, political and religious lines can be scary. This project needs to be simple, above all.
With a good format, and simple architecture, we can enable leaders to overcome these challenges.   Other Ways You Can Help Most of our expenses are for skilled web-builders. You can volunteer to help!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I began my creative journey many years ago in Nairn Academy where I was inspired and encouraged by a fantastic art teacher.  I then moved on to Inverness College to prepare my portfolio with the intention of moving on to university to study the subject in depth. Here I met my future husband and my wonderful life took over. </p>
<p> It was some 20 years later when my children were becoming more independent that I picked up my art tools again and my passion was reignited.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I create my art using different textiles and fibres, one of the main techniques I use is called needle felting.</p>
<p>Needle felting is bonding fibres together using a sharp barbed needle that is repeatedly stabbed through the fibres.  These fibres are layered like paint to give each piece a depth and vibrancy that brings them to life.</p>
<p>Art has given me confidence in myself and my abilities both as an artist and as an educator.  I have been teaching others the technique of needle felting for the past two years in various locations within the local area.  People of all ages and abilities have attended these classes where I take them through the techniques needed to transform my vast range of fibres  into their own unique piece of art.  These workshops have led to people taking up needle felting as a hobby and some have even made a business out of it,  I am proud to have been part part of their creative journeys.</p>

<p>Our version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fully illustrated 300-page hardcover book, made up of 150 pages of text and 150 vibrant illustrations accompanying each page. We restyled the original text into 150 segments, and sent each piece to an artist to imagine that piece in their own way.</p>
<p>The result is a unique edition showcasing varied art styles from all over the world. It is also a chance for the artists to showcase their own skills, and most importantly, a chance for us, the artists, <b>and you</b>, to give back to society through art.</p>
<p>Each book measures 28x28x3.5cm, weighs a hefty 3kg, and is sure to add colour to your living room, and life to your coffee table. Now, Lewis Carroll will be pleased, won't he?</p>

<p>Lewis Carroll created Wonderland, and the story surrounding it, out of his love of entertaining children. 150 years later, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is still enjoyed by children all over the world through books, games, movies and art.</p>
<p>We are here to drive forward Lewis Carroll’s idea of encouraging art and creativity among children. With your generous support, we can help a generation of children develop a more vivid imagination.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>Our end goal is to build an art school in Mongolia, a place where children can go to learn, experiment and play with their <span style=""background-color: initial;"">imagination. For a start, we are working with the <b>Independent Research Institute of Mongolia</b> (IRIM) to conduct regular art classes at <b>Secondary School Number 3</b> in Zuunkharaa Soum, Selenge, Mongolia.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>These art classes, while held in the school, are also open to children in the neighbourhood. At class, children will learn various forms of art, from basic drawing and painting, to traditional Mongolian wood sculpturing. Through this, we hope to encourage them to find new opportunities for themselves, and add colour to their lives and communities.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p>All proceeds from the sale of the book and its related products will be used towards educating children in Mongolia about art and creativity. We are working with Mrs. Dash Oyunchimeg, the spouse of the Ambassador from Mongolia to China, to find partners in Mongolia who can help us make this dream a reality.</p>

<p>The 150Alice Project was born out of Pickatale's own vision for creative education and child literacy. At Pickatale, we do interactive children storybooks, and 150Alice is our side project to further help spread art and creative education which we see as a crucial part of every kid's childhood.</p>
<p>With your help, our dream of promoting healthy childhood development through art education and literacy can be achieved. Have you met the team yet? If not, now's the time to say hi!</p>

BUT we got 150 artists to recreate Lewis Carroll's classic into a unique, Sesquicentennial coffee-table edition. Join us now - as we journey to  Wonderland!


Disclaimer: Please note shipping prices at the end of this campaign page before backing.
150Alice is a project celebrating the 150th anniversary of Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.  We brought together 150 brilliant artists from 42 countries to promote their artwork in a unique way and give them an opportunity to create a masterpiece together.



   



Our version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a fully illustrated 300-page hardcover book, made up of 150 pages of text and 150 vibrant illustrations accompanying each page. We restyled the original text into 150 segments, and sent each piece to an artist to imagine that piece in their own way.
The result is a unique edition showcasing varied art styles from all over the world. It is also a chance for the artists to showcase their own skills, and most importantly, a chance for us, the artists, and you, to give back to society through art.
Each book measures 28x28x3.5cm, weighs a hefty 3kg, and is sure to add colour to your living room, and life to your coffee table. Now, Lewis Carroll will be pleased, won't he?























Lewis Carroll created Wonderland, and the story surrounding it, out of his love of entertaining children. 150 years later, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is still enjoyed by children all over the world through books, games, movies and art.
We are here to drive forward Lewis Carroll’s idea of encouraging art and creativity among children. With your generous support, we can help a generation of children develop a more vivid imagination.




Our end goal is to build an art school in Mongolia, a place where children can go to learn, experiment and play with their imagination. For a start, we are working with the Independent Research Institute of Mongolia (IRIM) to conduct regular art classes at Secondary School Number 3 in Zuunkharaa Soum, Selenge, Mongolia.

These art classes, while held in the school, are also open to children in the neighbourhood. At class, children will learn various forms of art, from basic drawing and painting, to traditional Mongolian wood sculpturing. Through this, we hope to encourage them to find new opportunities for themselves, and add colour to their lives and communities. 






All proceeds from the sale of the book and its related products will be used towards educating children in Mongolia about art and creativity. We are working with Mrs. Dash Oyunchimeg, the spouse of the Ambassador from Mongolia to China, to find partners in Mongolia who can help us make this dream a reality.














DISCLAIMER FOR UNITED STATES AND CANADA BACKERS: Please note that contrary to information found on Indiegogo's purchase page that shipping to these areas are free, they are not. Shipping charges will apply to these countries as well, with exact charges found in the full shipping list at the end of the campaign page.ALSO do note that although we mention that shipping is to be left out till the campaign is fully funded, backers may include shipping immediately when selecting their perk, as a side donation.

























    














We would love to deliver the books right to your doorstep, and that is exactly what we are going to do. But that is not something we can make happen as simply as it sounds, which is why we seek your understanding to add the appropriate shipping fees after selecting your perks.
The shipping  amount to be added is based on your location, which you can quickly refer to the map below for. For more detailed information, such as the full list of countries we can ship to and the exact cost to each country, please refer to the shipping list at the end of this campaign page.
Please note that for backers who live in countries where VAT and other import taxes apply, these additional fees are to be borne by the backer. The 150Alice team will not be held liable for any extra fees applicable within individual countries. We appreciate your kind understanding.









Hey, we are so sure you would love the book that this is what we're willing to do: all unsatisfied backers can exercise a 100% money back option within 30 days upon receiving the book. Simply write in to let us know and we will arrange for the return of the book. In exchange, you will receive the full amount of your pledge back. 

Too much of a hassle? We think so too, but don't worry for returning the book will not even be a consideration. Like we said, you will love it.
Now that you've gotten our guarantee that the purchase is risk-free, what are you waiting for? Hurry, back us now!






































The 150Alice Project was born out of Pickatale's own vision for creative education and child literacy. At Pickatale, we do interactive children storybooks, and 150Alice is our side project to further help spread art and creative education which we see as a crucial part of every kid's childhood.
With your help, our dream of promoting healthy childhood development through art education and literacy can be achieved. Have you met the team yet? If not, now's the time to say hi!

<h3>
<br/>ABOUT PROJECT</h3>
While at SFAI I'll focus on the following: 
<br/><ul>
<li>Working Project Title:<br/>VAGABOND<br/>
</li>
<li>Concepts:<br/>[1] Vanishing &amp; Loss<br/>Loss of one's cultural identity. I am interested in asking the question how does one maintain and 
preserve their culture? What is it like to not have either, how does one
 function and communicate with surrounding communities and environments around 
them? What is lost and what is gained? How does one maintain a sense of self?<br/>
</li>[2] Home <br/>How does one define and experience home? What different forms can it take? I will make and invite the public to make forms of <i>home</i>, referencing traditional and contemporary Southwest craft practices.<br/>
<li>Constructed Character:<br/>I will create <i>Nomadic </i>characters
who do not have a family, home, and who do not know their origin. They will find
their identity through communication with the people they meet, objects,
stories, and interaction with the land through their travels. <br/>
</li>
<li>Historical Reference:<br/>Throughout my work
I
will reference the history of the <a href=""http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/early-settlements/essays/pueblo-revolt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pueblo Revolt</a> as revisited by <a href=""http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520252059"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michal Wilcox in ‘The Pueblo Revolt and the Mythology of Conquest An Indigenous Archaeology of Contact</a><i>.' </i>I am interested in how this conflict liberated and
helped to persevere the identities of the Pueblo tribes in New Mexico. What
aspects of <i>self</i> were gained and what was lost that could not be regained?<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/></p>

<p><b>WOVEN BASKETS FOR THE 'OBJECTS OF HOME' </b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433879688/ajh4ilbukiqxgnfvvkwn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I have begun testing materials to hold the 'objects of home' that I will carry upon my back while performing in NM. I have decided to use outdoor safety &amp; utility rope for these forms. <b>**</b>  <br/>They come in a variety of colors and I am excited to begin mixing and testing which ones work best for the project.  <b><br/><br/></b><p><b>**NOTE</b>: There is a perk that offers the chance to get one of these smaller forms containing a special surprise nested inside. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>SCULPTURAL OBJECTS <br/>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431036053/umpfbsdmh6jno7rd3n6y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Special thanks to <a href=""http://www.emceecm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emcee C.M., Master of None</a> for assistance in construction.<br/><br/>Currently in production is a few object pieces I'll be using in my project. One is a four sided triangle form that opens up to become a compass with a graphic element, activate by a bell like form. It will help guild the nomadic characters as they move along the New Mexico landscape. <br/>Also, I am working on a modular construction made of units that can hold small objects that will be carried like a backpack, easily to put together and take apart like a tent. I aim to construct the pieces for this form here to assemble while at SFAI and add to if needed. <br/><br/><p></p>
<h3>
<br/>PUBLIC PARTICIPATION<br/>
</h3>
<p>I will invite the public who come to visit my studio at SFAI to
make <i>dolls-like forms in concept of home</i>. I am curious why one chooses these forms and what each means to them. What aspects of <i>home</i> gives one power and <i>identity. </i><br/></p>
<p>I will then take these forms with the ones
I have produced and bring them along with me to the desert using them in
constructed performance rituals. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1389982/files/20150416173302-Kachina_dolls_02.jpg?1429230782"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The forms I will be researching are <i><a href=""http://kachina.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kachina</a> dolls</i> made by
Pueblo tribes of the Southwest. These dolls are considered to be Spirit
beings; they
can represent anything in the natural world or cosmos, from a revered ancestor
to an element, a location, a quality, a natural phenomenon, or a concept.</p>
<p>I want to connect the idea that <i>home</i> can be more then just a room with four walls or a structure containing belongings. What symbols and ideas of <i>home</i> hold power for us, if so why? <br/><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div style=""""> <h3>PROJECT NEED<br/>
</h3>
<p>The support you give will help cover the following:</p>
<p><span><span></span></span>Residency Fee = $900<br/>
</p>
<p><span><span></span></span>Travel = $875<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Flight from to NYC to Albuquerque, New Mexico
$350</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Train to Santa Fe $30</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>I will also need a rental car to get around from
one shoot location to the other. Some locations are 1-3 hrs away from SFAI $165
week x 3 weeks= $ 495</li>
</ul>
<span>
Lodging = $300<br/>      Overnight stays at camping grounds and Airbnb rentals along travel routs.<br/><br/>
</span>Local Artist Hire = $200 +<br/>I am in the process of having an
earth wear piece produced by a local New Mexican artist in Santa Fe made of terracotta mixed from local earth to be used in the constructed performance rituals. This will not only give
me a chance to collaborate with a local artist but also help me support their
art practice. I will also be looking for performers to hire &amp; volunteer <span>for the project. <br/><br/>Total Funding Need: $ 2,275<br/></span><br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>PROJECT SIGNIFICANCE <br/>
</h3> <p>This project will bring a contemporary spotlight to the history of the first 
independent attempt by the <a href=""http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/early-settlements/essays/pueblo-revolt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pueblo tribes of Santa Fe against Colonization</a>. <br/></p>
<p>It will be a journey where I will encourage the sharing of stories of 'home' by locals and those who visit SFAI. They will also have a chance to be a part of the project by making personalized 'Home Dolls' that will then be incorporated into my video and installations. <br/><br/>Along this journey I will face the loss of my own home after the passing of my mother last December. In my travels through the desert there will be a series of constructed rituals that will incorporate the releasing of my Mother's ashes. I hope to find a peace and allow her to find rest in these lands. </p>
</div> <div> <p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES<br/>
</h3>
<p>[1] Time-frame (4 weeks)
<br/>[2] Unfamiliarity w/ location
<br/>[3] Finding &amp; scheduling performers<br/>[4] Pre-scouting 
before shoot<br/>[5] Shooting in the desert<br/>[6] Finalizing first cut of video<br/></p>
<br/>
<p>HOW I WILL FACE THESE CHALLENGES: </p>
<p>[1]
<br/>I will set a detailed production schedule leaving room for changes but it will create a base to begin the project on and keep the work on track. <a href=""http://laniasuncionblog.com/category/artist-residency/page/2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p>[2 &amp; 3] 
<br/>I have not worked at this location in the past which means I will 
have to solidify talent commitments and collaborators once I arrive in 
July. I have begun 
researching and contacting local performing who have already shown interest in being involved in the project. <br/></p>
<p>[4]
<br/>Scouting plays a major roll in my work and being able to spend a 
significant amount of time within a location enables me to better work 
in the space. Once I arrive I will begin scouting for areas to shoot, this could take a number of days to route. <br/></p>
<p>[5]
<br/>Plan to bring lots of WATER! I will also test the camera's sensor limit in different hot environments, and take break times into account.  
<br/></p>
<p>[6]
<br/>If all goes as planned I should be able to create a rough first-cut by the end of the SFAI residency, and continue to refine it at OUTPOST: Cuts and Burns AiR. If any delays in production arise I will send out a update right away.<br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>OTHER WAYS TO HELP<br/>
</h3>No worries if you are unable to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help: <ul> <li>Call out to all the awesome people you know! It would be extremely helpful if you could assist in getting the word out and make some noise about this campaign and help make connections with possibly interested supporters.  <br/>
</li> <li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools. It is super easy with one click and 'poof' the interconnections begin. <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <p></p><h1>
<b><br/>THANK YOU!!!</b>
</h1><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to check out this campaign page! Much warm thanks for 
supporting my upcoming project. It always amazes me how things come 
together and every little part helps in the making. <br/></p><br/></div>","Santa Fe Art Institute Artists Residency in July



The beginning of this year started fierce with major intense
change that shifted everything. But now I will gather myself and
move forward to the possibilities of the future and growth. From July 1-26, 2015 I have been granted an artist residency at Santa Fe Art Institute, I need your support to assist in this journey.
Santa Fe Art Institute



At this residency I will not only produce a new work
but it will be a personal journey that will lead me to make art within a land I
have yet to explore. Joining me will be local histories, Native American stories of the Southwest, and
my Mother who I ask to lead and guide me.

I have begun testing materials to hold the 'objects of home' that I will carry upon my back while performing in NM. I have decided to use outdoor safety & utility rope for these forms. **  They come in a variety of colors and I am excited to begin mixing and testing which ones work best for the project.  **NOTE: There is a perk that offers the chance to get one of these smaller forms containing a special surprise nested inside. 

SCULPTURAL OBJECTS 

Special thanks to Emcee C.M., Master of None for assistance in construction.Currently in production is a few object pieces I'll be using in my project. One is a four sided triangle form that opens up to become a compass with a graphic element, activate by a bell like form. It will help guild the nomadic characters as they move along the New Mexico landscape. Also, I am working on a modular construction made of units that can hold small objects that will be carried like a backpack, easily to put together and take apart like a tent. I aim to construct the pieces for this form here to assemble while at SFAI and add to if needed. 

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

I will invite the public who come to visit my studio at SFAI to
make dolls-like forms in concept of home. I am curious why one chooses these forms and what each means to them. What aspects of home gives one power and identity. 
I will then take these forms with the ones
I have produced and bring them along with me to the desert using them in
constructed performance rituals. 


The forms I will be researching are Kachina dolls made by
Pueblo tribes of the Southwest. These dolls are considered to be Spirit
beings; they
can represent anything in the natural world or cosmos, from a revered ancestor
to an element, a location, a quality, a natural phenomenon, or a concept.
I want to connect the idea that home can be more then just a room with four walls or a structure containing belongings. What symbols and ideas of home hold power for us, if so why? 



   PROJECT NEED

The support you give will help cover the following:
Residency Fee = $900

Travel = $875


Flight from to NYC to Albuquerque, New Mexico
$350

Train to Santa Fe $30

I will also need a rental car to get around from
one shoot location to the other. Some locations are 1-3 hrs away from SFAI $165
week x 3 weeks= $ 495


Lodging = $300      Overnight stays at camping grounds and Airbnb rentals along travel routs.
Local Artist Hire = $200 +I am in the process of having an
earth wear piece produced by a local New Mexican artist in Santa Fe made of terracotta mixed from local earth to be used in the constructed performance rituals. This will not only give
me a chance to collaborate with a local artist but also help me support their
art practice. I will also be looking for performers to hire & volunteer for the project. Total Funding Need: $ 2,275

PROJECT SIGNIFICANCE 
 This project will bring a contemporary spotlight to the history of the first 
independent attempt by the Pueblo tribes of Santa Fe against Colonization. 
It will be a journey where I will encourage the sharing of stories of 'home' by locals and those who visit SFAI. They will also have a chance to be a part of the project by making personalized 'Home Dolls' that will then be incorporated into my video and installations. Along this journey I will face the loss of my own home after the passing of my mother last December. In my travels through the desert there will be a series of constructed rituals that will incorporate the releasing of my Mother's ashes. I hope to find a peace and allow her to find rest in these lands. 
  

RISKS & CHALLENGES

[1] Time-frame (4 weeks)
[2] Unfamiliarity w/ location
[3] Finding & scheduling performers[4] Pre-scouting 
before shoot[5] Shooting in the desert[6] Finalizing first cut of video

HOW I WILL FACE THESE CHALLENGES: 
[1]
I will set a detailed production schedule leaving room for changes but it will create a base to begin the project on and keep the work on track. 
[2 & 3] 
I have not worked at this location in the past which means I will 
have to solidify talent commitments and collaborators once I arrive in 
July. I have begun 
researching and contacting local performing who have already shown interest in being involved in the project. 
[4]
Scouting plays a major roll in my work and being able to spend a 
significant amount of time within a location enables me to better work 
in the space. Once I arrive I will begin scouting for areas to shoot, this could take a number of days to route. 
[5]
Plan to bring lots of WATER! I will also test the camera's sensor limit in different hot environments, and take break times into account.  

[6]
If all goes as planned I should be able to create a rough first-cut by the end of the SFAI residency, and continue to refine it at OUTPOST: Cuts and Burns AiR. If any delays in production arise I will send out a update right away.   OTHER WAYS TO HELP

<p>Following the massacre of innocents at the Army Public
School in Peshawar, a significant change has happened in state policy in
Pakistan such that decades of state’s sponsorship of extremism has given way to
squeezing of extremist forces and apologist voices. For the first time since
1978, the state seems to allow equal space to peace loving forces to propagate
their message. Additionally, Peshawar has also created an impact on the society's psyche making citizens more open to peace messages. However, progressive forces are weak and disorganized and their
message marginal, while the masses barely manage acute inequality in life
opportunities because of dysfunctional state’s failure to provide the
necessities of health and education. Thus, the necessary germs for progressive
formations in society which include both discourse and organization are
missing. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What is Needed:</b></p>
<p>We need to grab the current opportunity and capture our lost public space. In terms of discourse, a society where violence has become a norm, real
change requires a deeper understanding of why we accept violence in the name of
religion while building an alternative liberation discourse for people to reclaim
their public space, public discourse and religion. While peace activists have kept
the flame burning during our dark decades, it’s now time to involve wider sections of society through innovative ways in
reclaiming our identity of peaceful coexistence and celebration of diversity. In
organizational perspective, the single important principle for building active
citizenship is contribution in terms of time or funds. Thus, volunteerism and crowdfunding
make a good combination for an anti-extremism initiative to be owned by the
citizens in every respect. </p>

We've had a very successful first year for the Whitby Community Murals Project. The artists have done a remarkable job on their murals across Whitby and Brooklin. While we have had generous support from sponsors, we still need to raise an additional $1500. This will assist with meeting this years budget and provide seed funding for 2016. 
The
Whitby Community Murals Project 2015, an innovative collaboration between
businesses, community organizations, local artists, and local government to
benefit the citizens of and visitors to our community. A project team of local
volunteers has been organized and the lead partners are Station Gallery and the
Bell Box Murals Program.  The event is
scheduled for Cultural Days September 25 & 26 2015.
The Murals Project is a curated project
that promotes original works of art – replacing graffiti. It is a public art
forum designed to reflect culture and heritage, enhance a sense of community,
and promote local artists.
   What We Need & What You Get 

In order to make this exciting initiative a reality, we are seeking sponsorship support and donations. Our revenue goal is $12,000. The entire budget depends on generous private support from our community. 
In our inaugural year, we will be painting eight murals across Whitby.  We are seeking support from the community to support us with a donation of any size to help us achieve our goal.

Tonight, as Dad and I shared a quiet dinner in his room to get away from the bustle and crowded places, I felt a soft breeze move through. Dad suddenly opened his eyes from that dreamy distant place and asked, ""Did you feel that?""
""Yes, I did.""He and I have been spending the whole day alone on Sunday to give Dee Dee a much deserved timeless day of recharge. Dad spent much of the day traveling between worlds, me holding his hands and holding his heart with my prayers.I could feel the quality of the other side, wherever we come from when we're born and return to when we die. I could feel it shimmering in all my cells. It's beautiful.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, we're Sally and Tom - the creators of Fair Stock. </p>
<p>We hope you liked our Indiegogo campaign video, and are keen to jump on board and get involved. Here's a bit more information about our goal.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What Is Fair Stock?</h3>
<div>Fair-Stock.com is a stock photography website with a huge difference. As it stands, we have not found a single stock imagery website that offers it's contributors any more than 50% commission. The reality is, most offer much, much less - with some offering as little as 0.5% commission. We had to stop and ask ourselves, for what? Sure, they offer a platform to sell on but the main work and creativity is done by the artist. We felt this needed to change. We saw a need for a stock imagery website with the majority of commissions going to the artist. So, we created Fair-Stock.com. Fair Stock offers contributors a game changing 90% commission, with the remaining 10% going to maintaining, marketing, promoting and improving the site/experience. We're empowering artists, and putting money back in the pockets of those who deserve it most. We've had an overwhelming response so far, but for us to continue our good work, we need your help.</div>
<h3>Why do we need funding?</h3>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We need a developer to help us automate and streamline the website's functions, including removing menial manual tasks we are currently required to actively and repeatedly manage. </li>
<li>We need a developer to also help improve the contributor's uploading experience, by adding a bulk upload feature, and the ability to pickup certain file specs so the contributors don't have to manually add these, also error messages if images that are too small or the wrong file type are uploaded.</li>
<li>We need funding to maintain, market &amp; advertise Fair Stock, which will help us further promote Fair Stock and build traffic to the site, and in turn, increase the sales of our contributor's work.</li>
<li>We also need to increase our hosting. Every website has to be manually hosted somewhere in the world on a physical server. Bigger sites, require bigger servers - and an image based website, like ours, requires very big hosting. This basically will mean the site won't crash every 5 minutes, will be able to hold millions of images, and will give browsers a fast and seamless experience</li>

<div>
<p>La structure
Wakh Art, promeut depuis sa fondation, l’art et la culture sénégalaise. Notre objectif est de faire de la culture un facteur de
développement. L’art au service de la société… </p>
<p><u><b>Nos
Activités:</b></u></p>
<p>À travers le blog culturelle Wakh
art, nous rencontrons des artistes et nous les interviewons.  Avec
eux, nous créons aussi des évènements, expositions, concerts,
représentations, sous le concept de soirée intitulé Wakh art invite.</p>
<p>Wakhart accompagne également les artistes,
sur leurs projets artistiques. Nous avons l’ambition de développer et de mettre
en place notamment des ateliers d’éveilles et d’initiations à l’art; en
partenariat avec différentes écoles nationales. </p>
<p>Nous avons
également créer un pole culturelle
ouvert au public où la culture est
à la porté de la population sénégalaise:
La Boite à Idée.</p>
<p><u><b>Notre mission:</b></u></p>
<p>Nous
voulons faire de Wakh ‘Art, la plateforme culturelle, un prisme duquel émanera
l’ensemble de la culture sénégalaise. Nous sommes convaincus qu’il est
important de mettre en lumière les talents et les créations des artistes et
artisans de la scène culturelle sénégalaise. Nous croyons en la richesse
culturelle que nous possédons ici au Sénégal. Nous sommes certains que grâce à
ces industries culturelles naissantes et solides, le Sénégal arrivera à un
niveau de développement important et  ainsi la jeunesse sénégalaise pourra
prétendre à un avenir stable et plein de promesse.</p>
<p><b>La Boite à Idée:</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>La
Boite à Idée est une
maison nichée au cœur de la Gueule Tapée. </p>
<p>C’est
un espace coloré et dynamique ouvert au
public. (en générale sur rdv ou durant une période déterminé).</p>
<p>La
Boite à Idée est une projection physique de Wakh’Art. La maison a abrité nombreux
shootings, quelques expositions et tournages.
C’est également dans ce lieu que les interviews pour la plateforme culturelle
Wakh’Art sont faites. </p>
<p>Le
public peut découvrir au sein de ces murs, les œuvres des plasticiens avec
lesquels nous avons collaboré , mais aussi une bibliothèque contenant Romans,
Catalogues, journaux, prospectus etc. Cet espace
propose un cadre chaleureux au le
public ainsi qu’aux artistes et acteurs culturels. Souvent ils se retrouvent
pour échanger et partager leurs idées. </p>
<p>La
maison a ainsi vu naître de nombreux projets. Elle a aussi accueillit
projection de film, débat, showcase etc. </p>

La structure
Wakh Art, promeut depuis sa fondation, l’art et la culture sénégalaise. Notre objectif est de faire de la culture un facteur de
développement. L’art au service de la société… 
Nos
Activités:
À travers le blog culturelle Wakh
art, nous rencontrons des artistes et nous les interviewons.  Avec
eux, nous créons aussi des évènements, expositions, concerts,
représentations, sous le concept de soirée intitulé Wakh art invite.
Wakhart accompagne également les artistes,
sur leurs projets artistiques. Nous avons l’ambition de développer et de mettre
en place notamment des ateliers d’éveilles et d’initiations à l’art; en
partenariat avec différentes écoles nationales. 
Nous avons
également créer un pole culturelle
ouvert au public où la culture est
à la porté de la population sénégalaise:
La Boite à Idée.
Notre mission:
Nous
voulons faire de Wakh ‘Art, la plateforme culturelle, un prisme duquel émanera
l’ensemble de la culture sénégalaise. Nous sommes convaincus qu’il est
important de mettre en lumière les talents et les créations des artistes et
artisans de la scène culturelle sénégalaise. Nous croyons en la richesse
culturelle que nous possédons ici au Sénégal. Nous sommes certains que grâce à
ces industries culturelles naissantes et solides, le Sénégal arrivera à un
niveau de développement important et  ainsi la jeunesse sénégalaise pourra
prétendre à un avenir stable et plein de promesse.
La Boite à Idée:

La
Boite à Idée est une
maison nichée au cœur de la Gueule Tapée. 
C’est
un espace coloré et dynamique ouvert au
public. (en générale sur rdv ou durant une période déterminé).
La
Boite à Idée est une projection physique de Wakh’Art. La maison a abrité nombreux
shootings, quelques expositions et tournages.
C’est également dans ce lieu que les interviews pour la plateforme culturelle
Wakh’Art sont faites. 
Le
public peut découvrir au sein de ces murs, les œuvres des plasticiens avec
lesquels nous avons collaboré , mais aussi une bibliothèque contenant Romans,
Catalogues, journaux, prospectus etc. Cet espace
propose un cadre chaleureux au le
public ainsi qu’aux artistes et acteurs culturels. Souvent ils se retrouvent
pour échanger et partager leurs idées. 
La
maison a ainsi vu naître de nombreux projets. Elle a aussi accueillit
projection de film, débat, showcase etc.

<h3>Artist as Art</h3>
<p>Art always looks good. In 2021, it will never look better. After a challenging 2020, we’re unwrapping a shiny new show: Clique21, bringing together 21 of southern New Jersey’s most talented and provocative artists and photographers.</p>
<h3>By and for South Jersey</h3>
<p>It was created by and for the southern New Jersey arts community. Together, the artists and photographers live and work in all eight counties of southern New Jersey; Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Ocean and Salem.</p>
<p><br/>As with the 2016 debut event, Clique21 aims to shine a spotlight on the creative force that drives the arts in South Jersey, the artists. The show will provide both superb documentary photos to the artists and striking portfolio opportunities to the photographers. </p>
<p><br/>A production of ArtC and Strobe NJ, with support from Gallery 50, Inc., Clique21 continues the tradition, with 21 of the region’s most celebrated photographers and artists in a 2021 show. Five photographers will create portraits of 16 visual and performing artists.</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>The show will cost approximately $15,785, to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photography fees</li>
<li>Artists’ stipends</li>
<li>Professional framing with conservatory glass </li>
<li>Archival photo printing  </li>
<li>Promotion and marketing</li>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>Opening receptions</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Clique21 will nourish the local economy. ArtC and Gallery 50, Inc will contract exclusively with local printers, framers, caterers and other professionals to produce and promote the show. More importantly, as with the 2016 premiere event, it will boost morale and pride in the South Jersey art community.</p>
<p><br/>If we raise more than the $15,000, the surplus will be used to create a fund to help South Jersey artists ready their art for exhibition, with framing and other preparation required to meet professional gallery standards. </p>
<h3>Please share!</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign to your friends and social networks—and thank you for your continued support of the arts in southern New Jersey.</p>

<h3>Pan Genius</h3>
<p>Picture yourself trodding along in a dust storm in the desert. Nothing can been seen through the thick playa dust that's whirling around your head. As you walk a little further you hear the creak and groan of metal scraping against metal and the grinding of gears. The dust clears and before you sits a towering robotic chimp. He's crashing together cymbals and screeching in maniacal delight. You've found Pan Genius and he's waiting for you to crank him up for another round of raucous monkey mischief!</p>
<p>My name is Amy Munson and I am the Lead Artist/Designer bringing Pan Genius to Burning Man 2018. I have always had a keen interest in machinery and robotics and I hope to bring a ton of fun to the playa with this, my flagship project. I've got a crack team working on engineering and logistics and with your help, we can make Pan Genius a reality this Burning Man 2018!</p>
<h3><strong>What Is Pan Genius?</strong></h3>
<p>Pan Genius is a giant robotic cymbal playing chimp propped on top of Darwin’s book “On the Origin of Species"". The metal frame, gears and inner workings will be visible through a protective clear fiberglass shell that will compose the face and body. The moving arms will clash together cymbals, complete with a mighty monkey screech during one revolution of it’s cycle. His intense eyes will appear to move as the head nods with the motion of the arms. The movement will be powered by a hand-wheel located on the side of the piece, along with the efforts of one-two participants that will bring him to life.</p>
<p>Pan Genius is intended to be amusing, if not a little scary. In either case we want our audience to feel excited when they encounter something as unexpected as this robotic chimp sitting on the playa. And we hope that with your help and contributions, we can make him a reality.</p>
<h3>The Mechanics</h3>
<p>Via the accompanying wheel mechanism, a participant can power the movement of the chimp by hand cranking the wheel located on the side of the piece which will run through a full cycle of movement consisting of the arms widening and head rearing back, propelling a forward motion of the chimp’s head and arms, crashing together the accompanying cymbals contained within the hands. The crashing together of the cymbals will also initiate the cam that contains the screech box (acoustic amplifier) which will let out a delightful monkey scream.</p>
<h3>Night Time</h3>
<p>Filled with an eerie blue glow, Pan Genius will be beaming with high-powered led stripping that will ignite his robotic monkey body from within. His laser-like eyes will glow an alarming red, hypnotizing you with his gaze. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523816904/wicfoq8rhkjbcd4ei8iu.png"" src=""""/></p>

<li>Fundraising gifts, taxes, and fees</li>

<p>Your donations will go towards the operation, transportation, and fabrication costs of creating Pan Genius.  We have already received a generous Burning Man Honorarium Grant that covers a portion of the project, however, your money will help fund the purchase of the necessary metal and parts that this clangy monkey will require, as well as the lovely clear resin shells, fiberglass, painted platform, and transportation to the playa.</p>
<p>In return we are excited to offer our supporters some unique Pan Genius swag!  Our most unique gifts include having your name handwritten on the spine of the book (platform that the monkey sits on), as well as handmade pendants by artist Vulfie Munson created specifically for this campaign.  </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Pan Genius is the largest project this crew has ever created. One of the biggest challenge is engineering the internal mechanisms and fabricating the fiberglass and resin parts. In addition to all of this we need to make sure the monkey is anchored well and structurally sound for safety.  We have the professional expertise of Chief Engineer Vulfie Munson who has the knowledge and expertise in constructing structurally sound pieces. Having had a few art installations of his own on the playa, he is well versed in overcoming the hurdles creating playa art can pose.</p>

sin dal 1996. Dal 2008 ha
generato una rete Internazionale di interscambio: MED'ARTE
che sostiene artisti contemporanei provenienti da tutto il mondo, con

BREVE DESCRIZIONE DELLA CAMPAGNA
RACCOLTA FONDI E PERCHE è IMPORTANTE PERSEGUIRLALa campagna
raccolta fondi rappresenta un’azione mirata in cui l'incentivo alla promozione
del nostro grande patrimonio culturale, diventa la strategia che nel corso
degli anni può trasformare il territorio in un grande palcoscenico in cui l’arte
contemporanea diventa un progetto interdisciplinare di ARTI PERFORMATIVE che
coinvolge artisti coreografi danzatori 
provenienti da tutto il mondo.

IL
PROGETTOLo scopo
di questo progetto è sostenere la ricerca attraverso l'individuazione di

prendere coscienza dell'ambiente urbano e a favorire lo scambio e la

L’approccio antropologico, fa sì che gli
artisti attraverso un programma condiviso, possano rendere visibile il loro
percorso artistico che così “rivive” in un contesto di comparazione e dialogo
intergenerazionale.





Per noi è importante:


sostenere la creatività soprattutto dei  giovani artisti indipendenti;

incentivare la mobilità e la circuitazione di compagnie e coreografi
attivi sul territorio regionale nazionale/internazionale ed extra europeo.

I started with creating experimental/abstract music during 1998. Later in 2010 I released my music to the net. Then I noticed that it was very hard to share your music with a group of people who enjoy what you create. The niche audience, those who create experimental music, electronic, avant-garde, synthpop, etc. So I formed #WEATNU in Aug of 2014.</p><p><a href=""http://twitter.com/weatnu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#WEATNU</a> is a collective effort to help the indie underground artist. We give them the power to be heard, and promote their music through our 3 forms of promotion, including  <a href=""http://twitter.com/our"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://twitter.com/weatnu_our"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">net-radio</a>, <a href=""https://weatnu.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">label</a> and <a href=""http://weatnu-magazine.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online magazine</a>. </p><p>#WEATNU is bridging the gap for the indie electronic artist to find their audience, and of course the fans are finding their artists. #WEATNU is changing things for the better. We are creating a real impact on the web, and this of course is all <b>free.</b></p><p>But we need help financially per month, using indiegogo will help us overcome any loss of donations that we already have going via paypal. Your donations will help fund this great effort + movement to help the underground artist. It will help pay for server fees, maintenance and new features that we hope to implement in time. </p><h2>We continue to grow.</h2><p>Since 2014 we have been creating waves on the Internet and building up steam slowly, many artists come to us who want a little extra presence. Thanks to an entire year of pushing WEATNU we are now where we are. The artists that come to us are from all parts of the world. Electronic music outside the realm of the mainstream is eclectic in nature, but these artists need fans, they need people to appreciate them. Without WEATNU they would not have found new listeners.</p><h2>We also support Underground dance.</h2><p>Thanks to the success of one of our radio portals, <a href=""https://twitter.com/weatnu_echo6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EchoStation</a>, we have found artists who are creating amazing house, deephouse, techno, and many other styles outside the mainstream. Some of these artists are with us through WEATNU Records such as <a href=""https://twitter.com/_Sek70R_"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sek70R</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/jazzykat7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jazzykat</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/minutes_after"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Minutes After</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/UnclesOfWise"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Uncles of Wise</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/analogmusiq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WSM</a> to name a few.</p><p><br/></p><h2><b>#WEATNU wants to do more in 2016.</b></h2><p>WEATNU Records: our online label has been selling digital music since Dec 2014. We want to begin offering CD's and Vinyl to our fans.  It takes a good deal of money to do this. WEATNU wants to grow and without funds, we cannot move forward. If you can give <b>10</b> - <b>20</b> dollars or more the rewards are. </p><p></p><ul>
<li>Free music, MP3s and special collection albums on digital and CD or special releases on vinyl, USB, etc.</li>
<li>Special edition copies.</li>
<li>Lower prices on T-shirts and merchandise through <a href=""https://weatnu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">weatnu.com.</a><br/>[Having the funds to purchase in bulk allows us to offer t-shirts for a lesser price.]</li>
</ul><div>A donation of <b>5</b> to<b> 10 </b>dollars or more from those who really want to see this effort stay alive is all it takes. Remember, you are helping the indie artist in a collective manner. Our movement is helping the hidden scene of great electronic musicians be heard. <a href=""https://twitter.com/weatnu/lists/weatnu/members"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We have helped well over 400 artists since the beginning. </a>Not to mention over 80 on our label <a href=""https://weatnu.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WEATNU RECORDS</a>.<p></p>
<p>Are you an electronic musician yourself, and having trouble finding your niche audience? Then we help people like yourself.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our goal</h3>
<div>To change how people receive electronic music and provide a career for the independent artist through self-promo and auto-promotion, including web presence. While the music industry takes in mainstream styles, we mirror this and take in underground styles, thus creating our very own virtual music community, but simply we are a massive movement of change world-wide. There is nothing else like #WEATNU. Also since 2014 WEATNU would like to be more well known, so it can serve future styles of Electronic music, and the artists themselves. A staple of the Internet for indie artists to rely on, always for free. <p></p>

<p>We are the New Underground is the wave of the future, we are all one!</p>
</div>
</div><br/></div>","#WEATNU is ""We are the New Underground.""Hello, my name is Almark, I'm an electronic musician. I started with creating experimental/abstract music during 1998. Later in 2010 I released my music to the net. Then I noticed that it was very hard to share your music with a group of people who enjoy what you create. The niche audience, those who create experimental music, electronic, avant-garde, synthpop, etc. So I formed #WEATNU in Aug of 2014.#WEATNU is a collective effort to help the indie underground artist. We give them the power to be heard, and promote their music through our 3 forms of promotion, including  net-radio, label and online magazine. #WEATNU is bridging the gap for the indie electronic artist to find their audience, and of course the fans are finding their artists. #WEATNU is changing things for the better. We are creating a real impact on the web, and this of course is all free.But we need help financially per month, using indiegogo will help us overcome any loss of donations that we already have going via paypal. Your donations will help fund this great effort + movement to help the underground artist. It will help pay for server fees, maintenance and new features that we hope to implement in time. We continue to grow.Since 2014 we have been creating waves on the Internet and building up steam slowly, many artists come to us who want a little extra presence. Thanks to an entire year of pushing WEATNU we are now where we are. The artists that come to us are from all parts of the world. Electronic music outside the realm of the mainstream is eclectic in nature, but these artists need fans, they need people to appreciate them. Without WEATNU they would not have found new listeners.We also support Underground dance.Thanks to the success of one of our radio portals, EchoStation, we have found artists who are creating amazing house, deephouse, techno, and many other styles outside the mainstream. Some of these artists are with us through WEATNU Records such as Sek70R, Jazzykat, Minutes After, Uncles of Wise, WSM to name a few.#WEATNU wants to do more in 2016.WEATNU Records: our online label has been selling digital music since Dec 2014. We want to begin offering CD's and Vinyl to our fans.  It takes a good deal of money to do this. WEATNU wants to grow and without funds, we cannot move forward. If you can give 10 - 20 dollars or more the rewards are. 
Free music, MP3s and special collection albums on digital and CD or special releases on vinyl, USB, etc.
Special edition copies.
Lower prices on T-shirts and merchandise through weatnu.com.[Having the funds to purchase in bulk allows us to offer t-shirts for a lesser price.]
A donation of 5 to 10 dollars or more from those who really want to see this effort stay alive is all it takes. Remember, you are helping the indie artist in a collective manner. Our movement is helping the hidden scene of great electronic musicians be heard. We have helped well over 400 artists since the beginning. Not to mention over 80 on our label WEATNU RECORDS.
Are you an electronic musician yourself, and having trouble finding your niche audience? Then we help people like yourself.

Our goal
To change how people receive electronic music and provide a career for the independent artist through self-promo and auto-promotion, including web presence. While the music industry takes in mainstream styles, we mirror this and take in underground styles, thus creating our very own virtual music community, but simply we are a massive movement of change world-wide. There is nothing else like #WEATNU. Also since 2014 WEATNU would like to be more well known, so it can serve future styles of Electronic music, and the artists themselves. A staple of the Internet for indie artists to rely on, always for free.

<p>Drift has evolved from a core group of artists and builders who have been realizing Big Dreams for decades through festivals such as Burning Man and Symbiosis. We build large-scale, interactive pieces that mimic the style of nature. Clean lines and symmetric design are thrown out the window and out emerges a timeless space where rough-hewn abandoned shacks emerge from the heart of a tree, and dilapidated lighthouses lean gently toward the ground.  Seaweed lanterns, driftwood sculptures and mossy paths entice the likes of Sirens while interactive features such as waterslides, swings and water cannons bring out the eternal youth of the lost boys of Neverland. While we do what we can to gather from nature, we still need funds to buy lumber, slides and decorative material. Without your support, we can not realize our dream to build this magical wonderland.</p>

<p>Evolve Studio is a dynamic, multi-use space in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles.  We believe that art can be creatively expressed in many ways, through multiple mediums including photography, painting, sculpture, film, music, dance, even 3D VR technology, so we created a special space where we can showcase the talents of emerging and well-established artists and help them to develop and present new ideas and exhibitions.</p>
<p>Evolve Studio is also a gathering space for live events, learning, and social experiences. In addition, to monthly art openings, we’ll present classes in photography, filmmaking, painting, sculpture, and dance. In addition, we plan to create partnerships with local non-profit organizations to raise awareness and provide education on social issues such as HIV, AIDS, homelessness and poverty.</p>

<p>Louis “Kengi” Carr is a proud Los Angeles native, born and raised in beautiful Santa Monica. As professional freelance photographer and Getty Images contributor, Kengi enjoys three realms of photography: editorial, event, and street. Just to toss things up a bit, he's also the founder of Project KengiKat | Do Something Saturday, a grass roots, community-based organization serving homeless individuals, low-income families, children, seniors as well as individuals living with HIV or AIDS. He is the author of four books of photography, currently working on his fifth. Evolve Gallery is his creation, his vision and his passion for art and photography combined with his passion for humanity come to life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Evolve Gallery was originally created and curated in 2014  to raise awareness for HIV and AIDS here in Los Angeles. With over 35 artists, photographers and ceramicists participating in what was supposed to be a 3-day pop-up show ended up being a nearly 3-month event complete with a red carpet opening night reception with over 500 people in attendance. </p>

<p>Although he enjoys the privileges of capturing many celebrity red carpet events including the Pan African Film Festival, Style and Fashion Week Los Angeles, he prefers the grit of street photography and photojournalism where his images have been called “haunting” and “brilliant” </p>
<p>This formerly homeless, HIV positive advocate/activist has over 15 years of curating art, photography and live events, Kengi loves providing space and working with emerging as well as established artists and photographers creating galleries and exhibits that raise awareness for HIV and AIDS, homelessness, and poverty.</p>

By pre ordering the products in advance you are also helping me fund and create the products you are ordering (I know, mind blowing!).-Lawrence Lindell is an artist and musician from Los Angeles, CA. -He graduated from Otis College of Art and Design in 2011 with a BFA in Digital Media/Illustration.-In 2009, Lindell started his music career as Kid Law and in 2013 decided to start using his real name for both his art and music. - His music and art career has been 100% independent since 2009. -Solo Art Exhibitions

Why its important.By setting up my own studio it allows me to be in a position where I will never have to compromise my art to make money nor go against my morals and values. By owning my own studio I can continue to push a positive light that is so desperately needed in this world and also empower my own people and others on a larger scale.My studio will be 100% black own, which might not mean a lot to you if you're not black, but in our communities we don't own a lot of anything and as I get older I see how important it is that we have our own outlets that allows us to get our voices heard with out outside forces that could care less rather we live or die.My studio will be 100% artist owned, which might not mean much if you're not an artist, but in the artist community we don't own a lot of anything either. We are always taught to work for others and never really understand how valuable and important our work actually is. We as artist need to invest in ourselves and each other so we can't be silenced nor pushed out. It's a gross pattern I see where people let artist build and create a magical environment, then take it away for their own selfish and money driven agenda. When we own our own, it's harder for them to do so.
What will your investment manifest into?Products- When you pre order your ""perk"" you will be funding the printing and production cost necessary to bring this vision to life.

Period. WE NEED YOUR HELP!We are moving!!We are finally making the move from our cramped 2nd floor gallery space to a ground floor storefront, but we need a little help along the way. At every art show we have artists asking about joining our collective and the only reason we turn anyone away is lack of space, We want to relocated to a bigger space that will accommodate more artists and will give us more room to host our unique art shows and provide weekly demos and classes. A storefront location would also allow us to maintain regular gallery hours.We are looking to raise $5000 to help with the costs of moving and renovating the new art space. In exchange for your generous donations, we have some amazing perks donated by our gallery members.

Thanks to so many amazing backers, I gain time and creative freedom to explore new ideas between campaigns. And in full circle, the things I learn and pieces I make during these explorations come right back to the following Indiegogo projects.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523293283/y0qznna8zfvyectdvsa8.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Visit our website at <a href=""http://www.davidwalshbowlmaker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.davidwalshbowlmaker.com</a> to find more of my work and learn about the various woods I turn.</i></p><p>--------------------</p><p>--------------------</p><h3>Finish Types:</h3><p>The bowls offered in this campaign are either part of my Gallery series (G+ or G++) or Rustic series (R).</p><p>Sometimes I will turn a bowl to what I consider a ""<strong>Tool finish</strong>"". This means that the surface of the bowl retains the marks of the carving tools left by the maker. Depending on the maker's skill, tool marks can be either crude or refined. Before the use of sandpaper, every handmade wooden object had a tool finish, which directly reflects the hand and artistry of the maker. Most old antiques have tool finishes, increasing their value to collectors. My tool finish bowls may be given a light sanding of one or two grits of sandpaper, making the surface smoother and more uniform, while still leaving the tool marks visible. One application of a specially blended food-safe finish is applied, and then the bowl is buffed to give it a little shine.</p><p>Like tool finish bowls, ""<strong>Rustic finish</strong>"" bowls may retain some tool marks but will be smoother to the touch because they go through a more in-depth sanding with multiple grits of sandpaper. One application of blended finish is applied, and then the bowl is buffed to give it a little shine.</p><p>""<strong>Gallery (G+) finish</strong>"" is of the highest quality in sanding and polish. The wood is sanded through a series of up to 12 different grades of sandpaper until it is smooth as silk to the touch. G+ finished bowls go through multiple applications of blended finish before returning to the lathe for a 2-step buffing process. These extra steps allows the finish to achieve a high-gloss shine, showcasing the wood it protects.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523293489/jcyttdn9ur3kzvqsete7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Finish Types Shown On A Variety of Bowls</i></p><p>--------------------</p><p>--------------------</p><h3>A few things you might wonder about in advance... </h3><p>Throughout the project, you may come across words you don't know in relation to the pieces. Here are a few recurring ones and what they mean:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>SPALTED/SPALTING</strong> is any color (such as the black lines) that appear as a tree gets older or the decay from resting on the ground for a time. Spalting can be very convoluted and the patterns can resemble a map or sometimes a fantasy or animal figure. They may have some surface pecks as the hardness of the wood varies within the bowl.</li>
<li>A <strong>BURL</strong> is an abnormal growth on the outside trunk of a tree. Burls are quite rare as they do not grow on every tree. They form when the cells that make up new bud growth begin to deviate, dividing in many different directions and form a large bump instead of a branch or root. The grain now spirals, twists and knots (as opposed to normal growth, which results in straight and predictable grain) and now has intricate grain patterns and vivid colors that make it a world-class wood. These irregularities, however, make the burl one of the trickiest woods to turn but also one of the most beautiful.</li>
<li>
<strong>HOLLOW FORMS</strong> are made with special tools and techniques to remove 90% of the wood inside the vase, which allows it to dry properly. I call them vases but please note that they are not to be used with water!</li>

Quebracho G+ Hollow Vase 13789 (4”w by 3.75”h)</h3><p>Quebracho is a rare Argentinian evergreen, which actually translates to ""axe breaker"". One of the hardest woods in the world, quebracho heartwood color is a range of reds that can also have black streaks. It can be difficult to find as an imported wood, which can cause prices to be high. Quebracho was also once heavily exploited in the late 1800s, and certain species are still on the Red list for their vulnerability in decline. The exploitation was for its use in leather tanning. The heartwood contains a high concentration of tannins, which can be extracted when it is cut into small pieces and used to dye leather.</p><p><i>This particular piece actually comes from a set of antique bocce balls, circa late 1800s, early 1900s and made in Scotland or England. However, they were being called lignum vitae.The reason for this is quite interesting! First, both types of woods were being imported into the United Kingdom at this time.

Thanks to so many amazing backers, I gain time and creative freedom to explore new ideas between campaigns. And in full circle, the things I learn and pieces I make during these explorations come right back to the following Indiegogo projects. Visit our website at www.davidwalshbowlmaker.com to find more of my work and learn about the various woods I turn.----------------------------------------Finish Types:The bowls offered in this campaign are either part of my Gallery series (G+ or G++) or Rustic series (R).Sometimes I will turn a bowl to what I consider a ""Tool finish"". This means that the surface of the bowl retains the marks of the carving tools left by the maker. Depending on the maker's skill, tool marks can be either crude or refined. Before the use of sandpaper, every handmade wooden object had a tool finish, which directly reflects the hand and artistry of the maker. Most old antiques have tool finishes, increasing their value to collectors. My tool finish bowls may be given a light sanding of one or two grits of sandpaper, making the surface smoother and more uniform, while still leaving the tool marks visible. One application of a specially blended food-safe finish is applied, and then the bowl is buffed to give it a little shine.Like tool finish bowls, ""Rustic finish"" bowls may retain some tool marks but will be smoother to the touch because they go through a more in-depth sanding with multiple grits of sandpaper. One application of blended finish is applied, and then the bowl is buffed to give it a little shine.""Gallery (G+) finish"" is of the highest quality in sanding and polish. The wood is sanded through a series of up to 12 different grades of sandpaper until it is smooth as silk to the touch. G+ finished bowls go through multiple applications of blended finish before returning to the lathe for a 2-step buffing process. These extra steps allows the finish to achieve a high-gloss shine, showcasing the wood it protects.Finish Types Shown On A Variety of Bowls----------------------------------------A few things you might wonder about in advance... Throughout the project, you may come across words you don't know in relation to the pieces. Here are a few recurring ones and what they mean: 

SPALTED/SPALTING is any color (such as the black lines) that appear as a tree gets older or the decay from resting on the ground for a time. Spalting can be very convoluted and the patterns can resemble a map or sometimes a fantasy or animal figure. They may have some surface pecks as the hardness of the wood varies within the bowl.
A BURL is an abnormal growth on the outside trunk of a tree. Burls are quite rare as they do not grow on every tree. They form when the cells that make up new bud growth begin to deviate, dividing in many different directions and form a large bump instead of a branch or root. The grain now spirals, twists and knots (as opposed to normal growth, which results in straight and predictable grain) and now has intricate grain patterns and vivid colors that make it a world-class wood. These irregularities, however, make the burl one of the trickiest woods to turn but also one of the most beautiful.

HOLLOW FORMS are made with special tools and techniques to remove 90% of the wood inside the vase, which allows it to dry properly. I call them vases but please note that they are not to be used with water!

One of the hardest woods in the world, quebracho heartwood color is a range of reds that can also have black streaks. It can be difficult to find as an imported wood, which can cause prices to be high. Quebracho was also once heavily exploited in the late 1800s, and certain species are still on the Red list for their vulnerability in decline. The exploitation was for its use in leather tanning. The heartwood contains a high concentration of tannins, which can be extracted when it is cut into small pieces and used to dye leather.This particular piece actually comes from a set of antique bocce balls, circa late 1800s, early 1900s and made in Scotland or England. However, they were being called lignum vitae.The reason for this is quite interesting! First, both types of woods were being imported into the United Kingdom at this time. But while similar to LV in hardness and location, the colors are completely different. So our question became, why the confusion? Our research determination is that during the time these were made, people actually thought they were using LV since both woods were available. Without the scientific knowledge and testing we have today, makers would have used a more crude determination using weight, location, tool wear and tear, etc. To us, this makes sense as to why they thought it LV. ---------------------$235 Pledge Level - Highly Figured Box Elder G+ Hollow Vase 13788 (5.75”w by 5”h) ---------------------$250 Pledge Level - Bigleaf Maple Burl G+ Bowl 13650 (9.5”w by 4.25”h) ---------------------$260 Pledge Level - Juniper G+ Bowl/Wall Platter 13675 (12.75”l by 12.75”w by 1.75”h)   ---------------------$275 Pledge Level - Box Elder G+ Bowl 13700 (10”l by 8.75”w by 8.5”h) ---------------------$275 Pledge Level - Black Walnut G+ Hollow Vase 13733 (9”w by 6.5”h) ---------------------$325 Pledge Level - English Walnut G+ Bowl 13706 (11.75”w by 4.75”h) ---------------------$375 Pledge Level - Arizona Desert Ironwood G+ Bowl 13713 (5.5”w by 4.75”h) ---------------------$400 Pledge Level - Swamp Maple G+ Calabash Bowl 13640 (12”w by 7”h & 6.5” depth) ---------------------$450 Pledge Level - Snakewood G++ Hollow Vase 13674 (4.5”w by 3”h) ---------------------$550 Pledge Level - Buckeye Burl G++ Bowl/Wall Platter 13632 (18”l by 15.25”w by 2”h)",54.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I am an artist based in California’s Central Coast. My passion is to experience the outdoors via surfing, climbing, hiking, and other adventures, and my inspiration comes from moments of connection to my surroundings - the life, the colors, the energy. I translate these moments into paintings that are true to their subjects, yet enhanced with an expression of my personality - using bright colors and flowing lines. As they progress, the paintings evolve with intuitive and intentional brushstrokes. I believe that nature has the ability to teach us many life lessons if we allow it. The oceans, rocks, and trees are symbolic, and the animals we share the world with are much like us. The blank canvas is a tool to share my thoughts and opinions on what is important, what is worth protecting, and what is so magical about a certain moment or place.</p>
<p>For the last 5 years I have been painting professionally and sharing my work at a variety of weekend art festivals throughout the year. Visitors often ask me if I teach, and to be honest I have always been a little afraid to start! But I am committed to growing my career as an artist, enjoy sharing my knowledge &amp; skills, and love to see others unleashing their creativity. So it only fits! I recently moved into a new home with a very spacious extra room that I have turned into my studio, and it is a perfect classroom space!</p>
<p>This campaign is an effort to raise funds to set up my studio for hosting paint parties, classes, and workshops. All I need is some tables, chairs, easels, brushes and some other tools. These expenses add up quickly and unfortunately it is a number I am unable to invest in at the moment. Since I had my baby in November, it has been a challenge to work and save. Hosting classes is an ideal fit to my new life as a stay-at-home-mom/work-from-home artist. I am excited for this new chapter!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Raised funds will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folding 8’ tables: $120</li>
<li>Chairs: $300</li>
<li>Brushes, various sizes and decent quality: $140</li>
<li>Tabletop easels: $240</li>
<li>Paint: $50</li>
<li>Brush Cleaner: $20</li>
<li>Aprons: $30</li>
<li>Materials for Perks: $120</li>
<li>+ Taxes &amp; Fees</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for your generous contributions I will be giving you original artwork and vouchers to these painting events I have been talking about! </p>
<p><strong>Mini-Paintings</strong>: I will be creating a series of one of a kind original artworks on 3”x3” canvases. Each one will be different, but inspired by nature and in my same fun vibrant style. What you get will be a surprise! Hang it in your kitchen, bathroom, on your fridge, or place it on a bookshelf!</p>
<p><strong>Paint Party</strong>: A ticket to an upcoming paint party. My first events will be fun paint parties with themes like California Wildflowers, Whales, Mermaids, Waves, and more! Bring a snack and a beverage and I will provide the materials and instruction. I plan to get these started in May 2018 if this campaign is successful.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Painting</strong>: For larger contributions I will create a custom 8”x10” painting. I will be taking requests if you have preferences on subject matter &amp; color scheme. These requests can be sent by email after making your contribution. If you do not have a preference, the painting will be a surprise!</p>
<p>If I do not meet my campaign goal, I will use what funds are raised and spend a little extra time being thrifty - look for tables and chairs secondhand. I would need to be more creative and wait a little longer to realize my goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will support art and creativity in the community. My goal with the painting parties is to bring together people who may otherwise not paint due to fear or being too busy, and make the process fun and relaxing. Afterwards, my artists will bring home a piece that brings the creator joy and preserves a memory. By offering workshops and classes, I will help other artists hone in on their skills. I wish to support those who want to begin their creative journey.</p>
<p>My long term vision for my art business always comes back to the environment. By building a thriving business for myself, I hope to be able to eventually be able to contribute back to environmental organizations that work to protect our natural world.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I, Esther Mallouh, am an independent curator of Science/Art exhibits.  </p>
<p>My exhibits have at their hearts the pursuit of new connections, explorations and presentations at the nexus of the sciences and arts.  I specialize in cultivating dialogues between scientific and artistic inquiry through collaborative exchanges.  </p>
<p> Visit <a href=""http://www.mind-matters.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mind-matters.org</a> to view my previous exhibit.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.asaboveasbelow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>As Above As Below: cosmic and brain webs</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>The Metaphor:</strong>  What laws govern the way networks grow and change, from the smallest brain cells to the growth of mega-galaxies? How close are we to understanding the commonalities between networks large and small?</p>
<p>As Above As Below explores those laws, the galaxies within, and the connection between all levels of existence in the universe, from the most immense with the very smallest.  </p>
<p>The exhibit features 9 new media artists interpreting ramifications of the collaborations between  7 Astrophysicists and 6 Neuroscientists who are drawing  parallels between galactic and neuronal networks.  Meet our collaborators:</p>

<p>Thank you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are inviting you to contribute towards a $7,000 goal.  The funds will be used to underwrite the cost of materials and equipment needed to produce the installations. Each installation is unique and still in development at the time we're launching this campaign, but some of the items needed include software, projectors, live plants, and audio systems.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, the funds received will be distributed equally amongst the artists to help reduce their out-of-pocket expenses.  </p>
<p>For contributions of $75 or more, you will receive a thank you card from one of our collaborators.</p>
<p>For contributions of $200 or more, you will receive the exhibition poster signed by some of our collaborators. </p>
<p>For contributions of $500 or more, you will be acknowledged on asaboveasbelow.com.</p>
<p>For contributions of $1000 or more, you will receive a sketch of yourself drawn by one of the participating artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As Above As Below spearheads the exchange of knowledge and scientific investigations between Astrophysics and Neuroscience through an intriguing new topic.  Will their investigations influence research into the preservation of humankind in the far distant future?</p>
<p>Albert Einstein once said:  “The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed.”</p>
<p>At the very least, we hope to increase awareness of the latest advances in this two incredible fields of science, and to inspire new thoughts, ideas and dreams among viewers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All of our artists are pulling from their personal funds to create their installations even as I write this. A critical part of supporting the arts means supporting artists so they can keep making art sustainably. </p>
<p>If we don't make our goal, some of our artists will be financially set back, but the installations will still be finished. We're all committed to As Above As Below.</p>
<p>The collaborators and myself are reaching out to our friends and colleagues to enlist their support. Please join us.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I, Esther Mallouh, am an independent curator of Science/Art exhibits.  
My exhibits have at their hearts the pursuit of new connections, explorations and presentations at the nexus of the sciences and arts.  I specialize in cultivating dialogues between scientific and artistic inquiry through collaborative exchanges.  
 Visit www.mind-matters.org to view my previous exhibit.
As Above As Below: cosmic and brain webs
The Metaphor:  What laws govern the way networks grow and change, from the smallest brain cells to the growth of mega-galaxies? How close are we to understanding the commonalities between networks large and small?
As Above As Below explores those laws, the galaxies within, and the connection between all levels of existence in the universe, from the most immense with the very smallest.  
The exhibit features 9 new media artists interpreting ramifications of the collaborations between  7 Astrophysicists and 6 Neuroscientists who are drawing  parallels between galactic and neuronal networks.  Meet our collaborators:
1. Joel Primack - Astrophysicist|Olaf Sporns - Neuroscientist|Forest Stearns - Artist
2. Mark Neyrinck & Miguel Angel Aragon Calvo - Astrophyscists|Michael Silver - Neuroscientist|Anastasia Victor - Artist
3. David Weinberg - Astrophyscist|Dan Feldman - Neuroscientist|James Morgan, Thea Kinyon Bhoodoo, Cory Bloyd, Yagiz Mungan
4. Jeffrey Kruk - Astrophysicist|Tamira Elul- Neuroscientist|Yoon Chung Han - Artist

<p><i>Hi!  I’m Nadia, a full-time professional artist and art teacher in Hawaii. </i> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>I LOVE EVERYTHING ART!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Learning to trust our inherent creative nature is essential....</i></p>
<p>This is where my art school comes in.  My passion is to make sure children get access to art education. For many kids, painting, drawing, and sculpting is a powerful outlet for the immense amount of energy we all have, as some kids learn visually or kinesthetically. </p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES YOUR CHILD LEARN?</strong></p>
<p>The process of making art helps us all connect to and trust our true nature.  As a child, I learned to problem solve first with my body and then secondly with my mind.  We are all creative beings and with guidance, we can all trust that and channel that energy. </p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?</strong></p>
<p>I am running this Indiegogo Campaign to raise money to complete the construction of my new art school in Waimanalo.  To be ready for the summer school sculpting, painting, and drawing classes, the buildout must be completed by June 1st, 2021.  I already have one local public school, an all-girls private school and many home school children signed up for these classes.  Art education is essential.  Help me help them.</p>
<p>It will take $9,000 and more to finish the construction.  This money will be used to purchase the materials and pay the construction crews to complete the roof between the 2 buildings the kids will sculpt under, build the raised floor they will work on, and run the electric lines from the main building to the art buildings.  With the remining money I will purchase an electric ceramics kiln and more complex sculpting tools and equipment for the kids.  Many members of the local community have already donated their time to build, clean, paint, and assist me in the move of all the equipment and tools.</p>
<p>I built out my last art studio/school over a period of 7 years. However, this time it is urgent, due to an unplanned business location move.  The school year ends at the end of May.  The students and parents are expecting a sculpture, painting, and drawing facility the first week of June. I am confident the buildings will be completed on time for the children.  These kids will have our help.  I am highly disciplined and organized and that is how I shifted from no art business/art school to a thriving creative art business where I sell my art globally with a steady stream of students all year.   I have the construction crews already scheduled.</p>
<p><strong>It will take $9,000 + to complete the build-out by June 1st, 2021.  </strong></p>

<p>Started by tumblr user @thats-frogs-babey, Anuras is a collaborative work that combines the talents of over 30 authors and artists to celebrate something they all love-- frogs. Amphibians are becoming extinct at a rate that far surpassed any other group in the animal kingdom, but they get little attention. While forces like habitat loss, the fungal infection Chytridomycosis, and global warming fight against frogs, scientists aren't receiving the funding they need to protect our froggy friends. Anuras is a collection of people that want to change that. All proceeds from the zine will go directly to conservation and education efforts, as we do our part to help the amphibians we hold so dear. (The name Anuras comes from the scientific name for the frog family, Anura!)</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>What we need?</p>
<ul>
<li>We need money to be able to produce the zine in a physical form, ideally upwards of 150 backers.</li>
<li>We need people to fund the purchase of pins, keychains, and prints, ideally around 50 backers for each.</li>
<li>Last, but certainly not least, we are raising money for conservation, so as much profit as is possible. </li>
</ul>
<p>What you get?</p>
<ul>
<li>It all depends on your tier!</li>
<li>Everyone who donates will get a digital copy of the zine, but it doesn't stop there! You have the opportunity to get physical copies of the zine, unique prints by some of our incredible artists, an enamel pin, and an acrylic charm keychain.</li>
<li>You also get the confidence of knowing that you're helping to preserve the beauty of our earth and its creatures for the generations of the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>At least a quarter of amphibian species on earth are threatened with extinction, but compared with birds and mammals, our froggy friends receive a severe lack of funding. According to the US Fish and Wildlife service, in 2014, they received a budget of ~83 million dollars. From 2010-2014, amphibians as a whole only received around 1.03 million. If we are assuming the budget of the service stayed relatively constant, at 80 million a year for those four years, wit would indicate that amphibians, the most at risk vertebrates, are only receiving about .003% of the USFWS budget each year. Clearly, the scientists need our help. By funding and supporting Anuras, you're helping fund studies, protect habitats, and save the frogs.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Just because you can't afford to support Anuras or frog conservation right now, doesn't mean you can't do anything!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out! Share Anuras information with your friends, family, coworkers, weird old neighbor, whoever will listen to you!</li>
<li>Share Anuras information via social media! Check out anuras-afrogzine.tumblr.com!</li>
<li>Make others aware of the crisis facing amphibians. Email your lawmakers! Educate yourself and others</li>

And in the musical world, the word ""score"" has a certain assumed meaning: the rendering of a piece of music in ink on a piece of paper, using a complicated system of notation where circles and lines indicate parameters such as pitch, rhythm, instrumentation, and more. But there are drawbacks to this system. Often it is not possible to truly represent everything that a piece of music might contain, especially hard to quantify things like emotional expression and tone color. Some composers discovered that the limitations of scores could be something to celebrate, where intentional omission of certain aspects left more of the performance up for interpretation. Eventually this led to variations on conventional Western musical notation but it also continued far beyond it, including text, charts, and graphics.</p><p>If the goal of a score is to present a performer with information helpful in the realization of the piece, then surely things other than this standard notation (or indeed, ink on a page at all) could be scores, and in fact, perhaps better than conventional ones in certain situations. Why not an object? Why not a whole entire piece of visual art? This is where SCORE was born.</p><h3>The Event</h3><p>At this event, the score will be a large-scale fabric installation created by Val Galstad. Consisting primarily of white tulle and white thread, the piece appears ""blank"" from afar but close inspection will reveal the intricate details of Val's handiwork. It will cover a wall in the performance space and stretch out into the third dimension, where it will encounter various objects, performers and the audience.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564358821/cmmig8dmf94bxujmlzbg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Katherine Evans and Matt Cichon, two Portland-based dancers and choreographers, will collaborate with me to produce a genre-breaking interpretation of the piece that will inspire all of the senses. The performance will take place in, under and around the installation itself. The construction of the fabric piece is ongoing, so while we can plan and rehearse, no one can know exactly what the event will look like, in truth not until the performance itself! This ""indeterminacy"" is part of the experience for everyone involved.</p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>The performance will take place at the lovely <a href=""https://pwnw-pdx.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Performance Works NW</a>, an awesome dance-centric space in SE Portland that specifically focuses on local experimental performance art, and we think we fit right in! We need to raise at least $700 to cover our production costs, which include venue rental, a whole lot of fabric!, props, costumes, advertising, processing fees, and most importantly, paying all of the artists involved in this highly collaborative project. This fundraising goal makes sure everyone gets paid a nominal fee, but any funds that exceed our goal will go directly to our artists in further appreciation of their dedication to their respective crafts and their commitment to making this event a reality.</p><p>This is my third production of 2019 and my second Indiegogo campaign. Check out the campaign page for 2017's <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/thaw-a-multidisciplinary-art-event/x/16727161#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>thaw</i></a> where we successfully raised $1300 thanks to donors like you!</p><h3>The Perks</h3><p>Looking for even more reasons to donate? We've got some amazing perks for certain donation levels:</p><p>$25 - Admission to the event! I like the idea of audience members becoming stakeholders in the event they are attending. In addition, you will get an online thank you, and if you're an artist, I will happily promote your latest project. Let's support each other!</p><p>$50 - In addition to attending the event and your online thank yous, you will receive a private dance lesson from Matt Cichon in Portland! Or you can choose to receive a mini text score by Justin Bulava. A score made with ink on a page, but no notes to be found!</p><p>$100 - You will receive all of the above perks PLUS a brand new, one-of-a-kind, mini fabric score hand made by Val Galstad! Your own private ""SCORE""? Incredible!</p><p>Please allow until September for fulfillment of the $50 and $100 perks.

The construction of the fabric piece is ongoing, so while we can plan and rehearse, no one can know exactly what the event will look like, in truth not until the performance itself! This ""indeterminacy"" is part of the experience for everyone involved.What We NeedThe performance will take place at the lovely Performance Works NW, an awesome dance-centric space in SE Portland that specifically focuses on local experimental performance art, and we think we fit right in! We need to raise at least $700 to cover our production costs, which include venue rental, a whole lot of fabric!, props, costumes, advertising, processing fees, and most importantly, paying all of the artists involved in this highly collaborative project. This fundraising goal makes sure everyone gets paid a nominal fee, but any funds that exceed our goal will go directly to our artists in further appreciation of their dedication to their respective crafts and their commitment to making this event a reality.This is my third production of 2019 and my second Indiegogo campaign. Check out the campaign page for 2017's thaw where we successfully raised $1300 thanks to donors like you!The PerksLooking for even more reasons to donate?

<p><strong>Bird watching through Puerto Rico</strong> is a one of a kind <i>artist book</i> that documents my bird watching experiences, as I explored different ecosystems in Puerto Rico. It includes <i>actual sounds and illustrations</i> that intend to capture the true essence of what it feels like to go birding in Puerto Rico. This book originated in 2011 and was the product of the culmination of my studies at the School of Visual Arts of Puerto Rico (EAPD). Through the years, the book has been exhibited in a number of places, including Puerto Rico, New York, Miami, Turkey, Bulgaria and Berlin. </p>
<p>Thanks to the success of the book, I was invited to be part of an art residency offered by the RISOLAB at the SVA MFA Visual Narrative Department. This is the first time that I will attempt to reproduce the book as a limited edition of risograph exemplars. The book will also be translated to English and it will feature full color illustrations of the endemic birds of Puerto Rico, as well as some of its most frequent visitors and residents. </p>
<p>The simplest way to contribute is by reserving a copy of the book. For those wanting to provide additional support can opt for different perks such as bookmarks, cards and limited series of prints. </p>
<p>The real goal is to create a series of 100 books that will be enough to set a collection. For that I need to buy a large quantity of materials and supplies. </p>
<p>Please share <strong>Bird watching through Puerto Rico</strong> with friends and family, help make this real!</p>
<p>Thanks you for everything!</p>

Durante los años, el libro se ha exhibido en diferentes lugares que incluyen Puerto Rico, Nueva York, Miami, Turquía, Bulgaria y Berlín. </p>
<p>Gracias al éxito del libro, he sido invitada a ser parte de una residencia de arte en el RISOLAB, una imprenta de risografia que forma parte de el MFA del Departamento de Narrativa Visual de The School of Visual Arts en NYC. Esta va a ser la primera oportunidad para intentar reproducir el libro como una edición limitada de ejemplares risograficos. Además, el libro contendrá varias ediciones como: versión al ingles e ilustraciones full color de las aves endémicas, residentes y visitantes. </p>
<p>La mejor manera de contribuir es reservando una copia del libro. Las personas que quieran colaborar de otra manera, pueden donar o optar por alternativas como bookmarks o ediciones limitadas de impresiones en risografia. </p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p>Come join our community and get involved!</p>
<p>The project is to start a large (A3) sized scribble book and we will be using local nursery's in Australia to scribble on 20 pages to be published into a large drawing book so that yourself, artists and sketchers can have their imagination tested by creating art out of the scribbles. This will be very challenging and fun for both individuals and groups. Each page will have a unique number so that the parents and other artists are able to find the transformed art through a community based website and see all the creative ideas people have created from the scribble and compare what others see.. Once we have enough pages for the first book we will then proceed with the project to finish and hopefully we all have something amazing to share! It would be amazing to see what yourself and others can see within the scribble. If you are interested in participating or have any further questions please feel free to contact us. </p>

here are some examples done by Ruth Oosterman:
Ruth Oosterman is a Canadian artist with solo work shown around the world. She spends her time collaborating with her toddler, Eve.
A Bookworm's Dream
Painting Timelapse
The Elephant King
The Great Owl
The Lady and the Fox   What We Need & What You Get  We need $5000 dollars in order to get the book fully published and produced.  Everyone that sponsors over a certain amount of money will receive a book.  If we do not reach our goal that is not a problem as we will still continue to making the book but it will take a bit longer for funding.    The Impact  This book will really bring out the creative imagination that we all have.

<h3>The Goal:</h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>Hello, I am Chip Clawson, a sculptor who uses concrete
and ceramics. I began working in ceramics 50 years ago, then launched into architectural-scale public and private art 18 years ago, leading to my current work with fabric-formed concrete. No one else has attempted this kind of work with concrete, it is entirely my vision--and my experimentation--that has led to a place of feeling very confident in my structural techniques.</p>
<p>I recently visited the work of Edward James at Las Pozas, a Surrealist
Concrete Sculpture Garden (architectural sculptures up to 4 stories tall) in
Xilitla, Mexico.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457284530/ddvepdeb0iomd3m4q76d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This place of unending creativity was a joy and an inspiration! I am excited to follow Edward James conceptually and
build “Ode to Edward James,” a group of columns and platforms 20 feet tall and
encompassing an area 15 feet by 25 feet. This concrete sculptural structure can be viewed as a metaphysical space or a ruins. Please help me achieve this
goal by funding this project! <br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I will take
no payment for my labor (the majority of the work) but will need at least
$10,000 to accomplish the “Ode to Edward James."" The money will be used
primarily to pay for materials, but also for a structural engineer, some labor,
and equipment rental. I have already received pro bono architectural services
from Gretchen Krumm at Mosaic Architecture. I will take this project as far as
possible with the money raised and expand it further for greater impact if the funding
allows.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p align=""center""><b>Let's face it, your financial
contributions <br/>
are vital to the success of this project! <br/>
<br/>
So, please, contribute money at any level -- <br/>
because this will be the Coolest Thing You Do All Week!</b></p>
<p align=""center""><b>A financial commitment of $5 or more is just one way to help! <br/>
Be part of my team by sharing, posting, liking, volunteering to help and asking
other folks to join in the campaign.</b></p>
<br/>
<br/> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>This project pushes at
the edge of what can be created with fabric-formed concrete. I’m also opening
new ways to use architectural forms as sculpture, creating an indoor-outdoor metaphysical space that visually nudges you to imagine more, to see what once was--inviting you to picture the now-missing floor and stairways.<br/>I have been building architectural-scale sculptures for nearly 20 years. Dimensionally, this will be my largest project--both literally and figuratively--a culmination of the other complex, multi-year projects I have completed. This is a big challenge that will
provide my community decades of joy and satisfaction.
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/>I intend to build these sculptures in the city of Helena, Montana; I already have the help of Gretchen Krumm and Phil Bachofner in working
with the city building department, which is supportive of the project.<br/><br/>I have the cooperation and support
of my neighbors in building a large art project in the neighborhood. John and
Janet Andrew are allowing me access across their property several times with
concrete conveyor trucks. I will use my creative energies to solve the inevitable challenges that crop up.<br/><br/>I have a history of successfully taking on
out-of-the-box projects and am excited to begin this new exploration of urban art. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I will need volunteer help and have
a large community of friends to call on.</span> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><p>I need financial support, but I also
need help in other ways as well. Physical tasks include moving forms and scaffolding,
helping with pouring concrete and other manual labor.</p>
<p>I'm also looking for people with special skills that you
think can help me, for example,  video, shipping perks, communications,
computer support, and organizing volunteers. </p>
<p>One of the most important ways you
can support this project is to spread the word and share the excitement.
Please use all the social media tools to help me.</p>

This place of unending creativity was a joy and an inspiration! I am excited to follow Edward James conceptually and
build “Ode to Edward James,” a group of columns and platforms 20 feet tall and
encompassing an area 15 feet by 25 feet. This concrete sculptural structure can be viewed as a metaphysical space or a ruins. Please help me achieve this
goal by funding this project! 


   What We Need & What You Get





I will take
no payment for my labor (the majority of the work) but will need at least
$10,000 to accomplish the “Ode to Edward James."" The money will be used
primarily to pay for materials, but also for a structural engineer, some labor,
and equipment rental. I have already received pro bono architectural services
from Gretchen Krumm at Mosaic Architecture. I will take this project as far as
possible with the money raised and expand it further for greater impact if the funding
allows.




Let's face it, your financial
contributions 
are vital to the success of this project! 

So, please, contribute money at any level -- 
because this will be the Coolest Thing You Do All Week!
A financial commitment of $5 or more is just one way to help! 
Be part of my team by sharing, posting, liking, volunteering to help and asking
other folks to join in the campaign.

    The ImpactThis project pushes at
the edge of what can be created with fabric-formed concrete. I’m also opening
new ways to use architectural forms as sculpture, creating an indoor-outdoor metaphysical space that visually nudges you to imagine more, to see what once was--inviting you to picture the now-missing floor and stairways.I have been building architectural-scale sculptures for nearly 20 years. Dimensionally, this will be my largest project--both literally and figuratively--a culmination of the other complex, multi-year projects I have completed. This is a big challenge that will
provide my community decades of joy and satisfaction.
    Risks & Challenges
I intend to build these sculptures in the city of Helena, Montana; I already have the help of Gretchen Krumm and Phil Bachofner in working
with the city building department, which is supportive of the project.I have the cooperation and support
of my neighbors in building a large art project in the neighborhood. John and
Janet Andrew are allowing me access across their property several times with
concrete conveyor trucks. I will use my creative energies to solve the inevitable challenges that crop up.I have a history of successfully taking on
out-of-the-box projects and am excited to begin this new exploration of urban art. I will need volunteer help and have
a large community of friends to call on.   Other Ways You Can Help
I need financial support, but I also
need help in other ways as well. Physical tasks include moving forms and scaffolding,
helping with pouring concrete and other manual labor.
I'm also looking for people with special skills that you
think can help me, for example,  video, shipping perks, communications,
computer support, and organizing volunteers. 
One of the most important ways you
can support this project is to spread the word and share the excitement.
Please use all the social media tools to help me.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, my name is Laura. I’m Italian and I’m an immigrant.</p>
<p>I left my home country two days ago. Last night I took a ferry to England and now I’m travelling up to Scotland.</p>
<p>Many women before me took this journey.</p>
<p>Since 1850 a lot of Italian women followed their husbands and followed their dreams to find a better future for their families; they left their home country, facing the unknown, to build a new identity.</p>
<p>I have collected the stories of these women in a play that will open in Scotland at the end of September. The title of the play is <u><i>A Bench on the Road</i> and will open in Glasgow on 29th September</u>. The voices of these women will finally be heard.</p>
<p>However, the play is only the first step on a journey towards a broader and more ambitious project.<strong> There are other stories that I would like to share, other women that I would like to give a voice to: they are the immigrants of today.  </strong></p>
<p>To realise the entire project I would like to create:</p>
<h3><strong>An audio-visual exhibition</strong></h3>
<p>I will ask female immigrants of today to tell their stories, and to choose an image that they feel  represents their journey as immigrants. </p>
<p>Visitors will listen to the stories of these women and will view the images, hopefully connecting and engaging with what they hear and see.  My vision is that the exhibition will be able to go into schools, universities, community halls and anywhere else expressing interest as part of a community building initiative.  </p>
<h3>
<strong>A film documentary </strong><strong>created by the School of Cinema of Milan</strong>
</h3>
<p>Stefano Teodori and Monica Fenu, students in their final year at the School of Cinema, will come to Scotland to follow the rehearsal process and the tour of the show, creating a link between the immigration of the past and the immigration of the present. They will create a documentary of 50 mins that may be viewed all over Scotland, abroad and by those living in  isolated communities and not able to see the show.</p>
<p>In our history, we are experiencing a time of great confusion, dominated by fear, anger and disillusionment. We are scared to lose our identity and yet, we are not truly sure of who we are.  </p>
<p>I would like the younger generations to know about immigration. I would like them to understand how difficult it is for a person to leave their homeland, how painful to let go of  certainties, how challenging to face the unknown, and yet having little choice in the matter -  because their children are hungry and they want to offer something better to the people they love.</p>
<p>To realise this project, I would like to ask for your support. I am asking you to dig into your past memories and to connect with any experience that entailed leaving something or someone behind. Perhaps it wasn’t a personal experience but one that your parents or grandparents lived through.  Perhaps you moved only from one region to another but nevertheless left your past and faced a new beginning. We all do. <strong>We are all immigrants.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you for sharing the vision!</strong></p>

<p>Ciao, mi chiamo Laura, sono italiana e mi trovo in Inghilterra in questo momento: ieri sera ho preso il traghetto che mi ha portato qui,  adesso continuerò il mio viaggio fino in Scozia.</p>
<p>Questo viaggio è stato intrapreso da tantissime donne prima di me: centinaia, migliaia di donne sono arrivate in Inghilterra e poi con il treno, quando potevano permetterselo, oppure a piedi, sono salite a nord fino in Scozia per cercare una vita migliore, per offrire ai loro figli un futuro migliore. Donne emigranti ricche di coraggio pronte a sacrificare tutto per il bene di chi amavano.</p>
<p>Dal 1850 fino ad oggi,  una strada ininterrotta di passi accompagnati dalla speranza, valigie piene di storie e di ricordi che queste donne hanno lasciato e che restano incise nella memoria dei loro figli e dei loro nipoti.  Ho avuto la fortuna di raccogliere queste storie, grazie ad un progetto sostenuto dall'Italo-Scottish Cluster (Università di Edimburgo)<br/>  </p>
<p>Ho raccolto le loro testimonianze e ne ho fatto uno spettacolo, dal titolo<i> <u>A Bench on the Road</u></i><u>, che debutterà  a Glasgow il 29 di Settembre</u>: le loro voci prenderanno vita sul palcoscenico di tanti teatri scozzesi e sul quello milanese del Piccolo Teatro di Milano.</p>
<p>Io però ho una visione più grande e più ambiziosa di cui lo spettacolo è solo una parte.</p>
<p><strong>Vorrei far sentire anche altre voci: sono le voci delle donne emigranti di oggi; perchè anche oggi si emigra, si cerca un futuro migliore.  Si spera. La speranza fa nascere il coraggio.</strong></p>
<p>Per realizzare l’intero progetto vorrei creare:</p>
<h3><strong>Una mostra audio-visiva</strong></h3>
<p>Chiederò alle donne emigranti di oggi di raccontare la loro storia e di scegliere un’immagine che le rappresenti o che rappresenti il loro percorso personale. I visitatori della mostra ascolteranno in cuffia le storie di queste donne e guarderanno le immagini, trovando, io spero, ispirazione, risposte o anche semplicemente una diversa comprensione di questo fenomeno storico che ci riguarda tutti in tutto il mondo.  La mia visione prevede che la mostra entri nelle scuole, nelle università, e raggiunga tutte quelle comunità che esprimono interesse sull’argomento.   </p>
<h3><strong>Un documentario realizzato dalla Scuola di Cinema diretta da Maurizio Nichetti</strong></h3>
<p>Stefano Teodori e Monica Fenu, studenti dell’ultimo anno della Scuola di Cinema, verranno in Scozia per seguire le prove e la tournèe dello spettacolo A Bench on the Road, intervisteranno gli emigranti di ieri e di oggi e realizzeranno un documentario di 50 minuti come testimonianza storica della migrazione dall’Italia alla Scozia, ieri come oggi. Questo documentario potrà essere visto in tutta la Scozia, all’estero e in tutte quelle comunità isolate presso le quali non sarebbe possibile portare lo spettacolo.  La mia speranza è che possa anche girare l’Italia.</p>
<p>Siamo in un periodo storico di grande confusione, dominato dalla paura, dalla rabbia e dalla disillusione. Abbiamo paura di perdere la nostra identità, ma al tempo stesso, non sappiamo più chi veramente siamo.   </p>
<p>Vorrei che le nuove generazioni sapessero cosa significa essere un emigrante, cosa significa lasciare il proprio paese,  spogliarsi della propria identità per cucirsene addosso un’altra con grande fatica e con non poco dolore; affrontare l’Ignoto perché le cose non vanno, perché si ha fame, perché c’è una guerra, perché i propri figli stanno male.</p>
<p>Per realizzare l’intero progetto, chiedo il vostro aiuto.   Vi chiedo di scavare nei vostri ricordi e di riportare alla memoria il momento in cui avete dovuto lasciare qualcuno o qualcosa di caro alle vostre spalle e andare altrove. Forse non è accaduto direttamente a voi, ma ai vostri genitori o ai vostri nonni.  Forse non siete andati troppo lontano, magari avete semplicemente cambiato città; tuttavia avete comunque lasciato il passato e affrontato un nuovo inizio. Lo facciamo tutti. <strong>Siamo tutti emigranti. </strong></p>

<br/><b>This coloring experience is powerfully different. </b>The drawings were created using age-old energy systems like Tai Chi and Qigong, used for both health and relaxation. When I began practicing a Qigong system I learned over 20 years ago, I realized early on that the energy (sometimes called chi) was moving my body, not the other way around. The energy flowed into the artwork I was creating, which resulted in a way of drawing I labeled Energy Art. The energy comes through these pages as you color them, building and strengthening the energy pathways throughout your body the same way Qigong or Tai Chi does. The more you color, the feeling of peace and stillness you feel during the process will continue even after you finish coloring. To increase the benefits of this coloring book, there are also instructions for a simple Qigong movement you can do before you color. Here are a few of the pages from the book:<p> </p>

This coloring experience is powerfully different. The drawings were created using age-old energy systems like Tai Chi and Qigong, used for both health and relaxation.

Here are a few of the pages from the book: 

 It’s almost as if the drawings are a visual language only the soul knows. As you flip through this intriguing book, you will notice you are drawn to specific pages for no logical reason. This approach to art has a way of reaching us at a deep level, beyond our logical mind. You will enjoy seeing what drawing leaps out at you and seems to be saying “pick me!” for that coloring session. Select it and get busy diving into the experience of what the drawing has to offer you. Let go of any “rules” about coloring and do what you want to with your colors and method of coloring. You may feel motivated to cut your page into pieces with which you can create a collage. It’s up to you! You will be rewarded with more peace, more creativity, more ability to focus and certainly more fun and joy.

The benefits of this experience are long lasting. After you finish your first coloring page, take a few moments to quietly focus on it.

We are fighting for people's rights globally, not only because we believe passionately that all individuals should live with freedom, safety and equal opportunity, but also because we want to contribute to a more fair and just international society. Any violations of people's fundamental rights affect all of us.
One of the projects we are working on challenges a business that is drilling for oil off indigenous people's land, without consent or consultation, while they remain in refugee camps. This is an important project that your donation could go directly towards supporting. Another developing project addresses the conditions of detention of refugees and asylum seekers in Australian offshore detention centers, by challenging both the government and corporate investors. A third project challenged the accreditation that the Irish College of Surgeons provided to Bahraini hospitals as education facilities, despite their serious mistreatment of doctors and protestors. 
The small amount of money we're looking to raise may cover the costs of field visits, data collection and interviews. This will enable us to gather vital information to make the legal cases using innovative transnational angles, in order to improve the lives of people affected. 
GLAN is currently run solely by volunteers, so all funds raised will go directly to project costs, and truly making a difference to those who suffer violations of the most basic of human rights. We thank you kindly for your support, and please get in touch if you would like to discuss further.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<p>Boomerang Festival is a global indigenous
arts &amp; culture event aimed at Aboriginal access for
audiences wishing
to engage
with a
quality, unique, true Indigenous experience. </p>
<p>It encompasses dance, weaving, carving,
talks &amp; ideas, workshops, music &amp; authentic cultural
exchanges between Aboriginal &amp; non-Aboriginal people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With full support of and in conjunction with Bluesfest Byron Bay's Festival Director, Peter Noble, produced from an Aboriginal perspective
by one of Australia’s most accomplished &amp; respected Artistic
Directors,  and proud Bundjalung woman,
Rhoda Roberts (Sydney
Opera House, The Dreaming Festival,  2000
Sydney Olympic Games Opening Ceremony, Garma Festival), Boomerang Festival is programmed with
high-quality performance art, featuring masters of craft &amp; cultural leaders
from around the globe. </p>
<p>Boomerang ran successfully in 2013 in Byron Bay, on the Bluesfest site, to widespread audience and critical acclaim. It was nominated for several major arts and tourism awards, and contributed significantly to the local tourism and economic sectors.</p>
<p>However, both arts and Indigenous funding was cut, and forced the indefinite suspension of what was heralded as new way forward in harmonious relations for all Australians, and imperative national healing.</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Parkour trains the body and brain to communicate
more effectively and have coordinated effort in movement as well as everyday
tasks; it is a playground for adults and children in which skills you gain in a
facility directly relate to life outside the facility; builds quickness,
endurance, balance, flexibility; agility, and explosive strength; cultivates
self-knowledge, self-trust and self-confidence; challenges you to push past
limitation</span><br/>

aboriginal men, or those claiming aboriginal background or following. We
presented our approach on behalf of the Circle of Indigenous Nations at a

Red Path
Movement teaches Parkour that goes beyond. Currently has
a mobile service traveling throughout the West Kootenays and beyond. 






We desire to settle in and create a Parkour
gym in Nelson. 





We combine Parkour, aspects of Experiential Education and teachings of the Medicine Wheel, where the relentless curiosity and imagination of
the physical nature of Parkour and intrapersonal growth come together on the
Red Road. We create a space for movement, integrate it with experiential
learning through reflection providing an opportunity for integration and
self-growth.  


Mel, one of our assistance mentors at Origins in Vancouver. 

In PARKOUR you will: 



 Learn to manage
risk in a healthy and positive way


Learn about
your limits


Engage in a
full body workout


Think on your
feet


Develop a can
do-it attitude that leads to greater confidence







Another aspect of Red Path Movement is business and team development.
Through experiential learning we
help guide your business or team to a better understanding of their potential. With
EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING we create: 



A safe
environment for exploration


An engaging
and supportive environment


A structure
for reflection


A space for feedback
throughout the process







Red Path Movement utilizes MEDICINE WHEEL TEACHINGS as a framework. Using this as a framework: 



It breaks away
from linear and conventional thinking

self-understanding


It encompasses
a number of tangible outcomes

To have our mentors create challenging and fun experiences, based on age and developmental levels, in which the student takes initiative, makes decisions and are accountable for results through analysis, reflection and the opportunity to integrate what they learn
To create an environment where relentless curiosity and imagination of the physical nature of Parkour, and interpersonal growth come together on the Red Road
We link movement with experiential learning, through reflection, providing an opportunity for integration and self-growth 
Another aspect of Red Path Movement is team

found out, that for me is more and more important not only to express myself
through music, but to find a new way to show the audience they personal reasons
to be, while listening the language of music, experiencing the magic of theatre. I discovered that my roots began to call me back and that my childhood dreams
of what is all about raised themselves up again, and I could only follow them.

GAME opera project by Anna Mikhailova
Do you BELIEVE in OPERA? 
Do you believe in FOOTBALL?Time to act, JOIN!I’m Anna Mikhailova, composer and theater director, and I choose for both.
Imagine, 3 FOOTBALL TEAMs, an
OPERA, and an audience, all together in one place, creating the performance,
and YOU can be part of it!
Featuring 8 organs, 8
saxophones, 8 singers and 1 trombone player, forming 3 football team, 3
referee, 1 goal keeper, 2 ball keepers, 4 commentators, 8 gates and 8
substitute players.
It only takes one drop to start a waterfall:Dear friends,How are you?I am still busy creating my latest project - a combination of opera and football, in one multi-disciplinary performance with:3 teams, 1 goalkeeper, 21 balls, 9 saxophones,8 organs,10 voices,Mother of Jesus, Jeanne D’Arc, Margaret Thatcher, Lucebert-Lucifer, Asger Jorn, Guy Debordand you!As you can imagine, this is quite an undertaking, and although I do not usually ask for help, in this case, I truly believe that this project is worth it. With this in mind, I started a funding campaign for the first time in my life, but because of the lack of support I had to cancel the première (November 2015). So if you could help by supporting me with even a very very small contribution and spreading my message to the world, the opera can be realised. Thank you very much for your time.It only takes one drop to start a waterfallAnd here is the backstage of my project.
Where
is the story in football and where is the game in opera
WHAT is it? It has always been an OPERA, holding her BREATH in
the corner of our universe. The XXIst century is the time for her to rise,
to free her from her shell, and to let
her meet an attractive, physical and playful football game.
Of course, my goal is not to
make a performance of football players running around while singing Wagner. I
am developing the elements of the football and opera to integrate them more
deeply, so they will reinforce one another. Opera should learn from football
how to inspire the happy intensity of feeling that you are present, as you
watch teams playing with the ball. I am curious to see how football ACTIVITY
can grow within the RULES OF OPERA.
It is about TRADITION and TRANSFORMATION.
It is about YOUR OWN
EXPERIENCE and everyone else.It is always about UNIVERSAL
versus PERSONAL, as we know without a team there is no football, but what is
football without a ball and opera without the voice?
WHO is
the HERO of opera today?ULTIMATE GAME is part of a sequence of operas, on which I have worked
for the last five years, inspired by the lives and thoughts of the
Situationists. Searching for the hero and the story of my NEW OPERA PROJEC five years ago,
I came across the art and works of this group of artists and thinkers Situationists International, a movement of the 50s, 60 and 70s, associated with ideas like the New Babylon Project, the Dérive and the Society of the Spectacle.
Through their international approach, through working directly within everyday life and not only with paintings and performances, but through an
extensive body of theoretical writing, they have influenced the reality we live
in today.
Our WORLD, whether we want it or not, was CREATEd by the
generation of our grandfathers and grandmothers. The Situationists International were most known for envisioning a
revolutionary new world, beyond the restrictions of everyday life in
capitalism, a world in which work would be given to machines and life would be
an adventure.
They are of the generation of my grandparents. Real people, with their
own life experience, not scientifically proven molecules or elves from a
fantasy world, far apart from our reality. No, they were real, they thought and
wrote for real, they were trying to work their way through/out of the reality
they found themselves in. That is inspiring. My work explores how their thoughts
remain fertile for us, today, more than six decades after 1950s. Can we today
still think a better world to live in?
I do BELIEVE that opera can be more than a museum and
period drama sung bell canto, and with every opera I make, I challenge myself
to find new activities and areas for expressing this idea. 
In order to renew itself for our society, OPERA needs the SITUATION,
which will bring the NEW EXPERIENCE, in which you are not expected to know
everything in advance, but free to experience the MOMENT through
active PRESENCE.
In my earlier operas of this project, looking for paradigms and new modern heroes and
stories, I came across Frankenstein, Spiderman and Prometheus, the power of
Advertisement and the Alchemy of the creative process. For that reason every
layer of my opera project consists not only of an opera performance, but as well contains additional sound/visual/mind experience with installations,
performances, flashmobs, books, new media and other dimensions.
During my research I discovered that one of the members,
the artist and philosopher, Asger Jorn came up with the idea of THREE SIDED FOOTBALL
I started to think, what if the OPERA is not
based on a STORY, but on a structure, and that structure would be a GAME, and
that game would be FOOTBALL, and specifically, football with 3 fields and 3
teams! So now I am exited to SHARE with you my ULTIMATE
GAME opera project, where elements of football and opera meet each other.
ABOUT ME
I have been doing music since I was 6 years old and I
love to speak this language. After graduating from the Rotterdam
University of Arts (Codarts) as a theater director (2013), from Den Haag Royal Conservatory as a composer and sonologist (2011), from Moscow conservatory
(2007) as a composer, organ player and koto player, after working with impro,
jazz, pop, rock musician, with dancers, after going on
expeditions to collect folk songs, after writing music for movies,
animations, theater and computer games, after moving from on place to another, 
after working on several operas, performances, installations, which gave
me an amazing experience of the team work and collaboration; playing in
different bands, as techno, pop, impro, jazz, rock, industrial, experimental, I
found out, that for me is more and more important not only to express myself
through music, but to find a new way to show the audience they personal reasons
to be, while listening the language of music, experiencing the magic of theatre. I discovered that my roots began to call me back and that my childhood dreams
of what is all about raised themselves up again, and I could only follow them.
I began to approach music again from zero.
I keep learning it, and during last 10 years, I have
been actively researching the possibilities of the human VOICE, the human BODY,
creating LANGUAGE and translating it into performance space, merged in the
WORLD OF OPERA. I truly believe that LANGUAGE OF the OPERA can speak and live,
touch us and expand meaning in 21-century music theatre.I have had much experience
playing football, being young and giving fully myself to the game, following
the ball, feeling present, passing it to your partner, achieving the GOAL with
your TEAM and right now I am looking forward to find a dynamic point, the power
point/ the power ball, which would bring opera to its NEW APPEARANCE.

I do need your help in SUPPORT of an intense rehearsal
and preparation period, which involves production costs, including costs for
collecting equipment, finalizing the instruments, made especially for the
occasion of this opera and based on the organ and the bagpipe, arranging a fee
for performers who are going to study, learn and perform the multiple scores of
text, notes and movements for you to feel how football can meet opera.
And since it is going to take place in several locations
of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and Rotterdam, I would like to ask you to
SHARE my message with everyone you think who BELIEVEs in
opera and in my music.

This project is a unique continuation of the tradition of the sound
walks or wonder walks of the situationists, and I’d like to invite you to JOIN my journey of discovery. 
OPERA BOOK 
For contributing to my project, I will share with you a
very special and personally made unique art work. (I do not believe in 10 euro
for a kiss.[standart perks procedure])
For each of YOU who BELIEVEs in OPERA, in my project and
WILLing to SUPPORT it, I am preparing something very SPECIAL and exciting,
something what I would like to appear as a part of the opera experience – a NEW
MEDIUM – a unique, personal, YOUR OWN experience of the opera, that you TAKE
WITH YOU after the show and which will contain part of the opera within it. 


I call it an OPERABOOK.

I shared this idea with a few artist friends, whose art I find inspiring
and close to the field I am working in and they agree to collaborate with me on
it and I am glad to share with you some of their names:


Samuel Vriezen, Arefeh Riahi, Pim Piet, Amy Wu, Cissie Fu


Each OPERABOOK will be a unique work of art in itself,
having elements of opera, book, performance, story, situation, sonic experience
and made to be a NEW MEDIUM, a KEY to open the world of opera FOR YOU,

<p><strong>What is Fidgetting? What is a Fidget Toy?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fidgeting, also known as restlessness or wiggling nervously, is the act of moving restlessly. This can be the result of nervousness, agitation, boredom or a combination of these states. Fidgeting may involve playing with your fingers, hair, or clothing items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A common act of restlessness is to bounce a leg repeatedly, as well as to touch a ring, or rotate and rotate along a table incessantly. It is often considered to move continuously as a bad habit, especially in schoolchildren.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fidgeting is generally considered a nervous habit, often related to the lack of discipline and self-control, although a number of underlying benefits have recently been found. People who regularly struggle tend to weigh less than people who do not fret because they burn more calories than those who are still. It has been reported that it also burns about 350 extra calories a day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the same time, research by Dr. Karen Pine and her colleagues at the University of Hertfordshire found out that children who were allowed to move with their hands performed better in memory and learning tests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That is why, and for a long time, there are toys that are used to channel these seemingly uncontrollable energies. A Fidget Toy is not a mere anti-stress game picked up at a fair or a random object with which you might be fiddling long during a meeting or work session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the purpose of distraction? To evade responsibility? Not at all. It has been scientifically proven to focus that “restless” part of the mind in a relatively easy task. Simply manipulate an articulated object to help increase overall concentration, which can also be fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides, <strong>Fidget Toy</strong> is a generally small object (preferably one that fits in the hand), which can be squeezed, pulled or moved in some way. Fidget Toys come in all shapes, sizes and textures for all tastes. Objects such as stress balls, tangled elastics and others can be used as Fidget Toy to promote movement and tactile input that is critical for the learning of some students and many adults.<br/><br/><strong>Fidget Toys</strong> are affordable, easily understandable and attractive to all ages and genres. That is why there is the Snake Cube, a Fidget Toy. The same that us, Cuboid Fever, want to help to improve.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483110426/x7onr4iftuxvkaexazz0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Fidget Toys</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, how can we help each person to control their movements and actually improve their concentration and learning? A Fidget Toy could not be the obvious choice.</p>
<p><br/>Understandably, a <strong>Fidget Toy</strong> could quickly become a distraction for many so it is important to set clear boundaries regarding the use of these in the classroom or work sessions. But, Fidget Toys have been shown to be useful self-regulating tools that help concentration, attention, calmness and active listening.</p>
<p><br/>Research on <strong>Fidget Toys</strong> shows that if the person's constant movement can be directed, learning can be improved since movement is essential for learning because it allows the individual to use both left and right hemispheres of the brain.</p>
<p><br/>In addition to other research confirming the importance of movement and sensory input while learning, learning is enhanced when movements are introduced, as documented through case studies and a comprehensive understanding of human cognition and learning of the students.</p>
<p><br/>In a video on Child Development, two boys around the age of 12 were placed in two different classrooms with headphones, listening to a lecture on brain development. One of the boys was told to sit still and just listen to the lecture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other boy also had to listen to the same lecture, but he was allowed to hold, squeeze and bounce a tennis ball at the same time. In the end, each child was asked to remember some key points of the conference.</p>
<p><br/>Surprisingly, the amount of knowledge the boy allowed to ""move"" could get from the conference was greater in comparison to the other boy who was told to stay still.</p>
<p><br/>Evidently, there could have been other factors that contributed to the different amounts of information these guys could remember, but it was quite apparent that being able to engage both the mind and the body simultaneously made a big difference.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, the <strong>Snake Cube</strong> is a <strong>Fidget Toy</strong>: small, affordable, easily understandable and attractive to all ages and genres. Also known as Hamiltonian Cube, it is an old craft mechanical puzzle, often made of wood. It consist of a chain of 27 little cubes, connected by an elastic band running through them. The little cubes can rotate freely and the aim of the play is to arrange the chain in such a way that they will form 3 x 3 x 3 cube.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Traditionally, the <strong>Snake Cube</strong> is usually made following the same old combination of small cubes. In fact, who already knows the solution will not discover in a regular Snake Cube any new challenge.</p>
<p><br/>That is why <strong>Cuboid Fever </strong>presents new combinations of the <strong>Snake Cube</strong>, at a fair price and in an attractive display. That is: <u>new fun challenges that you can afford and take to your home, workplace, holidays or wherever you want.</u></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is J. Claire Dean and I have been fascinated by stereocards since I was a kid (you know, those funny, curved cards with a pair of apparently identical photographs pasted to them, but when looked at through the right kind of viewer, you can see them in 3d). In 2004 I bought my first vintage stereo-camera and I have been dabbling in the art of created stereo-imagery ever since.  </p>
<p>For some time I have wanted to build a mobile, public exhibit space for stereo- (or 3d) photography. To bring the artwork of photographers, past and present, who shoot in 3d to a greater audience. Eventually I developed the idea of the Puddletown Panorama – a multi-station viewing device, inspired by antique stereoviewers and using the format of the stereocard. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488331679/m2ywmxphhmlqvdbudlrj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><i>A general overview of  our scale model of the Puddletown Panorama and its custom tow vehicle, the Puddletown Puller. <i>""Puddletown"" is one of Portland, Oregon's many nicknames, and it seemed to suit this project which is being built in  it's namesake city. </i></i></p>
<p>Up to five people at a time will be able to view unique sets of 3d images in the form of stereocards  at each of the stations. The subject matter will vary, depending on venue and the type of event.  I have received overwhelming interest from fellow stereophotographers who have already started sending me their images for inclusion in the Puddletown’s collection of cards. This is not a short term project; I intend to grow this venture into the future as our library of images expands, and word spreads of our willingness to bring stereophotography to your community. Now we just need to get it built and on the road. </p>
<p>The entire Puddletown Panorama, in a livery of British racing green with cream and gold trim, has the look of an early 20th cent. circus, or carnival, sideshow with Victorian remnants peeking out around the edges.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is the first of two planned fundraising campaigns.  Why two?  Well, we would like to get started with our project as soon as possible and so we need seed money for supplies and materials to get us underway.  That is what this first $5,000 campaign aims to accomplish.</p>
<p>Our current budget for building the Puddletown Panorama is $15,000.  With $18,000 we can make the lighting more extensive and sophisticated, and include our custom tow vehicle, (the “Puddletown Puller”) in the overall build.  Right now we are working on reducing our final costs as much as possible by searching for donations of materials and services.  In the meantime we could be starting to build, so we are asking you to help get us off the ground by contributing to this initial campaign.  </p>
<p>To recognize your belief in our project by donating so early, we have created the title “Puddletown Philanthropist”,  which will be gratefully bestowed on anyone who supports this first campaign.  Among this campaign’s rewards (see the list to the right) are exclusive Philianthropist  patches and hoodies that will only be available during this fundraiser. </p>
<p>We are also reserving this title for our build crew, the photographers who donate their artwork, and donors of materials and services, so you will be joining an extraordinary group of supporters.   On top of that you will receive our endless gratitude. </p>
<p>Reaching this first goal is important, but any level of funding we achieve will help us get started.</p>

<h3><strong>Why support us?</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s face it – there will never be enough ways to bring art and creativity to the world.  You will be backing a winner. The crew building the Puddletown Panorama are no strangers to creating unusual and interactive art works.  Helping us build the Puddletown Panorama will be one way you can bring a little more fun and wonder to a broad, public audience, while at the same time supporting numerous artists by providing a new space in which to show their work, all while also enabling us to share our building skills.  This can only result in inspiring creativity in others.  Not a bad return for your donation.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any crowdfunding campaign is a challenge, taxing one’s time and patience alike, however, I have been involved in several successful ones in the past, including two of my own (both Kickstarter campaigns that were funded beyond their goals). I am fully aware of the risks and challenges they pose and I am prepared to guide yet another.</p>
<p>My professional life is within the arts and museum world as a self-employed art conservator, running a small business for over 20 years. Organizing, managing, building and completing exhibitions and similar projects is part of my life.  The Puddletown Panorama is another exhibit space – only this one is particularly close to my heart.</p>
<p>I am surrounded by a crew of like-minded and experienced people and so I feel that our main risk is simply not raising the necessary funds.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute financially, we understand.  Maybe you can help us by donating tools, materials or time (especially if you are in the Portland area), so get in touch.  </p>
<p>Spreading the word about our project, especially through social media, is one of the best ways to lend your support – especially during this campaign.  Please share this project with as many of your friends and family as you can – the Indiegogo share tools make this really easy!  That’s how crowdfunding works. That’s a powerful gift for our project. Thank you.</p>

Short Summary
My name is J. Claire Dean and I have been fascinated by stereocards since I was a kid (you know, those funny, curved cards with a pair of apparently identical photographs pasted to them, but when looked at through the right kind of viewer, you can see them in 3d). In 2004 I bought my first vintage stereo-camera and I have been dabbling in the art of created stereo-imagery ever since.  
For some time I have wanted to build a mobile, public exhibit space for stereo- (or 3d) photography. To bring the artwork of photographers, past and present, who shoot in 3d to a greater audience. Eventually I developed the idea of the Puddletown Panorama – a multi-station viewing device, inspired by antique stereoviewers and using the format of the stereocard. 


A general overview of  our scale model of the Puddletown Panorama and its custom tow vehicle, the Puddletown Puller. ""Puddletown"" is one of Portland, Oregon's many nicknames, and it seemed to suit this project which is being built in  it's namesake city. 
Up to five people at a time will be able to view unique sets of 3d images in the form of stereocards  at each of the stations. The subject matter will vary, depending on venue and the type of event.  I have received overwhelming interest from fellow stereophotographers who have already started sending me their images for inclusion in the Puddletown’s collection of cards. This is not a short term project; I intend to grow this venture into the future as our library of images expands, and word spreads of our willingness to bring stereophotography to your community. Now we just need to get it built and on the road. 
The entire Puddletown Panorama, in a livery of British racing green with cream and gold trim, has the look of an early 20th cent. circus, or carnival, sideshow with Victorian remnants peeking out around the edges. Illuminated by both LED lighting and gas lanterns, the Puddletown Panorama is decorated with fancy metal work, gilding, hand painted artwork and lettering, the entire piece forming an  intimate space, itself a demonstration of art and craftsmanship in the service of a special type of photography.

The drum-like device in the center of the photograph is the multi-station, stereocard viewer, the ""Panorama"". Behind each pair of eye pieces is a sterocard viewer loaded with its own unique set of  3d cards.  Having viewed one set,  you rotate the drum until  the next pair of eye pieces is in front of you, at which point a whole new set of cards is ready to be explored behind those lenses.
 

This is the Puddletown Puller, our custom tow vehicle designed to move the Panorama and its crew  around within larger events.  When travelling to and from venues, the Puller rides on the main platform - the exhibit space - along with everything else packed around it.  The main platform serves a dual purpose; towed by a pickup truck, it is the main transportation trailer for the project,  and once at an event it transforms into the exhibition space featuring the Panorama. 
 
Our build group comprises a mix of skilled, experienced artists, makers and craftsmen and          -women, as well as  eager newcomers, all volunteering their time and expertise. Most of us have experience building other community projects and take great satisfaction in sharing our skills with others, inspiring them to discover their hidden talents and creativity.  Your support will allow us to not only build something for everyone to enjoy, but to continue sharing our abilities and encouraging others to discover their own.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Kaden Sinclair and I am representing a whole community of builders, artists, and technical experts. Our group, the Idaho Burners Alliance (a 501c3 nonprofit) is hoping for your support in building something amazing. Donate to this project and we can send you a charitable contribution receipt for your taxes! </p>
<p>The campaign to help build MesmerElda is the build costs for phase 1 of the project. The first phase will be to build the rings and lighting. The second phase will be to build the viewing platform and stairs. With these funds, we can proceed with hiring a metal bending service to provide us with the materials needed to build the rings.</p>
<p>By helping with this project, you are entering into the community responsible for building it. That means your help combines with others to create the entirety of the project. No one person will build this. It will be built because of community support, like yours.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The entire project is projected to cost about $58,000 for Phase 1. Don’t wince! There’s good news. With in-kind donations, we have brought the cost down to $27,000. </p>
<p>With the funds you so generously put forth, we will be buying materials. All rental of the shop, all labor, all consulting (architectural and structural), all programming, soldering, and light design are entirely volunteer driven. The materials we will purchase will be metal, LED’s, computers and power for the LED’s, and various tools and parts and pieces. Because the upper platform will be a separate phase, we are targeting to complete just the rings (upper and lower).</p>
<p>Aside from just the coolness factor of saying you were involved, we also intend to get t-shirts and mugs out to our contributors (with the MesmerElda project image on them).</p>
<p>Large donors ($1000 or more) will receive a 3d print of the original structure for your very own!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aside from the amazing spectacle of structure and lights, this project will provide an entire community with a way to create and be proud of their work. The benefits to a community are vast. Depression, feelings of isolation or lack of purpose, and even just wishing to be a part of something outside of the daily norm all come into play. The act of creating is an anodyne. Any person helping to create this art work can pull up an image of it and proudly say “I helped. Because of me and others like me, this project came to life”.</p>
<p>In addition to displaying for the week of Burning Man, with a journey to the playa for multiple years, this project will have a permanent home as public art in Boise Idaho and anyone in the city will see this project and be able to play with the lighting, creating unique patterns. It will also be available on webcam. It is designed to be moved and thus can be present for many years at the burn, along with touring. </p>
<p><strong>What if you don't get your requested funding?</strong></p>
<p>Easy! We take what you have given us and build part of MesmerElda. If she gets 40% built, we will work toward other campaigns and fundraisers and apply for other grants and build the rest! It seems like a lot to ask to build an art project, but it's really not. When you reach out to thousands of people, the smallest contributions add up fast. Spread the word!</p>
<p><strong>Previous work</strong></p>
<p>To give you an idea of how we actually complete stuff, because hey...it's important to know this will become a reality, you can view our previous projects at the following sites. </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlaPkz5Tr9k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlaPkz5Tr9k</a></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Just passing the word helps a great deal. 100 people giving $5 means $500. A thousand people means $5000. So get the word out there! Small amounts add up to great things when enough people come together.</p>
<p>We are also a full 501c3 nonprofit. That means we can accept material donations. So, if someone or some business wishes to provide us with metal, plexiglass, LED’s, tools, or computer systems in order to run the lights, then we can give them a receipt for their donation!</p>

What if you don't get your requested funding?
Easy! We take what you have given us and build part of MesmerElda. If she gets 40% built, we will work toward other campaigns and fundraisers and apply for other grants and build the rest! It seems like a lot to ask to build an art project, but it's really not. When you reach out to thousands of people, the smallest contributions add up fast. Spread the word!
Previous work
To give you an idea of how we actually complete stuff, because hey...it's important to know this will become a reality, you can view our previous projects at the following sites.

Other Ways You Can Help
Just passing the word helps a great deal. 100 people giving $5 means $500. A thousand people means $5000. So get the word out there! Small amounts add up to great things when enough people come together.
We are also a full 501c3 nonprofit. That means we can accept material donations. So, if someone or some business wishes to provide us with metal, plexiglass, LED’s, tools, or computer systems in order to run the lights, then we can give them a receipt for their donation!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

I'm Rana Hamandi, I am a design addict with 10 years of experience. I am the founder of 'iltdesign'. A design studio that offers a blend of creative fields from branding and print designs, to web and digital designs.
 
Throughout my career, I have been stuck with a handful of creative ideas but not knowing how to actually get them done. This struggle was due to the lack of executers' exposure in the design industry in Lebanon.
Upon experience, I have noticed a big number of creatives reaching out through Social Media platforms to find executers for their projects. Unfortunately with no results.
 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


 
 
DERECIPE was born thereafter: from a design struggle to simply a passion. A passion to track sources to connect them with designers.
 

What is Derecipe?
Derecipe, is a one of a kind search engine specific to the design industry needs. It Allows designers and creatives to find all sources needed to transform their ideas into reality without hassle and with high time efficiency.   
Derecipe allows them to perform their search within the smallest detail needed throughout their project execution, encompassing materials, techniques, products or even simply skills. They will notice that searching for such information and contacts, has never been easier or more accurate, which makes Derecipe the first of its kind in the field.
Designers will be able to narrow their search by selecting a specific interest such as printing services, executers, and suppliers. 
No fee is required to search or being listed on Derecipe.
 



 
 

 
 
A Passion Strike!

 
As I researched this project further, I found out a different world that I have never been familiar with. A world of talents exploitment.
When I began to wander the streets to track big companies, factories, small stores up to talented individuals. I got introduced to the hard living condition of many talented individuals and craftsmen. They are literally hidden treasures that no one promote due to their own personal profits.
Witnessing their hard living condition and the bad experiences of exploitment they went through, made me even more passionate to help them by exposing them online, and giving them an opportunity to stand out where they have no presence.
Hoping Derecipe will make a small difference in their lives.

 
 

Arpi, is a very talented lady, that touched me deeply with her story. Wishing Derecipe will make a small positive impact in her life.

<div>My name is Lee Phillips and I am a 18 year old writer and photographer from Washington D.C.</div> <p></p>
<p>I am currently working on a interactive journal zine. In short, this is a journal combining the words of young people all around the world with space to write and draw in. I'm sending out notebooks to teens in places like Pakistan, France, Spain and many others along with manila envelopes to put things in such as pressed flowers, a sticker anything that they liked or that made an impression on them. </p>
<p>The young people write in the journal for one month (anything from grocery lists to intense poetry) and then send it back to me! I pick out pieces of the journals sent back, collage them and arrange and leave space for the reader to write in their own thoughts (hence the journal aspect). What I expect to receive back in these journals are a wide range of words that express the diversity of young minds across the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Soo what exactly am I doing? In a pinch, curing the teen world of that lonely feeling and angst. Just kidding- but really...</p>
<p>So many times we feel like we are alone in how we feel. I remember as a kid feeling like no one understood what I was feeling. If I knew then that everyone suffered and laughed and thought and lived just like I did, I don't think I would have felt half as lonely. By collecting all of our voices and personalities in one single journal, we are not just creating a journal, but a act of solidarity. The goal is to emphasis how universal our emotions are while at the same time, interacting with the reader by leaving places to add their own voice and journal their own thoughts in response to (or independently) the content already on the page. </p>
<p>Growing up, all the journals I had were blank pages. The blank page always intimidated me. To me-it implies that once my thoughts are on the paper they are alone. Why does the page have to be blank?  We are not alone in our thoughts and we shouldn't have to feel like we are. In this day and age of technology and communication I still don't feel closer to the world- maybe even farther. Because of this every piece of genuine connection and solidarity must be cherished.  Looking at a page full of the thoughts, hopes and dreams of teens all around the world not only inspires original thought but creates a atmosphere of belonging. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Studio Current was founded in 2004 by Vanessa DeWolf as a place for process, practice, and radical autonomy. For 13 years we've been right in the heart of the Pike/Pine corridor supporting artists, activists, and our community. We've welcomed the under represented folks, outsiders, insiders, names and shapes big and small and been a safe space for those that really need one.  It's been magical, and it might be more important now than ever. <strong>WE HAVE A UNIQUE AND EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO GROW AND EXTEND OUR OUTREACH!!</strong> Who would have thought that'd be the case in this odd and off-putting political climate? But it's true, and we need your help to do it.</p>
<p>We've moved kitty corner to The Wild Rose, Under Annex Theater, underground with Salon Dewi, and right next to Vermillion Bar and Gallery - and we couldn't be happier about our neighbors! We're still in the heart of the corridor, still welcoming and being the queer, and still supporting and valuing the complexity and diversity of what goes on in lives and culture shaped by creativity and communication. Upsizing has many great advantages. <strong>We can host your dance and music performances, your installations, rehearsals, workshops, and classes</strong>. And that's just getting started. Of course upsizing our space also means that our operating costs - namely our rent - has also risen. But check it out - <u>it's less than doubled</u>. We have 2 movement studios now, a community room, a full on kitchen, and a storage/muti-media room. It's a small miracle that our rent went up as little as it did with all these new assets. A huge thank you is due to our fantastic landlady Anne Michelson, who adores Studio Current and is a brilliant supporter of the arts and community that is capitol hill. So, for us to grow, we have to raise money.</p>
<p>Now for many years Studio Current had been able to exist under the radar and incredibly nourished because Vanessa DeWolf personally sponsored the space and charged artists very minimally and sometimes not at all to rehearse or take part in seasons of residencies. Some monetary support was provided by these artists, a few fabulous patrons (we love you!), and most of the responsibility fell on Vanessa. She lovingly and characteristically gave everything, including time, energy, creativity, and lots of hugs, as well as the rent each month. But it couldn't last forever like that, so we're evolving. We've panicked, we've rested, and we're not giving up. Good fortune has followed us through rocky times, and we know if we keep at it she will continue to buoy our travels.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago Vanessa handed off the Artistic Directorship to me. I've been a working artist for 20 years and have spent over a decade teaching and plying my craft here in the Capitol Hill neighborhood as well as around the world. I love this place, but i recognize that creative culture needs support - much more support than it is given in our country in general. I'm just learning how to do this job, on the fly, and like Vanessa so far I've been supporting it personally. This fundraiser is a huge turning point for Studio Current, and meeting our goal would mean that we have a little time to get a few more stable support systems in place. It would mean that Studio Current can support art, artists, and our community more and better. And plain and simple, meeting this goal means that Studio Current can continue to exist.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We're hoping to raise $30,000 - about half of our annual operating costs. This covers our rent and while that may not sound exciting, it's huge for us! It means that costs don't get passed down to artists who can't afford it, and it means that SC remains accessible to so many more people. It also means that we can allocate other resources to other much needed things like:</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>- $3000: new Marley covering for our brand new sprung floor in 2nd movement studio<br/>- $2000: update, repair, and install lighting and sound systems and projectors<br/>- $3000: covers moving costs including deposits, insurance on the spaces for a year, and the moving van and labor fee.<br/>- $1000: update and upgrade storage system so our resources are readily available to the community and resident artists have storage space<br/>- $1000: update website, cover costs for promotional materials like a sign for our new location and event supplies like programs and fliers</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>That's the kind of difference you can make by helping us get to just 1/3 of our goal - $10,000! Why? We want to offer more to our community, and we can, but we need a bridge of support while we work toward sustainability. </li>
<li>
<strong>We're still run by volunteers, and that's not changing yet.</strong> Nobody gets paid money for the work they put into running this space, it's already a labor of love, and we're willing to keep at it! But we need your help!</li>
<li>We've got some super unique perks for you. Check 'em out. Special thanks for special support!</li>
<li>We're going to give this our best shot, but if we don't make it all the way we won't give up. We're doing everything we can to become sustainable, but much like the standard model, we rely on about 1/3 of our funding from donations in fundraisers like this.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're so close to being able to do more amazing things for artists and our community, we just need some support to help us get our footing along the way. Right now our artists and community organizers need support. Studio Current has long been a safe space, a hub of culture and creativity, and right now we are growing and need your support to do so. Creative culture, local artists, and community gatherings need support. Our goal is to continue to nourish and find new and better ways to support creative culture, autonomy, and community. We want to bring you more art enjoying, more art making, more viewpoints, and more opportunities to do the kinds of things you want to do. This is your world! Studio Current is <u>safe space</u> and is here for <u>you.</u></p>
<p>Right now there are 10 artists in residence for a 9 month long season of art making. There are 7 artists working as directors also in creative process for the season. That's 17 local artists that you'll be directly supporting with your gift! That's amazing, but that's not all. Every day Studio Current hosts rehearsals for artists that aren't in residence here, but need a space to work. We host photography and filming sessions, dance, theater, and music practice and performances, workshops, classes, potlucks, fundraisers, and birthday parties. </p>
<p>We're moving as fast as we can toward sustainability and everyone in the organization is doing a great job, but it's just not fast enough to pay the bills yet. All rental fees go to rent, as well as the artist fee from our residency program. This leaves us with about $2000-$3000 each month that we need help to cover. Over the next 4 months (if we can keep running!) this ratio will shift. We're writing grants but not wishing too hard on that star. We're starting a new series called Studio Current Sessions that will feature a variety of local artists and in a show every month. Proceeds from this series go to Studio Current and will help us cover costs.  We're also introducing some special classes and events to help fill the gap. They'll be low priced, but as we've said before, every little bit helps!</p>
<p> In the meantime we're running this campaign to try to save our placement in all 3 studios in the new location. You can make a huge difference right now for the local artistic community by supporting Studio Current. You can absolutely help shape the culture you want to be a part of! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(We're very lucky to have a fantastic landlord that supports us and our vision. Even so, the neighborhood has and is shifting so rapidly and drastically. The MAD team is made of magic, we have massive opportunities for growth and support in creating culture that manifests creative solutions to real problems. Help grow our culture!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us spread the word! Every little bit truly makes a difference and we appreciate it from the bottom of our wild wild hearts. The more folks hear about this the better. We'd love everyone to come in and be a part of SC. Oh, and donations help too. $5 or $50 or $5000 - it all goes directly to the same place and it absolutely all makes a difference! Please share our links, tell our story, come take a class or put on a show, host a discussion or craft night, have a rehearsal or just roll around on our floors - we want you and thank you!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Studio Current was founded in 2004 by Vanessa DeWolf as a place for process, practice, and radical autonomy. For 13 years we've been right in the heart of the Pike/Pine corridor supporting artists, activists, and our community. We've welcomed the under represented folks, outsiders, insiders, names and shapes big and small and been a safe space for those that really need one.  It's been magical, and it might be more important now than ever. WE HAVE A UNIQUE AND EXCITING OPPORTUNITY TO GROW AND EXTEND OUR OUTREACH!! Who would have thought that'd be the case in this odd and off-putting political climate? But it's true, and we need your help to do it.
We've moved kitty corner to The Wild Rose, Under Annex Theater, underground with Salon Dewi, and right next to Vermillion Bar and Gallery - and we couldn't be happier about our neighbors! We're still in the heart of the corridor, still welcoming and being the queer, and still supporting and valuing the complexity and diversity of what goes on in lives and culture shaped by creativity and communication. Upsizing has many great advantages. We can host your dance and music performances, your installations, rehearsals, workshops, and classes. And that's just getting started. Of course upsizing our space also means that our operating costs - namely our rent - has also risen. But check it out - it's less than doubled. We have 2 movement studios now, a community room, a full on kitchen, and a storage/muti-media room. It's a small miracle that our rent went up as little as it did with all these new assets. A huge thank you is due to our fantastic landlady Anne Michelson, who adores Studio Current and is a brilliant supporter of the arts and community that is capitol hill. So, for us to grow, we have to raise money.
Now for many years Studio Current had been able to exist under the radar and incredibly nourished because Vanessa DeWolf personally sponsored the space and charged artists very minimally and sometimes not at all to rehearse or take part in seasons of residencies. Some monetary support was provided by these artists, a few fabulous patrons (we love you!), and most of the responsibility fell on Vanessa. She lovingly and characteristically gave everything, including time, energy, creativity, and lots of hugs, as well as the rent each month. But it couldn't last forever like that, so we're evolving. We've panicked, we've rested, and we're not giving up. Good fortune has followed us through rocky times, and we know if we keep at it she will continue to buoy our travels.
A little over a year ago Vanessa handed off the Artistic Directorship to me. I've been a working artist for 20 years and have spent over a decade teaching and plying my craft here in the Capitol Hill neighborhood as well as around the world. I love this place, but i recognize that creative culture needs support - much more support than it is given in our country in general. I'm just learning how to do this job, on the fly, and like Vanessa so far I've been supporting it personally. This fundraiser is a huge turning point for Studio Current, and meeting our goal would mean that we have a little time to get a few more stable support systems in place. It would mean that Studio Current can support art, artists, and our community more and better. And plain and simple, meeting this goal means that Studio Current can continue to exist.
What We Need & What You Get

 
We're hoping to raise $30,000 - about half of our annual operating costs. This covers our rent and while that may not sound exciting, it's huge for us! It means that costs don't get passed down to artists who can't afford it, and it means that SC remains accessible to so many more people. It also means that we can allocate other resources to other much needed things like:
 
- $3000: new Marley covering for our brand new sprung floor in 2nd movement studio- $2000: update, repair, and install lighting and sound systems and projectors- $3000: covers moving costs including deposits, insurance on the spaces for a year, and the moving van and labor fee.- $1000: update and upgrade storage system so our resources are readily available to the community and resident artists have storage space- $1000: update website, cover costs for promotional materials like a sign for our new location and event supplies like programs and fliers
 

That's the kind of difference you can make by helping us get to just 1/3 of our goal - $10,000! Why? We want to offer more to our community, and we can, but we need a bridge of support while we work toward sustainability. 

We're still run by volunteers, and that's not changing yet. Nobody gets paid money for the work they put into running this space, it's already a labor of love, and we're willing to keep at it! But we need your help!
We've got some super unique perks for you. Check 'em out. Special thanks for special support!
We're going to give this our best shot, but if we don't make it all the way we won't give up. We're doing everything we can to become sustainable, but much like the standard model, we rely on about 1/3 of our funding from donations in fundraisers like this.

</div></div>","Hello, I'm Teodoro and I'm a five years old Italian boy. I love pirates , rock music, playing in the mud , and most of all I love painting with my dad . When I Grow up I want to become an artist .


My dad is writing for me this story, because I do not know how to write.
Since I was 2 years old, it was very clear to me that in the future I'll be an artist.I love to draw, paint, make collages, art installations and little sculptures. I'm a good dancer & I love cooking as well.

This is my project

At the moment I sell my works in order to achieve my goal: save a little amount of money in my piggy-bank to study art around the world.

The school where I would go is the Central Saint Martins school of art, in London UK.
These are a couple of pictures from there, isn't beautiful?!

Here you can find some pictures of me drawing, painting, discovering art or climbing mountains!


Here I'm drawing




Here I'm discovering Caravaggio, the Italian Master


Here I'm climbing mountains


These are some of my latest collages. Enjoy!

Parque de la Amistad / Friendship Park es un lugar de encuentro

 Monument Mesa, dentro del Parque Estatal de California, Border Field 
State Park.  Del lado Mexicano se encuentra en la plaza del Faro en 
Playas de Tijuana. Desde hace muchas generaciones, personas de buena 
voluntad de los dos países se han reunido en este sitio histórico para 
convivir con familiares y con amigos a través de ""la línea.”</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290355/files/20150312120700-2014_Familiares.jpg?1426187220"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>What is the project?</b><p>We
 want to make the park a friendlier place. Although on the Tijuana side,
 the park is surrounded by a lively beach town, the US side is gated 
off, hard to get to, and carefully guarded. </p><p>The first thing we 
want to be able to do is install more seating in the park. At the 
moment, there is only one bench in the garden. We want to make the 
visiting space more comfortable and welcoming, especially for families 
with young children or elderly people. We hope that this seating will 
change the culture of the park to be more inclusive and allow for more 
natural conversations. James Brown, a member of Friends of Friendship 
Park and architect at Public Architecture and Planning, will take the 
lead on this project. </p><p>If we successfully fund the seating, our 
second goal is to set up Whisper Dishes. We will put dishes on the 
outsides of the park; one across the border in Mexico, and one at the 
edge of Border Field State Park, outside of the fence that closes off 
Friendship Park. The dishes will be available for families and friends 
to access during the times that the Friendship Park gates are closed. 
This will provide an alternative for working families who may be unable 
to come to the Park during the limited hours on the weekends. Daniel 
Watman, member of Friends of Friendship Park and head of the Binational 
Gardin as well as Border Encuentro, will oversee this portion of the 
project. Dan hopes to work with 4walls International, a local group that
 creates sustainable structures out of trash, to build the dishes. 
Although the set-up of the dishes is complicated by the fences that 
secure the border, Dan and his group Border Encuentro facilitated a test
 run in 2009 that confirmed the feasibility of this installation.</p><p>Next,
 we want to install a telescope on the Tijuana observation deck, and 
keep a telescope on hand on the US side also. This idea is based off of a
 Border Encuentro event in which telescopes were made available on both 
sides of the border during hours that the US side of Friendship Park was
 not open<i>. </i>Mexican sign language students on both sides of the 
border helped relay messages. This installation would be a visual 
compliment to the Whisper Dishes, which rely on auditory interaction. 
Both projects aim to expand access and ease communication across the 
wall when Friendship Park is officially closed during weekdays. Dan will
 also head this project. </p><p>Lastly, any funds in excess would go 
towards completely designing the park.James and the Friends of 
Friendship Park have been working to come up with a plan for a truly 
bi-national park, where there are no physical borders bisecting the 
park. We also want to be open about what kind of alternatives are 
possible for this space, and share possible future plans with potential 
donors. <br/></p><p><b>Cuál es el proyecto?</b></p><p>Queremos hacer de este 
Parque un sitio más accesible y amistoso. Al contrario del lado de 
Playas de Tijuana en donde el Parque está rodeado por una comunidad

</p><br/></div>","What is Friendship Park?Friendship Park / El Parque de 
la Amistad is an historic meeting place on the US/Mexico border, 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  In the U.S. Friendship Park is located 
atop Monument Mesa, inside California's Border Field State Park.  In 
Mexico, El Parque de la Amistad sits beneath the famous lighthouse (""El 
Faro"") in Playas de Tijuana.  For generations people of good will from 
both nations have gathered here to visit with family and friends ""across
 the line.” ¿Que es El Parque de la Amistad?El 
Parque de la Amistad / Friendship Park es un lugar de encuentro 
binacional en la frontera entre México y los EE.UU., al lado de la playa
 con vista al mar.  Del lado estadounidense se sitúa encima de una mesa,
 Monument Mesa, dentro del Parque Estatal de California, Border Field 
State Park.  Del lado Mexicano se encuentra en la plaza del Faro en 
Playas de Tijuana. Desde hace muchas generaciones, personas de buena 
voluntad de los dos países se han reunido en este sitio histórico para 
convivir con familiares y con amigos a través de ""la línea.”What is the project?We
 want to make the park a friendlier place. Although on the Tijuana side,
 the park is surrounded by a lively beach town, the US side is gated 
off, hard to get to, and carefully guarded. The first thing we 
want to be able to do is install more seating in the park. At the 
moment, there is only one bench in the garden. We want to make the 
visiting space more comfortable and welcoming, especially for families 
with young children or elderly people. We hope that this seating will 
change the culture of the park to be more inclusive and allow for more 
natural conversations. James Brown, a member of Friends of Friendship 
Park and architect at Public Architecture and Planning, will take the 
lead on this project. If we successfully fund the seating, our 
second goal is to set up Whisper Dishes. We will put dishes on the 
outsides of the park; one across the border in Mexico, and one at the 
edge of Border Field State Park, outside of the fence that closes off 
Friendship Park. The dishes will be available for families and friends 
to access during the times that the Friendship Park gates are closed. 
This will provide an alternative for working families who may be unable 
to come to the Park during the limited hours on the weekends. Daniel 
Watman, member of Friends of Friendship Park and head of the Binational 
Gardin as well as Border Encuentro, will oversee this portion of the 
project. Dan hopes to work with 4walls International, a local group that
 creates sustainable structures out of trash, to build the dishes. 
Although the set-up of the dishes is complicated by the fences that 
secure the border, Dan and his group Border Encuentro facilitated a test
 run in 2009 that confirmed the feasibility of this installation.Next,
 we want to install a telescope on the Tijuana observation deck, and 
keep a telescope on hand on the US side also. This idea is based off of a
 Border Encuentro event in which telescopes were made available on both 
sides of the border during hours that the US side of Friendship Park was
 not open. Mexican sign language students on both sides of the 
border helped relay messages. This installation would be a visual 
compliment to the Whisper Dishes, which rely on auditory interaction. 
Both projects aim to expand access and ease communication across the 
wall when Friendship Park is officially closed during weekdays. Dan will
 also head this project. Lastly, any funds in excess would go 
towards completely designing the park.James and the Friends of 
Friendship Park have been working to come up with a plan for a truly 
bi-national park, where there are no physical borders bisecting the 
park. We also want to be open about what kind of alternatives are 
possible for this space, and share possible future plans with potential 
donors. Cuál es el proyecto?Queremos hacer de este 
Parque un sitio más accesible y amistoso. Al contrario del lado de 
Playas de Tijuana en donde el Parque está rodeado por una comunidad 
llena de vida, del lado de los Estados Unidos, el Parque está cerrado, 
su acceso es difícil y está cuidadosamente protegido.Lo primero 
que deseamos hacer es colocar más bancas en el Parque. Hasta ahora hay 
una sola banca y se encuentra en el jardín.  Queremos hacer un espacio 
más agradable  y cómodo especialmente para las familias con niños 
pequeños y personas de edad avanzada. Esperamos que este espacio con

</div></div>","Short SummaryThe North Star Museum of Boy Scouting and Girl Scouting is the only museum in the world that takes as its subject the history and impact of Girl Scouting and Boy Scouting in the upper Midwest (for us, this generally means Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Iowa, with a bit of Nebraska thrown in for good measure). The museum is an independent history museum that uses Boy Scouting and Girl Scouting as a lens through which to view the past. We are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Order of the Arrow, the 
camping honor society of BSA this year with a large, new exhibit entitled Firm Bound in Brotherhood: A Century of Cheerful Service. We will be telling the larger national OA story through a regional lens.
  What We Need
 We need $19,500 in order to create an exhibit that is interesting and eye-catching. We will be using some of the funds to build new cabinetry into which we will place the objects and outfits that we have to show. We will be spending money on making very good exhibition prints of vintage photographs. We intend to create a short video of individuals, explaining what the Order of the Arrow has meant to them. We also want to create a mural-sized photograph to cover the windows in the exhibition gallery space. 

$12,000 for the custom cabinetry
$4,000 for graphics for the exhibit (photographs and labels)
$1,100 for large window covering
$2,400 for audiovisual production and hardware to show it

  
What You Get
All supporters $25 and over get a special invitation to a sneak preview of the exhibit in early June
Supporters who contribute $25 will receive a bronze exhibit patch
Supporters who contribute $50 will receive a gold exhibit patch
Supporters who contribute $75 will receive a silver exhibit patch
Supporters who contribute $100 will receive a silver jacket back patch

Supporters who contribute $200 will receive all three patches, mounted in a display folder AND a jacket patch

Supporters who contribute $500 will receive recognition on the exhibit's support plaque and . . .

If you did your Scouting in the upper Midwest, you are likely to find something very personal in this exhibit.   Challenges  Because we have not tried to produce an exhibit like this before, we feel challenged by it.
