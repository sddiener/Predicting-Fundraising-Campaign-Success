<h3>Who's Agent O?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Agent O is me, Oana Calugar. I love tech entrepreneurs and I want to bring value to the startups I work with. </p>
<p>I coach startups in my work with TechAngels, the Romanian based business angels network for financing tech startups. And I'm also part of the support team of a pure breed startup from San Francisco -- Weebly.</p>
<p>Because of my love for startups, I've been invited to receive the the official <a href=""http://nciia.org/LLP"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lean Launchpad for Incubators/Accelerator</a> training at Columbia University in New York. The seminar is offered to incubator / accelerator managers by Steve Blank and Jerome Engel. If you're working in a startup and don't know who Steve Blank is, go an <a href=""http://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read this now</a>. </p>
<p>The seminar is for those who want to use <a href=""http://steveblank.com/category/lean-launchpad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lean LaunchPad method</a> to build portfolios of new startups or new businesses inside existing companies.  I'll learn how to use the Lean LaunchPad and a rigorous ""get out of the building"" process <b>to accelerate product/market fit</b> and <b>customer validation</b>.  And I'll know how to adopt and adapt the Lean LaunchPad method for the startups I coach and for your incubator or accelerator.<br/></p>
<p>While I'm coaching startups with the experience I have from working in IT startups and companies for the last 4 years and the knowledge from <a href=""http://steveblank.com/books-for-startups/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">books for startups</a>, I want to take it to the next level and bring an amazing knowledge in Europe too.

<p>Your help is needed to bring the The LeanLaunchpad of launching startups to Europe. <b>Agent O is counting on you. European Startups are counting on you! </b></p>
<p>It's for the future of European entrepreneurs and our advantage for years to come. With a one-time effort, together we can bring the world's leading startup entrepreneurial education from US to Europe. </p>

<h3>The Smooth JavaSpot</h3>
<p><span>Hey, my name is Robert. I created <strong>The Smooth JavaSpot</strong> to be a ""comfort spot"" a place to ""really"" relax and enjoy a great cup of Jo. I developed the concept so that it will provide a wonderful coffee house experience...a smooth java experience. Why Coffee and Art? They're both great for relaxation and conversation. Sipping on your coffee, enjoying a slice of cake while looking at artwork throughout the shop is so comfortable way to enjoy an hour or two of your day. I also feel it's a great opportunity to create a place to allow artist to showcase their work(s) ""silently"" and at the same time, offer the JavaSpot patrons a chance to always be within a gallery feel. The Javaspot's <strong>""JavaWalls of art""</strong> will be for all ages and backgrounds of artists. The JavaSpot will ultimately join the community together...people meeting people of all walks. I designed all the products, the website ( </span><a href=""http://www.thesmoothjavaspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thesmoothjavaspot.com</a><span> ) and all the graphics/logos. The website </span><em>(products button will show you all the products)</em><span>. I intend on Mentoring Artist whenever needed. The JavaSpot will also have from time to time, a <strong>LiveArt  Portrait Session</strong>. I believe the <strong>LiveJavaArt Session</strong> will set us apart from all places, taking the <strong>""Smooth Java Experience""</strong> to a higher level. </span><strong>Why the strong focus on Art in this project description?</strong><span> It's a major part of the project, I feels it's important for Backers to know/see that I have a passion for art and some artistic ability. Coffee, internet access and wonderful products are just as important! :) It equally shares the spotlight (hence the provided website link for products). But the art portion is where I'm showing we can give back to the community. But, the JavaSpot isn't just for the Locals...It's a worldwide developing concept...One to reach out outline via the website and social networks to all who love art (and great coffee) products. Your contributions will make this a stronger and bolder reality!</span></p>
<h3><em><strong>Please see The Gallery for pictures of both product and my artistic ability.</strong></em></h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding for The Smooth JavaSpot will help us to obtain quality coffee/expresso machines, blenders, products, the JavaCards and the point of sales equipment/software. The funding will help provide the inserts for a seriously great sign out front as well as the outdoor cafe furniture and the interior finish out. In return, we will be creating and making a bold statement that the community has something absolutely wonderful, that you helped to create The Smooth JavaSpot. The community will also see jobs being created as well as a chance to say that ""we"" made it possible for Artist(s) to have a platform to launch from. <strong>The ""Perks &amp; Rewards"" for contributing are fantastic!</strong> Coffee products, ""Premium Chocolate"" and even Oil Portraits will be on the list for contributions. The value of an oil portrait in itself will far exceed the contribution, but the contribution to my dream far outweighs the offering of the Oil Portrait any day :)</p>
<h3><em><strong>All Contributor ""Perk Levels"" will be given a Free ""Smooth Member JavaCard"" with a Smooth Value surprise attached.</strong></em></h3>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the years, I've been a Mentor to <strong>At Risk Youth</strong>, donating my time to Police Departments in many cities, to include; <strong>Carrollton, Texas and Coppell, Texas (Chief of Police, Mac Tristan) and LT Chris Rory of the Dekalb County Georgia Police Department</strong>. Through education, mentoring and even Art, I've encouraged young people to strive for a better way, to respect their fellow man/woman and to aspire to greater opportunties and goals for their lives. I want The Smooth JavaSpot to continue offering these gestures...and now, not the just to the youth...but to all who need to be encourage that there is a better way. The JavaSpot will be a wonderful place to unite people of all walks. <strong>I'm a Veteran of The United States Air Force.</strong> I've worked and fought along side all walks of life, I've learned how teach without expecting reward, and how to give hoping that others will be inspired to do the same. Though a business is just a business to many, The Smooth JavaSpot also represents a launching pad to greater heights in uniting people. Your contributions will make this a stronger pledge to that notion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help: Your network(s) of friends, family and associates may be inclined to help in the moment, right now when I need you most. Please spread the word! Encourage those that can help, to understand that there's a greater destination through this window of opportunity for so many.

</h3>
<p>Fruit Tart started as the faux-label name of my singer/songwriter persona, <b>Rosa Diaz</b>.  A fruit tart was the most beautiful scrumptious gift that a friend brought to my place once, when she came over to practice.  Because where there is music, there are always yummy treats.  At least, at my place.  I am currently blog content and material for a follow up to my 2012 release, <i>WHIM</i>. The album will be called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">For Boys Who Like Bukowski: A Healing Album for Broken Men</span>.  I am still visioning the project and updates of research and documented ideas can be traced on the blog.  </p><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""></span><h3>Somewhere in Occitania...</h3>The traveling musician archetype of the 
troubadour (and his female counterpart, the troibaritz) is our 
inspiration!  The artistic spirit of the High Middle Ages--romance 
languages, lyric poetry, multi-stringed instruments, chivalry and 
courtly love remain the main inspiration of the many a modern 
singer-songwriter and we seek not to differentiate between the high 
nobility, those of petty noble lineage, the merchants, tradesmen and the
 poor fisherman (or woman.)  The loose association and freedom that artists will have with Fruit Tart Records also calls upon this muse.  We are planning to set ourselves up to be some combination of creative group, collaborative, collective, co-operative and association.  We'll have to sit with a few legal experts and community organizations who have trudged through that mud before us before we can actually obtain a worthy legal standing that all artists in the troupe are happy with.  What Fruit Tart aims to be is a place to rest our heads, a place to ""hold court"" and solidify already existing collaborations and friendships among the community of creatives, a flag we can wear proudly, something to push our individual efforts forward maintaining as much freedom as possible while at the same time nurturing the artistic community ethic that has aided us in growing our gifts.  <br/><br/><p><span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Introducing our Creative Types!</span><br/></span></p><p><span>We've gathered a beautiful community of artists and creatives who would like to ""hold court"" here at Fruit Tart and affiliate with us. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lounging and strumming her lute at the other end of the castle courtyard is </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: bold;"">Dylan Jane</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.  Her troupe of sometimes-y on again off again travel buddies is known quite accurately as ""The Turning Leaves.""  When she is not making bright sound with the band, or breathing a gutsy melancholy solo, she is hidden in a corner, or under a tree, writing a rhyme of courtly love, another ballad for a lost or would be mortal made god by her ink and blood, something the fortune teller somehow missed.  In the fall of 2013, Dylan Jane completed her first U.S. tour.  </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYIfmYxltUhI&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><h6 style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></h6><p><b>Bethlehem</b> and the songwriter that goes by the name of <b>""Sad"" Patrick</b> met at an open mic that Sad started in a local coffee shop in the Northwest Philadelphia neighborhood they both share.  Bethlehem quickly became the main event of the evening, drawing neighbors, friends and strangers alike with her earthy, honest voice.  With the voice of a diva, but always approachable and amicable, Bethlehem won the hearts of the regulars.</p>
<p>In her solo work, Bethlehem has been described as ""Germantown's next rising star"" by WHYY/NewsWorks Philadelphia and is primarily an acapella artist who combines her original sonic creations with vocalized rhythms as well as claps and stomps in a performance art style atop a custom-made tarima that has her name engraved in it in Hebrew letters.  Her first solo release, <a rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Bigger Than Music</i></a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, was released in November of 2012.  She also works with some notable acts as a jazz singer, including the Philadelphia Jazz Project with whom </span>she performed<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> with at TEDxPhiladelphia in 2014.  </span></p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Bethlehem brings her own color palette to Patrick's songwriting.  With her voice, she interprets the songs, combining jazz-inspired scats and spiritual dynamics to a songwriting style that is rooted in a strong folk story-telling tradition, creating a distinct sound that could perhaps be described as bluesy folk.  </p><p style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Of his previous work as a singer-songwriter, one of Patrick's most notable songs is written in the form of a would-be letter by a soldier in the battle field, narrating the events that lead up to him losing his life.  Another tells the story of a satellite that was lost in space, never to be retrieved.

 </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><b>A Healing Album for Broken Men</b></p><p>My next album project is a healing journey that will be released in two or more parts.  The first part or parts will be a collection of songs that reveals the trials and stories of an imaginary character that built around the stereotype of the twenty-first century young male fan of the writer Charles Bukowski.  <br/></p><p>The project is not a biographical sketch of Bukowski himself, nor an academic critique of his work, but an exploration of the life of the writer as a compass that the fictional character uses to guide his life and embody the glorified aspects of the famous writer, from the romanticized early life as starving artist, poet and working-class hero toiling in obscurity, to the reluctant fame, the women, the translations of work into multiple languages, the celebrity affiliations, that fantasy of the introspective would-be writer boy and main character.  In the fringes of the academia, in the midst of social anxiety and self-taught bookishness, he attempts to enter Bukowski's body of work as a lifestyle as a form of escapism from the mundane--his otherwise relatively well-balanced suburban life, the ho-hum drum of his stereotypically too-good parents, and the success with women he would actually have if it weren't for his insistence on acting the part of the real-life troubled writer, from top to bottom.  </p><p>Generally, he leads a failed life, not due to lack of resources or support, but to lack of following his own purpose and desiring the purpose and ritual of a man who did not choose his pain--Bukowski who was plagued with childhood trauma, disfigurement and pain, who, in the words of Borges, did make something ""eternal from the miserable circumstances"" of his life.  It is the privileged man who wants to drink coffee made from the feces of little rodents and make it a delicacy after his family has stolen the coffee fields and forced the original inhabitants to search in the waste of animals who may have ingested some of what they used to enjoy freely before being forced to work for another's profit, developing an archetype, the ""boy who likes Bukowski.  Misery and trauma are desirable and highly sought after, like the feces coffee, when in reality, anyone who is born into unfavorable circumstance knows, as the native people who created the coffee that is now a delicacy to those tormented by the mundane-ness of their privilege, the coffee has an origin based on survival needs and is not a beautifully wrought thing.  </p><p>The project further seeks to explore the great question of the last few centuries of patriarchal rule, ""what is wrong with men?""  But also, probes at related questions, such as, ""what is wrong with women?""  in a series of podcast interviews with musicians, artists, men and women of various occupations.   Conflicts between men and women, families, trauma, societal definitions of success, life purpose, addiction, scandal, women of the night, late bloomers, early bloomers, class warfare, childhood nostalgia, dreams, and stereotypes are some of the topics that have already arisen in conversation, song and text.</p><p>I'll also seek to find and interview religious leaders and those in the healing arts, from different tradition.  This will involve some travel that will include the recording of the second part of the album--the healing component.  Healing traditions from around the world will be surveyed and consulted to create an actual album of healing music, perhaps an exploration of meditations and trance-work.  So, the album is in two parts because the aim is not just to explore the brokenness and expose the nature of the disease that plagues the character, but to find concrete ways of healing the failures of his life and moving on to some decent progression of his soul, as a member of society and this great universe, to search for pain when none is there, there is no greater disease seen in modern man.  The point is to transcend the topic of why men this or why women that and go back to a conversation about the sources of creative inspiration, transcendence through art, and for each artist that has sort of lost ""his way,"" to at least attempt to begin to honor their own pain, not the painful abusive childhood of Bukowski's, not the blindness of Borges, not the physical pain of Frida.  </p><p>But if it's a genuine grit of another red light district night, not so much by choice but by the loneliness of a withdrawn and pathological curiosity that calls a being back to the typewriter, to throw poems at walls while drinking straight from a bottle, like those who scream in pain through broken bones and throw fits when others, perhaps, better ""trained"" or more ""successful"" artists make light metaphors about finding God through hardship, maybe there really is a light that endures after blindness, but only the seer would know.  Yes, Nietzche said suffering produces great works, but do we look for suffering?  Do we idealize the lives of those less fortunate simply because we can?  We are only witnesses, but we also each have our own story.  It's time we stop dreaming we are other people, or other people's art.  It's time we stop pretending we have the calling of others, honor our own experiences and find the real source of our own artistic inspiration, what Andalusian flamenco culture has historically referred as our <i>duende</i>, our own ""troublemaker,"" ""imp"" or ""lord of the house""--the house being our own bodies, as vehicles for movement and productivity. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy""

The Impact Your contribution will have a tremendous impact on the following: 
Florida residents: Florida will benefit from decreases in crime and increases in tax revenue & private enterprise similar to Colorado, the first state to provide the sale of recreational marijuana. Since Jan. 1, crime in Denver is down while the state's tax revenue has increased nearly $18 M and retailers have generated sales of about $70 M. 


Florida's sick and elderly: An estimated 450,000 Floridians will qualify for medical marijuana. Marijuana has been proven to help those with Alzheimer's Disease, Anxiety/Stress/Depression, Cancer, Chronic Pain, Diabetes, Epilepsy, Fibromyalgia, GI Disorders, Glaucoma, Hepatitis C, HIV, Hypertension, Incontinence, Injuries, MS, Osteoporosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Sleep Apnea and Tourette's Syndrome




Florida's patients and doctors: Unfortunately, the most recently passed FL bill approving high-CBD medical marijuana (the 'Charlotte's Web' strain) only helps a small percentage of the patients who would benefit from medical marijuana.  In addition, it places heavy burdens on physicians who wish to recommend it to their patients, arguably forcing them to violate federal laws in order to do so. There is not an ID card requirement, however, in order to be protected from criminal laws, a qualifying patient must be added to the “compassionate use registry” maintained by the Department of Health. The physician must be the individual who then “orders” the low-THC marijuana from 1 of the 5 registered manufacturers for the patient. Doing so would violate federal law. Because physicians need a federal DEA license to prescribe medicines, they are very unlikely to openly break federal law, meaning the law is almost surely unworkable. 


Popular opinion: Currently, 58% of Americans support marijuana legalization and more than 80% of Floridians support medical marijuana.

Florida's justice system: Legalized marijuana will keep 60,000 non-violent offenders out of the court system and out of jail, enabling tax dollars to be spent placing the right people behind bars.


Federal law: Despite a long medical history and countless studies on the benefits of cannabis, the Federal Government still classifies it as a Schedule 1 drug despite the fact that it has a US patent on its antioxident and neuroprotectant properties. This means that in the eyes of the Federal Government, marijuana has no currently accepted medical use, is the most dangerous of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence, and is included in the same class as heroin, LSD, ecstasy, methaqualone, and peyote.


The environment: If hemp production increases, it will have a huge impact on the planet.  Hemp fiber is the longest, strongest and most durable of all natural fibers. Hemp cultivation requires no chemicals, pesticides or herbicides and is completely sustainable. Hemp produces 4 times the fiber per acre as pine trees. Hemp tree-free paper can be recycled up to 7 times, compared with 3 times for pine-pulp based papers. Hemp is easy to grow and actually conditions soil where it grows.  Hemp would be an ideal source of biomass for fuel and hemp Ethanol burns very cleanly.

<li>Hey! Let me tell you a bit more about me - I'm Evan, a professional actor with a passion for photography (you can see some of my work below).  Raised in North Carolina, I'm a southern dude currently based in New York, and earned a minor in photography during my college years. This trip, I'll be shooting on a Canon 5D.  </li>
<li>Joining me is my buddy Brian! He's from California, and will be navigating, photo-assisting, and is a seasoned road-tripper. He's driven Route 66 in nearly its entirety, spent time traveling the whole coast and central valley of California, and is pretty much the most even-keeled person you'll ever meet. He's also an actor AND a helluva of a singer, so don't be surprised if we send out a musical thank you video or two (or three)!</li>
</ul><p></p><ul> </ul> <p><b>Where We're Going</b></p><p></p><ul><li>
<i>South</i>. Specifically, to South Carolina, Georgia (and a tiny bit of North Florida) to photograph remnants of what was once an important part of the American sensibility: the great American road trip.</li></ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/637158/files/20140609165609-Route_Photo.png?1402358169"" src="""" style=""width: 515.3958333333333px; height: 692px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>Why U.S. 301 is Special</b></p><p></p><ul>
<li>From the 1940s to the 1960s, U.S. Route 301 was the East Coast's roadtrip escape route - a gateway to Florida: the promised land of family resorts, beaches, fun &amp; sun. Nicknamed the ""Tobacco Trail,"" tiny towns near U.S. 301 in South Carolina and Georgia thrived off the tourism for years. </li>
<li>BUT, in the early 1960s, the national interstate system was built and took with it the streams of tourists.These small towns were choked off and now, sixty years on, the once-filled diners, drive-ins, motels, and kitschy roadside attractions sit vacant, falling apart and disappearing into the past.</li>
</ul><p></p><p><b>Why a Photo Book &amp; Why Now Is the Time</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Inspired by Robert Frank's <a href=""http://alturl.com/vsare"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-style: italic;"">The Americans</a><i> </i>and the vibrant motel postcard artwork of the same time period, I want to capture the shift in identity this stretch of U.S. 301 has experienced over the last 50 years. Every state has industries left in the dust, but the stark contrast between past and present on U.S. 301 is a story that desperately needs to be shared. The roadside landmarks standing today are in various stages of decay, and with proper historical information, this photo book will provide a chance for reflection on the ever-shifting traditions of travel and tourism in America.  </li></ul><ul><li>
<p>We need to capture these roadside relics while they still exist.  With each passing year, weather, new development, and natural overgrowth endanger these structures. As we near the 50th anniversary of I-95’s first segments opening in the region, there’s no better time than now to document these special landmarks before they’re gone for good.</p>
<br/>
</li></ul><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>Let's break this down:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Our Goal: $3,495</b>. This <span style=""background-color: initial;"">covers publishing costs (a majority of our budget), gas, rental car, minor equipment, and perks for you!  We're including travel and lodging costs - driving the stretch of U.S 301 in 2014 will add a unique layer to our experience and better inform the final product. By camping, paying for most food on our own, and staying with friends, we hope to keep those travel costs low. (Know someone in the area who'd like us to stay with them? Let us know </span><a href=""mailto:roadtrip301@gmail.com?subject=Project%20301:%20A%20Tip!"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">here</a>!<span style=""background-color: initial;"">)</span>
</li> <li>
<b>Everyone loves a perk. </b>We want to keep the photo book as accessible as possible, so a digital version is available at the $25 tier. The postcards will be purchased in towns along the way, and are sure to reflect the local flavor - we can't wait to share those gems with you!</li>
<li>Okay, let's put it all on the table: If we don't reach our goal, we will still make this trip, but may have to shorten the overall duration and skip some locations (Boo!). Regardless, our focus is on creating the highest-quality photo book in the end, no matter what!<br/>

Hey! Let me tell you a bit more about me - I'm Evan, a professional actor with a passion for photography (you can see some of my work below).  Raised in North Carolina, I'm a southern dude currently based in New York, and earned a minor in photography during my college years. This trip, I'll be shooting on a Canon 5D.  
Joining me is my buddy Brian! He's from California, and will be navigating, photo-assisting, and is a seasoned road-tripper. He's driven Route 66 in nearly its entirety, spent time traveling the whole coast and central valley of California, and is pretty much the most even-keeled person you'll ever meet. He's also an actor AND a helluva of a singer, so don't be surprised if we send out a musical thank you video or two (or three)!
  Where We're Going
South. Specifically, to South Carolina, Georgia (and a tiny bit of North Florida) to photograph remnants of what was once an important part of the American sensibility: the great American road trip.Why U.S. 301 is Special
From the 1940s to the 1960s, U.S. Route 301 was the East Coast's roadtrip escape route - a gateway to Florida: the promised land of family resorts, beaches, fun & sun. Nicknamed the ""Tobacco Trail,"" tiny towns near U.S. 301 in South Carolina and Georgia thrived off the tourism for years. 
BUT, in the early 1960s, the national interstate system was built and took with it the streams of tourists.These small towns were choked off and now, sixty years on, the once-filled diners, drive-ins, motels, and kitschy roadside attractions sit vacant, falling apart and disappearing into the past.
Why a Photo Book & Why Now Is the TimeInspired by Robert Frank's The Americans and the vibrant motel postcard artwork of the same time period, I want to capture the shift in identity this stretch of U.S. 301 has experienced over the last 50 years. Every state has industries left in the dust, but the stark contrast between past and present on U.S. 301 is a story that desperately needs to be shared. The roadside landmarks standing today are in various stages of decay, and with proper historical information, this photo book will provide a chance for reflection on the ever-shifting traditions of travel and tourism in America.  
We need to capture these roadside relics while they still exist.  With each passing year, weather, new development, and natural overgrowth endanger these structures. As we near the 50th anniversary of I-95’s first segments opening in the region, there’s no better time than now to document these special landmarks before they’re gone for good.

What We Need & What You GetLet's break this down:  
Our Goal: $3,495. This covers publishing costs (a majority of our budget), gas, rental car, minor equipment, and perks for you!  We're including travel and lodging costs - driving the stretch of U.S 301 in 2014 will add a unique layer to our experience and better inform the final product. By camping, paying for most food on our own, and staying with friends, we hope to keep those travel costs low. (Know someone in the area who'd like us to stay with them? Let us know here!)
 
Everyone loves a perk. We want to keep the photo book as accessible as possible, so a digital version is available at the $25 tier. The postcards will be purchased in towns along the way, and are sure to reflect the local flavor - we can't wait to share those gems with you!
Okay, let's put it all on the table: If we don't reach our goal, we will still make this trip, but may have to shorten the overall duration and skip some locations (Boo!). Regardless, our focus is on creating the highest-quality photo book in the end, no matter what!

developed the Winchcombe Burger Company.</p>
<p>It all started twelve months ago when some friends came
around for a BBQ and were served burgers made in the kitchen at home. All of
the friends liked them so much that they asked if they could buy some, and so
the seeds of the Winchcombe Burger Company were sown.</p>
<p>Since then we have developed the concept in to a business
which is very close to going live.</p>
<p>The ethos of the business is not only to provide the customers
with a selection of burgers that they cannot buy elsewhere, but also to support
local farmers, producers and businesses.</p>
<p>Therefore our range of burgers goes beyond the norm to include
meats and flavours that  are not currently available, whilst having full
traceability of where the meat has come from, how the animal has been treated,
and how it will make the humble burger taste better.</p>
<p>As an example the beef we use comes from 28 day aged
Longhorn Cattle which have grazed in the field which we can almost see from the
window of our unit. We then take that meat and turn it in to a burger, not by
using scraps of meat and fillers, but by mincing our own meats with our own mix
of cuts to add texture, taste and flavour.</p>
<p>What also makes our burgers special is the range of meats
and flavours, (all natural), that we use.</p>
<p>There is not sufficient space to detail all of our range but
below is a sample to give you an idea of what we are offering;-</p>
<ul>
<li>Beef
     and Chilli</li>
<li>Beef
     and Horseradish</li>
<li>Lamb
     and Mint</li>
<li>Moroccan
     Lamb</li>
<li>Pork
     and Chorizo</li>
<li>Pork,
     Apple, and Honey</li>
</ul><p>Our full range and more detail on the business can be found on our website <a href=""http://www.thewinchcombeburgercompany.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Winchcombe Burger Company</a></p><p>In addition we will also be developing seasonal burgers,
such as Turkey and Cranberry, to sell at appropriate times of year.</p>
<p>Obviously to make money we need to sell these burgers which we plan to do
initially through farmers markets, food festivals and through our website (see link above) direct to customers, as well as through local farm shops and delicatessens and
to pubs and restaurants both directly and through distribution channels, which
we are currently in the process of agreeing terms with.</p>
<p>We have found a suitable unit to produce the burgers and
have funding in place for the larger assets required such as a van, production
and storage, and display equipment.</p>
<p>However having funded the large equipment we are running out
of our own money to buy the smaller equipment and money to guarantee pitches at
the markets.</p>
<p>We are therefore looking to raise funds through this source
to allow us to buy the smaller items, which individually are reasonably priced
but collectively amount to a larger sum of money.</p><p>The items we need to buy include;-</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Kitchen Tables</li>
<li>Weighing Scales</li>
<li>Till</li>
<li>Labelling System</li>
<li>Gazebo</li>
<li>Induction Hob</li>
<li>Generator</li>
<li>Trailer</li>
<li>Lighting Gantry</li>
</ul><p>We know this equipment list won't cost the full amount of money we are seeking, but there are other costs we need to incur to allow us to move the business forward, including</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Pitch rental costs at festivals</li>
<li>Development of bespoke packaging</li>
<li>Marketing and advertising costs</li>
<li>Website development</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p>
<p>By supporting and investing in us we be able to launch the
business fully at the beginning of June and be up and running in time for the
prime ""burger season"" over the summer months</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><p>It is easy as Directors of the company to get over excited
and over use a well known ""Only Fools and Horses"" quote that ""this
time next year we will be millionaires"".</p>
<p>Whilst that would be nice, the reality is that unless our
numbers come up on the Lottery it is unlikely to happen, however we do believe
that we have a sound business idea and that we have the passion and belief that
it will work, and whilst not making us able to buy a Premiership football team
it will allow us to earn a living.</p>
<p>However we can't do this without support and the money we
are after will allow us to</p>
<ul>
<li>buy
     the small equipment we need to furnish the unit as we need to</li>
<li>pay
     for the pitch rental fees for larger festivals where there is greater
     footfall and increased potential for higher sales</li>
<li>decorate
     and furnish the unit as we need to so that we are fully compliant
     with environmental health officer requirements</li>
<li>implement
     marketing strategies to establish the name of the business and to get it
     out to potential customers</li>
</ul><p>As with all investors a return is required no matter how
large or small the investment is. </p>
<p><b>So what would you get if you were to invest in us?</b></p>
<p>Although we originally thought that a one off voucher to buy
our burgers at a reduced rate sounded like a good idea, on reflection we felt
that it would only be a transaction similar to any other voucher you can buy
from various websites that bombard you with offers.</p>
<p>So we have thought about this differently and what we are
after is investors who want to be our on-going customers and want to benefit
from the development of our business as we ourselves develop.</p>
<p>To achieve this we have set up ""The Well Hung Burger
Club"" membership of which will initially be exclusively only available to
those that have invested in the company through this website and are therefore
fanatical about burgers.</p>
<p>Member benefits will include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>For every year that you are a member you will receive a voucher worth £15 to redeem against our products (which cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or discount)</li>
<li>a
     15% discount on all members orders (excl annual voucher and delivery)</li>
<li>Advance
     notice of which markets and festivals we will be showing at with specific
     promotional discounts only available to Club members</li>
<li>additional
     exclusive promotions through out the year and on launch of new products</li>
<li>VIP
     invites to burger tastings with opportunities to meet the farmers and
     producers</li>
<li>""Club
     Nights"" in local pubs and restaurants where our burgers will be
     cooked and served at preferential rates</li>
<li>Opportunities
     to win free tickets to food festivals where we are selling</li>
<li>Regular
     newsletters with additional offers</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>Your investment will primarily allow us both to sleep at
night, or at least we will be kept awake worrying about more positive things,
like how busy we are going to be the next day!!</p>
<p>Seriously any investment you can make in our business will
allow us to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>We have already generated over 1,200 followers on Twitter,
and that number is going up every day, there are customers out there waiting
for us to launch.</p><p>We have already made contact with food festival organisers and farmers markets and they are keen for us to take a stall at markets and festivals both locally and around the country</p>
<p>We have already turned down a number of opportunities as we
were not ready to provide the standards we demand of ourselves and we didn't
want to compromise on them.</p>
<p>Your money and investment will help us to achieve our aims
and ambitions for this company and we would like you to be a part of it, not
just with your investment but as we move forward and develop and hopefully
deliver our bigger plans over the next two to three years</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p><p>If you are still reading this, then thank you for taking the

initially through farmers markets, food festivals and through our website (see link above) direct to customers, as well as through local farm shops and delicatessens and
to pubs and restaurants both directly and through distribution channels, which
we are currently in the process of agreeing terms with.
We have found a suitable unit to produce the burgers and
have funding in place for the larger assets required such as a van, production
and storage, and display equipment.
However having funded the large equipment we are running out
of our own money to buy the smaller equipment and money to guarantee pitches at
the markets.
We are therefore looking to raise funds through this source
to allow us to buy the smaller items, which individually are reasonably priced
but collectively amount to a larger sum of money.The items we need to buy include;-
Kitchen Tables
Weighing Scales
Till
Labelling System
Gazebo
Induction Hob
Generator
Trailer
Lighting Gantry
We know this equipment list won't cost the full amount of money we are seeking, but there are other costs we need to incur to allow us to move the business forward, including
Pitch rental costs at festivals
Development of bespoke packaging
Marketing and advertising costs
Website development

By supporting and investing in us we be able to launch the
business fully at the beginning of June and be up and running in time for the
prime ""burger season"" over the summer monthsWhat We Need & What You GetIt is easy as Directors of the company to get over excited
and over use a well known ""Only Fools and Horses"" quote that ""this
time next year we will be millionaires"".
Whilst that would be nice, the reality is that unless our
numbers come up on the Lottery it is unlikely to happen, however we do believe
that we have a sound business idea and that we have the passion and belief that
it will work, and whilst not making us able to buy a Premiership football team
it will allow us to earn a living.
However we can't do this without support and the money we
are after will allow us to

buy
     the small equipment we need to furnish the unit as we need to
pay
     for the pitch rental fees for larger festivals where there is greater
     footfall and increased potential for higher sales
decorate
     and furnish the unit as we need to so that we are fully compliant
     with environmental health officer requirements
implement
     marketing strategies to establish the name of the business and to get it
     out to potential customers
As with all investors a return is required no matter how
large or small the investment is. 
So what would you get if you were to invest in us?
Although we originally thought that a one off voucher to buy
our burgers at a reduced rate sounded like a good idea, on reflection we felt
that it would only be a transaction similar to any other voucher you can buy
from various websites that bombard you with offers.
So we have thought about this differently and what we are
after is investors who want to be our on-going customers and want to benefit
from the development of our business as we ourselves develop.
To achieve this we have set up ""The Well Hung Burger
Club"" membership of which will initially be exclusively only available to
those that have invested in the company through this website and are therefore
fanatical about burgers.
Member benefits will include:-

For every year that you are a member you will receive a voucher worth £15 to redeem against our products (which cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or discount)
a
     15% discount on all members orders (excl annual voucher and delivery)
Advance
     notice of which markets and festivals we will be showing at with specific
     promotional discounts only available to Club members
additional
     exclusive promotions through out the year and on launch of new products
VIP
     invites to burger tastings with opportunities to meet the farmers and
     producers
""Club
     Nights"" in local pubs and restaurants where our burgers will be
     cooked and served at preferential rates
Opportunities
     to win free tickets to food festivals where we are selling
Regular
     newsletters with additional offers
The ImpactYour investment will primarily allow us both to sleep at
night, or at least we will be kept awake worrying about more positive things,
like how busy we are going to be the next day!!
Seriously any investment you can make in our business will
allow us to hit the ground running.
We have already generated over 1,200 followers on Twitter,
and that number is going up every day, there are customers out there waiting
for us to launch.We have already made contact with food festival organisers and farmers markets and they are keen for us to take a stall at markets and festivals both locally and around the country
We have already turned down a number of opportunities as we
were not ready to provide the standards we demand of ourselves and we didn't
want to compromise on them.
Your money and investment will help us to achieve our aims
and ambitions for this company and we would like you to be a part of it, not
just with your investment but as we move forward and develop and hopefully
deliver our bigger plans over the next two to three yearsOther Ways You Can HelpIf you are still reading this, then thank you for taking the
time to understand what the Winchcombe Burger Company is all about.
If this company is not for you then good luck and I hope you
find a company you would like to invest in soon, however if you know someone

that they can read what we are all about and hopefully become a member of

<h2>My background is in books — 30+ years'-worth of it.</h2>
<p>I've worked in the publishing business for over 30 years now, both in the production end of matters for major publishers on both coasts of the US (I still keep my hand in, in fact), and as a bookseller. My bookselling days go back to managing stores for Lauriats in the Boston, MA, area in the mid-1980s, and later on the North Shore of Boston in the later '80s. I love selling books, love talking to customers, love ""hand-selling.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>I studied Children's Literature at Simmons College as part of their Master's program after my BA in the mid-1980s, and my specialty while working as a copy editor, proofreader, and developmental editor for publishers has been science fiction and fantasy.</p>
<p>Hence the specialty for Star Cat Books: gently used and new books, specializing in science fiction and children's books.</p>
<h4>Online Presence</h4>
<p>I have a background in creating websites &amp; integrating POS systems into them via databases, so we can modernize the existing bookstore inventory, including our new acquisitions of course, to allow our customers to finally be able to buy directly from Star Cat Books on the web as well as through programs such as Abe/Amazon Books.</p>
<h4>Ebooks: Friend or Foe?</h4>
<p>I know from ebooks — I've had to as ebooks have evolved over the last decade — and was one of the earliest adopters (I freely admit my complete and utter geekdom in having a Newton Message Pad and using it to read books...). We plan to participate in the indie bookstore platform with Kodo to provide our customers with a viable way to acquire and purchase ebooks both through us and at home.</p>
<p>While distribution systems for publishers have changed radically over the last few years, creating a ""the sky is falling"" attitude in the media, those of us in the business for this long know that smaller bookstores themselves are not all going the way of the dinosaur. Why? Because indies have known all along that one must change constantly, keep with the flow. And to <i>keep it local.</i></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Supporting Locally</p>
<p>In keeping with our promise to uphold our ""stay local"" creed, we will be supporting local authors (of which there are many! did you know that the award-winning author of 1940's ""shocker"" <i>The Lost Weekend </i>lived right in this valley?) We will be supporting and coordinating with local stores and merchants (I've already joined the Bradford Merchants' Association as of this morning — we even meet at the locally owned coffee house, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Local-Buzz/258082966873"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Local Buzz</a>), and we will be commissioning in as many local artisans' crafts to support the bookstore as possible.</p>
<p>Bradford, VT, supports a vibrant community of merchants, including an old-fashioned 5¢ &amp; 10¢ store (Hills), one of the best local restaurants &amp; its lounge which is open late (right across the street from what will be my bookstore's location), a coffee shop, pizza joint, general store and hangout, ice cream (did you know New England sells, per capita, more ice cream than any other US region? go figure!), and it even hosts the home of Copeland Furniture — which makes furniture (the factory and factory store is in town) for The Company Store, featuring designs such as Frank Lloyd Wright's chairs and tables.</p>

So we could give you a big hug to thank you for just reading this. But especially because we think you'd love to see the Upper Valley and Bradford, Vermont, in particular. And, of course, Star Cat Books when it moves into the bookstore space in downtown Bradford.
Spring, summer, fall, winter — every season is lovely here. I'm not just making that up. I'll be posting updates here with photos of weird and wonderful things you can see if you do end up visiting this area (and fun to see and read about even if you do never make it here).

</span></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The initial idea:</b><br/></p>
<p>
Since August 2012 Sarah and Dennis organize vegan events at their home once a month where
friends can come over to eat Sarah's selfmade vegan cakes, cookies, cupcakes, muffins, coffee and
so forth. The experience they gathered from that made them want
to open a real coffee house even more.</p>
<p>But it should not
stay a simple place to eat and drink coffee. Sarah and Dennis’ vision is to organize
small concerts, readings, art exhibitions, maybe some stand up comedy, board
game evenings and other cultural events.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>About Sarah and Dennis:</b><br/>Sarah and Dennis are a vegan couple from Duisburg, Germany. Dennis is a drummer, author and game designer, Sarah is a freelance baker. Together they have the vision of opening a vegan coffee house in their hometown Duisburg.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p><p></p>
<p><b>What they need from
you: <br/></b>
They already found a place which is being refurbished right now. After that
they need to decorate the guest area, set up the kitchen with
professional kitchen tools and buy a really good but expensive coffee machine. </p>
<p>For that they need the
help from as many people as possible. </p>
<p><b><span><br/></span>What YOU get from
that:<br/></b>
The perks that come with supporting this campaign are really something. From
discount on all products over a free cake, a limited supporter t-shirt up to a
baking session with head chef Sarah or even a complete and private dinner for
four people with live music and you name it. There’s something for everybody. And
every buck counts. Even if you’re from a different country you can help this
couple make their dream come true and to make their city a little bit more
vegan. </p>

Torten, Eintöpfe, Aufläufe und alles was sonst noch schmeckt. Sarah wird in der
Krümelküche die Küchenchefin sein und darf dann endlich mit vollem Eifer ihre
Liebe zum Kochen und Backen ausleben.
Einige von Euch haben sicherlich schon die
ein oder andere leckere Kostprobe von Sarah in unserem Guerilla-Café probieren
dürfen. Damit haben wir seit anderthalb Jahren Erfahrungen sammeln
können: https://www.facebook.com/cafemousebear
Was wir schon haben: Wir haben ein sehr gut ausgearbeitetes Konzept in Form von einem Businessplan und ein wunderschönes Ladenlokal. Dieses wird momentan komplett umgebaut und soweit fertiggestellt, dass wir uns nur noch um die Wandgestaltung, den Fußboden und natürlich die Einrichtung kümmern müssen. Für das Interieur haben wir im Laufe der Zeit bereits einige Möbel angesammelt, die alle einen schönen Platz im Café bekommen sollen. Außerdem lassen wir ein paar lokale Künstler und Designer auf unsere Wände los, um sie individuell und geschmackvoll zu gestalten. Was wir noch brauchen: Für die Austattung und die Renovierungsarbeiten im Café benötigen wir eine Summe von 20.000€. Diese Summe benötigen wir für die Renovierung und die gesamte Aussttattung der Küche. Das beinhaltet sowohl die technischen Geräte als auch die Küche selber. Neben einem Kühlschrank, einem Ofen bzw. Herd und einer Gastronomiespülmaschine benötigen wir außerdem diverse Küchenmöbel. Hinzu kommen die Kleingeräte und Arbeitsmaterialien wie Töpfe, Pfannen und Werkzeuge. Für den Gästebereich benötigen wir eine Kuchentheke, einen Getränkekühlschrank und das Herzstück eines jeden Cafés: Die Kaffee- und Espressomaschine sowie die dazugehörigen Kaffeemühlen. Was IHR davon habt: BAM! Ihr bekommt also ein neues veganes Lieblingscafé, in dem ganz viel Herzblut steckt und wo Ihr Bücher lesend oder Spiele spielend schlemmen und entspannen könnt. Außerdem stehen Euch einige tolle Perks als Belohnung für Eure Spende zur Verfügung. Awesome!Neben leckeren Cupcakes und Torten könnt ihr auch Jutebeutel oder T-Shirts bekommen. Yippee-Ki-Yay! Zudem gibt es Backkurse bei Sarah oder gar die Benennung eines Sandwiches oder Mittagsgerichts nach Euch. Legendary! Und das sind nur einige der Perks, die zur Verfügung stehen. Schaut Euch um. Es ist sicherlich für jeden etwas dabei. Spenden könnt ihr für die Perks mit Kreditkarte oder bequem per PayPal.Außerdem werden wir in unserem Ladenlokal eine Dankestafel aufhängen, auf der wir unsere Unterstützer und Helfer namentlich nennen, sodass wir und andere jeden Tag sehen können, wer uns geholfen hat, unseren Traum zu erfüllen.Was ihr sonst tun könnt: Wir sind für jeden Betrag, den Ihr spenden könnt dankbar. So kommen wir unserem Ziel immer näher. Und auch wenn Ihr nicht spenden könnt: wenn Ihr allen von der Kampagne erzählt, erreichen wir bestimmt genug Leute, die etwas spenden möchten. Also freuen wir uns auch, wenn Ihr die Kampagne fleißig in allen sozialen Netzen teilt und Euren Freunden und Familien davon erzählt.So oder so danken wir Euch 1000fach für Eure Hilfe und Unterstützung!_________________________________________________________________ENGLISH SUMMARY
The initial idea:

Since August 2012 Sarah and Dennis organize vegan events at their home once a month where
friends can come over to eat Sarah's selfmade vegan cakes, cookies, cupcakes, muffins, coffee and
so forth. The experience they gathered from that made them want
to open a real coffee house even more.
But it should not
stay a simple place to eat and drink coffee. Sarah and Dennis’ vision is to organize
small concerts, readings, art exhibitions, maybe some stand up comedy, board
game evenings and other cultural events. 

About Sarah and Dennis:Sarah and Dennis are a vegan couple from Duisburg, Germany. Dennis is a drummer, author and game designer, Sarah is a freelance baker. Together they have the vision of opening a vegan coffee house in their hometown Duisburg.
What they need from
you: 
They already found a place which is being refurbished right now. After that
they need to decorate the guest area, set up the kitchen with
professional kitchen tools and buy a really good but expensive coffee machine. 
For that they need the
help from as many people as possible. 
What YOU get from
that:
The perks that come with supporting this campaign are really something. From
discount on all products over a free cake, a limited supporter t-shirt up to a
baking session with head chef Sarah or even a complete and private dinner for
four people with live music and you name it. There’s something for everybody. And
every buck counts. Even if you’re from a different country you can help this
couple make their dream come true and to make their city a little bit more

<h3>What do we need money for?</h3>
<p>The party in 2013 will be just as fantastic even if no one contributes a dime here, and to tell the truth, $500 was the minimum ammount that we could ask for via IndieGoGo, and we'll do fine on a lot less (we can keep the money, even if we don't make the full goal here).</p>

<p>Regardless of how much y'all kick in, me and the rest of the Community will certainly have a bunch of liquor, some decent wine, a big pot of wassail and some tasty food. But of course if had $500 to spend we could really have some nice things! Maybe a gigantic King Cake this year?</p>

<p>Preservation Kentucky is working with Bethlehem High School (BHS), an independent Catholic school, in Bardstown to save the endangered Anatok house from demolition.  Anatok is an antebellum mansion, built by Catholic merchant Charles Hayden in 1847, known for its most famous resident—Black Catholic activist Daniel Rudd.  Born into slavery on this site in 1854, Daniel Rudd went on to found the National Black Catholic Congress and established the American Catholic Tribune—“the only Catholic Journal owned and published by colored men.” Rudd is the subject of a new book on his life by Professor Gary Agee titled, “A Cry for Justice: Daniel Rudd and His Life in Black Catholicism, Journalism, and Activism, 1854-1933.”   If preserved, this historic site would be the only site directly associated with the rise of Black Catholicism in Bardstown—known as the cradle of Catholicism on the Western Frontier in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Preservation Kentucky (PK) has teamed up with the Kentucky Trust for Historic Preservation and local groups to help BHS save Anatok and incorporate it into their campus as a center for fine arts.  This partnership has resulted in a plan with BHS to use the house as classrooms for their flourishing visual arts program and an enhanced choral program. For more information on Bethlehem High School please visit: <a href=""http://www.bethlehemhigh.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bethlehemhigh.org/</a></p>
<p>However, BHS cannot afford to preserve Anatok from their general revenues.  So, PK has offered to help them plan and fundraise to convert Anatok into fine arts classroom space, while preserving its historic character.  PK has consulted with architects, contractors, and roofers and developed an initial renovation cost of $500,000.  If we cannot meet this goal by April 30, Anatok—an important piece of Black Catholic history—will be demolished.</p>

<strong>How did tHe HanG OuT get started</strong>?</h2>
<p>The Hang Out started a couple of years ago as a family night at the Richardson’s home. Family, friends, and neighborhood kids would participate in playing video games. It began with Wii Sports then moved over to the Xbox 360 Kinect. After talking to parents in the neighborhood and through word of mouth, “The Hangout” rapidly grew. We now have as many as twenty-five kids along with parents participating and the numbers keeps growing! As the numbers increase we realized the demand for snacks was great so we began buying snacks such as cookies, popcorn, and hot dogs, just to name a few. We couldn’t keep enough water in the refrigerator for all the thirsty kids so we invested in a water cooler. Even though all of snacks and everything were out of our own pockets, we loved doing it! Some of the children wanted to watch movies on Friday nights as well, which is also a Richardson tradition. Now our Friday nights alternate between games and movies. The Hang Out is a place where kids can be kids while having fun and spending time with their family and friends. We are in need of donations and a larger place on the Southwest side of Houston, Texas. Once in our new place we will also start our after school programs as well as our kids TV show where the kids run the show!</p>
<h2><strong>wHAt wE nEEd at The hAnG oUT</strong></h2>
<p>We are in need of a commercial building in the Southwest Houston area. Our home has become overwhelmed with kids and parents and we cannot accommodate everyone at the same time. We also need a van for picking up and taking home kids that want to come. Some live as far as 40+ miles away.  In the building we will need a Big Screen TV, Xbox 360 Kinect, and a Blue ray Player with a Sound system for our  Game and Movie nights. We Need Computers for the after school programs. Food and snack donations must be sealed and store bought for the safety of the kids. Last but not least, cash donations are always welcome to help cut cost.</p>

<p>The four Pathfinders will have a big impact on the areas that they are working in. Also, they are the pilot program for the <strong>Humanist Services Corps</strong> which will  eventually become the largest volunteer services organization for secular humanists.

</div></div>","This year Foundation Beyond Belief (FBB) is sponsoring the Pathfinders Project, a year-long volunteer journey, taking four humanist volunteers across the world to work in education, clean water, human rights and construction projects, and to evaluate programs for inclusion in a future Humanist Service Corps (HSC). The HSC will be a proud moment for all nonbelievers. Like the Peace Corps, the HSC will serve their fellowman in the cause of peace by living and working in developing countries, but with more focus on encouraging and demonstrating the generosity and compassion of secular humanists.
Since FBB's launched in 2010, we have raised over $400,000 to fight blood cancers through the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. We have raised close to a million in just three years to help other charities in the name of humanism.

<p>Wyatt’s family had a great birthday party on October 27 to celebrate him<br/>turning 4 years old on October 29! There were lots of family and friends<br/>there, great food and cake (thanks to everyone for their help!) and some<br/>awesome birthday gifts for Wyatt (as well as some great little-brother gifts<br/>for Ryder!).</p>
<p>Wyatt had spent most of the week leading up to his party in the hospital<br/>again. He developed another bladder infection, and had some problems<br/>with his chemo port site. So they cultured his urine, which took a few days<br/>to grow out, and had to sedate him in order to insert a new line for delivery<br/>of his morphine and the new antibiotics for infection. He also received<br/>another chemo treatment. Luckily, they were able to discharge him on<br/>Friday, and we were all very happy that he felt up to attending his birthday<br/>party on Saturday. He seemed to enjoy it quite a bit, though you could tell<br/>he certainly wasn’t feeling like his old self. He had to wear a mask during<br/>the entire event to protect him from germs, since his immune system is so<br/>compromised. But boy, what a trooper he is - he never complained about<br/>that once!</p>
<p>Wyatt is scheduled to have an MRI on Monday, October 29 (his actual<br/>birthday), to assess his current condition in regards to spread of the<br/>disease. We are all hoping for good news! Then, he is scheduled to have<br/>surgery on Friday, Nov. 2 to have his bladder and prostate removed. It will<br/>be a lengthy surgery, estimated by his urologist to last appx. 8 hours.</p>
<p>Let's keep positive thoughts flowing Wyatt's way - we will post updates as<br/>we get them!</p>
<p>Wyatt's family thanks everyone for all of the support!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Update #3 - Wyatt Update - 10/12/12</h2>
<p>Wyatt has been admitted to Detroit Children’s Hospital for his next round of<br/>chemotherapy treatment. He will receive chemotherapy everyday for 5 days, go home for 2 days, and then be re-admitted for another round of 5 day treatment. The plan right now is that he’ll then have an MRI to see if any tumor shrinkage has occurred, and to access whether there has been any spread of the tumor through the bladder wall, sphincter muscle or any other organs. He is scheduled for surgery to remove the bladder and prostate (and possibly the sphincter muscle) on November 2. Amount of spread of the disease will determine whether the doctors will plan on using radiation as part of his treatment. That will consist of either traditional radiation (beam) or the implantation of radiation seeds.</p>
<p>Wyatt is now back on antibiotics again ... The same IV one he was on at home at least for another 24 hours till we find out which one will treat this new infection. Urology should see him in the morning to talk about what the options are for dealing with his catheter.</p>
<p>Wyatt and his mom, Ashley, would like to send a HUGE thank you to everyone, for your thoughts, prayers, and donations. They are so grateful to know that so many people care and are offering so many types of assistance to their family!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Update #2 - Wyatt Update - 10/5/12</h2>
<p><span>He is now into his third week of Chemo. He is still doing well with the Chemo part that is. The cathiter part we are still having issues with. His hair is falling out in clumps now and just any time he moves it comes out. The plan was to shave his head yesterday but he was in severe pain and well, will shave it over the weekend...when Ryder comes home so I can shave both their heads</span>!! His Pah came to spend time with him and that really lifts his spirits. He was even excited about riding in Pahs truck :) After irrigating the cath last night he has been much better today, its actually draining and he's eating, drinking and playing. Next Wednesday will be the day I learn what the plan will be with surgery and radiation. He has received many cards, gifts and other things and we will be working on thank you cards during this upcoming week long hospital stay.</p>
<h2>Update #1:  Wyatt Update - 10/3/12</h2>
<p>He is still pretty angry about all thats going on. He's just not a happy camper. We are home though. We got to leave around 9 last night. The infection he has can't be cured by oral antibiotics so he came home with his port accessed and the visiting nurse should be here soon with the equipment and meds. The news that I have to share next was hard to take in...they did another ultrasound on his bladder and since the tumor has taken over all the way up to the kidney tubes now ( and a good chance into the muscle wall ) Wyatt will have to hold off on radiation and will be having his bladder and prostate removed completely. It's a very serious surgery, will take 6+ hours and then he will have a urostomy bag for 3 years while they clear the rest of the cancer. They will then make him a new bladder and hope everything works the way it should. If not, he will have a cath the rest of his life...we will know more next Wednesday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to come to my cause.  My name is Justin Anzalone and I am raising money on behalf of my four year old second cousin, Wyatt, who was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma on September 6th, 2012 while in the hospital for a routine bladder operation.  His mother, my cousin Ashley, is a divorced mother of two.  </p>
<p>We are attempting to raise $1000 to help cover the cost of travel and childcare for my cousin Ashley.  Each trip to the hospital for chemotherapy is a 4 hour round trip.  </p>
<p>Wyatt’s little brother, Ryder, is currently staying with his great-grandmother<br/>and grandfather at their home in Charlevoix, since there is no one able to<br/>care for him nearby for days and nights at a time.</p>
<p>Wyatt’s and Ryder’s grandmother is dealing with her own medical issue,<br/>which is preventing her from being with Ashley and the boy’s (as well as<br/>her job).</p>
<p>Any and all funds that we raise will be going directly to my cousin Ashley to assist her financially (<span>e.g. hospital bills and travel expenses)</span></p>
<p>I recognize that without your contributions, providing the assistance that my family so desparately needs would be impossible, so we would like to recognize your contribution with perks!  They include:</p>
<p>Level I - A personal thank you card from Wyatt.</p>
<p>Level II -  The perks listed under Level I as well as a Team Wyatt T-shirt, to be debuted shortly.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, we encourage you to cross-post this across various social media platforms.  We want to raise awareness of childhood cancer and its devastating effect on families.  There are share tools on this site that are conveniently placed for quick and easy distribution.</p>

The news that I have to share next was hard to take in...they did another ultrasound on his bladder and since the tumor has taken over all the way up to the kidney tubes now ( and a good chance into the muscle wall ) Wyatt will have to hold off on radiation and will be having his bladder and prostate removed completely. It's a very serious surgery, will take 6+ hours and then he will have a urostomy bag for 3 years while they clear the rest of the cancer. They will then make him a new bladder and hope everything works the way it should. If not, he will have a cath the rest of his life...we will know more next Wednesday.
 
Hello, and thank you for taking the time to come to my cause.  My name is Justin Anzalone and I am raising money on behalf of my four year old second cousin, Wyatt, who was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma on September 6th, 2012 while in the hospital for a routine bladder operation.  His mother, my cousin Ashley, is a divorced mother of two.  
We are attempting to raise $1000 to help cover the cost of travel and childcare for my cousin Ashley.  Each trip to the hospital for chemotherapy is a 4 hour round trip.  
Wyatt’s little brother, Ryder, is currently staying with his great-grandmotherand grandfather at their home in Charlevoix, since there is no one able tocare for him nearby for days and nights at a time.
Wyatt’s and Ryder’s grandmother is dealing with her own medical issue,which is preventing her from being with Ashley and the boy’s (as well asher job).
Any and all funds that we raise will be going directly to my cousin Ashley to assist her financially (e.g. hospital bills and travel expenses)
I recognize that without your contributions, providing the assistance that my family so desparately needs would be impossible, so we would like to recognize your contribution with perks!  They include:
Level I - A personal thank you card from Wyatt.
Level II -  The perks listed under Level I as well as a Team Wyatt T-shirt, to be debuted shortly.
If you are unable to contribute financially, we encourage you to cross-post this across various social media platforms.  We want to raise awareness of childhood cancer and its devastating effect on families.  There are share tools on this site that are conveniently placed for quick and easy distribution.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>For 10 years Casa Hogar Hijos de la Luna, Oaxaca, MX, has given a safe home to children of single mothers who work at night. Many are sex workers. Now Casa Hogar finds themselves with 53 children in a 3 bedroom space. This project is raising funds so that Casa Hogar may purchase the adjoining land to build a new building so they may continue to serve these kids. This cause is urgent. Without more space the older kids must return to homes - sometimes place such as brothels or stripclubs which are completely inappropriate for adolescents. With more space, Casa Hogar could provide these children with safety, education, nutrition, love and support until their independence!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently, the owner of the land next door which Casa Hogar would like to purchase is in a hurry to sell. If we can come up with the asking price of $46,478 US before September 15th, she will give us a 20% discount, lowering the price about $9,300 US. We have already spent the past year raising funds, however, $24,000 US is still missing. If we can raise this money within the next month, Casa Hogar will finally be able to purchase this land, expand the project and offer their children a home until their adulthood!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we can keep pushing for the 10% discount the owner of the land has offered us if we raise the funds before October 15. This would save us $4,650 US. If the goal in October is not reached, we will continue to fundraise to the best of our abilities until we are able to pay the full price! As long as no one else offers to purchase the land, that is.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Casa Hogar, Hijos de la Luna, Oaxaca, Mexico, was founded 9 years ago by Maria de Socorro Ramirez Gonzalez, in response to an endemic crisis she found in her community.  Maria discovered numerous children were being left unattended in their homes through the night because their single mothers worked (many in the sexual service industry) and were unable to care for them.  Maria opened her home at that time to one child.  Now, 10 years later, after much development as a community resource, Maria and her husband find themselves caring for 55 children in three bedrooms.  The children range in age from infancy to 13 years.  They sleep 2-3 to a twin sized bed or crib.  They desperately need to construct more space to continue serving these children.  If they are unable to expand, the older children must return to their homes.  Many of these homes are places where their mothers work which are not healthy environments for their physical or psychological development.</p>
<p>It is impossible to measure the impact of saving a child from an environment inadequate for their healthy development.  The impact is not only for them but also their families and the community in which they live.  By allowing the children to remain at Casa Hogar, they will be assured of a safe environment, adequate nutrition, and education through their high school years.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please make use of the Indiegogo share tools to help us spread the word! Helping Expand Casa Hogar gain an audience is unimaginably valuable. Help allow these children to grow up in a safe, healthy and supportive living environment! Please share our project on Facebook, in emails or by word-of-mouth!</p>

<p>Memento Studio is a family run Photographic Studio based in Walton on Thames, Surrey, England.</p>
<p>Driven by a passion for photography and filmmaking we used all the capital we had and some we didn’t! and opened our Studio in March 2011.</p>
<p>We wanted to offer local photographers and filmmakers an affordable alternative to the overpriced London studios, which so many of them were forced to use.</p>
<p>Through offering free use of our equipment, keeping our prices low, holding regular affordable workshops and classes we have quickly become a hub for local photographers and creative types and it is this that we want desperately to expand on. Unfortunately we lack the capital we need to really expand, upgrade, (the majority of our equipment was donated and is a little old!) and keep up with what is being requested from us.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $4,500 (approx £2,700) to upgrade and expand our existing Photographic Studio. The funds raised would be spread out over a number of necessary items and renovation costs, such as new Studio lighting kit and accessories, installation of a deeper fixed white infinity cove as well as an additional backdrop support system and backdrops. We would also like to upgrade our Kitchen and Lounge areas and install improved toilet facilities.</p>
<p>Not only would these improvements better service the needs of the photographers and filmmakers who already use our studio, but it would also allow us to subsidise workshops and classes for young photographers and filmmakers just starting out.</p>
<p>The campaign, if successful, will help us launch our upgrade process and allow us to purchase new equipment, benefiting everyone that shoots there as well as the next generation of photographers and filmmakers.</p>
<p>We know this won't happen overnight, but it will allow us the chance to take the next step towards what we've been dreaming about and contributing to our community.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>We completely understand if you cannot contribute financially, we could still do with your support though by sharing this campaign with as many of your friends and family as is humanly possible! The more people we can reach, the more we can raise!</p>

Driven by a passion for photography and filmmaking we used all the capital we had and some we didn’t! and opened our Studio in March 2011.
We wanted to offer local photographers and filmmakers an affordable alternative to the overpriced London studios, which so many of them were forced to use.

<h2>Isn't it Shocking...</h2>
<p><strong>Many of the over 600,000 children in foster care in the U.S. face very grim odds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>40% of foster youth are moved 3 or more times, </strong><strong>11% are moved 5 times or more</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>40% to 50% will never complete high school</strong></li>
<li><strong>only 6% of foster youth attend college</strong></li>
<li><strong>65% of foster youth end up homeless (27% of the homeless population spent time in foster care)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Over 70% of all state penitentiary inmates have spent time in foster care</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Here's the Scoop</h3>
<p>Working in a system that's bursting at the seams, caregivers and other foster care stakeholders struggle to meet the needs of these children, and keeping up with the necessary paperwork is practically impossible. As children are moved from placement to placement, their records often become fragmented or are lost. Can you imagine life without your memory boxes, scrapbooks, awards, report cards and health information? Youth in foster care don't have any of this information.</p>
<p>Because they don't have adequate health and education records, they don't get proper medical care and face significant challenges to positive educational experiences. To make matters worse, they often age out of the foster care system feeling no sense of identity and having no foundation to build a future upon.</p>
<p>We are a team of parents from <a href=""http://www.aboutone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""AboutOne.com"">AboutOne.com</a>, a cloud and mobile technology startup that helps people store, manage, and privately share memories and household records (health, education, possessions, career).</p>
<p>We are building a Communication Station to organize and manage the vitally important information needed by children in foster care. 80% of the development is already done because we are modifying the existing AboutOne consumer platform.

<h3>How the Communication Station Will Help</h3>

<p> </p>
<p>When these children age out of the foster care system at age 18, their Communication Stations will be turned over to them, ensuring that they will have lifetime access to the vital information they'll need to complete job or college applications and manage their health.</p>

<p><strong>Chess &amp; Community Counseling</strong></p>
<p>Chess &amp; Community Counseling (CCC) empowers students between the ages of 8 and 17 with critical thinking techniques that can be utilized and applied to their daily lives. Our individual and group workshops implement our motto, <em>Think before you Move</em>, to encourage students to evaluate their circumstances and plan steps to overcome them. CCC uses chess as a therapeutic model, and creative expression as a tool for empowering youth. </p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to bring ""Classic City Knights,"" a youth chess team from Athens, Georgia, to compete at the annual <em>Bum Rush the Board</em> chess tournament in Washington, D.C. (<a href=""http://www.wblinc.org/bumrush/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wblinc.org/bumrush/</a>). Many of the students have never journeyed outside of their towns or the state of Georgia. This annual trip to Washington, D.C., will be a life changing, eye opening and educational experience for them.  Not only will they compete in the chess tournament, but they will also get an opportunity to tour the Nation’s Capital and learn how policies drawn from the White House trickle down to affect their local communities. Many will learn that the world is bigger than their crime-ridden neighborhoods, and will get the opportunity to meet other youth from around the country to share in solutions for empowerment. </p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>On April 12 -14, 2013, we will bring 15-20 middle and high school students from Athens, Georgia, to Washington, D.C., for an annual chess tournament and touring of the Nation’s Capital.  The students will be chaperoned by three adolescent development mentors. Your support will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round-trip transportation rental for students and chaperones  </li>
<li>Fuel costs (approximately 1,250 miles) and insurance</li>
<li>Experienced driver</li>
<li>Chaperone stipend for 72 hour supervision</li>
<li>Tournament fees</li>
<li>Hotel and food costs</li>
<li>Team uniforms and journals</li>
<li>Washington, D.C., Tour Guide</li>
</ul>
<p>The students will keep a journal to document their experiences throughout the trip. They will compare and contrast their local community/neighborhoods with that of Washington, D.C. Students will also write an essay expressing how this experience changed or shaped their view of self and the United States.  </p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our maximum goal, we will reduce the number of students that we can bring on this trip and limit other spending costs. The vision of the trip is determined by what we are able to raise.  We have already begun local campaigning in hopes of covering expenses not mentioned in the budget.    </p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We at CCC are extremely proud of our students. They have and continue to overcome many obstacles placed before them.  Despite the difficulties they face daily, many of them maintain a positive outlook and attitude on life.  For some, chess has become the model for planning their lives, and for others, playing chess helps them escape the cycle of poverty they are attempting to break. It is way too easy for them to slip into the hardships of street life, and we’ve managed to keep them focused on their personal goals and engage them through various community projects/programs and events such as this annual trip to Washington, D.C. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/14510_552117984802471_372323767_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Students are also impacted with visits to college campuses and parks to play chess with the homeless and learn valuable lessons about life. The overall mission is to prepare them and remind them that they too have a role in positively impacting this society. Chess is the vehicle used to transport and translate this message.</p>

<strong>FUN FACT:</strong> </h2>
<p>Shower Curtain Bling was invented with a ""splash."" I'm the kind of person who is constantly thinking of new ideas and designs. Whenever I get a free moment, my mind takes me away to imagine all the possible things left to create. One such moment -- I'm not embarrassed to say now, since it gave birth to Shower Curtain Bling -- happened on my way to visit the ""privy"" (classy way of saying toilet).</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/413/006/b1b01a41eeb535f2f688b956f131c090_large.jpg?1362059736"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>I was trying to decide what I could do with a few beaded fringe strands I had remaining from a lamp I had just finished designing. I brought the strands with me on my visit to see ""Lou"" and just as I lifted his lid, a twinkle struck my eye. I was suddenly taken aback by how much the florescent light glistened off of the breaded fringe. I held the beads up higher, until the background came into focus and I noticed how good they looked set against my shower curtain. </p>
<p>When inspiration strikes, you just have to go with it,  so I stood on the side of my tub to see how I could attach them.

FUN FACT: 
Shower Curtain Bling was invented with a ""splash."" I'm the kind of person who is constantly thinking of new ideas and designs. Whenever I get a free moment, my mind takes me away to imagine all the possible things left to create. One such moment -- I'm not embarrassed to say now, since it gave birth to Shower Curtain Bling -- happened on my way to visit the ""privy"" (classy way of saying toilet).

I was trying to decide what I could do with a few beaded fringe strands I had remaining from a lamp I had just finished designing. I brought the strands with me on my visit to see ""Lou"" and just as I lifted his lid, a twinkle struck my eye. I was suddenly taken aback by how much the florescent light glistened off of the breaded fringe. I held the beads up higher, until the background came into focus and I noticed how good they looked set against my shower curtain. 
When inspiration strikes, you just have to go with it,  so I stood on the side of my tub to see how I could attach them. But my clumsy nature won out again, as I lost my balance and started careening towards the floor. I grabbed onto my shower curtain for support, but it quickly gave way as unforgiving gravity sent me and the shower curtain heading straight down. I pushed my foot out to brace the fall, but the toilet seat was already opened, so all five of my piggies went for a swim. 
My husband walked in after hearing the commotion, only to discover me standing there holding a curtain rod in one hand while my right leg rested ankle-deep in the toilet-bowl. 
""I'm not sure you're doing that right,"" is all he said to me. 
One broken shower curtain rod and a damp foot later, and Shower Curtain Bling was born.

Do you remember a service with an abundant number of movies that you could choose from and still wouldn't be ripped off?

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">My name is <strong>Talib Habib</strong>. I am 19 Years old and I am full-time college student. Born in Pakistan but raised in Sacramento, California. I quickly picked up the English language and the American culture after moving to America when I was 7 years old. I am still being educated in America, I have made friends here, I have gotten all my opportunities here, and I will have my success here.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">After getting my first computer in the summer of 2008, I became addicted to entertainment. It opened up another medium for me to learn from. I quickly grew into becoming a visual learner and could retain information much faster. That love of entertainment grew every year and so did my knowledge. When I needed more content to watch, I was at a dead end. There was no service out there that could cater to a person like me who was in love with entertainment. In the spring of 2011, I couldn’t find a legitimate service, so I asked my best friend Chris to see if he wanted to start one. And here we are…</p>
<h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">My name is <strong>Christopher Todorvitch</strong>. I am also 19 years old and attending college. I was born and raised Sacramento, California. I have been an entertainment fanatic since I was young. My specialty was in music and my stage name was ‘YC’ or ‘Young Chris’.  I am at a point in my life that has made me realize and understand that if I apply myself, I can go even further. I am not using my potential at a maximum level and I need to keep pushing for greatness.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I really got interested in movies in spring of 2010 after I kept watching marathons of movies and documentaries. My father works in the movie industry and it’s partly because of him that I became so interested. I started to get involved in learning behind the camera. I enjoyed audio engineering the most because it’s related to my first love: music. As 2011 and 2012 progressed, and the economy fluctuated, we started making strides to jumpstart our company. Due to our crazy school and work schedules, the development of MyCineWeb was always starting and stopping. But finally as things are coming together, we’re starting…and both of us are very excited.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/16bDkSU.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">MyCineWeb is an Online Instant Movie Streaming Service. It’s similar to Netflix in that it provides the same service of online streaming, but different that it’s being developed for people by people who are passionately into movies. This service will also be for occasional movie watchers as it provides a much better and a bigger library than its forebears. As a customer who quit Netflix, it irritated us that we couldn’t find anything that we wanted to watch. Most of my time (90%) would be used to find something interesting to watch and the rest (10%) actually watching it. Many iconic movies that have revolutionized the world aren’t available to watch on Netflix Instant, but mediocre to sub-par ones are. We know it’s not nice to belittle a company that revolutionized the industry, but we really believe that the time has come to have a new and a fresh vision to the industry.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We, Chris and Talib, are two people who are amazed, and addicted to movies. We know what it feels like to be the recipient of an online movie service because we know the pain of not having a great service for movies. But it’s not just the content that irritates us; it’s also how they treat their customers and try to take advantage of them. It is the universal goal of any business to make profits but is it fair to the customers that they are being milked of every hard-earned dollar?  To us, that doesn’t sound right nor fair in which a company earns respect.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">One of the core foundations of MyCineWeb is to not just provide good content but also provide great and amazing customer service. In any facet of life, it is hard to  gain and regain respect. This is especially true in business because the customer might end up switching to another company, or quit using the service altogether. Do you remember Qwikster from Netflix in 2011 that made around 800,000 subscribers quit? Netflix is known for its price increases but it doesn’t necessarily offer too much in return for the customer. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel; we are just making it better.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Bottom Line: We, Chris and Talib, are two individuals who are passionate about movies and entertainment that are developing an Online Instant Movie Streaming Service called MyCineWeb which will offer better content and great customer service than its forebears.</p>

<p>We have completed many of the preliminary tasks to get it up and running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registered under Sacramento County to get our DBA</li>
<li>Got a Logo</li>
<li>Registered under the USPTO for the trademark</li>
<li>Hired and almost paid off Website Designer</li>
<li>Developed the Pages of the FINAL website</li>
<li>Made the Fundraising Campaign</li>
<li>Bought the domain</li>
<li>Created the Landing Page</li>
</ul>
<p>Things we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to test the FINAL website on servers</li>
<li>Maintain Indiegogo Campaign</li>
<li>Acquire movies simultaneously running the fundraising Campaign</li>
<li class=""FreeForm"">Then, it’s SHOWTIME!!!!!!!</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/rln1jEg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our donation goal is $27,000. This is a good, solid amount to get us started. We need to finish paying off our website designer who has done a fantastic job in developing our website. The only thing left on the final website are the final testing on the servers, and the final changes. Then we will be ready to add movies. This money will also help us pay the enormous bills that will come soon for good servers to get amazing speed. We do not want to compromise quality of the service. Other than our website designer and paying the bills on the servers, we need a small portion to help us pay for lodging and gas when we go out to get more movies. This money won’t go to our personal funds, so it will help us increase more content towards the website.</p>
<p>As we progress and when the site picks up, we are going to need far more than $27,000 to run it. So even though we need $27,000 right now, feel more than free to keep on donating, as there are no caps to our perks.</p>
<p>Our perks are very interesting. We wanted to have perks that were very intimate to the project. In every perk, you will get some form of a letter or a human connection to let you know that you too, are part of the service. As the donation amount rises, you can get things like couple of T-shirts, stickers and also choose in what medium you want your human connection to be in. If you are an established/upcoming new business who wants to have your logo on our FRONT PAGE of the website, then there is a perk for that. If you want us to come to you and spend one whole day with you, there is a perk for that. Because you are being so generous, we want to make sure that you are happy with every single donation you make.<br/><br/> With some of the larger donations, we are going to need some of your information. Do not get scared, because you are essentially signing up for a decent sized package to come to your house.</p>
<p>If you do not like what you are receiving for a certain amount of donation and would like something else, or you have any questions about where the money goes or a question about a certain reward, then feel free to email us at: <a href=""mailto:maininformation@mycineweb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">maininformation@mycineweb.com</a>.</p>

<p>How many times have you heard, “There is nothing good to watch on Netflix? How come they can’t add more content? Where are the good movies?” Over and over again, we have heard this sentiment and that it why we are starting up MyCineWeb. Over time, services that offer movies and TV-shows online will be replacing companies like Dish Network and DirecTV. People are dropping their TV subscriptions as a whole and switching over to service like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu to watch their shows and favorite movies. One day, our goal is to be the premier service that people switch to and utilize. </p>
<p>Services like Netflix and Amazon allow you to control what you want to watch, and pay a better rate than services like Dish and DirecTV. So we ask you, why not develop a service that caters to all our needs? Why not support people who want to change the way we watch movies? Why not support people who are passionate about movies because they will care more about the service, and not care about making a quick profit? Lastly, we ask you one last time, “Why not donate to MyCineWeb?”</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/uh8B2Sw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are many ways you can help us reach our goal. Since it’s a combined effort to make this service become a reality, we need your opinion and input on how you would like the service as well. In a perfect world, how can we serve you better? <br/><br/> The biggest way to support us right now is to donate money as well as donate your opinion to us. If you know someone who will like the idea of creating an Online Instant Movie Streaming Service, why don’t you share it with him or her?</p>
<p><br/>Another way to support us is to:</p>

I enjoyed audio engineering the most because it’s related to my first love: music. As 2011 and 2012 progressed, and the economy fluctuated, we started making strides to jumpstart our company. Due to our crazy school and work schedules, the development of MyCineWeb was always starting and stopping. But finally as things are coming together, we’re starting…and both of us are very excited.

MyCineWeb is an Online Instant Movie Streaming Service. It’s similar to Netflix in that it provides the same service of online streaming, but different that it’s being developed for people by people who are passionately into movies. This service will also be for occasional movie watchers as it provides a much better and a bigger library than its forebears. As a customer who quit Netflix, it irritated us that we couldn’t find anything that we wanted to watch. Most of my time (90%) would be used to find something interesting to watch and the rest (10%) actually watching it. Many iconic movies that have revolutionized the world aren’t available to watch on Netflix Instant, but mediocre to sub-par ones are. We know it’s not nice to belittle a company that revolutionized the industry, but we really believe that the time has come to have a new and a fresh vision to the industry.
We, Chris and Talib, are two people who are amazed, and addicted to movies. We know what it feels like to be the recipient of an online movie service because we know the pain of not having a great service for movies. But it’s not just the content that irritates us; it’s also how they treat their customers and try to take advantage of them. It is the universal goal of any business to make profits but is it fair to the customers that they are being milked of every hard-earned dollar?  To us, that doesn’t sound right nor fair in which a company earns respect.
One of the core foundations of MyCineWeb is to not just provide good content but also provide great and amazing customer service. In any facet of life, it is hard to  gain and regain respect. This is especially true in business because the customer might end up switching to another company, or quit using the service altogether. Do you remember Qwikster from Netflix in 2011 that made around 800,000 subscribers quit? Netflix is known for its price increases but it doesn’t necessarily offer too much in return for the customer. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel; we are just making it better.
Bottom Line: We, Chris and Talib, are two individuals who are passionate about movies and entertainment that are developing an Online Instant Movie Streaming Service called MyCineWeb which will offer better content and great customer service than its forebears.

We have completed many of the preliminary tasks to get it up and running:

Registered under Sacramento County to get our DBA
Got a Logo
Registered under the USPTO for the trademark
Hired and almost paid off Website Designer
Developed the Pages of the FINAL website
Made the Fundraising Campaign
Bought the domain
Created the Landing Page

Things we need to do:

Need to test the FINAL website on servers
Maintain Indiegogo Campaign
Acquire movies simultaneously running the fundraising Campaign
Then, it’s SHOWTIME!!!!!!!




Our donation goal is $27,000. This is a good, solid amount to get us started. We need to finish paying off our website designer who has done a fantastic job in developing our website. The only thing left on the final website are the final testing on the servers, and the final changes. Then we will be ready to add movies. This money will also help us pay the enormous bills that will come soon for good servers to get amazing speed. We do not want to compromise quality of the service. Other than our website designer and paying the bills on the servers, we need a small portion to help us pay for lodging and gas when we go out to get more movies. This money won’t go to our personal funds, so it will help us increase more content towards the website.
As we progress and when the site picks up, we are going to need far more than $27,000 to run it. So even though we need $27,000 right now, feel more than free to keep on donating, as there are no caps to our perks.
Our perks are very interesting. We wanted to have perks that were very intimate to the project. In every perk, you will get some form of a letter or a human connection to let you know that you too, are part of the service. As the donation amount rises, you can get things like couple of T-shirts, stickers and also choose in what medium you want your human connection to be in. If you are an established/upcoming new business who wants to have your logo on our FRONT PAGE of the website, then there is a perk for that. If you want us to come to you and spend one whole day with you, there is a perk for that. Because you are being so generous, we want to make sure that you are happy with every single donation you make. With some of the larger donations, we are going to need some of your information. Do not get scared, because you are essentially signing up for a decent sized package to come to your house.
If you do not like what you are receiving for a certain amount of donation and would like something else, or you have any questions about where the money goes or a question about a certain reward, then feel free to email us at: maininformation@mycineweb.com.

How many times have you heard, “There is nothing good to watch on Netflix? How come they can’t add more content? Where are the good movies?” Over and over again, we have heard this sentiment and that it why we are starting up MyCineWeb. Over time, services that offer movies and TV-shows online will be replacing companies like Dish Network and DirecTV. People are dropping their TV subscriptions as a whole and switching over to service like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu to watch their shows and favorite movies. One day, our goal is to be the premier service that people switch to and utilize. 
Services like Netflix and Amazon allow you to control what you want to watch, and pay a better rate than services like Dish and DirecTV. So we ask you, why not develop a service that caters to all our needs? Why not support people who want to change the way we watch movies? Why not support people who are passionate about movies because they will care more about the service, and not care about making a quick profit? Lastly, we ask you one last time, “Why not donate to MyCineWeb?”

There are many ways you can help us reach our goal. Since it’s a combined effort to make this service become a reality, we need your opinion and input on how you would like the service as well. In a perfect world, how can we serve you better?  The biggest way to support us right now is to donate money as well as donate your opinion to us. If you know someone who will like the idea of creating an Online Instant Movie Streaming Service, why don’t you share it with him or her?

name is David, and I lost my father, Bob, to lung cancer in 2007, one
month after his 56th birthday.  My dad was a hard working, good guy that
everyone liked.  He was quiet and reserved, smart and wise... he was also
a smoker.  He was Born in the 50's, and growing up, smokers were cool.
 I remember seeing pictures of him with a cigarette pack rolled up in the
sleeve of his white T-shirt with his Fonze-style hair cut.  But years
later, after fighting with everything he had for 18 months, he lost his battle
with cancer.  It was horrible to watch this strong, proud man, my
Dad, fight with everything he had to stay with us... His wife of 35 years, his
2 boys and our wives and his 5 grand children who he would never see grow up...
or even get to see 2 of them to their 4th Birthday.</p>
<p>My dad told me about a
week before he passed, ""you should quit... you don't want this"". He was right, I didn't want that.  It was terrible and it was hard,
and I <b><i>KNEW </i></b>better.  </p>

years later, I was still smoking up to a pack a day, After watching cancer
slowly kill my dad, after watching my mother-in-law deal with emphysema and passing away at 54. Dealing with all the ashtrays and horrible smell, after trying the gum and the patches and trying to quit cold turkey, even after
taking prescription anti-depressants designed to help you quit... I had my
first heart attack.  My doctors told me to quit.  ""It causes heart disease, and
cancer...""  everything I already knew.  </p>

</h3>Results-oriented, high-tech, animal-friendly skin care and waxing.<br/><br/>That's my idea, in a nutshell.<br/><br/>I have been a Licensed Esthetician for seven years, and a vegetarian for the better part of the last ten years. As an animal lover, I am passionate about protecting the rights of our furry, scaly, and feathery friends. As a skin care specialist, I am committed to effective, results-driven products and treatments. Far too often, I see brands that sacrifice one value for the other; effective but with questionable ingredients, healthy but don't deliver on their promises. Why can't you have both? <br/><br/>My goal is to create a space where the veggie and conscious client can feel confident that the products used will help them achieve optimal skin health (and beauty, of course) using only animal-free, ethically created products. <br/><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>My original goal for this project was $10,000, which is what you see over to the right. This amount will help to cover the start up costs, which include securing a location for the business, getting the required permits and licenses, furnishing and equipping the space, establishing a web presence, and the making the opening orders for products and supplies. Opening a business is expensive, even more so when the origin and quality of these products and supplies are of the utmost importance!<br/><br/><p></p>

</center>
<p></p>Every single little dollar counts in helping meet this goal, and even if the goal is not fully met, will help to cover the essentials, such as insurance, equipment, products and supplies. If I reach my big goal ($10k), VEGA Skincare Studio will be open full time, in a beautiful new community of salon studios in San Francisco's Russian Hill. If the goal is not met, I will do everything I can to still open for business, although the location and hours will be a little more up in the air. <br/><br/>The current perks available include major online gratitude (Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and the future VEGA Skincare Studio website) for smaller donations, hand crafted vegan soy candles with custom aromatherapy blends, and (for the big spenders) VIP discounts on products and services.

Results-oriented, high-tech, animal-friendly skin care and waxing.That's my idea, in a nutshell.I have been a Licensed Esthetician for seven years, and a vegetarian for the better part of the last ten years. As an animal lover, I am passionate about protecting the rights of our furry, scaly, and feathery friends. As a skin care specialist, I am committed to effective, results-driven products and treatments. Far too often, I see brands that sacrifice one value for the other; effective but with questionable ingredients, healthy but don't deliver on their promises. Why can't you have both? My goal is to create a space where the veggie and conscious client can feel confident that the products used will help them achieve optimal skin health (and beauty, of course) using only animal-free, ethically created products. What We Need & What You GetMy original goal for this project was $10,000, which is what you see over to the right. This amount will help to cover the start up costs, which include securing a location for the business, getting the required permits and licenses, furnishing and equipping the space, establishing a web presence, and the making the opening orders for products and supplies. Opening a business is expensive, even more so when the origin and quality of these products and supplies are of the utmost importance!

Check out my vision board on Pinterest to see how your contribution helps

Every single little dollar counts in helping meet this goal, and even if the goal is not fully met, will help to cover the essentials, such as insurance, equipment, products and supplies. If I reach my big goal ($10k), VEGA Skincare Studio will be open full time, in a beautiful new community of salon studios in San Francisco's Russian Hill. If the goal is not met, I will do everything I can to still open for business, although the location and hours will be a little more up in the air. The current perks available include major online gratitude (Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and the future VEGA Skincare Studio website) for smaller donations, hand crafted vegan soy candles with custom aromatherapy blends, and (for the big spenders) VIP discounts on products and services. Once I hit $5k, the perks will get even better, so let's make that happen!
The Impact I believe that skin care should be both results-oriented and cruelty-free, and VEGA Skincare Studio will provide a space where veggie and conscious clients can feel confident that their skin care goals will be met in a relaxing environment using products that are not tested on animals, and that do not contain any animal ingredients.

</p><p><font>Most people think that colon cancer 
  is just an old man's disease, perhaps because medical guidelines recommend regular 
  screening begin at the age of 50. But the truth is, this disease doesn't 
  discriminate in age, gender or race.  In fact, there is a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgwScm44WAM&amp;list=UU6KTt8XTnn-K-l9UDDvmJ8g&amp;feature=c4-overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>rising incidence trend</span></a> in the Under 50 population.</font></p>
<p>Grace De La Rosa was 38 when she was diagnosed with <a href=""http://www.ccalliance.org/colorectal_cancer/staging.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stage 3</a> <a href=""http://www.ccalliance.org/colorectal_cancer/overview.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colon Cancer</a>.  She had no family history of any type of cancer. She's a veteran  Navy pilot's wife, mother of two, who were 14 and 3 at the time. She was a swimwear  model, fitness instructor and fitness competitor. She worked out religiously and ate healthy foods. So Grace was shocked to hear the words, <em>You Have 
  Cancer</em>. </p>
<p>
  She had surgery to remove the golf ball-sized tumor from her colon and received 
  <font> <a href=""http://www.gracedelarosa.com/folfox1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FOLFOX</a> 
  chemo treatments</font> for 3 consecutive days, every other week, for six months.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women 
  combined in the U.S. But it's also one of the most preventable and treatable 
  cancers--if it's caught early.</p>
<p>Nobody likes to talk about colon cancer, because the symptoms associated 
  with this disease can be embarrassing to discuss with anyone, including your doctor. But 
  we're talking about a matter of life and death. Grace believes it's her responsibility 
  as a survivor to share the symptoms she experienced so others can be empowered 
  with this knowledge.</p>
<p>Her symptoms were all clear in hindsight. They included unexplained anemia (blood 
  loss) after the birth of each of her children.  She was given iron pills and sent home.  She experienced fatigue to the point where 
  she couldn't climb a flight of stairs without having to stop midway to catch 
  her breath.</p><p>Grace also experienced abdominal cramps which she thought were menstrual-related. 
  And she noticed a tiny speck of blood <i>once</i> when she wiped. She assumed it was a spotty menstrual cycle or hemorrhoids which she'd 
  never experienced.</p><p>Just a 
  few months prior to her diagnosis, Grace noticed when she passed gas the odor was abnormally foul, 
  as if something was dying inside of her. She simply assumed it was something 
  she ate.</p>
<p><font>If there's just one piece of advice 
  Grace wants to instill in others, it's this: Don't 
  brush off symptoms that aren't ""normal"" for you. Your doctor may be 
  a medical expert, but you are the expert of your own body. Trust your gut. Be proactive in your health care. Know the <a href=""http://ccalliance.org/colorectal_cancer/symptoms.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">symptoms</a> 
  of colon cancer. Go to your doctor, especially if you have a family history of 
  colon cancer, and request a screening, even if you're under 50.</font></p><p> </p>

Most people think that colon cancer 
  is just an old man's disease, perhaps because medical guidelines recommend regular 
  screening begin at the age of 50. But the truth is, this disease doesn't 
  discriminate in age, gender or race.  In fact, there is a rising incidence trend in the Under 50 population.
Grace De La Rosa was 38 when she was diagnosed with Stage 3 Colon Cancer.  She had no family history of any type of cancer. She's a veteran  Navy pilot's wife, mother of two, who were 14 and 3 at the time. She was a swimwear  model, fitness instructor and fitness competitor. She worked out religiously and ate healthy foods. So Grace was shocked to hear the words, You Have 
  Cancer. 

  She had surgery to remove the golf ball-sized tumor from her colon and received 
   FOLFOX 
  chemo treatments for 3 consecutive days, every other week, for six months.
Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women 
  combined in the U.S. But it's also one of the most preventable and treatable 
  cancers--if it's caught early.
Nobody likes to talk about colon cancer, because the symptoms associated 
  with this disease can be embarrassing to discuss with anyone, including your doctor. But 
  we're talking about a matter of life and death. Grace believes it's her responsibility 
  as a survivor to share the symptoms she experienced so others can be empowered 
  with this knowledge.
Her symptoms were all clear in hindsight. They included unexplained anemia (blood 
  loss) after the birth of each of her children.  She was given iron pills and sent home.  She experienced fatigue to the point where 
  she couldn't climb a flight of stairs without having to stop midway to catch 
  her breath.Grace also experienced abdominal cramps which she thought were menstrual-related. 
  And she noticed a tiny speck of blood once when she wiped. She assumed it was a spotty menstrual cycle or hemorrhoids which she'd 
  never experienced.Just a 
  few months prior to her diagnosis, Grace noticed when she passed gas the odor was abnormally foul, 
  as if something was dying inside of her. She simply assumed it was something 
  she ate.
If there's just one piece of advice 
  Grace wants to instill in others, it's this: Don't 
  brush off symptoms that aren't ""normal"" for you. Your doctor may be 
  a medical expert, but you are the expert of your own body. Trust your gut. Be proactive in your health care. Know the symptoms 
  of colon cancer. Go to your doctor, especially if you have a family history of 
  colon cancer, and request a screening, even if you're under 50. 
OUR PROJECTThis year marks Grace's 9th year as a colon cancer survivor. She created the Be a 
campaign in support of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month with a mission to educate the community about colon cancer and the importance of early detection, to give hope to newly diagnosed patients, and to save lives by spreading the word through:

Group Presentations. Grace is available to speak with your organization about colon cancer through a survivor's point of view.

Production of Colon Cancer Awareness Video. Grace teamed up with Enfocus Media, Inc., led by Emmy Award-winning director Bernardo Santana III to produce an awareness video featuring Grace's story along with conversations from other local colon cancer survivors. This video will be used as another means to further educate others about this disease.

Creation of an online presence to reach a large audience through our Be a Blue Buddy Facebook page, Grace's online cancer journal, and this fundraising web page.

 GOALSWe can't do this without your help. That's why we want you to Be a . Contribute to our campaign and help us raise funds to donate to Colon Cancer Alliance's Blue Note Fund. The fund provides financial assistance to patients and their families so they can focus on getting well instead of stressing about mounting bills. Please donate generously.

  CANCER FACTS & SYMPTOMSColorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women combined 
  in the U.S. It's also one of the most preventable and treatable cancers if it's caught early.The American Cancer Society estimates that 136,830 people in the U.S. will be 
  diagnosed with colorectal cancer  and that 50,310 will die in 2014. 
  About 72% of cases arise in the colon and about 28% in the rectum.  On average, the lifetime risk of 
  developing colon cancer is about 1 in 20 (5%).  However, this varies widely according to individual risk 
  factors.Jacksonville, FL - Duval County’s Incidence and Death Rates per 100,000 are 46.7 and 17.2, respectively, according to Northeast Florida Counts' latest statistics from 2010.Symptoms may include:

Anemia
Fatigue
Blood - red or dark
Gas
Bloating, Constipation
Nausea, Vomiting
Diarrhea
Narrow, Ribbon-Like Stools
Unexplained Weight Loss

Talk to your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.  The earlier you're diagnosed, the better chance of survival.

It all started when my daughter, Andrea, developed eczema shortly after birth. She was the reason why I began my research into natural skin care, and making soap for her in my kitchen late at nights when all the children were asleep. </p><p>We have since grown to have a handful of lovely, helpful part-time staff who help me man our tiny shop and ship out packages to our customers all over the world--but I am still chiefly responsible for the actual production of every single product we offer. </p><p>You can read more about our origins <a href=""http://www.kindersoaps.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p><p>I would like to think that our mantra, ""Kindness Comes Naturally"", has extended beyond our products, to the way we treat our earth and its inhabitants in everything that we do. Here are some ways we are trying to accomplish this:</p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<b>All our products are made from natural, plant-based ingredients</b>, and may include other additives like beeswax and goat's milk. We stay clear of petrochemical products like artificial fragrances and preservatives so that people with really sensitive skin will benefit from the absence of these common skin irritants, and we won't be contributing harsh pollutants into waterways. </li>
<li>
<b>We have recently ditched plastic shrink wrapping</b> as a means of protecting our soap (yay!), and swapped over to making our own reusable, 100% biodegradable beeswax cotton wraps. They are a bit fussier to produce and handle, but I strongly believe in doing everything we possibly can to reduce our dependence on throwaway plastic. </li>
<li>
<b>We run a recycling programme for some of our packaging materials. </b>Customers return our beeswax cotton wraps to us for recycling, and receive complimentary bars of soap as a small token of thanks.</li>
</ol><p>Despite the positive feedback we have been receiving consistently over the years, I would like to make it clear that <b>we do NOT create 'miracle' products that will definitely 'cure' any skin ailment</b>. We can only promise to work ethically, and that our choice of ingredients will always be partial to things which are as minimally processed as possible, and free from artificial fragrances and preservatives. I personally work really hard at doing my research into ingredients before deciding to add them to any of our formulations, spending countless late nights having mental debates with myself over skincare and health-related research papers, articles etc.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, here are some scenes from typical working day, which I try to also share on our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/kindersoaps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> to keep in touch with customers:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/381602/files/20140219183150-IGG_Collage.png?1392863510"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Since then, I have used my experience and knowledge about plant-based skin care to help scores of people cope with, if not completely overcome, various skin complaints ranging from acne to eczema.

My son is responding very well, the itch immediately goes away and so far it is not spreading. I have tried numerous creams and even natural products, but these oils are proving to be the most promising and fast-responding. -Jasvin J. (15 June 2014)""
""I was introduced to Kinder Soaps by a friend who noticed my acne prone back. She was kind to share some Clarity soap for me to try and not only it controlled my acne, I feel in love (with) Clarity. It prompted me to buy the 12-Soaps-A-Year package. I’m now down to my last 4 bars (out of 12) and will be replenishing my stock, without a doubt. I adore Clarity because it does not leave my skin with pulling feeling after cleansing with soap. I have used Clarity from top to toe. Yes including my hair and face, not only on my acne prone back.So if you need to control oil / sebum on your skin, especially on your back (like me), Clarity is your solution. -Yuen Chin (12 June 2014)""
Saving Skins, One Shower At A Time.Hi, I'm Michelle, founder and resident soap artisan at Kinder Soaps. For the past 6 years I have been formulating, researching, and making all-natural, handmade bath and body care goods for sensitive and problematic skin in Malaysia. It all started when my daughter, Andrea, developed eczema shortly after birth. She was the reason why I began my research into natural skin care, and making soap for her in my kitchen late at nights when all the children were asleep. We have since grown to have a handful of lovely, helpful part-time staff who help me man our tiny shop and ship out packages to our customers all over the world--but I am still chiefly responsible for the actual production of every single product we offer. You can read more about our origins here. I would like to think that our mantra, ""Kindness Comes Naturally"", has extended beyond our products, to the way we treat our earth and its inhabitants in everything that we do. Here are some ways we are trying to accomplish this:

All our products are made from natural, plant-based ingredients, and may include other additives like beeswax and goat's milk. We stay clear of petrochemical products like artificial fragrances and preservatives so that people with really sensitive skin will benefit from the absence of these common skin irritants, and we won't be contributing harsh pollutants into waterways. 

We have recently ditched plastic shrink wrapping as a means of protecting our soap (yay!), and swapped over to making our own reusable, 100% biodegradable beeswax cotton wraps. They are a bit fussier to produce and handle, but I strongly believe in doing everything we possibly can to reduce our dependence on throwaway plastic. 

We run a recycling programme for some of our packaging materials. Customers return our beeswax cotton wraps to us for recycling, and receive complimentary bars of soap as a small token of thanks.
Despite the positive feedback we have been receiving consistently over the years, I would like to make it clear that we do NOT create 'miracle' products that will definitely 'cure' any skin ailment. We can only promise to work ethically, and that our choice of ingredients will always be partial to things which are as minimally processed as possible, and free from artificial fragrances and preservatives. I personally work really hard at doing my research into ingredients before deciding to add them to any of our formulations, spending countless late nights having mental debates with myself over skincare and health-related research papers, articles etc.Anyway, here are some scenes from typical working day, which I try to also share on our Facebook page to keep in touch with customers:Since then, I have used my experience and knowledge about plant-based skin care to help scores of people cope with, if not completely overcome, various skin complaints ranging from acne to eczema. (To know more about our soap, visit our FAQ page.) My customers' support has been overwhelming over the years, for which I will always be grateful. My four little children are also benefiting from the fruits of my labour (that's our youngest, Sean, up there in the photo)!And in case you're wondering - yes, Andrea is now free from eczema, thanks to some simple dietary and lifestyle choices. :)Why I Need RM100,000 I want to extensively renovate my 1,200 sqft soap studio so that it will be be compliant with the ASEAN Cosmetics Directive's Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). This is expected to cost around RM80,000. After considering the cost of materials which I will need to make your perks and take care of shipping costs, I reckon the amount of cash I'd really need would be closer to RM100,000 (~USD30,000).My original sketch of the desired floorplan:... and the digital version which was finally given the green light on the 31st of July 2014, after months of discussions and negotiations with the GMP division of Malaysia's National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau (NPCB):What This Means For People With Sensitive Skin
Improving the quality of life for so many people (we have received so many thank-you emails over the years) - I realise now that we don't just make bath and body products! So now I want to be able to bring our products beyond Malaysian shores in a much bigger way than what we are doing at present.

Our products will always conscientiously made. Kinder Soaps will be audited annually by the GMP division of the NPCB for quality control purposes. What this means for you is that we will need to always maintain proper paperwork for quality control purposes. I am not the most fastidious of people when it comes to this sort of thing, but I do believe that following a framework as set out by the ASEAN Cosmetics Initiative is worth every bit of the effort it requires. It is a good place to start in terms of building even more accountability and transparency in how a small business like ours is run.

We want to take Kinder Soaps global. Carrying on from points 1 and 2, having a GMP-compliant studio opens up many doors, specifically with regards to the commercial export of our products, which requires something called a Certificate Of Free Sale.
I want to channel more of my time and energy into formulating new products for tackling other skincare and health-related applications by setting up all the necessary processes to go with a GMP compliant studio (which will include hiring dedicated production staff). I will of course be always turning to completely natural, plant-based ingredients.
In summary, I'd like to reach out to more people who may benefit from using our products, as well as to find new ways of soothing and nourishing troubled skin.What Renovation Work Will Be Required?Here's what the space looked like when I first moved in, about 3 and a half years ago. It's functional, but not exactly very impressive :"") Some of the major undertakings include
removing the carpeting and redoing the floor,
building rooms for various processes (see the floorplan above)
building storage areas,
reworking light fixtures,
reworking drainage and plumbing systems,
installation of ventilation fans and new air conditioners,

installation of a good water filtration system,
setting up a proper quality control system in accordance with GMP guidelines,
hiring and training new staff specifically for production work.

So if we do face the happy situation of having more than we need for the renovation work, here's what we'll be using the cash for:

set aside more funding for research and development (R&D) and trials of new products (I personally would like to find something effective to help with psoriasis and keratosis, for starters)
invest in nicer furniture for the office/retail area (because my staff and customers deserve a pretty place to hang out!)
What If We DON'T Hit Our Target Funding?This is definitely a possibility. :"") Here are the 'escape routes' I can take, and reasons why I would really rather not have to consider them:

Apply for a personal loan, or charge my credit cards. By far the most obvious alternative, but I would prefer not to work for the bank over the next few years just to pay these loans off... And besides, my expertise in helping to heal and soothe the skin isn't very useful to a corporation--it is most suited to helping individuals like yourself.

Postpone the studio renovation until I have amassed enough cash. This feels like a bit of a cop-out to me, because I would basically just go back to doing business as usual, while fulfilling your orders, and not exactly taking the next big step towards anything in the near future. Then there's also the risk of losing steam after a while, and I certainly don't want to experience that...
Rework the design of the studio to match the amount of funds we manage to raise. This depends on the final amount we manage to raise. There is a little bit of wriggle room with regards to kitting out the studio (it certainly won't be as pretty as I'd imagine it to be!), but I certainly don't intend to cut corners on safety and functionality.

I'm flattered, thank you so much... Okay, so here's a 20-minute show about Kinder Soaps which was recorded and aired on Malaysia's satellite TV, Astro, in 2012. I was expecting Sean at the time, hence the baby bump that accompanied me during the interview. I hope that this interview will give you an insight into how I think, how I run Kinder Soaps and what has transpired in the past two years till today.Please pardon my over-use of the word ""obviously"" and the phrase ""and all that"" - I blame it on being nervous in front of the camera!Again, thank you SO much for staying with me all the way to this stage. I hope that you will make a pledge to help Kinder Soaps reach even more people, to get them comfortable in their skin.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Makers of Absinthia Rubra, The Red American Absinthe &amp; Marion Black 106,The Spirit of Florida</p>
<p>Fully licensed and operating craft distillery in the piney woods of rural Marion County Florida.</p>
<p><br/>We are engaged in the brand launch of our premium Red American Absinthe, Absinthia Rubra.   Absinthia Rubra is a real absinthe, made with the ""trinity"" of wormwood, anise &amp; fennel as well as other fine herbs. It is hand crafted in Florida from all natural locally grown ingredients. No artificial flavors, no artificial colors.  Available in Florida from Republic National Distributing Company.</p>
<p>We have two distinct levels of funding needed to successful launch our products. An initial test marketing budget and then a marketing campaign budget. Take a quick look at our Facebook page and you will see the types of events we currently attend.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo project is for bridge funding to provide operational funds from non predatory sources to conduct test marketing.  Once we achieve the best marketing campaign plan, we will be seeking a larger amount of funding to launch a statewide campaign.  <br/></p>
<h3>Our Hope is to escape the need to involve traditional venture capitalists.</h3>
<p>This project has been in development for 4 years. The firm was organized in May 2011 and final licensure was secured in April 2012.  </p>
<p>We consistently hear from consumers that ""real"" absinthe is not legal to produce or sell in the US.  People believe the Green Fairy is trapped by federal regulations.  Not any longer. As of 2007 it is legal to produce Absinthe in the US  and our first product was bottled and shipped in September 2012.  Alas, it still requires a significant marketing budget to let people know where they can go to <em>dance with the green fairy</em> and this is what we hope you will assist us to accomplish<em>. </em></p>
<p>We have had inquiries from traditional Venture Capitalists, seeking a controlling equity share to ""take us to the big time""  we hope to avoid that route by appealing to you to help our cause.</p>
<p>This initial bridge funding will allow us to run the test marketing campaigns and fine tune them to achieve the maximum impact for minimum cost.  Once concluded, we will raise the funds to launch the state wide campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not in a position to contribute you can still help us out!  You can purchase our products at your local retailer. When you ask them to special order our products from RNDC, they can have it for you to buy within a week or so at no additional charge.  Spread the word at your local bar and retailer that high quality, hand made, Red American Absinthe and Premium Tangerine Brandy are available from Fish Hawk Spirits, Ocala, Florida.  Don't forget to share this campaign with your friends and visit us on Facebook  Look at the gallery for Fish Hawk art and photos.</p>

<h3>11 Years</h3>
<p>1919 Hemphill is a DIY, volunteer run community space and punk venue in Fort Worth, TX. We have been around 11 years, an incredibly long time for a space of this type. But in order to keep our doors open, we need your help. We are always running on a month-to-month basis as we make only enough money to keep our doors open. Our building is constantly in need of repairs and our equipment needs updating.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>DIY or DIY</h3>
<p>We need improvements in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roof repairs - the roof leaks, as anyone who's come to a show on a rainy day knows.</li>
<li>Further AC improvements: we made a lot of progress since last year, but we can always make it better in those hot summer months. We would also like to get some new, high powered fans</li>
<li>PA Equipment: shows are how we make most of our donations, and we would like to improve our speakers and make repairs to the ones we already have</li>
<li>The Back Yard: we would like our back yard to be a more welcoming hangout space. We need to buy sand, gravel, seating and other stuff</li>
<li>A New Sign: the sign on the front of our building is old and faded. We would like to get a vibrant new one to catch everyone's attention</li>
<li>Day to Day Expenses: Rent and electricity eat up most, if not all, of our budget most months. These are the basic necessities to keep 1919 open. Last year, we managed to make the money from the fundraiser stretch all the way through the summer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Merch!</h3>
<div>We are keeping it simple this year as far as gifts. Anyone who donates $30 or more gets a koozie, an Indiegogo contributer exclusive new T-Shirt, a new patch, a sticker and a tape compilation featuring bands that have played at 1919. The only way to get the shirt is to contribute here and everything will be ready in time for Xmas!.</div>
<h3>Keep Punk Alive</h3>
<p>1919 Hemphill is the longest running DIY space in Texas, and one of the oldest in the country. DIY spots are notoriously temporary and long-running spaces are very few and far between. Other than being a meeting space and venue, 1919 provides clothing and other resources to the community and is a safe space for people of all ages to find out about new bands and develop a love for music for its own sake.</p>

<h3>Lend a Helping Hand</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute, we still need your help. We always need new furniture for the downstairs area, so if you have a clean couch or chair, let us know and we would love to take it.

<p><font size=""3"">The Localstride team consists of talented engineers, programmers, and marketers looking to create something different than just another directory or daily deal site. We are working on a social experiment called Localstride. The
 main focus is to connect communities and local activities together that
 share a common interest. We are working to solve the question we have 
all sat and wondered; ""What can I do today, tonight, this weekend, 
whenever??"" Localstride is based on the idea that people want to be part of 
something special, something unique. To stay informed and at the same 
time share it with like-minded people. We are developing a service that 
allows people to gain access to information and perks to those things 
that interest them most. This will be anything from live music, outdoor recreation, 
sporting events, dining specials, arts and festivals, charity events; really any form of entertainment 
and activity that can be found locally that may interest you. It will also be a hub for you to discover and follow local bands and venues that match your selected music genre preferences. We are 
looking to raise funding so that we can take time from our current responsibilities and dedicate our full attention 
to writing the programming around the recommendation engine and 
finalizing the User Interface around this logic for the website and applications. Funding will also go to database, equipment costs, and other expenses included in starting an online business.<br/></font></p>

from the in-flight menu?

Hello! I am Nikos and I am launching a
website all about the world of airline buy on board menus, and I want to go 'undercover' on 23 flights to rate/taste and review airline food. The website will showcase over 60 airlines worldwide who offer some form of buy on board meal options for passengers. All airlines will be featured on my website, and you have the opportunity to make this research project happen! The research will also help me to continue writing articles about airline food options for passengers. (http://blog.apex.aero/inflight-services-2/economy-class-passengers-dine-class/) You tube videos will be compiled for each airline experience, and uploaded to my channel from April/May this year. All donations no matter how big or small (unless you want to remain anonymous) will be featured on the Inflight Feed website for the rest of the year. It will display the perk chosen by you, and your information. If you wish not to be featured just let me know!

Not a sightseeing trip! 

The
project
is a 27,833km journey on 23 airlines across Europe to sample as many different airline buy on board food options. Once complete all the data will be used to inform passengers of what's available to eat on various airlines, as well as what options vegetarians, gluten free, diabetic and religious passengers can eat! A blog will feature my travels and each
airline that I fly on whilst I also check quality/presentation, taste,
price and service delivery. On each flight I will conduct research,
and purchase/sample meals whilst documenting each experience with you. This project is a perfect way to review airlines myself, get a little media attention for my website, whilst hopefully benefiting a charity too!


Possible Route Map Across Europe, does not include all flights, example only.


I am passionate about airlines and especially airline food. I was
fortunate enough to spend the last 8 years working in the airline
industry. The idea for the website came about whilst working at
an airline, passengers would complain about the lack of food items on the menu, their complaints went unheard. So the idea was born, a platform for passengers to review their experiences with airline buy on board options, as well as an information source for future travelers to stay informed about their dining options.

I
hope to fly anywhere from 3 to 5 sectors per day with different
airlines, sampling their menu options, sleeping at airport hotels, or
sometimes returning home the same day if possible. The flights would be split up into mini trips covering vast
areas over a period of time. Flights should take place March/April
2012. The trip will see me stopping in
Hamburg on the 27th March for 3 days to coincide, and visit, the World Travel Catering & Onboard services expo.

The JourneyA
27,883km (approx) airline flying journey across Europe flying with 23 of the following 30 airlines: Aer
Lingus, Air Baltic, Air Berlin, Air Europa, Blue1, bmibaby, Brussels
Airlines, Cimber Sterling, Condor, easyJet, Finnair, NIKI, Flybe,
Germanwings, Helvetic Airways, Iberia, Icelandair, Iceland Express, Jet2, KLM, Monarch Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, SAS,Thomson Airways, Transavia.com, TUIfly, Condor, Vueling and Wizz Air.Note the original idea included flying onto North America and conducting a further 15 flights with airlines in Canada and the USA, meaning the trip would be around 60,000km! I felt it was more realistic to try and raise funds for the European portion at least!
Why?
Our friends at Branding Aero in New York (picture above) conducted some of the very first inflight reviews on our behalf, highlighting dining options for passengers on several US based airlines. With funding the project will be able to review many more airlines, these reviews are then used to provide passengers with information, tips, reviews, and premium dining options. I
am not worried about the destinations I will fly to, that's not
important. What is important is to fly on as many different airlines
as possible. 


The
Impact

On Airlines
I believe this will have an impact on airlines, raise more awareness of their menus, and hopefully show that not all airline meals are the same. I want to show passengers that there are great options out there to choose from.
I don't believe that anyone has ever completed a trip such as this before, so it would be the first of its kind. 

Charity
Just like your local fun run, I am trying to raise awareness of my flying trip. Ideally I would like to be able to donate some serious money (through a sponsor) from this event to a charity that possibly deals with hunger.
 
If I fly 27,000km and ask a sponsor to sponsor me anywhere from 0.25 cents to 0.50cents per kilometer flown, this could be a nice donation of anywhere between $6,500 to  $13,500 for a charity. Just need the sponsor first!! I have made a few submissions already.

I am open to suggestions from my community, so talk to me and let me know what you think!








What I need

The
funds are to cover most of the cost of flights, inflight meal purchases, and
travel expenses incurred during the project. Approximate figures are
below, I have conducted research into flight sectors and approximate
costings. If full funding is not reached, only part of the project can be completed. Depending on the funds donated I may be able to sample a few different airlines only.

Approximate
cost breakdowns

<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p>Simple Diaper &amp; Linen (formerly Mother Herb Diaper Service) is a Northampton, MA based business driven by a passion for working with communities to benefit the environment, family health, and our economy. We are cooperatively-owned and mother-operated. We provide diapering alternatives that reduces waste and improves the comfort and health of your children. Our energy-efficient machines, chemical-free laundering, and local delivery by bicycle supports our mission of eco-sustainability. Our services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>cloth &amp; compostable diaper services</li>
<li>commercial linen service</li>
<li>100% chemical &amp; fragrance fee laundering </li>
<li>Pickup and delivery to your door step!</li>
</ul><p><em>But we do ALL of this in a basement!</em></p>
<p>Our current space provides us with many limitations. Our small residential machines limit our capacity to serving only 30 families and 3 linen clients and we have minimal storage and workspace. Moving to a commercial space with HUGE commercial machines will significantly increase our capacity and our productivity (and lets us see the light of day!) We will be able to expand our services from four towns to an entire region including The greater Springfield, Holyoke, Northampton, and Greenfield areas (even Brattelboro, VT!) that have been asking for our service to come to them for years.</p>
<p><strong>The Mamas</strong></p>
<p>Angie Gregory and Jessica Montagna are two mothers who are committed to building a service that makes low-impact diapering easy, affordable, and flexible for those early years of parenting (Jessica is a former satisfied client!). We strive to create living wages for our family of worker-owners and bulid a vast network of support and advocay for sustaibable diapering in our community. Together we bring over 15 years of experience and expertise in cloth diapering, natural parenting, and environmental stewardship.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Your help is critical to our expansion and every dollar you contribute will be matched by a very generous donor!</strong> After years of business planning we have been approved for a loan,<em> and need to close a gap of $19,000 for the loan to be released!</em> This portion will support the purchase of our new cloth diaper inventory -our first order - a whopping 12,000 cloth diapers and wipes!</p>
<p><strong>But, if we don't reach our Indiegogo goal by the deadline...</strong>your contribution will be refunded, our donor won't make their match, our lender will not lend to us, and we'll be stuck in the basement!</p>
<p>Not only will your support come with some fun perks, but it will also come with our most sincere thanks and a tangible mark on the movement away from wasteful diapering!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We appreciate any amount you can contribute financially, but there are also other ways for you to support Simple Diaper &amp; Linen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with your friends and family!</li>
<li>Donate your skills and expertise with us! During renovations of our new space we will need plumbing work, carpentry, help prepping all of the cloth diapers, and help moving!</li>

Angie Gregory and Jessica Montagna are two mothers who are committed to building a service that makes low-impact diapering easy, affordable, and flexible for those early years of parenting (Jessica is a former satisfied client!). We strive to create living wages for our family of worker-owners and bulid a vast network of support and advocay for sustaibable diapering in our community. Together we bring over 15 years of experience and expertise in cloth diapering, natural parenting, and environmental stewardship.
What We Need
Your help is critical to our expansion and every dollar you contribute will be matched by a very generous donor! After years of business planning we have been approved for a loan, and need to close a gap of $19,000 for the loan to be released! This portion will support the purchase of our new cloth diaper inventory -our first order - a whopping 12,000 cloth diapers and wipes!
But, if we don't reach our Indiegogo goal by the deadline...your contribution will be refunded, our donor won't make their match, our lender will not lend to us, and we'll be stuck in the basement!
Not only will your support come with some fun perks, but it will also come with our most sincere thanks and a tangible mark on the movement away from wasteful diapering!
Other Ways You Can Help
We appreciate any amount you can contribute financially, but there are also other ways for you to support Simple Diaper & Linen.

Share this campaign with your friends and family!
Donate your skills and expertise with us! During renovations of our new space we will need plumbing work, carpentry, help prepping all of the cloth diapers, and help moving!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I will go
to Ethiopia on the 21st November for 12 days with a team called Salaam Garage where
each team member will create an individual project to support the Ethiopian
women with obstetric fistula and raise the profile of the Hamlin Hospital who
deeply care for these women.
Obstetric FISTULA is
a preventable condition that can occur to women during childbirth leaving the
women in a state of permanent incontinence of urine and or feces. This
condition can often leave them ostracized from their families and communities
with no support.  The Hamlin Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia is making a difference.
The Project
I plan to exhibit, then
create and publish a book.  The proceeds from these 2 events will go
directly to the Hospital.  
 
The hospital treats
2000 women every year but thousands more go untreated.  The majority of

With financial support

family are needs that welcome the women at the Hamlin Hospital
and I wish to capture that joy and hope.  This
project will happen, but to what extent will depend on your support.

<p>Franglish
is a language exchange event that offers language learners of all
different levels a unique opportunity to practice and improve a
foreign language. Each
event
consists of a series of 15-minute 1-to-1 conversations during which
half the time you speak in English and the other half in another
language giving both native speakers the chance to practice their
foreign language. It's up to you what you talk about – there are no
rules! At the end of the 15 minutes, you are directed to a new table
where you meet a different partner, and so on for 2 hours. The events
will be held at carefully chosen bars around town to ensure a
chilled-out, no-pressure environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p><i>
SO
IT'S SPEED-DATING, RIGHT?</i></p>
<p>
No.
Well, that's not the aim. But we would expect an invitation to the

<p>
Seriously
though, Franglish is not an after-work nor some sort of new-age
approach speed dating: this is a social event that allows you to discover new languages and new cultures.<br/><br/></p>

<p>
Since
its launch in Paris in 2010, Franglish has proven to be extremely popular. Since then we have been able to spread the concept to a
number of towns and cities across France and the UK. Driven by our
belief that language learning should be accessible to absolutely
everyone, we want our events to be FREE. The money you donate will
help us launch free English/French and English/Spanish events in New
York by November 2014. Your contributions will go towards the
initial start-up costs including venue-hire, the purchase of
essential event materials and promotion of Franglish in and around
New York.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/800446/files/20140820071156-Video-Crowdfunding-2014-3.jpg?1408543916"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<p>
Encouraged
by our success across Europe, we've decided it's time to take
Franglish across the pond. Our concept is new, it's unique and it's
exciting: there's nothing like this on offer in New York. Our Paris
events are also especially popular with American tourists and expats,
many of whom have suggested we launch in the US. You can't get much
more cosmopolitan than New York, but getting to know foreigners as a
local is often easier said than done. Similarly, tourists and expats
can find it difficult to strike up conversation with locals.
Franglish offers the perfect solution.

Partners in Gender Equality


Association de Bienfaisance pour le Développement et la Solidarite and Association Oxygene, working with Peace Corps-Morocco's Gender and Development Committee are excited to announce our 2014 Gender Advocate Training, bringing together Moroccans and Peace Corps Volunteers from all over the country to advance the cause of gender equality in Morocco. 


Why? 


Gender inequality is a global challenge and one that we believe is important to address here in Morocco. A report two years ago showed that female participation in the labor market did not exceed 25% at the time, and that 80% of young females from the countryside drop out of school between grades 1 and 6. Moroccans from all corners of the country have recognized the prevalence of gender inequality and are looking for ways to address them. There have been notable victories in recent years through the changes in the Family Code laws that have greatly expanded the rights of women. Although we celebrate these victories, we know that there is more work to be done. This project will allow us to capitalize on the current momentum and begin to affect change at the local level through a grassroots approach. We need your help to train the next change agents here in Morocco.  

How?

 We will bring together 30 Moroccans and their Peace Corps Volunteer counterparts for a three-day workshop to work with both Peace Corps Volunteers and Moroccans on how to address gender issues in their communities. Activities include:


Discussion of gender issues facing Morocco in general and individual communities in particular.
How to assess where your community is and where progress can be made
How to identify resources to tackle gender issues
Strategies for being a Gender Advocate
A tool-kit on Gender Advocacy


At the end of the training, each Moroccan + Volunteer team will be given a tool-kit to take back to their community and present in their youth center, women's center, school or other community gathering place. 
The tool-kit is designed to give Moroccans and Volunteers a launch pad for gender work in their community and to give Moroccans the resources they need to continue the work with or without future Peace Corps Volunteers to assist them. 
In addition, each Moroccan participant will now have a network of 29 other Moroccans throughout the country who they can turn to for advice and information.
Who?
Association de Bienfaisance pour le Développement et la Solidarite and Association Oxygene are partnering with the Peace Corps-Morocco Gender and Development Committee to produce this training. All three organizations have experience doing on the ground work to benefit Moroccans and a track record of success. Past projects include:
Association de Bienfaisance pour le Développement et la Solidarite has worked with USAID and the Peace Corps to develop a boys' empowerment camp. They have also partnered with Morocco's Ministry of Education to create a literacy program for women in rural communities.

Association Oxygene has been widely recognized throughout Morocco for it's powerful work with women in Ouarzazate and surrounding communities. Oxygene has worked with the United Nations Development Program and the Global Fund for Women to teach women entrepreneurship and business skills.


Peace Corps Morocco's Gender and Development committee 
has been recognized by
U.S. Peace Corps in 2013 as one of the agency’s highest performing Gender and
Development Working groups.  The Gender and Development committee recently produced a documentary on sexual harassment called, ""Breaking the Silence,"" which has been screened throughout Morocco.


What We Need & Why We Need It

 
$4,600 will cover the full training for 60 people. This includes:
 Travel for workshop participants from all over Morocco to convene in one of two locations (Fez, home of the world's oldest oldest university or Ouarzazate, home of the set for the City of Pentos in Game of Thrones!)
Food and beverage for all participants. This includes the approximately 72 gallons of sweet mint tea that the average person in Morocco consumes in any 24-hour period
All materials for the Gender Advocate Toolkit, Resource Development plans, and community assessment tools our Gender Advocates will receive.
Translation services so that language is not a barrier to participating in the Gender Advocate Training


The Impact





We dream big. Our ultimate goal is nothing less than full gender equality throughout Morocco. 
But schwiya b schwiya (little by little) as we say in Morocco. So for now we will expect to unleash a group of gender advocates who are ready and willing to get to work in their communities ASAP.
2014 is our first training but we hope to continue this training in years to come, moving from 30 people to 60 to 90 to hundreds and then thousands! 
In the meantime, we'll focus on our first group of 30. Not only will the participants return to their local communities as advocates for gender equality, but also as resource developers and community facilitators, all of which has potential to yield significant grassroots level impact. They will implement gender equality initiatives and lead gender-related activities with 600+ youth upon their return, and they will have the tools to develop their own, more effective, gender-based resources for use by Moroccans all over the country. 
The sky is the limit for impact, and our confidence and expectations are high. 
Risks & Challenges



  This is our first training. It's possible that we will discover some challenges with the format or with the materials. Some areas we already know to watch for potential problems: 
Ensuring equal participation between men and women. We believe that men and women both need to be part of the conversation on gender equality. 

Addressing gender issues within different cultural contexts: Morocco is one country but we have a lot of diversity. Gender issues in Arab vs. Amazight (Berber) culture or urban vs. rural communities may be too numerous to address in one training. 
 Sustainability: While we want to train Peace Corps Volunteers as well as Moroccans, the program is designed to make sure that gender advocacy continues beyond the length of a Peace Corps Volunteers' two-year assignment. But we know that some Moroccans may still have difficulty launching work after their counterpart has left the community.
 
 All of these issues have been discussed by the Association de Bienfaisance pour le Développement et la Solidarite and Association Oxygene and our partners on the GAD Committee and we will be monitoring this training and doing follow-up to evaluate our success, tweaking the program as needed in future years.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

We made a simple GPS tracking device and all the software around to have a complete system.</p><h2 style=""text-align: left;""><b>4 solved problems and a solution to many others</b></h2><p>
</p><p>In
CUSTODIUM we work in location and GPS tracking. During the
development of our devices and systems, we found 4 basic problems:</p><p><b>Out of range location</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113361/files/20141223051533-sincobertura.png?1419340533"" src="""" style=""width: 106.23px; height: 120px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
In outside location and open areas the
GPS is very useful but when we are in indoor areas the GPS signal
lose coverage. As well as, in rural area the GPS works properly,
however the mobile networks don´t have enough coverage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
So that's why we thought about
reinforce our device with wireless networks widely used such as
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Custom IoT include the use of these
networks for <b>WIRELESS COMMUNICATION</b></p><h4>Self-sufficiency</h4><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113362/files/20141223051615-iconmonstr-battery-11-icon-256.png?1419340575"" src="""" style=""width: 88px; height: 88px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
In general, the
electronic devices have a lack of self-sufficiency, that sooner or
later run out and it's necessary to recharge it. This matter
especially affects when it refers to apps that have to go on months
or years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
To solve this
problem we thought in adding recharge systems based on renowable
energies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Therefore Custom
IoT could supply with any power source that provide electric energy,
mini-solar, micro-wind, dynamos... <b>WE ARE GREEN!</b></p><h4>Secure data</h4><b>
<br/></b><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113363/files/20141223051715-File-Lock-icon.png?1419340635"" src="""" style=""width: 81px; height: 81px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><h4><br/></h4>
<p>
</p><p>
When we operate
with data position the limit is to lose them, so that it's necessary
to make back-up copies knowing where the data are to recover them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
In Custodim we
send the data to the cloud to save copies but not always there is
connection to send it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
To solve it we
include a memory card. As a result, Custom IoT save the data, it
doesn't matter small or big data, the most important is to save data. <b>SECURE DATA!</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113364/files/20141223051808-feelandact.png?1419340688"" src="""" style=""width: 130px; height: 130px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>Feel &amp; act</b></h4>
<p>
</p><p>We
think the location is important, but we could go further away adding
information from sensors to use in health, work security, environment
information...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We
included a high number of useful sensors and actuators to solve the
problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus,
Custom IoT has serial ports of sensors and actuators that could be
useful in an important quantity of different scenes. <b>FEEL

<h2>The story behind custodium:</h2>
<h4></h4>
<p>All started the last year in a conversation between two friends, Ernesto and Jose who were talking about Jose's father, who suffer from Alzheimer. Jose wanted to have located his father in order to help him when it was necessary. He was looking for a GPS tracker in the market, but there wasn´t any suitable for Alzheimer´s sufferers. The main problem was that the GPS devices in the market were bracelet or necklace so it is easy to pull out it by Alzheimer's patients.</p>
<p>After that,we were developing a GPS tracker open, wearable and modular for people, animals, assets and vehicles. Finally we market our product called Custodium tracker.</p>
<div>
<p>And why we developed “custom IoT”? The story is highly connected to our Custodium Tracker. We just wanted to solve some problems of our device and we do it!</p>
<h4>It was great! We create a integral solution at the same time as we developed a multifunctional device. </h4>

<p>Nuestro brillante dispositivo para el Internet de las Cosas (IoT)<br/></p>
<blockquote><i>Zaragoza, España, Tecnología</i></blockquote>
<p>En CUSTODIUM nos dedicamos a la localización y seguimiento GPS. Creamos un simple dispositivo y el software que le rodea para tener un completo sistema.<br/></p>
<p><b>4 problemas y una solución para muchos otros</b><br/></p>
<p>En CUSTODIUM nos dedicamos a la localización y seguimiento GPS durante el desarrollo de nuestros dispositivos y sistemas encontramos 4 problemas básicos:</p>
<p><br/><b>Localización sin cobertura:</b><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113361/files/20141223051533-sincobertura.png?1419340533"" src="""" style=""width: 148.023px; height: 167px;""/></p>En la localización en exteriores y espacios abiertos el GPS es de gran utilidad, pero todo esto se convierte en un problema cuando hablamos de espacios cubiertos o interiores donde la señal de GPS no tiene cobertura. También en el mundo rural cuando hablamos de localización en exteriores el GPS funciona perfectamente pero las redes de telefonía móvil no siempre tienen la cobertura adecuada.<br/>Así que para resolver estos problemas pensamos reforzar nuestro dispositivo con otras redes inalámbricas de amplio uso como pueden ser Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee ...<br/><br/>Por eso custom IoT incluye la posibilidad de usar estas redes para su comunicación. <b>¡SIN</b> <b>CABLES!</b><p><br/><b>Autosuficiencia.</b><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113362/files/20141223051615-iconmonstr-battery-11-icon-256.png?1419340575"" src="""" style=""width: 132px; height: 132px;""/></p>
<br/>Todas las aplicaciones móviles y en general los dispositivos electrónicos tienen la limitación de la duración de las baterías que mas tarde o mas temprano acaban agotandose y hay que recargar. En CUSTODIUM este problema es especialmente grave cuando se trata de aplicaciones que tienen que durar meses o años.<br/><br/>Para resolver este problema pensamos en incluir sistemas de recarga con energías renovables.<br/><br/>Por eso custom IoT incluye alimentación desde cualquier tipo de fuente que proporcione energía electrica, mini-solar, minieólica, dinamos.... <b>¡SOMOS VERDES!</b><br/><p><br/><b>Datos seguros:</b><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113363/files/20141223051715-File-Lock-icon.png?1419340635"" src="""" style=""width: 139px; height: 139px;""/></p>
<br/>Cuando estamos manejando datos de posición y otros asociados lo último que queremos es perderlos, así que hay que hacer copias de seguridad y saber donde tiene uno sus datos guardados para poder recuperarlos. En CUSTODIUM mandamos los datos a la nube para que siempre alla una copia de los mismos pero como ya hemos dicho no siempre hay una conexión disponible para mandarlos.<br/><br/>Para resolver este problema pensamos en incluir una tarjeta de memoria.<br/><br/>Por eso custom IoT incluye una tarjeta de memoria para guardar datos, no importa si son grandes o pequeños, lo importante es que estén guardados.<br/><br/><b>Siente y actúa:</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113364/files/20141223051808-feelandact.png?1419340688"" src="""" style=""width: 236px; height: 236px;""/><br/></p>
<p>Consideramos que la posición es algo importante, pero si le añadimos información procedente de sensores para dotarlos de movilidad seremos capaces de llegar más lejos en aplicaciones que son importantes para la salud, la seguridad en el trabajo, la información enriquecida del entorno.......</p>Para resolver este problema quisimos incluir un alto número de sensores y actuadores.<br/><br/>Por eso custom IoT incluye puertos de sensores y actuadores para poder usarse en una importante cantidad de escenarios diferentes.<br/><b>¡SIENTE Y ACTUA!<br/></b><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>¿Qué es custom IoT?</b></h2>

A Jose le gustaría tener localizado a su padre para poder ayudarle cuando fuera necesario. Él buscó un localizador GPS en el mercado, pero no había exactamente uno adaptado a los enfermos de Alzheimer. El problema principal era que los dispositivos de GPS eran en forma de pulsera o de colgante entonces es fácil que los pacientes se lo arrancaran. Después de todo esto, nosotros nos pusimos a desarrollar un GPS abierto, vestible y modular para personas, animales, mercancías y vehículos. Finalmente sacamos al mercado nuestro producto llamado Custodium tracker. <br/>¿Y por qué desarrollamos después el costum IoT ?

In
CUSTODIUM we work in location and GPS tracking. During the
development of our devices and systems, we found 4 basic problems:Out of range location


In outside location and open areas the
GPS is very useful but when we are in indoor areas the GPS signal
lose coverage. As well as, in rural area the GPS works properly,
however the mobile networks don´t have enough coverage.


So that's why we thought about
reinforce our device with wireless networks widely used such as
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee...


Custom IoT include the use of these
networks for WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONSelf-sufficiency


In general, the
electronic devices have a lack of self-sufficiency, that sooner or
later run out and it's necessary to recharge it. This matter
especially affects when it refers to apps that have to go on months
or years.


To solve this
problem we thought in adding recharge systems based on renowable
energies.


Therefore Custom
IoT could supply with any power source that provide electric energy,
mini-solar, micro-wind, dynamos... WE ARE GREEN!Secure data





When we operate
with data position the limit is to lose them, so that it's necessary
to make back-up copies knowing where the data are to recover them.


In Custodim we
send the data to the cloud to save copies but not always there is
connection to send it.


To solve it we
include a memory card. As a result, Custom IoT save the data, it
doesn't matter small or big data, the most important is to save data. SECURE DATA!

Feel & act

We
think the location is important, but we could go further away adding
information from sensors to use in health, work security, environment
information...

We
included a high number of useful sensors and actuators to solve the
problem.

Thus,
Custom IoT has serial ports of sensors and actuators that could be
useful in an important quantity of different scenes. FEEL
& ACT!
What is custom IoT? 

          

""Custom IoT"" is a Swiss knife device for the IoT.  Is a tailor-made device, achieved in a practical size to make mobility much easier. All the uses that you can imagine!
 www.customiot.info
Bits doing things:
bits & environment  


Related to environment, Custom IoT could be use as a smart garden and smart vegetable patch.

Also in meteorological office and other functions related with environmental protection: forecast and monitor the impact of natural aspects.

bits & home



Our Custom IoT device is very functional in home automation. Thanks to the sensors and actuators it could be very useful. 
Imagine uses such as communication, comfort, security, energy saving, etc. As well as with the IoT (Internet of Things) there are multiple aspects related to connectivity of assets.

bits & energy 




In Custodium we believe in green energies so that Custom IoT is powered by clean energy such as mini solar, micro-wind, micro-peltier. We refer to the efficiency and environmental compatibility of the power supply. 
This have a great potential especially in the field of electric mobility.

bits & health 



With reference to health, Custom IoT could be very helpful also. 
For example, it could monitor temperature of patients that are in quarantine because they may have ebola virus disease. It will send a constant signal to the hospital to control the patient from their home. Our team is working on it. 
As well as, it could has applications in e-health, Public health or in sports.

What we need and what you get?
We need 33.000€ to achieve our project.

With your support we will be able to produce 1000 units of our
development board. As well as, your help will allow us to improve our developments and then bring onto the market.
And if we achieve more funds?
If we get more we will dedicate the money to invest in improving the expansion device and of course to increase the value proposition of our products.
Perks












The story behind custodium:

All started the last year in a conversation between two friends, Ernesto and Jose who were talking about Jose's father, who suffer from Alzheimer. Jose wanted to have located his father in order to help him when it was necessary. He was looking for a GPS tracker in the market, but there wasn´t any suitable for Alzheimer´s sufferers. The main problem was that the GPS devices in the market were bracelet or necklace so it is easy to pull out it by Alzheimer's patients.
After that,we were developing a GPS tracker open, wearable and modular for people, animals, assets and vehicles. Finally we market our product called Custodium tracker.

And why we developed “custom IoT”? The story is highly connected to our Custodium Tracker. We just wanted to solve some problems of our device and we do it!
It was great! We create a integral solution at the same time as we developed a multifunctional device. 


Timeline: 


Our goal is to start selling
our devices in March 2015.


We start our crowdfunding campaign on 23 December. It will finish on 1 February 2015.


Competition of ideas:


On 2 of January we will launch a competition of ideas. Custom IoT could has multiple uses. We invited you to get free rein to your imagination. Propose us new ideas or applications. The perk will be a Custom IoT to test it. There will be four winners.

Bits doing things--¿Qué es lo que quieres que sea? 
Nuestro brillante dispositivo para el Internet de las Cosas (IoT)
Zaragoza, España, Tecnología
En CUSTODIUM nos dedicamos a la localización y seguimiento GPS. Creamos un simple dispositivo y el software que le rodea para tener un completo sistema.
4 problemas y una solución para muchos otros
En CUSTODIUM nos dedicamos a la localización y seguimiento GPS durante el desarrollo de nuestros dispositivos y sistemas encontramos 4 problemas básicos:
Localización sin cobertura:
En la localización en exteriores y espacios abiertos el GPS es de gran utilidad, pero todo esto se convierte en un problema cuando hablamos de espacios cubiertos o interiores donde la señal de GPS no tiene cobertura. También en el mundo rural cuando hablamos de localización en exteriores el GPS funciona perfectamente pero las redes de telefonía móvil no siempre tienen la cobertura adecuada.Así que para resolver estos problemas pensamos reforzar nuestro dispositivo con otras redes inalámbricas de amplio uso como pueden ser Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee ...Por eso custom IoT incluye la posibilidad de usar estas redes para su comunicación. ¡SIN CABLES!Autosuficiencia.

Todas las aplicaciones móviles y en general los dispositivos electrónicos tienen la limitación de la duración de las baterías que mas tarde o mas temprano acaban agotandose y hay que recargar. En CUSTODIUM este problema es especialmente grave cuando se trata de aplicaciones que tienen que durar meses o años.Para resolver este problema pensamos en incluir sistemas de recarga con energías renovables.Por eso custom IoT incluye alimentación desde cualquier tipo de fuente que proporcione energía electrica, mini-solar, minieólica, dinamos.... ¡SOMOS VERDES!Datos seguros:

Cuando estamos manejando datos de posición y otros asociados lo último que queremos es perderlos, así que hay que hacer copias de seguridad y saber donde tiene uno sus datos guardados para poder recuperarlos. En CUSTODIUM mandamos los datos a la nube para que siempre alla una copia de los mismos pero como ya hemos dicho no siempre hay una conexión disponible para mandarlos.Para resolver este problema pensamos en incluir una tarjeta de memoria.Por eso custom IoT incluye una tarjeta de memoria para guardar datos, no importa si son grandes o pequeños, lo importante es que estén guardados.Siente y actúa:
Consideramos que la posición es algo importante, pero si le añadimos información procedente de sensores para dotarlos de movilidad seremos capaces de llegar más lejos en aplicaciones que son importantes para la salud, la seguridad en el trabajo, la información enriquecida del entorno.......Para resolver este problema quisimos incluir un alto número de sensores y actuadores.Por eso custom IoT incluye puertos de sensores y actuadores para poder usarse en una importante cantidad de escenarios diferentes.¡SIENTE Y ACTUA!
¿Qué es custom IoT?

          ""Custom IoT"" es un dispositivo para IoT (Internet de las cosas). Está hecho a medida, con tecnología española y en un tamaño muy práctico para facilitar la movilidad. Puede tener tantos usos como puedas imaginar.

The children that quietly languished in the shadows, hungry and slowly dropping out of school, one by one. The children of Pantanal are the ones that tourists see as annoying street beggars or sad, hopeless causes. But they are not hopeless. They are beautiful souls that desire so much to learn. They are bright children that line up and beg for homework. They are the children that plead for just one more banana from school, because they don’t know when they will be able to eat again. But when they have food and love, they dance and laugh and sing like all the other children across the world. These are the children that we have sworn to never let fall in the shadows ever again.” Help us help them. For every $9 donation, we will give a solar-powered lamp to a child in Pantanal. Our goal is to donate 200 lamps, one for every student at Education Plus Nicaragua in Pantanal, Nicaragua. 
Esperanza Market  
Esperanza means Hope in Spanish. The Esperanza Market was born from the idea that businesses can do better. That businesses can align themselves with a deeper mission than maximizing profits. That businesses can both provide high-quality products and services and at the same time help make the world a better place to live.

We will do that in two ways. First, starting in Nicaragua, we will search markets and craft fairs to find and establish relationships directly with artisans. By creating an online marketplace for their handmade products, we are providing the under- and unemployed artisans, mostly women, with an opportunity to earn vital income in poverty-stricken parts of Latin America.  The second part of the market is donating solar-powered lamps to students who live without electricity. One-third of the Nicaraguan population lives without reliable access to electricity. The Esperanza Market will donate a solar-powered light to students who live in homes without access to reliable electricity. Our first giving partner will be Education Plus Nicaragua, a nonprofit that provides free education and food to the children of the Pantanal Barrio outside of Granada, Nicaragua. The first 200 lights will be donated to these students at Education Plus Nicaragua.The Pantanal barrio was founded in 1992 with no urban planning as a place for natural disaster refugees from other parts of Nicaragua. Since then, it has grown to approximately 13,000 residents, 8,000 of which are children. Many of the homes are wired for electricity, however, families can not afford to actually use it.Despite their living conditions, the students at Education Plus Nicaragua are happy, motivated and hopeful for a better future.

How MobiCard got started.</strong></u></p><p>Hi,</p><p>My name is Rob Hunt, I’m the founder and president of MobiCard USA INC. I get asked why I started MobiCard, well to answer this I’ll need to tell you a little bit about how I grew up.</p><p>When I was 12 my father broke his neck, as you can imagine, it had quite the impact on our family finances. To say the least, we all had to pitch in. I really liked being in sports, but it took money to be in sports, particularly when it came to equipment. This is where the Duct Tape comes into play!</p><p>Duct Tape is truly “the handyman’s secret weapon”! We used Duct Tape to repair, improvise, and create equipment for sports. When it came to my “Old Pair of Shoes”, Duct Tape was used to wrap around them to keep them together, smooth out the tread, and make it possible for me to wrestle. I could have very well ended up on the streets, or could have turned to crime, and drugs… Sports, and Duct Tape won!</p><p>I started collage, got married, and started my first business when I was 19. Fast forwarding to now, I have been a businessman for over 25 years. During my carrier I have been in Retail, Service, and Marketing, along with being an inventor holding a major patent, and working on others.</p><p>Smartphones came into the picture! In 2013 I was sitting in my office thinking about what I wanted to do, regarding future ideas, and projects. I’ve always wanted to make a difference in the lives of others, so I began working on a way for low income kids to be able to generate income, and “pay it forward” to the next generations to come… This is where MobiCard was born!</p><p>In creating MobiCard, I wanted everyone to win! With my business, and marketing background, I knew what businesses needed to succeed, and thought that if I can create a win for Businesses, a win for fundraisers, a win for consumers, and a win for the community…. It would be a huge success!</p><p>We now have the balance for everyone! In January of 2016, I thought, why just limit this to kids? Why don’t we let everyone participate? Doesn’t it help kids if we help their mom, or dad, or other members of the family? Doesn’t it help the kids if we help churches, charities, organizations….

<h3>Skafferiet flyttar och fortsätter att växa!</h3>
<p>Skafferiet Västerås är en förpackningsfri butik, det innebär kort och gott att våra produkter säljs utan förpackningar! Du tar med dig dina egna behållare - eller köper glasburkar/flaskor hos oss -  och fyller på dem med ekologiska varor i vårat specialdesignade lösviktssystem. Ett annat sätt att handla på helt enkelt!</p>
<p>Skafferiet Västerås kommer inom en snar framtid att flytta till nya lokaler hos Saluhallen Slakteriet. Vi ser det som en fantastisk möjlighet att bli en del av denna samling butiker och matställen som erbjuder lokala råvaror och fantastiska gourmetupplevelser med ett stort fokus på hållbarhet. I samband med detta finns det dessvärre även andra faktorer som sträcker sig utom vår makt och leder till att vi efter en sådan kort tid redan behöver flytta. </p>
<p>En så pass tidig flytt och renovering av ytterligare en lokal var inte något vi räknat med och som ett nystartat, privatägt företag i startgroparna av sin resa innebär det en tuff situation ekonomiskt för oss. Vi har därför valt att starta en crowdfunding kampanj för att göra det  lättare för oss att kunna hantera de kostnader som denna flytt innebär.</p>
<p>Sedan starten har vi sett en stadig, positiv trend både vad gäller antalet kunder som handlar hos oss och omsättningen i butiken. Det går kanske inte så snabbt som vi hade velat, men det går framåt. Detta motiverar oss att fortsätta att växa som företag och vi ser goda möjligheter att hjälpa till att sätta Västerås på kartan som en innovativ stad som tar emot och huserar hållbara koncept som detta!</p>
<h3>Vad kommer pengarna att användas till?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>De pengar som samlas in kommer att användas till följande:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kostnader direkt relaterade till flytten av butiken vilket inkluderar flyttbil, ned och uppmontering av vårat specialdesignade lösviktssystem och flyttlådor.</li>
<li>Kostnader för renoveringen och iordningställandet av vår nya lokal på Saluhallen Slakteriet.</li>
<li>Kostnaderna för en marknadsföringskampanj av vår butik i dess nya lokaler för att sprida ordet om var vi flyttar och vad vi erbjuder.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Vill du hjälpa oss att fortsätta växa i våra nya lokaler?</h3></div><div>
<p>Om du brinner för det vi gör och den förändring som vi kämpar för att få igenom vad gäller hållbar tillverkning och konsumtion av ekologiska och förpackningsfria livsmedel så har du nu en chans att direkt stödja oss i vår största utmaning hittills! Även små bidrag gör skillnad så känn inte någon press att skänka en stor summa, vi uppskattar allt stöd oavsett storleken på ditt bidrag!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>----ENGLISH----</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Skafferiet is moving and continues to grow!</h3>
<p>Skafferiet Västerås is a zero waste shop, meaning our products are sold package-free! Bring your own containers - or buy glas jars/bottles at the shop - and fill them with organic produce from our bulk system especially designed for zero waste shopping. Simply put, a different way of shopping!</p>
<p>Skafferiet Västerås will shortly be moving to its new premises at Saluhallen Slakteriet. We see this as a great opportunity to become a part of this collection of shops and eateries offering local produce and fantastic gourmet experiences with a strong focus on sustainability. In connection with this there are also unfortunately other factors beyond our control which leads us to move from our current place after such a short amount of time. </p>
<p>Such an early move and renovation of another place for our shop was not something we had planned and as a private, newly opened business it puts us in a rather tough economic situation.

<p>Since opening on day one we have seen a gradual, positive increase in customers and revenue.

<p>The money collected from this campaign will be used for the following causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs directly associated with the move to our new place in Saluhallen including the assembly of our special bulk units, hiring a truck/car for the move and moving boxes.</li>
<li>Costs directly associated with renovating and getting our new space ready for the shop.</li>
<li>Costs directly associated with marketing campaigns for our shop on its new premises and for its continued growth in Västerås.</li>

<p>If you love what we do and the changes that we are fighting to make regarding sustainable production and consumption of organic and package-free products, here is your chance to make a direct contribution to our biggest challenge yet! Even small contributions are a big help and are very much appreciated so don’t feel pressured to donate more than you can spare!</p>
</div></div>","Skafferiet flyttar och fortsätter att växa!
Skafferiet Västerås är en förpackningsfri butik, det innebär kort och gott att våra produkter säljs utan förpackningar! Du tar med dig dina egna behållare - eller köper glasburkar/flaskor hos oss -  och fyller på dem med ekologiska varor i vårat specialdesignade lösviktssystem. Ett annat sätt att handla på helt enkelt!
Skafferiet Västerås kommer inom en snar framtid att flytta till nya lokaler hos Saluhallen Slakteriet. Vi ser det som en fantastisk möjlighet att bli en del av denna samling butiker och matställen som erbjuder lokala råvaror och fantastiska gourmetupplevelser med ett stort fokus på hållbarhet. I samband med detta finns det dessvärre även andra faktorer som sträcker sig utom vår makt och leder till att vi efter en sådan kort tid redan behöver flytta. 
En så pass tidig flytt och renovering av ytterligare en lokal var inte något vi räknat med och som ett nystartat, privatägt företag i startgroparna av sin resa innebär det en tuff situation ekonomiskt för oss. Vi har därför valt att starta en crowdfunding kampanj för att göra det  lättare för oss att kunna hantera de kostnader som denna flytt innebär.
Sedan starten har vi sett en stadig, positiv trend både vad gäller antalet kunder som handlar hos oss och omsättningen i butiken. Det går kanske inte så snabbt som vi hade velat, men det går framåt. Detta motiverar oss att fortsätta att växa som företag och vi ser goda möjligheter att hjälpa till att sätta Västerås på kartan som en innovativ stad som tar emot och huserar hållbara koncept som detta!
Vad kommer pengarna att användas till?

De pengar som samlas in kommer att användas till följande:

Kostnader direkt relaterade till flytten av butiken vilket inkluderar flyttbil, ned och uppmontering av vårat specialdesignade lösviktssystem och flyttlådor.
Kostnader för renoveringen och iordningställandet av vår nya lokal på Saluhallen Slakteriet.
Kostnaderna för en marknadsföringskampanj av vår butik i dess nya lokaler för att sprida ordet om var vi flyttar och vad vi erbjuder.

Vill du hjälpa oss att fortsätta växa i våra nya lokaler?
Om du brinner för det vi gör och den förändring som vi kämpar för att få igenom vad gäller hållbar tillverkning och konsumtion av ekologiska och förpackningsfria livsmedel så har du nu en chans att direkt stödja oss i vår största utmaning hittills! Även små bidrag gör skillnad så känn inte någon press att skänka en stor summa, vi uppskattar allt stöd oavsett storleken på ditt bidrag!
 
----ENGLISH----
 
Skafferiet is moving and continues to grow!
Skafferiet Västerås is a zero waste shop, meaning our products are sold package-free! Bring your own containers - or buy glas jars/bottles at the shop - and fill them with organic produce from our bulk system especially designed for zero waste shopping. Simply put, a different way of shopping!
Skafferiet Västerås will shortly be moving to its new premises at Saluhallen Slakteriet. We see this as a great opportunity to become a part of this collection of shops and eateries offering local produce and fantastic gourmet experiences with a strong focus on sustainability. In connection with this there are also unfortunately other factors beyond our control which leads us to move from our current place after such a short amount of time. 
Such an early move and renovation of another place for our shop was not something we had planned and as a private, newly opened business it puts us in a rather tough economic situation. That is why we have decided to launch this crowdfunding campaign in order to make it easier for us to cope with the extra costs related to the move.
Since opening on day one we have seen a gradual, positive increase in customers and revenue. It might not be increasing as fast as we'd like but it is nonetheless going forward from day to day which motivates us to keep growing as a company and also putting Västerås on the map as a city that welcomes sustainable concepts such as our shop!
What will the funds be used for?
The money collected from this campaign will be used for the following causes:

Costs directly associated with the move to our new place in Saluhallen including the assembly of our special bulk units, hiring a truck/car for the move and moving boxes.
Costs directly associated with renovating and getting our new space ready for the shop.
Costs directly associated with marketing campaigns for our shop on its new premises and for its continued growth in Västerås.

Do you want to help us to keep growing in our new premises at Saluhallen?

<h3>The Impact &amp; Risks</h3>

Survival Gear while doing it.</p>

Since business has slowed down so dramatically, we have had to dip into what small cash savings we have just to stay open.  We can't take many more months like this.  We are looking to raise enough funds to weather the A.R.T. storm.  The risk here is that even with a community sourced injection of capital, the construction has no end in sight and we still may have to consider closing.  We're willing to take that risk and get you some cool A.R.T. Survival Gear while doing it.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  
Business has been so slow it gets lonely sometimes. Stop in the shop and say hi.  Maybe you'll find something you like :)  It's easiest to use Coal or Lead and come in through the back way on Edith.
Also, you can use the Indiegogo share buttons to spread the word far and wide.
We're located at 514 Central Ave. SE, Albuquerque, NM 87102

The initial Pi Pan is designed to fit a 14” or 16” pizza, the most common sizes for take-out and delivery. The geometries of the design are easily extendable to different sizes. Aluminum and stainless steel pans are widely used in pizza operations so there is already a familiarity of use for operators and consumers.</span>

</div></div>","Hi IndieGoGo! Thanks for checking out our campaign!  Good News Reuse™ has created the first ever reusable pizza box made from sustainable materials. We call it the Pi Pan. Our goal is to replace the 3 billion cardboard pizza boxes used each year with the Pi Pan. It's a lofty goal so we need to get started now.

Please watch our video and help us reach our target by clicking the ""CONTRIBUTE NOW"" button to the right. If you'd like to learn more see our FAQs below. 




FAQs:What is the Pi Pan made of?


The Pi Pan is made of thin commercial food grade stainless steel, as thin as a reusable water bottle. It is BPA-free and does not contain other unhealthy chemicals. How long does a Pi Pan last?Stainless steel lasts forever but we modestly claim 1,000+ uses. The Pi Pan is recyclable at any point in its lifetime.Tell me more about it...The Pi Pan has an innovative yet timeless design. Advanced engineering ensures that the reusable Pi Pan is lightweight yet strong, keeps pizzas hotter for longer, and is easy to clean. The initial Pi Pan is designed to fit a 14” or 16” pizza, the most common sizes for take-out and delivery. The geometries of the design are easily extendable to different sizes. Aluminum and stainless steel pans are widely used in pizza operations so there is already a familiarity of use for operators and consumers.



Does the Pi Pan require assembly?Unlike a traditional cardboard pizza box, there is no assembly required. What are some of the benefits of the Pi Pan?
Reusable - lasts forever
Pays for itself after 30 uses in businesses with reoccurring deliveries
Delivers a hotter, crispier, tastier pizza - no cardboard taste
Adapts easily into existing food operations
Attractive, simple, lasting design
Environmental contribution and statement
BPA-free, with no other unhealthy chemicals

How much will the Pi Pan cost?For commercial food operators, we plan to sell the Pi Pan for $15 to $20 at volume production (the average cost of a cardboard pizza box is $0.50). For retail customers, we plan to sell the Pi Pan for $34.95. Why are you first promoting the Pi Pan for use at pizzerias and food companies instead of to individual consumers?  

We are targeting food service companies who make reoccurring deliveries to schools and businesses because we think we can make the quickest environmental impact here. Schools are especially important to us because kids learn by doing.


Will you sell Pi Pans to individuals?


Ultimately we want all pizza lovers to have a reusable Pi Pan. Individual Pi Pans will be available on our website soon. 


Could I use a Pi Pan at home? Yes. There are several home uses. 

Transport your pizza from your local pizzeria, saving a cardboard box. It’s just like bringing in your own reusable shopping bag.


Reheat your pizza on the Pi Pan bottom. 


Serve your pizza on the Pi Pan, just as if you were eating in a pizzeria. 


Cleaning is easy. Just use soap, water, and a gentle scrub brush as needed. For businesses, it is commercial dishwasher safe.




A cardboard pizza box works perfectly well. Why do we need a reusable one?It is cheaper, healthier, more sustainable and the pizza tastes better.Most people are surprised to learn that pizza boxes are not recyclable. People also don’t realize that recycled cardboard contains BPAs.Pizza box waste impacts the environment negatively in three ways:
Destruction of trees and other environmental resources;
Excessive waste in our landfills and/or contamination of community recycling projects, as food contaminated containers are not recyclable or compostable in most communities;
Perpetuation of the single-use mentality among consumers, particularly school age children.

Is the Pi Pan patented? Yes we have a provisional patent. 



The $100+ perks include MiiR reusable water bottles. What is your connection to MiiR?

Good News Reuse™ has partnered with MiiR on their one4one initiative. This means that for every MiiR/Good News Reuse™ reusable water bottle purchased, you will be providing one deserving person with clean water for an entire year.

Why don't you offer the Pi Pan as a perk?
We had hoped to offer the Pi Pan as a perk, but decided to seek just enough money to manufacturer the prototype and samples for potential businesses. Once we are up and running, all IndieGoGo supporters will have the opportunity to purchase the first Pi Pans at discounted prices.

What will the money from IndieGoGo be used for?


Produce the tooling dies for the top and bottom of the Pi Pan
Make samples for marketing and sales 
Complete all product and engineering tests for product launch



The funding goal of $70,000 was determined after receiving several quotes from manufacturers. If we meet this goal, we will have a finished prototype plus Pi Pan samples for potential customers. Based on manufacturers' timetables, the Pi Pan would be available within 6 months.



$70,000, less IndieGoGo fees, payment processing fees and perks, is the amount needed for the first phase of our business plan. If we receive more than $70,000, we will produce more samples and build a team to launch the Pi Pan. The more money we receive, the more significant impact we can make.





We want to express our sincere gratitude in advance for your contribution to this new venture. If successfully funded, we will hit the ground running and keep you in the loop throughout the process. If we don't reach our goal, these funds will be used towards the company's second revolutionary reusable concept, currently under development.






What is Good News Reuse™? 



Good News Reuse™ is a start-up dedicated to reducing waste in the food and beverage industry. We decided to create the Pi Pan after discovering that Americans throw away 3 billion single-use cardboard pizza boxes every year. Ultimately we want to introduce other reusable concepts to replace the vast amount of single-use containers that crowd our landfills. 



Once profitable Good News Reuse™ will donate at least 1% of annual sales to nonprofits working to protect our environment and promote environmental awareness. In the meantime, our way of helping is by partnering with MiiR on their one4one water initiative.



Who are the creators of Good News Reuse™? 



Susan is a die-hard foodie and longtime environmentalist in Mill Valley, California. She is the creative force behind Good News Reuse™. With broad experience in all facets of food service, she is fully dedicated to providing reusable sustainable solutions to the excessive waste in the industry. Jeff is the key strategist for Good News Reuse™. He loves food and technology and is a consumer products guru. He hails from San Francisco and has held executive positions with Fortune 100 companies and start-ups, from semi-conductors to LED lighting. 


Together, Susan and Jeff have combined their talents to develop Good News Reuse™ and the Pi Pan.




How can I help?

93% of our population eats pizza once a month. Every take-out pizza comes in a cardboard box and most end up in our landfills.............3 billion in the USA alone, every year. 
 

The dream of Good News Reuse™ is to halt this wasteful practice. So far we have been entirely self-funded, but now we need your help to produce and bring the Pi Pan to market. We hope you are inspired by Good News Reuse™ and the Pi Pan.

<p> </p>
<p>Despite her fear of the financial uncertainty, Brenda continued with her treatments at the hospital for 3 weeks—all away from her precious family.  This was in late October.  While recuperating at home, she was looking forward to returning to work so that she could continue to provide the financial support to the family with the upcoming holiday season.  She initially was given notice to return to work early this month, December 2012.  Prior to coming back to work, she needed to see the doctors again to release her only to find out that she had an aneurism in her heart and that she was bleeding in that area.  Needless to say, she immediately underwent open heart surgery.  Although Brenda is back at home, she has very limited mobility.  She shares with us the scar she received from the surgery which stems from the right side of her neck to her belly button and another scar of the same length parallel to this on the left.  Because of her lack of mobility, Brenda is practically bed-ridden.  She labors to do everything including talking.  It goes without saying, she is unable to drive to work, much less work.  Because the holidays are coming and because she will be out of work for a minimum of three (3) months, I am appealing to your sense of humanity and spirit of giving in this season to help out this family.  The funds raised will be to assist her in maintaining their household for the next three months.  I am seeking enough funds for the members of her household to be able to live on for the next three months estimated at $1000 per person.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please join me in showing random acts of kindness to this family who needs us most in this very trying time.  My connection to this cause and to Brenda:  she is currently my boss where I work on a part-time basis.  She took a chance in hiring me and giving me the opportunity to provide for my own family.  With your help, I can return the excellent deed she did for me.  Good deeds have been ingrained in me since I was a child, and I know many of you have that same sense of community and giving.  So let’s all come together and help Brenda win this battle. </p></div>","Imagine one 6:00 a.m. heading to work from your home which is about a 2 hour drive away and realizing that you’re not feeling as pep as you normally are.  Despite this gnawing feeling, you tough it out anyway.  As the day progressed, the feeling of malaise worsened.  Then you just pass out.  This happened to my boss, Brenda, at work at the Unleashed in Long Beach, CA.  She could not recall passing out but recalled finding herself in the ICU not aware for what reason.  She was told that she was having issues with her heart and kidneys and would have to stay in the hospital until they could determine the nature of the problem.  The only things that Brenda could think about were her five kids at home which again was at least a 2 hour drive back.  There was also her disabled boyfriend who, just two months back, was in a serious car accident and was left debilitated and could not work.  Because Brenda is the sole earner for this family of seven (four boys, one girl, her boyfriend and herself), her thoughts immediately were of the financial impact this hospital stay would create in their already surmounting financial decline.

</h2>
<p>  </p>
<p>Here, we’re looking for the people who love to eat and love to cook… but don’t want to learn cooking the way your grandma did.</p>
<p>The vision began with Waldemar in cooking school way back in Santa Barbara in the early 2000’s. Now fast-forward a decade, and his dream for his own commercial kitchen for cooking classes, catering and a private dinner club is coming alive.</p>
<p>See, we think cooking out of a recipe book isn’t really that interesting. In fact, it’s kind of messy – ever wanted to rip out that page or laminate it for fear of food (oh, the horrors!) stains on it? Yeah. <br/><br/>How about sitting in front of your TV watching the Food Network, wondering why it’s so damn easy for Cute Chef to cook that pasta dish with commercials in between, and not even break a sweat?</p>
<p>Yeah. Cooking bites sometimes. Or sometimes you’re just lazy and don’t feel like cooking. That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>The Entrée-Sized Version of Our Story:</strong> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
</h2>
<p>We want to meet you… if you’re the kind of person who craves learning to cook in a fun way. An easy way. Where your cooking class is easy to get to (think 5 minutes from downtown Vancouver), parking is free, your chef is easy to follow and talk to, and what happens when you’re well fed and grooving to music? You even learn something along the way! </p>
<p>Waldemar’s run enough cooking classes over the past number of years to know that nobody likes a quiet, awkward cooking class where you feel like the high school nerd.</p>
<p>We want you to fall in love with the reason why you’re alive. Hint - no, it’s not processed junk food – it’s <em>real </em>food that came from the ground, the farm and made it to your table.</p>
<p>We’re talking about <strong>food appreciation.</strong> Learn about all the ways you can learn to cook that seafood, bring the recipes home and enjoy the awe and taste sensations of “Whoa…I really made THAT!”</p>
<p>Because food is so much more than nuking a frozen dinner, or making something that makes you bored to tears because you’ve had it the last ten weekends in a row.</p>
<p>Food is about passion.</p>
<p>Sharing stories over a glass of wine or beer and laughing with your friends.</p>
<p>It’s about bringing your friends along TO the class you’re going to take, or ordering dinner and watching it cooked live in front of you.</p>
<p>If you think cooking is boring, or that it’s just your girlfriend’s job…think again. Get out of your granny mentality.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Here’s the tour of the plans for our kitchen. What’s happening:<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Cooking Classes <br/></strong><br/>Here, everybody gets to eat a full-course dinner in every class they sign up for.</p>
<p>Learn to cook with 15 types of seafood in an evening. If you’re horrible with your knife skills, come learn how to chop like a Top Chef.</p>
<p>During the class, come in and have appies.  Enjoy the music. Have a beverage.  Joke around with the chef, roll out the dough, talk about your first burned college dorm meal. Why not? Because it’s going to be that kind of space.</p>
<p>Forget the chef in the stiff white hat… we’ll be bringing in Executive Chefs from the best restaurants around town and around the world who want to joke around and have fun with their audience.</p>
<p>Our classes are semi-interactive – meaning that you get to volunteer if you’re super-keen, but if you’re shy that doesn’t mean you don’t get to eat.</p>
<p>Here…everyone eats!</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Private Catering</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Our philosophy is that you’ll hire us to work hard at your evening, so you don’t have to. Waldemar has been in the private catering industry for over 10 years, and he knows that the client deserves to enjoy their evening as much as the guests they’ve invited – from the start to finish, until the last guest tips his hat out the door.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Our catering menu selections are adapted to your evening and are designed to showcase the chef’s culinary skill while providing maximum visuals for your guests. Cooking with fire? Check. Beautiful food plated in front of your eyes? Check. It’s fun food entertainment.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>In-House Catering for Meetings &amp; Private Events </strong></p>
<p>Our lounge and open kitchen space is built for a small group of people (25-40) looking for an evening meeting space with catered food going for a reasonable rate. </p>
<p><strong><br/>Private dinner club </strong></p>
<p>We’re also going to be launching an exclusive dinner night on Fridays. Our sittings will be for 20 at a time, so it’s nice and cozy. We have a select menu for you to choose from, for everyone from carnivores to vegetarians. </p>
<p>What’s on course? It’s going to be one price, all-inclusive for an appetizer, complementary beverage, entrée, and dessert.</p>
<p>Check out the live music, order your food and watch it cooked right in front of you. You’ll know it’s stunningly fresh, clean and might learn a few cooking secrets along the way.</p>

<h2>Geek Brew Cafe needs your help to open-</h2>
<p>WE DO NOT NEED THE 10,000 TO OPEN. Our down payment to get things MOBILE will be about 6,000 dollars. We need about half that in contributions to get Geek Brew off the ground.</p>
<p>      We want to be open to provide great things to the community, including:  great coffee with organic syrups and sugars; gluten free, vegetarian and organic pastries; fair trade and organic chocolate bars and teas; and healthy energy drink options, all in recyclable and compostable materials for your drive-thru or walk in needs. </p>
<p>      It doesn’t stop here! Helping us open Geek Brew Cafe in this coffee stand will also be helping us open a full cafe in the future; for the community, by the community and in the community. We want this cafe to have the space and capacity for seating and serving, concerts, open mic nights, group meetings and similar events. In this way we will draw in and maintain a larger stakeholder base, for whom we envision Geek Brew Cafe as a gathering point and social hub. We plan to provide a spiritual gift shop inside of this bigger facility, a meeting space open to community members, a gamer room that can satisfy our geeky gamer needs, and a self-sustaining orchard/garden, maintained by and for the benefit of community members. These are just few of the things that our dream for Geek Brew can become. </p>
<p>You can be a part of that dream by helping us open our doors. </p>
<h3><strong><span>Let's Break It Down-</span></strong></h3>
<p>We have a bank who is willing to fund us, but the days of funding with no down payment are over. We need to put 6 down to be able to open our doors. Both Kat and I are investing about half of that amount and we need the community to help us come up with the rest (and get some perks in the process!).</p>
<p>We will use this money for:</p>
<p>Down payment on the loan that will pay for the stand in which Geek Brew Cafe will reside. </p>
<p>What will we do without the money from the community?</p>
<p>We will continue to save our money to gather enough for a down payment for a loan to open business. (which might take a very long time)</p>
<p>What would we do with more than the 6k we are hoping to fundraise? </p>
<p>We would put more money as a down payment, or use some as a cushion once our doors are open to make it through the early stages when most businesses are 'in the red'. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span>What your Contribution Will Do-</span></strong></h3>
<p>Your contribution will make it possible to open Geek Brew Cafe. It will make it possible to provide:  healthy pastries made by local community members; great coffee (and amazing discounts) by a well known and preferred local roaster; jobs for community members that wouldn't fit a normal barista ideal (our Geek Brew employees will be guys and girls with great passion, flair, and intellect that fit all different cultural varieties); and a place to connect with all things in the community. For instance, Geek Brew, even in our small coffee stand form, will be showcasing community members' artwork on our walls for sale and for pleasure. We will be selling vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free pastries made by local community members, making no money off of their products so that they can retain the full profit. We will keep a community message board that will contain announcements, goods and services that people in the community need or have so that they can connect with others in the community who might wish to exchange services. These are only a few community benefits that we will offer at our coffee stand; and many, many more that we can offer when we expand to the Cafe. </p>

<h4>What we need:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Capacity!</strong>  We need a 2nd machine to double our productivity and have a back-up option should our only hard-working machine ever need service. It's a necessary purchase to take Tara's Organic Ice Cream to the next level.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobility!</strong>   We need a fuel-efficient, dedicated delivery vehicle to be able to service the growing wholesale business as well as support our 3rd shop opening this summer in Pleasanton CA!</li>

<p>With your help, we can make more ice cream and spread the Organic Ice Cream Love. Any amount helps! We know that we are asking a lot! It's not easy to ask, but these items are very expensive. So with that in mind, please help us spread the word, and share this with your family and friends.</p>

<p>Tara's Organic Ice Cream is different.  It is made in small batches with fresh, organic ingredients with no artificial flavorings or stabilizers.  Bold flavors with a less-sweet flavor profile let the true flavors of fresh herbs, spices and fresh ingredients dominate.  TOIC has created <a href=""http://www.tarasorganic.com/ice-cream/flavors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">130+ different unique organic flavors</a>, including specialized offerings for our gluten-free and diabetic customers.</p>

Tara's Organic Ice Cream is growing!
We currently have scoop shops in Berkeley and Oakland CA and sell pints in 30+ natural grocery stores in California.  We are receiving inquiries from shops and restaurants that want to offer our ice cream to their customers and customers who want to see our ice cream in their local grocery stores PLUS we are working on opening a third shop in Pleasenton CA but need your help to get there.  We are running on a bootstrap budget with only 1 machine that produces all of this product in small batches of 2 or 3 gallons at a time and making all the deliveries with our own personal vehicles.
What we need:


Capacity!  We need a 2nd machine to double our productivity and have a back-up option should our only hard-working machine ever need service. It's a necessary purchase to take Tara's Organic Ice Cream to the next level.

Mobility!   We need a fuel-efficient, dedicated delivery vehicle to be able to service the growing wholesale business as well as support our 3rd shop opening this summer in Pleasanton CA!
Why Give?

You love artisanal ice cream (who doesn't?)
You love businesses committed to local and organic food
You love businesses committed to green and sustainable practices
You want to see more TOIC in Bay Area grocery stores
You want a TOIC scoop shop in Pleasenton CA
You feel and want to help spread the organic ice cream love
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute monetarily, you can help by spreading the word on your FB page and just generally make some noise about our campaign! It's a solid endeavor and Tara's Organic Ice Cream is committed to the Bay Area community, our environment and organic, sustainable living!

With your help, we can make more ice cream and spread the Organic Ice Cream Love. Any amount helps! We know that we are asking a lot! It's not easy to ask, but these items are very expensive. So with that in mind, please help us spread the word, and share this with your family and friends.
Although we cannot promise you enlightenment for your generosity, we can give you kickbacks for your good Karma.  Your good deeds will be recognized. We are eternally grateful for your support, love, and love of Organic Ice Cream!
THANK YOU. Sincerely and dearly, Tara, Raciel, and the entire Tara's Organic Ice Cream team!www.tarasorganic.com
More About TOIC
Tara's Organic Ice Cream is different.  It is made in small batches with fresh, organic ingredients with no artificial flavorings or stabilizers.  Bold flavors with a less-sweet flavor profile let the true flavors of fresh herbs, spices and fresh ingredients dominate.  TOIC has created 130+ different unique organic flavors, including specialized offerings for our gluten-free and diabetic customers.

<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>I have been given an incredible opportunity to farm on a beautiful piece of land in Almonte, outside of Ottawa, Ontario. This community is excited to eat local food, and I am excited to grow it.</p>
<p>Much of my work has been guided by my interest in how food makes its way from farm to fork.  My first experience farming in Italy ignited a deep passion for righting the path of our food system, and connecting people to the sources of their food.  I have farmed in Connecticut, and taught at The Edible Schoolyard in Berkeley CA.  In Michigan, I managed a year-round CSA at Michigan State University's Student Organic Farm, managed MSU's Organic Farmer Training Program, and consulted with Ann Arbor's Parks &amp; Recreation Commission to create a sustainable, productive, educational, and community-focused farm in a city park.</p>
<p>I believe that these experiences position me well to start my own farm, and to manage an educational farming program. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where Will the Money Go?</h3>
<p>Take a look at how your donations can be used:</p>
<p>$10: A harvest knife</p>
<p>$50: Trellising supplies for growing heirloom tomatoes</p>
<p>$250:  A tool that efficiently seeds salad greens</p>
<p>$500: Compost for soil fertility management</p>
<p>$750: Supplies for pest management and irrigation </p>
<p>$1,000:  Hand tools for cultivating, weeding, and harvesting</p>
<p>$10,000: A deer fence that will allow for a significant increase in production, as well as wages for two local youth</p>
<p>$25,000: Larger quantities of the supplies/tools listed above, as well as wages for more employees, allowing us to increase production</p>
<p>Anything beyond this will be used to create a vibrant educational farming program where local youth learn leadership and farming skills while providing wholesome food to their community.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you have ever seen the look on a kid's face when he unearths a potato or when she sees that a planted seed has sprouted, you know that connecting people to the sources of their food is not a small thing.   Imagine if everyone knew their farmers, just as they know their doctors, dentists, lawyers and plumbers.  The world would be a different place.</p>
<p>Initially, the farm will provide food to the community and local restaurants.  Over time, the educational program will teach young people where food comes from, provide them with meaningful work, and build community. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had a friend from San Antonio who flew to Dallas to have her face and neck lift. Her plastic surgeon had an out of town package with a 4-5 star hotel for her to recover in for about 3days. She had to hire a nurse for the three days which includes room and board. My friend had to buy a lazyboy recliner because she had to lay at an angle, after this she donated the recliner to the hotel for the next patient.</p>
<p>The problem in the US is there are no full facilities to accommodate the high demand of medical/wellness tourism. The Revivify3 concept will provide an outlet for the demand by combines traditional spa treatments with clinically proven surgical and non-surgical skin and body rejuvenation procedures, anti-aging, preventive medicine, medical/wellness tourism, education &amp; hospitality with superior service and privacy.</p>
<p>Revivify3 is to impart new life, energy, and spirit by offering the best plastic surgery, intergrated wellness center, spa, luxury suites, gourmet' dinning.</p>
<p>The best part is we will have Doctors, RN's, and Profesional staff working at our medical/wellness Resort. So no buying extra things, hiring extra personal nurses or instructors for the spa &amp; fitness center,we will have all that is needed plus all the educational tools to get or keep your healthy lifestyle. </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>

This will get us started putting together Revivify3 medical / wellness Resort. Also with this money I will be hiring some key employees to help with the organization of the Resort. When we are ready to open we will have hired at least 50 people and introduced medical tourism in the United States. This type of resort will be first to market. How exciting to know you have help create a dream come true and put the USA on the map for Medical Tourism.  Can you help me?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a team of designers, landscape architects, and engineers from Hyphae Design Laboratory and Urban Biofilter in Oakland, CA who came together outside of work hours to prototype a piece of urban infrastructure that could improve the lives of San Francisco residents.</p>
<p><em>The result?</em> <strong>P</strong>Planter.</p>
<p><em>The motivation?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrating San Francisco’s progression towards mobile and outdoor services including food trucks, beer gardens, and parklets by providing a place for people to relieve themselves while being outside!</li>
<li>Turning a nuisance (public urination) into a nutrient for hungry bamboo biofilters</li>
<li>Experimenting with smart urban infrastructure that tracks usage + includes a mobile app for user feedback to inform future design solutions! </li>
</ul>
<p><em>The design?</em></p>
<p><span><strong>P</strong>Planter is a rapidly deployable, reconfigurable public urinal and sink that uses modular bamboo biofilters to treat urine and wastewater. A network of sensors for automated monitoring and a responsive web application enable public feedback and participation in the design of future iterations.</span></p>
<p><em>The event?</em></p>
<p>Our prototype will be seen (and used!) by thousands of people at the Urban Prototyping festival on October 20th!! After the festival is over, we will tweak the design based on user feedback and begin promoting the PPlanter as an option for events, construction sites, and businesses that need urinals + greenery.   </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Although we received $1000 in grant funding from Urban Prototyping, we need at least $1500 to bring PPlanter to life.

</p><h1>What We Do
</h1><p></p>
<p>The Fareground Cafe, in downtown Beacon, New York, will be a pay-what-you-can cafe serving delicious, locally-sourced, nutritious meals. People will pay what they can for the food they eat, work in exchange for a meal, and have opportunities to learn and work through
the food service job training built into the community
cafe concept. Fareground 
will offer education and volunteer opportunities and be a gathering 
place where the entire community can share a good meal.
			Additionally, collaborations with other organizations focused on addressing food insecurity will further focus the cafe as a hub of resources for the community. </p><p>Fareground intends to create a bridge between community, poverty, and sustainability in Beacon, which has a poverty level of 15.5% and a wide range of ethnic and economic diversity. The cafe is modeled on One World Everybody Eats, a successful restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah whose non-profit management is serving as consultants on this project and which has been replicated in other cities. Two major features of the cafe are a variable menu and flexible pricing which makes it affordable for all people. The cafe will emphasize organic and unprocessed ingredients from local farms, so the buffet-style menu will change based on availability and provide access to fresh nutritious food. Customers cooperatively participate in determining portion size and a fair price for their meal. The cafe will be operated by those working in exchange for meals as well as by paid employees. Providing workshops on nutrition, gardening, composting, and  cooking in conjunction with sharing space with other organizations focused on food security will reinforce the goals of the cafe. <br/></p><h1>How It Works</h1><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F86530472&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F86530472&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fts%2F464%2F253%2F464253033_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><br/><h1>Who We Are</h1>Fareground was founded by Kara M.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are four soul sisters whose paths have crossed in different times of our lives. We are all connected through a practice called the Art of Hosting meaningful conversations, which has found its way deep into all our work. We kindle the light in places where others see mostly darkness and chaos like rural Zimbabwe and Cairo. We amplify stories of a brave new world emerging. We are working with the gift economy. We create circles of support around women through doularship. We see parenting as a spiritual practice. We are all on the path of liberating our souls to come into their fullest expression in service of life and our planet.</p>

<h3>Why are we organising the Women are Medicine retreat?</h3>
<p>Our friendships have woven into a strong web that can hold a lot. We are inviting women who are ready to step into their fullest expression to weave their own threads into this web, because together we can hold even more. By holding we mean walking through life with strength and grace, bringing fierce loving kindness to whatever we do - my that be in our role as leaders, artists, mothers, sisters, daughters or professionals of any kind. We want to create a space for everyone to bring their gifts and see what emerges from that.</p>
<p>We carry a deep believe that all living beings on this planet are connected. One of the main causes of human suffering is our sense of separation from each other and our planet. At the core of our work is to create spaces where humans can reconnect to a sense of wholeness within ourselves and through authentic connection with each other and nature. We don't have the answers to what is it the worlds needs right now, but we have a sense that it needs us to reconnect. And this is what we are inviting: a space for reconnection. Creating such spaces is an integral part of our work and we have done so in many countries over the last decade (some of us even longer ;)).</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If we reach our funding goal we will be able to cover Sikhithewe's flight and accommodation/food for her and 3 other women. If we raise more, more women will be able to participate.</p>
<p>A flight from Zimbabwe to Turkey costs about 1000€, the cost of accommodation and food for the 5 days we will spend there together is ca. 220€. </p>
<p>For this retreat we are working with the gift economy. The hosting team is not charging a fee but inviting participants to gift towards covering our costs and time.</p>
<p>By contributing to this fund you will enable some wonderful women to strengthen their capacity to host their families and projects with grace and strength through connecting to other women and becoming part of a strong web of relationships that can hold the world in its loving arms.</p>

If we reach our funding goal we will be able to cover Sikhithewe's flight and accommodation/food for her and 3 other women. If we raise more, more women will be able to participate.
A flight from Zimbabwe to Turkey costs about 1000€, the cost of accommodation and food for the 5 days we will spend there together is ca. 220€. 
For this retreat we are working with the gift economy. The hosting team is not charging a fee but inviting participants to gift towards covering our costs and time.
By contributing to this fund you will enable some wonderful women to strengthen their capacity to host their families and projects with grace and strength through connecting to other women and becoming part of a strong web of relationships that can hold the world in its loving arms.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Ashley.  I am soliciting support and sponsorships in order to continue the Pink Boat Regatta in Seattle, WA. Last year, in its first year, as a result of this regatta we wrote a check to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation for $36,000.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This year I'm going rogue by enlisting your support to cover the costs associated with this event in order to donate <strong>100% of proceeds</strong> to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is a recent article describing how we're trying to save the regatta and why I need YOU to help:</div>

<h3>Event Highlights &amp; Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Date: August 17th, 2013 in the waters of Shilshole Bay in Seattle, WA. Sailboat race will take place from noon-3pm.</li>
<li>Party to follow at <span>7755 Seaview Ave Nw, Seattle</span> (Corinthian Yacht Club)</li>
<li>FREE beer courtesy of Emerald City Brewing Company</li>
<li>Mystery Bay Seafood &amp; Catering will be on site</li>
<li>We already have some AMAZING auction items!</li>
</ul><div>This race is unique because fundraising dollars translate to buoys on the race course - so participating boats can actually increase their chances of winning just by soliciting donations to the cause.  Furthermore, ANYONE can raise money and decide right up until 5pm on race day how they would like their dollars turned into buoys!  Throw the race!  Cheat to win!  The race is scored twice - including, and not including, ""purchased buoys"" - which means it remains competetive for those serious racers out there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is also a pinkest boat award.  This translates to ridiculous amounts of awesomeness.</div>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>There are a lot of expenses involved in putting on a regatta.  The hosting yacht club is run by volunteers, which means there are a bunch of awesome people working hard to make this happen without getting a cent.  I do, however, still need to pay for the following:</p>

<li>Venue rental for the Charity Auction &amp; after party</li>
<li>Moorage for participating boats</li>
<li>Up-front costs associated with tshirts and other merchandise</li>
<li>Trophies and other awards</li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We're Ryan and Kip, and we've been working for next to nothing recording local musicians and helping to promote them for four years now.  We are now ready to expand to be able to help more musicians get their music out into the world without the hassle of all the contracts and legalities found when you have to go through a record label.</p>
<p>We are trying to raise $125,000 to move to a new facility and build a live room, drum booth, and vocal booth, and equip the facility with some new gear, expanding our capabilities.</p>
<p>By helping us realize this dream, you'll be helping hundreds of musicians to achieve their dreams, who may otherwise never have the chance.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So where is this $125,000 going?</p>
<p>$3,200 will get us in the door of a new facility. Then we need permits.</p>
<p>$1,000 worth of permits.  Then we can buy materials.</p>
<p>$12,000 worth of materials.  Soundproofing isn't cheap.  Neither is the team that builds it.</p>
<p>$17,000 goes to construction costs. Painted walls and all.  Now we need computers! 3 of 'em, and some pretty expensive software.</p>
<p>$10,000 covers it.  With software it could be worse.  And the golden egg?</p>
<p>$69,000 to expand and upgrade our equipment. Wow. </p>
<p>We left just enough extra ($12,800) in what we're asking for to cover the fees on indiegogo should we get just a dollar less than exactly what we need.</p>
<p>But don't worry, any extra money just goes to improve the studio further.  Every dollar makes a big difference.</p>
<p>We came up with some great perks to say thanks for all the help in helping others pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>If we can't reach the entire goal, we'll use what we get to do as much of this as possible, and keep trying to raise more money so we can help independent musicians share their music with the world.</p>

<p><strong>HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A VICTIM OR KNOW SOMEONE THAT HAS BEEN OF A VICTIM  ABUSE???  THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM GOING THROUGH.</strong></p>
<p>After purchasing my house, giving birth to my son, preparing for my upcoming wedding my finances are gone to pay my lawyer to keep my abusive ex from MY daughter. I thought I had paid her in full, but with more paper work and a postponement the bill has gone up again. I go back to court the April 29th, now remember this has been going on for over a year, postponement after another, costing ME lots of money and I still owe my attorney. He has had 3 different attorneys and never paid one of them in full.  His last one terminated their relationship due to non payment, so now he will get a new attorney, and there will probably be yet another continuance.  My attorney suggested I bring in a guardian  to help with this, and my ex was to pay half, which may I add he hasn't, so I had to pay the full bill for her. He doesn't pay his child support, when he adds anything to her account it's a small amount like 38.00. Since leaving him I found out he was NOT the person he pretended to be. I have now found out he has at LEAST 7 children that he doesn't take care of, most he has never seen nor acknowledges.  But yet he wants mine.  He has not laid eyes on her for over 4 years, and she is just 5 now.. I have an order of protection against him for domestic abuse, but again, he thinks he can come back into my life and get his abusive hands on MY daughter???? He doesn't care about her, this is all about me.  Pay back. He told me after he threatened to kill me that I would never get rid of him he would always be in my life. I pray the courts see the truth, but you never know.  I really need to pay off my attorney and this guardian so she can start her investigation Please help me help keep my daughter safe..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Jessica</p>
<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>This is the 2nd time I had to ask for help due to what he is putting me through. I have spent 10s of thousands of dollars in the last 5 years due to him. One of his reasons is to break me, but he still will never touch my child.  Thank you all for all of your help. xoxoxoxoxox</p>

We are seeking your help in executing this three-phase project. The first phase will take place in March 2013 and will cost $ 20,000.</p>
<p>Christine Berthet and Martin Treat are the cofounders of CHEKPEDS. Since 2005 we have advocated to calm the traffic in Hell's Kitchen through various initiatives including installing bike lanes and trees in the area and reclaiming excessive highway space, which helps reduce crashes. </p>
<p>Kathleen Treat is the Chair of the Hell’s Kitchen Neighborhood Association, which since 1995 has advocated for affordable housing, improved quality of life and improved health. We experience the third highest asthma hospitalization rate In Manhattan.</p>
<p>Shanti Nagel, is the director of Cultivation for CHDC. Since 1973 CHDC has developed hundreds of affordable residences in the neighborhood with an eye toward conservation, restoration and beautification. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Peyser represents over 200 residents adjacent to the park.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking $15,000 in funding to remove a traffic light island in order to free up a contiguous three-lane area to build the park on the east. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has expressed its willingness to free up the unused lanes of traffic, but the traffic island must be removed first and we have to pay for it. </p>
<p>Later in the year there will be two hearings to collect input from the community at large and finalize the park design and we anticipate the City will fund the construction of the whole park. </p>
<p><strong>Give one , we get two !</strong> All contributions up to $ 7,500 are being matched by a generous donor ! <strong>Give one we get three!</strong> If your employer matches  donations, get the matching for our park. <strong> Your and your company's contributions are tax deductible</strong>: we are registered as a charity with 501(c)(3) status. </p>
<p>You will be invited to the Benefit Party in early January. in addition your contribution will be recognized once the park is installed by listing your name prominently on the web, and with plaques at the entrance, on furniture, benches and tables.</p>
<p>IF we do not reach our goal, we will return the funds to you (net of fees).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our community ranks in the city’s bottom 2% in terms of green space per residents.  This is a terrific opportunity to remedy this problem in Hell’s Kitchen South, home to a large population of low-income tenants, a school without a schoolyard and a growing residential population with no green space or parks easily accessible. We hope you will be able to help us overcome this first hurdle and give life to the project.</p>
<p>Transportation Infrastructure occupies  50% of the land, thus roadway is the only land available to convert to park. Reducing the roadway is also a very effective way to reduce speed and crashes. </p>
<p>Our organizations have successfully raised funds to create the 9th Avenue Renaissance, to fund a 4 -year Engineering study of the traffic in Hell's kitchen which led to the installation of bike lanes on 8th and 9th Avenues in our neighborhood. </p>
<p>We need your help to overcome this first obstacle and win park space for this park-starved community.</p>

<p>HELLO EVERYONE,</p>
<p>MY NAME IS JEFF LARSEN, AND I AM AN INVENTOR! I WORK HARD AND I WORK A LOT. I DON’T LIE, CHEAT, OR STEAL. I STARTED WORKING IN THE LANDSCAPE INDUSTRY AS A SEASONAL LABOR EMPLOYEE AND CLIMBED THE RANKS OF SOME OF LARGEST LANDSCAPE COMPANIES IN THE NATION. I DO HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THE LANDSCAPE AND IRRIGATION INDUSTRY. </p>
<p> OVER THE LAST 10 MONTHS, I HAVE DEVELOPED A LAWN AND GARDEN EDGING SYSTEM WITH ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES. I HAVE NAMED IT KNUCKLEHEAD EDGING BECAUSE OF ONE OF ITS DESIGN FEATURES--NOT TO MENTION THAT IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT ANY KNUCKLEHEAD CAN INSTALL IT (AND IT WAS DEFINITELY CREATED BY A KNUCKLEHEAD;) .</p>
<h3>Knucklehead Edging</h3>
<p>KNUCKLEHEAD TM EDGING IS MY SOLUTION TO MULTIPLE ISSUES THAT CURRENT LANDSCAPE EDGING AND CURBING PRODUCTS DO NOT ADDRESS, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES.  CONCRETE CURBING, STEEL AND ALUMINUM EDGING, AND VARIOUS STYLES OF PLASTIC BENDABLE EDGING PROVIDE ONLY A DEFINING LINE BETWEEN DIFFERENT LANDSCAPED SURFACES.  TURF GRASS, BECAUSE IT HAS DEEP ROOTS, WILL GROW UNDERNEATH ANY OF THE CURRENT PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TODAY.  THE ONLY WAY TO SECURE A WEED BARRIER TO THE GROUND IS WITH FABRIC PINS. THIS PROCEDURE IS INEFFECTIVE AND ALLOWS GRASS TO INVADE UNWANTED AREAS.</p>
<p>MADE FROM 80-100% RECYCLED PLASTIC AND 100% RECYCLABLE. KNUCKLEHEAD EDGING FEATURES A DOUBLE WIDE STEPPED DESIGN (AN INCH AND A HALF WIDE), A TONGUE AND GROOVE WEED FABRIC RETAINING SYSTEM, AND HOUSING TO PROTECT YOUR LOW VOLTAGE LANDSCAPE LIGHTING WIRE AND DRIP IRRIGATION TUBING.</p>

<h3>CHALLENGES I'VE ENCOUNTERED</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Knucklehead Edging as a product line is astronomical in size and the same to the landscape industry. Since Knucklehead Edging benefits the aspects of lighting, drip irrigation, weed barrier material, and overall appearance, it will set the standard in the industry for years to come! Surprisingly, I have had very few problems with Knucklehead Edging until just recently.</p>
<p>Prior to August 2012 I thought I was going to be able to build this product one foot at a time! When I had a order to fill, I would: Place a ""will call"" order with my supplier, pick up the order, and mill the material into our finished product. Edgeworks USA was scheduled to have a grand opening and wanted to have inventory on hand for this event. Like usual, I placed my order and upon loading noticed that it was thinner than the prior product purchased. After contacting a sales representative we discovered that this was the new product available. The current manufacturer of my polyethylene stock has changed the dimensions of their product, thus resulting in a product that will not be sufficient for the features of Knucklehead Edging.  I have been informed that any materials specific to Knucklehead Edging from this point forward, will need to be a custom order and will need to be purchased in semi load quantities for the best pricing. </p>
<p>Knucklehead Edging as pre-formed shapes are collapsable so most pieces are no more than 6-8 feet long. This size fits perfectly into most automobiles, but not so well in boxes for shipping. Edgeworks USA is currently shipping products from Utah anywhere in the United States. Like any other products, shipping is a significant cost associated with Knucklehead Edging products. We try to package orders in the most efficient way possible but depending on the order, this may not always be possible.  Edgeworks USA is looking into setting up multiple location (possibly franchises) throughout the United States specifically to lower cost associated with shipping. Ideally, Edgeworks USA locations will supply local distributors with products for residential use and wholesale purchases in their region.</p>
<p>The whole Knucklehead Edging process starts as blank stock at 1.25 pounds per foot. Once the blank stock is milled into Knucklehead Edging the total linear foot weight drops by 33%. This is beneficial because it directly relates to shipping cost. This process alone increases shipping volume by 33%, and produces 33% of shavings that are 100% recyclable. Edgeworks USA Chicago will be the next facility established. All Knucklehead Edging will be produced at this location and shipped to Edgeworks USA and either sold as un-assembled or assembled pre-formed shapes.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process of Knucklehead Edging from blank stock to finished product, is complete in ONE step. This ONE step produces Knucklehead Edging ready to be installed in the field or pre-formed as a second process in house. Step #1 consists of a single pass through a nine tooled saw assembly at a rate of 1000 linear feet per hour. Step #2, (in-house pre-forming) is where Knucklehead Edging becomes specific shapes and has weed barrier options installed. This step is completed in-house and has production rates in the 20-30 linear feet per hour.</p>
<p>My first semi load of blank stock will be a huge risk because it is more material than I currently have orders for. It will be a challenge funding the initial large purchases necessary for best pricing. It will be a challenge getting people aware of the ""Awesomeness"" of Knucklehead Edging. I love a good challenge!</p>
<p>The feed back and response from the public has been great! KnuckleHead Edging debuted at the salt lake city spring home and garden show in March of 2012. This was a new experience for myself, but after 3 and a half days and over 750 potential customers and 2 without positive feedback, I feel it was a great success.</p>
<h3>JEFF LARSEN BIO</h3>
</div>
<p>Edgeworks USA, llc is the result of a lifetime of providing landscaping and irrigation services throughout the Wasatch Front. Beginning as a young child, Jeff Larsen developed a strong work ethic working in a relative's greenhouse and farming business. As young adult, Jeff felt a desire to build a career in the landscape industry. By earning multiple certifications in irrigation, he climbed the ranks of some of the largest landscape and irrigation companies.</p>
<p>Mid-summer 2007, an opportunity arrived to pursue the dream of being his own boss and small business owner. Keep it Green Sprinkling by Jeff Larsen Inc. was founded. Working and contracting with homeowners, Jeff realized that his clients all had similar needs and dislikes with current landscape edging available. Four years later, onsite with extra material on hand, two pieces of polyboard edging screwed together gave Jeff the idea that has turned into KNUCKLEHEAD TM EDGING. Realizing the potential of the product, Jeff spent a couple hours with a router in his garage to build the first tongue and groove version with weed fabric prototype for patenting. Early 2012, post filing for patent pending, Jeff built a custom profile milling station specific for Knucklehead Edging. After months of trial and error, experimenting and numerous new developments, Knucklehead TM Edging is what we see today! Featuring our patented double-wide stepped look, tongue and groove weed fabric retaining system, low voltage landscape lighting wire and drip irrigation tubing housing!</p>

It will be a challenge funding the initial large purchases necessary for best pricing. It will be a challenge getting people aware of the ""Awesomeness"" of Knucklehead Edging. I love a good challenge!
The feed back and response from the public has been great! KnuckleHead Edging debuted at the salt lake city spring home and garden show in March of 2012. This was a new experience for myself, but after 3 and a half days and over 750 potential customers and 2 without positive feedback, I feel it was a great success.
JEFF LARSEN BIO

Edgeworks USA, llc is the result of a lifetime of providing landscaping and irrigation services throughout the Wasatch Front. Beginning as a young child, Jeff Larsen developed a strong work ethic working in a relative's greenhouse and farming business. As young adult, Jeff felt a desire to build a career in the landscape industry. By earning multiple certifications in irrigation, he climbed the ranks of some of the largest landscape and irrigation companies.
Mid-summer 2007, an opportunity arrived to pursue the dream of being his own boss and small business owner. Keep it Green Sprinkling by Jeff Larsen Inc. was founded. Working and contracting with homeowners, Jeff realized that his clients all had similar needs and dislikes with current landscape edging available. Four years later, onsite with extra material on hand, two pieces of polyboard edging screwed together gave Jeff the idea that has turned into KNUCKLEHEAD TM EDGING. Realizing the potential of the product, Jeff spent a couple hours with a router in his garage to build the first tongue and groove version with weed fabric prototype for patenting. Early 2012, post filing for patent pending, Jeff built a custom profile milling station specific for Knucklehead Edging. After months of trial and error, experimenting and numerous new developments, Knucklehead TM Edging is what we see today! Featuring our patented double-wide stepped look, tongue and groove weed fabric retaining system, low voltage landscape lighting wire and drip irrigation tubing housing!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3><span style="""">The first night I dated my wife, I promised her that she’d never crave another cup of decaf coffee after drinking a cup of my tea.  I’m not a arrogant man so I wasn't being cocky, but after years of serving my signature blends to very satisfied friends, family and coworkers, I am just that sure that anyone, (hopefully everyone!) will love my tea as much as I love blending them.

<h3>Hello everyone!</h3>
<p>My name is Stephanie Cleary and I've been suffering from Alopecia Areata since I was 3 years old.  I've had a rough time with it most of my life but I am finally becoming comfortable with it.  I started modeling at age 14 and have never looked back!  I am hoping that funds raised from this campaign will help to produce an event to generate more awareness and even more money to the Alopecia Cause.</p>
<p>With your help you can make a fun event that will help a lot of kids deal with a disease that very few people have heard of.</p>
<p>Alopecia areata is a auto-immune disease that causes a sudden loss of patches of hair on the scalp and sometimes other parts of the body. It is nonscarring, which means that there is no permanent damage to the hair follicle. In most people, new hair eventually grows back in the affected areas, although this process can take months. Approximately 50 percent of people with mild alopecia areata recover within a year; however, most people will experience more than one episode during their lifetime.</p>
<p>The estimated prevalence of alopecia areata is approximately 1 in 1000 people, with a lifetime risk of approximately 2 percent. About one person in 50 will suffer from alopecia areata at some point in their life (or 6 Million people in the US at the current census). For most patients the onset is before age 30; it occurs in men and women of all races equally. The condition can develop at any age, although most people develop alopecia areata for the first time during childhood.</p>
<p>Alopecia areata is not life threatening, and does not cause physical pain. However, the cosmetic effects of hair loss can be devastating.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The funding will be going towards the event production and whatever is left after the completion of the event will be donated to the cause.</p>
<p>With this unique disease we can offer a unique gift with your donation of $10 or more, you will get a complimentary bracelet that is being sold in a local craft store, and swag bag with goodies from the event.  If you donate $20 or more you will get the bracelet, and swag bag!  And lastly if you donate $35 or more you will get all the stuff above and 2 free tickets to the event!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This cause helps bring a disease that may not be directly life threatening it can however be in-directly life threatening.  These kids need hope to know that one day there will be a cure for this disease.</p>
<p>Losing one’s hair can be a devastating experience, particularly because it develops suddenly and the loss is difficult to hide. Women and children frequently struggle with depression or low self-esteem as a result of their hair loss.</p>

It has been vacant since the 1990’s and is in immediate need of roof repairs. Water is cascading through the east wall through a leak in the roof and is causing substantial damage to this precious resource. Historic Albany must repair the roof so that the building will continue to stand while a plan to restore the building is developed.<br/></span></p>

Historic Albany Foundation needs to raise $10,000 for immediate repairs to the roof of the Van Ostrande-Radliff House at 48 Hudson Avenue.  Historic Albany recently acquired the Van Ostrande-Radliff House at 48 Hudson Avenue in Albany, New York.  Built in 1728, it is documented to be the oldest surviving building in the city. It has been vacant since the 1990’s and is in immediate need of roof repairs. Water is cascading through the east wall through a leak in the roof and is causing substantial damage to this precious resource. Historic Albany must repair the roof so that the building will continue to stand while a plan to restore the building is developed.
Historic Albany Foundation is a private, not-for-profit membership organization established in 1974. The Foundation was formed by a small group of concerned neighbors and citizens after New York State Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller began one of the largest urban renewal projects: the South Mall/Empire State Plaza, that wiped out over 1,500 buildings and displaced hundreds of families.
HAF fulfills its mandate through public education, promotion and membership, provision of design and technical assistance, community projects, advocacy for endangered buildings, publications, tours, lectures and operation of an architectural parts warehouse. 
Our mission is to preserve and protect buildings that have architectural, historic or civic value, by providing technical assistance, education, and advocacy.


How You're Helping & the ""Perks"" You'll Receive:

With each level of giving, our supporters (you!) will receive a different perk!  Each level of higher giving, adds another perk onto what you will already be receiving.
All of the funds raised from this campaign will go towards the repairs of the roof for the Van Ostrande-Radliff House.  Sadly, if we don't reach our goal, we will still put all of your generous donations towards this project.

<h2><strong>My Story:</strong></h2>
<p><em>Hi, my name is Chef Vicki Mancuso and my earliest memory of cooking was standing on a chair in front of the stove with my mother Josie when I was 7 years old and learning how to make what the Italians call ""Sunday Gravy"". (otherwise known to non italian individuals as Marinara  sauce). This and other times like it instilled in me a love of food that bore a passion to become a chef.</em></p>
<p><em>Since age 19 I have been in the culinary industry for upwards of 20 years, holding every position from deli sandwich maker to corporate food service manager with food service companies such as Flik International and Host America Corp.</em></p>
<p><em>With age brings wisdom and a true self-awareness - after being touched so deeply by my parents' brave battle with cancer and them passing within 4 months of each other, I  have a heightened appreciation of life itself so I decided to follow my dreams of owning my own business.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope to bring some of the joy to others that I was lucky enough to get in my mom's kitchen - good food made from scratch and served from the heart with love and laughter.</em></p>
<p><em>The success of Mancuso's Mobile Italian Kitchen will allow me, via my contributors and customers, to donate some of the proceeds to the American Cancer Society to do a small part in ensuring the great work of that organization continues.</em></p>
<h2>What I Need:</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>A  used Food Truck will cost between $15,000.00 to $25,000.00. In addition to the food truck I will need the following listed below...</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Permits - $500</em></li>
<li><em>Licsences - $500 </em></li>
<li><em>Equipment - $1000.00</em></li>
