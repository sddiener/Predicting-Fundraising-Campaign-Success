My name is Kevin Harris and I have always been attracted to
anything artistic. My artistic endeavors began at age 7 when I was first
introduced to comic books. The imagery and creativity of these artists just amazed my young mind. 
I began copying what I saw and
before long my teachers, realizing my
talents, began encouraging me. For the last
15 years I have supplemented my income as a mid-management professional by painting portraits with very
good results.
My work has been featured in Art&beyond magazine on
multiple occasions and is published in a book titled Living Artists Today.
This campaign is about a couple of things
· 
Opening a gallery / studio has been a dream of
mine for some time. Currently, my dining room doubles as
my art studio and a studio
will allow me to really do what I love,
which is to promote the arts. Our
schools need more of an art presence. Young adults need to know that there is a
future in creating beautiful things.
· 
I want to create a space where children and adults can learn about art and the creative process.

As an artist these things are very important to me because I
find that there is a void in the public school system as it relates to art
education and career planning. Art has
been a staple in my life since I was a small child so I want to encourage children
and adults to pursue their art dreams,
no matter how big or small those dreams may be. 
What We Need & What You Get
My goals are lofty and here is where the funds will go
To help me start the studio where I have the space and resources to host workshops
for children as well as adults, I am asking
for $30,000. 
This includes all art materials, a printer capable of reproducing fine
art prints, easels and chairs, to name a few things.
The perks are a labor of love as all the art I have created
over the past year specifically have enormous meaning to me. My growth as an
artist has been within that time frame and it has produced some of my most meaningful work
If I do not meet the entire goal, the studio will open,
and I still plan on hosting these workshops, so the funds
will be used for canvasses, paint, brushes and other art supplies
to get us started.
The Impact
As an artist I have had the pleasure of interacting with
some wonderful people who have encouraged me to proceed. I want to be that
voice that encourages young artists everywhere and opening the studio/gallery
is the springboard to that. My artist supporting artists series has set a

<p>After you purchase your painting ""perk"", and our 30-day campaign comes to an end, you'll get an email from us requesting your photo (and painting size for those who ordered ""Anything Goes"" or ""Cultured Baller"" rewards). Simply attach your instagram or digital photo to your reply and we'll have everything we need! <strong>Note: you can only use photos that you own or have the express permission of the owner to use.</strong> </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that your photo should either be square (all instagrams are) or rectangular with dimensions of 4 by 3 (the normal dimensions for most photos).

<p>There are limits to any painter's dexterity that make it extremely difficult to paint 10 people or a fruit stand on a small (12X12 inch) canvas.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The MARZ Project (Media &amp; Arts Resource Zone) is a free, nonprofit drop-in digital media studio where young artists learn valuable tools for creative expression in audio, video, and graphic art.  Under the direction of our professional instructors, students can work on their own projects, or participate in job training.  Local businesses receive low cost marketing materials, while MARZ media makers develop job skills.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Our Indiegogo project is to build a better production suite for our students and bump up our media production services.  We want the skills students learn and the jobs they're able to take on to be competitive of the media landscape of today, but in order for our students to produce professional projects, they need access to professionals tools.  This is why we need your help!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>The MARZ Project Mission</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Operating since 1997, our mission is to ""provide a safe space for young people engaging in healthy self-expression, confidence-building, leadership skills, and a creative and just community.""  Throughout our 15 years of operation, we've managed to make sure that all MARZ Project resources and workshops are free to Humboldt County youth.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>What we Do</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Every Tuesday through Friday after school, students representing a cross section of local youth from very diverse backgrounds come to MARZ to hang out, make friends, work on creative projects at their own pace, and to make lasting and positive contributions to their communities.  They have access to a small music recording studio with a variety of instruments, a computer lab with equipment and editing software for video and digital graphics projects, as well as an ""analog art room"" to reinforce studio art fundamentals like drawing and painting.  </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Students who want to take their skills to the next level can join the Media Crew where they're trained by our core staff instructors and partnered on paying projects for agencies and nonprofit organizations in the community.  They earn money while learning to produce media projects that meet professional standards.  Project skills include:  video and radio PSA's, event posters/flyers, logo designs, event coverage and documentary-style pieces.  Some crew members also DJ and perform their music at fundraisers and art openings, and put on all ages drug/alcohol free dance parties for other local youth.  Our goal is to send them out into the world with skills that they can use to do work they enjoy, meaningful work that contributes to their community.  Here is a partial list of projects MARZ student artists have worked on to earn money and serve the community: </p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>MARZ All-Stars!</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Raven came in to the MARZ Project five years ago, to challenge her fear of performing in front of others, and now works as a digital media assistant for the project.  Raven produces public service announcements, organizes alcohol and drug free music concerts, creates and distributes flyers, shoots and edits video projects, helps students in the computer and music recording lab, and yes, writes and performs original music regularly now.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">""I can't imagine where, or even who, I'd be without the MARZ Project,"" Raven says.  ""I've learned a lot of skills that help me feel really confident about what it is I have to offer the world.  I also volunteer for the North Star Quest Camp as a mentor for seventh and eighth grade girls.  I believe I can make a positive change in my community."" </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Felicia came to MARZ to learn video skills.  She joined our media crew two weeks later.  She's now working on a documentary style piece about being a Hmong dancer and exploring the importance of preserving her cultural traditions.  Her story is thoughtful, well researched, visually rich, and we know it will raise awareness of the Hmong culture in our community.  </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Taylor came to MARZ when she was 15.  She's been on her own since she was 16.  When she wasn't doing homework, she was usually hanging out at MARZ.  Now she's the lead videographer on our media crew, studying film at Humboldt State University...and still getting straight A's!  She recently got an entry level position at a local TV station.  We like to think that the caring, support, and sense of family here at MARZ had a little to do with that.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><b>How YOU Can Help!</b></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Like most small grassroots projects, we have the skills and the heart, and struggle with limited and always changing funding.  Our equipment is outdated.  We spend a lot of time doing work-arounds on our ten year old video editing computers, and not enough time editing.  We're able to get some software updated, but some is hopelessly out of date.  Our recording studio, although a great resource for drop in musicians who wouldn't otherwise have access to music technology, is built on worn out hardware and isn't ready to support professional level projects.  We also need to replace our old PA system, one of our primary ways our music students interact with the community and help raise funds for the project.  We often have to borrow gear from community/staff members to get jobs done!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Having access to up to date equipment will dramatically increase the quality of our productions, and provide more opportunities for our students to take on real world projects.  These projects will also provide the MARZ Project with ongoing revenues, thereby boosting our attempts at making MARZ truly sustainable.  See our complete tech plan for a breakdown on what we need.  </p>

The MARZ Project (Media & Arts Resource Zone) is a free, nonprofit drop-in digital media studio where young artists learn valuable tools for creative expression in audio, video, and graphic art.  Under the direction of our professional instructors, students can work on their own projects, or participate in job training.  Local businesses receive low cost marketing materials, while MARZ media makers develop job skills.
What We Need
Our Indiegogo project is to build a better production suite for our students and bump up our media production services.  We want the skills students learn and the jobs they're able to take on to be competitive of the media landscape of today, but in order for our students to produce professional projects, they need access to professionals tools.  This is why we need your help!
The MARZ Project Mission
Operating since 1997, our mission is to ""provide a safe space for young people engaging in healthy self-expression, confidence-building, leadership skills, and a creative and just community.""  Throughout our 15 years of operation, we've managed to make sure that all MARZ Project resources and workshops are free to Humboldt County youth.
What we Do
Every Tuesday through Friday after school, students representing a cross section of local youth from very diverse backgrounds come to MARZ to hang out, make friends, work on creative projects at their own pace, and to make lasting and positive contributions to their communities.  They have access to a small music recording studio with a variety of instruments, a computer lab with equipment and editing software for video and digital graphics projects, as well as an ""analog art room"" to reinforce studio art fundamentals like drawing and painting.  
Students who want to take their skills to the next level can join the Media Crew where they're trained by our core staff instructors and partnered on paying projects for agencies and nonprofit organizations in the community.  They earn money while learning to produce media projects that meet professional standards.  Project skills include:  video and radio PSA's, event posters/flyers, logo designs, event coverage and documentary-style pieces.  Some crew members also DJ and perform their music at fundraisers and art openings, and put on all ages drug/alcohol free dance parties for other local youth.  Our goal is to send them out into the world with skills that they can use to do work they enjoy, meaningful work that contributes to their community.  Here is a partial list of projects MARZ student artists have worked on to earn money and serve the community: 



Northern California Indian Development Council: Elders Dinner event coverage
Humboldt County Mental Health Department: 1st place winner in poster contest
YouthAbility youth job-training development support:  3 video projects
Humboldt County Department of Heath and Human Services: Graphics layout project 
Raven Project: mini documentary about safe spaces for LGBT youth 
Spare Change: 3 yrs performance coverage/documentary video
Humboldt County Office of Education/TAPESTRY: HIV/STD prevention PSA series (TV, radio, print) 
Humboldt Economic Development Department:  Youth job-training program/3-part documentary
Boys and Girls Club: Video interviews for 40 year anniversary celebration
Teen Court: poster design
ASAP Substance Abuse Prevention Program: logo and graphic design

<p>Curators’ Word</p>
<p>Each of us finds our ethical position slowly through a
combination of family values, community norms and cultural signifiers. These
influences bring together sets of potential positions for us to sift through
and begin the process of decision making that leads us to adulthood. The
sources for much of these influences can be varied and of varying quality but
we seem to make out OK in the end, or at least most of us do.</p>
<p>When we began the process of building this exhibition we
began with the notion of the difficulty in translating one language to the
other. There is an immediate problem in communication that seemed valuable for
us to focus on. Not just spoken and written language either, but also how the
Western visual art tradition has developed and the complexities of cultural
transmission from one set of cultures to another set. What do we share and what
is alien between us?</p>
<p>With television and film being such influential
purveyors of myriad ideas and approaches many ways of seeing and thinking about
the world can be gleamed from them. Many of our conceptions of the world start
here. These were often from various points around the globe which perhaps can
provide a wider education on the ideas of right and wrong. One of these
programs was a 1973 Japanese version of a classic Chinese story called Water
Margin, written originally by Shi Nai’an. When formulating this exhibition and finding
linkages to situate the show’s themes my co-curators, Sijia Chen and Kio
Griffith, and I, discovered that we had all watched the same program as
children while growing up in the UK, China and Japan/USA respectively. Half way
across the world and we shared a common root in growing up. Even the quote
which began each episode became pregnant with meaning for us as children, even
if we could not quite decipher it - </p>
<p>“Do not despise the snake for having no horns, for who
is to say he will not become a Dragon?”</p>
<p>Each week the heroes of the tale would struggle for
right over wrong. Set during the Song Dynasty the outlaws fight injustice and
eventually are granted amnesty and then sent to resist foreign invaders and
rebel forces, ironically. That the outlaws of Water Margin ultimately failed
should not distract us from the central message that the struggle is worthy and
that we are made up of the decisions we make regardless of whether it is the
easy one or guaranteed success. It is an existential approach that values the
struggle over the result. Just like the actual act of making art, the theme of
the story strikes a chord with artists everywhere......This is the basis for
our exhibition - the languages of contemporary art that we investigate in the
service of both the exploration of visual languages and the role they play in
the social field. We hope to direct the Chinese audience’s attention to the
importance, for the artists, of making art that is talking about the history of
aesthetic development in Western art alongside urgent matters to address
socially in the US.</p>
<p>And so the artists for this show were selected. They
address themes which respond to issues concerned with this transmission - of
ideals and of ethics, while acknowledging that being Human, in itself, supplies
some of the elements needed to cross some barriers. They self-reflexively
address the inherent problematic issues that arise in the act of translation.
There is present in these works a hope for the future, in attempting to
communicate across those barriers between us, that place value in the attempt
itself and hope that with perserverence the hurdle will eventually be overcome.
Using a Los Angeles art vernacular, as the Water Margin was in Chinese
vernacular, the art works reveal complex layerings of thought that encompasses
both philosophic and aesthetic concerns with an optimism for Humanity that
calls out to unite us all.</p><p></p></div>","An American Water Margin

Curators’ Word
Each of us finds our ethical position slowly through a
combination of family values, community norms and cultural signifiers. These
influences bring together sets of potential positions for us to sift through
and begin the process of decision making that leads us to adulthood. The
sources for much of these influences can be varied and of varying quality but
we seem to make out OK in the end, or at least most of us do.
When we began the process of building this exhibition we
began with the notion of the difficulty in translating one language to the
other. There is an immediate problem in communication that seemed valuable for
us to focus on. Not just spoken and written language either, but also how the
Western visual art tradition has developed and the complexities of cultural
transmission from one set of cultures to another set. What do we share and what
is alien between us?
With television and film being such influential
purveyors of myriad ideas and approaches many ways of seeing and thinking about
the world can be gleamed from them. Many of our conceptions of the world start
here. These were often from various points around the globe which perhaps can
provide a wider education on the ideas of right and wrong. One of these
programs was a 1973 Japanese version of a classic Chinese story called Water

“Do not despise the snake for having no horns, for who

Each week the heroes of the tale would struggle for

I will continue to build on this portfolio after, with all of the knowledge I gain from this program, in my last year of high school in Advanced Placement (AP) Art class. I hope that with the knowledge I gain at this program I will make art that catches peoples attention, and they will listen. This financial help will be the catalyst in my journey as an independent artist.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are trying to start a small-scale pottery production and contribute to the Maine art scene, but the creative market is notably difficult. As young artists, we are looking to gain experience and better our understanding of the market. This project is about expanding our portfolios and skills while doing what we love. It is also about creating an image, a business, and most importantly, making a meaningful contribution to the greater art community.</p><p>We plan to create a variety of affordable pottery meant to be used everyday. There is no guidebook for young artists. We want to be transparent about this experience to share our successes (and failures) with other young artists by maintaining a blog throughout the process detailing and documenting our costs, strategies, and processes. </p><p>We are not heading into the project blindly. We both have experience in the arts, and particularly in ceramics. </p><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><h3>What We Need.</h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal;"">In order to be able to maintain a selling model which is affordable, we need to reduce the start-up studio costs. We are borrowing and building much of the other equipment and materials needed for this project. <br/></span></h3><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""><br/></font></p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">Our major start -up expenses are as follow:</font></p><h3>

By having the opportunity to work in this way, not only will we learn more about what it takes to be working artists, but we will be able to advance our skills by having the ability to work longer and create more. </span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact.</h3><p>Our project is intended to be about more than just funding equipment and selling our work. It does not end here. We will continually update a blog so that you can see what we're up to, and so that other aspiring artists can benefit from our project.</p><p>Please give as much or as you can. All funds will go directly to the purchase of studio equipment and supplies. We are creating sellable work, but by reducing our start-up costs, we will be able to make work that is affordable and accessible to all. Our work will be available in the greater Portland, ME area and online.</p><p>We want to make art, but more importantly, we want to learn while we do it. We are willing and eager to put ourselves out there, but we need your support. </p><p>Finally, we ask that you support us by offering any suggestions, connections, ideas, impassioned warnings, questions, or advice that you may have.

<p></p></div>","The Idea.This project is about answering questions. We are trying to start a small-scale pottery production and contribute to the Maine art scene, but the creative market is notably difficult. As young artists, we are looking to gain experience and better our understanding of the market. This project is about expanding our portfolios and skills while doing what we love. It is also about creating an image, a business, and most importantly, making a meaningful contribution to the greater art community.We plan to create a variety of affordable pottery meant to be used everyday. There is no guidebook for young artists. We want to be transparent about this experience to share our successes (and failures) with other young artists by maintaining a blog throughout the process detailing and documenting our costs, strategies, and processes. We are not heading into the project blindly. We both have experience in the arts, and particularly in ceramics. What We Need.In order to be able to maintain a selling model which is affordable, we need to reduce the start-up studio costs. We are borrowing and building much of the other equipment and materials needed for this project. Our major start -up expenses are as follow:
Kiln: $1000
Kiln instillation: $600Raw materials: $200Clay: 49 cents/lb. Our own studio ensures complete control over the firing process, allowing us to produce the work that we want to create. To use an existing community studio, we would be paying hourly-use fees upward of $15 each, in addition to firing fees. By having the opportunity to work in this way, not only will we learn more about what it takes to be working artists, but we will be able to advance our skills by having the ability to work longer and create more. The Impact.Our project is intended to be about more than just funding equipment and selling our work. It does not end here. We will continually update a blog so that you can see what we're up to, and so that other aspiring artists can benefit from our project.Please give as much or as you can. All funds will go directly to the purchase of studio equipment and supplies. We are creating sellable work, but by reducing our start-up costs, we will be able to make work that is affordable and accessible to all. Our work will be available in the greater Portland, ME area and online.We want to make art, but more importantly, we want to learn while we do it. We are willing and eager to put ourselves out there, but we need your support. Finally, we ask that you support us by offering any suggestions, connections, ideas, impassioned warnings, questions, or advice that you may have. Thank you– we really and truly appreciate it. - m + ePlease follow our art-making adventure at: http://mepotteryproject.blogspot.com/ And on Facebook at:https://www.facebook.com/mepotteryproject More About Us:Maxwell HoldenMax with part of his Junior Review Exhibition, a collection of tea bowls. I am a senior at Hartwick College in NY, where I study Ceramics and Religion.

has been created by an international ensemble of postgraduate MA students each
pursuing their individual specialisms and studio practice. The works presented
ingeniously use a variety of digital technologies to explore a diverse range of
creative themes and ideas. Prepare to be taken on a thought provoking,
cultural, playful and cosmic journey through the minds of seven digital media
artists, establishing themselves at the cutting edge of technology and artistic
practice.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>Lee-Ann
Sandford is a graphic designer and educator from Canada who left the cold of
her home country this year to seek new skills and gain a greater perspective
within her work. Her driving ambition is to humanise technology and bring in
elements of spirituality and enlightenment to the digital design process. Her
work explores how technology can be used to enhance ones mind, body and spirit.</p>
<p>Lee-Ann’s
final project is an exploration of the breath by creating an interactive journey
through digital imagery. She will be creating an immersive experience that will
enhance the awareness of ones own vital function by utilising elements of
photography, sound and video.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>David
Evans Bailey is an artist engaging in the Hyperreal. He mixes metaphor with
imagery to create an often surprising series of simulations. It is the ‘not’
real, the larger than real and the unreal that drives his work. His engagement
is with the physical merging with the digital and beyond. His inspiration comes
from the theories of Jean Baudrillard (1981). David’s post-modernist
simulations make bold use of colour and saturation to create a contextual space
in which is imposed his order, the order of the ‘simulacra’ and of
hyperreality.</p>

<p>Pablo
Alvarez Murillo - NARCISSUS.<span>  Alone. He
is finally alone with his fears and dreads. Only a mirror proves to be to him
the one who is, whom it faces. Amid the thick darkness he stares at himself
when suddenly the reflection of his skin, mouth and eyes begins to deform. And thinks
he recognises all those terrifying images that crosses his face as a projector
onto a cinema. </span></p>
<p>Now
he realises; what seemed to be a mirror is simply another screen, similar to
that of the computer of his office or to that of the telephone that he keeps in
his coat. </p>
<p>———</p>
<p>Cindy
Wang is a Digital Media Arts (MA) student. Her final project is called ‘Swing
in the sky’. It is a physical interactive installation based on swing. Through
the use of digital technology and computer code, the participant wanders
back-and-forth through the clouds to the rhythm of their swing, whilst loosing
themselves within atmospheric music.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>Adelina,
a girl from China(中國). Her final project
presents a window on Chinese culture, in particular Hanzi (漢字),
Chinese traditional Chinese characters used in the writing of Chinese and other
Asian languages. Her work challenges you to imitate and engage in the Chinese
characters practice (書法練習) to give an
insight into traditional Chinese culture. The greater the similarity, the more you
will be rewarded.</p>

<p>James
Shreeve. The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.</p>
<p>The
replicant known as James Shreeve may appear to have all the hallmarks and
traits of the standard human artist yet there is some spectacular programing behind
those emerald green eyes. He has learned to assimilate and become a member of
the artistic community even though it went against his beta programing. Some
time ago his operating system was corrupted by a creative virus of patterns but
now the pattern process permeates through his very existence. It could be said
that the mind of James is hardwired to see through the trappings of world and
gaze at the patterns which control the system </p>
<p>———</p>
<p>Jon
Sayce is fascinated by the ingenuity of the natural world and draws much of his
inspiration from the wonders of nature. With a background in design and
graphics, his journey has been one of exploration into creative digital possibilities
that blur edges between the natural and artificial.</p>

<p>Frog Wing is installing an 8-foot tall Molecule-orb in Jixiang Village!</p>
<p>You can participate by contributing to this fundraiser, or passing it along to others who might be interested!</p>
<p>————————————</p>
<p>MORE INFO:</p>
<p>Dodecahedrons have long been considered symbols of the Universe and depictions of the Divine, by various nations and cultures all over the world. </p>
<p>Lijiang Dongba identify Frog’s dodecahedral Molecule-Orbs as meditation tools that connect and resonate with higher realms. Pentagonal faces recall the five elements, while twelve faces reference the signs of the Zodiac. The Orbs also symbolize blessing and protection, bestowed from the giver and onto the receiver. </p>
<p>The installation of a large dodecahedron in Jixiang Village takes form as a gift- from Frog, WuZhimi and supporting Dongba, and all those who donate to the cause. Rather than gifting individuals with singular molecule-orbs each, installing a large-scale dodecahedron allows all villagers and passersby to contemplate and enjoy the beauty of this particular platonic solid, up-close and in-person. </p>
<p>We plan to hold a community Opening Event after the Orb is finished- tentatively synchronized to Summer Solstice (June 21st). Accompanying installation, three local Dongba shaman-priests will be present to conduct a blessing ritual for Lashihai lake valley and Jixiang Village (recipients of the Orb).</p>
<p>After the ritual is complete, the Jixiang Orb and its installation will be archived as Dongba-endorsed object and ritual event. A steel placard bolted into a cement base features short prayer inscribed in English, Chinese, and Naxi Dongba pictograms. This serves to bring Lashihai and Jixiang Village good luck and fortune in the future, as well as ward off malevolent spirits.</p>
<p>———————</p>
<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>The Jixiang Orb is a large-scale steel sculpture. Dongba intention suggests that it also provides blessing and protection for its receivers. We hope that these intentions will eventually manifest in tangible, valuable ways.</p>
<p>In the past decade, outside developers have constantly sought to profit off Lashihai’s natural resources. After seizing acres of land from local farmers with little-to-no compensation in return, government-approved operations move in and capitalize with get-rich-quick schemes. Following the awkward peach fields (2006-2008), there have been plans to raze the villages and turn them into golf courses (2009: thankfully canceled), construction of a luxury resort by the lakeside (2012), and most recently, the development of an entire horse-racing track as a short-term scam operation (2015). </p>
<p>Dongba practice continues on today in Lijiang, as living proof of their ancient heritage. Although the Naxi peoples in Lashihai may have lost their Dongba traditions since the Cultural Revolution, others in the hills and mountainous areas have retained it; They now bring it back to the cities in a renewed, modern effort of preservation. Dongba culture is evolving with its peoples, adapting to Lijiang’s globalized climate. Participation of local Dongba priests in the installation of the Jixiang Orb promotes Dongba religion returning to Lashihai through an officially sanctionable activity, as well as leaving lasting physical proof for future reference. Crowdsourced funding online adds an extra element of connectivity- It highlights that local people have community support that extends beyond the geographical boundaries of Lashihai lake valley. This can be valuable as leverage for commercial and political exchanges in the future. </p>
<p>So, in addition to raising funds for the construction of a giant holy steel ball, you will be contributing your vote to protect Lashihai lake valley and its inhabitants from potential future bullying by corporate entities, foreign investors, government developers and the like.</p>
<p>And yes, you will also be helping to build a really big version of those little molecule-orbs! By expanding the scale and scope by which pieces are made, Frog is adding new connections and skills to the toolbox- gifts that will be retained and translated in an artist's overall career.</p>
<p>When finished, the Jixiang Village Orb becomes a repository of energy. Its presence serves as a physical representation of group support for community cooperation, empowerment for farming populations and indigenous tribes, and the belief that global friendships can strengthen and empower communities on a grassroots level. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are asking for $1600 to fund the complete operation, and this is how funds will be distributed:</p>
<p>$1000: cost of materials, labor, transportation, and installment of the orb, its base, and final placard</p>
<p>$200: to host a community gathering and invite local Dongba for blessing/ protection ritual on Opening Day</p>
<p>$200: to seek official recognition and endorsement from Lijiang organizations and groups (such as the Dongba Research Institute), as an effort to protect Lashihai and its land from foreign developers and commercial investors in the future</p>
<p>$200: to cover fees, materials/ labor for perks, shipping/handling, and miscellany (such as transportation costs and other human needs that arise during the project duration)</p>
<p>——————————</p>
<p>In exchange for your donation, you receive a postcard of thanks in the mail, and your name added to the list of contributors. List of names will appear on a permanent plate at base of Orb (optional), and possibly in future events that this piece is referenced in (at least one coming up later this year, in NYC). </p>
<p>If you donate more than $10, you will also receive other tokens of appreciation, in the form of art objects made by Frog Wing (/Wu Zhimi). </p>

Its presence serves as a physical representation of group support for community cooperation, empowerment for farming populations and indigenous tribes, and the belief that global friendships can strengthen and empower communities on a grassroots level. 
What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $1600 to fund the complete operation, and this is how funds will be distributed:
$1000: cost of materials, labor, transportation, and installment of the orb, its base, and final placard
$200: to host a community gathering and invite local Dongba for blessing/ protection ritual on Opening Day
$200: to seek official recognition and endorsement from Lijiang organizations and groups (such as the Dongba Research Institute), as an effort to protect Lashihai and its land from foreign developers and commercial investors in the future
$200: to cover fees, materials/ labor for perks, shipping/handling, and miscellany (such as transportation costs and other human needs that arise during the project duration)
——————————
In exchange for your donation, you receive a postcard of thanks in the mail, and your name added to the list of contributors. List of names will appear on a permanent plate at base of Orb (optional), and possibly in future events that this piece is referenced in (at least one coming up later this year, in NYC). 
If you donate more than $10, you will also receive other tokens of appreciation, in the form of art objects made by Frog Wing (/Wu Zhimi).

enrichment in central Middletown – the Gateway to Lake County. 
MAC will fill a need for art and culture in a rural county that 
is lacking in such opportunities for residents and artists alike. It will provide a 
unique
cultural environment in which people of all ages, abilities, and levels of artistic 
experience can
feel free to imagine, express, create, and welcome the visual arts into 
their lives.  Through art, MAC will enhance participants' creative, 
intellectual and
personal growth and sense of well-being.  It will contribute to 
sustainable cultural and economic development in
our region and promote engagement and investment in our small towns, our businesses and our communities – so that together, we thrive!Art Resource: The
Center will be an art resource for community members and artists.  We 
will offer a broad range of art classes, workshops, events and 
activities for all ages - children, teens, students, adults & 
seniors - in a variety of media from traditional to digital. Teaching 
and exhibition opportunities as well as professional services such as 
portfolio review, consulting and marketing will be available 
to artists. For membership info please visit our website.
Location:  MAC is located at the junction of Hwys 
175 and 29, in a 2400 sq ft interior space requiring renovation. It will
become exhibition space in the front, and education space in the back. The 
lot adjacent to the road will be beautified and showcase outdoor
sculptures, providing an energized and attractive cornerstone for our 
community.Premiere ~ Opening Reception 3/28/15Your contribution will help us make this vision a sustainable reality! We

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Currently ranked #33 worldwide by the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), the Nashville Rollergirls All Stars are heading to Asheville, NC in just a few short weeks for WFTDA Division One Playoffs... but we need your help to get there!

<h3>How Much Could It Cost To Play Roller Derby Anyway?</h3>
<p>The Nashville Rollergirls are an all-volunteer, skater-run 501(c)3 non-profit organization, and skaters have to pay out of pocket to play and travel. Roller derby is an expensive sport! Did you know that it costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100 for each skater to get a set of blue and white team jerseys</li>
<li>$50 for a shiny team helmet painted in NRG blue</li>
<li>Anywhere from $300-500 per person to travel to each game out of state</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to mention, every skater pays more than $400 in dues each year to help keep the lights on in our practice space, and a full set of skates, knee pads, elbow pads, wrist guards, mouth guard, wheels and bearings can add up to over $700 per skater.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Sarah Duyer and I am a ceramic artist and illustrator based in San Francisco, CA. </p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be offered a work-study scholarship to attend a workshop at <a href=""http://penland.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Penland School of Craft</a> this summer where I will be taking a 2-week class on ceramic surface design. While the scholarship is very generous and covers my room and board and part of my tuition it will still be difficult for me to afford the remaining costs. </p>
<p>In the 10 years that I've been working in clay I've had many teachers and mentors tell me about their time at Penland and every one has expressed just how transformational and influential their experience was on their work. Since graduating from the University of Delaware with my BFA in 2012 I have continued to develop my own artistic style and gain experience in a variety of different studio settings. I feel I would greatly benefit from being back in a classroom and building on the knowledge and experience I have and am excited to learn new skills and meet other artists who share my love of clay.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While the work-study scholarship does cover a significant amount of the cost to attend I need help raising the rest. I am responsible for covering the rest of my tuition and travel expenses and taking into account that I would need to miss two weeks of work (without paid time off) the financial burden is more than I can comfortably cover on my own. </p>
<p>My estimated expenses for this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuition: $650</li>
<li>Travel: $900</li>
<li>Materials and production costs: $500</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the direct costs of attending I have to consider the loss of income for 2 weeks (from both my day job and my own small business) and the cost of covering home and studio rent while I'm away. </p>
<p>Instead of creating a page for donations I wanted to have handmade rewards available for those who help me fund my trip!</p>
<p>Here are some of the rewards that I am offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticker sheet with 7 die-cut stickers </li>
<li>""Cute Butt"" trophy enamel pin</li>
<li>Ceramic trophy or pot magnets </li>
<li>Custom ceramic trophies (available in small and large)</li>
<li>Custom ceramic lighting</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>From what former Penland students have told me attending a workshop is an invaluable experience for an artist at any point in their career. I see ceramics as a lifelong learning experience and, while I have worked in clay for nearly a decade, there are so many aspects of the medium I have yet to explore. </p>
<p>In the workshop that I'l be attending I will be learning new techniques for surface design and gain experience in firing a salt kiln. I have been developing my work on my own since graduating but I am excited to be a student again and be able to incorporate what I learn at Penland into my own studio practice. </p>

</div><div>
<p>I have already paid my deposit for the workshop so I am 100% committed to attending Penland! I would have attended with or without your help but contributing to this campaign would help prevent me from taking on more debt.</p>
<p>I have a dedicated studio space in San Francisco and shouldn't have a problem fulfilling all the reward tiers, though the custom ceramic pieces will likely take longer to complete. Sticker sheets have already been made and production time on enamel pins is only a few weeks so those items would likely ship soon after the campaign ends. Ceramic pieces will likely ship 1-3 months after my Penland session, depending on the complexity and my workload between now and then.</p>

Through dance, street art, and live music the production will point out the opposition between overabundance of information, distraction, and social isolation caused by new technologies and the human being connected to his environment, to nature and to himself.<br/> </p><p><strong>         WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p><p align=""left"" style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Pour financer cette production artistique significative et innovante, notre objectif est de récolter 1000 €.

Nous sommes distraits par nos smartphones et nous en oublions parfois notre environnement, intérieur et extérieur. En dépit des aspects positifs et des progrès indéniables générés par ces outils de communication, nous ne pouvons ignorer les conséquences négatives. Nous avons décidé de travailler sur la “surabondance” d’information, la distraction et l’isolation sociale.AloneTogether est une production en soirée qui tente d'explorer et de repenser la relation entre la technologie et l'humanité en utilisant de multiples formes d'art. A travers la danse et le corps nous souhaitons mettre en opposition: la surabondance d’information, la distraction, et l’isolation sociale provoquées par les nouvelles technologies et l’Homme connecté à son environnement, à la nature et à lui- même. Cette performance artistique sera accompagnée de street art et de musique live.We increasingly often walk through this world with our heads down, immersed in a technological realm and increasingly disregarding our (real and immediate) surrounding. We fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a deep solitude.AloneTogether is an evening filling production that tries to explore and rethink the relationship between technology and humanity in using multiple artistic art forms. Through dance, street art, and live music the production will point out the opposition between overabundance of information, distraction, and social isolation caused by new technologies and the human being connected to his environment, to nature and to himself.          WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETPour financer cette production artistique significative et innovante, notre objectif est de récolter 1000 €. En décidant de devenir donateur de AloneTogether, votre contribution soutiendra directement le financement de la réalisation artistique. Comme l'indique le graphique ci-dessous, votre don facilite et assure les cachets des artistes, les locaux de répétition, la location de salles, la communication et les tentatives de diffusion. Quelle que soit l'ampleur de votre contribution, elle sera dépensée avec soin pour faire une différence significative dans cette production et pour toutes les personnes impliquées.To fund this meaningful and innovative artistic production we aim to raise €1000. By deciding to become a donor of AloneTogether, your contribution will directly support the financing of the artistic realization. As the graph below indicates, your donation facilitates and ensures artists fees, rehearsal space, venue rental and communication, and outreach attempts. No matter the scope of your contribution, it will be spent with care to make a meaningful difference to this production and all involved. En guise de récompense pour votre soutien, nous avons préparé des avantages vraiment intéressants pour chaque niveau de contribution. Il s'agit notamment d'un wallpaper de téléphone surprise, de billets pour le spectacle lui-même, d'une série limitée d'un jeu de cartes postales et d'un tote bag. Et, bien sûr, nous remercierons tous avec respect et nos meilleurs vœux !As a reward for your support, we prepared some really great perks for every level of contribution. These include a surprised wallpaper, tickets to the performance itself, a limited series of a postcard set and a tote bag. And, surely, we will thank each and everyone with respect and our best wishes!SOME OF OUR ARTISTNos danseurs: Marion Agosta et Frédéric Jean-BaptisteFrédéric Jean-Baptiste a commencé la danse à 22 ans. Ce n'est qu'après deux années de cours intensifs, qu'il intègrera la Comédie Musicale ""Roméo et Juliette "" en 2000 et qu'il fit son entrée dans le monde du Spectacle. De fil en aiguilles, Frédéric travaillera à la télévision avec REDHA, Mia FRYE, Bruno VANDELLI, Laura TREVES, Bill GOODSON, HI-HAT pour ne citer qu'eux.Diplômé d'Etat en danse jazz (2003), Frédéric se découvre une réelle passion pour l'enseignement. Il enseigne le Jazz depuis 10 ans aujourd'hui. Jazz qu'il définit et qu'il nourrit avec les danses ""urbaines"" comme ""New-Jazz"". Car, il garde l'énergie et la technique ""jazz"" en l'enrichissant"" d'influences street jazz, de Voguing, de Newstyle et de Hip hop ,le tout .... avec du travail de sol, qu'il affectionne tout particulièrement.https://www.instagram.com/fredericjeanbaptiste/www.fredjeanbaptiste.comMarion Agosta est une danseuse professionelle aux influences moderne et street jazz. Elle aime s'enrichir de nouveaux styles et explorer divers univers.https://www.instagram.com/marion_ag/Our dancers: Marion Agosta and Frédéric Jean-BaptisteFrédéric Jean-Baptiste started dancing at the age of 22. It was only after two years of intensive courses that he joined the ""Romeo and Juliet"" Musical Comedy in 2000 and made his entry into the world of the Show. From needle to needle, Frederic will work on television with REDHA, Mia FRYE, Bruno VANDELLI, Laura TREVES, Bill GOODSON, HI-HAT to name but a few.As a graduate of the State Diploma in Jazz Dance (2003), Frédéric discovered a real passion for teaching. He has been teaching Jazz for 10 years now. Jazz that he defines and nourishes with ""urban"" dances like ""New-Jazz"". Because, he keeps the energy and technique ""jazz"" by enriching it"" with street jazz, Voguing, Newstyle and Hip-hop influences... all with soil work, which he particularly likes.https://www.instagram.com/fredericjeanbaptiste/www.fredjeanbaptiste.comBUST the DRIP est un artiste français issu de l’univers de la danse. Formé au hip hop, il fait partie du groupe Fush Wong.Ce sont les vibrations de la musique qui l’animent. Recréant le mouvement des corps, il associe le geste à la projection de peinture. Inspiré autant par Pollock, que par Mode2, sa manière de peindre est extrêmement gestuelle, énergique ; à la fois technique et instinctive. Ses compositions mêlent spray, acrylique, crayon... Il parle de sa peinture comme d’une chorégraphie de traits et de traces. La couleur prend forme, les fréquences dessinées donnent le rythme. Calé sur ses vibrations, l’artiste renvoie son tempo sur son support.https://www.instagram.com/bust_the_drip/WHEN?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My Senior Thesis Exhibition Show will be based on the ideas and work I have been creating and exploring for around 2 years now. My work deals with a metaphysical self-awareness through relationships and connections with others and the environment. I use sculptural wearables, live models, video, performance, and interactive objects to convey these ideas. </p>
<p>While attending Montserrat College of Art full-time, I also work three part-time jobs. This means that my time is limited and precious. My Senior Thesis Exhibition show will be happening sometime after March and in order to produce the work I need in time, I am looking for some help with purchasing materials. More importantly, because much of my work relies on models and performers, I want to be sure to pay the people who work for me. This way, I can guarantee their commitment to my show and be sure to compensate them fairly. And lastly, I am asking for your help so that I can have my Senior Thesis show professionally documented. This work will be what I use to propel myself as an artist once I graduate. I will need quality photos and videos (for performance) to use for my website and professional applications once I leave school. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Any financial contribution that you can provide will go directly to one of these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Materials:</strong> I use a lot of fabric, wood, and lighting in my work. These materials can become quit costly. Your contributions will help me get the quality materials I need in order to create my best work for my show. </li>
<li>
<strong>Models &amp; Performers: </strong>As of now, I am looking to hire around 5-8 performers and models to do <u>two</u> performances, and model <u>two</u> or <u>three</u> wearable sculptures for the duration of the show. I Intend to offer each performer $50.00 and each model $25.00 for their time. </li>
<li>
<strong>Documentation:</strong> I intend to hire somebody to take photographs and video of my work during my senior show. Having quality documentation will help me propel myself as an independent artist once I graduate. </li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on your contribution to my campaign, you will have a few ""perks"" to choose from!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With big projects and ideas comes lots of planning, lots of failing, but most importantly, lots of learning. Taking on a project that requires so much fundraising, planning, and work <i>outside of </i>the actual conceptual challenges, my other work-heavy courses, my three jobs, and well, everything else life throws at us, will not be an easy feat. But I intend to graduate with a bang and create the work I have been running towards for quite some time now. Even if this campaign does not reach it's goal, or I run into other issues along the way, any funds I receive will go directly towards everything listed above and I will still give 110% effort and energy to putting on the best show possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that you have your own things to pay for, and that there are <i>a lot </i>of worthy causes out there, so anything you can contribute is helpful (that's what crowdfunding is all about anyway!) But if you cannot donate today, there a couple other things you can do to help, which are just as appreciated:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Share my campaign page:</strong> Maybe somebody you know is a lover of the arts and would like to contribute!</li>
<li>
<strong>Follow me on instagram: </strong>@roisingilligan If you're interested in what I am doing, I am keeping an active presence on instagram during the semester, and afterwards!</li>
<li>
<strong>Perform for me:</strong> I am always looking for committed performers and models for my work. No experience necessary, just contact me at roisin.gilligan@montserrat.edu with the subject: <i>Performance Interest</i>, and let me know that you're interested and I will add you to my performer list!</li>

<p>I am T.H. Johnson, whose interest as the CEO of Texas Gulf Atlantic and its Entertainment Division, is to present quality motion pictures and documentaries to the public that rarely, if ever, are told.  Consider one of our major upcoming projects, ""The Music Maker"", it is a biographical movie, that I personally witnessed as a radio advertising executive in Minneapolis in the mid-1970s.  The story centers around a fascinating character and how his idea to make this unlikely frigid northern US city of Minneapolis, and its unlikely minority community, into a music production center starting with his first progeny of his company, the artist known as Prince.   </p>
<p>The foundation of this movie is music, it is the progeny of other templates that were musically driven like Saturday Night Fever or Superfly, the latter returned approximately 100 to 1 for each dollar of initial investment.  $30 Million Dollars was the return for its $300 thousand dollar budget.  That was a remarkable return for such a low budgeted movie.  However, its musical soundtrack Superfly produced by Curtis Mayfield generated a return of  300 to 1 for its music and grossed over $30 Million Dollars itself.  The Movie Maker is simply one of several in this genre that utilized the same template for success, including the original SHAFT starring Richard Roundtree in 1971, academy award winning soundtrack by Isaac Hayes that produced respectable ROI profits.  We also have the motion picture PURPLE RAIN whose movie ROI was approximately 11 to 1, and its original musical soundtrack in 1984 by Prince returned an astounding 2000 to 1 ROI in gross profits with a return over the years of approximately $150 million in album sales.  The Grand Daddy of them all was SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER whose movie gross and music soundtrack album gross returned equal amounts of approximately $350 million dollars a piece for a grand total of approximately  $700 million dollars.   The estimated investment for production was approximately $10 Million Dollars by RSO (the Robert Stigwood Organization) label and production company.  The Music Maker we predict can and will do the same.</p>
<p>We also have a strong interest under the TGA umbrella in producing exciting documentaries as well.  Consider the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">story based on true events in  the infamous OJ Simpson case, in a 2004 documentary entitled SERPENTS RISING: An Independent Investigation of  the infamous OJ Simpson case, (</span><a href=""http://www.serpentsrising.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">www.serpentsrising.com</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">)  and the alleged evidence that culminated in the ""Trial of the Century"" back in June of 1994 through October of 1995.    The revelations of several independent investigators reveal several unknown things about a cover up in this infamous trial when all these heretofore unknown investigators working over the last 20 years are brought together.   In order to promote a popular narrative of OJ Simpson's guilt, sworn court officers on both sides of the table would enter an unholy alliance to conceal other documents that pointed away from Mr. Simpson, using a friendly judge to aid and abet the suppression of these documents.  Though we have gained access to these documents, they officially remain sealed and off-limits to the public, sealed by the same judge per the request of the District Attorney's office on at least three occasions over three years.  Those sealed files would provide a strong public argument that Mr. Simpson was not involved in the murders for which he is charged and that authorities knew this from the very beginning.  This is the basis of the subsequently planned title of the documentary whose working title is LEGACY OF DECEPTION, taken from and named after the most important book and thriller concealed from the public on the subject of corruption in the Simpson case, written by Denver author Stephen Singular.</span></p>
<p>We are attempting to raise  a significant portion of the $15 million dollars to fund the production of these projects at a top level, requiring quality directors, and actors.  However, we believe that these movies will do well in making a profit in the domestic and international marketplace.   Raising capital to produce anything is always a challenge, but there are ways to put all financial incentives together to reach our goal.   So even if we do not get all the way to our goal by contributions, we can potentially leverage what we do have combined with debt capital.  </p>

I am T.H. Johnson, whose interest as the CEO of Texas Gulf Atlantic and its Entertainment Division, is to present quality motion pictures and documentaries to the public that rarely, if ever, are told.  Consider one of our major upcoming projects, ""The Music Maker"", it is a biographical movie, that I personally witnessed as a radio advertising executive in Minneapolis in the mid-1970s.  The story centers around a fascinating character and how his idea to make this unlikely frigid northern US city of Minneapolis, and its unlikely minority community, into a music production center starting with his first progeny of his company, the artist known as Prince.   
The foundation of this movie is music, it is the progeny of other templates that were musically driven like Saturday Night Fever or Superfly, the latter returned approximately 100 to 1 for each dollar of initial investment.  $30 Million Dollars was the return for its $300 thousand dollar budget.  That was a remarkable return for such a low budgeted movie.  However, its musical soundtrack Superfly produced by Curtis Mayfield generated a return of  300 to 1 for its music and grossed over $30 Million Dollars itself.  The Movie Maker is simply one of several in this genre that utilized the same template for success, including the original SHAFT starring Richard Roundtree in 1971, academy award winning soundtrack by Isaac Hayes that produced respectable ROI profits.  We also have the motion picture PURPLE RAIN whose movie ROI was approximately 11 to 1, and its original musical soundtrack in 1984 by Prince returned an astounding 2000 to 1 ROI in gross profits with a return over the years of approximately $150 million in album sales.  The Grand Daddy of them all was SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER whose movie gross and music soundtrack album gross returned equal amounts of approximately $350 million dollars a piece for a grand total of approximately  $700 million dollars.   The estimated investment for production was approximately $10 Million Dollars by RSO (the Robert Stigwood Organization) label and production company.  The Music Maker we predict can and will do the same.
We also have a strong interest under the TGA umbrella in producing exciting documentaries as well.  Consider the story based on true events in  the infamous OJ Simpson case, in a 2004 documentary entitled SERPENTS RISING: An Independent Investigation of  the infamous OJ Simpson case, (www.serpentsrising.com)  and the alleged evidence that culminated in the ""Trial of the Century"" back in June of 1994 through October of 1995.    The revelations of several independent investigators reveal several unknown things about a cover up in this infamous trial when all these heretofore unknown investigators working over the last 20 years are brought together.   In order to promote a popular narrative of OJ Simpson's guilt, sworn court officers on both sides of the table would enter an unholy alliance to conceal other documents that pointed away from Mr. Simpson, using a friendly judge to aid and abet the suppression of these documents.  Though we have gained access to these documents, they officially remain sealed and off-limits to the public, sealed by the same judge per the request of the District Attorney's office on at least three occasions over three years.  Those sealed files would provide a strong public argument that Mr. Simpson was not involved in the murders for which he is charged and that authorities knew this from the very beginning.  This is the basis of the subsequently planned title of the documentary whose working title is LEGACY OF DECEPTION, taken from and named after the most important book and thriller concealed from the public on the subject of corruption in the Simpson case, written by Denver author Stephen Singular.
We are attempting to raise  a significant portion of the $15 million dollars to fund the production of these projects at a top level, requiring quality directors, and actors.  However, we believe that these movies will do well in making a profit in the domestic and international marketplace.   Raising capital to produce anything is always a challenge, but there are ways to put all financial incentives together to reach our goal.   So even if we do not get all the way to our goal by contributions, we can potentially leverage what we do have combined with debt capital.  
We also have an incentive on one of our films to receive at least 1/3 of the cost by check rebated back with the success in receiving a film tax credit from the State of Kentucky if we choose to produce the movie ""The Music Maker"" there.

<h3>Calling all humans, aliens, and all other sentinel beings!</h3>
<p>We need your help getting our flying saucer to Burning Man.  We are a colony of conscious expanding creatures hailing from the greater Lake Tahoe-Portland-Salt Lake City-Florida region of Earth who have a strong passion for creating.  However in a parallel world, we are actually aliens from an underwater planet called Tahoepia.  Earlier this year, we were able to find a 1984 Dodge dually flatbed truck that is perfect for transorming into an art car.  Therefore, we brought back this Earth transportation device to the Laughing Orgasmic Galactic Information Committee (LOGIC) located here in Tahoepia to see what we should do.  </p>
<p>The heads of LOGIC decided that to absolutely blow people's minds at Burning Man, we needed to convert this '84 Dodge into a LOGIC approved flying saucer.  LOGIC named this vehicle the <em>S.S. Carcharius</em> (Latin for Great White Shark). For this to be LOGIC approved, we have to extend the bed in all directions to make room for dancing Burners, construct a bar to quench the thirst of the desert dwellers, create sonic bliss for the aliens to shake their booties all night long to, laser-cut medallions, and of course purchase some shooting-star-bright LED's to spin the aircraft at night.</p>
<p>Our goal is to shower people with love and laughter while on board the <em>S.S. Carcharius</em>.  Our ship will be a steady flow of good vibrations portaling the spirit of Burning Man to all on board.  We will share our love, heart, souls, and lives with all beings who come into contact with the ship.  The positivity will therefore transpire back out of Burning Man back into the ""other"" world and have a butterfly effect on all.</p>
<h3>The Dollars Broken Down</h3>
<p>The Dodge itself cost us $950 but we here in Tahoe were able to split that about 6 ways, so don't worry about that.  We also were able to weld most of our frame/platform out of free scrap metal we picked up around town.  And a big thanks to Andy Warren for providing a PA/Soundsystem.</p>
<p>However, we need funds for:</p>
<p>Wood - $200</p>
<p>Aluminet (Fabric to shape body) - $700</p>
<p>LED's - $700</p>
<p>DJ Equipment - $500</p>
<p>Pendants - $540</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Gifts for giving!</h3>
<p>$25 will get you a big ass hug from me the next time I see you and a warm squishy feeling knowing that you contributed to thousands of laughs and smiles. It just might also get you a S.S. Carcharius trinket of some nature (beer coozie, pin, sticker).</p>
<p>$75 will get you either a <em>S.S. Carcharius </em>pendant (if going to BM) or a <em>S.S. Carcharius </em>T-shirt if not attending.  Having either of these two objects on your person will surely make you feel a sense of joy and could be the beginning of many intriguing conversations.</p>
<p><strong>- Campmates -</strong> This is what the LOGIC (Laughing Orgasmic Galactic Information Committee) is requesting as a minimum donation.  This ensures that you receive your <em>S.S.</em> Carcharius laser-cut pendant, which is your Tahoepian Alien Identification on board the vessel. This will guarantee your VIP experience on board the S.S. Carcharius.  If for some reason you cannot afford this, please start your very own Indiegogo project.  Just kidding, do what ya can and we'll still love ya.  You'll just have to do somehing on the playa to EARN your pendant.  Chuckle Chuckle.</p>
<p>$150 will get you the pendant and the T-shirt.</p>
<p>$300 will get you a custom designed <em>S.S. Carcharius</em> flying saucer hat as well as the pendant and T-shirt</p>
<p>$500 gets you all of the above plus the <em>S.S. Carcharius</em> orinal painting seen above. This radical piece is on a 24""x24"" canvas and will bring good alien energy to your home.  You will also be granted the power to tell every person who camps with us to do ONE funny thing while on board the <em>S.S. Carcharius.</em> The possibilities are endless with this one and we would be absoulutely honored to grant someone this power.  Think about it...</p>
<p>All donations will be documented and I will be having everybody email me their information to make sure that they receive whatever perk they have coming to them.  And remember, we all get what's coming to us in the end (:</p>

This book is a compilation of information I have provided my own customers over the years for how to not just care for blown glass, but how to display it expertly too!  At 27 pages, it includes information on glass composition in easy to read English explaining how blown glass is different from commercial glass.  In it I reveal something you already have in your kitchen that is better and cheaper than any of the commercial cleaners available for glass.  I explain how you can wash your glass tumblers in a dishwasher and what soap to use. I reveal an interesting way to clean glass that even uses NO cleaners AT ALL (and is one of the single best ways to keep glass clean, too!).  I have a chapter on how to display glass in the home using a range of different lighting techniques.  I  show you how you can determine the right amount of light for a glass piece without having to go to the expense of installing track lighting. This guide has 20 years of professional experience packed into it, the guide is sprinkled throughout with fun glass facts. <i>The Care And Feeding Of Blown Glass</i> is available in PDF format.  </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1101320/files/20141216141620-E-Book_Glass.jpg?1418768180"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Limited Edition Ornament!</b>  <br/></p><p></p><h3> </h3><br/><h3><ul>

My campaign wont work without the help of many people sharing as much as they can in order to spread the word!  <i><b>When you can bring me donors who saw your mention and acts on it, anyone who mentions your name in the comments section of the donation page, I will credit you with 15% of their donation, which is good towards any of the perks for the campaign! </b></i> If you were able to refer someone to me that wound up making a $1,000.00 donation, for example, that would mean that you would have a credit in your name in the amount of $150.00. Help this campaign go viral and you could benefit, too! <br/>
</li></ul><ul>
</ul><p><br/></p><ul>
</ul> <p> </p><h3>What Is Needed   <ul>
<li>The project cost is $5,600.00. This is a <i>fixed</i> campaign which means that I HAVE to reach my goal in order to get my funding.  If I reach the final day of the campaign and fall short by even one dollar, I do not get my amount.  I AM NOT taking Flex funding for this campaign.  If I do not meet the goal, all money will be returned by Indiegogo. (Let's not let that happen, k?)<br/>
</li>
<li>Funding will be used to repair a furnace door, purchase 
propane,  electricity for the production period (December to January), 
colored glass supplies, shipping, base glass, freight, and production 
costs including printing, postage, packaging, and shipping. A production run of 20 works will be made during the production period for selling to galleries across the United States. However, all perks will be made first before the production begins for galleries. Getting donations above my budget will increase my reach and make a tight budget easier.  <br/>
</li>
<li>$200.00 is budgeted for a lamp lighting party 
scheduled for for donors on <i>Saturday January 17 </i> from 6:00-until? where I demonstrate the
 making of the pieces with food and beverages at the studio in Newport! 
Lamps will be set up for a dramatic reveal for this fun event!  Its a party, its some wintry fun in a hot glass studio!  <br/>
</li>
</ul> </h3><p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <ul><li>By donating, you 
will have helped a local business bring an innovative design to market while 
also opening the studio for others to enjoy our many other offerings during the holiday season.  Have you seen the many new works 
that have emerged over the last year?  Oh my goodness!  Check it out on our Facebook page under stafford art glass!  Every year I have dozens of people coming to blow their ornaments at the studio.  My winter events have spread by word of mouth and this program will help make sure that we have hot glass in the New River Valley!  <br/>
</li></ul> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>The 
challenges of this campaign are to build a <i>larger community</i> of engaged 
enthusiasts who are ready to become a partner in the process of success!  Who knew
 word of mouth could be so much fun? I can't hope to achieve any of these things without your willingness to help, which is in getting the word out.  Simple!  This wont cost you a dime and you will be doing more than you know to help push the effort forward.  Share on facebook, send out an email to your friends which is a more personal way of sharing what's up in your life and in your community.  <br/>
</li>
<li>This means that in the following weeks  I will be motivating <i>thousands</i>
 of people to help in getting the word out, via social media platforms, television, radio, and our newspapers.  Two years ago I leveraged 
social media to get the word out about an exhibit of glass by my University students.  Within a 
<i>two-hour period</i> we had over 2,000 views of our announcement for the 
exhibit with many hundreds in the days that followed.  This led to our 
effort being featured in the Radford University Magazine.  Helping me is not all about just giving money, not by a long shot!   This leads me to the many ways you can help beyond just 
donating....</li>
</ul> <p></p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul>
<li>Want
 to help but can't donate?  No problem!  I can't tell you just how powerful having a core of devotees who are willing to keep my efforts shared and churning across the internet!  With just one simple click of the mouse, you can  have a big impact. just share my updates on your social media, twitter, 
instagram, and email! If you want to know how you can best do that, send me a
 note or a message and I can provide you with images for the campaign 
that you can use to your hearts content!  Find me on <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lighting-the-lamp-an-innovation-in-lighting/x/9122044"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook HERE</a>!
 Feel free to grab any image of me and my work on Facebook for use in spreading 
the word!  Have a group you'd like for me to speak to? Sometimes people 
just need a simple introduction from you about a business that you 
like.  A ""handshake"" is as valuable as a donation! Anyone who mentions YOUR name when they donate, will land you a credit that is equal to $15% of their donation! (Some limitations apply, so drop me a note to find out details or go to Facebook to find out more about this option.    <br/>
</li>
<li>Don't forget; Indiegogo has some great tools that make sharing a snap! Share away and let's make this happen!</li>

This book is a compilation of information I have provided my own customers over the years for how to not just care for blown glass, but how to display it expertly too!  At 27 pages, it includes information on glass composition in easy to read English explaining how blown glass is different from commercial glass.  In it I reveal something you already have in your kitchen that is better and cheaper than any of the commercial cleaners available for glass.  I explain how you can wash your glass tumblers in a dishwasher and what soap to use. I reveal an interesting way to clean glass that even uses NO cleaners AT ALL (and is one of the single best ways to keep glass clean, too!).  I have a chapter on how to display glass in the home using a range of different lighting techniques.  I  show you how you can determine the right amount of light for a glass piece without having to go to the expense of installing track lighting. This guide has 20 years of professional experience packed into it, the guide is sprinkled throughout with fun glass facts. The Care And Feeding Of Blown Glass is available in PDF format.  Limited Edition Ornament!   

Donate $26.00 and own your very own signed and 
numbered limited edition Christmas 2014 ornament!  Made with clear crystal and golden murine elements (an 
Italian cane technique), this design fuses old world sensibilities with a
 contemporary flair.  My cane design reacts with the atmosphere of the furnace
 to create a metallic effect that is elegant and stunning!  Great gift 
to give or keep!  Order multiples for family and friends!  Do you need 
it shipped? You are covered with our shipped option!  Ornament 
comes gift boxed with a note about the campaign and how the gift will 
help to launch the studio's newest design.  It is a gift that gives 
twice!  



Donate $40.00 and  blow your own ornament/suncatcher at the 
studio after funding is complete (January 7th). 
Choose your colors, your design, and I show you how to make something 
amazing! Pick-up from the studio. (Image shown of student work, 2011). Children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult.  



Donate $45.00 and get your limited edition ornament 
(described in our first perk) shipped to you or to a friend within the 
Continental U.S. Signed, numbered and dated, the ornament comes in its 
own gift box with a note about the work and the campaign.  It is a gift 
that gives twice. 


Donate $95.00 and receive a small Gaia lamp, standing approximately 7"" tall, this lamp is excellent as a night light.  At this price you can send them to 
your friends and family! Standing at approximately 7"" tall, it is a scaled down version of the full sized example shown below. For pick up from the studio.  (See our shipping option below


Donate $115.00 and have your small Gaia lamp, same as the perk above, but shipped anywhere within the Continental United States.  Standing at approximately 7"" tall, it is a mini version of my larger lamp.  I call it a Gaia Night Light!


Donate $185.00 and receive your own large Gaia lamp (above) shipped within 
the Continental U.S.!  Each piece is signed and dated by the artist with a
 card describing the campaign and a bio of the artist. These pieces are being offered at a special price through this campaign, which is 40% below retail.  


(Above: a collage of a few of our students over the last year who have blown glass in the studio)

Donate $500.00 and get your choice of a half-day glassblowing
 extravaganza with you and your friends:  I teach you how to blow as 
much glass as possible in a 5 hour period - ornaments, suncatchers, 
paperweights, or a bowl?  Its your choice!  Available during our 
production window between the second week of January to the third week of February 2015.  Can't 
make it personally to the studio?  Send me your design ideas and let's 
come up with stunning designs that will work for you!  All design work is guaranteed: I'm not happy unless you are. Either pick up from the studio or we can deduct enough from your donation total to include shipping! Free consultations are included to get you started when you choose to have designs made for you.





Donate $1,000.00 and work with me to design your own 
collection of custom made creations for any number of objects that equal
 your donation amount.  A new glass sink?  Your very own tumblers, bowl,
 vase, and tea light?  The studio is your oyster!  You get to exercise 
your itch to create while you work with a glassblower in studio. Contact
 me about this option before donating to learn about the list of options
 possible so you can do everything you have been dreaming of. As with all work made through the studio, satisfaction is guaranteed:  I'm not happy until YOU are!  I am just a phone call away at (540)605-0034 on my mobile or email me any questions that you might have.  All consultations are free for this service.  
Want to help with the campaign but  short on funds?  If you are local, I will need help on packing and shipping glass in January, and am happy to make fair trades!  Spreading the word is as easy as a mouse click! My campaign wont work without the help of many people sharing as much as they can in order to spread the word!  When you can bring me donors who saw your mention and acts on it, anyone who mentions your name in the comments section of the donation page, I will credit you with 15% of their donation, which is good towards any of the perks for the campaign!  If you were able to refer someone to me that wound up making a $1,000.00 donation, for example, that would mean that you would have a credit in your name in the amount of $150.00. Help this campaign go viral and you could benefit, too! 


  What Is Needed   
The project cost is $5,600.00. This is a fixed campaign which means that I HAVE to reach my goal in order to get my funding.  If I reach the final day of the campaign and fall short by even one dollar, I do not get my amount.  I AM NOT taking Flex funding for this campaign.  If I do not meet the goal, all money will be returned by Indiegogo. (Let's not let that happen, k?)

Funding will be used to repair a furnace door, purchase 
propane,  electricity for the production period (December to January), 
colored glass supplies, shipping, base glass, freight, and production 
costs including printing, postage, packaging, and shipping. A production run of 20 works will be made during the production period for selling to galleries across the United States. However, all perks will be made first before the production begins for galleries. Getting donations above my budget will increase my reach and make a tight budget easier.  

$200.00 is budgeted for a lamp lighting party 
scheduled for for donors on Saturday January 17  from 6:00-until? where I demonstrate the
 making of the pieces with food and beverages at the studio in Newport! 
Lamps will be set up for a dramatic reveal for this fun event!  Its a party, its some wintry fun in a hot glass studio!  

   The Impact By donating, you 
will have helped a local business bring an innovative design to market while 
also opening the studio for others to enjoy our many other offerings during the holiday season.  Have you seen the many new works 
that have emerged over the last year?  Oh my goodness!  Check it out on our Facebook page under stafford art glass!  Every year I have dozens of people coming to blow their ornaments at the studio.  My winter events have spread by word of mouth and this program will help make sure that we have hot glass in the New River Valley!  
   The Challenges 
The 
challenges of this campaign are to build a larger community of engaged 
enthusiasts who are ready to become a partner in the process of success!  Who knew
 word of mouth could be so much fun? I can't hope to achieve any of these things without your willingness to help, which is in getting the word out.  Simple!  This wont cost you a dime and you will be doing more than you know to help push the effort forward.  Share on facebook, send out an email to your friends which is a more personal way of sharing what's up in your life and in your community.  

This means that in the following weeks  I will be motivating thousands
 of people to help in getting the word out, via social media platforms, television, radio, and our newspapers.  Two years ago I leveraged 
social media to get the word out about an exhibit of glass by my University students.  Within a 
two-hour period we had over 2,000 views of our announcement for the 
exhibit with many hundreds in the days that followed.  This led to our 
effort being featured in the Radford University Magazine.  Helping me is not all about just giving money, not by a long shot!   This leads me to the many ways you can help beyond just 
donating....
  Other Ways You Can Help 
Want
 to help but can't donate?  No problem!  I can't tell you just how powerful having a core of devotees who are willing to keep my efforts shared and churning across the internet!  With just one simple click of the mouse, you can  have a big impact. just share my updates on your social media, twitter, 
instagram, and email! If you want to know how you can best do that, send me a
 note or a message and I can provide you with images for the campaign 
that you can use to your hearts content!  Find me on Facebook HERE!
 Feel free to grab any image of me and my work on Facebook for use in spreading 
the word!  Have a group you'd like for me to speak to? Sometimes people 
just need a simple introduction from you about a business that you 
like.  A ""handshake"" is as valuable as a donation! Anyone who mentions YOUR name when they donate, will land you a credit that is equal to $15% of their donation! (Some limitations apply, so drop me a note to find out details or go to Facebook to find out more about this option.    

Don't forget; Indiegogo has some great tools that make sharing a snap! Share away and let's make this happen!

ideas, Mobius
creates space for rigorous dialogue around experimental art
practices.  We
are a group that also understands the value of research and
development to any process. In
2013, our archives were transferred to Tufts University where future
artists, historians, researchers, and the public will learn about the
work that our organization has and will continue to cultivate.

<p>
</p><p>
    Mobius has plays a significant role in the cultural heritage of Boston. For
nearly forty years we have provided a dedicated space for
experimentation. Thousands of artists have used this platform to
explore and challenge new forms of experimental art. Performance Art,
Sound Art, Early Video and Installation, Movement-Based Art, and Net Art have been
pioneered at Mobius.  Only now, (40 years later) are these forms  beginning to see popular acclaim in the art world and beyond. 
Mobius
has helped support the work of artists that have
contributed to the rise of these artistic forms over the last 40
years. With
your help, we can continue to provide space to
artists, across international and generational divides, to come
together to discover the next breakthrough in contempary art!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1220270/files/20150213160741-15712443380_fe56b7373e_b.jpg?1423872461"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Anna Wexler &amp; Catherine Tutter, ""Vessel for Haiti IV,"" 2014</i><p><i><br/></i></p><p>

	a survey of experimental art in Boston over the last 40 years through the lens of Mobius.






	Developing
	a strategic plan to acquire a new space. Mobius currently resides in
	a modest 300 square space.  The size of our current space limits
	many of our endeavors and how we are able to envision our future. 
	






	Still
	preserving a space for ARTISTIC
	BREAKTHROUGHS!


The
IMPACT of Mobius


    In
addition to providing opportunities for artists to test and shape
ideas, Mobius
creates space for rigorous dialogue around experimental art
practices.  We
are a group that also understands the value of research and
development to any process. In
2013, our archives were transferred to Tufts University where future
artists, historians, researchers, and the public will learn about the
work that our organization has and will continue to cultivate.   



    Mobius has plays a significant role in the cultural heritage of Boston. For
nearly forty years we have provided a dedicated space for
experimentation. Thousands of artists have used this platform to
explore and challenge new forms of experimental art. Performance Art,
Sound Art, Early Video and Installation, Movement-Based Art, and Net Art have been
pioneered at Mobius.  Only now, (40 years later) are these forms  beginning to see popular acclaim in the art world and beyond. 
Mobius
has helped support the work of artists that have
contributed to the rise of these artistic forms over the last 40
years. With
your help, we can continue to provide space to
artists, across international and generational divides, to come
together to discover the next breakthrough in contempary art!Anna Wexler & Catherine Tutter, ""Vessel for Haiti IV,"" 2014

[EN] Why “Murals”: The realization of a piece of “Public Art” has the power to speak without words, leaving people free to act concretely in their daily life contest, protecting the knowledge about unique personal skills, building up their self-trust and motivations.[IT] Perché i “Murales”: La realizzazione di un’opera d’arte ""pubblica"" ha il merito di metter tutti nelle condizioni di agire concretamente sul proprio contesto quotidiano facendo acquisire ai giovani e alla popolazione della città una rinnovata consapevolezza delle proprie capacità, smorzando così la mancanza di fiducia in sé e nelle potenzialità del proprio territorio.http://www.facebook.com/muralesenzafrontiere[EN] Who are the artists involved:Aleksandra Miciak (Poland)

our campaign you will help us buying colors & brushes and
all the logistic necessary materials . It will cover
production costs, as well as participants and artists travel expenses. 
At the end of
the project we are going to organize an exhibition of the children’s
sketches. We’ll also print a small photo book with the
documentation of the results of the artworks, that will include a list of the
names of everyone who has contributed with their donations. The translated versions will be
available at the offices of ''Circo all'InCirca'' in Udine & at ''Her Yerde Sanat'' in Mardin.
Main
goal is to collect €4,000. If we manage to have a bigger amount available,
we’ll  engage other artists, in order to
involve more children to take part in the workshops. If we will not reach the
final goal proposed, we are motivated to run the program anyway, realizing less
murals in proportion to the amount collected. If you believe in our project: we
are very happy to receive your support, to improve concretely in this
initiative![IT] Contribuisci alla realizzazione di Murales Senza Frontiere a Mardin: Offrendo il tuo sostegno alla campagna, contribuisci

inoltre le spese di produzione e il rimborso dei costi di trasporto dei partecipanti
e degli artisti.
A fine lavori sarà allestita una mostra dei disegni e
sarà stampato un piccolo libretto contenente le foto dei lavori dei
partecipanti come testimonianza diretta, che includerà i nomi di tutti quelli
che hanno contribuito al progetto con le loro donazioni. Le versioni tradotte
saranno disponibili in visione presso le sedi di “Circo all'InCirca” a Udine e
di ''Her Yerde Sanat'' a Mardin.
La somma che
ci prefiggiamo di raccogliere e` di 4000 euro, ma nell'ipotesi che superassimo la
quota prevista ci impegniamo ad impiegare le donazioni extra per coinvolgere
altri artisti e permettere così a più ragazzi di prendere parte alle attività
del laboratorio. 
Nell’ipotesi
inversa invece, saremo motivati comunque a proporre l’iniziativa, riducendo il numero dei murales relativamente alla somma ricavata. Se credi alla buona riuscita del progetto: siamo felici di ricevere il tuo gesto di generosita' contribuendo attivamente alla realizzazione della campagna!To Thank

<p>Formerly a symbol of immense urban waste, the Fresh Kills Landfill is being transformed into an enormous parkland that is destined to exemplify the values of ecological restoration and environmental sustainability. Part of that transformation includes a competition for a site-specific public artwork designed to operate as a source of clean energy for the city utility grid. This volume features many of the top submissions to the Land Art Generator Initiative, which aims to create sustainable design solutions that integrate art and technology into renewable energy infrastructure around the world.</p>
<p>The book draws a much-needed connection between the two critical issues of sustainable development—energy generation and waste management—highlighting solutions that address both problems at once, thereby creating economically beneficial hybrid utility installations.</p>
<p>CAROLINE KLEIN is an architect and freelance author and editor for international architectural magazines and publishing houses. THE LAND ART GENERATOR INITIATIVE, founded in 2010 by Elizabeth Monoian and Robert Ferry, brings together artists, architects, scientists, landscape architects, and engineers to advance sustainable design solutions for large-scale renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Artistic expression pleases the eye, soothes the soul, and provokes thought either in a gallery setting or one’s home.</p>
<p>The photographs I have created are an easy fit for the eye or the soul and they are images that one could notice in passing or ponder at length. They would fit well in many rooms in one’s home and they would provoke conversation among guests who visit.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What the Calder Series represents?</strong></p>
<p>I am a photographic artist and throughout my 40 plus years career as an instructor and an artist, I have made pictures of everyday subjects. I consider these photographs profound as light illuminates ordinary things and makes them visually extraordinary. In the last three years I have focused my attention on the Alexander Calder sculpture, <em>Two Disks</em>, which sits in front of the Hirshhorn Museum on the National Mall in Washington, DC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This new adventure of my artistic life has brought me to a fantastic opportunity to have five separate exhibitions during 2013 and into 2014. However, this great opportunity requires a great financial investment. Exhibits come with heavy costs: printing, matting, framing, promotions, postcards, invitations, catering, and transportation…they all add up to an expensive enterprise. This is why I need your help and all supporters will receive a signed, matted photograph from the collection as well as a commemorative poster as a thank you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Alexander Calder sculpture, <em>Two Disks</em>, in addition to its obvious grace and beauty, has a resonant and compelling movement and a sensual dynamism that captivated my photographic eye. Each session I spent with the sculpture was spiritually moving to me as an artist.</p>
<p>I always sought to maintain the integrity of Calder’s single intention, which I perceived to be the inherent appearance of motion in the “disks” with their curvature, providing the viewer a beginning point and an end point. I began a serious interpretation of the sculpture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were additional elements to interplay with the “disks”: There was a crystalline blue sky and the subtle monochromatic façade of the museum that added new dimensions to the sculpture. The sun became prominent and my horizontal and vertical explorations were creating silhouettes that gave new meaning to Calder’s “disks” and indeed the central structure that held the sculpture up to the sun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These initial renderings were only resonant in black and white since there was no color in the structure and against the sun and sky and building façade, there were only gradations of gray; it seemed to coincide with my continuing love affair with black and white photography.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a clear sun intrusion that emerged with my subsequent interpretations of the Calder sculpture. I saw it in different sensual tones and then made a leap into a color toning which translated gray tones into golden, sun-like renderings, I had not anticipated since I rarely make color photographs. I started playing with the sun and the golden influence it had with a newly discovered “pyramidic” intrusion. In many of the photographs, I noticed “pyramids” within images I captured. It had taken on an African-esque interpretation and a universal quality that allowed Calder to transcend what I had discovered weeks and months prior to that day.</p>
<p> I have completed the prototype of my book on the Calder study. There are 60 photographs combined with my writing and the writing of my friend, poet Toni Asante Lightfoot. We crafted a photographic and poetic study of the Calder sculpture, <em>Two Discs</em>, that highlights its special qualities that are so compelling and powerful. The book will be published with these funds and signed early release copies will be given as perks to those who make large donations.</p>
<span>My Calder studies are not a culmination of 40 years of photography; they are yet another <em>period </em>in my career as a photographic artist. I know there’s more ahead and I am excited about the possibilities for the next 40 <br/>years.</span>

<br/>All too often we have seen marginalized 
groups excluded from, and/or exploited by, mainstream artistic and 
cultural endeavors. Therefore, Gallery of the Streets' work is primarily created for, by, 
and with, marginalized communities who have direct and daily experiences
 with racism, sexism, xenophobia, classism and poverty, 
heteronormativity and transphobia. Not only do our voices go unnoticed 
and unsupported, worse yet, our cultural and artistic contributions are 
co-opted and sold back to us. New Orleans-especially post-Katrina NOLA, 
is a prime example of these practices. In this sense, we believe that 
the process of art making as well as the work itself, can evoke 
strategies and actions to transform social ills.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">ECOHYBRIDITY is a collaborative partnership with New Orleans-based artists and organizers. The visual opera marks the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and examines issues connected to disaster capitalism, displacement, spatial inequities, the prison industrial complex, and the privatization of public resources from a Black feminist lens. A large-scale production featuring roving performances and site-specific installations throughout post-Katrina New Orleans, the plot follows a group of nomadic “SONGBIRDS” as they journey to recover, redefine, and reclaim Home.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The visual opera draws on the vision, memory, and skills of New Orleans-based Black feminist artists and organizers—many of whom survived Hurricane Katrina. Through on-going convening, documentation, evaluation, art-making, and collective study, we focus and drive the opera’s content, movements, mapping and impact(s). We are also developing ways to support those who remain displaced and are experiencing trauma ten years later. We aim to fuse 
public art and community engagement to confront power, provoke dialogue,
 and develop a cultural organizing praxis.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As its long-term goal, the project aims to serve as a mechanism to

4. We will be accountable to those whom we engage through direct and/or indirect contact. We walk with rememory.
5. We call for binaries to synthesize.
6. Our work should provide opportunities for viewers and 
makers to dialogue/disagree/ask for-about-/answer

7. The work should find and ride the pocket and be prepared to ride the groove until it is time to fade out ...
8. The nomad's swan song must be on the 1.
9. Be mindful of Kudzu and Passion Flowers. If desired by
 the Community, the Nomad should leave a small part of its mojo behind. 
But not too much...

<p>Hey there, </p>
<p>My name is Reggie and I'm starting up
an indiegogo campaign to help my beautiful girlfriend Jessica McDonald finance her
trip to Toronto so she can attend and sell her incredible work at the One of a
Kind Show at the Direct Energy Centre.  Jessica was nominated and selected
to go to this prestigious event by fellow members of the craft community in St. John's, NL.
  This is such a tremendous honour  and I'm so excited to help make
her dream of going a reality.   With travel costs sky rocketing and a
variety of expenses that come along with such an event, I'm hoping this
indiegogo campaign will inspire people to donate  to help cover some of
her expenses in Toronto.   I am incredibly proud of her for what she has
accomplished so far in her short career and I hope this will be the beginning
of an exciting adventure in the craft world.  </p>
<p>The One of A Kind show is one of the
biggest craft fairs in North America.  To give you an idea what this show
is all about, it entails over 800 artisans and designers  which present
their handcrafted goods to Toronto shoppers.  This show started out as a
humble trade show in the mid-seventies and exploded into one of Toronto’s
largest exhibitions of original arts and crafts. Everything on sale at the One
of a Kind show was made by artisans living in North America.(<a href=""http://www.oneofakindshow.com)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.oneofakindshow.com).</a> The event will take place between the dates of Mar.
25-29th, 2015. </p>
<p>I want to thank you again for taking
the time to read my campaign and I hope this inspires you to donate to help
Jess fulfill her dream of getting to Toronto!  If you feel like donating
5, 10, 20 or even 100 bucks, I would be forever grateful.  I can't think of any perks for
donating but if you donate and want a hug, I will be most willing to give one. Bear hugs are my speciality.  Thanks everyone.  </p>

<p><span>This exhibition series has played a big part in my artistic life in one way or another since I've lived here in Austin and was very anxious to take the reins.

<p><span>I have selected an amazing group of artists to not only show their own work, but to collaborate on new artistic endeavors making their world debut in this exhibition.

<p><span>The idea of “community” has various interpretations. At it’s core, it is about groups of people working together directly or in parallel and under a social contract, be it implicit or not. That idea is the centerpiece of “YLA 18: Con / Juntos,” this year’s iteration of the annual Young Latino Artist (YLA) Series at Mexic-Arte Museum. The title, which means “With / Together,” reinforces the importance of the joining of ideas and of individuals with a common cause, while also referencing the idea of <em>conjuntos</em>, a group of musicians collaborating and unifying their talents to create beautiful music for the public to partake.</span></p>
<p>Even with the YLA series’ inherently constraining eligibility for inclusion (being Latino within a particular age parameter), these limitations create an opportunity to explore and/or create community in different ways. Much like our true cultural reality, this community is comprised of individuals from our various Latino nationalities and cultures, gender identities, and sexual orientations. </p>
<p><span>This exhibition is about nurturing a diverse community of individuals while paying reverence to a shared common space. The selected artists collaborated and opened their homes and studios to each other, sometimes across the globe via the internet, to create many of the works in this exhibition. From many voices, stories and ideas, a community is formed and compose a common song in “Con / Juntos.”</span></p>

<p>WHY SHOULD YOU HELP?  This equipment will enable us to tell the story of quilts with top-quality images and narration to school groups and other visitors, complementing the current exhibition with in-depth information to pique the interest of everyone.  We believe that learning about quilts will encourage a deep sense of appreciation for American material culture and the historic role of women in the past and in the quilt art of today.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOU HELPING US PURCHASE?  If we reach our goal: a professional projector (5000 bright lumens) with built-in audio, and an electric screen, 45 x 80 inches, plus installation.  We need equipment of this quality because the room is rather large and we want to present quilts in the best possible light with true color.</p>

WHY SHOULD YOU HELP?  This equipment will enable us to tell the story of quilts with top-quality images and narration to school groups and other visitors, complementing the current exhibition with in-depth information to pique the interest of everyone.  We believe that learning about quilts will encourage a deep sense of appreciation for American material culture and the historic role of women in the past and in the quilt art of today.
WHAT ARE YOU HELPING US PURCHASE?  If we reach our goal: a professional projector (5000 bright lumens) with built-in audio, and an electric screen, 45 x 80 inches, plus installation.  We need equipment of this quality because the room is rather large and we want to present quilts in the best possible light with true color.

Kijk dan op <a href=""http://mommersontwerp.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mommersontwerp.nl</a><br/></p><h1>Trek de opdrachtgevers aan die bij jou passen</h1>
<h2>Scoren met de juiste vormgeving</h2>
<ul><li>Kom jij ook wel eens op websites terecht
waar je zo gek wordt van de flikkerende kleuren, de grote hoeveelheid
advertenties en de onduidelijke manier waarop je kunt navigeren, dat je meteen
weer wegklikt?</li></ul><p>
</p><p>Techneuten zeggen dat dat aan de slechte techniek ligt. Ik
zeg dat het aan de vormgeving ligt. Websitevormgeving is een combinatie van <b>gebruiksvriendelijkheid</b>, de juiste <b>techniek</b> en een goede combinatie van <b>kleur</b> en <b>typografie</b>. Mis één aspect en je gaat de mist in.</p>
<ul><li>Een van mijn zakelijke relaties is een
fantastische ruimtelijk ontwerper. Zij ontwerpt stijlvolle en toch gedurfde,
moderne badmeubels en -accessoires. Rond de feestdagen kreeg ik echter een
nieuwjaarskaart met flauwe cartoons en slechte typografie. Rationeel weet ik
dat het niets zegt over de ontwerpen die ik al had bewonderd. Toch daalden die
in mijn achting. </li></ul><p>
</p><p>Bij een <b>tegenstrijdigheid
in de vormgeving</b> van de verschillende producten van jou als bedrijf of
ondernemer, raakt je publiek in verwarring over jouw kwaliteiten. </p>
<ul><li>Valt het je wel eens op dat sommige
winkels helemaal vol staan met graaitafels en slordige bordjes, terwijl andere
winkels veel lege ruimte hebben en een opgeruimde aanblik geven? De vormgeving
van de ene soort winkel is niet beter dan die van de andere winkel. Beide
trekken een bepaald soort publiek aan dat bij hen past.</li></ul><p>
</p><p>De <b>juiste </b>vormgeving
zegt niet veel over <b>hoe</b> iets er
precies uitziet, maar alles over de <b>doelgroep</b>.
Als je daar bij jouw vormgeving op let, heb je een goede kans op succes.</p>
<h2>Vormgeving ondersteunt jouw onderneming. Zorg dat je de vormgeving hebt die
bij je past.</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Jij kent jouw onderneming het beste</li>
<li>
Jij kent jouw opdrachtgevers het beste en weet wat zij van je verwachten </li>
<li>
Jouw onderneming verdient de beste vormgeving</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>Of je die vormgeving nu zelf ter hand neemt of uitbesteedt
aan een grafisch ontwerper, in beide gevallen heb je <b>kennis van de basisbegrippen</b> nodig. Mijn doel is het <b>om jou daarin wegwijs te maken</b> en jou
zo <b>zichtbaar beter te laten presteren</b>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1143509/files/20150111113440-IconMOM.jpg?1421004880"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Vormgeving telt</h2>
<p>Over smaak valt te twisten. Dat is ook heel leuk om te doen. Maar <b>goed en functioneel vormgeven</b> is een vak. Je kunt je voordeel er mee doen als je daar meer van weet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Wat is de betekenis en het belang van kleur? Of van letters? </li>
<li>
Hoe zit het met de spaties tussen letters en woorden? </li>
<li>
Wat zijn de beste regelafstanden? </li>
<li>
Hoe verdeel je tekst en foto’s op een webpagina? </li>
<li>
Werk je met een sjabloon of ga je voor maatwerk? </li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>Smaken verschillen en daar valt over te twisten, maar over
<b>rendement</b> denken we allemaal hetzelfde. In een onderzoeksrapport uit 2010 van de Erasmusuniversiteit en TU Delft staat: “<i>De financiële prestatie van een nieuw product is bijna 20% beter als er
bij de ontwikkelingsfase veel aandacht wordt besteed aan design</i>”.</p>
<h2>Wil jij beter presteren?</h2>
<p>Ik wil je helpen om terug te gaan naar de basis. Vormgeving
is een proces dat zich in je hoofd afspeelt en niet op het toetsenbord. Hoe
geef je wat in jouw hoofd zit zo vorm dat jouw opdrachtgevers begrijpen wat jij
bedoelt en dat ze tegelijkertijd jouw <b>professionaliteit
</b>ervaren, zowel online als offline? Wordt 2015 zo jouw beste jaar ooit?</p>
<p><b>Profiteer van mijn 30 jaar ervaring </b></p>
<p>In juli 2015 bestaat mijn bedrijf Mommersontwerp 30 jaar. De
techniek van mijn vak is in die tijd volledig veranderd, van analoog - met
potlood, pen en papier - naar digitaal - met computers. Was de tijd van
potlood, pen en papier nog overzichtelijk, in de digitale wereld speelt vormgeving
de hoofdrol en verandert de techniek doorlopend. Voor gebruikers van computerprogramma’s
– en wie is dat tegenwoordig niet? - kan dit behoorlijk verwarrend zijn. </p>

Scoren met de juiste vormgeving
Kom jij ook wel eens op websites terecht
waar je zo gek wordt van de flikkerende kleuren, de grote hoeveelheid
advertenties en de onduidelijke manier waarop je kunt navigeren, dat je meteen
weer wegklikt?
Techneuten zeggen dat dat aan de slechte techniek ligt. Ik
zeg dat het aan de vormgeving ligt. Websitevormgeving is een combinatie van gebruiksvriendelijkheid, de juiste techniek en een goede combinatie van kleur en typografie. Mis één aspect en je gaat de mist in.
Een van mijn zakelijke relaties is een
fantastische ruimtelijk ontwerper. Zij ontwerpt stijlvolle en toch gedurfde,
moderne badmeubels en -accessoires. Rond de feestdagen kreeg ik echter een
nieuwjaarskaart met flauwe cartoons en slechte typografie. Rationeel weet ik
dat het niets zegt over de ontwerpen die ik al had bewonderd. Toch daalden die
in mijn achting. 
Bij een tegenstrijdigheid
in de vormgeving van de verschillende producten van jou als bedrijf of
ondernemer, raakt je publiek in verwarring over jouw kwaliteiten. 
Valt het je wel eens op dat sommige
winkels helemaal vol staan met graaitafels en slordige bordjes, terwijl andere
winkels veel lege ruimte hebben en een opgeruimde aanblik geven? De vormgeving
van de ene soort winkel is niet beter dan die van de andere winkel. Beide
trekken een bepaald soort publiek aan dat bij hen past.
De juiste vormgeving
zegt niet veel over hoe iets er
precies uitziet, maar alles over de doelgroep.
Als je daar bij jouw vormgeving op let, heb je een goede kans op succes.
Vormgeving ondersteunt jouw onderneming. Zorg dat je de vormgeving hebt die
bij je past.


Jij kent jouw onderneming het beste

Jij kent jouw opdrachtgevers het beste en weet wat zij van je verwachten 

Jouw onderneming verdient de beste vormgeving

Of je die vormgeving nu zelf ter hand neemt of uitbesteedt
aan een grafisch ontwerper, in beide gevallen heb je kennis van de basisbegrippen nodig. Mijn doel is het om jou daarin wegwijs te maken en jou
zo zichtbaar beter te laten presteren.
Vormgeving telt
Over smaak valt te twisten. Dat is ook heel leuk om te doen. Maar goed en functioneel vormgeven is een vak. Je kunt je voordeel er mee doen als je daar meer van weet.


Wat is de betekenis en het belang van kleur? Of van letters? 

Hoe zit het met de spaties tussen letters en woorden? 

Wat zijn de beste regelafstanden? 

Hoe verdeel je tekst en foto’s op een webpagina? 

Werk je met een sjabloon of ga je voor maatwerk? 

Smaken verschillen en daar valt over te twisten, maar over
rendement denken we allemaal hetzelfde. In een onderzoeksrapport uit 2010 van de Erasmusuniversiteit en TU Delft staat: “De financiële prestatie van een nieuw product is bijna 20% beter als er
bij de ontwikkelingsfase veel aandacht wordt besteed aan design”.
Wil jij beter presteren?
Ik wil je helpen om terug te gaan naar de basis. Vormgeving
is een proces dat zich in je hoofd afspeelt en niet op het toetsenbord. Hoe
geef je wat in jouw hoofd zit zo vorm dat jouw opdrachtgevers begrijpen wat jij
bedoelt en dat ze tegelijkertijd jouw professionaliteit
ervaren, zowel online als offline? Wordt 2015 zo jouw beste jaar ooit?
Profiteer van mijn 30 jaar ervaring 
In juli 2015 bestaat mijn bedrijf Mommersontwerp 30 jaar. De
techniek van mijn vak is in die tijd volledig veranderd, van analoog - met
potlood, pen en papier - naar digitaal - met computers. Was de tijd van
potlood, pen en papier nog overzichtelijk, in de digitale wereld speelt vormgeving
de hoofdrol en verandert de techniek doorlopend. Voor gebruikers van computerprogramma’s
– en wie is dat tegenwoordig niet? - kan dit behoorlijk verwarrend zijn. 
Met kennis meer invloed
Om mijn kennis en
ervaring over digitale (en analoge) vormgeving op jou als ondernemer over te brengen, heb ik de afgelopen jaren een aantal boeken geschreven. 


Waar komen ideeën vandaan voor een goede vormgeving?

Wat is een goede vormgeving? Een vormgeving die resultaten boekt! Ja, maar
hoe?

Krijg je de vormgeving die je verdient? Investeren en vormgeven.

Hoe zet je jouw technische middelen in voor een goed vormgevingsresultaat?

Hoe krijg je goede vormgeving? Met een praktisch plan.

Daarnaast vind je tips op mijn blog. In 2015 ga ik hier mee
door, ook door webinars  en korte (instructie-)videos
aan te bieden.

And so that I could remind others of the power that lies in this simple concept that we so often overlook.” – Walter Böhmer, Creative Lead</i></p><p>Many of our crew were part of the temple crews for previous AfrikaBurns including Metamorphosis (the butterfly), Awakening (the lotus) and the Grateful Heart. There are also some newcomers whose fiery optimism and enthusiasm suggests that they’ve always been Burners. We are all passionate about the Burn and have volunteered hundreds of hours already to make this project happen.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Workshop space</strong></li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Due to unforeseen circumstances, we lost our workshop space just before we were scheduled to start building, a hiccup that had both practical and financial implications. However, in true Burner spirit, we made a plan, and we’re now building at two crew members’ homes as well as a warehouse. Johannesburg is a sprawling city and moving between our build locations takes some commitment. Fortunately, we’ve got plenty of that, we are well on track with our build schedule and are having heaps of fun in the process.</p><ul><li><strong>Safety</strong></li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As the description suggests, the structure is complex, and since it involves two floors, safety is our primary concern. We have engaged with a structural engineer who has provided us with formal sign-off on structural safety and with whom we have discussed the temple’s design and build, taking into account the often difficult building conditions in the Karoo.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Other ways you can help</strong></h3><p>We understand that you might not be able to contribute financially, but we’d still appreciate you helping us in any other way you can.

There are also some newcomers whose fiery optimism and enthusiasm suggests that they’ve always been Burners. We are all passionate about the Burn and have volunteered hundreds of hours already to make this project happen. Risks & ChallengesWorkshop spaceDue to unforeseen circumstances, we lost our workshop space just before we were scheduled to start building, a hiccup that had both practical and financial implications. However, in true Burner spirit, we made a plan, and we’re now building at two crew members’ homes as well as a warehouse. Johannesburg is a sprawling city and moving between our build locations takes some commitment. Fortunately, we’ve got plenty of that, we are well on track with our build schedule and are having heaps of fun in the process.SafetyAs the description suggests, the structure is complex, and since it involves two floors, safety is our primary concern. We have engaged with a structural engineer who has provided us with formal sign-off on structural safety and with whom we have discussed the temple’s design and build, taking into account the often difficult building conditions in the Karoo. Other ways you can helpWe understand that you might not be able to contribute financially, but we’d still appreciate you helping us in any other way you can.

<p><strong>What is Palenque Norte? </strong></p>
<p>“It’s like TED talks for Psychedelics” </p>
<p>The Palenque Norte Speaker Series is a series of lectures focused on altered states of consciousness, psychedelic medicines, and the mystical experience. We will be returning to the Burning Man festival for the first time since 2007, and need your help to make this happen. We’ve put together an amazing schedule of 22 speakers across 4 days. The talks will hosted by Camp Above the Limit and be located in the Crystal Cavern, a 40’ dome at 9:15 &amp; B. </p>
<p>Check out the full schedule and audio from past lectures at: <a href=""http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/</a></p>
<p><strong>Why is this great for the world? </strong></p>
<p>At the core, we’re about spreading information. There is so much mis-information in the world surrounding the use of Psychedelics, and we’re here to tell a different story. With your help we will produce what will be the best Psychedelic lecture series Burning Man has ever seen, and we will prepare recordings and videos to be distributed via the Psychedelic Salon podcast and the web to share the lectures. Tens of thousands of people will have access to these talks and videos over the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need money?</strong></p>
<p>We need your help this year to bring Palenque Norte back to the playa. Your support will be used to purchase A/V equipment such as a PA system, a projector, a screen, and microphones. We also need funds for brochures, signage, posters, and décor, and any additional funding will be contributed to the Psychedelic Salon to help produce the podcasts.</p>
<p>After the event, not only will the A/V gear be used for future burns, it will be available for use in the community and partner organizations such as the Psychedelic Society of San Francisco. In this way we can continue to hold space for public discussion on psychedleics. </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal, we’ll use what we have and what you’ve given us to pull things together. The show must go on!</p>
<p><strong>What’s in it for you? </strong></p>
<p>Besides helping a great cause to spread information about altered states of consciousness and psychedelic medicines around the globe, you’ll get some perks:</p>
<p>To start we’ll send you a personal thank you, commemorative postcard and a limited brochure. From there, donation levels go up to provide additonal collectibles such as DVDs of the lectures, signed copies of “The Terence McKenna Experience” movie, signed copies of Lorenzo Haggerty's ""The Spirit of the Internet and invites to a private party in San Francisco. </p>
<p><strong>Why should you trust us?</strong></p>
<p>The organizer of this year’s speaker series, Chris Pezza, successfully organized a similar lecture series at Burning Man 2011, called the Saraswati Speaker Series. Over 5 days the Saraswati Speaker Series brought together over twenty thought-leaders in the realms of digital rights &amp; privacy and psychedelic research, drawing more than thousand attendees throughout the week.  The Saraswati Speaker Series was also featured on ReadWriteWeb: <a href=""http://rww.to/vJHpm6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://rww.to/vJHpm6</a></p>
<p>Chris is being supported by previous Palenque Norte organizers Lorenzo Hagerty and Bruce Damer. Their leadership is responsible for all the amazing Palenque Norte lectures that were produced on the playa between the years of 2002-2007. Lorenzo has worked for years to produce over 300 hours of psychedelic lectures, many of which by Terence Mckenna, which you can listen to at <a href=""http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/</a></p>
<p>Daniel Jabbour, the founder of the Psychedelic Society of San Franscisco, is helping to MC and run AV at this year's Palenque Norte series. Daniel's leadership has help grow the Psychedelic Society of SF to over 1500 members in less than six months.

<p>The Palenque Norte journey began with the legendary Entheobotany Conferences held at the Chan Kah hotel near the ancient Mayan ruins just outside of Palenque, Mexico. There, Terence McKenna, Jonathan Ott, Ann &amp; Sasha Shulgin, and a host of other psychedelic luminaries passed along many insights, discoveries, and wild tales to the fortunate Tribe members who were there. And it was at the end of the pool where Terence McKenna gave some of his last talks at the Chan Kah.<br/><br/> Years later, then in 2003, a few alumni from those conferences decided to have a ""Palenque reunion"" at the Burning Man Festival, and so we organized a theme camp and lecture series to continue the Palenque tradition. </p>

<p>Please visit us on the playa this year at the Crystal Cavern, located at 9:15 and B. We can’t wait to see you in the dust!</p></div>","Featuring lectures by lumanaries such as Alex and Allyson Grey, Paul Stamets, Rick Doblin, Daniel Pinchbeck, and more! 
What is Palenque Norte? 
“It’s like TED talks for Psychedelics” 
The Palenque Norte Speaker Series is a series of lectures focused on altered states of consciousness, psychedelic medicines, and the mystical experience. We will be returning to the Burning Man festival for the first time since 2007, and need your help to make this happen. We’ve put together an amazing schedule of 22 speakers across 4 days. The talks will hosted by Camp Above the Limit and be located in the Crystal Cavern, a 40’ dome at 9:15 & B. 
Check out the full schedule and audio from past lectures at: http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/
Why is this great for the world? 
At the core, we’re about spreading information. There is so much mis-information in the world surrounding the use of Psychedelics, and we’re here to tell a different story. With your help we will produce what will be the best Psychedelic lecture series Burning Man has ever seen, and we will prepare recordings and videos to be distributed via the Psychedelic Salon podcast and the web to share the lectures. Tens of thousands of people will have access to these talks and videos over the years to come.
Why do we need money?
We need your help this year to bring Palenque Norte back to the playa. Your support will be used to purchase A/V equipment such as a PA system, a projector, a screen, and microphones. We also need funds for brochures, signage, posters, and décor, and any additional funding will be contributed to the Psychedelic Salon to help produce the podcasts.
After the event, not only will the A/V gear be used for future burns, it will be available for use in the community and partner organizations such as the Psychedelic Society of San Francisco. In this way we can continue to hold space for public discussion on psychedleics. 
If we don’t reach our goal, we’ll use what we have and what you’ve given us to pull things together. The show must go on!
What’s in it for you? 
Besides helping a great cause to spread information about altered states of consciousness and psychedelic medicines around the globe, you’ll get some perks:
To start we’ll send you a personal thank you, commemorative postcard and a limited brochure. From there, donation levels go up to provide additonal collectibles such as DVDs of the lectures, signed copies of “The Terence McKenna Experience” movie, signed copies of Lorenzo Haggerty's ""The Spirit of the Internet and invites to a private party in San Francisco. 
Why should you trust us?
The organizer of this year’s speaker series, Chris Pezza, successfully organized a similar lecture series at Burning Man 2011, called the Saraswati Speaker Series. Over 5 days the Saraswati Speaker Series brought together over twenty thought-leaders in the realms of digital rights & privacy and psychedelic research, drawing more than thousand attendees throughout the week.  The Saraswati Speaker Series was also featured on ReadWriteWeb: http://rww.to/vJHpm6
Chris is being supported by previous Palenque Norte organizers Lorenzo Hagerty and Bruce Damer. Their leadership is responsible for all the amazing Palenque Norte lectures that were produced on the playa between the years of 2002-2007. Lorenzo has worked for years to produce over 300 hours of psychedelic lectures, many of which by Terence Mckenna, which you can listen to at http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/
Daniel Jabbour, the founder of the Psychedelic Society of San Franscisco, is helping to MC and run AV at this year's Palenque Norte series. Daniel's leadership has help grow the Psychedelic Society of SF to over 1500 members in less than six months. Find out more about the Psychedelic Society at http://www.psychedelicsf.org/

<p align=""center""><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>Laundromat is about this man in search of his identity and the truth in his past. He seems to carry a load of unconscious guilt because in the dream, he sees himself buried in the sand by the kid. As we come to the end of the film, we come to realize where the guilt stems from. He probably hasn’t been the perfect dad or husband to the family he now remembers he had. Mike also seems to have a tendency to keep him from remembering the family. Perhaps he’s just trying to protect his brother or maybe he himself has something to do with that family.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>ABOUT MARJAN HASHEMI</strong></p>
<p>Marjan Hashemi was born and raised in Iran. She graduated in literature and then received her master’s degree in psychology. She then went on to study acting and played roles in Tv series and short films. In 2017, she received an award for directing a play at Hilaj Festival.She made her first film in 2017 and the film was nominated for best short film at WOW festival in Dubai. The Drip(2018) was her second film and had screenings in Iranian and international festivals including Kerala Film Festival. She made her third short film in 2019 and it competed in various festivals around the world including Paris, Germany, Canada and the US. She’s currently a student in advanced TV and film at Sheridan college mastering in writing and directing.</p>
<p>The Laundromat is her new project; a story about a man who has lost his memory in an accident and is struggling to connect to his past. little does he know that hurtful truths are awaiting him on this journey. Identity crisis is one of the most challenging issues in our modern world. How many times have we asked this question of ourselves: Who am I? This film deals with that question. The character experiences painful moments trying to find out who he really is and it’s very relatable because all of us go through these chaotic periods in our life trying to make sense of it all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>MY STORY</strong></p>
<p>Being an immigrant, I have personally dealt with identity issues and I understand how hard it can become at times when one’s in the dark about aspects of oneself and the past.</p>
<p>I believe this film has a story to tell all of us. It encourages us to take the courage to explore within ourselves and not to be afraid to tread into the unknown part of us to realize who we really are.  </p>

<h3>WHO IS WUSSY</h3>
<p>WUSSY is an independent, Queer media company founded in 2015 out of Atlanta, GA. We created WUSSY because we wanted the autonomy to tell our own stories. Our Queer community is vast, colorful, vibrant, and a hell of a lot more fun than the traditional capital G gay mainstream media portrays us. </p>

<h3>
<br/>What We DO</h3>
<p>The core of our mission is to create spaces for Queer artists. We do that through -- </p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing a Bi-Annual print magazine, featuring a vast array of international Queer artists, movers, and shakers. We've self-published and self-distributed eight volumes so far.</li>
<li>Curating monthly events -- drag shows, film screenings, art exhibitions, comedy events, poetry readings, open mics and more!</li>
<li> The WUSSY Podcast Network -- launched in the summer of 2020, we publish three weekly shows (Good Judy, WUSSY Movie Club, and Secure the Gag) </li>
<li>Fostering community via social media -- we have garnered an active following on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter who look to us for updated news on Queer Art &amp; Culture </li>

<h3>
<br/>The Pandemic</h3>
<p>When the lockdown started in March 2020, WUSSY had a whole years worth of fundraising events lined up from April - December. Without the fundraising from those events, we were unable to publish our planned Fall/Winter 2020 issue. </p>
<p>We went full speed ahead into creating new avenues for our regular performers and contributors to make money and stay active. With the help of Southern Fried, Queer Pride, we raised nearly $20,000 in the form of micro-grants for Southern &amp; Appalachian Queer artists and their projects.</p>
<p>Despite other promoters and clubs in Atlanta and across the country acting recklessly and still holding indoor events, we held firm and did what we could to create safer, outdoor events like the Drive-In Drag Shows and the O4W Artist Market. </p>
<p>During the winter time, we've had to put those events on pause.</p>

SUMMARY: My name is Jessica Chappe and I am a Photography Major at Bard College. This indiegogo will help me fulfill my senior thesis exhibition. My Senior Thesis Project is called Personal Utopias: passion projects that are creating a growing vision through collaboration.



KINGSTON MODEL TRAIN CLUB (photo credit Jessica Chappe)
I was raised in two communities that I consider my utopias. They have made me who I am today. They give me peace of mind and allow me to feel at home. Home, in the sense of physically feeling
safe, comfortable, and alive—letting go of a façade and truly being authentic. Once I have graduated I would love to
find my own passion project where I feel like I am making a difference; maybe
not in the grand scale of things but through human connection and creativity.
This is why I am on the look out for these personal utopias; because I want to
learn what it takes to create a piece of my heart. This project is meant to celebrate what people can make through alternative visions. 
This project is aimed to find a spectrum of utopian environments and communities. So far I have photographed the:

Cassiopeia is a project that aims to explore and foreground the importance of research and pursuing your interests, not just for artists but for everyone. As a group of collaborators our interests are in systems of knowledge, particularly those relating to communication and architectural structures.</span><br/></p><p></p>

<p>Anne, Hannah and Catrin met whilst studying at the Royal College
of Art where they discovered shared interests in architecture and cryptography.
Anne and Hannah worked on a collaborative project in Berefet and Njawara,
Gambia, where knowledge about traditional music and culture was shared and
Hannah worked with some of the Gambian collaborators to make crystal radios,
allowing them important access to national media. In 2013, Hannah and Catrin
exhibited work looking at radio and code breaking at Bletchley Park. Amy and Irene
met on an MA at Falmouth University where Catrin now teaches. They realised
that they had a shared interest in cryptography when, after visiting one of
Catrin’s shows, Amy and Irene began to email her in Morse Code. </p>
<p>We’ve been discussing work and research as a group since 2015 and had
our first show together in February 2016. </p>

<p>Cassiopeia is a project that will continue throughout 2016. In November we will have an exhibition at Guest Projects in Hackney and we are planning to document the year in a publication. Each part of the project is a development of and a response to the last one. We are applying for a grant from the Arts Council to help us fund our Guest Projects show and the publication. In February 2017 we hope to return to Primary to complete the project with a final exhibition.<br/></p><p><b>Irene Vidal's</b> practice
communicates a particular view about popular culture, historic resonances and
the poetics of politics. She works with revisions and appropriation of history
in order to merge factual occurrences and fiction within her practice. Her work
is currently examining the popular archive within the context of the Franco
dictatorship in Spain. She has participated in programs such as
Apprentice/Master Exhibitions at Kunstpodium T (Tilburg, The Netherlands) and
is currently undertaking a collaborative residency at the Porthcurno Telegraph
Museum as an artist and researcher in their archive. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457793490/kb6eruwop6hspobc5gzy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Decade Volcanoes, Irene Vidal Cal, 2014

the heritage and stories of the traveling fairground. She enjoys uncovering
myths and dubious narratives, which are then documented through narrative
layers in her sign-painting. In Autumn 2016 Amy will begin a
practice-based PhD undertaking the construction of ‘an archive of illustrated
space’: constructing more fixed and definite identities for the
fairground-women. She has worked with Giffords Circus and Carters Steam Fair and runs ongoing workshops with archives and primary schools in Cornwall. She is currently undertaking a collaborative residency at the
Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, responding to their archive material through
research and practice. </span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457798085/ip0mqiyzvbt3uilfcwwe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Installation shot of Amy's work at Cassiopeia:Hand at Primary studios in Nottingham, February 2016</p>
<p>Primarily drawing based, <b>Hannah Rae Alton’s</b> work also involves
small-scale sculpture and film. Her main area of interest is the process of
communication: how it is successful, when it breaks down. This focus has led
her to make work about the physical function of radio, historical documents
(Horror: Lightning In Serene Sky, 2011-12, commissioned by the Armitt Museum)
and cryptography at Bletchley Park, (The Wondrous Tale of Alice and Bob, 2012,
ArtHertz). Her research and drawing project, Dennis Wilson: Passage (2014)
investigates the dissemination of historical information online and the
internet archive in a loosely narrative format. Hannah has run workshops for
Frieze, the Roald Dahl Museum, New Vic 6th form college, and MA Authorial
Illustration at Falmouth University, as well as teaching regular life drawing
classes in London. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457797887/uii89p6a2d7wsnic7wzt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Phoneme Drawings, Hannah Rae Alton, 2015<br/></p>
<p><b>Anne
Harild</b> makes work that is
based on research and investigations of the built environment, the systems and
structures that support, shape and guide our daily lives. Anne works in a
variety of medium e.g. collage, sculpture and stop-frame animation. Most
recently Anne was ARMA artist in residence at The Bluecoat, Liverpool. She
has exhibited in group shows in the UK and abroad among others as part of
Atelier a Habiter at z.33 (Belgium), Paradigm Store at 5 Howick place (London)
and Shadow Lines at Tintype gallery (London) as well as creating site specific
images for Art on the Underground which are on display in various tube stations
in London. Furthermore Anne has facilitated workshops and worked on
collaborative projects with schools and community groups for among others Tate
Britain, Camden Arts Centre and The Frieze Art Fair.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457798013/h9i3edhr6iziunagutd7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Folds, Anne Harild, 2011<p></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></b><b>Catrin Morgan’s </b>practice explores the relationship between text and image with a particular interest in creating work governed by underlying frameworks, rules and hidden meanings.

As a set of collaborators we not only share research interests but also particular research methodologies and the APT show will offer us our biggest opportunity to develop new ways of communicating these to the public through designing display systems, workshops and performances which will take place in the space. We did a test run of the project in February and the response was overwhelmingly positive: comments on the show suggested that showing our research alongside our practice offered visitors an unusual insight into the work – one which they really appreciated.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457799759/r8r9znvxlfolzbfnhluq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A crystal radio made during one of the workshops at Primary, February 2016</span><br/></p>
<p>Being interested in what’s around you and looking further is something
that can be valuable to everyone especially if you then go on to respond
creatively to your findings. Our work explores the joy of uncovering something secret or the pleasure
that can be found when you pay attention to things (such as scaffolding) that
might appear banal or everyday. Research into cryptography highlights the
strangeness and beauty of written language and studying buildings allows us to
consider them as structures for organising people and information.</p>
<p></p><p>Support from you will help us to develop Cassiopeia into a beautiful and
unique exhibition. We plan to build contemplative spaces or ‘studies’ within
the gallery space at APT based on paintings of St Jerome in his study. These
will offer us new ways of showing our work and articulating crossovers in our
practice. Visitors to our February show commented that, ""it’s wonderful to
see research with the art, it gives a way into the work"". Another
visitor said that the show gave her, ""access to information I've never
seen before, I didn't even know of the existence of this research content. I
would like to follow the progress of the research in further exhibitions"". <br/></p><div>

<p>We made a test run for this exhibition and the workshops we plan to
offer at Primary studios in February 2016. This gave us the opportunity to make
detailed plans for the APT show and to anticipate any of the risks and
challenges we may face in May. We’ve made slightly different plans for the APT
show based on the different amounts of money that we are able to raise and as
mentioned before, the more money we are able to raise the more ambitious we can
make both the exhibition and the workshops we offer. We have the support of
friends and family along with the guidance of Giovanna at dalla Rosa gallery who
will help us to publicise and curate the show and Valerio at studio Julia who is advising
us on exhibition design. We are working hard to make Cassiopeia as good as it
can be.</p>
<p></p>
</div></div>","We are Hannah Rae Alton (London), Catrin Morgan (Nottingham), Amy Goodwin (Cornwall) Irene Vidal Cal (Galicia, Spain), and Anne Harild (Copenhagen).  We named our project Cassiopeia after a constellation in the Northern hemisphere composed of five stars. Cassiopeia is a project that aims to explore and foreground the importance of research and pursuing your interests, not just for artists but for everyone. As a group of collaborators our interests are in systems of knowledge, particularly those relating to communication and architectural structures.
Installation shot of Cassiopeia: Hand at Primary Studios, February 2016
Anne, Hannah and Catrin met whilst studying at the Royal College
of Art where they discovered shared interests in architecture and cryptography.
Anne and Hannah worked on a collaborative project in Berefet and Njawara,
Gambia, where knowledge about traditional music and culture was shared and
Hannah worked with some of the Gambian collaborators to make crystal radios,
allowing them important access to national media. In 2013, Hannah and Catrin
exhibited work looking at radio and code breaking at Bletchley Park. Amy and Irene
met on an MA at Falmouth University where Catrin now teaches. They realised
that they had a shared interest in cryptography when, after visiting one of
Catrin’s shows, Amy and Irene began to email her in Morse Code. 
We’ve been discussing work and research as a group since 2015 and had
our first show together in February 2016. 
Irene and Catrin discussing work at Primary (Nottingham).
Cassiopeia is a project that will continue throughout 2016. In November we will have an exhibition at Guest Projects in Hackney and we are planning to document the year in a publication. Each part of the project is a development of and a response to the last one. We are applying for a grant from the Arts Council to help us fund our Guest Projects show and the publication. In February 2017 we hope to return to Primary to complete the project with a final exhibition.Irene Vidal's practice
communicates a particular view about popular culture, historic resonances and
the poetics of politics. She works with revisions and appropriation of history
in order to merge factual occurrences and fiction within her practice. Her work
is currently examining the popular archive within the context of the Franco
dictatorship in Spain. She has participated in programs such as
Apprentice/Master Exhibitions at Kunstpodium T (Tilburg, The Netherlands) and
is currently undertaking a collaborative residency at the Porthcurno Telegraph
Museum as an artist and researcher in their archive. Decade Volcanoes, Irene Vidal Cal, 2014
Amy Goodwin’s practice uses the traditional craft of sign painting to explore
the heritage and stories of the traveling fairground. She enjoys uncovering
myths and dubious narratives, which are then documented through narrative
layers in her sign-painting. In Autumn 2016 Amy will begin a
practice-based PhD undertaking the construction of ‘an archive of illustrated
space’: constructing more fixed and definite identities for the
fairground-women. She has worked with Giffords Circus and Carters Steam Fair and runs ongoing workshops with archives and primary schools in Cornwall. She is currently undertaking a collaborative residency at the
Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, responding to their archive material through
research and practice. Installation shot of Amy's work at Cassiopeia:Hand at Primary studios in Nottingham, February 2016
Primarily drawing based, Hannah Rae Alton’s work also involves
small-scale sculpture and film. Her main area of interest is the process of
communication: how it is successful, when it breaks down. This focus has led
her to make work about the physical function of radio, historical documents
(Horror: Lightning In Serene Sky, 2011-12, commissioned by the Armitt Museum)
and cryptography at Bletchley Park, (The Wondrous Tale of Alice and Bob, 2012,
ArtHertz). Her research and drawing project, Dennis Wilson: Passage (2014)
investigates the dissemination of historical information online and the
internet archive in a loosely narrative format. Hannah has run workshops for
Frieze, the Roald Dahl Museum, New Vic 6th form college, and MA Authorial
Illustration at Falmouth University, as well as teaching regular life drawing
classes in London. Phoneme Drawings, Hannah Rae Alton, 2015
Anne
Harild makes work that is
based on research and investigations of the built environment, the systems and
structures that support, shape and guide our daily lives. Anne works in a
variety of medium e.g. collage, sculpture and stop-frame animation. Most
recently Anne was ARMA artist in residence at The Bluecoat, Liverpool. She
has exhibited in group shows in the UK and abroad among others as part of
Atelier a Habiter at z.33 (Belgium), Paradigm Store at 5 Howick place (London)
and Shadow Lines at Tintype gallery (London) as well as creating site specific
images for Art on the Underground which are on display in various tube stations
in London. Furthermore Anne has facilitated workshops and worked on
collaborative projects with schools and community groups for among others Tate
Britain, Camden Arts Centre and The Frieze Art Fair.Folds, Anne Harild, 2011Catrin Morgan’s practice explores the relationship between text and image with a particular interest in creating work governed by underlying frameworks, rules and hidden meanings. Most of her projects are conceived in relation with the book format, from limited edition artist books to mainstream publishing. Her research on theTaxonomy of Deception developed into a PhD at the Royal College of Art, a project closely connected with her illustrations for Ben Marcus' novel The Age of Wire and String, commissioned and published by Granta Books (2013). Catrin teaches at Norwich University of the Arts and Falmouth University and has facilitated workshops for the Royal College of Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum.Studies for Studies #1, Catrin Morgan, 2016The Cassiopeia: Hip show at APT Gallery in Deptford in May will be the second part of the Cassiopeia project. As a set of collaborators we not only share research interests but also particular research methodologies and the APT show will offer us our biggest opportunity to develop new ways of communicating these to the public through designing display systems, workshops and performances which will take place in the space. We did a test run of the project in February and the response was overwhelmingly positive: comments on the show suggested that showing our research alongside our practice offered visitors an unusual insight into the work – one which they really appreciated.A crystal radio made during one of the workshops at Primary, February 2016
Being interested in what’s around you and looking further is something
that can be valuable to everyone especially if you then go on to respond
creatively to your findings. Our work explores the joy of uncovering something secret or the pleasure
that can be found when you pay attention to things (such as scaffolding) that
might appear banal or everyday. Research into cryptography highlights the
strangeness and beauty of written language and studying buildings allows us to
consider them as structures for organising people and information.
Support from you will help us to develop Cassiopeia into a beautiful and
unique exhibition. We plan to build contemplative spaces or ‘studies’ within
the gallery space at APT based on paintings of St Jerome in his study. These
will offer us new ways of showing our work and articulating crossovers in our
practice. Visitors to our February show commented that, ""it’s wonderful to
see research with the art, it gives a way into the work"". Another
visitor said that the show gave her, ""access to information I've never
seen before, I didn't even know of the existence of this research content. I
would like to follow the progress of the research in further exhibitions"". 


Amy at work
The more money we raise the more ambitious we can be in the display systems we build, workshops that we are able to offer and participants we can involve. For example, we would like to give local school children the opportunity of building crystal radios but will need to be able to supply specialist materials in order to make this happen.
We are looking to raise £3500 to cover costs of building display systems
for the exhibition, a website, publicity, materials for producing the work and
purchasing workshop materials. Any extra money we earn will be used to offer
further workshops and to fund opportunities for post grad and under grad
students to also offer workshops from within the APT gallery during the show.

The works featured all engage with themes of sex work positivity from a variety of angles. We believe it is imperative to create an intersectional dialogue including the voices of queer sex workers, trans sex workers, sex workers of colour, and disabled sex workers, and to acknowledge the range of different lived experiences. The works span a variety of media, including video, sculpture, and photography in hopes of creating a more interactive experience for visitors.</p><h3>Artists and Works:</h3><p><strong>Alli Logout - <i>Lucid Noon, Sunset Blush</i></strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoAVCyQJTxs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Lucid Noon, Sunset Blush</i> </a>follows the lives of a group of queer femme sex workers living together in a house in Texas and deals with overlapping themes of race, gender, feminism, sexuality, and sex work to present an honest and hopeful narrative.</p><p><strong>Norene Leddy with Andrew Milmoe, Ed B. LePow, and Melissa Gira Grant- <i>The Aphrodite Project: Platforms</i></strong></p><p><i>The Aphrodite Project: Platforms</i> has been described as a “social sculpture” designed as a conceptual homage to Aphrodite. It consists of platform shoes simultaneously designed as a practical device for sex workers and as a new media artwork to promote a public dialogue. The shoes contain a small screen that plays videos related to Aphrodite and can display advertising for the sex worker wearing them; they also feature an alarm, GPS, and a button to signal the police or sex workers’ rights groups, to promote safety for sex workers. The shoes have previously been shown as sculptural objects and used as part of various performances.</p><p><strong>Vera Rodriguez &amp; Nayra Green - <i>Behind the Window</i></strong></p><p><i>Behind the Window</i> was created through the Sex Work Stories workshops, a series of workshops that teach sex workers skills in a variety of artistic media and display the results. The short film is based on a text written by Nayra Green about the day to day life of a sex worker that follows her thoughts while she is working, presenting a more human side to sex work.</p><h2>Events:</h2><h3>Opening Night</h3><p>The opening night will be held on April 20th.

The works featured all engage with themes of sex work positivity from a variety of angles. We believe it is imperative to create an intersectional dialogue including the voices of queer sex workers, trans sex workers, sex workers of colour, and disabled sex workers, and to acknowledge the range of different lived experiences. The works span a variety of media, including video, sculpture, and photography in hopes of creating a more interactive experience for visitors.Artists and Works:Alli Logout - Lucid Noon, Sunset BlushLucid Noon, Sunset Blush follows the lives of a group of queer femme sex workers living together in a house in Texas and deals with overlapping themes of race, gender, feminism, sexuality, and sex work to present an honest and hopeful narrative.Norene Leddy with Andrew Milmoe, Ed B. LePow, and Melissa Gira Grant- The Aphrodite Project: PlatformsThe Aphrodite Project: Platforms has been described as a “social sculpture” designed as a conceptual homage to Aphrodite. It consists of platform shoes simultaneously designed as a practical device for sex workers and as a new media artwork to promote a public dialogue. The shoes contain a small screen that plays videos related to Aphrodite and can display advertising for the sex worker wearing them; they also feature an alarm, GPS, and a button to signal the police or sex workers’ rights groups, to promote safety for sex workers. The shoes have previously been shown as sculptural objects and used as part of various performances.Vera Rodriguez & Nayra Green - Behind the WindowBehind the Window was created through the Sex Work Stories workshops, a series of workshops that teach sex workers skills in a variety of artistic media and display the results. The short film is based on a text written by Nayra Green about the day to day life of a sex worker that follows her thoughts while she is working, presenting a more human side to sex work.Events:Opening NightThe opening night will be held on April 20th. As well as getting a first look at the exhibition, there will be a performance by Christopher Bond and refreshments with donations going to Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement (SWARM).PerformanceChristopher Bond will be repeating his performance on April 24th at 5pmTalkVera Rodriguez will be doing a talk via skype on Sunday, April 22nd.ScreeningsOn Sunday, April 22nd, the film Sunflowers of Nicaragua  (Girasoles de Nicaragua) by Florence Jarguay will be screened at 3pm What We Need & What You GetWhat we need:Although we have generously been given £1200 of funding by the Goldsmiths Alumni & Friends Fund, we need another £600 of extra funding to cover all of the costs of the exhibition, and ensure that the artists are paid fairly.

<p>I want to say a huge THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH for donating, for supporting me and taking the time to read about my struggles and help me on my journey to fulfill my dreams. This past week I received an email that informed me my trip to New York City is cancelled due to Miki Agrawal, the author of the book Do Cool Shit, having too much going on to give her time to the bootcamp. I am incredibly disappointed and have been trying to figure out the best way to tell all of you. I’m frustrated I was put in this position at all, but I understand the busy lives of entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>That being said- I want to give you all the option of receiving a refund or helping me form a new game plan, a new boot camp if you will. Please, if you need the money back for whatever reason do not hesitate, I will not be offended. After some time grieving this trip being cancelled I decided if the opportunity won’t happen in New York City I will make it happen here in this awesome startup hub St. Louis.</p>
<p>The main goals of my trip to New York City were too:</p>
<p>1. Clarify my brand, nail down exactly what services my business will offer</p>
<p>2. Network with others to form a community of like minded people</p>
<p>3. File for an LLC</p>
<p>4. Develop a professional website</p>
<p>5. Run and grow a business I can take with me as I travel around the world as a pastor’s wife. And a lover of travel in general</p>
<p>How can I do this here in St. Louis?</p>
<p>1. Meet with Brevity, or a similar service, which will help me with digital design and branding to clarify my brand and reach my audience with a clear, concise message. Funds I raised from the Do Cool Shit trip will go towards using this service.</p>
<p>2. I am working with a friend to get a spot at a startup incubator, which means I will use funds raised from this trip to pay rent for my space. I am going to tour TechArtista Saturday to check it out and get the total cost for the year (until I leave with Nathan for vicarage).  Funds from the DCS trip will also go towards this space.</p>
<p>3. With help from the incubator since many of them have an LLC, plus my soon to be brother in law is a lawyer, I hope to successfully file for an LLC within a year.</p>
<p>4. With the help of Brevity or a similar service I will develop a crystal clear, modern website that delivers the message of my brand to my consumer</p>
<p>5. I plan to make my business digital to start, so that I can take it with me as a travel the next few years. Anyone that has a pastor in their family can tell you it’s not an easy life, and women struggle to establish themselves while they constantly move. I want to be someone who can take their business on the go, as well as a resource for women struggling to follow their passions as they are taken from one place to the next.</p>
<p>My online presence will begin as a platform for my creative services, but after I settle into a city I plan to develop a brick and mortar that will look something like this:</p>
<p>If you haven’t, look up an 826 store and imagine the front of the studio made up of tangible art, written word, and design created by struggling artists, closet poets, and defeated 9-5ers sketching intricate designs on their notepads while they wait for the next tedious task. At the back of the studio I want to build a community for people who don’t have people to turn to in order to talk about their creative projects. People who don’t have encouragement and have no clue how to even begin to pursue their dreams. I want to build a place for people to explore creativity, establish deep connections, and overall create a supportive environment that encourages creators on their path to success. We all have it in us, but I know it has taken a community of people to get me to the place where I am now. I want to give that gift to others.</p>
<p>I am working on getting exact prices for TechArtista and Brevity and will shop around other services for the best deal. Any suggestions, or if you want to call me to talk about ideas, whether your own creative endeavors or ideas on how I can build and clarify my brand please email me at <a href=""mailto:susanvbecher@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">susanvbecher@gmail.com</a>, give me a call/text at 314-650-1432, or meet me for lunch/coffee. There’s a cute barista at Kaldi I like to hit on in Clayton so I’m always down to go there and chat!</p>
<p>Again, I will NOT be offended if you decide you want a refund. I am not trying to hold your money captive, I am trying to allocate it in a way that still supports me starting my own business.

Teatr ZAR, phot. Karol Jarek.<br/><br/>
<ul> <li>Awarded performance ""Armine, Sister"" refers to the history of the Armenian people in Anatolia
and their near-extermination at the beginning of the 20th century. The project
enters into the history of Europe’s silence and is a refl­ection on
the act and inheritance of witnessing.
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The project has
been realised in both artistic and research fields, which include expeditions,
studies of Armenian history and music tradition and work sessions led in the
Grotowski Institute in Wroclaw. In the years 2010-2012 the company travelled to
Istanbul and to Anatolian cities, Yerevan, and also Jerusalem, and met with
choir leaders, chorists, and musicians, some of whom take part in the work on
the performance work. Among them is Istanbul-born Aram Kerovpyan, master-singer
of the Armenian Cathedral of Paris, who has become the key collaborator in the
research. The project focuses on the phenomenon of the Armenian monodic singing
tradition and the way it has been preserved or not in diaspora which was
largely formed after the First World War as a result of the Armenian Genocide
in 1915.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Rather than
focusing on the history of the events of 1915 or the history of the ensuing
denial and taboo, Teatr ZAR centres on the history of ignorance that feeds on
inaction and leads to inaction on the part of today’s
Europeans. On the other hand, the history of ignorance also includes the social
story of building an accord of silence around each act of violence. The events
in Anatolia in the early 20th century launch us into a wider debate about
lessons in “witnessing after witnessing”, which always turn into lessons in identity.
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Armine, Sister
not only reveals the history of the Armenian extermination, but also the
history of silence and the responsibility for it. ­The work explores what it
means to be a witness, and what witnessing means to us today. We cannot and do
not want to speak on behalf of Armenians, but we wish our performance to break
the chord of silence.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1324910/files/20150325065812-WITNESSME_installation_in_Kanonhallen__Oslo__4-6_March_2015._Fot._MM.jpg?1427291892"" src="""" style=""""/></p>WITNESSME instalation in  Oslo, 4-6th of March, phot.

</div></div>","Short Summary 

Armine, Sister is
a multipronged project that includes creation of a performance and presenting
it in Poland and abroad, work on publications, among others on a photographic
album, organising photographic exhibitions, panel discussions and concerts of
musicians. The project is the first manifestation of the new domain of the
group’s work –WITNESS/ACTION. ZAR
collaborates with the Gomitas Institute, the Armenian Embassy in Poland and
Armenian associations.

""Armine, Sister"". Teatr ZAR, phot. Karol Jarek.
 Awarded performance ""Armine, Sister"" refers to the history of the Armenian people in Anatolia
and their near-extermination at the beginning of the 20th century. The project
enters into the history of Europe’s silence and is a refl­ection on
the act and inheritance of witnessing.


The project has
been realised in both artistic and research fields, which include expeditions,
studies of Armenian history and music tradition and work sessions led in the
Grotowski Institute in Wroclaw. In the years 2010-2012 the company travelled to
Istanbul and to Anatolian cities, Yerevan, and also Jerusalem, and met with
choir leaders, chorists, and musicians, some of whom take part in the work on
the performance work. Among them is Istanbul-born Aram Kerovpyan, master-singer
of the Armenian Cathedral of Paris, who has become the key collaborator in the
research. The project focuses on the phenomenon of the Armenian monodic singing
tradition and the way it has been preserved or not in diaspora which was
largely formed after the First World War as a result of the Armenian Genocide
in 1915.

Rather than
focusing on the history of the events of 1915 or the history of the ensuing
denial and taboo, Teatr ZAR centres on the history of ignorance that feeds on
inaction and leads to inaction on the part of today’s
Europeans. On the other hand, the history of ignorance also includes the social
story of building an accord of silence around each act of violence. The events
in Anatolia in the early 20th century launch us into a wider debate about
lessons in “witnessing after witnessing”, which always turn into lessons in identity.


Armine, Sister
not only reveals the history of the Armenian extermination, but also the
history of silence and the responsibility for it. ­The work explores what it
means to be a witness, and what witnessing means to us today. We cannot and do
not want to speak on behalf of Armenians, but we wish our performance to break
the chord of silence.WITNESSME instalation in  Oslo, 4-6th of March, phot. Magdalena Mądra.


   
Why you should support us?  
Our goal is to recall memory
 of Armenian Genocide. To do it we have to show as many people as 
possible the story of Armine.  
Art is the best way to keep memory alive. Don't allow to bury this tragedy in sand. We
believe in a deep sense of theatre as a vehicle of memory.
We worked on ""Armine, Sister"" for several years. This spectacle was 
awarded several times, but most importantly it has always awaken emotions.  
The spectacle is ready to go, the actors are wonderful, you just have to see it for yourself.

Article about our director


""Fret
unearthed these collaborators—who come, pointedly, from societies representing
both the aggressors and the victims in the conflict the play depicts—over the
course of recent research expeditions to Istanbul, Yerevan, Jerusalem and
thereabouts, and has melded their spare, haunting, rarely heard monodic singing
techniques with ZAR’s own flawless polyphonic singing""

What We Need?
 
We need money for: 


Presenting the world an issue of neglecting memory of Armenian Genocide.
Visiting with our spectacle additional cities around the world.
Preparing exhibitions, paying actors.



Additionaly we need money for: 

Spreading the word about the project in international media. 
Spreading the word about Armenian Genocide in regular and social media.
Preparing a historical exhibition commemorating Armenian Genocide ( something
like http://www.kennedyandoswald.com/of
course the final look depends on a gathered amount of money) 


After the project will be finalised we will present a detailed calculation of
all expenses in our crowdfunding campaign.  Old pictures and stories, phot. Valeria Cocco.

<p>NightArt combines technology with artwork.  It allows you to be creative without the
mess.  Using the special Neon paint pens,
your child will spend hours creating the perfect picture.  Can you imagine their faces when the light
illuminates their drawings?</p>
<p>Our NightArt screens use the best technology.  We use super bright 5050 LED strips so they
will not need to be replaced for 50,000 hours. 
That might not mean much but that is 7 years of continuous use!  </p>
<p>NightArt also
does not take up much room.  The screens
are the size of an ultra slim LED television. 
Unless your child is using it, it will not take up much room.  </p>
<p>We are proud
of our NightArt screen. It is
attractive, simple, and classic looking.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FXmeCtfLHekw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXmeCtfLHekw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FXmeCtfLHekw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"" width=""580""></iframe></div><span style=""font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 38px;""><br/>Who needs

<h3>What's this?</h3> <p>A fundraiser to give me the ability to make metal art that people have asked me to make.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Who are you?</span></p>
<p>My name is Andres Avelar and I live in Gilbert Arizona. Over at the east valley institute of technology(EVIT), I have been working with a TorchmateX plasma table to make parts and signs for the welding program and for those who get approval from the instructors. Because EVIT is a vocational school that is separated into two sections, AM and PM, I am only working with it for two hours. Two hours is a short amount of time and is devoted to the projects for the program and some art projects for the instructors. Whenever people see the art that I do with the machine they ask if I can make something for them. While I really want to make their art in metal, two hours is not enough time to make projects for both the program and other people. So that's what this is, just an effort to make metal art for people.</p>
</div><div> <h3>What's the money going too?</h3> <p>The total $17000 comes from price quotes from; Torchmate, Hypertherm, and looking around on the internet, rounded.</p>
<p>$12000: Torchmate2x2 growth series </p>
<p>$3000: Hypertherm powermax45</p>
<p>$800: Air Compressor</p>
<p>$1200: subpanel installation, plasma consumables, and sheet metal for your perk</p>
<p>the price is not locked to the category, if I can get the equipment at a lower price the money saved will go to subpanel installation, plasma consumables, and sheet metal.</p>
<p><b>Why do you need a subpanel? </b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Even though it is possible to run this equipment from the standard power box on the side of the house, it is much easier to add more equipment in the future with a subpanel.</span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As much as it takes to fulfill the perks I have </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">promised.</span></p>
<p><b>If more than $17000 is raised does it all go to more sheet metal/consumables?</b></p>
<p>No, there is more equipment and a brief description of what it can add to make more intricate projects. here are the stretch goals.</p>
<p>$17400: Sandblasting, this is a cabinet and a sandblasting gun to add another texture to projects.</p>
<p>$21000: Platemarker, the ability to engrave pictures. while it is possible to get an ""engraved"" image with a plasma torch, this can only be done with thick material and has a high chance of warping the metal. Projects that use the plate marker will be brought down to a maximum of 24""x20"" due to how it is mounted to the track.</p>

the price is not locked to the category, if I can get the equipment at a lower price the money saved will go to subpanel installation, plasma consumables, and sheet metal.
Why do you need a subpanel? 
Even though it is possible to run this equipment from the standard power box on the side of the house, it is much easier to add more equipment in the future with a subpanel.
How much sheet metal are you getting?
As much as it takes to fulfill the perks I have promised.

No, there is more equipment and a brief description of what it can add to make more intricate projects. here are the stretch goals.

 Tube cutter image from Torchmate
How come you are not upgrading the plasma table to the 4x4 or even the 2x4?
    You see the problem is space, I know I have room for the extra equipment listed above, which brings me to the last stretch goal
$80000: I will upgrade the plasma table to a 4x4 and move it all to a separate house I will live in and work to make your art projects.
Any additional money will be used to buy sheet metal, consumables, and pipe.

I will be updating this section with example images when I am able to make them. I will be back working with the table January 5 so keep checking back after then to see what the perks look like. All of these perks are at a discount from what normal price would be.

I have grown exponentially through my time at Moore as both an artist and person, and I have decided for myself that traveling abroad is something that I would strongly like to incorporate into my life and art practice at this time.</p>
<p> That being said, I have applied and been accepted into Arcadia University's Summer in Rome program, which is a 3-credit course aimed at evaluating the historical and contemporary aspects of the Italian culture, and I am excited to learn about local customs regarding language, traditional studio practice, and overall wellness. I believe that going to Rome will present a unique challenge for me to face— how will I fight my own habits in order to embrace new ones? Direct observation and engagement with the Italian way of living will conquer this, because I will center myself in one of the most artistically inclined cities in the world. <br/><br/> With your help, I will literally be able to study the work of the Masters, and hone my artistic capabilities and process. I expect to have a more definitive understanding as to what inspired these astute artists, and I know that this study will lend me a richer understanding of what about Rome shapes the mindset of such talented people. By studying the land and resources, I hope to place myself in their shoes and to absorb their mode of communication and thinking.</p>
<p> Overall, I will embrace a new way of living and I will dedicate myself to a regiment of expanding and examining the diverse and new imagery that Rome offers. My overall goal is to consume as much of what life’s travels might provide for me so that I will become infinitely more aware of myself as a woman, aspiring artist and informed student.</p>

I expect to have a more definitive understanding as to what inspired these astute artists, and I know that this study will lend me a richer understanding of what about Rome shapes the mindset of such talented people. By studying the land and resources, I hope to place myself in their shoes and to absorb their mode of communication and thinking.
 Overall, I will embrace a new way of living and I will dedicate myself to a regiment of expanding and examining the diverse and new imagery that Rome offers. My overall goal is to consume as much of what life’s travels might provide for me so that I will become infinitely more aware of myself as a woman, aspiring artist and informed student.

<div>Hello my dear friends and family. </div>
<div>As many of you know, I have been getting progressively ill.  After countless doctors and treatments, I was finally diagnosed with Lyme Disease In addition to the Crohn's Disease. Even though I celebrated a diagnosis that explains the insanely disparate symptoms, Lyme Disease is extremely complicated to treat because of the numerous co-infections and parasites involved.  For over a year, I have been working with doctor in Denver who treats Lyme with both conventional and alternative medicine. My health is improving, but way slower than expected.  I have been unable to work for the year of treatment, and insurance does not cover the extremely expensive treatment (doctor's visits, testing, prescriptions, and homeopathic medicines etc.). Which means that my husband has been working several jobs, and my parents have been paying most of my medical bills. Blessed!</div>
<div>
<span style="""">So, I'm trying to raise money towards the next couple months of treatment... and a new pair of yoga pants. Encouraged by friends, I started a crowdfunding campaign to get coloring books printed with pictures of my art doodles. If I can get enough people to order 500 copies of the coloring book at $10 a copy, I will reach my goal and be able to get the coloring books printed.  </span><br/>
</div>
<div>The Kaleidoscope Eyes Coloring Book will be 20-pages of my original art doodles, fun to color for both kids and adults!  $10 a copy.  </div>
<div>If you can and feel the inclination, please reserve a copy for yourself or for a gift. I finally figured out the payment process.  To order, please go to the Indiegogo page (link below). Select a perk that designates the number of coloring books you would like.  If you would like more than 10 copies, simply ""contribute"" $10 for each additional copy.  To pay, it will make you go through PayPal, but you do not need an account. </div>
<div>And please share the campaign!  Fifteen days in, we are half-way through the campaign. I could really use your help to reach the goal, which is $5000. If I don't get enough people to reserve copies of the coloring book, you will be refunded at the end the campaign. So there's no risk!  </div>
<div>Thank you to everybody who contributed already, to everyone who purchases a coloring book, and to all you special folks who have encouraged and supported me during this difficult time. Even if I don't meet the goal, I am sincerely overwhelmed by the love and concern. </div>

<p>We are The Crow and 
The Wolf, an artist duo dedicated to furthering human sustainability by 
reconnecting society with it’s primal form of communication, art-making. </p>
<p> Since receiving our bachelors from The Maryland Institute College of Art in 07' and 08', we have collaborated on the development of a new medium, one that combines installation art, film-making, expressive therapy, civic 
involvement, and anthropology. Our passion for social reform coupled 
with our belief that art is a powerful tool for communicating and 
maintaining mental health, inspired us to launch The Crow and 
The Wolf Project. </p>

</div></div>","Our Story.
We are The Crow and 
The Wolf, an artist duo dedicated to furthering human sustainability by 
reconnecting society with it’s primal form of communication, art-making. 
 Since receiving our bachelors from The Maryland Institute College of Art in 07' and 08', we have collaborated on the development of a new medium, one that combines installation art, film-making, expressive therapy, civic 
involvement, and anthropology. Our passion for social reform coupled 
with our belief that art is a powerful tool for communicating and 
maintaining mental health, inspired us to launch The Crow and 
The Wolf Project. 


What's the Project?!
 Community building. Artist and community collaboration. Reformatting what a ""documentary"" is.The Crow and The Wolf 
Project is a mixed-media documentary focused on the current state of Art
 in America and how it is being devalued in our school systems. Our goal
 is to visit communities that have found creative solutions and those 
who are devastated by these cuts to stimulate a productive conversation 
in order to collaborate on solutions. It is time to take matters into our own 
hands! Arts education should NEVER be compromised as it provides a base 
for critical thinking and problem solving skills necessary in a child’s 
developmental stages. By eliminating arts education, we are severely 
handicapping our future generations.We, as artists, educators
 and community members have an obligation to maintain Arts Education 
inside and out of the classroom. If our schools can’t provide sufficient
 art programs, then is our responsibility as a nation to supplement:
reformatting school curriculum to 
incorporate creative activities in academic classes
providing after school programs 

empowering youth to express themselves creatively

Educating about alternative options for art supplies: using recycled materials, developing a second-hand art supply organization in your town, etc.

More than just documenting!
The documentary will combine 
film, photography, writing, audio, installation, book-making and so on) 
that will be presented in an alternative format upon completion. By 
conducting collaborations with like-minded young artists, we will host experimental installation projects & 
impromptu happenings in order to research how collaborative and expressive art can
 shift the mental well being of a community and induce national 
unification in this country. The projects also allows us to fully engage with community members in a artistic fashion, pushing the concept of an ""interview"" to a new level. This is our art.

We intend on finding those voices amongst the 
deserts of Wyoming to the underground establishments of NYC and 
everything in between, and build a family across the states, of 
thinkers, leaders and creators.
Our final presentation of our documentary will be in an installation format somewhere unknown to us at this point.
The location will find us.
Those we meet and collaborate with along the way will be invited to participate it's construction and have the opportunity to collaborate and converse with fellow artists of all mediums in recreating this experience.
 Our goal as creative communicators is to promote self-education, 
social reform through collaboration, and communal empowerment.  In addition to completing a final documentary experience, we want to share with YOU what we learn and experience along the way via our website and blog. Please follow at:
The Crow & The Wolf Project Blog 

As a
 diverse country, we have TONS to share with each other. [ and we do cuz' 
we
 think creatively :)!! ] and we want to help facilitate this sharing! Of course we are excited to share our findings with viewers everywhere 
in the final presentation of a documentary, but we are not just making a
 
documentary about whats going on and how people feel about it, we 
are facilitating a community building process! The communities we engage
 with, through our help and website, will be able to connect with others
 around the country to exchange ideas, solutions, and support on this 
subject. We happily take on the responsibility of unifying. Through our 
website, we will build a database, or as we would like to call it, an
 ""online family"" for the communities we visit to stay in touch with us, 
and meet their neighbors.

The money donated will go to:
Materials for community projects & installations! (paint, brushes, paper, wood, hardware, permit fees we may be faced with for public art opportunities).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>James Creative Shields here. I'm trying to raise $2500 for a solo show I'm having in October. I've been busy in 2012 promoting the Hip Hop Coloring Book and working on a slew of design projects, but this year would not be complete without me presenting a new body of creative works to my audience. This will be my first month long showing in New York. It will be at the Rebar Walkway Gallery in Dumbo, Brooklyn (145 front st.) for the First Thursday's Art Walk. Please help me deliver another great showing complimented by kool merchandise and great people.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you may already know I try to make each show my best show. I want this experience to be just as special for me as it is for those who are able to attend</p>
<p>The money raised will go completely to the production of the show. Your support will allow me to create and you to take part of my creations with you through original artwork and various forms of affordable merchandise.</p>
<p>While i've already started painting I do have a long way to go. Here's the budget:</p>
<p>~30% Supplies (brushes, paints, spray paints, canvas, etc)</p>
<p>~20% Prepping (photographing paintings, framing, promo items)</p>

<p>It should be of no surprise but your support (financially and spiritually) is keeping my dream alive and allowing me to continue to develop as a creator.

<p> </p>
<p>Hi I’m Vedric Jordan, I am a self-taught oil painter/artist, who has never had any formal lessons. I am senior businessat major Troy University. Art is my passion I have drawn since i was a small child but at 17 i drew my first person and at 18 I did my first oil painting. My family thought a business degree would be best so i pursued that goal, but art was always on my mind/heart.</p>
<p>My reason for funding is to be able to supply retail distributors and wholesalers with Lightway art products at the correct quantities for retail distribution, advertising, better storage and decrease manufacturing cost of art products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am looking to move forward with my artwork and custom art products I have over 110 original oil paintings  that I have done since age 18.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I came from nowhere and started with nothing but by God's grace I am pressing forward. I want to move the vision of Lightway Products forward and also help and inspire other entrepreneurs a chance to succeed. I am happy to be able to share some of my original oil paintings with you.</p>

<p>1<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">. Retail Supply Quota and distribution:</span> In order to supply the correct order quota to distributors we need your help, funding will go directly to supplying retails with the correct quotas and wholesale prices that are required. In order to effectively work with distributors for gift shops and stores we have to work with them on prices. With your generous contributions we will be able to lower our production cost and intern lower the wholesale prices to distributors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Cut production cost and lower prices:</span>  By outsourcing production Lightway Products can lower production cost and intern lower our retail prices so that more people can purchase Lightway Products at an affordable price. This would also make it easier to work with more wholesalers and retail distributors.</p>

Hi I’m Vedric Jordan, I am a self-taught oil painter/artist, who has never had any formal lessons. I am senior businessat major Troy University. Art is my passion I have drawn since i was a small child but at 17 i drew my first person and at 18 I did my first oil painting. My family thought a business degree would be best so i pursued that goal, but art was always on my mind/heart.
My reason for funding is to be able to supply retail distributors and wholesalers with Lightway art products at the correct quantities for retail distribution, advertising, better storage and decrease manufacturing cost of art products.
 
I am looking to move forward with my artwork and custom art products I have over 110 original oil paintings  that I have done since age 18.
 
 
 
I came from nowhere and started with nothing but by God's grace I am pressing forward. I want to move the vision of Lightway Products forward and also help and inspire other entrepreneurs a chance to succeed. I am happy to be able to share some of my original oil paintings with you.
 
I’m the creator of  Lightway Products which is an online store to sell my artwork and used electronics dropshipping.
 
Lightway Products LLC
 
 
 
Here is how funding will be invested:
 
1. Retail Supply Quota and distribution: In order to supply the correct order quota to distributors we need your help, funding will go directly to supplying retails with the correct quotas and wholesale prices that are required. In order to effectively work with distributors for gift shops and stores we have to work with them on prices. With your generous contributions we will be able to lower our production cost and intern lower the wholesale prices to distributors.
 
 
2. Cut production cost and lower prices:  By outsourcing production Lightway Products can lower production cost and intern lower our retail prices so that more people can purchase Lightway Products at an affordable price. This would also make it easier to work with more wholesalers and retail distributors.
 
4. Product development; funds will be to make quality lower cost products through specialized outsourcing. Barcodes, metal, fabric, materials, will be purchased for all our Lightway production.
 
5. Secure Storage and work space: Lightway Products will gain have a more appropriate secure venue for storage of items and orders that need to be shipped. Business insurance will be purchased as well.
