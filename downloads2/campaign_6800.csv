My work is included in important museum collections such as the Carnegie Museum of Art (Pittsburgh) and the Osaka Museum of Modern Art in addition to many museum. university, corporate , and private collections, In 2013, I was honored by the city of Pittsburgh with the title of Master Visual Artist as part of their Legacy Program. In addition, I have staged exhibitions across the United States as well as in France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. </p><p>This campaign has powerful importance to me as it arrives at the beginning of my post university life which finds me wanting to engage in new, vital work that I can also share with public institutions via the contemporary print. Our hospitals, schools and libraries struggle with their budgets and are woefully positioned to acquire fine art that will bring new energy to the atmosphere of their respective institutions. To donate original, one of a kind paintings is problematic whereas the gift of the edition print allows me to donate a portion of the work to several causes. It has long been my mantra to seek to design projects wherein everyone ""wins"". </p><p>Contributors to this cause will have the opportunity to directly own my original prints and to have the satisfaction in knowing that this ownership has led to the work being gifted to public institutions. </p><p>The costs of doing large scale, multicolor lithographs are high.

My work is included in important museum collections such as the Carnegie Museum of Art (Pittsburgh) and the Osaka Museum of Modern Art in addition to many museum. university, corporate , and private collections, In 2013, I was honored by the city of Pittsburgh with the title of Master Visual Artist as part of their Legacy Program. In addition, I have staged exhibitions across the United States as well as in France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. This campaign has powerful importance to me as it arrives at the beginning of my post university life which finds me wanting to engage in new, vital work that I can also share with public institutions via the contemporary print. Our hospitals, schools and libraries struggle with their budgets and are woefully positioned to acquire fine art that will bring new energy to the atmosphere of their respective institutions. To donate original, one of a kind paintings is problematic whereas the gift of the edition print allows me to donate a portion of the work to several causes. It has long been my mantra to seek to design projects wherein everyone ""wins"". Contributors to this cause will have the opportunity to directly own my original prints and to have the satisfaction in knowing that this ownership has led to the work being gifted to public institutions. The costs of doing large scale, multicolor lithographs are high.

<h3>World Spirit Who What?</h3> <p>I'm Lauren 'Onça' O'Leary and I want to re-publish my now out-of-print deck and book, the World Spirit Tarot. </p>
<p>In about 1992 I decided to learn to read Tarot, and opted for the most immersive approach possible, researching and CREATING a Tarot deck of 79 unique 6"" x 9"" block-printed images. Seven years of intensive study of the centuries-old traditions, drawing, hand-carving and illuminating finally culminated in the World Spirit Tarot,  published by Llewellyn in 2001. My study-partner Jessica Godino and I co-wrote the accompanying 160 page book, which has received excellent reviews as a well-written, handy guide, making the tarot easy to understand and fun to explore. The WST was declared 'An instant classic' upon publication, and has been translated into Spanish!</p>
<p>My original mission was to make an accessible, multi-cultural and eclectic deck steeped in tradition but reflective of the real people in our lives - big, small, skinny, young, old, black, white and even blue.  It was well-received by the community, being described as the ""Rider-Waite-Smith for modern times"".

The cards have no borders. The dragon-scale like shape of squares ""on tiptoe"" make spreads easily grow from one card image-mandala to an ever greater image, seemingly endlessly.Therefore, the labels on the cards are kept to the bare minimum- instead of titles we just have symbols for your orientation: Roman numerals and elemental or astrological symbols on the majors, Arabian numbers and the element sign on the minors.The courts are also attributed to the elements so instead of Pages/Princesses, Knights/Princes, Queens and Kings we have Earth, Air, Water and Fire in their particular suits of Pentacles/Earth, Swords/Air, Cups/Water and Wands/Fire.  

A further feature of ""navigating"" the cards are the elemental rings formed of the quarter circles surrounding the numbers and symbols at top and bottom of the cards when they are layed out. At one glance you see how the energy flows between cards on your spread in the colours of golden for the majors, green for pentacles/earth, white for words/air, blue for cups/water and red for wands/fire.
Here is a basic spread of four cards from 3 elements and one Major kept together by the elemental ring showing that earth is missing in this spread.  You can interpret the cards in various ways: looking at the axes up-down, right-left, clockwise starting from the east (for example), viewing the four positions as those of the four directions and elements... or you can choose to use your own positions.

</p></div>","Short Summary I have been selected to participate in the Stanislav Libensky Award show in Prague this September. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me, and I need help to get to Prague.  The Stanislav Libensky Award is an international competition for recent graduates who used glass in their final works.  I would love to be able to deliver my workpersonally and to be there to show and represent my piece at the openingnight.  In the show’s five year history, this is the first time Canadian glass is being represented, and I feel privileged to be part of it.
Libensky is my glass hero! I cannot express what an honour it is for me to be selected to participate in this show. The Perks  
I have put together some Perks at different donation levels, and as a show of my gratitude for any support or assistance, everything is listed at discounted rates.

(Octubre  de 2013) se llevó a cabo de
manera maravillosamente exitosa.  El evento dio la bienvenida a 120 participantes, provenientes de 10 países, y cumplió con su cometido de
celebrar las enseñanzas de UN CURSO DE MILAGROS y logró ser un evento de
magnitud transformadora. De ésta manera, las Jornadas de Felicidad (en formato
talleres, charlas y otras actividades), así como el ambiente del festival en sí,
se vivieron con un sentido de innovación, celebración, comunidad y humildad. 
Estamos agradecidos por el apoyo financiero recibido a través de Indiegogo, por nuestro 1er Festival, y por haber podido conseguir nuestra
meta principal de proporcionar los billetes a nuestros 16  maestros invitados de 10 países diferentes, e
inaugurar el festival al cubrir otros gastos iniciales.

NUESTRA META
Estamos comprometidos con ofrecer la 2da Edición del Ibiza Enlight Festival, del 4 al 12 Octubre, 2014, para lo cual, aún habiendo logrado cubrir todos los gastos de la 1ª

Hemos
     concebido y estrenado un Festival -único en su género- para Celebrar Un
     Curso de Milagros  y con mucha alegría ! 
Hemos
     conseguido experimentar por unos días una convivencia comunitaria en la
     que todos nos apoyamos desinteresadamente, en un ambiente de profunda
     conexión interior, y dónde el agradecimiento de todos hacia todos se
     podía respirar. 
Los
     participantes pudieron integrarse en la comunidad de la isla de Ibiza con
     un día de voluntariado en "" Deixalles""   & "" Ibiza 4 Patas "". 
Lo más
     importante: estudiantes
& maestros de UCDM pusimos una dosis de buena voluntad para trascender nuestras
aparentes diferencias y encontrarnos sin juicios más allá de
las culturas y de los idiomas.
Lo que necesitamos y lo que recibirás

Necesitamos aproximadamente 6.500 euros para los 11 billetes; para la web unos +1.500; la edición de fotos y vídeos cuyos precios aún no sabemos y el resto +2.000 para el diseño e impresión de banderolas, material promocional y preparativos iniciales.  

Te ofrecemos nuevamente nuestros Regalos de Gratitud y este año particularmente estamos trabajando en nuestro 'Cuaderno de Gratitud': Un lindo cuaderno para anotaciones, que refleja la dicha y nuestra historia de Amor con hermosas fotos. 

Tu Aportación es muy importante para nosotros.  Cualquiera que sea el monto que logremos recaudar, será invertido con mucho Amor y para el beneficio de la Filiación.   ¡ Muchas Gracias ! 
Con
nuestra petición y tu colaboración también te invitamos a:
DEJAR
IR las diferencias con respecto a la ‘forma’ en que los diversos maestros
enseñan y LIBERAR la idea acerca de que ‘algunas culturas o idiomas son mejores
que otras’. Ayúdanos por favor a COMPARTIR esta campaña con las diversas comunidades de UCDM.Scott/USA, Rod/UK, Carolina/Spain, Marialcira/Venezuela,

The
1st  Edition of the Ibiza Enlight
Festival (October  2013) was a wonderful successful.  The event welcomed 120 participants, from 10
countries and achieved its ultimate goal of celebrating the teachings of  A COURSE IN MIRACLES, in a Week of Happiness
and powerful transformational experiences through workshops, talks and other
activities, in an atmosphere of innovation, celebration, community and
humbleness.  
We
are grateful for the financial support we received through Indiegogo, for our 1st-ever Festival, and for being able to reach all our main objectives: purchasing international tickets for
our 16 teachers invited from 10 different countries and covering the initial
costs necessary to making the festival happen.
http://www.ibizaenlightfestival.com/Healing is a Joint VentureWe are but three, who have joined as One to respond to the calling of
Love. 

IBIZA ENLIGHT is a  not-for-profit  association of recent creation by Carolina
Corada, Steve Thompson and Salvador Rodriguez, whose ultimate goal is to share
A Course in Miracles.
OUR GOALWe are committed
to offering the 2nd Edition of the Ibiza
Enlight Festival, from October 4th to 12th, 2014. 
Even though we were able to cover all the costs of the 1st
Edition, we are still aiming at Crowd Funding and other donation
initiatives to receive the financial
support we need, Indiegogo being one of the most effective ones.

     expenses derived from the pre-production of the event.

OUR IMPACT

We have conceived and
     shared a Festival –unique in its genre- to Celebrate A Course in Miracle
     & with a lot of Joy! 
We were able to
     experience for a few days a community-style living were everyone supported
     each other without hidden agendas, in a profound inner connection where we
     could ‘breathe’ the gratitude everyone had for each other. 
The participants were
     able to ‘shine their light’ and integrate with the island of Ibiza’s
     community through the Volunteering Day at "" Deixalles ""   & "" Ibiza 4 Patas "". 
Most important: ACIM
     students & teachers joined in their willingness to transcend the apparent differences and go beyond judgement, cultures and languages. 
What we need & what you will receive

     the 11 flights; for the web, about +1.500; for the editing &
     videos we don´t yet know, and for the rest, about +2.000 for
     the design & printing of the promotional material and other initial
     expenses.

     story is told in beautiful photos reflecting the joy & the love of the Festival.

With your funding and the hard work of the senior majors, we will have an art show that is professional and spectacular.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The senior art show is a tradition that every Vassar College art major looks forward to upon their graduation. It is an opportunity for us to make an artistic impact on the school and our peers, on the underclassmen, and on all who attend from home or the surrounding area. It is a celebration of all that we have accomplished as a group and allows us to leave campus with a sense of purpose toward our own artistic futures.

They don't show perk fields automatically.You're walking the streets of Divinity's Reach when something familiar catches your eye on the stand. It's a magazine you recognize, one you've picked up before, and it screams out to you like gold to a skritt. You can't help but wonder and you pick it up – What could be in it this time? The Tyrian Gazette project is the annual collaboration of the GW2 Artist Collective, a branch of the Alchemy Art Group. The book’s contributors are making an “in-game” magazine, where all ads, articles and designs are made in a way to recreate how a magazine might look in the world of Tyria if you were walking the streets today. Coming from the talents of 82 contributors, the book asks the readers questions about the world: What is important to them? What would a magazine think is relevant from the standpoint of Divinity’s Reach, bringing in Elonian influences? What would they be looking out for normally? The magazine assumes the role of a periodical that has come out frequently, and is trusted by the city to educate, entertain and inform them of these things.The book's tone is fun and in the spirit of the times, but also serious as it takes a look at current events and how they've impacted the world. (Note: We have put all things from the last living world episode under ""Current Events,"" which is our spoiler section. You can look at the rest of the book spoiler free if you're not caught up.)The goal of the book is to capture the feeling of being a citizen of Tyria by painting our adventures in a moment-to-moment snapshot. We've designed the book to be cohesive and lore-consistent, and any reader should be able to flip through the pages and get a sense of the world that’s been brought to life by the team of Guild Wars 2, and through the contributors who have loved the game for many years. The book has an original cover (Eternity) and one variant specialty cover (Juggernaut). Eternity is the default version. The slip case will be able to be purchased in the post-campaign (unless you purchase it now with the Skritt Box add-on - see details in the Merchandise section).The book is sized at 8.5""x11"" (standard magazine). There is a stretch goal to upgrade it from paperback to hardcover (applies to both the original cover design and variant). In the Tyrian Gazette, we showcase a number of features from a few major sections, including Wintersday, current events, fashion and more. While fashion isn't the whole book, we've dedicated a section to it to show off some creative flair with the ""Fashion Wars"" that the community affectionately partakes in, bringing in our own spin on designs in the game (all looked at by our seamstress for their designs).There are two options for getting the merchandise in the campaign: You can get everything through the Skritt Box right now OR you can wait until the post-campaign to add items on if you want certain things individually.
Pins (Stained Glass Cities) - Only come in the package design when all bought together

Prints of various pieces in the campaign, 8""x10"" - Select 3 available prints (selected in surveys) 

GW2 Coin Set - Coins designed after GW2 in-game currencies, available as a set (1/4 unlocked with the backing card)

Sticker Sheet (Mail Carriers) - Free stretch goal with the books (unlocked)

Individual Vinyl Sticker - TBD - Stretch goals

Holographic Postcard - Free stretch goal with the books (locked)

Slipcase for Book - Available in the Skritt Hoard or an survey add-on (comes already wrapped around the book) (unlocked!)

As noted above, you can add items via the ""add-on tiers"" found when you select the book, or you can wait for the BackerKit program. We've worked with them for several projects, and promise it's a seamless process. For the add-on for both the GW2 limited items (shown under rewards), the wallpapers for desktop and phone, and the skritt box (which features all physical items in the campaign), you can find them by pressing on a book tier and pressing ""add perk"" when it appears below.In this campaign, there are a few specific additions that are listed under ""Add-Ons"" that appear as you're selecting a perk. ArenaNet has donated a few specialty items, listed below, that are only available through the campaign. The proceeds of all of these are donated to charity. The specialty items are:
The Art of Guild Wars 2 (Sold Out)
Signed Tyrian Gazette books from the ArenaNet dev team (Sold Out)
GW2 Toasters (they burn the logo on toast!) (Sold Out)
GW2 Collector's Edition (includes 10-inch Figurine of Rytlock, 112-page Making of Guild Wars 2 book, Best of Guild Wars 2 Soundtrack CD, Art Portfolio and Five Art Prints, and Custom Art Frame, along with other digital items) (Sold Out)
GW1 Nightfall Computer Case (Sold Out)
ALL ITEMS HERE ARE SOLD OUT. (Here is the previous image we had posted - removed on 8/7 since everything was claimed.) We'll notify everyone if this changes!The only other items that are available in the campaign are commissions (see below), merchandise (noted in the previous section - addable in the post-campaign survey sent out to all pledgers OR with the skritt box add-on), and the variant cover edition (Juggernaut).As with previous campaigns, we're offering commissions from some of the participating artists, listed below. Many of our artists do this for a living, and if you like commissioning works, it's a good way to support them! There's a limited number for each tier, and we won't be adding any more. Once you've pledged, we'll send you information via email to connect you with the artist. Examples are listed next to their names; you will have through the end of the campaign to correspond with them and chat about sketches. All tiers include a print of the commission on museum-quality paper (giclee) and a Tyrian Gazette book.ALL COMMISSIONS ARE SOLD AT THIS TIME.

You can't move between the tiers once they've been fully claimed. (If we manage to ship out more than the listed number in a month, we'll move onto the next tier as scheduled. We do these custom shipments by hand so please bear with us!)All duties/import fees are the responsibility of the recipient for international orders, if they apply. Items are declared as required by customs law.For the image above, we've estimated it for a 1,000 count book run. We've estimated these figures to the best of our ability, but prices do fluctuate over time (and percentages with it), along with variables such as varying merchandise counts and costs. We hope that these values hold as true as possible to our projections.As with any project of this size, there are always the potential problems that arise. We've done several projects now of various sizes, and always learn and adjust as much as we can from each.For this project, we have worked to fix some of the logistical issues that happened for shipping in Tyrian Tarot by controlling the tiers and their shipping dates, along with having hard cutoffs for the months. While this creates a limit on what we'll produce, it'll hopefully establish more reasonably expectations for when the books will be in everyone's hands.This is our fourth large charity Guild Wars 2 project, led by the same humans, and one of many big projects that we've done, including independent projects and others for fandoms. We'll be working again to be fulfilling projects as effectively as we can, and promise to communicate any issues or delays if they do occur. We're aiming to have all of the art and writing completed by the time the campaign ends, and will spend the time following the campaign (and the survey) polishing and perfecting the design and layouts. Our goal is to make a memorable campaign that gives to a cause that we (and our sponsoring company) believe in.We hope you're consider supporting the project, and loving the art and world we've trying to honor as much as we do.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><em>The Sound of My Heart</em></strong><span> is a new collective initiated by a small group of women from diverse backgrounds based in Ottawa on Algonquin Territory, whose goal is to carry on the </span><strong>Honouring Indigenous Women</strong><span> (HIW) campaign. HIW's sole mandate is to publish the productions of Indigenous women and their allies through the arts of storytelling, poetry, painting, drawing, photography, and sound.</span></p>
<p>Inspired by the publication - <strong><em>Honouring Indigenous Women, Hearts of Nations - Vol. 1</em></strong>, this campaign will continue to further raise awareness about protecting and honouring Indigenous women and strives to put an end to all forms of violence. It offers a space to deepen our understanding of Indigenous women on Turtle Island (North America) and to foster strong solidarity between native and non-native communities. It is an act of solidarity toward supporting the existing efforts of Indigenous women.</p>
<p>Following the call for the making of <strong><em>Honouring Indigenous Women, Hearts of Nations - Vol. 2</em></strong> (Summer 2012), Indigenous women alongside allies from many nations contributed creative writing, visual art, and photography that reflect lived experiences with regards to their relationship with the land, birth mothers, families, communities, and themselves.</p>
<p>We are very grateful for the authors and artists who courageously shared their stories with us. As a result, this second anthology was born and published online in November 2012.</p>

The Impact
When the Honouring Indigenous Women campaign was launched in 2011, many Indigenous women praised this initiative as it was creating a place for Indigenous women’s voices while offering a complimentary space to allies and alliances. Indigenous women recognized the importance of this space as their voices were not marginalized or on the peripheral. As we have learned, the mainstream media often reinforces stereotypes and patriarchal thinking towards Indigenous women in their stories, and often does not portray the whole picture.
This anthology is a re-presentation of Indigenous women by Indigenous women by  sharing lived experiences, realities and offering unique perspectives of each contributors’ worldview.
It is a celebration and a practice of freedom for both its creators and readers.
Last but not least, the creation of this book has empowered each of us who got involved. We would like to extend our gratitude for this powerful experience to all of you out there who also love and care for equality and justice.

I've been offered an internship with the art collective, HOWDOYOUSAYYAMINAFRICAN. A collective of ""artists, writers, composers, academics, filmmakers and performers from around the world who collaborate across disciplines and cities.” These artists will be installing an exhibit in ""Witte De With"", a museum of contemporary art in Rotterdam, Netherlands. I've been offered the opportunity to help in this installation! My only obstacle, is getting there! 

My Work With the Yams
I've been able to help the collective by helping to install a sculpture in the Jacob Lawrence Gallery in Seattle, Washington entitled “The Immortal Uterus”. It was inspired by Henrietta Lacks, a black woman who had cervical cancer in the 50s. Her cells were extracted from her cervix without her permission and have become the the basis for cell research and medicine, to this day.



This was a project in which we gathered thousands of old VHS tapes, taking them apart one by one, and weaving the film into a massive sculpture! It was a long and tedious job and I even found myself spending the nights in the art gallery and missing a couple hours of school!  However, I've learned so much and have gained so much experience from this project. This instillation has taught me the values of hard work and patience, and art is not to be rushed. I hope to apply these values to my own art.

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""p1"">This is where I need your help, I cant possibility afford all the printing and sending costs all of these cards having spent all of my money on the first batch last time.. The 30 cards cost me $600US to print in good quality and send , so it would cost close to $2000 to print . But it will also cost more to send them with  BETTER quality and BETTER shipping that won't get lost cards. And i most definitely cant afford the plane ticket to Canada and visa costs again! So this is what I'm fundraising for, the cards and plane ticket costs. I humbly request your help with this, you have no idea how much this would mean to me! </p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>

<p class=""p1""></p>
<p class=""p1"">If I don't get the full amount I'll send 50 companies, if i dont get enough for 50 i'll send 10, but whatever I get I'll use it towards my goal like I do with every dollar I've earned for the past 5 years!!!</p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""></p>
<p class=""p1"">For your help I'll send you out custom prints and first issue of my comic books! And I can even make you some custom popup cards too!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""p1"">If you cant afford to donate and you live in Toronto just telling someone about me would also be equally as fantastic! As long as someone can help me out with getting the work visa to come back to the city i love and want to work in I would be forever grateful!  And gently build myself back up so I can work in animation and inspire people like I aimed for all along that would mean EVERYTHING to me</p>

<p class=""p1"">So I started a website 4 years ago , the animators dream where I asked for people's help in helping me achieve the goal of studying the city I've always wanted to live and work at and maybe If I got enough donators I could perhaps reach my goal! You can still find a web archive version of the site at <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20080224013305/http://animatorsdream.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20080224013305/http://animatorsdream.com/</a></p>

<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""> But that's not all, I went out into the streets and did caricatures every day in hopes that i would be able to save enough to get to my goal! </p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">I managed to save up 4-5 thousand over the course of 2 years and my parents god bless them chipped in with all of their savings to give me another 6-7 in order to at least have enough money to afford 1 year! I decided that's enough for me to get started, I spent 1 year  studying my but off there and trying my hardest in Toronto so I can stay and work there! It was amazing! The most amazing city I've lived in, i tried so hard to stay there! But my visa didn't allow me to work there legally so i was stuck, i couldn't apply anywhere! </p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">I had some small work coming in and out, but by the time the school year was over i was completely flat broke! I only had enough money for my plane ticket home… until a job came in. </p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">On which the person said if i finish they'll get me a work visa, guaranteed. It was an animation job and I was super excited! But on the same day my computer broke down…. I couldn't finish the job, I couldn't even start it with no computer! </p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">So I thought well… I've got a thousand left… for my plane ticket…<b> or</b>… I can take a leap of faith! So I spent the money on a new computer instead so I can finish the job and stay!</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">I spent 3 months on the job, barely paying the rent, eating rice and cereal, but all in hope to get the work visa. Well the person lied…they just needed cheap labour and disappeared after i finished the job… Fortunately during that time i saved up enough money little by little to get the plane ticket. And nothing else! I didn't have any choice now, i left the country in the most horrible state. I didn't even have cash for the bus fares to the airport or food on the plane !  </p>
<p class=""p1"">The next year was the most depressing year of my life, i felt like i failed at everything and could never achieve the goal i set out to achieve and was forever stuck here. But then something happened, thanks to amazing artists like Bobby Chiu and Stephen Silver who gave online talks on having a goal and sticking to it no matter what I built my confidence back up until the point where I thought Yeah I can do it! </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""p1"">So what if I'm really far away, why should that stop me?</p>
<p class=""p1"">So I said right I'm going to apply for work now! It doesn't matter if that I'm not in Toronto hopefully SOME place will like me enough to hire me. But I want to be different , if i just email them that wouldn't be special enough… so what would be…..</p>
<p class=""p1""><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pencilsandcoffee.com/all2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""p1"">So I made 30 custom popup cards while with school and work on the side. All  containing my cv and showreel displayed as the surface of the moon inhabited by a small boy and his spaceship like the one above! </p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">
</p>
<p class=""p1"">Spent everything I have on it, and more! Posted it to 30 companies with the cheapest stamps  I  could afford. I got 4 replies, 1 said they don't do the actual animation and they don't hire people but loved my reel, 2 said they love my reel but they don't have work and 1 offered me and internship! But turned  me down when they found out I didn't have a canadian residency…. But those other 25? No response for months! I assume they all got lost in the mail, they were just average letter types so all the work might have just gone lost somewhere. Again I thought what i could i do now… i'm completely out if ideas...</p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""></p>
<p class=""p1""></p>
<div>So I thought I can make a comic book! I can send it out to the Toronto companies, certainly that would make a nice new way of receiving an application! So I made a comic off moon boy!<br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://pencilsandcoffee.blogspot.com/2011/07/moon-boy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://pencilsandcoffee.blogspot.com/2011/07/moon-boy.html</a></p>

<p class=""p1""><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pencilsandcoffee.com/all/1.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Afterwords though It cost me so much to print it i don't think i can afford to send them all out  and what if it gets lost in the mail again...</p>
<p class=""p1"">So I said to myself I can make a better popup card! Even bigger! With my comic book attached to it as well!  With better print quality, more cards, i want to send 100 popup cards to  100 companies, make them ALL custom made for each individual company and send them all out as packages instead of letters so I have more space i can use to design AND they wont get lost in the mail !</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this doesn't happen and I can't get the visa I'll be stuck here as a barman for quite a long while, this is my last bit of hope and I've done every thing i can possibly imagine doing, if this doesn't work out i'll never be able to achieve my dream of inspiring kids and i'll be spending the next 20 years serving drunks in my small town. I really dont want to think like that but it is the worst case scenario. I can only pray that'll never happen and this WILL be successful  I WILL get to Toronto, my goal WILL become a reality</p>

Long Story

Since childhood I've been aiming to work in the cartoon industry and I've always aimed for the top! 5 years ago I decided once and for all that I don't care that I don't live in the US or Canada I can still get there and work on the amazing shows I've watched as a child and inspire children the same way they inspired me!

So I thought I can make a comic book! I can send it out to the Toronto companies, certainly that would make a nice new way of receiving an application! So I made a comic off moon boy!


http://pencilsandcoffee.blogspot.com/2011/07/moon-boy.html


Afterwords though It cost me so much to print it i don't think i can afford to send them all out  and what if it gets lost in the mail again...
So I said to myself I can make a better popup card! Even bigger! With my comic book attached to it as well!  With better print quality, more cards, i want to send 100 popup cards to  100 companies, make them ALL custom made for each individual company and send them all out as packages instead of letters so I have more space i can use to design AND they wont get lost in the mail !




The Impact
If this doesn't happen and I can't get the visa I'll be stuck here as a barman for quite a long while, this is my last bit of hope and I've done every thing i can possibly imagine doing, if this doesn't work out i'll never be able to achieve my dream of inspiring kids and i'll be spending the next 20 years serving drunks in my small town. I really dont want to think like that but it is the worst case scenario. I can only pray that'll never happen and this WILL be successful  I WILL get to Toronto, my goal WILL become a reality




Thank you so much for giving this a shot and like my animators dream site said Every dollar really does count, and when I achieve my lifelong dream I'll have YOU to thank for it!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Barbed Wire Whipping Party was recorded by the Grateful Dead in 1969 for their album
AoxomoxoA, but vetoed from the album at the last second by poet and lyricist Robert Hunter.
 
Now, for the first time, and with Hunter’s permission, the
Dead’s famous 16 track studio experiment is being performed live, while being
interpreted into movement, sculpture, and lighting.
 
We are a group of theatrically trained artists and designers who have been working for nearly a year to interpret the poem and
recording into a collaborative, experimental multi-disciplinary arts
experience.
 
We have identified characters and
a narrative through the text and the audio recording of the poem, and will
build and install our interpretive sculpture and associated lighting at ArtsWalk, a public arts festival in Olympia WA, with a group of performers interpreting the
poem through physical action and vocally re-creating the experience of
listening to the Grateful Dead’s 16-track studio sound collage.

YOUR IMPACT
The funds we raise here are going directly to the material costs for building our set and costumes.  The entire team is donating our time, talent, and limited resources, including flying ourselves across the country on our own dime to implement the vision.  We are still emerging artists, though, and that means we need your help!

We are reaching out to our friends, family, strangers, and fellow fans of the Grateful Dead:

If you can give big, please do.  $100 funds a costume.  $250 funds a tree in the Razor Blade Forest.  If you can't give big, give small. Small donations add up!  If you can't give at all, please spread the word to others by email, Facebook, Twitter, or good old word of mouth!  The more people who know this project is happening the better!

BEYOND ARTSWALK

Our goal for this particular fundraising campaign is $7,000, but our overall goal is $10,000.

If we can raise $10,000 and if the community is receptive to the experience, we hope to tour a version of Barbed Wire Whipping Party around the nation, installing the experience in various cities and ending at Burning Man 2012.  How this project evolves, and what it becomes, depends on you.

My name is Jenniferraye Patterson and I am a Freelance Illustrator that gains inspiration from Movies, TV Shows, Plays, and mostly Video Games (Role-playing ones win my heart always). Just recently, I have taken a liking to attending conventions to expose my name a bit more. Not only have I grown fond memories in doing so at my first two in California (<a href=""http://am2con.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""AM2"">AM2</a> and <a href=""http://anime-expo.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Anime Expo"">Anime Expo</a>) but I've decided to broaden my horizons a bit more - technically at Comikaze Expo first. What better way to take this next stage of promoting my work to a convention beginning near my home in Los Angeles?</p>
<p><br/><strong>What I Need | What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Comikaze Expo begins on September 14-15, and this two-day convention is hosted by the legendary Marvel Creator Stan Lee. If anything, I would like to merge my art with the opportunity to table at Stan Lee's convention, and God willing, handing him my work as a thank-you to being an instant inspiration to this newly-crafted project. And whoever has the heart to help me achieve this goal through any type of contribution (spreading the word, donating, etc.,) will have my eternal thanks and more.<br/><br/>This whole project will be 100% self-made with your funds: Art prints will be printed in my small office, and pins/keychains will be molded on my living room table. <strong>All I ask for is at least $2500 to afford everything</strong> - two sets of button machines | an Epson WorkForce Printer | and an Artist Alley Package to Comikaze Expo as well as the funds for the conventions soon to come: <a href=""http://pacificmediaexpo.info/2012/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Pacific Media Expo"">Pacific Media Expo</a>, <a href=""http://animeicon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""AnimeiCon"">AnimeiCon</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Anim%C3%A9-Los-Angeles/167984293225383"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Anime Los Angeles"">Anime Los Angeles</a>, and <a href=""http://megaconvention.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""MegaCon"">MegaCon</a>. Anything you give, even a dollar, will give you something a small as a Thank You Note + Keychain or as big as a Deluxe Print &amp; Pin Collection for your collective needs and walls. Please review my Updates for information on perks - Art Print previews and gallery updates will be updated every 5-7 days. The hands that help will <strong>not</strong> go unnoticed!</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong><br/>Again, and I don't mean to sound like a pest, but for any of your contributions towards this Project as I branch out to Comikaze and other conventions, I promise to use wisely. It's hard enough to no longer attend college because I'm not ""rich"" enough for 40K tuition, and only being self-employed at home causes me to go so far in my life. View my work here or at <a href=""http://creativejenn.deviantart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""deviantART"">deviantART</a>! If you think my work is good enough to see the world, I encourage you to contribute.</p>

yearsFestival del
Tesechoacan has promoted the musical exchange among
different cultural areas
in Mexico and the world, always performing in open spaces and
free,  so  local people get
to know better the 
richness of our traditions.
Through
concerts, screenings , lectures , workshops , exhibitions and book presentations;
Festival promotes the approach of all generations of our people to the
country's culture also promotes citizen participation not only attending events
, but also through their financial contribution, in kind or the
organization itself. It has allowed
the festival to remain as a community living space .
This year, the
Festival needs your support to finance their activities.We
invite you to help us toreach the
target of fundraising to complement what the population provides. Total amount will
be used to pay transportation of the artists
who  will be performing in
the festival for three nights of free concerts.
El festival es un emotivo
esfuerzo por compartir la cultura musical tradicional de nuestra región con la
mayor cantidad de culturas posibles y enriquecerlas mutuamente. En su escenario
han desfilado ya un importante número de grupos de México y América,
como Cenzontle (E. U. A.), La Familia Duarte (Paraguay), Chico Trujillo
(Chile), Alegrías de a peso (Argentina), Mono Blanco, Los Vega, Los Utrera, Los
Cojolites, entre otros importantes exponentes del son jarocho tradicional,
Mariachi Tradicional Charanda (México DF-Michoacán), solo por mencionar
algunos. Puedes conocer un poco de lo presentado en el festival en el Sound

Sabemos que al hacer este tipo de acciones corremos riesgos y debemos superar desafíos, en caso de no superar la meta fijada en esta campaña el Festival  reducirá el número de artistas participantes, por lo cual tendremos que reorganizar las actividades. En el caso de superar la meta, tendremos un festival como el que está planeado. Pronto estaremos subiendo el cartel en las actualizaciones de la campaña.
We know
that by doing this kind of actions
we take risks and challenges we must overcome, if not exceed the target set in
this campaign the Festival reduce the number of participating artists, so we
will have to reorganize activities.
In the
event of exceeding the goal, we will have a festival like that is planned. Soon
we will be raising the poster campaign updates.

<p><b>MAGNESIUM</b></p>
<p>Magnesium is the lightest metal in our collection! Half the weight of our lightest spinning top and an incredible <b>10x lighter</b> than the tungsten top, this metal weighs even less than some plastics! We want the world to experience this ultra-light solid metal. Have you ever held a solid piece of magnesium in one hand and a piece of tungsten in the other? The weight difference is mind-blowing! Aside from the weight, you'll love the color and how playful it is.</p>
<p><b>Words that describe Magnesium:</b> Nimble - Playful -Ultra light</p>
<p><b>DAMASCUS STEEL</b></p>
<p>Dating back to the 3rd century, Damascus steel is fabricated by forging layers of steel together to create beautiful intrinsic patterns of steel. Due to the forging process, the production of this metal is incredibly labour-intensive. The same process makes the metal very hard, making it a favorite in ancient weapon crafting and especially in the production of swords. Since the fabrication of material is done by hand, no two damascus spinning tops are the same, making your damascus top one of a kind.</p>
<p><b>Words that describe Damascus Steel:</b> Classic - Epic - Lost in Time</p>
<p><b>BLACK ZIRCONIUM</b></p>
<p>An exotic, rare super-metal! In its natural state, zirconium is silvery-grey but creates a natural, beautiful, jet-black oxide layer when heated at high temperatures. This layer makes it incredibly durable and scratch-resistant - its black lustrous finish is very beautiful making this the ultimate black spinning top.</p>

<p><b>SILVER</b></p>
<p>Silver: Owning a spinning top made from Solid Silver is something very special. Silver possesses very unique properties such as having the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and highest reflectivity of any metal. Like all of our spinning tops, we CNC-machined this spinning top from a solid block which requires almost one pound of solid silver per top. Silver has a brilliant white metallic luster, is considered a precious metal, and many times, has served as a form of currency.

The Fergus
Falls Public Arts Commission (FFPAC) is excited to begin its first major
project this spring and summer, and we need YOUR help to make it a reality! 
""Freedom,""
a sculpture designed by Duluth artist Ann Klefstad, will be installed in the
new roundabout at Alcott and Tower Road in Fergus Falls. The sculpture, due to
be completed by Fall 2015, will stand at 20 feet high and is made of
aluminum and steel. It depicts birds in playful flight, reminiscent of “heart stirring”
flocks of birds following a tractor in a field during harvest time, according
to Klefstad. The sculpture will serve as an expressive and memorable gateway to
the city for both residents and visitors, reminding viewers of the environmental
and cultural assets that make our region so unique. 
The
sculpture was chosen through a highly engaged process. In July 2013, FFPAC
announced a call for proposals from artists, which attracted 13 proposals from
11 different artists. A community selection committee was formed of 12 people
to review all proposals. The group included artists, property owners near the
roundabout, business owners, interested citizens, and elected officials. The
group met for a total of 8 hours over the course of 1.5 months, closely evaluating
and discussing each proposal based on its relevance to the community of Fergus
Falls, safety, cost of upkeep, and the experience and credibility of the
artists. ""Freedom,"" was the top sculpture recommended to FFPAC based this
criteria, and the FFPAC unanimously voted to move forward on making the
sculpture a reality.
There are
few artists in the state of Minnesota as experienced as Ann Klefstad in
designing fabricating high quality, lasting public art. Klefstad’s commissioned work has
appeared all around the state of Minnesota, including the Lake Superior Zoo,
Columbia Garden Park in Minneapolis, Franconia Sculpture Garden, and at the
Harriet Island Plaza, (a project which was given an American Institute of
Landscape Architects Merit Award!) Check out our gallery to view some of her finished projects! 
 
What We Need & What You Get The total project budget for ""Freedom"" is approximately $40,000. We want at least 25% of that funding to come from people like you, which is why our goal on this site is only $10,000. The rest of the funds needed are being raised through major private donors, businesses, and grant funds. By donating to this campaign, even if it's just a small amount, we're able to show these larger funders that there are people in Fergus Falls who want this project to happen. 
And, crowdfunding is a fun way to support a project in the community, because you get cool gifts! Check out our great incentives, from a limited edition I Heart Fergus Falls Art sticker, to beautiful prints or models of the sculpture that you can display in your home or office!

of their cultural milieu. Absent public art, we would be absent our human
identities.”  
Smaller
communities throughout rural Minnesota are struggling to make themselves
distinct. What a place looks like is
often the first thing people notice or remember when they consider a town’s
identity. Public art has been proven to play a big role in making
cities and towns places where people want to live and visit. 
We believe that placing a beautiful sculpture in a
gateway location such as the Tower Road roundabout, immediately sends the
message to visitors that Fergus Falls is a community that has pride in its
appearance and invests in a positive sense of identity. 
 Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute financially, please think to yourself right now if there's someone you know who loves public art that could donate, and share this page with them personally. 
And of course, share this page on your social media pages frequently throughout the campaign! We can't do this alone!

<p>The glass cyphers is a new collaborative project between film maker/digital artist Paul Miller and glass artist Griet Beyaert. We are both self-employed artists met in 2013 and found a lot of common ground in our work despite using completely different mediums. This led to us experimenting with small glass sculptures and projected video imagery and exploring the way that the moving light interacted with the intricate form of the glass. The results were immediately exciting and we decided to further develop this work and do more experimenting. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From this we have developed plans for an installation which will comprise the creation and projection of moving images onto sculpted glass works (around 20 large pieces), suspended above the audience. The digital content will be contained on and inside the glass pieces through the technique of projection mapping which involves creating a complex virtual version of the sculptures to be as a mask for the light, preventing projection outside of the intended piece. The effect as the audience moves in the areas beneath the pieces will be of self-contained, floating light-spaces; the perception of the solidity of objects is removed and new space is created.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The project is due to commence on 24<sup>th</sup> August 2015 with an intense work schedule culminating in an event over three nights at Left Bank Leeds, UK, a spectacular venue which is a converted church; 9-11<sup>th</sup> October. </p>
<h3><b>The Future</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the longer term the work that comes from this will form the basis of what we can take forward so that the pieces, along with documentation of the project and events will help promote our ideas for future installations and commissions; it is envisaged that the collaboration can develop and grow, finding new audiences. The work is also naturally adaptable, giving scope for site-responsive versions in future venues; so the benefit of the project will be ongoing. </p>
<h3>Delivering</h3>
<p>This is an ambitious project with a challenging time-frame, which we have carefully planned and scheduled with contingencies for production. Both artists are experienced in producing work and installing complex work in large spaces. </p>

<h3>Support</h3> <p></p>
<p>Your support will help get the project underway, buying materials and glass firings (which will cost a total of £1714 for the full 20 sculptures to be completed). </p>
When you contribute to the campaign, you don't give something for nothing. At each contribution level, there are <b>perks</b> you receive in return for your contribution.<br/><br/>For Example:<br/><ul>
<li>Contribute at the <b>£60 level</b> and you will receive a <b>limited edition signed artists' prints from a series of photographed images of the glass projections. </b>
</li>
<li>Contribute at the <b>£150 level</b> and you will receive <b>a unique glass work printed with imagery from the projection works.</b>

<p><b>Where do the funds go if we don't reach our goal?</b></p>
<p>Since we have chosen the ""flexible funding"" option, all contributions will still go towards the project, with a slightly increased fee from Indiegogo. So whatever happens with the campaign, the project will go ahead, tailored to the funding we receive and perks will be distributed to those who made contributions.</p>

<p>The workshop costs about $1600 including room and board.  It may seem like a steep price to just go write somewhere I don't live, but there are writers there that I want to learn from.  Steve Almond.  Karen Russell.  Dana Spiotta.  Excellent, accomplished writers all in one place for a week-long intensive that will not only get me feedback on my work from authors I admire, but also allow me to dedicate my undivided attention to a piece of fiction, something I never get to do for that long a period of time uninterrupted by my monotonous (but necessary) office job.</p>
<p>Beyond the cost of the workshop itself, there's air fare for the trip, as well as travel costs to get down to California for the shows I'd like to do.  I'll need your help If I'm going to make this happen, and I want nothing more than to refine my writing in a forest and perform poems for you on the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>Reasons to donate are endless, but here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>you love and support independent art</li>
<li>you love ghost stories and want to read mine</li>
<li>you want to see me read perform on the West Coast</li>
<li>you want swim in the Pacific Ocean with me</li>
<li>you want to send me to Oregon to get rid of me for awhile</li>
</ul>
<p>All valid reasons to donate.  But if those aren't enough, there will be prizes!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In exchange for the cash to defray travel and workshop costs for my trip to Oregon and California you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>a snail mail smooch for your generosity</li>
<li>art handmade by me to treasure for a lifetime</li>
<li>limited edition chapbooks unavailable anywhere else in the whole wide world</li>
</ul>
<p>And if I don't reach my projected goal, you'll get your art no matter what, so there's no reason not to donate!  Any little bit helps, even if it's just the price of a cup of coffee.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you've found this page, you've probably read or heard my writing somewhere (if you haven't, come <a href=""http://emily-oneill.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">have a look</a>).  I am a working artist, which means I essentially work two jobs: one to pay the bills, and one completely out of love.  My candle is forever on fire at both ends.  Publishing poetry and fiction in literary magazines and journals is not lucrative, and getting the individual attention provided by workshops like this one is invaluable to advancing my craft.  Same goes for performing in new places--every person I've ever spoken to on tour has taught me something about why I am writing.</p>
<p>If I meet my goal, I'll be rewarded with the time and resources to learn more about myself as a writer, and you'll get the satisfaction of knowing you directly supported the career of an artist willing to do whatever it takes to succeed.  But remember, I need your help to get there.</p>

<p>Add-a-Handle is a solution for all!</p>
<p>""Seriously, how?"" you say, in that prove it tone.  Didn't you watch the Video? If not scroll up and do so! See, <i>seriously! </i>It's all coming together, right? Add-a-Handle [AAH] can be used in thousands of situations (the video just showed a few), it's all about the design which allows for three practical applications:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290877/files/20150312155305-3_uses_final_artwork__1_.jpg?1426200785"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 309px;""/></p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>It’s that product that
if you don't get one, you will have a ""AAH"" moment one day and say, ""Arrghh that <i>#@%*  </i>Add-a-Handle would have worked for
this!""</p>
<p>Add-a-Handle is
light-weight, about the same as a stick
of butter.<img alt=""4 oz"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1293169/files/20150313141311-butter.jpg?1426281191"" src="""" style=""float: right; width: 137.430379746835px; height: 77px;""/>  So, anyone with Arthritis or health
concerns can maneuver it. <i> Who doesn't love butter? </i>Made in the USA so you know it is sturdy
and strong. How strong you ask? Holds up to 30lbs. -  that's strong enough to hold my three
year old daughter! <img alt=""30 lb"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1293086/files/20150313135129-muscle1sm.jpg?1426279889"" src="""" style=""float: left; padding: 10px; width: 240px; height: 337.81px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>[Umm, that is JUST a weight
reference, though tempting, <u>DO NOT</u> use it on your children!]  We have designed it
with two adjustable Velcro Buckle Straps which allow you to securely carry,
hook or hold your desired object!  No matter what the shape! Well, as long as
the straps fit it; currently, the standard strap size included is 18"" but
other sizes will be offered, (possibly on here, if/when we hit our “Stretch Goal”). <i>Oh, but there is more! </i>We cannot forget the
handy magnet atop the handle. It was added to the design for pure convenience!
The magnet will hold your wet paintbrush, can opener, 9-volt battery flashlight,
putty knife or whatever your special needs call for!</p>
<p>That is how <b><i>We
Have it Handled</i> </b> for you! Almost every time I show Add-a-Handle to
someone they come up with some other way they would
use it, or someone else they know who would find it indispensable.  That's why I am here. I
<i>know</i> Add-a-Handle is a useful tool for many; while, it could be an essential aid for others. Add-a-Handle can give them back just a little independence they may have lost. I have seen it first hand. If for no other reason than that, I hope you see Add-a-Handle as the ideal product to fund!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Who does Add-a-Handle help and how?</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>You! How can we state that without knowing you? Simple, Add-a-Handle covers that many different uses! </b></p>
<p><b>Do you...</b></p>
<p><b>paint </b>- trim work? Paint straight from the can and stop wasting money on liners, time on clean-up, all while easing hand cramps.</p>
<p><b>pour</b> - wine seems to be the favorite.  Attach it to a bottle and be in control again, no more spills, one had on cup and one pouring.</p>
<p><b>use a utility ladder </b>- carry it without marking up your walls or pinching your hands.  Place the grip inside the tool hole while having your can strapped and transport everything all at once, no more spills or bending over. What else could you hang? Or, close the ladder when you are finished and carry it like a briefcase!</p>
<p><b>have a special need - </b>whether it is Arthritis, MS, Parkinson's, various cancers, weakness, on crutches or use a rollator we have a use for you!  Be more in control with two of the ways you can use Add-a-Handle: hang it on your hand or grip it! We chose the straps with the most user-friendly buckles, specifically mindful of those with finger dexterity issues. Don't forget, it can initially be attached by someone else then used by you at your convenience!</p>
<p><b>use an extension ladder </b>- use it as a hook to hang your cords, hoses or whatever. While the ladder is still safely on the ground load up the inverted Add-a-Handle with whatever it is you would need up top. Stand it up and everything is right where you need it, without someone else having to hand it up to you, or you trying to climb the ladder with your hands full! Safety first!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>push a stroller</b> - attach to side of stroller and hang bags or use as a hand bar for an older child.  It adds not only peace of  mind that your second child is holding on safely, but it gives them that extra space from the wheel so they don't bump into it.</p>
<p><b>use the great outdoors as your lavatory</b><b> </b>- attach as a hook and now your toilet paper remains dry and clean.  Better yet, instead of fumbling in the dark, use the attachable 9-volt battery flashlight to get there, and then clip it to the top magnet - now you can see when you have to <i>go</i>.</p>
<p><b>use a hospital bed</b>- no more losing items.  Attach a canister, now you don't have to scramble to find your remote, or cell phone or a pen in the sheets, or worse, on the floor!</p>
<p><b>play outdoor sports - </b>how much did you pay for that bag or that jacket? Don't put them on the ground again, use the handle as a hook and you have a portable, quick and simple solution.  Also good for keeping wandering hands out of reach of valuables and ensuring that you can spot your bag from across the court!</p>
<p><b>do winter chores - </b>hate getting ice melt on your gloves or hands? Attach a coffee can or such and scoop it up. You can even keep your gloves on!</p>

<h3>Add-a-Handle: to pull a family together</h3> <p>This project spans two generations.  Mike Payne is the first generation.  He is the ""Inventor"" - he has been a bit of a frustrated Engineer all his life.  Not being a book trained designer, he works old school.  He waits for something to annoy him, then he works out a solution.  For the most part it stops there.  He may make a few prototypes, share them with people he likes, then move on to some other irritation. Tara (Payne) Vallin is the second generation.  She gets frustrated when all these great work-arounds just <i>sit</i> around.  This time she decided to do something about it!  She has picked up the gauntlet and is going to prove that a good idea should be shared.  And she will further prove that there is nothing unethical about making some money along the way!</p>
<p></p>
</div><p>The motivation behind
the original design was simple.  Mike is handy around the house: building
things, lots of repairs and painting.  He has NEVER liked painting the trim
work.  He has found over the years that after not-so-long his hands and
fingers would cramp from holding the quart size paint can.  He bought all
the gadgets on the market and none of them suited all his purposes - easy to use,
easy to clean, easy to store, saves time, saves money- and most important - no annoying stress on his
body.  His first solution was to use an empty plastic coffee can.  It
was lighter, and the cramping took quite a bit longer to start, but there it
was.... The next stage was to pick up the commercial pail that had a handle
built in, but his wife never had any single-color paint projects.  So, then
there had to be multiple pails and what about all the cleaning in-between as he never remembered the liners when at the store.  Soon
after, old beer pitchers started disappearing around the house.  His first
prototype showed up about two years ago.  At first, he was content filing
the patent paperwork (not his first) and trying to sell the whole
kit-and-caboodle to one of the major paint companies. </p>
<p>Tara on the other
hand-le saw the full potential of this latest work-around.  It had so many
more practical uses than merely painting trim.  Unfortunately, Tara has
had some personal tragedy and has seen first hand what a God-send this
solution could be for folks with physical limitations.  But then, as her
perspective changed, so did her vision.  No longer limited to paint cans
and hospital beds...it became a go-to-tool for so many other everyday uses. She
approached Mike and said, ""I want to make this happen..."" He said,
""<i>...run with it!</i>"" He filed the final Patent paperwork and they were on their way.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>This is what we have done...</b></h3>
<p>Mike made a variety of prototypes early on, and from there Tara did her research,</p><p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297302/files/20150315165247-White_D_handle_w_one_wrap.jpg?1426463567"" src="""" style=""width: 274px; height: 256px;""/>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1297295/files/20150315165053-white_old_handle.jpg?1426463453"" src="""" style=""width: 273.79679144385px; height: 256px;""/>
</p><p></p> received tons of feedback and did lots of
testing with her own prototypes. Tara, like her Dad, is handy and a problem
solver, so she learned how to make her own prototypes. Through the
many stages of this process she has been able to make her own temporary molds
with a great product called Smooth-On. This allowed her to re-design as needed. It also allowed her to create a number of repeat handles in order to have them tested by people who would most likely use them once commercially available.  It has been very important to make sure they remain practical, comfortable and functional. <p>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1294731/files/20150314120907-Mold_for_Indie.jpg?1426360147"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Tara began
working with Eric Fasser a Design Engineer to tweak the Add-a-Handle so that
it would be ready to take it to an injection molder and begin production. Once Eric completed the initial drawings several very affordable 3D-prints were made locally by Ed Hebel at Free Thought Designs. <br/><br/><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296932/files/20150315133212-_DSC0012.JPG?1426451532"" src="""" style=""width: 284px; height: 188px;""/>            

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296934/files/20150315133322-_DSC0015.JPG?1426451602"" src="""" style=""width: 284px; height: 188px;""/></p>

This afforded us the opportunity to experiment with the future assembly of the handle as well as to see and feel the changes that were made quickly and cost-effectively.  As one of our primary goals was to keep the product in
the USA, we thought why not keep the product truly local, and start with companies in
our home state of NY?  As a single mom this also means Tara could spend more time with her little daughter as
well!  Once the material for Add-a-Handle was
chosen, it limited the companies available and she began working with one.  They were not the right fit and after months
of going back and forth it came to a parting of the ways.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Lessons learned.  But since </span><b style=""background-color: initial;""><i>We Have
it Handled</i></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, we will keep on trucking along! </span>
</div><div>
<div>
<br/><h3><b>This is where we are at...</b></h3>
<div>
<div>Currently, we are engaged in talks with a new local company, and getting their feedback on how to take
this full speed ahead. However, we are not limiting ourselves and have quotes from others as well.</div>
<div>
<p>We have several goals
ahead of us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure a new Injection Mold Company, preferably local</li>
<li>Create a great following of people who want to see
     Add-a-Handle succeed - <i>Let's go Viral!</i>
</li>
<li>Gain media coverage to get the word out</li>
<li>Get the Metal Mold made</li>
<li>Cast high quality products...here in the USA</li>
<li>Display and present at the National Hardware Show, in Las Vagas, May 2015</li>
<li>Have our Indiegogo campaign go above and beyond our goal </li>
<li>Get all our amazing backers their Perks!</li>
<li>Finalize packaging</li>
<li>Begin selling Add-a-Handle via our website and Amazon</li>
<li>Acquire purchase orders so Add-a-Handle gets into the brick 'n mortar stores and sells off the shelves!</li>
<li>Be another American woman-owned business success story!</li>
<li>Start again with our next product…</li>
</ul>
<p>Crowdfunding is a
great means of getting Add-a-Handle the financial support it needs, but it is a
lot of work and that is why we have brought in CrowdfundBuzz. We know we cannot
do this alone and that is why we also need your support, financially and/or by your word of mouth and posting.  We truly
believe that Add-a-Handle can help so many, please <i>Pay it Forward</i> by spreading the
word, it might be because of <i>you </i>that someone else gains a little more ease in their day!
 </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
<h3><b>Where the funds have come from and where your funds will go…</b></h3>
<p>Tara was a CFO before getting married
and is always running the numbers to make sure they work and that this is
financially feasible.  Rest assured, the funds will be accounted for and applied to get this product off the ground!</p>
<p>Currently, Tara has been funding We Have it
Handled Corp with her own funds. She had stopped working when she and Guillaume
got married.  They were blessed with a beautiful baby girl and the plan was that she would go back to work when the baby turned one.  Unfortunately, Guillaume was diagnosed with terminal
cancer the day before their first wedding anniversary. Seven months later Guillaume passed away. Guillaume made sure there were life insurance
policies in place, he was always the planner. Seeing the potential success of
Add-a-Handle Tara decided to invest her own savings and take the risk.  We hope that this
makes you feel confident in doing the same!</p>
<p>Our goal is set at $28,000; however, we are confident kind people like yourself will help us to soar way passed that! For the people who are new to Indiegogo, if we do not reach our goal they charge a 9% fee plus credit card processing fees.  If/when we do reach our goal, then there is a 4% charge plus processing fees.  We have taken this into account and chosen to go with a lower financial goal so that there is more money in our pocket later. Always plan
for the worst when it comes to fees!  We
are still waiting on quotes for 1- and 4-cavity molds. Clearly, the less machine time an
injection molder spends on your product, the lower per piece price, and then we can
offer an economic selling price to the buyer.</p>
<p>Once we have the mold made we can then
start production. We have all the suppliers in place and they are ready and
excited about taking what was once an idea through to having a product in your hands! Again, they are all in the USA and we will be using the brand VELCRO® because quality
matters to us! So let’s talk money. The minimum order we can place and have a decent price point is for 5000 units. If 5000 or more Add-a-Handles are redeemed in
PERKs then we will be ecstatic and ready! Please help make this happen. We will definitely know we are doing
something right. Let’s hope that happens, but if not it is ok! Once we have product in our hands we can use them for marketing and sales. We already have small companies that are interested in selling them, but we need funding to get the mold made first.</p>
<p>Thank you for your funding and support, in advance, and if you have any questions, concerns or words of encouragement please contact us!  Come back soon so you can see our future updates and progress. </p>
<p>LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN! Don't forget to ""LIKE"" us on Facebook!</p>
<p><i>Merci Beaucoup</i> :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></h3>
<div>
As you have noticed, Add-a-Handle does not have any
batteries, cords or need technological upgrades, so no worries about there being
an electrical issue, because <i>We Have it Handled</i>!  We want to assure everyone that we will keep
you posted with updates here and on our website, <a href=""http://www.add-a-handle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">www.add-a-handle.com</a>,
throughout the campaign.  If you post
questions we will be sure to get back to you as soon as possible.</div>
<div>
With all campaigns there is an element of risk.  At <i> We Have it
Handled Corp</i> we are able to produce a hand-crafted Add-a-Handle for each PERK
redeemed.  If for some reason the support is not fully there, and we cannot get
the tooling done right away we will still do our best to fulfill our obligations. You won’t let that happen though,<i> right</i>? That is how
committed we are to show our thanks!

While the ladder is still safely on the ground load up the inverted Add-a-Handle with whatever it is you would need up top. Stand it up and everything is right where you need it, without someone else having to hand it up to you, or you trying to climb the ladder with your hands full! Safety first!

push a stroller - attach to side of stroller and hang bags or use as a hand bar for an older child.  It adds not only peace of  mind that your second child is holding on safely, but it gives them that extra space from the wheel so they don't bump into it.
use the great outdoors as your lavatory - attach as a hook and now your toilet paper remains dry and clean.  Better yet, instead of fumbling in the dark, use the attachable 9-volt battery flashlight to get there, and then clip it to the top magnet - now you can see when you have to go.
use a hospital bed- no more losing items.  Attach a canister, now you don't have to scramble to find your remote, or cell phone or a pen in the sheets, or worse, on the floor!
play outdoor sports - how much did you pay for that bag or that jacket? Don't put them on the ground again, use the handle as a hook and you have a portable, quick and simple solution.  Also good for keeping wandering hands out of reach of valuables and ensuring that you can spot your bag from across the court!
do winter chores - hate getting ice melt on your gloves or hands? Attach a coffee can or such and scoop it up. You can even keep your gloves on!


Add-a-Handle: to pull a family together This project spans two generations.  Mike Payne is the first generation.  He is the ""Inventor"" - he has been a bit of a frustrated Engineer all his life.  Not being a book trained designer, he works old school.  He waits for something to annoy him, then he works out a solution.  For the most part it stops there.  He may make a few prototypes, share them with people he likes, then move on to some other irritation. Tara (Payne) Vallin is the second generation.  She gets frustrated when all these great work-arounds just sit around.  This time she decided to do something about it!  She has picked up the gauntlet and is going to prove that a good idea should be shared.  And she will further prove that there is nothing unethical about making some money along the way!

The motivation behind
the original design was simple.  Mike is handy around the house: building
things, lots of repairs and painting.  He has NEVER liked painting the trim
work.  He has found over the years that after not-so-long his hands and
fingers would cramp from holding the quart size paint can.  He bought all
the gadgets on the market and none of them suited all his purposes - easy to use,
easy to clean, easy to store, saves time, saves money- and most important - no annoying stress on his
body.  His first solution was to use an empty plastic coffee can.  It
was lighter, and the cramping took quite a bit longer to start, but there it
was.... The next stage was to pick up the commercial pail that had a handle
built in, but his wife never had any single-color paint projects.  So, then
there had to be multiple pails and what about all the cleaning in-between as he never remembered the liners when at the store.  Soon
after, old beer pitchers started disappearing around the house.  His first
prototype showed up about two years ago.  At first, he was content filing
the patent paperwork (not his first) and trying to sell the whole
kit-and-caboodle to one of the major paint companies. 
Tara on the other
hand-le saw the full potential of this latest work-around.  It had so many
more practical uses than merely painting trim.  Unfortunately, Tara has
had some personal tragedy and has seen first hand what a God-send this
solution could be for folks with physical limitations.  But then, as her
perspective changed, so did her vision.  No longer limited to paint cans
and hospital beds...it became a go-to-tool for so many other everyday uses. She
approached Mike and said, ""I want to make this happen..."" He said,
""...run with it!"" He filed the final Patent paperwork and they were on their way.
This is what we have done...
Mike made a variety of prototypes early on, and from there Tara did her research,
                  
 received tons of feedback and did lots of
testing with her own prototypes. Tara, like her Dad, is handy and a problem
solver, so she learned how to make her own prototypes. Through the
many stages of this process she has been able to make her own temporary molds
with a great product called Smooth-On. This allowed her to re-design as needed. It also allowed her to create a number of repeat handles in order to have them tested by people who would most likely use them once commercially available.  It has been very important to make sure they remain practical, comfortable and functional.    Tara began
working with Eric Fasser a Design Engineer to tweak the Add-a-Handle so that
it would be ready to take it to an injection molder and begin production. Once Eric completed the initial drawings several very affordable 3D-prints were made locally by Ed Hebel at Free Thought Designs. 
            



This afforded us the opportunity to experiment with the future assembly of the handle as well as to see and feel the changes that were made quickly and cost-effectively.  As one of our primary goals was to keep the product in
the USA, we thought why not keep the product truly local, and start with companies in
our home state of NY?  As a single mom this also means Tara could spend more time with her little daughter as
well!  Once the material for Add-a-Handle was
chosen, it limited the companies available and she began working with one.  They were not the right fit and after months
of going back and forth it came to a parting of the ways.  Lessons learned.  But since We Have
it Handled, we will keep on trucking along! 


This is where we are at...

Currently, we are engaged in talks with a new local company, and getting their feedback on how to take
this full speed ahead. However, we are not limiting ourselves and have quotes from others as well.

We have several goals
ahead of us:

Secure a new Injection Mold Company, preferably local
Create a great following of people who want to see
     Add-a-Handle succeed - Let's go Viral!

Gain media coverage to get the word out
Get the Metal Mold made
Cast high quality products...here in the USA
Display and present at the National Hardware Show, in Las Vagas, May 2015
Have our Indiegogo campaign go above and beyond our goal 
Get all our amazing backers their Perks!
Finalize packaging
Begin selling Add-a-Handle via our website and Amazon
Acquire purchase orders so Add-a-Handle gets into the brick 'n mortar stores and sells off the shelves!
Be another American woman-owned business success story!
Start again with our next product…

Crowdfunding is a
great means of getting Add-a-Handle the financial support it needs, but it is a
lot of work and that is why we have brought in CrowdfundBuzz. We know we cannot
do this alone and that is why we also need your support, financially and/or by your word of mouth and posting.  We truly
believe that Add-a-Handle can help so many, please Pay it Forward by spreading the
word, it might be because of you that someone else gains a little more ease in their day!
 


Where the funds have come from and where your funds will go…
Tara was a CFO before getting married
and is always running the numbers to make sure they work and that this is
financially feasible.  Rest assured, the funds will be accounted for and applied to get this product off the ground!
Currently, Tara has been funding We Have it
Handled Corp with her own funds. She had stopped working when she and Guillaume
got married.  They were blessed with a beautiful baby girl and the plan was that she would go back to work when the baby turned one.  Unfortunately, Guillaume was diagnosed with terminal
cancer the day before their first wedding anniversary. Seven months later Guillaume passed away. Guillaume made sure there were life insurance
policies in place, he was always the planner. Seeing the potential success of
Add-a-Handle Tara decided to invest her own savings and take the risk.  We hope that this
makes you feel confident in doing the same!
Our goal is set at $28,000; however, we are confident kind people like yourself will help us to soar way passed that! For the people who are new to Indiegogo, if we do not reach our goal they charge a 9% fee plus credit card processing fees.  If/when we do reach our goal, then there is a 4% charge plus processing fees.  We have taken this into account and chosen to go with a lower financial goal so that there is more money in our pocket later. Always plan
for the worst when it comes to fees!  We
are still waiting on quotes for 1- and 4-cavity molds. Clearly, the less machine time an
injection molder spends on your product, the lower per piece price, and then we can
offer an economic selling price to the buyer.
Once we have the mold made we can then
start production. We have all the suppliers in place and they are ready and
excited about taking what was once an idea through to having a product in your hands! Again, they are all in the USA and we will be using the brand VELCRO® because quality
matters to us! So let’s talk money. The minimum order we can place and have a decent price point is for 5000 units. If 5000 or more Add-a-Handles are redeemed in
PERKs then we will be ecstatic and ready! Please help make this happen. We will definitely know we are doing
something right. Let’s hope that happens, but if not it is ok! Once we have product in our hands we can use them for marketing and sales. We already have small companies that are interested in selling them, but we need funding to get the mold made first.
Thank you for your funding and support, in advance, and if you have any questions, concerns or words of encouragement please contact us!  Come back soon so you can see our future updates and progress. 
LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN! Don't forget to ""LIKE"" us on Facebook!
Merci Beaucoup :)

RISKS AND CHALLENGES

As you have noticed, Add-a-Handle does not have any
batteries, cords or need technological upgrades, so no worries about there being
an electrical issue, because We Have it Handled!  We want to assure everyone that we will keep
you posted with updates here and on our website, www.add-a-handle.com,
throughout the campaign.  If you post
questions we will be sure to get back to you as soon as possible.

With all campaigns there is an element of risk.  At  We Have it
Handled Corp we are able to produce a hand-crafted Add-a-Handle for each PERK
redeemed.  If for some reason the support is not fully there, and we cannot get
the tooling done right away we will still do our best to fulfill our obligations. You won’t let that happen though, right? That is how
committed we are to show our thanks!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><i>Trash Temple</i> will be co-created in the grassroots artspace Chaosmos_/79Au, Athens. Used golden beer cans of a Greek brand will be collected from the streets in order to provide the base material of large-scale installations: golden hybrids from inorganic to botanical, reptilian and bird-like creatures will occupy the space, build gates and tunnels inspired by Maya architecture, climb up walls until the rooftop …</p>

<p>Apart from the practical removal of trash from the streets, the project will raise awareness about waste disposal and serve as a shining example how even problematic issues can be turned into art and beauty. The display of golden hybrids, moreover, makes the community aware that hybridity can be more beautiful than homogeneity and should rather be acknowledged than trying to avoid it. Working creatively with homeless and jobless people for an appropriate fee will also be a great support in the sense of a temporary job and give them the opportunity to be included in creating something positive for their neighbourhood.</p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>On a highly philosophical level, the project is inspired by the attempt of the modern writer James Joyce to raise the mundane and every-day-experience on the level of sophisticated art and beauty. In a similar sense, it is inspired by ancient and medieval alchemy which, famously, had the ambition to create gold out of minor elements. As the philosopher and ethnobotanist Terence McKenna suggests, this ""quest for gold"" is, however, not to be understood literally but metaphorically, as a quest to purify spiritually. Moreover, the concrete forms of the installations are inspired by the temple architecture of the Mayas, who didn't use gold as a means for the economy but solely as a gift to their gods. The golden temple made of trash is, therefore, not a praise of the economy but, to the contrary, a praise of spiritual growth.</p>

Moreover, these creatures resemble hybrid monsters one can find in the myths and legends around the world.

We escape repetitive patterns and join the Gods in their playful dance. These acts are as simple and majestic as dirt: the very stuff of life from which possibilities bloom. The point is Life. Let 'it' happen, be it a step, a prose, a garden, a construct; build it!  Align with the waves as they arrive: birth, dance, art, sex, laughter, death. Wait, they will come.  Be taken, fully, all layers of your being surrendered. Each crisp frame arriving, engaged with hands, belly, body, environment.When we flow, the poles of our stories resolve; the wreckage of internal contradictions become the earth for our flowers. These ingredients are here, right now, and nothing is missing that would make you more complete. You are 'it', a complete and perfect being of Light.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

The people we serve are better able to handle the legal and business aspects of their careers as artists.

<h3>Miles to Go</h3>
<p>The title for this campaign is based on the Robert Frost poem <i>Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening. </i>This is the last stanza:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533138413/yndsdkkf3bkngsxxstd6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's a classic poem and most kids in the US study this poem at some point in school. It's about obligations, responsibilities, and completing work before relaxing and ""calling it a day"". I will literally have many, many, many miles to go. It will be challenging work, but the reward is that there will be so much beauty (photos, paintings, recordings) to show for it.</p>
<p>I am a professional artist as well as an avid cyclist. I love the various challenges of both.  When I first began to think of this expedition, I was watching the Tour de France and I was mostly interested in simply getting out of Philadelphia but I quickly realized that what I was really anticipating was hearing sounds in isolation. I love solitude and what I really wanted was to<i> </i>listen to those open spaces between me and Marfa, TX. I want to make new work about those sounds and all that space. Most of my art work to date has been paintings, sculptures and site-specific works. Recently, most of my paintings have used aerial photography as a starting point. Sound work is a new genre for me but I welcome the challenge here, too.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533321816/hcc82weekwz8bpox9zeq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'll use the photos and sketches as source materials for paintings, prints, and so on, but I'm most excited about creating a sound pieces and soundscapes from the best of the ambient sounds that I record. Though those sounds will be of particular places (rivers, open road, isolated city sounds, the sound of flocks of birds migrating, or the sound of rain on dry land), I want to make these sounds even more evocative for the listener by adding images and brief narratives about the sounds. My plan is to take aerial photos of each of the locations where I document sounds in order to achieve the balance between specificity and open-endedness that I'm looking for. Essentially, I want to evoke specific places while also leaving the viewer/listener room for their own interpretation.</p>

<h3>Why Marfa?</h3>
<p>Marfa is a vibrant little arts town out in the middle of nowhere, down close to the border of Texas and Mexico. One of my closest friends lives there so it's an ideal destination for a project that is based on distance, isolation and solitude. I've never been there and I'm so excited about this as my destination.</p>

<h3>Logistics</h3>
<p>This trip is slightly more than 2200 miles from Philadelphia to Marfa. My goal is to bike 80-100 miles each day. Currently, I cycle 25-30 miles a day, so committing to one month of longer rides is not too far fetched for me. I'm planning on making this trip alone in September because the weather is relatively mild then. It's also my birthday month and this seems like the very best way to celebrate life and big, big horizons.</p>
<p>I will not be camping, but staying in roadside motels. I will fly back to Philadelphia at the end of the trip. I have made arrangements for friends to send ""drops"" of supplies to a few locations along the way, which will limit the weight and amount of supplies that I'll have to pack on my bike.</p>
<p>I have a Surly Long Haul Trucker bike that I bought specifically for this trip. I'll have 2+ panniers on the bike. For the record, I've named my bike Sally Ride, in honor of the first female astronaut from the US.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533326665/hfz5lqtkrwjd2girmu4c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What I'll Be Doing</h3>
<p>I'm biking 2200+ miles by myself, which is a big feat on it's own. Along the way, I'll be documenting the trip through photos (by land and by drone), sketches and sound recordings. This documentation will be used in completed paintings, prints and a ""white noise"" piece that will utilize 10+ of my favorite sounds from the trip along with images and accompanying text. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533326384/r4ioen5hoshezkm1hrxj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Where the money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2100- travel expenses (motels along the way. This is calculated at $70/night x 30 nights. I am not attempting to stay in 4-star hotels, nor am I interested in camping. $70 is budget motel rate).</li>
<li>$950- equipment for the trip (drone, recording equipment, rain gear, emergency gear, solar charger)</li>
<li>$600-food and miscellaneous expenses.</li>
<li>$450- return flight (I don't want to ride back...)</li>
<li>$1600- production costs (printing, t-shirts, water bottles, wristbands, programming).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additional funds raised during this campaign will go towards creating a ""white noise"" app that would incorporate longer sound recordings from this trip along with the corresponding visuals and citations about where, when and why I chose those sounds.</p>
<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
<p>Obviously, you'll get my gratitude but I've put together what I think is a great array of awesomeness that suits budgets of any size. I'll also keep everyone updated on the blog and social media so you can keep track of my training, prep, challenges and thrills along the way.</p>
<p>The perks range from screensavers and ringtones to limited prints and original artwork.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This is Important</h3>
<p>Well, in short, I think it's important to do ""crazy"" things at times. It's easy to get complacent in life and I want to make sure that I keep challenging myself physically and artistically. I believe strongly that my work is important and should be supported widely. Below is a small selection of my work:</p>

<p>Typically, fundraising efforts articulate the What, Who, Why of a project. Yet this project is not common, so these questions will be addressed in uncommon fashion.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> Financial support is needed in the amount of $999  to complete a visual-linguistic contribution to the neural network of humankind. This creative expression is comprised of some hundred-twenty existing slides that need to be converted into another format and made freely available online.</p>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong> This is an uncredited project. It is neither created nor offered to call attention to the one through whom the work comes into being. </p>
<p><strong>WHY:</strong> Creativity is the wisdom-display of intelligence. Why is anything created; why is any articulation expressed? Are those who produce street art non-contributive? Acknowledging what is cannot be reduced to a business objective. Just as the impetus for this fundraise is derived from a so-called vision quest, the initiative for this project is derived from stillness.  The arrow knows not the purpose or target of its flight. </p>
<p>While artist/author and audience are equally unspecified, what can be clarified is that prior to a “theft” of some 4,500 dollars, funding for the completion of the project was in hand. This inconvenience renders one as vulnerable as to beg on the streets to make ends meet. Such vulnerability appreciates kindness.</p>
<p>False promises and hopes are easily sold in a world turned toward megalomania and shopping malls. The return offered here is that once the project is completed (spring 2019), funders will receive a link to the online project, in addition to deep gratitude. </p>

</div></div>","Typically, fundraising efforts articulate the What, Who, Why of a project. Yet this project is not common, so these questions will be addressed in uncommon fashion.
WHAT: Financial support is needed in the amount of $999  to complete a visual-linguistic contribution to the neural network of humankind. This creative expression is comprised of some hundred-twenty existing slides that need to be converted into another format and made freely available online.
WHO: This is an uncredited project. It is neither created nor offered to call attention to the one through whom the work comes into being. 
WHY: Creativity is the wisdom-display of intelligence. Why is anything created; why is any articulation expressed? Are those who produce street art non-contributive? Acknowledging what is cannot be reduced to a business objective. Just as the impetus for this fundraise is derived from a so-called vision quest, the initiative for this project is derived from stillness.  The arrow knows not the purpose or target of its flight. 
While artist/author and audience are equally unspecified, what can be clarified is that prior to a “theft” of some 4,500 dollars, funding for the completion of the project was in hand. This inconvenience renders one as vulnerable as to beg on the streets to make ends meet. Such vulnerability appreciates kindness.
False promises and hopes are easily sold in a world turned toward megalomania and shopping malls. The return offered here is that once the project is completed (spring 2019), funders will receive a link to the online project, in addition to deep gratitude. 
The first few slides are shared below. With appreciation and comp-passion, - c",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

It was the realisation of a life-long ambition to work in a culinary, people-led environment. Year on year for the last four years, business has more than doubled, and he and his team have built great reputation in a vibrant community that includes the European American Express Headquarters, Brighton University, the Law Courts and many local residents. </p><p><i>""For over thirty years I was lucky to work at a very high level within the international world of documentary and reportage photography, starting my career with Magnum Photos in London as part of Neil Burgess' team in the mid 80s. I was then given the opportunity by Geoff Katz to start a new specialist photo-agency, which we named Independent Photographers Group. Through the remarkable work of such photographers as Tom Stoddart, David Modell, Alastair Thain and Zed Nelson, to name but a few, the IPG name became synonymous with photography of the highest quality, with work by our photographers dominating the most important international awards for close to a decade. Both in these jobs and later as course director for the MA Photojournalism &amp; Documentary Photography at London College of Communication, I saw my role as one in which I helped photographers to reach their potential. In particular during my time at LCC, it was incredibly rewarding for me to see the improvement in students work after we had worked together, and more rewarding still to have followed the careers and growth of so many of these talented individuals.</i></p><p><i>I have found genuine happiness and contentment in my new life but also realise that I still have a lot to offer photographers who want to improve and evolve. At Speakers Corner, I will combine the old with the new by introducing a series of lectures, discussions and folio sessions designed to help photographers develop and see the world and the human condition more acutely. I also plan to start a series of public (rather than purely photographers) talks and assignment briefings, designed to help people learn to look at the world around them with a more critical eye.  </i></p><p><i>It's really exciting to be planning future in which my past and my present interests converge.""</i></p><p><strong>Natasha Thoday: Sound.</strong> </p><p>Natasha began designing and building vacuum tube electronic amplifier and horn loaded loudspeakers in the 1990s, following a life long passion for music and audio equipment. Whilst working as an audio retail consultant, she researched analogue acoustic science and technology history, going on to build a number of bespoke or prototype horn loudspeakers, tube amplifiers and record players. For example, she project managed the redesign and hand assembly of CNC manufactured parts for the Audio Note Japan Io phono cartridge, a high end global distributed model for vinyl L.P. record replay. She has also designed, prototyped, batch produced and sold a novel patented tone arm for replaying vinyl L.P.'s using a spring rather than the usual counterweight.</p><p><strong>Patrick Turner-Lee: Artistic advisor</strong></p><p>Fine artist, poet and musician, Patrick Turner-Lee has been instrumental in helping John transform his previous business, The Verdict Cafe, from a ‘one trick pony’ Jazz venue into one that has become relevant and respected within many new fields of art and performance.  </p><p><i>“ One of the most frustrating things I have discovered about living in Brighton is the chronic shortage of venues where like-minded creative people can meet to discus their ideas and have their project needs supported.

<h3>My campaign:</h3>
<p>My name is Laura Thoms and I am a letterpress printer, formerly of Austin, TX, now living at the McDonald Observatory, an astronomical observatory in very remote West Texas. In Dec 2018, I got a superbacteria that resulted in hospitalization out here and repeated trips to Austin (440 mi away) for treatment. On the way home from the hospital out here, my car broke down and in Jan 2019 I had to buy a new car. All in all, I am so grateful that I did not die (my blood pressure was at the passing out level from pain when I drove myself 50 miles to the hospital) but as the bills keep coming in, and I am not in a region where it is easy for me to take on extra work, I decided to create an online fundraiser to catch up on the financial suckhole that is my life right now. Currently I have been canceling all extraneous purchases, travel and obligations, and have come to the conclusion that extreme paucity is no way to live and financial stress is hugely detrimental to the creative projects I have lined up for 2019.  I am not entirely comfortable with a straight up gofundme for my medical bills --- so I created some thank you gifts/rewards, for your kindness, and to inspire donations. </p>
<ul>
<li>$10 gifts get a postcard; 2 for $20 all 4 for $40. I made some postcards of some of my favorite photos of animals you love like Harry &amp; Lily, and of west Texas. They turned out great, and this test run will be the inspiration for more if they sell out.</li>
<li>$20 letterpress print. My wonderful former colleague used to listen to an Italian language lesson at work. For weeks it said ""there is a fly in my wine glass"" which is now the only thing I can say in Italian. I had an illustrator friend make the drawing and printed it letterpress. This is the perfect silly addition to any kitchen or summer patio.</li>
<li>$45 artist proof of Lily. I have started to make solar plate prints of my photos of Lily. I love the process and cannot wait to do more. You can be the first to get the limited run of the very first edition printed on Rives cotton paper.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The details:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am hoping to raise $3000 to pay off my medical bills and catch up on other bills that have fallen behind</li>
<li>You can mix and match the reward levels if you want more than one thing.</li>

</div><p> </p></div>","My campaign:
My name is Laura Thoms and I am a letterpress printer, formerly of Austin, TX, now living at the McDonald Observatory, an astronomical observatory in very remote West Texas. In Dec 2018, I got a superbacteria that resulted in hospitalization out here and repeated trips to Austin (440 mi away) for treatment. On the way home from the hospital out here, my car broke down and in Jan 2019 I had to buy a new car. All in all, I am so grateful that I did not die (my blood pressure was at the passing out level from pain when I drove myself 50 miles to the hospital) but as the bills keep coming in, and I am not in a region where it is easy for me to take on extra work, I decided to create an online fundraiser to catch up on the financial suckhole that is my life right now. Currently I have been canceling all extraneous purchases, travel and obligations, and have come to the conclusion that extreme paucity is no way to live and financial stress is hugely detrimental to the creative projects I have lined up for 2019.  I am not entirely comfortable with a straight up gofundme for my medical bills --- so I created some thank you gifts/rewards, for your kindness, and to inspire donations. 

$10 gifts get a postcard; 2 for $20 all 4 for $40. I made some postcards of some of my favorite photos of animals you love like Harry & Lily, and of west Texas. They turned out great, and this test run will be the inspiration for more if they sell out.
$20 letterpress print. My wonderful former colleague used to listen to an Italian language lesson at work. For weeks it said ""there is a fly in my wine glass"" which is now the only thing I can say in Italian. I had an illustrator friend make the drawing and printed it letterpress. This is the perfect silly addition to any kitchen or summer patio.
$45 artist proof of Lily. I have started to make solar plate prints of my photos of Lily. I love the process and cannot wait to do more. You can be the first to get the limited run of the very first edition printed on Rives cotton paper.

What I Need & What You Get

The details:

I am hoping to raise $3000 to pay off my medical bills and catch up on other bills that have fallen behind
You can mix and match the reward levels if you want more than one thing.
You can donate at a greater level and get a reward. If you want to donate $100 and only get 2 postcards that is fine. We are all Marie Kondo-ing our worlds, so you may not need more stuff. I just want a way to tangibly say ""thank you."" 
Everything is already made -- so the day you donate, your reward will be on its way to you.
All funds donated will help me catch up, even if I do not reach my $3000 goal.


The Impact
Your contribution will make a huge difference:
I am launching my first printing non profit in the next month, and being free from this financial burden will allow me to focus more fully on this exciting project.

As Asians in America, identity is ever-evolving and ever-changing. Identity is ethereal. To understand ourselves, we seek, we grasp, consciously and unconsciously, and channel our energy into understanding what it means to be human and to be Asian American.<br/><br/><strong>The Reason</strong><br/><br/>In the hopes of documenting a facet of Asian American progress, we’re taking a snapshot of where we are today by hosting a multi-medium pop-up art exhibit. The exhibition will feature art from up and coming Asian American artists within the NYC Metropolitan area. We want it to a gathering filled with visual arts, live performances, short film screenings and food. This two-day exhibit will be a celebration of what the Asian American creative community has to offer. The two-day event will be held in the heart of Greenwich Village August 11th to 12th, 2018. <br/><br/>When we think of Asian Americans, the arts and creative fields are not the first things that come to mind. We want to help change this perception. We know first hand that there are an incredible amount of artists out there who identify as Asian American and are doing amazing work but are not yet seen or widely known. So we want to be a part of the process of making these artists visible. We also want to help build up a community in order to foster a stronger identity as Asian American creatives. That is why we are making this event multi-medium. By housing many different art forms under the same roof, we will be able to see just how wide the community of Asian American creatives is and hopefully inspire others to get creative as well. We also wish to tackle the meaning of “Asian American” and ask if the term is too limiting to the wide variety of people who identify as such. We hope to let the artists and their work speak for themselves. Many of them have wrestled with their heritage, identity, gender and have explored that on their canvas of choice. But we also recognize that artists belonging to minority groups are more than just their skin color, heritage, or gender identity and should not be limited to only exploring these topics in their artwork. Our hope in creating this event is to make Ethereal an open platform for the artists to voice their message.<br/><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p></div><div>
<p>We want this event to be the best possible and to make it accessible for all people to come. That’s why, from the beginning, we were determined to make this event non-ticketed and open to the public. But in order to put on the event the way we envisioned it, and to give the artists the platform they deserve, we need your help.<br/><br/>As for what the funds will be used for - all of the funds from this event will be used to cover the cost of the venue. The venue is located in-between NYU campus, West 4th street station, and Union Square. We chose this venue because we wanted ease of accessibility and ample visibility. To be honest, our total event budget is $15,000. If your beautiful contributions exceed the amount of $10,000, we will be using them to further cover the cost of the event. This includes building the stage, equipment rental for food, and music. We will also be allocating funds to prepare for the next event as well as giving honorariums to our artists. <br/><br/>• $12,500 for the venue itself for three days, August 10th-12th. This is for the venue alone.<br/>Additional funds will be used to cover:<br/>• Venue insurance<br/>• DJ equipment, barista equipment<br/>• Tables, chairs, van rentals<br/>• Cost of building a stage<br/>• Installation Manager fee<br/>• Merchandise<br/><br/>Located in the heart of Greenwich Village and bordering West Village, our venue is centrally located on 8th street, between 5th and 6th avenue.

<p>Az Azure Reformművészeti Találkozó a Kék Ló csapatának szervezésében megvalósuló rendezvény. Ennek célja, hogy az egyre bővülő, de elsősorban Budapesthez kötődő közösségi-kulturális tér értékeit egy barátságos zalai tanya és egy szomszédos gyönyörű völgy környezetével és embereivel kapcsolatba hozzuk. A kísérleti művészetek, a szabadzene és a kockázatos gondolkodás hirdetésén túl fontos tehát számunkra a meglévő hálózatok (mind az alkotók, mind az alkotások hálózatának) folyamatos újra-formálása – ezt jelentené az elnevezésben a „reformművészet” megjelölés.

<p>The Azure Reform Arts Gathering is organised by the crew of Kék ló.

Besides the introduction and spreading of experimental arts, innovative music, free and risky thinking, it has utmost importance for us to constantly re-form the already existing networks (both the network of artists and their works). Therefore we named the festival Reform Art Gathering as we intend to ""re-form"" art itself. Hence we expose avant-garde jazz music, local food, contemporary short films, surreal costumes and much more all together at Zalaháshágy, July 5-8. For our plans, it was a great inspiration to collaborate with festivals such as UbikEklektik or Takatuka.</p>

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>Hello! I’m Yannis, co-founder of animation company NOMINT, based in London, and for the past five months I have been working with some of the best animators and animation directors I know to bring you the <strong>World’s First Animated COVID Mask</strong>, in support of the children's hospital GOSH, just on time for this year's Giving Tuesday.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, watch the video at the top of this page, which will hopefully make everything clear. I am selling all 400 of the masks used in the video to support the Great Ormond Street Hospital.</p>
<p>In the light of the whirlwind of events that are happening in the world, I hope the masks with their vibrant and whimsical designs will instill hope and positivity, while helping the most vulnerable among us. </p>

<br/><br/>Two years ago I quit my day job to focus full-time on my art career.

Thank you all for viewing my campaign. An international artist (Australian born with Chilean family origin) working from my studio apartment located in San Francisco, California. I am a dream-time painter; painting a positive idea of reality into the future and need your help to create more art, be a lot more involved in community projects, network and share with the world.
Skilled in digital and traditional arts mostly painting, illustration and graphics, I also have experience with sculpture and hand sewn crafts. The main purpose of my art is: universal healing, spiritual cleansing and positive strengthening of each individual soul as well as the community.  Depicting connections of the spiritual and physical realms, the ancient combined with the modern, creating images of beauty with intense colors and sharp line-work which I intend to bring feelings of strength, joy, inspiration and upliftment to people of all ages and origins of earth.
Two years ago I quit my day job to focus full-time on my art career. Have been surviving on a minimal budget, selling fine art, taking commissions and graphics services to those mostly independent businesses in my immediate community network. Extreme Inflation in the price of living and some of my equipment going out of commission has stunted my career and ability to be involved in community projects. Right now I really need a financial boost to fully focus on my fine art, produce more powerful dream-time paintings & designs, contribute as much as possible to the SF arts and cultural community, network and share what's happening with the world.Everyone who donates to this fundraiser will be cherished for eternity as one of the people who helped me advance on solid ground.
PERKS!CHECK FOR UPDATES TO SEE PERKS BEING CREATEDAnyone who donates and has a website where you share your talents, I will love to post your link on my blog and share on my social networks.Donations of $5 or more will get you something tangible from me in the mail.Supporters of $20 or more will receive some form of my original fine art work or hand-made craft.Very small works and hand-made crafts are rarely ever seen online as they are usually sold in person shortly after they are made. For those interested in owning original paintings, you will be getting FIRST DIBS ON NEW WORK!To protect your investments acrylic paintings are all done with UV and Waterproof paint.These Voodoo Dolls are available in $80 and $1000 perk reward packages.
If you want two of the same type of item or more than one different perk indiegogo lets you donate as many times as you want and choose your perk as quantities allow.Those who donate twice at $20 or more will get a free bonus gift.Creation of most rewards including thank you art and color page will be created during and after this fundraiser with all my supporters in mind. As funds become available completion and fulfillment of rewards will become my number one priority. Contributions through pay-pal will definitely help a lot to speed up the process of sending out perks.Am very excited to share my artworks with you.The highest perk package for one extremely generous supporter of $2000, includes one custom made graphic for use in your independent business endeavors with all rights going toward your business. This works great for those who not only want to invest in and support my original art creations but also need a beautiful and professional custom graphic or illustration to use in their own commercial endeavors. That person will also receive an original painting of mine to have in their home or office.
To make sure everyone receives their perks, those who donate please include your email and for those who's rewards need to be shipped please include your shipping address as well. I look forward to sending them to you.FREE PERK!!! for $0.00 take a moment to share my campaign with your network, I will definitely return your kindness by giving thanks and sharing your endeavors as well. If money is raised due to your networking be prepared to receive a free perk!!!! (size and value depends on amounts raised)ANY AMOUNT of money raised regardless of set goal, will go a long way in helping me pay my bills and keep making art work on a full-time basis. It will be used first for the fulfillment of all perk packages, basic living expenses, much needed art tools, basic equipment and supplies. Reaching the goal would secure me 3 months of time to create art, it will also enable me to create simple marketing material, expand my professional network, do more art shows, participate in and promote more artists as well as community art projects and cultural events. Also will give me a small but adequate budget to hire a local photographer to take some good quality images of larger size paintings and more intricate hand-sewn crafts. (As you can see these pictures below taken by me are not very good at all)

</p><p><b>What is Gallery Aferro? What’s the big
excitement?</b></p>
<p>Gallery Aferro is a Newark-based alternative
arts space founded in 2003 by artists Evonne M. Davis and Emma Wilcox. We dream <i>big: </i>in 2014, we began an ambitious project to renovate two
additional buildings adjacent to our current space into a single <i><b>90,000 sq ft
cultural center</b></i>, allowing us to have an even bigger, richer, and more lasting
impact for our wonderful community. We
believe in sharing ideas, sharing resources, and that everyone, every single
person, should be able to have the arts in their lives and feel welcome at our space.
Over the past 11 years, we've worked with hundreds of artists, welcomed thousands of visitors, and become an important part of our community. <br/></p><p>The critical mass of many artists under one roof, and the consortium model we've created with our numerous partners and collaborators means that the project will be a beloved, iconic destination for youth, artists, families, and in short, everyone. The project includes numerous components: 60 artist studios, workshop/lab spaces for specific media like 
printmaking and commercial photo studio with a co-op, membership model, 
presenting spaces for visual arts and film, purpose-built educational 
space, fun retail like a cafe and an enlarged gift shop, and ""flux 
spaces,"" designated in response to strong community demand for flexible 
spaces that can be used for conferencing, hackathons, skillshare 
sessions, yoga and dance classes, staged readings and poetry slams, etc.
 <br/></p><p>We have almost everything we need to make
that happen- but we’re asking for your support for the remaining funding to open in 2015.
</p><p><b>We work very hard and do lots of cool stuff:</b></p>
<p>We are a DIY kind of place: we do all building
repairs, hang the shows, locate and use recycled and donated materials, and work
with a large group of community volunteers, including both of our moms. In
2006, the gallery was able to move into a donated 20,000 sq ft building right
here in the heart of downtown Newark. Since then, we’ve steadily and rapidly
developed all of the programs that we offer for residents of Newark and the
greater region:</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Our
ambitious annual roster of 12-15 on-and off-site exhibitions, of local,
national and international artists, in every contemporary media, FREE to see</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>A
wide range of FREE public events such as artist talks, workshops, performances,
panels, and screenings</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Our
year-round artist residency program, connecting artists who have ranged in age
from 19 to 60+ with large studios, resources, and community</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Educational
offerings such as FREE tours for school/adult groups and our FREE arts/STEM
intensive for Newark’s high school age women </p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Our
new public art initiative, Activate: Market Street, bringing installation, new
media and interactive art to multiple vacant storefronts on our block 24/7</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Aferro
Publications, consisting of more than 20 artist books, exhibition catalogs,
essays, and a sound art CD, to date.</p><p>We have an excellent track record of collaboration with dozens of other galleries, museums, schools, grassroots collectives, social service orgs,and others. We are as comfortable working with a large museum as we are rigging up a projector to run off a car battery and sharing art in a vacant lot! We have been honored with 3 consecutive citations of excellence from the NJ state arts council, as well as with the ongoing everyday recognition of the numerous people who make us a part of their lives. <br/></p>
<p><b>We are working harder, dreaming bigger, and doing more
cool stuff for and with more people:</b></p>
<p>We seek to seize the opportunity presented by the
vacant buildings, and contribute to positive momentum in Newark. We know we can serve our most vulnerable neighbors, as well as create a wonderful iconic
destination that people from outside the area will want to visit! We want to create a positive model that can be leveraged to ensure that the arts stay accessible and centrally located as the city changes. Newark has an incredible history of cultural activity up to the present, but many residents still face numerous challenges. We want to be the the biggest and the best organization we can be to serve our community.<br/></p>
<p><b>What we have:</b> $50,000 in funds raised from
individuals and foundation, $100,000+ in donated in-kind labor from
contractors, architects, and community volunteers, and of course, the 70,000 sq
ft in additional donated space from RBH Group. <b>What we need</b>: your support to cover the remaining funding gap
in our budget for electrical upgrades, restroom renovation for
wheelchair-accessible facilities, and fire safety needs, mainly new emergency
doors and lighting/signage. The fact that we have been able to raise almost all
of the funding and support to make the project happen speaks to the community
desire for the expansion to open. We have always taken accountability and
transparency seriously: we will keep everyone updated on what we’re doing and
how we’re doing, and answer questions!</p>
<p><b>Yay perks!</b> As you can see, we’ve got some awesome perks to
thank you for your support. We commissioned
Aferro-affiliated artists Jerry Gant, Wendy Letven, Fausto Sevilla, Elizabeth
Storm and Joe Waks to create limited edition posters, lovingly printed to a
high standard by family-owned local printer Remco Press. We were founded in
Newark, we love doing what we do in Newark, and we want each of you who donates
to feel that excitement. The posters and other perk items reflect our time and
place, this moment of incredible possibility here in NJ’s largest city, the one
and only Newark NJ.
</p><p><b>How you can help:</b> Donate here and now. Share the campaign online. Tell somebody about it. Tell everybody about it. Get coworkers or friends together to go in on a big perk and have a great private party! Write an article about the project. Get excited for 2015!<br/></p><p>From all of us, thank you so very much for your interest, we hope you will check out our links, pictures, and get involved. We want to thank MEDINA=CITI our incredible neighbors who produced and edited our video, and our wonderful friends who appear in it.  #newarknj #aferroexpansion #galleryaferro #indiegogoperks<br/></p></div>","What is Gallery Aferro?

essays, and a sound art CD, to date.We have an excellent track record of collaboration with dozens of other galleries, museums, schools, grassroots collectives, social service orgs,and others. We are as comfortable working with a large museum as we are rigging up a projector to run off a car battery and sharing art in a vacant lot! We have been honored with 3 consecutive citations of excellence from the NJ state arts council, as well as with the ongoing everyday recognition of the numerous people who make us a part of their lives. 
We are working harder, dreaming bigger, and doing more
cool stuff for and with more people:
We seek to seize the opportunity presented by the
vacant buildings, and contribute to positive momentum in Newark. We know we can serve our most vulnerable neighbors, as well as create a wonderful iconic
destination that people from outside the area will want to visit! We want to create a positive model that can be leveraged to ensure that the arts stay accessible and centrally located as the city changes. Newark has an incredible history of cultural activity up to the present, but many residents still face numerous challenges. We want to be the the biggest and the best organization we can be to serve our community.
What we have: $50,000 in funds raised from
individuals and foundation, $100,000+ in donated in-kind labor from
contractors, architects, and community volunteers, and of course, the 70,000 sq
ft in additional donated space from RBH Group. What we need: your support to cover the remaining funding gap
in our budget for electrical upgrades, restroom renovation for
wheelchair-accessible facilities, and fire safety needs, mainly new emergency
doors and lighting/signage. The fact that we have been able to raise almost all
of the funding and support to make the project happen speaks to the community
desire for the expansion to open. We have always taken accountability and
transparency seriously: we will keep everyone updated on what we’re doing and
how we’re doing, and answer questions!
Yay perks! As you can see, we’ve got some awesome perks to
thank you for your support. We commissioned
Aferro-affiliated artists Jerry Gant, Wendy Letven, Fausto Sevilla, Elizabeth
Storm and Joe Waks to create limited edition posters, lovingly printed to a
high standard by family-owned local printer Remco Press. We were founded in
Newark, we love doing what we do in Newark, and we want each of you who donates
to feel that excitement. The posters and other perk items reflect our time and
place, this moment of incredible possibility here in NJ’s largest city, the one
and only Newark NJ.
How you can help: Donate here and now. Share the campaign online. Tell somebody about it. Tell everybody about it. Get coworkers or friends together to go in on a big perk and have a great private party! Write an article about the project. Get excited for 2015!From all of us, thank you so very much for your interest, we hope you will check out our links, pictures, and get involved. We want to thank MEDINA=CITI our incredible neighbors who produced and edited our video, and our wonderful friends who appear in it.  #newarknj #aferroexpansion #galleryaferro #indiegogoperks",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Hi!  Britten Traughber here, also known as the Notorious BLT or Lady Bea Touble... for those of you who don't know me I'm an  artist/photographer/professor based in Normal IL. Recently I moved from the Big Island of Hawaii in order to continue teaching, while my husband Bert finishes his PhD research in Hawaii.   Hawaii was an adventure and challenge beyond what anyone could have prepared me for. I met so many great people, and one of my greatest joys of Island life was creating artwork showing the diversity and challenges of island life. I also got to experience being broke beyond broke- overeducated and underemployed- and living in a colonized land that should still be it's own country- hooray for the USA! </span></h3>
<p>One of many adventures in Hawaii, I had an opportunity to buy an Epson 7900 printer for a fraction of the normal cost. It was brand new, never opened, and worked like a charm after a little island-maintenance and TLC. I used it for a little over a year, printing images for friends, clients, the local theatre company, and many others. The joy of being able to make my own prints  again was immense, and completed the cycle of my personal practice as an artist. </p>
<p>Now the time has come, after 4 years on the island and 6 months of living apart, for Bert to join me in Illinois! While we have been trying to manage the logistics of moving him back to the mainland, paying for 2 households, working 4 jobs, etc...  the ONE unanswered question has remained- What do you do with a 200 lb professional printer? We have tried to find a buyer on island, with no luck. And to be honest, the cost of shipping it still makes the investment an absolute steal. The worst case scenario is that we find no buyer, do not ship it, and it is left behind or put into storage. I am trying my hardest to avoid losing such a key piece of equipment! </p>
<p>So... Instead of asking for donations (everyone needs donations, right? LOL) I am asking you to help me invest in my studio practice by BUYING MY ART. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>Bert has researched the cheapest methods of shipping the printer, and around $900 is the lowest we have been able to find from Hilo to Illinois. We spent a bit to build a sturdy crate, and the printer has been packed beautifully. Once sent, it will travel via ship and arrive in 8-12 weeks.</li>
<li>If we do not reach the whole goal, that's ok! Any amount raised will be put towards the shipping cost... Leaving it behind is not an option anymore! If we raise more, it will be applied towards the other expenses of getting Bert (and our pets) back to the Mainland. Worst case, I can leave the printer, but not my husband and cats. </li> <li>What do you get? YOU GET AWESOME ART! YOU CAN GIVE AWESOME ART FOR THE HOLIDAYS!

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Why is this important? </h3>
<div>In the grand scheme of things it's not. It's just stuff. You can't take it with you, right? I left a lot of material things to move to Hawaii, and I left a lot of material things there. But this is much more important than just a ""thing"". This is art!  </div>
<div>Those of you who know me, and follow my work, know I am a hardworking and resilient broad. My art is everything to me, and I am constantly working towards a more sustainable and successful professional practice. The sacrifices and challenges of living in Hawaii are going to take a while to counterbalance both personally and professionally, and being able to continue my own printing will be a key element to this transition. I have exhibits already booked for May and June in Illinois, and this is just the beginning of a new active presence in the world of photography. </div>
<div>While most photographers do not own their own large scale printers, I bought it at such  low price that it just made sense to own one.

<h1><b>Short Description</b></h1>
</div>I called my book Lark's Enchanted World because I love to live in the world where miracles are a reality. With your help this book will be printed and traverse the world so more people will believe in miracles and live in peace with each other. <br/><br/>It is a hardcover book with 62 complementary paintings and poems. I write and paint directly from my heart and each of my poems found a soulmate in one of my paintings.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467570490/2-Lark_Pilinsky-with-Art_dnilzw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h1><b><h1><b>Why Is Lark's Enchanted World Important?</b></h1></b></h1><p>I was delighted and then inspired to learn recently that science now recognizes what artists have long known: That art can be as powerful as love.</p><p>Case in point: Semir Zeki, Professor of Neuroaesthetics at University College London, found that blood flow to the brain “increased when looking at a beautiful painting just as it increases when you look at somebody you love. This tells us that art induces a feel-good sensation directly to the brain.""</p><p>In non-scientific terms, Dr. Zeki is saying that the process of observing art connects those who observe with the artists, their art and their moments of inspiration. And like all artists, I want to share with you, through my art, the love that art can induce, and the healing it can bring.</p><p>I want readers to enjoy and share the love that art brings me. My creation process is very important in it: I meditate and allow my intuition to guide me. This helps me release stress, connect to my higher self and dive into <span>a more pure consciousness</span>. I believe my book will help readers experience the same elevated soul state.<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468401035/5._Two_candles_in_a_flame_300_nffpfl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1><b>The Vision</b></h1><p>When I realized that there was healing energy in my poetry and paintings, I resolved to present them together to enhance and strengthen their impact. The latest result of these magic explorations is ""Lark’s Enchanted World"". It evokes the wild, beautiful surroundings where I grew up in rural Ukraine and the passionate beauty of nature of California, where I live now. <br/></p><h1><b>Who Am I?</b></h1><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467357814/Lark_with_Art_May_2016crop1_o93ff2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote><i>“I am rarely a “fan” of any artist, but Lark aka Larisa Pilinsky is an exceptional phenomenon. Besides her brilliant sense of composition, she is the ultimate “green artist” or maybe she is also the grand ‘love child’ of Kandinsky and Schwitters, but regardless I find Lark’s talent is built on the ‘shoulders’ of masters of the 20th century.” </i></blockquote><div>                 
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Tony Clark, Chévalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, <br/>                  American Association Of Museum Directors Board Member.</span><br/><br/>I call myself Lark, I was born Larisa Leibman, the daughter of a geologist and a language teacher. I grew up in the world of their explorations and dreams, surrounded by his semi-precious stones and sounds of my mother voice, singing songs in different languages and reading me Shakespeare sonnets. They taught me how to become one with nature and learn from her, so that now nature heals me whenever I feel physical or emotional pain. <br/><br/>Through this book I hope to share these knowledge with you. Many of my artistic clients say they find joy, peace and healing in my work. Here are the words of just one of them:<br/><blockquote>
“Lark, I lost my beloved husband of 54 years last Thanksgiving and your paintings give me such sublime peace. I love them. So happy to find your wonderful art that soothe me. Thank you Lark.""<br/><span style=""font-style: normal;background-color: initial;"">Linda Warwick Van Fossan<br/></span>

<h1>How You Can Help
</h1>
<p>Your contribution will
fund a limited, signed edition of beautiful art treasures . I will supervise the
quality of each volume before it is shipped, and inscribe it with a personal
note according your wishes. The cost of printing 300 copies will be $5,200. </p>
<p>Lark's Enchanted World will be just that: Enchanted! It will be a full color, 8.5"" x 11"" 124-page hardcover book which will consist of 62 paintings from my Conversations With Nature series and 62 of my poems from different periods which relate to each other.</p>

<p>The first half of the book, titled Love Flowers, explores love, loss, and hope through atmospheric landscapes. Poems accompany each painting to bring out my vision and feelings for each piece. The Kiss Of The Sky is the second half, here I reflect on miracles, nature’s power and our place within the world. Both are infused with love for nature and all that is divine within us. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463377252/kissofthesky_lefz9h.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 621.834px;height: 339px;""/></p>

<p>Your pledge will help
produce, print and ship 300 copies of my book, and spread the
healing power of nature through my work. The members of my team are my  husband, Laurence Vittes, who is the inspiration, the editor of this book and the love of my life. Ms. Arzu Tunca, publisher,  was instrumental in the creation of this book and the Indiegogo campaign. She has collected and assembled the entire book and when funds are available, she will print it. <br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Description
I called my book Lark's Enchanted World because I love to live in the world where miracles are a reality. With your help this book will be printed and traverse the world so more people will believe in miracles and live in peace with each other. It is a hardcover book with 62 complementary paintings and poems. I write and paint directly from my heart and each of my poems found a soulmate in one of my paintings.Why Is Lark's Enchanted World Important?I was delighted and then inspired to learn recently that science now recognizes what artists have long known: That art can be as powerful as love.Case in point: Semir Zeki, Professor of Neuroaesthetics at University College London, found that blood flow to the brain “increased when looking at a beautiful painting just as it increases when you look at somebody you love. This tells us that art induces a feel-good sensation directly to the brain.""In non-scientific terms, Dr. Zeki is saying that the process of observing art connects those who observe with the artists, their art and their moments of inspiration. And like all artists, I want to share with you, through my art, the love that art can induce, and the healing it can bring.I want readers to enjoy and share the love that art brings me. My creation process is very important in it: I meditate and allow my intuition to guide me. This helps me release stress, connect to my higher self and dive into a more pure consciousness. I believe my book will help readers experience the same elevated soul state.The VisionWhen I realized that there was healing energy in my poetry and paintings, I resolved to present them together to enhance and strengthen their impact. The latest result of these magic explorations is ""Lark’s Enchanted World"". It evokes the wild, beautiful surroundings where I grew up in rural Ukraine and the passionate beauty of nature of California, where I live now. Who Am I?“I am rarely a “fan” of any artist, but Lark aka Larisa Pilinsky is an exceptional phenomenon. Besides her brilliant sense of composition, she is the ultimate “green artist” or maybe she is also the grand ‘love child’ of Kandinsky and Schwitters, but regardless I find Lark’s talent is built on the ‘shoulders’ of masters of the 20th century.”                  
Tony Clark, Chévalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres,                   American Association Of Museum Directors Board Member.I call myself Lark, I was born Larisa Leibman, the daughter of a geologist and a language teacher. I grew up in the world of their explorations and dreams, surrounded by his semi-precious stones and sounds of my mother voice, singing songs in different languages and reading me Shakespeare sonnets. They taught me how to become one with nature and learn from her, so that now nature heals me whenever I feel physical or emotional pain. Through this book I hope to share these knowledge with you. Many of my artistic clients say they find joy, peace and healing in my work. Here are the words of just one of them:
“Lark, I lost my beloved husband of 54 years last Thanksgiving and your paintings give me such sublime peace. I love them. So happy to find your wonderful art that soothe me. Thank you Lark.""Linda Warwick Van Fossan



How You Can Help

Your contribution will
fund a limited, signed edition of beautiful art treasures . I will supervise the
quality of each volume before it is shipped, and inscribe it with a personal
note according your wishes. The cost of printing 300 copies will be $5,200. 
Lark's Enchanted World will be just that: Enchanted! It will be a full color, 8.5"" x 11"" 124-page hardcover book which will consist of 62 paintings from my Conversations With Nature series and 62 of my poems from different periods which relate to each other.

What Will Lark's Enchanted World Look Like 

The first half of the book, titled Love Flowers, explores love, loss, and hope through atmospheric landscapes. Poems accompany each painting to bring out my vision and feelings for each piece. The Kiss Of The Sky is the second half, here I reflect on miracles, nature’s power and our place within the world. Both are infused with love for nature and all that is divine within us. 
Where The Money Will Go
Your pledge will help
produce, print and ship 300 copies of my book, and spread the
healing power of nature through my work. The members of my team are my  husband, Laurence Vittes, who is the inspiration, the editor of this book and the love of my life. Ms. Arzu Tunca, publisher,  was instrumental in the creation of this book and the Indiegogo campaign. She has collected and assembled the entire book and when funds are available, she will print it.

She is one of several artists throughout the U.S. invited to teach other creative mediums including: <strong>Carren Clarke-Mcadoo (VA), Shurvon Haynes (WA), Jolyn E. Gardner (WA), Larry Poncho Brown (MD), Tommy Roberts (MD), Shawn Livers (MD), and Ethan Holland (PA)</strong>, to name a few. A noteworthy group of American artists exchanging creative education with African artists!</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT A2A:</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARTISTS 2 AFRICA</strong> was birthed from decades of artists discussing the prospect of organizing a group journey to Africa tailored specifically for artists and focused on art education. <strong>On October 19-30, 2013 we will embark on our second official journey to Ghana West Africa!</strong></p>
<p>The artists will journey into the art villages on the outskirts of Ghana. Various artisans including painters, sculptors, and weavers will be gathered in their workshops to create and collaborate. We will fellowship with the artists and students, visit their workshops to share technique, and explore the creative process, while exchanging our creative ideas with the artisans in the region. An exhibition will be organized featuring the works of each artist. <strong>Our focus is to educate and connect through ART.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL YOUR FUNDS BE UTILIZED?</strong></p>
<p>With your support we hope you will assist us with this unified effort. As you can see on the right...the artist has graciously donated her art for perks. The campaign is to assist us with acquiring art materials for other artists to use on our visit as we fellowship by creating art. We will be visiting 4 locations where ceramic, wood carving, fabric making and other artforms are taught and produced. We will introduce various art projects and will instruct several groups of artisans and other participants. Funds will assist with art supplies and materials, and small tools. We also plan to document this experience with photography and video as a future educational medium. We hope you will take advantage of this unique opportunity to assist with this project....thank you. <strong>Share.Teach.Create!</strong></p></div>","ABOUT THE ARTIST:

For more than 20 years, the Jewelry Center was part of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), offering classes to continuing studies and full-time students. When MICA announced in 2012 that it would discontinue the program due to budget constraints, we were of course very disappointed, but we also were determined and excited to keep this thriving, well-loved program alive as a community-based metals and jewelry makerspace. Our excitement increased as we realized that as an independent organization we could now offer more educational opportunities to a more diverse range of students. Additionally, we could expand our programming to provide facilities and support for practicing jewelry artists, and actively participate in Baltimore’s artist and maker community. We got down to work and the Baltimore Jewelry Center was formed! In June of 2014 we opened our doors and in August 2014 we received our official designation as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Since opening our doors, we have educated over 180 students! We are proud to be the only community-based metals and jewelry makerspace in the Baltimore region.</p><p>We are incredibly grateful for our loyal and supportive community of students and instructors, which continues to thrive and grow, and we want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to experience all that we have to offer.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431274759/zjcya4e1zvyz5732nugf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431274420/agaq0josbr1656bcgqxu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p><i>(Clockwise from top left) Instructor Beth Pohlman teaching forging to a beginning metals class, Globe necklace by Instructor April Wood, necklace by student and Board Member Mary Raivel, end of semester display of student work, silver ring made in the Ring in a Day workshop.<br/></i></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430871773/bwum6vbwgzswixaofwqp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>We need your help to support our growing community and goals!

Though our current building met our basic needs when we were part of MICA, its tucked away location is a bit hard to find, with no foot traffic and limited visibility. Our current space has no exhibition, office, or retail spaces, and its size limits us to holding one class at a time.

Our new space is bigger, and the building has high visibility, foot traffic, and a great location in the heart of the thriving Station North Arts and Entertainment District, a rapidly expanding arts district designated by the state of Maryland.

My name is Denise Collins, creator of the Mermaid Art Studio, along with my good friend and fellow Long Beach Artist, Laura Bykowski. I am a Long Beach resident (19 years) and Certified K-12 Art teacher (MS ArtEd./LIU/CWPost), teaching 10 years in the Long Beach School District. As an undergraduate, centuries ago, I majored in both Social Welfare and Art; wasn't sure if I wanted to save the world or paint it! Art kept beckoning me. I have studied at the Arts Students League, The School of Visual Arts in NYC, UMAss Art New England,  as well as privately in the Art Studio Of John F. Murray, a classically trained Figure and Portrait artist. I am always learning and taking workshops to this day. I have worked as a social worker, graphic artist, freelance illustrator and Art teacher. At this point in my life, I believe my greatest strength as an artist lies in my teaching, especially with children and young adults.I am extremely fortunate to have realized this opportunity...and to keep it growing and evolving!<br/><br/>A few summers ago Laura and I began teaching Art classes out of a small garage which was the beginning of The Mermaid Art Studio. The experience made me realize how vitally important it is for children to have a community based Art studio, in addition to school, where they can express themselves all year long. Hurricane Sandy only fortified my conviction that this was crucial. I see Art as being a necessary vehicle for community restoration and rebirth and happily, I live in a community that supports this belief and nurtures it in their children!<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Laura Bykowski</strong><br/>Hi, I'm Laura and I'm a preservation librarian, bookbinder, and a knitter who dyes and spins her own yarn. My vision of The Mermaid Art Studio is a place where folks can come to imagine, explore and express their creative spirit. In a world where so much is digital and virtual, it is deeply gratifying to create something tangible and completely unique.<br/><br/>In addition to entrepreneurial spirit and artistic vision, I bring over 20 years of start up/business experience and project management skills to the Mermaid Studio. I'm a graduate of The New School and CW Post/Palmer School. I'm also the co-founder of another Long Beach &amp; web-based business, <a href=""http://www.beachgirlspurls.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Beach Girls Purls"">Beach Girls Purls</a>.

Last October Long Beach suffered tremendous devastation in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. One school remains closed and the future of our hospital remains unclear. But the community is closer and stronger than ever. Evidence of our “Bruised but not Broken” attitude is everywhere—homeowners are lifting their houses and rebuilding smarter.

More about Denise and Laura
Denise Collins GilgannonHi! My name is Denise Collins, creator of the Mermaid Art Studio, along with my good friend and fellow Long Beach Artist, Laura Bykowski. I am a Long Beach resident (19 years) and Certified K-12 Art teacher (MS ArtEd./LIU/CWPost), teaching 10 years in the Long Beach School District. As an undergraduate, centuries ago, I majored in both Social Welfare and Art; wasn't sure if I wanted to save the world or paint it! Art kept beckoning me. I have studied at the Arts Students League, The School of Visual Arts in NYC, UMAss Art New England,  as well as privately in the Art Studio Of John F. Murray, a classically trained Figure and Portrait artist. I am always learning and taking workshops to this day. I have worked as a social worker, graphic artist, freelance illustrator and Art teacher. At this point in my life, I believe my greatest strength as an artist lies in my teaching, especially with children and young adults.I am extremely fortunate to have realized this opportunity...and to keep it growing and evolving!A few summers ago Laura and I began teaching Art classes out of a small garage which was the beginning of The Mermaid Art Studio. The experience made me realize how vitally important it is for children to have a community based Art studio, in addition to school, where they can express themselves all year long. Hurricane Sandy only fortified my conviction that this was crucial. I see Art as being a necessary vehicle for community restoration and rebirth and happily, I live in a community that supports this belief and nurtures it in their children!
Laura BykowskiHi, I'm Laura and I'm a preservation librarian, bookbinder, and a knitter who dyes and spins her own yarn. My vision of The Mermaid Art Studio is a place where folks can come to imagine, explore and express their creative spirit. In a world where so much is digital and virtual, it is deeply gratifying to create something tangible and completely unique.In addition to entrepreneurial spirit and artistic vision, I bring over 20 years of start up/business experience and project management skills to the Mermaid Studio. I'm a graduate of The New School and CW Post/Palmer School. I'm also the co-founder of another Long Beach & web-based business, Beach Girls Purls. My background is in project management and technology so between Denise and myself, we've got both the creative and business sides of the studio covered.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Can you imagine being a part of something that will be seen by millions of people and will still be here in 5000 years?  Help me complete this magnificent bronze sculpture.
 
Story
Sculpture for the Ages.
St. Michael the Archangel is one of the most popular images in all Christianity; the patron saint of soldiers, sailors, police officers and those who protect and keep us safe as well as more than 50 countries and cities around the world.
As an artist, the commission to produce a sculpture of St. Michael was a dream come true, to produce it in bronze at a heroic 15 feet and weighing more than 3 tons was a once in a lifetime opportunity.  And what better place for such a spectacular sculpture than the beautiful grounds of Mary, Queen of the Universe, the National Basilica located here in Orlando between the magical worlds of Disney and Universal Studios.  The Shrine attracts millions of visitors from every corner of the world with it’s magnificent grounds, architecture and collection of original art.
When completed and installed this September, the nine foot Michael with his twelve foot wings will stand guardian at the entrance to the Shrine’s bridge atop a five foot half ballard made of concrete and sculpted with a representation of evil emerging from the earth.
This impressive project has been funded by a single donor from Chicago, and although I have donated my time and talent to its completion for almost 2 years, complications in design and cost overruns in the casting of such an enormous piece has left a deficit, which I am working to make up.  In addition to the massive size, which has required me to work in sections, consideration had to be given to Florida’s weather conditions that can produce hurricane force winds in excess of 150 mph.  To meet the challenge we developed a complex stainless steel skeleton to branch the entire sculpture, then extended it six feet underground into a concrete pad and pylons weighing more than 8 tons.
Although the technology employed to support this work and that used to create the foam armature is state of the art, the process of sculpting and then casting the clay original dates back to the Bronze Age of 4000 B.C.  Little has changed through the ages, particularly in the casting which is done in the Lost Wax process, identical to the method used to produce the beautiful bronze art of the Renaissance.
Take a few moments to enjoy the accompanying video for a chronology of the work and a brief documentary of the process and steps involved in creating such a piece of art.
 
What Can You Do?
Today’s social media has allowed projects like this to touch tens of thousands, and provides us a platform to reach out to complete this work.  We are only eight weeks away.  Make a donation and help spread the word through your email, Facebook and Twitter contacts.  Every contribution makes a difference, little things add up.  When I work in clay, I build up in a process called stippling.  That is adding tiny dots of clay one on top of the other until the form develops.  From a distance the piece appears to be one entity, but up close, it’s obvious that in reality it is millions of tiny dots working together.  I estimate the sculpture of St. Michael incorporates more than 6.5 million of these little pieces of clay.  Proof that every little bit no matter how small has a place.
For those who can do more, please consider one of the perks accompanying this proposal.  Bronze, by its very nature can last thousands of years.  And we all know someone who has watched over and protected us, like St. Michael.  What better way to honor your own personal guardian be it, soldier, firefighter, policeman, EMT or any first responder than a personal memorial imbedded in a time capsule enclosed within St. Michael’s base.  (See Perk of $250 and $500)  Send us your dedication, the name of your protector and let us preserve that memory for generations to come, a millennium or more in the future.
 
We’re Almost There
Watch this site for weekly updates on our fundraising and on the sculpture of St. Michael.  As work progresses we will be adding new photos of the casting, finishing and installation.  Join us and be a part of something that will last for 5000 years.  
Finally, thank you.  Thank you for your financial support and your help in spreading the word.  There are few opportunities in life to be a part of something larger than ourselves, something lasting.  It is said that beauty, like art, reminds us of our destiny, it sets us back on our path, fills us with new hope, gives us the courage to live to the full, the unique gift of life.

<p><br/><strong>How did it all start?</strong><br/><br/>We founded the Black Rock French Quarter in 2011, in thanks to Burning Man for the profound contribution the festival has made to our lives - it was my 10th year on playa, and I felt the need to share something special. So it was that one of the most talented, creative, wonderful groups of people I have ever had the pleasure of struggling with, raised a living vision of the city of my heart, New Orleans, in the Black Rock Desert.</p>

<p><strong><br/>What Is The Money For?</strong><br/><br/>The target for this project has been set to cover the $10,000 it costs to have our 45 foot box trailer and 50 foot flatbed trailer repaired and shipped from LA to BRC and back again.<br/><br/>On top of that basic expense, we need to replace, reconfigure, and repaint much of the buildings themselves, to make the annual construction of the village more sustainable. Many MANY great minds came together to develop our building style, that we hope will transform other camps, and allow BRC to look and feel even more like the cities of our dreams - but it needs serious refinement to be easier to assemble, disassemble, and pack. In total, we would like to raise $16000 after the fees taken by Indiegogo, although we'll make due with whatever funds are available.</p>

As a society, artists can...well... keep a society sane.  We have secured some funding through our amazing supporters, but this festival has always been produced on a shoe-string.   Our artists contribute a lot for very little, and every bit of money we can raise here will go back to them - as thank you and to help them live to create more art here and elsewhere. How you can help
If you can help us with a donation, please do so here
There's other ways to participate - please sign up for news in the east end - http://eastendarts.ca/east-end-arts-information-form/ 
come out to our events and volunteer - we'll be posting more information about how to do this on our website - www.artofthedanforth.com  in a couple weeks",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What this is about</h3>
<p>The <a href=""neurobureau.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""neurobureau"">neurobureau</a> is a non-profit organization that supports “open neuroscience” — embracing the ideas that data, methods, and ideas can be freely shared. We are mostly scientists working in the field of brain mapping, as well as artists and curators interested in the brain (see <a href=""http://www.nitrc.org/projects/neurobureau"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> for a list of members). Since 2011, we have tried to push the boundaries between art and neuroscience during the <a href=""http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3511"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Human Brain Mapping</a> (HBM) conference. The HBM is the largest scientific conference exclusively dedicated to the field of brain mapping, with close to 3000 scientists attending. We want to organize three events:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href=""http://www.neurobureau.org/exhibitions/neurocartographies-2011/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brain-art show</a>, where established artists who work on the brain and the mind will display their work directly at the heart the conference. Some of the artists may attend to start collaborating with scientists.</li>
<li>a <a href=""http://www.neurobureau.org/brainart/galleries/brain-art-competition-2012/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brain-art competition</a>, where scientists are invited to submit their most beautiful illustrations of the brain.</li>
<li>a <a href=""http://www.neurobureau.org/events/beachside-galas/quebec-city-2011/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brain-art gala</a>, where the winners of the brain-art competition are announced. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have been successful in organizing these events in Québec City, Canada, in 2011, as well as Beijing, China, in 2012. This year, we want to repeat the experience at the <a href=""http://www.wsctc.com/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Washington State Convention Center</a>, in Seattle, June 16-20 2013. We are delighted that <a href=""http://thebeautifulbrain.com/author/noah/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Noah Hutton</a>, who is running <a href=""http://thebeautifulbrain.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thebeautifulbrain.com</a>, has accepted to curate the brain art show, and has already secured an impressive line-up of artists (an example below is ""my soul"" by Katherine Dowson). We have also booked the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkMzewt9fGo&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">crocodile</a> for the gala, a fantastic venue that has hosted concerts of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nirvana</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxKWTzr-k6s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pearl Jam</a> in the past. Unfortunately, we are still trying to figure out a model to fund this initiative. The HBM conference has been extremely supportive by providing us with premium space for the brain-art show, but there are still many other costs that need to be covered. To be true to the collaborative spirit of the neurobureau, we have decided to ask for direct support of the community. As we are not aware of many initiatives of this type on indiegogo or elsewhere, we are excited (and a bit anxious) to see how this unfolds. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make these events happen, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to rent/buy material for the art-show. This includes poster boards, screens, pedestals and lights. Expected costs: 2000$</li>
<li>to ship all the pieces. Expected costs: 2000$</li>
<li>to rent the venue for the party. Expected costs: 1500$ </li>
<li>to purchase/make all of the perks. Expected costs: 1000$</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past, we have always managed to make everything happen, although this has been painful for our own bank accounts. So even if we don't reach our targets, most of the events will still take place. But we hope to find a sustainable model of funding for the years to come. Also, Noah Hutton has offered to prepare a catalogue for the art show, along with essays and interviews of the artists. This is one of several perks we have prepared for you. We will also offer buttons and free drinks for those of you that will attend the conference. Finally, we also offer the possibility to individuals and institutions to become official sponsors of the art events at HBM, and get their names/logos listed at the show, on the neurobureau website as well as during the gala. Our party in Québec city had more than 700 people attending, and the brain art show will be located in a strategic lobby where everyone attending the conference will go several times a day. This is thus a great way for an insitution to get visibility in addition to supporting a good cause. </p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you had the opportunity to attend the HBM conference in the past you have seen how fantastic the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.299563330064348.70414.153692997984716&amp;type=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">art@HBM</a> events are. Contributions of both artists and scientists have been very inspirational. As data vizualization is one of the big challenge in the study of the brain, these contributions have without any doubt a great scientific value. Artists such as <a href=""http://nathalieregard.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nathalie Regard</a> have attended the conference and directly engaged with scientists. Beyond art, the gala has helped foster a collaborative spirit in the community, which matches the long-term goal of the neurobureau.</p>

</h3><h3><br/></h3></div>","The world is as sharp as the edge of a knife –Haida saying
Kestrel Tool is an artisan-owned and operated tool smith shop on Lopez Island in the Northwest corner of Washington state. Kestrel Tool consists of Gregg Blomberg, master toolmaker, and as of the beginning of this year, me Charlie Prince, the apprentice. You can help make sure that Kestrel Tools are available for future generations of artists and craftspeople.
We specialize in making handcrafted, top-of-the-line, artisan wood carving and sculpting tools. Our mainstays, the Crooked Knife and the Elbow Adze, are the traditional woodworking tools of Northwest Coast carvers. 
Kestrel finish adze, on a cedar box top.
  The crooked knife may have begun from the first curved wood cutting tool on the planet, the Beaver’s tooth. I can imagine people were inspired by the Beaver’s love of alder and the inherent efficiency of its design.



Kestrel Tool continues the North American woodworking tradition native to the Pacific Northwest Coast.  These tools are inherently different from the woodworking tools of European or Japanese heritage, and are used in a unique way, resulting in a unique art form. We are continually inspired by the Artists and Craftspeople who use our tools, and hope to help carry their art and culture into the future.



When I began learning to carve in the Northwest Coast styles, I couldn’t help but wonder, as the chips peeled off and fell around my feet, whether the shape of the tools evolved from the need to make the forms expressed in the artwork, or if the artwork evolved as it did from the shape of the tools. The two separate pieces, the art and the tools, are inseparable, and could hardly exist without each other. The result is magic.  The pleasure of creating a well made object is at least equal to the pleasure of using a well made tool to do so.

The Northwest Coast of North America is home to one of the world's greatest sculpting and woodworking traditions.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the generations of artists of coast for their inspiration.



 
Why this project?
Gregg has been looking for the right person to carry on this tradition and business since 2006.  After decades of producing the finest carving tools, he wants to spend more time with his family and work on his own art and all the tool ideas he has not had the time to develop.


Gregg had always hoped to find someone to carry on the business he had built, but had been unable to find an artisan who was interested in taking that on.  The business was almost sold to an Alaskan Native tribe, but the tribal corporation was unable to find someone within their membership to do it.  Gregg couldn't find anyone else and after what was to be a final run of tools, was ready to wrap it up, but at the same time felt reluctant to tell people that they could no longer get the tools they needed to make their artwork.  People kept ordering them, so he kept making them.


A few years ago I started carving with Gregg, and became interested in the business by way of using the tools.  My appreciation for the art form and love of carving evolved into a curiosity to know more about making the tools, why they are the way they are, and where they came from.
Joe David, Tla-o-qui-aht, one of the Northwest's top native artisans, using a Kestrel crooked knife to carve a mask.
These tools are used not just by creators of Northwest Coast art, but by people all over that make beautiful objects by hand.  If I don't take over the business of making these tools, they will cease being made.  I don't want that to happen.  I want future generations of artists to be able to experience the pleasure of using these unique and particularly well made tools.  These tools are awesome.  I want them to live on forever.Charlie carving the feast tray that is one of the rewards listed below.
Who am I?
I am Charlie Prince. I was born and raised in Seattle Washington. I have always had a love for the unique place in the world I’ve grown up in, as well as the art of the Native Peoples from this area. Since I was a small child I have been in awe of the Northwest Coast art that was all around me, from trips to the Burke museum to the beautiful totem poles downtown to staring at art while sitting on the ferries. All the while I was doing this, Gregg was busy crafting adzes and crooked knives to supply the very carvers whose work I marveled at.
What is my project?
For over a year now I have worked alongside Gregg, as his apprentice, learning the different aspects of toolmaking and all the processes that go into creating Kestrel Tools.  As of the beginning of this year we formed an LLC and became partners in the company.
We have agreed to work together as partners for two years, after which Gregg will hopefully get to go into semi-""retirement"", though he has promised to be there to consult with me and help me if I need it (not to mention probably give me a hard time).
The first step is to buy into the inventory that is at Gregg's shop.  So far I've made a down payment of $6500.
Through Indiegogo, I'm asking for help in raising the rest of the inventory money, as well as the money I need to purchase many of the basic tools needed for this venture, $22,000. 
My project is to set up a new Kestrel shop space with equipment and materials.  That includes everything from steel, copper and wood to grinding belts, buffing compounds, leather, twine, and all the other essentials that go into making these tools.  I will also buy the key pieces of machinery needed with this money.  We have agreed to work together at his shop until I can reach this goal. 
I can't buy Gregg's shop itself (I wish!), its not for sale.   Since the beginning Gregg has worked out of his shop on his property, but that shop is also used for other projects that don’t involve Kestrel tool. It is the shop he and Irene use to keep their homestead up and running, and once he ""retires"" he will use it to make art and play around with projects.   




This money is not the end all be all of what I need.  I know that I am going to work like crazy to get the rest. I appreciate all and any help you can give me in this, the first part of my journey as a toolmaker. 
What this money will buy
Tools I need (these are the basics as far as power tools go.  Other tooling will be acquired over time, and some will continue to be used at Gregg's shop.  Other tools, mainly smaller hand tools, I already own)-

Metal/wood bandsaw - $2000
Dust collection - $920
Disk/belt sander - $784
Drum/flap sander - $302
Burr King grinder - $3085
Baldor low rpm buffers(2) - $1845
Foredom rotary grinder - $540
Drill press - $426

Total - $9902
Inventory of raw materials and supplies  - $12,000
Grand total - $ 22,000

What do you get for helping out?
For over 30 years Kestrel Tool has been inspired by, and in turn has contributed to the art and culture of the Northwest Coast. Gregg, who has been the driving force behind Kestrel for its entire existence, is getting on in age and shouldn’t have to spend all day with his nose to the grindstone (quite literally!). By taking on the toolmaking, I aim to free up more time for Gregg to create and innovate in his art, which will benefit all of us who use his tools.
By giving through this campaign, you can help secure a future for Kestrel Tools.  We have come up with a selection of gifts to thank you for your contribution to this cause.




First off is a 8x10 print of the picture above, taken during the Kestrel pole raising.  A gift to symbolize the passing of the torch from one generation to the next, signed by Charlie and Gregg and worthy of framing.  We'll also send a thank you postcard, with a special surprise picture, to all contributors over $5.  Who doesn't like to get a postcard in the mail?




 Our friend, artist Barry Herem was kind enough to let us use a design of his, which we have emblazoned on an organic cotton T shirt, and on an etched glass coffee mug. Kestrel has used this image in the past in its Wolf Dancer art classes, an appropriate sentiment, since my larger dreams include reviving the NWC art classes in the future. 




 To us, continuing to use this design symbolizes that we are committed to carrying on the tradition of sharing knowledge and art.




In addition to these gifts we’ve made up a limited run of “carvers’ calipers”, which are hand crafted out of aluminum by yours truly. They are an amazing tool to have when making bowls and masks and things to gauge the thickness of the piece. We’re teaming this up with a nice maple and leather honing strop with the Kestrel logo burned onto the handle. This is a great reward if you (or someone you love) is a carver and cares about Kestrel Tool!




And if you're not a carver yet, our ""Get Carving""-reward might just get you started on becoming one. Get your hands on our C-bend, the most versatile of our knives and our Sitka gutter adze and we'll even throw in a sharpening stone and some literature to get you going.
That’s not all, either. I’ll be carving a series of ladles out of alder and cherry, for a nice piece of functional artwork in the style of the Northwest Coast. Hand carved by me using, you guessed it, Kestrel Tools! 




  As a special thank you for someone, I’m working on a Tlingit Style feast tray, of alder, which am detailing with a formline hawk design on each end.  I hope someone will be happy to set their table with it.



  And To top it all off, we’re offering a weekend carving class for up to 12 people, right here at the Kestrel shop. It’ll be like the Wolf Dancer classes of the past. This will be a NWC canoe-form bowl carving class, but advanced carvers should feel free to bring the project of their choice.  We're really excited about this one!

day, I was browsing through the greeting card racks at a local store,
looking for a birthday card for a good friend of mine, when I
realized that most of the cards were just tragically boring. The
whole point of picking out a greeting card is finding one that's a
perfect match for the person you intend to give it to; but the
problem is that in order to maximize profits, the major greeting card
companies try to make cards they can sell to as many people as
humanly possible. This results in a lot of really bland, generic

<h1>
<b>Who </b><b>you're dealing with:</b>
</h1>
<p>I'm
a musician, designer, photographer, and above all, a computer nerd. A
few years ago, my friends and I started selling some of our crafts
and artwork at anime and comic conventions at artist's alley tables,
(and even the dealers room, in one case). In fact, if you've been to
Anime Boston, Connecticon, or Otakon during these past three years
you might have even already met us. </p><p>Here's a sample of some of our past work:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/253564/files/20131210125931-Funky_Fox_Collage.jpg?1386709171"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It's
been a lot of fun so far, but to continue doing these kinds of
things, I need to turn it from a hobby to a legitimate business. We
need to expand into a new line up of products.</span><br/></p>
<p>The
idea to make greeting cards was one we actually toyed around with
before. The problem is that for greeting cards to be a practical
offering, you need a very wide variety of designs for cards so that
people can get that one perfect card for that special someone. A mere
10 or so different card designs with just our own artstyles wouldn't
be enough for our card idea to take off. We need hundreds of designs,
with all kinds of artstyles and themes. That is way more than our
small group of artists can make alone, so we scrapped the idea. But we're
now realizing that what was once a limitation is actually an
opportunity to build something really big, in what will be my most
ambitious project to date. 
</p>
<h4>Geekigrams
the company</h4>
<p>I
realized that all I really need to do to get this greeting card line
off the ground is the participation of more artists, and some
start-up cash to do the initial print runs. I've already begun
recruiting artists for this project and I'm getting a very positive
reception so far. 
</p>
<p>Our
only main advantage over “traditional” card companies is going to
be the work of our awesome artists, so the artists come first. If
Geekigrams is successful, I want every artist who participates to
share that success. But as a freelancer myself, I know that clients
that pull the “well, you might be paid if we actually make any
money” trick are terrible to work with. So, our artists will get
paid an upfront commission fee according to their standard freelance
rates, AND they will also be offered a royalty payment based on the
number of cards produced.</p>
<p>All
artists are treated as partners. They keep all rights to their
original artwork and Geekigrams only licenses it. Geekigrams will
collaborate with artists to produce and market finished card designs
such as the ones you can buy in stores now, just cooler. 
</p>
<p>I
want all potential Geekigrams customers to know that when you buy our
cards, you will be supporting the independent artists who help to
make them. 
</p>

your contributions will do:</b></h1>
<p>So
here's where the crowdfunding campaign money is going:</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/251996/files/20131209194252-Budget.jpg?1386646972"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>
<p><b>Fees:</b>
Indiegogo fees, Paypal fees. Credit card processing fees, Taxes. All
that stuff. Fun.</p>
<p><b>Print
Costs:</b> For greeting card printing to be cost truly cost effective, it
needs to be done in bulk. With enough starting cash, we can print
hundreds or even thousands of cards at once which would not only make
them more profitable for us and let the business become sustainable,
but would also allow for us to offer the cards to retailers at
wholesale rates so you may be able to buy them at your local comic,
anime or game shop. 
</p>
<p><b>Artist's
Commission fees and royalty payments:</b>  We won't be able to get art
from the best artists if we only offer some wishy-washy payment
scheme of “well... you might possibly get paid one day if this all
works out” So we pay all of our artists with upfront payments, AND
offer a royalty fee for the cards produced with their art. We need a
starting pool of money for those payments before the cards begin
selling and it becomes a self-sustaining system.</p>
<p><b>Stock:</b>
A very small amount of the budget will go towards things like
commercial licenses for fonts and typefaces and other design elements
to accompany the art. 
</p>
<p><b>Marketing:</b>
Yeah, we know. Advertisements suck. You hate commercials and ads, we
hate commercials and ads, and we all love adblock. Probably the last
thing you want to hear is that ANY of your money is going towards any
sort of marketing budget. That said, we will have a very small
marketing budget, and not a single cent of it will go towards
annoying or obtrusive adds we know you're going to ignore and block
anyway. Most of the advertisement budget will go towards people that
actually need it, like ads on websites for independent webcomics, and
once the budget grows big enough to allow it, things like convention
sponsorships. Once we grow enough for a wholesale program some will
be put towards reaching out to retailers to join the reseller's
program. 
</p>
<p><b>Business
administration stuff:</b> Includes the costs incurred just from running a
small business. One of the most important parts of this will be
running the online shop. At the beginning we can make pages on
existing storefronts, but once the catalog is bigger, our own custom
storefront my be necessary. It would allow for better search and
sorting options on cards, among other things. The Geekigrams business
model revolves around freelancers, independent artists and
contractors, so these costs will be relatively small compared to
other companies. 
</p><h4><b>Budget Milestones:</b></h4>
<p>So,
here are some fund-raising milestones to give you an idea of what
we'll be able to accomplish with a given starting budget: 
</p>
<p><b>$1000
and less:</b> A small selection of cards (you're looking at about 15-25
designs, tops) will be be printed in very small print runs and sold
through an online marketplace like Etsy, Ebay, or Storenvy. This is a
very slow start, and the business would have a hard time taking off
from this level. But it's a start. This is where we are now.</p>
<p><b>$2750
and less:</b> About the same as above, but with more copies of more card
designs. This level allows us to hire more freelance artists to allow
for a much better variety of artwork.</p>
<p><b>$2750-$10,000-</b>
Once the fund-raising goal is exceeded then the project has enough to
really get rolling. There will be enough to get about 40-50 unique
card designs and print them in small-to midsize short runs. (50-200
copies of each card) This will be just enough for Geekigrams to
hopefully be able to generate enough profit to grow itself and
continue building up a library of awesome card designs. The the
higher we get above our initial $2750 goal, the more card designs we
can release sooner. For example, with $6000 we'd have over 100 unique cards available by this summer! </p>
<p><b>Above
$10,000:</b> Getting this much to start with would be a dream! This would
allow us to go right into “phase two” of the business plan, and
would allow us to do print runs in larger quantities. (over 500
copies of each design) What that would allow us to do, is offer a
much lower wholesale rate to businesses and vendors. What this means
for customers, is that you may be much more likely to pick up a
Geekigrams card from a local retailer or from a vendor at your local
convention. That doesn't mean you should expect to see them at a
grocery store anytime soon, but we believe small independent game,
comic, and anime shops may be interested in stocking our cards since
we have the same exact target audience. (and on that note, if you
have such a shop, are a vendor at comic/anime conventions, or are
otherwise interested in reselling Geekigram cards, please don't
hesitate to contact me. We'll put you in our contacts list and you'll
be among the first to know about our wholesale and reseller's plans
once they become available) 
</p>
<p><b>Beyond
that: </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The
most obvious answer is more money=more card designs, the more we can
raise, and earn, the better the selection will be. But after we reach
$10,000, whether we manage to raise it right now or build up to it
later, we will have some more options on what directions to go in.</span></p>
<p>One
is that we'll be able to start offering cards with more unique
features. They'll still be covered with awesome art, of course, but
having a large budget will allow us to make cards with gimmicks like
unique sizes or shapes; use special printing like foil stamping or
glow-in-the-dark-ink; pop-up cards; cards that play music and sounds
and other things like that. Also once the company becomes big enough
we can pursue licensing deals to use officially-licensed characters
from some of your favorite anime, games and other series for special
cards. We may be able to consider translating some cards and
producing cards in other languages than just English.

Rewards:</b><br/></p>
<p>Of
course, we have goodies for everyone who helps to back us! Most tiers
include everything in the previous tiers unless otherwise noted. Let
me walk you through the tiers and perks: 
</p>
<p><b>$1-</b>
<b>A digital thank you card</b> sent to your E-mail address. It'll likely be
Holiday/New Years themed so we'll try to send them out a little early
before the campaign actually ends so you can get those warm, fuzzy
new years feelings on time. 
</p>
<p><b>$5-</b>
Once the first batches of cards go up for sale on our online store,
we'll send you a <b>$5 gift card/voucher</b> than you can use to order a
card through it. If there isn't anything in the initial batch that
really speaks to you, you can hang on to your voucher until you're ready to use it. More designs will be available with time, though the
speed at which they are released will depend on the success of this
campaign. There will be a bare minimum of 15 designs available at
launch, even if this campaign does not make it's goal. Expect to get
your voucher by the end of February, though we're aiming for the
beginning of it in case you want to get a Valentine's Day card. Please be aware that the $5 voucher may not cover your shipping costs, especially if you are located outside the U.S.A. so you may need to spend a small amount of additional money to actually receive your card when you choose to redeem it. </p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$10-
A physical personally hand-signed thank you card</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> from us, mailed to your
address. They'll be among the first ever Geekigrams cards printed.
It's just a more personal way of thanking you for helping make this
project a success. Also includes the digital stuff. All tiers that
include shipping physical goods to you will include this. If we do
really well, I might get some serious hand cramps, but it'll be worth
it! I'll start mailing these as soon as the campaign ends. The
shipping is included on this one since all I need is a stamp or two.
If you get a bigger perk the card may be included in the whole
package so you may get it later along with everything else. If you
want it ASAP for whatever reason, let us know.</span><br/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$25-
4 Card Variety pack.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> You'll get a list of cards you can choose from to build your own </span>variety<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> pack of cards. You can keep or display them
yourself, or give them to friends and family. That's what they're
used for, after all! Includes the $10 tier. Like with the vouchers,
expect this by the end of February 2014. Please add $4 for
international shipping, US shipping is included.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>$50
8 card Variety pack with bonus shopping bag.</b> Same as the $25 tier but
you can make twice as many selections. We happen to have some special
reusable shopping bags leftover from our last convention, so get the
big pack and they'll be packaged in one of these: 
</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/251885/files/20131209183643-Convention_Bag.jpg?1386643003"" src="""" style=""width: 430.57763975155285px; height: 362px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>These
are custom designed by the Geekigrams lead designer (That'd be me).
They're extra wide and the perfect size for posters and art prints,
so they're great for shopping at conventions and craft fair types of
events. They still work pretty well for grocery shopping and the like
too. Please add $5 for international shipping, US shipping is
included.</p><p><b>$60 And a poster! </b>You get everything in the $50 pack above, plus an bonus 11x17 poster. You will have a choice that includes the following samples, and there are more on the way! <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/276080/files/20131223114927-VerticalPosters.jpg?1387828167"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>$85
The “super custom” 10 card variety pack with custom 3” pins</b>-
Everything in the $50 tier with another 2 cards added to your special
bag. (does not include a poster like the $60 tier) Rather than double the number of cards again, we're instead
offering custom 3” pinback buttons designed by the Geekigrams main
designer (again, that's me!) that can say anything you want on them.
Anything. (Seriously anything, though I will honestly be disappointed
in you if it's something racist or hateful to a group of people) You
will get 10 copies of your custom design. The pins are something that
I already make for events and things, so check out some samples:</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/251967/files/20131209191406-Pins.jpg?1386645246"" src="""" style=""width: 413.6412078152753px; height: 410px;""/></p><p></p><p>Note
that this perk is for any WORDS you want on the pin, and not any
picture. I will add pictures and designs to your request text to make
a more visually appealing pin. I will do the design work for you, you
do not have to provide any design materials, though you can if you
want to.  You can request certain pictures be added and I will try to
accommodate, but really complex or specific requests for images may
be denied. To clarify, asking for a cat or a riceball or something is
fine. Asking for Super Saiyan 4 Goku in Spartan armor beating up
Megatron with a giant tuna is not. If you want to design the pin
yourself and just have us manufacture it for you, you may do so. We
can send you a template as a .psd, .ai or .png. Either way, I will
NOT honor any requests that involve using someone else's copyrighted
art without permission. If you are considering ordering this perk and
are unsure if your request is acceptable under these rules, feel free
to ask us about it before pledging and we'll let you know if it is.
The only restriction on the text is length. I can't fit a whole novel
onto a pin, after all. Also, I only have English and Japanese fonts, with a few 'international' fonts with European accent characters and such. So if you happen to want your pin to say something in a language that isn't in Latin characters or Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji; such as Russian or Arabic, I may be unable to fill that request. </p>
<p>Please
add $5 for international shipping, US shipping is included.</p><p><b>$100 Giant Variety Pack.</b> Same as the $85 tier, but you get to add 3 posters to it. </p>
<p><b>$1000
Early Adopter Wholesale pack.</b> You get pretty much all of the cards.
400 cards, which is 5-10 copies each of nearly 50 unique card
designs. Basically the perfect amount of cards for a retail display
stand. Or enough to make a massive card fort.  Math says this perk is
$2.50 per card, and the suggested retail will be $5 per card. (The
number of cards will be adjusted, so that if the wholesale pack
contains any 'value' cards with a retail value of less then normal, we'll add extra cards to the total. We'll make sure the total suggested retail
value stays at or above $2000) That is the lowest wholesale rate we
can currently offer, but if you want to beef up that store display,
or expand your card fort in the future, you will be eligible for
special deals and discounts once we ARE able to offer a more robust
wholesale program, as a way to thank you for being with us from the
very beginning.  This megapack will not be all sent at once, but in
2-4 installments as more cards are made. The first one should arrive
in late February or March of 2014. You should receive the last one by
the end of summer. Please add $35 for international shipping. Sorry
to tack on costs to something that's already $1000, but shooting that
much cardboard over the ocean is a little pricey. This does not
include the bonuses from the smaller 'retail' priced variety packs. 
</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Other
info:</b><br/></p>
<p>If
you have any questions about any of these perks, don't hesitate to
ask us. If you want some combination or amount of things that isn't
available as a tier currently, ask us and we might be able to build a
custom pledge for you. If we hit our goal early enough, we may be
able to offer some special Geekigrams merchandise with some
additional perks, but this is what we can guarantee delivery on even
if the goal is not met. 
</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; line-height: 40px;"">FAQ:</b><br/></p>
<p><i><b>Will
I still get my rewards if the funding goal is not met?</b></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Yes,
and that is the reason it's flexible funding. The reward tiers are
self funding. However, low levels of funding may delay the delivery
and/or result in fewer choices of cards you can pick from early on.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p><b><i>What will these cards cost when they're released?</i></b></p>
<p>	$4-5 USD retail price. Almost all of the cards will be priced
within that range. You may see some $3 budget ones that are primarily
text based or use only simple design elements made by the lead
designer (That'd be me) that don't use licensed artworks. You might
also see future cards that cost more than $5, with features like
special printing, oversized cards, or things of that nature. 
</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Why
should I fund you? If I really want some geeky greeting cards I can
order them from a print-on-demand service.</i></b><br/></p>
<p>	Well,
that IS possible, but we'd like to make it better and easier. Many of
those services would require you to make your own card designs, and
not everyone can make top-quality designs on their own. If you simply
use art that you find online, then that qualifies as art theft if you
don't have permission. Some print on demand services will print them
anyway, (if they don't catch you) but our cards will support the
artists to help fund them so that can keep making awesome art. Print
services that allow you to purchase designs that others have made
often have the similar problems to the stores, in that the kinds of
cards you would actually want might be buried among ones you don't,
and some of them don't have much quality control since anyone can put
their designs up. Sites that are more artist centric that have high
quality art prints, such as DeviantArt or Society 6, do offer cards
with some of the types of art we want to feature, but they're often
sold as blank stationary cards and usually in packs. We want to
collaborate with artists to create 'complete' greeting cards with
text and design as well as art, and sell them individually, which is
a different and more specific focus than what many of the available
companies and services offer. 
</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>So,
it's 'that time of year,' isn't it? Can I order some Christmas/New
Years cards from you?</i></b></p>
<p>There
will be one or two holiday cards in the initial batch of cards, but I
literally mean one or two. Due to the timing of the campaign, by the
time the cards are in full production, it will be mid-january and too
late for the holiday season. For those that donate early enough and
would prefer getting a holiday card as their “thank you card”
I'll try to send those a little early before the campaign actually
ends, but I can't guarantee you'll receive anything in time for
Christmas/New Years.  
</p>
<p>Besides
that, since we're just getting started, we're going to avoid making
many holiday cards during our first year; instead focusing on cards
that sell year round like birthday cards, thank you cards, sympathy
cards, etc. This is because if we were to make a lot of cards for
something like Valentine's Day, then any of the cards we don't manage
to sell in time for the holiday will be unsellable for a whole year
until it rolls around again. As a new company just getting off the
ground, we can't afford to sit on a large pile of unsellable stock
(yet) Once we achieve more stable sales, then we can afford to
produce a better selection of 'limited time' cards. That said, we
will still have a small selection for upcoming holidays, so when you
cash in your perks that include cards, there will be a few choices
for Valentine's day cards you can pick. I can guarantee at least one
since we already have a Valentine's day card in the sample pictures
on this very campaign. 
</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>I'm
an artist and I am interested in making cards with you. How can I
apply/join?</i></b></p>
<p>	Just
shoot us an email or message expressing your interest with a link to
an online gallery or portfolio of your work, or check out our job
posting on the DeviantArt and ConceptArt job forums. We are hiring on
a freelance/contract basis and will pay you per piece of art. We will
consider every genre of art, both digital and traditional, and they
don't necessarily have to be anime/comic/game styles of art,
especially if you have a unique style that isn't the kind of thing
you'd see on the 'generic' greeting cards at stores. We will also
consider writers who are interested in writing for cards. 
</p>
<p>	We
are already hiring right now, even as the campaign is running.
Artists will be selected based on the quality of their work and
professionalism. Initially we are aiming for a diverse line-up of
cards so priority will go towards recruiting artists with a very wide
variety of styles,  and we will continually hire more artists as the
budget expands. 
</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>I'm
a retailer and want to sell your cards at my store/booth. How can I
become a re-seller?</i></b></p>
<p>Send
us an e-mail and we can try to negotiate an arrangement that works
for you. We don't have a full re-seller's program or set wholesale
prices yet. The “early adopter” wholesale perks are currently the
lowest wholesale prices we can safely promise at our current level,
but if we are able to exceed stretch goals we may be able to lower it
further thanks to bulk printing. If you get in early and we're able
to lower the price later, we'll try to cut you some kind of special
discount or deal (like timed exclusive cards or something similar) to
thank you for sticking with us right from the beginning!</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>As
a customer, where will I be able to buy these cards?</i></b></p>
<p>We
will be opening an online store, where anyone in the world can order
Geekigrams cards to be shipped to them. In addition, since the people
behind Geekigrams already travel around the East Coast convention
circuit, we will get dealer's room booths at conventions such as
Anime Boston, Otakon, Katsucon, Connecticon, AnimeNext, etc. We would
also like to form partnerships with retailers, so it's possible that
you may one day be able to buy them at your local comic or hobby
store, but at this stage that is not a promise we can guarantee. 
</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>What
is the deal with this 'resale' program you keep mentioning? It's
sounding awfully 'big business' of you. 
</i></b></p>
<p>	The
only reason I'm so enthusiastic about it, is that getting such a
resale program in place could make it possible for you to walk into
your local store and buy one of our cards right then and there,
without having to deal with shipping fees and wait times. Honestly,
we'll make more profit off selling cards directly, but greeting cards
are often things that are bought on impulse or at the last minute, so
we'd love to make that a possibility. That goes doubly if we get
international partners who can do all the importing and save you from the international shipping costs. That's all there is to it. 
</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>I
have this really great idea for a card! Can I submit it to you?</i></b></p>
<p>For
legal reasons, I would recommend you do not, unless you've already
worked out some kind of contract/agreement with us as writer/artist.
We will not accept unsolicited card ideas because if we take a
suggestion and wind up using it or something similar, and the person
later tries to claim copyright on it, then that creates a legal
dispute. That said, that applies to specific card ideas. If you have
general suggestions like “I want more cards with anime styled art”
or “Way too many cards have anime style art, more western comic art
please!” or “My best friend is a huge fan of _______, can you
make some cards about _________?” we are always open to general
feedback.  
</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>Specifically,
what subject matter will your cards deal with? Will you have cards
about [your hobby or geeky interest goes here]? I don't see anything
like that on the samples on this page.</i></b></p>
<p>Keep
in mind, the few samples on this page were done on a VERY limited
budget, (hence the need for this campaign) so they don't cover
anything close to all the subjects and styles I would ultimately like
to cover. Anime, Sci-fi, Comics, Games, Fantasy, Books, D&amp;D,
Steampunk, Internet, Math/Science, Role-playing, Pixel art, and
pretty much everything of geeky/nerdy interest. And like I said in
the previous answer, we're wide open to feedback so let us know what
you'd like to see and we'll look into getting it done for you. 
</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><i>So,
are these cards ONLY for geeky/nerdy people?</i></b></p>
<p>	Not
at all, and most definitely yes. That is squarely my target audience,
but it's not like you're going to have to take some kind of “geek
cred” test to buy them. With the growing popularity of things that
fall under a geeky domain, even if you're not a self labeled 'geek,'
I still think you'll be able to find something that will appeal to
you or a loved one. Have you ever enjoyed movies/shows like The
Avengers, Game of Thrones, Star Wars/Trek or Lord of the Rings? Read
Harry Potter? Played pretty much any video game ever? I'm sure we'll
have something you can appreciate.

day, I was browsing through the greeting card racks at a local store,
looking for a birthday card for a good friend of mine, when I
realized that most of the cards were just tragically boring. The
whole point of picking out a greeting card is finding one that's a
perfect match for the person you intend to give it to; but the
problem is that in order to maximize profits, the major greeting card
companies try to make cards they can sell to as many people as
humanly possible. This results in a lot of really bland, generic
cards that we all know will go straight into the trash.
We
need something different. Something... nerdy. 

Geekigrams
are a line of greeting cards inspired by the games, anime, comics,
books, and films that have captured the imaginations of myself, my
friends, and geeks/nerds/otaku/gamers/label-of-your-choice-s everywhere. They will have language, references and jokes made for people
with geeky hobbies, and use artstyles you wouldn’t typically see on
your grocery store greeting card rack. Rather than make generic
greeting cards that are just 'acceptable' to most of the population,
I want to make ones that will be loved by specific groups of people. Cards that tell someone you appreciate them and the interests and
hobbies that make them a unique person, Cards that will be a worthy
addition to a collection of convention art prints, anime figurines,
video game artbooks and other kinds of geeky memorabilia, Cards like
these:
And
I need your help to make it happen.

Who you're dealing with:

I'm
a musician, designer, photographer, and above all, a computer nerd. A
few years ago, my friends and I started selling some of our crafts
and artwork at anime and comic conventions at artist's alley tables,
(and even the dealers room, in one case). In fact, if you've been to
Anime Boston, Connecticon, or Otakon during these past three years
you might have even already met us. Here's a sample of some of our past work:It's
been a lot of fun so far, but to continue doing these kinds of
things, I need to turn it from a hobby to a legitimate business. We
need to expand into a new line up of products.
The
idea to make greeting cards was one we actually toyed around with
before. The problem is that for greeting cards to be a practical
offering, you need a very wide variety of designs for cards so that
people can get that one perfect card for that special someone. A mere
10 or so different card designs with just our own artstyles wouldn't
be enough for our card idea to take off. We need hundreds of designs,
with all kinds of artstyles and themes. That is way more than our
small group of artists can make alone, so we scrapped the idea. But we're
now realizing that what was once a limitation is actually an
opportunity to build something really big, in what will be my most
ambitious project to date. 

Geekigrams
the company
I
realized that all I really need to do to get this greeting card line
off the ground is the participation of more artists, and some
start-up cash to do the initial print runs. I've already begun
recruiting artists for this project and I'm getting a very positive
reception so far. 

Our
only main advantage over “traditional” card companies is going to
be the work of our awesome artists, so the artists come first. If
Geekigrams is successful, I want every artist who participates to
share that success. But as a freelancer myself, I know that clients
that pull the “well, you might be paid if we actually make any
money” trick are terrible to work with. So, our artists will get
paid an upfront commission fee according to their standard freelance
rates, AND they will also be offered a royalty payment based on the
number of cards produced.
All
artists are treated as partners. They keep all rights to their
original artwork and Geekigrams only licenses it. Geekigrams will
collaborate with artists to produce and market finished card designs
such as the ones you can buy in stores now, just cooler. 

I
want all potential Geekigrams customers to know that when you buy our
cards, you will be supporting the independent artists who help to
make them. 

What
your contributions will do:
So
here's where the crowdfunding campaign money is going:

Fees:
Indiegogo fees, Paypal fees. Credit card processing fees, Taxes. All
that stuff. Fun.
Print
Costs: For greeting card printing to be cost truly cost effective, it
needs to be done in bulk. With enough starting cash, we can print
hundreds or even thousands of cards at once which would not only make
them more profitable for us and let the business become sustainable,
but would also allow for us to offer the cards to retailers at
wholesale rates so you may be able to buy them at your local comic,
anime or game shop. 

Artist's
Commission fees and royalty payments:  We won't be able to get art
from the best artists if we only offer some wishy-washy payment
scheme of “well... you might possibly get paid one day if this all
works out” So we pay all of our artists with upfront payments, AND
offer a royalty fee for the cards produced with their art. We need a
starting pool of money for those payments before the cards begin
selling and it becomes a self-sustaining system.
Stock:
A very small amount of the budget will go towards things like
commercial licenses for fonts and typefaces and other design elements
to accompany the art. 

Marketing:
Yeah, we know. Advertisements suck. You hate commercials and ads, we
hate commercials and ads, and we all love adblock. Probably the last
thing you want to hear is that ANY of your money is going towards any
sort of marketing budget. That said, we will have a very small
marketing budget, and not a single cent of it will go towards
annoying or obtrusive adds we know you're going to ignore and block
anyway. Most of the advertisement budget will go towards people that
actually need it, like ads on websites for independent webcomics, and
once the budget grows big enough to allow it, things like convention
sponsorships. Once we grow enough for a wholesale program some will
be put towards reaching out to retailers to join the reseller's
program. 

Business
administration stuff: Includes the costs incurred just from running a
small business. One of the most important parts of this will be
running the online shop. At the beginning we can make pages on
existing storefronts, but once the catalog is bigger, our own custom
storefront my be necessary. It would allow for better search and
sorting options on cards, among other things. The Geekigrams business
model revolves around freelancers, independent artists and
contractors, so these costs will be relatively small compared to
other companies. 
Budget Milestones:
So,
here are some fund-raising milestones to give you an idea of what
we'll be able to accomplish with a given starting budget: 

$1000
and less: A small selection of cards (you're looking at about 15-25
designs, tops) will be be printed in very small print runs and sold
through an online marketplace like Etsy, Ebay, or Storenvy. This is a
very slow start, and the business would have a hard time taking off
from this level. But it's a start. This is where we are now.
$2750
and less: About the same as above, but with more copies of more card
designs. This level allows us to hire more freelance artists to allow
for a much better variety of artwork.
$2750-$10,000-
Once the fund-raising goal is exceeded then the project has enough to
really get rolling. There will be enough to get about 40-50 unique
card designs and print them in small-to midsize short runs. (50-200
copies of each card) This will be just enough for Geekigrams to
hopefully be able to generate enough profit to grow itself and
continue building up a library of awesome card designs. The the
higher we get above our initial $2750 goal, the more card designs we
can release sooner. For example, with $6000 we'd have over 100 unique cards available by this summer! 
Above
$10,000: Getting this much to start with would be a dream! This would
allow us to go right into “phase two” of the business plan, and
would allow us to do print runs in larger quantities. (over 500
copies of each design) What that would allow us to do, is offer a
much lower wholesale rate to businesses and vendors. What this means
for customers, is that you may be much more likely to pick up a
Geekigrams card from a local retailer or from a vendor at your local
convention. That doesn't mean you should expect to see them at a
grocery store anytime soon, but we believe small independent game,
comic, and anime shops may be interested in stocking our cards since
we have the same exact target audience. (and on that note, if you
have such a shop, are a vendor at comic/anime conventions, or are
otherwise interested in reselling Geekigram cards, please don't
hesitate to contact me. We'll put you in our contacts list and you'll
be among the first to know about our wholesale and reseller's plans
once they become available) 

Beyond
that: The
most obvious answer is more money=more card designs, the more we can
raise, and earn, the better the selection will be. But after we reach
$10,000, whether we manage to raise it right now or build up to it
later, we will have some more options on what directions to go in.
One
is that we'll be able to start offering cards with more unique
features. They'll still be covered with awesome art, of course, but
having a large budget will allow us to make cards with gimmicks like
unique sizes or shapes; use special printing like foil stamping or
glow-in-the-dark-ink; pop-up cards; cards that play music and sounds
and other things like that. Also once the company becomes big enough
we can pursue licensing deals to use officially-licensed characters
from some of your favorite anime, games and other series for special
cards. We may be able to consider translating some cards and
producing cards in other languages than just English. 
The
Rewards:
Of
course, we have goodies for everyone who helps to back us! Most tiers
include everything in the previous tiers unless otherwise noted. Let
me walk you through the tiers and perks: 

$1-
A digital thank you card sent to your E-mail address. It'll likely be
Holiday/New Years themed so we'll try to send them out a little early
before the campaign actually ends so you can get those warm, fuzzy
new years feelings on time. 

$5-
Once the first batches of cards go up for sale on our online store,
we'll send you a $5 gift card/voucher than you can use to order a
card through it. If there isn't anything in the initial batch that
really speaks to you, you can hang on to your voucher until you're ready to use it. More designs will be available with time, though the
speed at which they are released will depend on the success of this
campaign. There will be a bare minimum of 15 designs available at
launch, even if this campaign does not make it's goal. Expect to get
your voucher by the end of February, though we're aiming for the
beginning of it in case you want to get a Valentine's Day card. Please be aware that the $5 voucher may not cover your shipping costs, especially if you are located outside the U.S.A. so you may need to spend a small amount of additional money to actually receive your card when you choose to redeem it. 
$10-
A physical personally hand-signed thank you card from us, mailed to your
address. They'll be among the first ever Geekigrams cards printed.
It's just a more personal way of thanking you for helping make this
project a success. Also includes the digital stuff. All tiers that
include shipping physical goods to you will include this. If we do
really well, I might get some serious hand cramps, but it'll be worth
it! I'll start mailing these as soon as the campaign ends. The
shipping is included on this one since all I need is a stamp or two.
If you get a bigger perk the card may be included in the whole
package so you may get it later along with everything else. If you
want it ASAP for whatever reason, let us know.$25-
4 Card Variety pack. You'll get a list of cards you can choose from to build your own variety pack of cards. You can keep or display them
yourself, or give them to friends and family. That's what they're
used for, after all! Includes the $10 tier. Like with the vouchers,
expect this by the end of February 2014. Please add $4 for
international shipping, US shipping is included.
$50
8 card Variety pack with bonus shopping bag. Same as the $25 tier but
you can make twice as many selections. We happen to have some special
reusable shopping bags leftover from our last convention, so get the
big pack and they'll be packaged in one of these: 


These
are custom designed by the Geekigrams lead designer (That'd be me).
They're extra wide and the perfect size for posters and art prints,
so they're great for shopping at conventions and craft fair types of
events. They still work pretty well for grocery shopping and the like
too. Please add $5 for international shipping, US shipping is
included.$60 And a poster! You get everything in the $50 pack above, plus an bonus 11x17 poster. You will have a choice that includes the following samples, and there are more on the way! 
$85
The “super custom” 10 card variety pack with custom 3” pins-
Everything in the $50 tier with another 2 cards added to your special
bag. (does not include a poster like the $60 tier) Rather than double the number of cards again, we're instead
offering custom 3” pinback buttons designed by the Geekigrams main
designer (again, that's me!) that can say anything you want on them.
Anything. (Seriously anything, though I will honestly be disappointed
in you if it's something racist or hateful to a group of people) You
will get 10 copies of your custom design. The pins are something that
I already make for events and things, so check out some samples:
Note
that this perk is for any WORDS you want on the pin, and not any
picture. I will add pictures and designs to your request text to make
a more visually appealing pin. I will do the design work for you, you
do not have to provide any design materials, though you can if you
want to.  You can request certain pictures be added and I will try to
accommodate, but really complex or specific requests for images may
be denied. To clarify, asking for a cat or a riceball or something is
fine. Asking for Super Saiyan 4 Goku in Spartan armor beating up
Megatron with a giant tuna is not. If you want to design the pin
yourself and just have us manufacture it for you, you may do so. We
can send you a template as a .psd, .ai or .png. Either way, I will
NOT honor any requests that involve using someone else's copyrighted
art without permission. If you are considering ordering this perk and
are unsure if your request is acceptable under these rules, feel free
to ask us about it before pledging and we'll let you know if it is.
The only restriction on the text is length. I can't fit a whole novel
onto a pin, after all. Also, I only have English and Japanese fonts, with a few 'international' fonts with European accent characters and such. So if you happen to want your pin to say something in a language that isn't in Latin characters or Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji; such as Russian or Arabic, I may be unable to fill that request. 
Please
add $5 for international shipping, US shipping is included.$100 Giant Variety Pack. Same as the $85 tier, but you get to add 3 posters to it. 
$1000
Early Adopter Wholesale pack. You get pretty much all of the cards.
400 cards, which is 5-10 copies each of nearly 50 unique card
designs. Basically the perfect amount of cards for a retail display
stand. Or enough to make a massive card fort.  Math says this perk is
$2.50 per card, and the suggested retail will be $5 per card. (The
number of cards will be adjusted, so that if the wholesale pack
contains any 'value' cards with a retail value of less then normal, we'll add extra cards to the total. We'll make sure the total suggested retail
value stays at or above $2000) That is the lowest wholesale rate we
can currently offer, but if you want to beef up that store display,
or expand your card fort in the future, you will be eligible for
special deals and discounts once we ARE able to offer a more robust
wholesale program, as a way to thank you for being with us from the
very beginning.  This megapack will not be all sent at once, but in
2-4 installments as more cards are made. The first one should arrive
in late February or March of 2014. You should receive the last one by
the end of summer. Please add $35 for international shipping. Sorry
to tack on costs to something that's already $1000, but shooting that
much cardboard over the ocean is a little pricey. This does not
include the bonuses from the smaller 'retail' priced variety packs. 

Other
info:
If
you have any questions about any of these perks, don't hesitate to
ask us. If you want some combination or amount of things that isn't
available as a tier currently, ask us and we might be able to build a
custom pledge for you. If we hit our goal early enough, we may be
able to offer some special Geekigrams merchandise with some
additional perks, but this is what we can guarantee delivery on even
if the goal is not met. 

FAQ:
Will
I still get my rewards if the funding goal is not met?Yes,
and that is the reason it's flexible funding. The reward tiers are
self funding. However, low levels of funding may delay the delivery
and/or result in fewer choices of cards you can pick from early on.
What will these cards cost when they're released?
	$4-5 USD retail price. Almost all of the cards will be priced
within that range. You may see some $3 budget ones that are primarily
text based or use only simple design elements made by the lead
designer (That'd be me) that don't use licensed artworks. You might
also see future cards that cost more than $5, with features like
special printing, oversized cards, or things of that nature. 

Why
should I fund you? If I really want some geeky greeting cards I can
order them from a print-on-demand service.
	Well,
that IS possible, but we'd like to make it better and easier. Many of
those services would require you to make your own card designs, and
not everyone can make top-quality designs on their own. If you simply
use art that you find online, then that qualifies as art theft if you
don't have permission. Some print on demand services will print them
anyway, (if they don't catch you) but our cards will support the
artists to help fund them so that can keep making awesome art. Print
services that allow you to purchase designs that others have made
often have the similar problems to the stores, in that the kinds of
cards you would actually want might be buried among ones you don't,
and some of them don't have much quality control since anyone can put
their designs up. Sites that are more artist centric that have high
quality art prints, such as DeviantArt or Society 6, do offer cards
with some of the types of art we want to feature, but they're often
sold as blank stationary cards and usually in packs. We want to
collaborate with artists to create 'complete' greeting cards with
text and design as well as art, and sell them individually, which is
a different and more specific focus than what many of the available
companies and services offer. 

So,
it's 'that time of year,' isn't it? Can I order some Christmas/New
Years cards from you?
There
will be one or two holiday cards in the initial batch of cards, but I
literally mean one or two. Due to the timing of the campaign, by the
time the cards are in full production, it will be mid-january and too
late for the holiday season. For those that donate early enough and
would prefer getting a holiday card as their “thank you card”
I'll try to send those a little early before the campaign actually
ends, but I can't guarantee you'll receive anything in time for
Christmas/New Years.  

Besides
that, since we're just getting started, we're going to avoid making
many holiday cards during our first year; instead focusing on cards
that sell year round like birthday cards, thank you cards, sympathy
cards, etc. This is because if we were to make a lot of cards for
something like Valentine's Day, then any of the cards we don't manage
to sell in time for the holiday will be unsellable for a whole year
until it rolls around again. As a new company just getting off the
ground, we can't afford to sit on a large pile of unsellable stock
(yet) Once we achieve more stable sales, then we can afford to
produce a better selection of 'limited time' cards. That said, we
will still have a small selection for upcoming holidays, so when you
cash in your perks that include cards, there will be a few choices
for Valentine's day cards you can pick. I can guarantee at least one
since we already have a Valentine's day card in the sample pictures
on this very campaign. 

I'm
an artist and I am interested in making cards with you. How can I
apply/join?
	Just
shoot us an email or message expressing your interest with a link to
an online gallery or portfolio of your work, or check out our job
posting on the DeviantArt and ConceptArt job forums. We are hiring on
a freelance/contract basis and will pay you per piece of art. We will
consider every genre of art, both digital and traditional, and they
don't necessarily have to be anime/comic/game styles of art,
especially if you have a unique style that isn't the kind of thing
you'd see on the 'generic' greeting cards at stores. We will also
consider writers who are interested in writing for cards. 

	We
are already hiring right now, even as the campaign is running.
Artists will be selected based on the quality of their work and
professionalism. Initially we are aiming for a diverse line-up of
cards so priority will go towards recruiting artists with a very wide
variety of styles,  and we will continually hire more artists as the
budget expands. 

I'm
a retailer and want to sell your cards at my store/booth. How can I
become a re-seller?
Send
us an e-mail and we can try to negotiate an arrangement that works
for you. We don't have a full re-seller's program or set wholesale
prices yet. The “early adopter” wholesale perks are currently the
lowest wholesale prices we can safely promise at our current level,
but if we are able to exceed stretch goals we may be able to lower it
further thanks to bulk printing. If you get in early and we're able
to lower the price later, we'll try to cut you some kind of special
discount or deal (like timed exclusive cards or something similar) to
thank you for sticking with us right from the beginning!
As
a customer, where will I be able to buy these cards?
We
will be opening an online store, where anyone in the world can order
Geekigrams cards to be shipped to them. In addition, since the people
behind Geekigrams already travel around the East Coast convention
circuit, we will get dealer's room booths at conventions such as
Anime Boston, Otakon, Katsucon, Connecticon, AnimeNext, etc. We would
also like to form partnerships with retailers, so it's possible that
you may one day be able to buy them at your local comic or hobby
store, but at this stage that is not a promise we can guarantee. 

What
is the deal with this 'resale' program you keep mentioning? It's
sounding awfully 'big business' of you. 

	The
only reason I'm so enthusiastic about it, is that getting such a
resale program in place could make it possible for you to walk into
your local store and buy one of our cards right then and there,
without having to deal with shipping fees and wait times. Honestly,
we'll make more profit off selling cards directly, but greeting cards
are often things that are bought on impulse or at the last minute, so
we'd love to make that a possibility. That goes doubly if we get
international partners who can do all the importing and save you from the international shipping costs. That's all there is to it. 

I
have this really great idea for a card! Can I submit it to you?
For
legal reasons, I would recommend you do not, unless you've already
worked out some kind of contract/agreement with us as writer/artist.
We will not accept unsolicited card ideas because if we take a
suggestion and wind up using it or something similar, and the person
later tries to claim copyright on it, then that creates a legal
dispute. That said, that applies to specific card ideas. If you have
general suggestions like “I want more cards with anime styled art”
or “Way too many cards have anime style art, more western comic art
please!” or “My best friend is a huge fan of _______, can you
make some cards about _________?” we are always open to general
feedback.  

Specifically,
what subject matter will your cards deal with? Will you have cards
about [your hobby or geeky interest goes here]? I don't see anything
like that on the samples on this page.
Keep
in mind, the few samples on this page were done on a VERY limited
budget, (hence the need for this campaign) so they don't cover
anything close to all the subjects and styles I would ultimately like
to cover. Anime, Sci-fi, Comics, Games, Fantasy, Books, D&D,
Steampunk, Internet, Math/Science, Role-playing, Pixel art, and
pretty much everything of geeky/nerdy interest. And like I said in
the previous answer, we're wide open to feedback so let us know what
you'd like to see and we'll look into getting it done for you. 

So,
are these cards ONLY for geeky/nerdy people?
	Not
at all, and most definitely yes. That is squarely my target audience,
but it's not like you're going to have to take some kind of “geek
cred” test to buy them. With the growing popularity of things that
fall under a geeky domain, even if you're not a self labeled 'geek,'
I still think you'll be able to find something that will appeal to
you or a loved one. Have you ever enjoyed movies/shows like The
Avengers, Game of Thrones, Star Wars/Trek or Lord of the Rings? Read
Harry Potter? Played pretty much any video game ever? I'm sure we'll
have something you can appreciate. 
It doesn't necessarily take a 'geek' to appreciate a 'The Walking Dead' reference or a zombie joke like the card above. A fan of tv dramas or a horror movie buff will do. 
To
borrow an example of another business with “geek” in the name, go
check out ThinkGeek's online store. They also have a geeky target
audience, but they also have plenty of cool random gadgets and gifts
that non geeky people would still appreciate. I believe Geekigrams
will be similar in that regard.

Hello you,
In 2012, we imagined a place where artists, writers and researchers would think and make works on the spot, while swimming, sleeping and chatting. These people would forget their daily operations, gather in nature to explore special signs of the physical world through data, dreams, feelings, knowledge, light and sounds. This gathering materialized under the banner of, the Eternal Internet Brotherhood and already passed from the mythological island of, Anafi in Greece, to the rainforest of the surrealist park, of Las Pozas in Mexico.
We become slaves to our clicks and likes. We become stuck on specific modes of thought and behavior. Unfocused and distracted, we swim in an uncontrollable flow of information pollution. Each stroke a meaningless lethargic interaction, a poke here, a favorite there. Through a lack of temptation to the unknown, the biggest global selling merchandize ever is our attention.
Plato spoke about the cave. The imprisoned subject in the cave, should cast her eye outside the cave and forget the shadows inside. Our screens and our cities have become our caves,  its not just the internet, but all our habits and social compromises combined.
 Yes corporate media junk colonized the internet. Its time we start a healing process. Lets re-occupy nature and share horizons. Lets make our own neoliberal, non-economy of sharing nothing and everything. Lets get lost!!
 The upcoming 3rd edition of the Eternal Internet Brotherhood, will take place in the politically conflicted, but physically therapeutic, Dead Sea area in Israel /Palestine, the first ten days of April 2014. Under the guidance of this therapeutic, desolate conflicted natural setting we will continue expanding limits of togetherness, and we will work on a new information and emotional interface. The energy of this environment will empower our minds and bodies. In this direct IRL format, we will process ritualistic themes of communication, done with the spirit of conviviality, corporeality and connectivity. We will work freely with different expressions from arts to science to poetry to health wellbeing, endurance ultrasound survival, esoteric lazer show spectacular, silent foreverness.
The Eternal Internet Brotherhood is an independent crowd-funded project gathering spectacular. 
If you give money it will be much more fun!

A couple of years ago, I was making decent money selling my miniature cat and coffee themed art on online auction sites. It was a great experience for an art school dropout like me to sell art to people all over the world. But when I left an unhealthy, threatening relationship and became a single mom, I had to step up and work overtime to support a child on one income.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">— African traditional arts are performance-based;
in their full aesthetics they transcend media boundaries, integrating plastic
art, music, dance, costumes, and other elements. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">— Western museum conventions typically
disrupt these aesthetics by displaying African objects in isolation and in
stasis.<span style="""">  </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">— Museum displays often similarly obscure the
modern history and social dimensions of African arts.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">— Guinean performing artists are best
qualified to present the arts and heritage of their country to the widest
possible audiences.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">— Contemporary producers of traditional-style
masks need not be labeled “tourist artists” or “forgers” while only older
objects are deemed “authentic.”<span style="""">  </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">— Digital media and projection design are

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">For
those involved in Guinean arts, you know how rarely master artists converge for
a single performance, much less an ongoing collaboration.<span style="""">  </span>For most Guinean artists today, making
a living means teaching classes—and we are all greatly enriched as a
result!<span style="""">  </span>At the same time, we feel
it is important to build a forum for Guinean artists to work collectively, in
cooperation with US museums and other institutions, to present the broader
history and aesthetics of their traditions.<span style="""">  </span>In class we often ask, “Where does this dance come from?”<span style="""">  </span>This project opens the door to an
in-depth response…</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">For
those who don’t know Guinean arts but who know us, and know about our
involvement with African arts from our high school days through our current
doctoral studies, this project may best be framed as an effort to reconcile
creative experience and specialized knowledge—i.e., to make academic work
publicly relevant and accessible.<span style=""""> 
</span>It also aims to increase the visibility of Guinean arts, not only in
terms of greater exposure, but also in the sense of greater aesthetic and
historical visibility.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">If
this all sounds fair enough but you’ve actually never heard about the arts of Guinea,
please don’t take our word for it!<span style=""""> 
</span>We’ll be uploading images, information, and performance clips over the
course of the campaign, so you can get an idea of what it’s all about.</span></p>

— African traditional arts are performance-based;
in their full aesthetics they transcend media boundaries, integrating plastic
art, music, dance, costumes, and other elements. 
 
— Western museum conventions typically
disrupt these aesthetics by displaying African objects in isolation and in
stasis.  
 
— Museum displays often similarly obscure the
modern history and social dimensions of African arts.
 
— Guinean performing artists are best
qualified to present the arts and heritage of their country to the widest
possible audiences.
 
— Contemporary producers of traditional-style
masks need not be labeled “tourist artists” or “forgers” while only older
objects are deemed “authentic.”  
 
— Digital media and projection design are
useful for historicizing and contextualizing the arts of Guinea via archival
footage, interviews, etc.
 
 
WHAT’S IN CONTRIBUTING
Your
contributions fund a crucial first step: an intro event in New York City in
2011 featuring performance, film installation, art display, and speakers and
discussions on the contemporary situation surrounding Guinean arts and culture.
 
This
event will serve as a public platform for introducing the project.  It will also enable us to gather more
funding and support, first through ticket sales and direct donations, and then
through an extensive process of applying to grants and contacting sponsors.
 
Contributions
to the present campaign go towards paying the artists—musicians, dancers, and griots trained in Guinea’s
post-independence “ballet” tradition—who will perform at the event.  Contributions also will cover the
purchase and editing of archival footage to be screened at the event, and will
pay for transport costs and other expenses associated with displaying several
fine objects from collections around the city.
 
 
WHY CONTRIBUTE
For
those involved in Guinean arts, you know how rarely master artists converge for
a single performance, much less an ongoing collaboration.  For most Guinean artists today, making
a living means teaching classes—and we are all greatly enriched as a
result!  At the same time, we feel
it is important to build a forum for Guinean artists to work collectively, in
cooperation with US museums and other institutions, to present the broader
history and aesthetics of their traditions.  In class we often ask, “Where does this dance come from?”  This project opens the door to an
in-depth response…
 
For
those who don’t know Guinean arts but who know us, and know about our
involvement with African arts from our high school days through our current
doctoral studies, this project may best be framed as an effort to reconcile
creative experience and specialized knowledge—i.e., to make academic work
publicly relevant and accessible. 
It also aims to increase the visibility of Guinean arts, not only in
terms of greater exposure, but also in the sense of greater aesthetic and
historical visibility.
 
If
this all sounds fair enough but you’ve actually never heard about the arts of Guinea,
please don’t take our word for it! 
We’ll be uploading images, information, and performance clips over the
course of the campaign, so you can get an idea of what it’s all about.
 
 
DONATIONS
If
you have any questions, either about the project or the process of donating
online, please feel free to contact us. 
The intention is to provoke thoughts and questions, so we welcome them!
 
If
your questions are more on the financial side (perhaps you are students like we
are), we ask you to consider contributing at the smallest level!  Every donation counts!   
 
 
OTHER WAYS TO HELP
Please
share this announcement widely via email, Facebook, etc.!  The more people in the loop, the
better!
 
And
you may also like to contribute in different ways—for example with suggestions,
with performance images or footage, or with other things we can’t think of… but
you will!
 
 
OUR THANKS
… in
advance for your consideration and support!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Craig Erskine and I am a 48 year old artist, who trained at the School of Visual Arts in New York in my youth. I am actively working on creating a series of wildlife etchings - capturing the spirit of each animal in detailed hand etched line on plexiglass or Lexan. I would love to produce hand etched prints of 10 animals that have captured our imagination and our hearts. What I have done thus far has been due to the kindness of a friend and I do not wish to continue to press his kindness for my gain. Please help raise money for a suitable etching press and supplies to make this worth while creative venture a reality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to achieve this goal I need a solid well built etching press, blankets and bed as well as inks, plates and other miscellaneous materials. The press alone can run upwards of 18,000$ - I am asking for less than 20% of that and will buy a press according to the budget afforded to me here as well as the blankets (170$) and the Bed (180$). The Plexiglass panels are relatively cheap but the more durable Lexan can be double the price. Inks, papers and other materials costs are a small percentage of the whole. The simple fact is the more I can generate through this effort the better the quality of the materials and the greater the outcome of the work.</p>
<p>Thank you's are great but often not enough, I will send each of you prints from the series as they are created. As the donations get larger so will the print sizes and at certain levels I will go in and hand embelish the prints making limited edition AP proofs especially for you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By getting the materials to make this happen I can continue to develop and create artistically with relevant meaningful subject matter like this wildlife series. As an artist it is important to contribute our abilities and awareness to futher our understanding beyond words. That is the job of the artist and that is the potential impact.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Understanding that not all who care can contribute, I ask that you talk to your friends and let them know what I am trying to do and how you believe it is a worthy cause. I will say in advance a heartfelt Thank You!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>     Hi! My name is Renita Orellana, and I'm a freelance graphic designer, game artist, and craftswoman based in Gunnison CO. I've got a bachelor of media arts and animation degree from The Art Institute of Seattle, and I'm currently working on a master of the arts in teaching degree at Western State University of Colorado. Art, in all of its forms, has always been my passion. I love learning new crafts, trades, and techniques.</p>
<p>     I've recently made myself a beautiful, fun sketchbook. I would love the opportunity to share this creation with other creative minds. Many of my friends have already shown interest in my sketchbook. However, I don't have the funds to buy the initial supplies needed to produce the initial batch of books. </p>
<p>     By contributing to my campaign, or helping spread the word, you will help a starving artist get her feet off the ground. You would fund the making of the first batch of sketch books, and the procedes from that will fund making more if the demand lasts. Basically, you'd give me the boost I need to become more self reliant.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>     I am aiming for $500 in funding. </p>
<ul>
<li>$100 of that will go towards buying a set of liquid watercolor paints, some acrylic paints, and a matte finishing spray. Those paints will last me for many sketchbooks, even after the initial batch.</li>
<li>$200 will be used to buy canvas, board for backing, rubber adhesive to make the sketch pad, and lots of paper. This initial purchase of the most basic components (canvas, board, adhesive, paper) will produce an estimated initial 30 sketch books.</li>
<li>$100 of the funding I am reserving to spend promoting my Etsy shop, which I'll be using to sell my product.</li>
<li>The last $100 represents the buffer-zone, covering Indiegogo fees, and in case I did my math terribly wrong, or if shipping is especially pricey. </li>
</ul>
<p>     If I don't reach my goal of $500, any funding recieved will still go towards producing the first batch of sketchbooks. If I exceed my funding goal, the extra funds will go towards designing my ""sketch book back pack,"" which is a back pack that unfolds into a sketch book, or further advertising my Etsy shop.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Art Crasher?</strong></h3>
<p><span>Art Crasher is all about YOU, the artist. Art Crasher promotes and exposes new and upcoming artists on artcrasher.com. Each month Art Crasher has an online art show which features five galleries on the site. The five galleries are ""Photography"", ""Visual/Painting"", ""Off the Canvas (installation art)"", ""Video"" and ""Street Art"" (coming in November 2012). </span></p>
<p><span>Art Crasher also includes interviews with more established artists and ""Spotlight"". The interviews provide advice for new artists and let them know how to get a foot into the art world and how to gain more exposure. Art Crasher places one artist in the ""Spotlight"" each month. The ""Spotlight"" features an interview and solo gallery of 20-30 pieces.  </span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485880597/lpvquonwcwr9f6joiu8o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Our stretch goal, at the $800 mark, is this sexy Cesare card! </strong></h3>
<p>As a trading card publisher, I've used my relationships in the comic book industry (I've been a historian and journalist for twenty years) to create indie card sets using Mike Allred's <i>Madman</i> (in 3D!) and <i>G-Men from Hell</i>; the toy line <i>Amazing Heroes</i>, the silent film <i>Nosferatu</i>, and my own comics history set <i>Four Color.</i> I love trading cards and am doing my darnedest to fill the void the major companies aren't looking to. With my <i>Nosferatu</i> card set, I donated several extra packs to a local movie house here in Richmond, The Bijou; I plan on doing the same with <i>Caligari</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$13 gets you the 13-card <i>Caligari </i>set, while $23 gets you the cards plus a limited-to-Indie GoGo metal card (image of which is below). My creative goal with this set (I set a different one each card set I do) is to design a silent film card set that is not only reflective of silent film, but also Caligari's unique Expressionist aesthetic.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484342398/ifmcqkhagtpawxvbru02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My higher levels include a combination set with the limited <i>Nosferatu </i>run, and even a full level that includes all of the cards I've published. There's even a level to get your own ""silent film card"" designed by myself and at a print run of 250.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484342439/pzbdlnz7ksv3cxoxdgza.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The $500 covers both production for the limited print run of 250, as well as postage to send packs out to backers. I'm a sucker for stretch goals and have some in mind for when we push past the initial goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is not my first card set: I have an established and reliable printer and am determined to give nothing less than a quality trading card set in all my campaigns. You'll not only get this unique and limited way to relive the silent masterpiece of horror, but you'll also be part of a community of card lovers and collectors I call my friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are somethings that are as unforeseeable as a crazy somnambulist, such as freak weather, shipping mishaps, or corrupted image files. I've been through a few of those with my past campaigns and have always come out in the end. Since you will be producing this set with me, I will keep you up-to-date through both thick and thin.</p>

Our stretch goal, at the $800 mark, is this sexy Cesare card! 
As a trading card publisher, I've used my relationships in the comic book industry (I've been a historian and journalist for twenty years) to create indie card sets using Mike Allred's Madman (in 3D!) and G-Men from Hell; the toy line Amazing Heroes, the silent film Nosferatu, and my own comics history set Four Color. I love trading cards and am doing my darnedest to fill the void the major companies aren't looking to. With my Nosferatu card set, I donated several extra packs to a local movie house here in Richmond, The Bijou; I plan on doing the same with Caligari.

What We Need & What You Get
$13 gets you the 13-card Caligari set, while $23 gets you the cards plus a limited-to-Indie GoGo metal card (image of which is below). My creative goal with this set (I set a different one each card set I do) is to design a silent film card set that is not only reflective of silent film, but also Caligari's unique Expressionist aesthetic.

My higher levels include a combination set with the limited Nosferatu run, and even a full level that includes all of the cards I've published. There's even a level to get your own ""silent film card"" designed by myself and at a print run of 250.

The $500 covers both production for the limited print run of 250, as well as postage to send packs out to backers. I'm a sucker for stretch goals and have some in mind for when we push past the initial goal.

The Impact
This is not my first card set: I have an established and reliable printer and am determined to give nothing less than a quality trading card set in all my campaigns. You'll not only get this unique and limited way to relive the silent masterpiece of horror, but you'll also be part of a community of card lovers and collectors I call my friends.

Risks & Challenges
There are somethings that are as unforeseeable as a crazy somnambulist, such as freak weather, shipping mishaps, or corrupted image files. I've been through a few of those with my past campaigns and have always come out in the end. Since you will be producing this set with me, I will keep you up-to-date through both thick and thin.

<b>Who am I?</b> <br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Chrystal Powell. I am a metal art jeweler currently residing in San Francisco. I hold a a BFA in sculpture from AAU and am the mother of a 10 month old incredibly cute baby named River. Enfolding the idea that jewelry can fulfill roles beyond that of adornment, I use precious metals, natural minerals, and otherworldly allusions to construct pieces that are intended to serve the wearer; function as fashion accoutrements, wearable sculptures and objects of power.</p>
<p>Due to the need for more space, and a job change for my partner and 
child’s father- our family is relocating from San Francisco to Petaluma 
this Winter. I have collected many tools over the years, but <i>I do not 
currently own the vast majority of the tools and pieces of equipment I 
use on a daily basis.</i><br/></p>
<p><b>It is my goal to raise $6,000 to directly fund the acquisition of tools and equipment to outfit a metal-shop that will secure my ability to make my work and to teach my craft to others. Most of these tools will last beyond the entirety of my lifetime. You can help make this happen and get fine handcrafted jewelry  in the process!<br/></b></p>
<p>The tools will equip me with the long-term capacity to create from an operable, organized shop. I will be enabled to use standard production procedures to efficiently create works of wearable art- and be afforded the opportunity to pursue this craft as a business that will support my family. I would greatly appreciate your support at this time.<br/></p>
<h3>What this campaign is about and why it’s important to me:  </h3>
<p> For the past decade, I’ve worked in collective studio spaces, alongside uncountable gifted artists and craftspeople who also make jewelry and sculpture. These spaces have been operable, due to vast and shared resources. It’s been a gift to work in communities like these; hubs harboring tools, skill-shares and constructive feedback. I am beyond grateful for these experiences- but feel it is essential to my craft and work that I create a functioning studio of my own- proximal to my home, where I can focus on my work with tools and equipment that are organized, available and in well working order. <br/></p>
<p>This campaign is an effort to get a shop setup in our new town and residence where I can resume creative and business operations without a gigantic pause caused by the need to raise funds in some other way. You get handmade fine art jewelry, I'll get to keep working, we all win!<br/></p>
<h4>My History: <br/>
</h4>
<p>Early last year, I was living in the basement of a 16 person live/work arts collective in the Mission District of San Francisco, Million Fishes. Months before, I had quit my 10 year long stint as a waitress and bartender to focus solely on developing my artistic craft, and to pour my efforts into growing this craft into a sustainable business. I balanced my earnings from art jewelry sales, with teaching classes and workshops in metal-smithing to adults and middle school aged kids. </p>
<p>Things were working. My business goals were set and I was on the road to acheiving them, when I became pregnant with my first child. Motherhood, among all of its hormonal, physical and mental shiftings, has deeply transformed my focus and vision for my artwork. I have never felt more clear and committed to the power and possibility that is the metal art jewelry I make.<br/>As the birth of my son let me in to the understanding of my power as a woman, I have also been overtaken with passion, commitment and clarity to the power of my artwork. It is my goal to move forward with a comprehensive business plan ( that was put on hold for River's incubation and arrival), that will allow me to support our family with my craft.  <br/>I want my son to learn that success is possible and probable in the world when a person aligns themselves with what they come to understand as ""their work."" The wearable sculpture that I make, is ""my work"" in the world. I am asking for your support to continue on my quest in its development and potential for its reach, while enabling me to support my family financially, physically and emotionally.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>The magnitude of what you can help me achieve is immeasurable: </h4>
<p>One person can make small things happen- I have always practiced and believed that with the support of community- the dreams of many can grow exponentially. I am turning to you- my community and yours too- to help me grow my dreams at this turning point in my life and practice. <br/><b><br/>Here are a few ways in which your contribution will impact my work: </b><br/></p>
<ul><li>In ten minutes, I can cause fabricated edges of a hollow form to meet with a belt sander; a process I can finish by hand in over an hour. </li></ul>
<ul><li>With a rolling mill, I can recycle my scrap metal into plates and wires from which I can create new work.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>With a rolling mill, I can create veins of texture on wings, experiment and imprint imagery sourced from my own etchings onto metal, in minutes. </li></ul>
<ul><li>With a tumbler, I can clean 30 silver hummingbird castings in 30 minutes- a process that would take me 3 full days of work.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>With a buffing machine, I can efficiently polish and finish pieces in minutes, that would otherwise require hours and hours of labor to take to a finished level- understanding that the level of finishing I'm interested in just wouldn't be possible with out this machine. <br/>
</li>
<li>With dapping blocks and anvils, I can create the bulbous, organic and hollow forms I work to construct efficiently- these are necessary and vital tools for these processes.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My work will thrive in a studio where I can choose from correct tools to do the correct job- rather than spending valuable time reinventing my process and pieces so that I can create with the small amount of tools I currently own.</p>
<p><b>Essentially: Outfitting my shop with these tools will allow me to move forward in my practice. I will keep creating, teaching and walking down the path of the artist, while being able to support my family.<br/></b><br/></p>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p><b>The Breakdown:</b><br/>Electrical equipment for preparing, polishing and finishing metal; hand tools to form, move and secure metal; and tools for precision fabrication and soldering: <br/><br/>ELECTRICAL– $1,613<br/>Polisher/buffer (Baldor) Dust collector, bowl tumbler, Grizzly belt/disc sander<br/><br/>HAND TOOLS- $2,080<br/>engraver's block, rolling mill, ring reducer/stretcher/englarer, wire gauges, chasing tools, dapping set, ring mandrel, oval bracelet, round bracelet<br/>steel block, necklace mandrel, hoop mandrel, bezel mandrel, 100lb anvil<br/><br/>SOLDERING/PRECISION/PRODUCTION- $2,307<br/>Micro Minismith, finger gauge, 1propane tank, 1 oxygen tank, tripod, charcoal blocks, third hand- 2, pickle+pot, optivisor, diamond grinder glass saw, tube cutter, sinusoidal stake 4"", round disc cutter, miter-cutting vise</p>
<p><br/>Totaling: $6,000<br/><br/>These tools and pieces of equipment will allow me to create using the standard production procedures with which I currently teach and practice.<br/><br/>Any funds that either exceed my goal or are leftover from finding tools on sale/used in great working condition, I will use to purchase raw materials such as sterling silver and rubber mold material to produce my upcoming limited production line of jewelry.  <br/></p>
<p>My many years experience in production houses, private studios and learning institutions informs my understanding for how to outfit and operate a full shop. I appreciate your help in making this happen!<br/><br/></p>

with artists, developmental organizations and communities to create meaningful
and inspirational public art projects. We believe everyone should have the opportunity to create and experience art, especially youth. We think art allows people to express themselves and can make people happier and healthier. We think public art has the ability to transform a space and positively impact a community. For our first project, we're traveling to Gigante, a small village in Nicaragua, to create a mural with the local youth group and Health Committee on the newly constructed Community Health Center. Our partner nonprofit, Project WOO, has led the Health Committee in developing the Center after a community census in Gigante identified access to community health as the village's biggest need. 
Until now, the closest clinic was 15 kilometers away. A
doctor comes to visit the village every 2 weeks, seeing patients in a church
with less than adequate conditions. The community was in need of their own
clinic that offered privacy, running water, electricity, and comfort. The Gigante Health Committee wants the Center to be bright and happy, encouraging locals to get the access to the health services and education they need in an inviting atmosphere. We will concept the mural with the local youth group, people of Gigante and our partners before inviting all to participate in the painting of the mural. Our goal is to create something meaningful for the community with the community, something we hope strengthens the success of the Center. Very Perky! Paintings, Prints & MoreThe great thing about creating an art campaign is we have A LOT of amazing art as perks! Prints, original paintings, and eco-friendly iPhone cases.  All art by Erik Abel.

We are raising $5000 to cover the cost of our trip. This will cover our art supplies (paint, paint brushes, tarps, tape, buckets, etc) and the cost of our travel to/from Nicaragua and lodging it Gigante. Additional funds raised will be donated between nonprofits: 
Project Woo and Surf for Life to support their existing and upcoming development projects in Central America (half of extra funds raised after our goal)

 Our Story We started the Abel Arts Collective after working with several nonprofits to raise money for their humanitarian and environmental causes through donations from Erik Abel's art. While we loved giving back through donations, we wanted to pursue a more hands on project that was centered around the positive impacts art creates and find a way for other artists to do the same. So, we started our own organization that will allow people everywhere to experience the joy in creating art and the benefits public art offers to a community. This project in Nicaragua is our pilot, using Erik as our guinea pig to determine the best way to coordinate philanthropic art projects before bringing other artists in the future. We've partnered with Project WOO and Surf for Life, two merging nonprofits that work across Central America.

West Virginia is one of the last places that people think about when it comes to creating horror based arts and films. If we do not receive additional funding we cannot take on such a large project. This photo set will feature 10 actors/actresses/models from West Virginia. For most of them it is their modeling debut. We are working with local people who love what we do and really want to be involved in the project.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $200.00, and anything beyond that will go toward making Dirt Candy even more awesome. This money will go into latex, blood, witchcraft props, and costuming. We will be creating/sewing them ourselves and creating 75% of the props. <br/></p>

I'm an illustrator who grew up in the small town of Carbondale, CO. I attended The Art Institute Of Colorado and was unable to finish due to financial circumstances  beyond my control. However I continued as an an artist and am pursuing it as my profession and lifestyle.  I currently reside in Golden Co along with my husband,  Van Fischer , and our two Toddlers,  Fawkes (5) and Rowan(3). Where I work as a freelance illustrator, Portrait artist and craftswoman, and My husband is employed in Digital Signage and is a freelance Animator.I enjoy working on projects that range from children’s books and fantasy illustration, to realistic portraiture. I draw upon inspiration from my own life stories and inspirations, along with nature, mythology, folklore, and fairy tales, my artwork tends to take on an imaginative and dream world feeling, full of detail,  and with occasional modern elements.Even more so I enjoy sharing my artwork with the world and that's what this campaign is about!THE CAMPAIGNRAW: Natural born Artists http://www.rawartists.org/taraseren recently invited me to participate in their June Showcase in Boulder on June 29th, 2013. The showcase is a single night event in Boulder, Co at the historic Absinthe House Venue! Where a selection of artists have the opportunity to showcase and sell their work without RAW taking any commission of the sales.RAW is a independent arts organization, for artists, by artists, who encourage the creative success of the many visionaries and storytellers of our generation.THE IMPACT & FUNDING NEEDSPart of what makes art so valuable and so full of impact is its ability to speak to, and be experienced by a variety of people across all walks of life and even time. The RAW initiative is funded by ticket sales, so for artists to participate they have to commit to selling 20 tickets to the show and that's where you come in. By supporting this campaign you are making it possible for me to participate in the show. WHY $600?To be in the show I have to sell 20 tickets or raise $300 in sponsorship, the remaining $300 will go towards framing for the artwork that will be in the show, Supplies to create Dream Catchers and Dream Catcher sculpture in works to show, We are asked to supply some of our own lighting and hanging hardware and tools.WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE ARTIST?RAW artists do not only get to join the showcase. They are also promoted on the RAW website, they receive a set of professional photos and a video with an interview to use for press releases after the show and also the opportunity to exhibit in one other US city later on. RAW also pulls in local talent scouts in the surrounding area. Its a huge Opportunity for some one like me. Thank YOU!$5USD Hi-res digital wallpaper

<h3>Social Commitment &amp; Art: an inseparable duo</h3>
<p>Fondazione Venezia – Servizi alla Persona was founded in 2014 as an institution that provides welfare services, and has as vision, the health of people who have to deal with situations of weakness and reduced autonomy. </p>
<p>The priority of the Institute is to provide people the best quality of life possible in relation to their mental and physical health through the respect of the actual context in which they live.</p>
<p>Considered that old connection between social engagement and cultural commitment, Fondazione Venezia – Servizi alla Persona decides to follow the management of cultural and artistic heritage of great value, property of IRE.</p>
<p>As in the past we used to decorate the seats allocated to welfare and charity with the work of the great masters, so the Foundation believes that today it is right to pursue the enhancement of masterpieces of artists that once decorated those places. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450439502/tjhiy9z3pmmmev3zylag.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This operation begins with the reopening to the public of the Scala Contarini del Bovolo. Thanks to the latest renovation, whose preliminary draft was designed by the architect Paolo Faccio, this architectural gem has regained its former glory and it is now ready to be reunited with the surrounding urban context.</p>
<p>The restitution of these goods to the community is essential for their conservation and promotion: through its use, public art found its sense of accomplishment, because art is inseparable from the enjoyment of the beholder and from the joy of who is enhanced by it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Scala Contarini del Bovolo, the hidden treasure of Venice</h3>
<p>Hidden in a maze of streets and canals, very close to Campo Manin, along one of the main tourist routes in Venice (railway – Academy), appears an architectural gem characterized by a style that is among Renaissance, Gothic and Byzantine: the Scala Contarini del Bovolo .</p>
<p>The spiral staircase most impressive and valuable in Venice is a perfect synthesis of different styles: Renaissance (for the use of some elements such as the capitals), Gothic (for the construction technique) and Venetian-Byzantine (for the form).</p>

<p>It was commissioned by Pietro Contarini probably around the end of 1400 in order to decorate the facade of the adjacent Palace of San Paternian owned by an illustrious Venetian family. The realization of this work, in fact, did not have at first a functional purpose, but consisted mainly of an act of prestige and aimed mainly to a further growth in the popularity of the family.</p>
<p>The creation of the scale had such a wide appeal that have led citizens to choose a nickname for that branch of the family for which, since that time has been used the nickname Contarini del Bovolo (referring to the particular shape of the staircase ""to snail shell"" which in Venetian is said precisely ""bovolo"").</p>
<p><b>The palace and the staircase</b></p>
<p>The Palace has known several owners in its long existence; a stylistic examination puts the first constructions in the mid- 1300s, a time when the Doge Andrea Contarini was in charged, one of the most powerful members of the family Contarini Branch San Paternian.</p>
<p>Initially, it was owned by Morosini, later the building was sold to the Contarini as dowry by the marriage of Caterina and Zuanne Contarini Morosini.  Towards the end of 1400 a special spiral staircase built by Pietro Contarini, son of Zuanne and Caterina, probably enriched the palace. It is true that, on the occasion of ""redecima"" in 1514, Pietro Contarini claimed that he was living in a residential house located in San Paternian.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450439581/rzrywgebf0zqtyzziyl3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 1518, the year of his death, Pietro left the property to his daughter Contarina, where she lived with her husband and children. Another member of the family of successive generations will declare to live in the same building. </p>
<p>The ownership of the property remained to the Contarini’s family throughout the eighteenth century, however, gaining the name of Minelli following the marriage between Elisabetta Contarini and Giovanni Minelli. The last heirs of the family Minelli sell their shares to Dominic Emery Toulon.</p>
<p>The palace was coming from a period in which was assigned to Arnaux Marseille called the Maltese who had opened a motel which still derives the name of the street (Calle delle Locande/ Calle of the motels) that leads to arrive to the small square of the Palace .</p>
<p>Since 1849 the property is linked to the ""Foundation Emery"" managed by the Fraternal of the poor of San Luca who assisted the needs of the parish. Since then the history of the building is linked with the story of assistance care in Venice: before the building came under the management of the Congregation of Charity and became the administrative center; then it is transferred to the Institute Manin changing jurisdiction from welfare to recovery.</p>
<p>This step is crucial because it will make that the Palazzo Contarini move to the IRE (Institution for recovery and Education) and will become in the manager of all institutions of refuge around the city.</p>
<p>From 1937, the building will become a branch of ECA (Municipal Assistance Entity) until 1975, the year when the duties of assistance will go to the district; while from 1939 the same will also host the offices of the IRE, that always in the '75 abandon it to leave space for restoration work.</p>
<p>The IRE, in addition to the social function, has a very important cultural function having inherited an artistic and architectural heritage of the ancient charities. During the Serenissima (Republic of Venice), in fact, the art was accompanied by social commitment, beautifying and enriching the different branches of the brotherhoods charitable. In this context we find the work of prominent artists and architects such Longhena for the Church of Beggars and the Church of Ospedaletto, Palladio for the Zitelle Church and Derelitti, Palma the younger for the Oratory of the Crociferi, Jacopo Guarana for frescoes in the Ospedaletto music room, Tiepolo for the Church of Mercy and the Church of Ospedaletto.</p>
<p><b>Who created the staircase?</b></p>
<p>The Scala Contarini del Bovolo was commissioned by Pietro Contarini roughly towards the end of 1400 for reasons of prestige and social success, as a decorative element of the adjacent building, at the time his place of residence. Even today there is nothing certain about the identification of the designer of the staircase, but there are two main hypotheses. </p>
<p>The tradition has attributed the authorship to Giovanni Candi based on some information obtained from his last will and testament. Here, in fact, he appears as a creditor of a large quantity of money against Pietro Contarini. </p>
<p>This first proposal, however, has some limits: firstly, it is not said that Giovanni has its own credit for the construction work of the staircase; secondly, Candi was not named "" architect”, instead it is seen as a ""joiner"", position addressed for a person who perform purely carpentry and joinery, and it seems strange that Contarini had entrusted a work of such great importance to a carpenter. Moreover, in this case, it could be justified some architectural inconsistencies in the construction and that classicism, a bit medieval in the style, still far from the Renaissance consciousness.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450685794/plontmgcvd1zftmigai8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Lea Salvatori Rizzi, in a recent study, advanced in the alternative hypothesis of Giorgio Spavento, an important architect of that time. It seems strange indeed that Contarini had not consulted an expert for a work of such great value. Incidentally Spavento had contact the Contarini of San Paternian for the design of the Church of San Salvador.</p>
<p>There is lack of evidence in relation to the intervention on the building, however there are stylistic similarities by comparison with other works of his creation: as the neo Byzantine character, the precision, the essential decorative without plastic elements and accentuated by the use of brick. In addition to the most significant work of Spavento, the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the architect uses square pillars instead of columns supporting the arches on the ground floor, the choice made for the Scala Contarini del Bovolo. </p>
<p>It is likely that the work was not well seen by the government of Venice for the huge outlay which entailed: interventions of this type, in fact, on one hand the impoverished local economy and on the other hand, the idea of taking some risks creating dangerous competitions between different families. The main cost for the realization of the staircase is due to the materials used: Istrian stone of excellent quality.</p>
<p><b>An architectural gem</b></p>
<p>The property is developed widely in height above the average of the Venetian palaces. This required great technical skills by manufacturers because the property was completely perforated by arches and lodges. In addition there was the need to adapt to an existing building, as well as the problem of unstable foundations due to the peculiarities of the Venetian subsoil. </p>
<p>Another obstacle resulted from the large range of construction, which greatly increased static and architectural difficulties.</p>
<p>The reference to the Tower of Pisa is immediate and we can compare that the technique used does not indicate that the Renaissance conscience, but it is distinguished by an original reinterpretation of classicism. </p>
<p>The staircase is the finest example of the neo- Byzantine Venice: here it was established a New Renaissance, in contrast to the taste of Lombards; Tuscans and Roman trends; and the model of Byzantine Ravenna buildings.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450439642/ukzq8k3e1ja7xphvchmq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Scala Contarini del Bovolo is composed of two sections linked together, a loggia and a cylindrical tower. </p>
<p>The gallery is open to the outside with large Renaissance arches, three per floor and decreasing height so that those on the top floor prove half of those on the ground floor. This trick of perspective gives the work a greater height.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of the staircase is to make the rest of the ground floor arches on square pillars instead of columns. </p>
<p>The cylindrical tower has 26 meters high and has a diameter of 4.70 meters. It sets on a central pillar around which are superimposed 80 monolithic steps that ascend counterclockwise.</p>
<p>The column ends on the top floor with a lookout with decorative Istrian stone. The steps have a trapezoidal shape and end with a ring that slips in the central pin; a layer of molten lead evens the contact surfaces between the various elements. The first flight of stairs rises straight and rests on arches of different sizes and is contained in the first lodge. </p>
<p>The capitals are characterized by a very original cut: the four spirals are connected as many acanthus leaves very simple and with little relief. </p>
<p>A small flight of stairs rebuilt in 800 allows access to the lookout. The wooden roof that is located inside the dome is 1874. Originally it had a lower frame and tiles.</p>
<p>It is important to point out the interior of the helical staircase, the alternation of empty and full of taste, typical Venetian and the contrast between the perforated facing the courtyard and the brick facing of the building. The contrast is given by the surface of the red - brown brick Gothic ancestry and the white of the ribs in Istrian stone.</p>
<p>The spiral staircase most impressive and valuable in Venice is a perfect synthesis of different styles: Renaissance (for the use of some elements such as the capitals), Gothic (for the construction technique) and Venetian-Byzantine (the form).</p>

<h3>The nineteenth-century restorations</h3>
<p>The first restoration works date back to the second half of the 800: the building was in a poor state of conservation and this led to several campaigns of consolidation, also accompanied by distributional changes and reforms of the perforated patterns. </p>
<p>It also intervened at the staircase: the cracked steps were affected by the implementation of grappa iron and damaged the central column was enclosed by a wall pillar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the interventions in the nineteenth-century were gradually canceled by the oxidation of the metal elements and the consequences induced by the static of a hardening masonry pillar, which embraced the middle column of the ladder.  It can be also added the degradation of the stone material.</p>
<p><b>The restoration of the Minnesota Chapter of the Word Monuments Found</b></p>
<p>In 1979, the Minnesota Chapter of the Word Monuments Found financed the restoration of the Scala Contarini del Bovolo in the context of the International Campaign for the Safeguarding of Venice. </p>
<p>The restoration project, developed in 1980 by architect Mario Piana of the Superintendent of Environmental and Architectural Heritage, was entrusted to the Venetian Building of Engineer Todeschini for structural reinforcement, and the company Lithos for intervention on the stone. </p>
<p>This intervention was designed with the idea of restoring the monument to a condition close to the original one, by searching for methods and materials that behave the least possible tampering of historical material. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450439686/ise3lt77chtdwsp6wyeh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The idea is also to remove the causes of the static flow, such as the replacement of the iron clamps as stainless steel elements and the removal of the pillar masonry, finishing with the cleaning and restoration of stone parts. </p>
<p>This restoration won the prize Torta in 1992 for the quality and competence demonstrated in its implementation. </p>
<p><b>The last restoration and restitution to the community</b></p>
<p>The last renovation of Palazzo Contarini by the Institute of Recovery and Education has provided a unique opportunity to return to the usability of the staircase security most beautiful in the world. </p>
<p>The drafting of the final project dates back to 2006 and the executive to 2009.</p>
<p>The project for Palazzo Contarini del Bovolo was based on studies and very advanced analysis. </p>
<p>In relation to the investigations carried out, it was possible to identify some internal partitions and ceilings made ​​recently that deprive the spaces of their characters, complicating the paths and creating a disadvantage position in the perception of the space. The project involved the elimination of these elements in order to redefine the redistribution of routes and to find more consistency.</p>
<p>It was ensured a clear division of the entrances and the spaces between IRE, City of Venice and the area open to visitors, a distinction also determined by security issues.</p>
<p>The intervention consists mainly in a new staircase connecting all floors of the IRE, placed in the other side of the Palace; in order to do this, it has been studied a finishing touch that recalls the materials of the lagoon through the transparency and the colors of blown glass sheets supported by a metal structure which also contains the elevator shaft.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450439723/i6wmyiitc8cfzjkzlj8p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The construction of the new staircase meets functional requirements, it is characterized as new and distinctive element of the restoration and aims to evoke some materials and counterpoint between the Palace and the outdoor staircase. Also the distribution of the structure was the most conservative possible of the existing construction, identifying two main distribution plans.</p>
<p>The interventions of consolidation of the horizontal planes are summarized in conditions of deformability and the increase of some elements. Structural improvements resulting from combined actions such as the reduction of the light through the onboard network, the increase of rigidity with reinforcements with double plank and plank nails, and replacement with wood restorations. The horizontal planes such stiffened have been linked to the perimeter walls with metal chains isolated and profile system steel whose purpose was to distribute stress on the masonry. In case, it has found valuable elements, consolidation solutions have been abandoned in favor of conservation. The other interventions were more conservatives: the identification, preservation, and integration of historic finishes (especially some decorations dating back to the early stages of the building that they encounter while on the external elevation at the staircase), the security and consolidation of all stone elements. </p>
<p>The construction site was an important moment of knowledge of the Palace, whose future preservation can refer to material collected and processed; these insights have also addressed some design choices, related for example to highlight some past phases of the construction of the Palace. </p>
<p>Additionally, this last intervention has given back to the Scala Contarini its main function: it has constituted a <i>chance</i> to give utility to a <i>unique work.</i>

Social Commitment & Art: an inseparable duo
Fondazione Venezia – Servizi alla Persona was founded in 2014 as an institution that provides welfare services, and has as vision, the health of people who have to deal with situations of weakness and reduced autonomy. 
The priority of the Institute is to provide people the best quality of life possible in relation to their mental and physical health through the respect of the actual context in which they live.
Considered that old connection between social engagement and cultural commitment, Fondazione Venezia – Servizi alla Persona decides to follow the management of cultural and artistic heritage of great value, property of IRE.
As in the past we used to decorate the seats allocated to welfare and charity with the work of the great masters, so the Foundation believes that today it is right to pursue the enhancement of masterpieces of artists that once decorated those places. 


This operation begins with the reopening to the public of the Scala Contarini del Bovolo. Thanks to the latest renovation, whose preliminary draft was designed by the architect Paolo Faccio, this architectural gem has regained its former glory and it is now ready to be reunited with the surrounding urban context.
The restitution of these goods to the community is essential for their conservation and promotion: through its use, public art found its sense of accomplishment, because art is inseparable from the enjoyment of the beholder and from the joy of who is enhanced by it.


Scala Contarini del Bovolo, the hidden treasure of Venice
Hidden in a maze of streets and canals, very close to Campo Manin, along one of the main tourist routes in Venice (railway – Academy), appears an architectural gem characterized by a style that is among Renaissance, Gothic and Byzantine: the Scala Contarini del Bovolo .
The spiral staircase most impressive and valuable in Venice is a perfect synthesis of different styles: Renaissance (for the use of some elements such as the capitals), Gothic (for the construction technique) and Venetian-Byzantine (for the form).


It was commissioned by Pietro Contarini probably around the end of 1400 in order to decorate the facade of the adjacent Palace of San Paternian owned by an illustrious Venetian family. The realization of this work, in fact, did not have at first a functional purpose, but consisted mainly of an act of prestige and aimed mainly to a further growth in the popularity of the family.
The creation of the scale had such a wide appeal that have led citizens to choose a nickname for that branch of the family for which, since that time has been used the nickname Contarini del Bovolo (referring to the particular shape of the staircase ""to snail shell"" which in Venetian is said precisely ""bovolo"").
The palace and the staircase
The Palace has known several owners in its long existence; a stylistic examination puts the first constructions in the mid- 1300s, a time when the Doge Andrea Contarini was in charged, one of the most powerful members of the family Contarini Branch San Paternian.
Initially, it was owned by Morosini, later the building was sold to the Contarini as dowry by the marriage of Caterina and Zuanne Contarini Morosini.  Towards the end of 1400 a special spiral staircase built by Pietro Contarini, son of Zuanne and Caterina, probably enriched the palace. It is true that, on the occasion of ""redecima"" in 1514, Pietro Contarini claimed that he was living in a residential house located in San Paternian.


In 1518, the year of his death, Pietro left the property to his daughter Contarina, where she lived with her husband and children. Another member of the family of successive generations will declare to live in the same building. 
The ownership of the property remained to the Contarini’s family throughout the eighteenth century, however, gaining the name of Minelli following the marriage between Elisabetta Contarini and Giovanni Minelli. The last heirs of the family Minelli sell their shares to Dominic Emery Toulon.
The palace was coming from a period in which was assigned to Arnaux Marseille called the Maltese who had opened a motel which still derives the name of the street (Calle delle Locande/ Calle of the motels) that leads to arrive to the small square of the Palace .
Since 1849 the property is linked to the ""Foundation Emery"" managed by the Fraternal of the poor of San Luca who assisted the needs of the parish. Since then the history of the building is linked with the story of assistance care in Venice: before the building came under the management of the Congregation of Charity and became the administrative center; then it is transferred to the Institute Manin changing jurisdiction from welfare to recovery.
This step is crucial because it will make that the Palazzo Contarini move to the IRE (Institution for recovery and Education) and will become in the manager of all institutions of refuge around the city.
From 1937, the building will become a branch of ECA (Municipal Assistance Entity) until 1975, the year when the duties of assistance will go to the district; while from 1939 the same will also host the offices of the IRE, that always in the '75 abandon it to leave space for restoration work.
The IRE, in addition to the social function, has a very important cultural function having inherited an artistic and architectural heritage of the ancient charities. During the Serenissima (Republic of Venice), in fact, the art was accompanied by social commitment, beautifying and enriching the different branches of the brotherhoods charitable. In this context we find the work of prominent artists and architects such Longhena for the Church of Beggars and the Church of Ospedaletto, Palladio for the Zitelle Church and Derelitti, Palma the younger for the Oratory of the Crociferi, Jacopo Guarana for frescoes in the Ospedaletto music room, Tiepolo for the Church of Mercy and the Church of Ospedaletto.

Whether the works be facsimiles of already created hand made books, works made specifically for book form, or simply a collection of works made by the artist, we hope these publications will bring awareness to the natural creativity possessed by individuals with disabilities and mental illnesses.  </p>

In 2012, John’s work was the focus of a major group exhibition curated by Matthew Higgs at Gallery Paule Anglim, San Francisco; he has also been exhibited at White Columns, New York, Rachel Uffner Gallery, New York, the San Francisco International Airport, and represented at contemporary art fairs like NADA Miami, the Independent, and Frieze New York.
