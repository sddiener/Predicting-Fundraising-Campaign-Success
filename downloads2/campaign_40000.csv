Environmental impact
“EcoRecho has been shown to reduce charcoal consumption by at least 50%”
Charcoal is made from trees. Charcoal making is therefore highly detrimental to Haiti’s landscape, farming, and overall economic status. On average 0.1 hectare of forest is required to produce 1 ton of charcoal.
Tree cover in Haiti has fallen from 63% in 1923 to 1.5% of total land today. Rapid deforestation has led to soil erosion and severe flooding, thus affecting agricultural yields and spurring more people to leave the rural areas and move into already overcrowded cities. 

Economic impact
“A successful adoption of the stove would translate into cash savings of US$150 per year for a family”
The cost of cooking fuel is quite high in Haiti; typically a poor family spends about 23% of its income on cooking fuel. Several factors explain the high cost of cooking fuel in Haiti.
● First, there are many middlemen and distributors that cause a spike in the price of cooking fuel. ● Finally, rapid urban growth has radically increased the demand for domestic fuels because charcoal is consumed mostly in cities. The recent earthquake in Haiti has devastated and laid bare its already fragile infrastructure. Unemployment is consequently rising and will further diminish the purchasing power of the population, creating a greater demand for Haiti's most accessible fuel.
SolutionTransforming the stoves market in Haiti by encouraging Haitian consumers to buy efficient charcoal stoves. If consumers replaced conventional charcoal stoves with efficient charcoal stoves in Haiti, deforestation will decrease, the health of users will improve and family and community spending on energy will decrease.

<p>Sounds of the Northern Wild is
 a half-hour documentary about the first expedition of The Arctic 
Soundscape Project. It shows Dr. Bernie Krause and his team recording 
nature sounds in a remote and unspoiled land. This movie will open

There they captured the song of the waters, the music of the hills, the 
calls and cries of wildlife. </p>
<p>With
 the money raised by this campaign, we will be able to finish the

<br/><p><b>Educational Use</b></p>
<p>Soundscapes
 are available in the archives of Bernie Krause and his colleagues and 
in nature sound libraries at various universities. As <span>
<i>Sounds of the Northern Wild</i></span> becomes accessible via broadcasts,
 webcasts, DVD screenings, film festivals and educational venues, the public will become aware of the wealth of nature sounds within these archives and of their importance.</p>
<p>As this film tells the story of a singular soundscape expedition in the 
Arctic, it models the use of audio equipment in a natural setting, demonstrating for students and other viewers the methods and ethics of nature sound recording that apply to the 
work of professional and citizen scientists everywhere. Besides 
inspiring the kind of listening that counteracts civilization's nature 
deficit disorder, recording geophonic and biophonic sounds offers 
science, art, and eco-outreach an important form of data collection and 
investigation. Soundscapes recorded in the same places at different 
times of year, as well as from year to year, mark changes in climatic 
patterns and species behavior over time. Such phenological data tracks, 
for example, the migration northward of bird species into biomes where 
they have never been heard before—changes due to human impact, climate 
disturbance, and other factors.</p>
<br/><p><b>The Filmmakers</b></p>
<p>Our award-winning filmmakers have extensive experience making documentaries about wide ranging topics and issues of our time. </p>
<p>Robert Hillmann, who led the video production team on the Arctic Soundscape Project, is the director of <i>Sounds of the Northern Wild</i>. He conceived and directed <i>Hidden Hawaii</i>,
 a 70mm IMAX film exploring how the most remote and isolated ecosystem 
on earth evolved uniquely until man and modern transportation introduced
 overwhelming challenges. His films have been shown and honored at many 
international film festivals including Cannes, New York, Telluride, 
Toronto, Melbourne, Rotterdam, Los Angeles, and Mannheim. He directed 
and produced <i>Fire on the Water</i>,
 winning Best Feature Documentary U.S./Park City Sundance, the Blue 
Ribbon First Prize in New York at the National Educational Film Festival
 as well as three national network EMMY nominations. He directed the Academy 
Award-nominated feature documentary <i>Waldo Salt: A Screenwriter's Journey</i>,
 broadcast on PBS American Masters. He has been awarded a Guggenheim 
Fellowship and been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences for twenty years.</p>
<p>Stephen Most, the writer/producer of <i>Sounds of the Northern Wild</i>, has worked as screenwriter or contributing writer on four Academy Award-nominated films, including <i>Berkeley in the Sixties</i> and <i>Promises</i>, and he is the screenwriter of five Emmy-winning documentaries, including <i>Wonders of Nature</i> and <i>Green Fire: Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time</i>. The documentary <i>River of Renewal</i>, which he wrote and produced, won the Best Documentary Award at the American Indian Film Festival. He is the author of <i>River of Renewal, Myth and History in the Klamath Basin</i>, published by the University of Washington Press.</p>
<p>Steve Michelson, the Executive Producer, has been the Executive Producer of many award-winning documentary films, including <i>Climb Against the Odds</i>, <i>Oil On Ice</i>, <i>Crude Impact</i>, <i>Burning the Future</i>, <i>River of Renewal</i>, and <i>Power Paths</i>.
 He and partner Craig Malina founded Specialty Studios, which 
distributes films about the environment, social justice, and 
sustainability, and they acquired The Video Project, an educational 
distributor.</p>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">“Bernie
 Krause is, above all, an artist. I have watched him recording the calls
 of chimpanzees, the singing of the insects and birds, and seen his deep
 love for the harmonies of nature… He helps us to hear and appreciate 
the often hidden musicians in a new way. But he warns that these songs, 
an intrinsic part of the natural world and essential to human well 
being, are vanishing, one by one, snuffed out by human actions.""</span> -Jane
 Goodall<br/><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Broadcast and Distribution Strategy</b></p>
<p><i>Sounds of the Northern Wild</i> is
 a perfect fit for the Natural Heroes series of the Sonoma County PBS 
station KRCB. That is especially the case in that Bernie Krause is a 
nature hero who lives there. Beyond broadcasting the documentary 
locally, KRCB can serve as a presenting station for the 300 PBS stations
 nationwide. The broadcast will be accompanied by a PR campaign seeking 
interviews and film from media outlets.</p>
<p>International
 broadcast markets will be approached through an international television distributor associated with Specialty Studios. There will be international 
interest, both because Bernie Krause is well-known worldwide as a leader
 in his field and because he has recorded nature sounds in many 
countries around the globe.</p>
<p>In
 addition to broadcasts, the documentary will reach the public through 
local screenings and DVD distribution. The film will have two 
distributors: Specialty Studios and The Video Project, a distributor of 
educational films. An enhanced DVD will be created for classroom use 
with extended interviews, a special study guide, and technical advice 
for nature sound recording. Additionally, the film 
will be available on digital platforms for classroom use and viewing.The
 home video version of the program will be released on DVD. Later the film will be shown on cable channels, 
followed by availability on cable VOD and Netflix, as well as online 
<span> for 
digital download </span>through Hulu and Snagfilms.</p>
<p><i>Sounds of the Northern Wild</i>
 will appear in film festivals around the world. These provide 
occasions for public appearances and interviews that increase awareness 
of the film and its purposes.</p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">“Bernie's
 research into the subtleties of animal and insect sounds is 
unparalleled, but it is his description of the radical changes that are 
taking place on this planet that really makes one stop and wonder... 
Listen carefully, for the sounds you hear may never be the same again.""</span>

times of year, as well as from year to year, mark changes in climatic 
patterns and species behavior over time. Such phenological data tracks, 
for example, the migration northward of bird species into biomes where 
they have never been heard before—changes due to human impact, climate 
disturbance, and other factors.
The Filmmakers
Our award-winning filmmakers have extensive experience making documentaries about wide ranging topics and issues of our time. 
Robert Hillmann, who led the video production team on the Arctic Soundscape Project, is the director of Sounds of the Northern Wild. He conceived and directed Hidden Hawaii,
 a 70mm IMAX film exploring how the most remote and isolated ecosystem 
on earth evolved uniquely until man and modern transportation introduced
 overwhelming challenges. His films have been shown and honored at many 
international film festivals including Cannes, New York, Telluride, 
Toronto, Melbourne, Rotterdam, Los Angeles, and Mannheim. He directed 
and produced Fire on the Water,
 winning Best Feature Documentary U.S./Park City Sundance, the Blue 
Ribbon First Prize in New York at the National Educational Film Festival
 as well as three national network EMMY nominations. He directed the Academy 
Award-nominated feature documentary Waldo Salt: A Screenwriter's Journey,
 broadcast on PBS American Masters. He has been awarded a Guggenheim 
Fellowship and been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences for twenty years.
Stephen Most, the writer/producer of Sounds of the Northern Wild, has worked as screenwriter or contributing writer on four Academy Award-nominated films, including Berkeley in the Sixties and Promises, and he is the screenwriter of five Emmy-winning documentaries, including Wonders of Nature and Green Fire: Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time. The documentary River of Renewal, which he wrote and produced, won the Best Documentary Award at the American Indian Film Festival. He is the author of River of Renewal, Myth and History in the Klamath Basin, published by the University of Washington Press.
Steve Michelson, the Executive Producer, has been the Executive Producer of many award-winning documentary films, including Climb Against the Odds, Oil On Ice, Crude Impact, Burning the Future, River of Renewal, and Power Paths.
 He and partner Craig Malina founded Specialty Studios, which 
distributes films about the environment, social justice, and 
sustainability, and they acquired The Video Project, an educational 
distributor.
“Bernie
 Krause is, above all, an artist. I have watched him recording the calls
 of chimpanzees, the singing of the insects and birds, and seen his deep
 love for the harmonies of nature… He helps us to hear and appreciate 
the often hidden musicians in a new way. But he warns that these songs, 
an intrinsic part of the natural world and essential to human well 
being, are vanishing, one by one, snuffed out by human actions."" -Jane
 Goodall
Broadcast and Distribution Strategy
Sounds of the Northern Wild is
 a perfect fit for the Natural Heroes series of the Sonoma County PBS 
station KRCB. That is especially the case in that Bernie Krause is a 
nature hero who lives there. Beyond broadcasting the documentary 
locally, KRCB can serve as a presenting station for the 300 PBS stations
 nationwide. The broadcast will be accompanied by a PR campaign seeking 
interviews and film from media outlets.
International
 broadcast markets will be approached through an international television distributor associated with Specialty Studios. There will be international 
interest, both because Bernie Krause is well-known worldwide as a leader
 in his field and because he has recorded nature sounds in many 
countries around the globe.
In
 addition to broadcasts, the documentary will reach the public through 
local screenings and DVD distribution. The film will have two 
distributors: Specialty Studios and The Video Project, a distributor of 
educational films. An enhanced DVD will be created for classroom use 
with extended interviews, a special study guide, and technical advice 
for nature sound recording. Additionally, the film 
will be available on digital platforms for classroom use and viewing.The
 home video version of the program will be released on DVD. Later the film will be shown on cable channels, 
followed by availability on cable VOD and Netflix, as well as online 
 for 
digital download through Hulu and Snagfilms.
Sounds of the Northern Wild
 will appear in film festivals around the world. These provide 
occasions for public appearances and interviews that increase awareness 
of the film and its purposes.
“Bernie's
 research into the subtleties of animal and insect sounds is 
unparalleled, but it is his description of the radical changes that are 
taking place on this planet that really makes one stop and wonder... 
Listen carefully, for the sounds you hear may never be the same again."" 
-Sir George Martin

Bees &amp; Butterflies</b><b><sup>TM</sup></b><b></b><b>Concept: </b></p>
<p></p><p>Woven
with the thread of urban sustainability, Bikes, Bees &amp; Butterflies engages
local artists and communities to vibrantly re-imagine the form and function of
discarded bicycles, upcycling them as an ingenious, high visual impact
framework to create urban habitats for pollinators while encouraging bicycling.
Bicycle baskets planted with native plants used as a food source by pollinators
will be attached to each bike to highlight the critical importance of
pollinators in our food production, economy and a healthy ecosystem. In
partnership with local and national organizations, educational programs will be
developed that connect the community to biodiversity focusing on pollination
ecology in the urban environment.</p>
<p><b>Goals:
We will… </b></p>
<p><b><i><u></u></i></b></p>
<p><b>1.<span>  </span></b>Obtain recycled and reclaimed bicycles
from local bike shops and organizations as a donation. Local artists will
design, re-imagine and transform bicycles into public art installations that
convey the importance of urban sustainability, biking and creating urban
habitats for pollinators.  Each bicycle
will be uniquely designed and promote the artist’s artistic style.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>2.<span>  </span></b>Use native plants that will create a
beautiful and ideal habitat for bees, butterflies and other pollinators. The
plants used on this project will naturally form sustainable pollinator habitats
that stimulate and rejuvenate the pollination process. Our efforts in this
project will help to counteract the challenges of pollinator habitat loss and
degradation in urban areas.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3.<span>  </span></b>Invite local organizations to partner
in developing educational programs that will inform the public about the vital
importance of pollinators in our economy, increase the visual impact of  bicycles and connect the community to the
purpose of the Bikes, Bees &amp; Butterflies project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4.<span>  </span></b>Create spaces in which people will be
comfortable, strengthen neighborhood connections, promote physical activity,
help people understand the importance of pollinator habitats and encourage an
educated, culturally vibrant environment.</p>

<p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>What is Urban Sustainability?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>A sustainable city or sustainable
landscapes <span>are cities designed with consideration
of environmental impact; sequestering carbon, clean the air and water,
increase energy efficiency, restore habitats, and create value through
significant economic, social and, environmental benefits. Citizens within
sustainable urban areas are dedicated to managing
resources in a way that guarantees welfare and promotes equity of current and
future generations. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>What are pollinators and why are they
important?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Pollinators
are vertebrate and invertebrate animals such as bees, butterflies, moths,
beetles, hummingbirds and bats. Pollination is the movement or transfer of
pollen/nectar between flowering plants that leads to plant reproduction.
Stephen Buchman and Gary Nabhan wrote, <i>“The
process of</i> <i>pollination keeps the
verdant world, known as the biosphere, running in endless cycles…The
intrafloral commerce by birds and bees is what makes the world go round on its
cycle.”</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Bees
and other pollinators provide a service to the ecosystem through pollination,
soil nutrition, and carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Why is the Bikes, Bees, Butterflies
Project Important?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>Pollinators

United States alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>b.<span>  </span></b>Pollinators (specifically bees) have
globally been declining by 25% over the past 15 years. Pollinator diversity and
populations have dwindled primarily due to threatening components such as
habitat loss and pesticides. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>c.<span>  </span></b>The global economic cost of bees
declining (lower crop yields combined with higher costs of production) has been
estimated as high as $5.7 billion annually.</p>
<p><b>d.<span>  </span></b>Annually bees pollinate about 150
crops in just the United States. Here are some of the crops that would
disappear without bees:</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Apples, almonds, blueberries,

<p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>How will public art help improve
public spaces?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Cities gain value through public art – cultural, social, and
economic value. Public art is a distinguishing part of our public history and
our evolving culture. It reflects and reveals our society, adds meaning to our
cities and uniqueness to our communities. Public art humanizes the built
environment and invigorates public spaces. It provides an intersection between
past, present and future, between disciplines, and between ideas. Public art is
freely accessible. Public art shows that residents have an interest in their
city—their blocks, neighborhoods, streets and fellow citizens. </p>
<p></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Upcycled Art is the process of converting salvaged materials
into new products of better quality or for better environmental value. It can
be anything from an art installation to a temporary “action” or advocacy
campaign to engage, educate and incite public involvement to repairing neighborhoods.
The goal is to get people to care about their city.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation (LPBF) is excited to announce the Bayou Saint John Wetland Creation Project, a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build ½ acre of native marsh in the city of New Orleans. LPBF is a non-profit group that has been working for southeast Louisiana’s people and environment since 1989 under the banner, “Save Our Lake, Save Our Coast.” <a href=""http://saveourlake.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://saveourlake.org</a></p>
<p>We came up with the plan to build wetlands as an add-on to a dredging project that was already scheduled for this spring. This opportunity came up quickly, and we have scrambled to draft plans, secure permits, and find partners before construction starts in mid-May 2013.</p>
<p>We are reaching out to everyone who loves New Orleans and cares about the vanishing Louisiana coast. Together we can rebuild a patch native habitat and bring some nature back to the Big Easy.</p>

<p>What we need:</p>
<p>We feel so strongly about this project that we committed to it without having all funding in place. We are raising money to cover construction costs, and then to fund ongoing maintenance and monitoring. If we raise more than we need for immediate costs, we will do more scientific research and add signage, wildlife viewing access and other improvements. Our ultimate goal is to make the Bayou St. John marsh a destination for education, recreation, bird watching and fishing.</p>
<p>This project will give lots of benefit for relatively low cost.

Many buildings suitable for use as bat roosts often require re-roofing as they age and traditional bituminous roofing felts are frequently being replaced with breathable roofing membranes (BRMs).

Funding was obtained through a PhD stipend. However, this funding ran out at the end of 2013 and the current economic climate makes finding research funding difficult for any subject......let alone a strange combination of ecology and engineering.</p><p>Yet this interdisciplinary research will make a real impact on Bat Conservation, not only in the UK, but throughout Europe. Many people working within the bat and roofing community agree, so I want to ask for your help to continue this research.</p><p>In doing this I will get everyone affected by this problem working together to create sensible and usable solutions.</p><p>Many people have asked why the manufacturers don't fund this work...I have written a short blog about it here: <a href=""http://www.batsandbrms.co.uk/updates/crowdfunding-why-is-it-needed-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.batsandbrms.co.uk/updates/crowdfundi...</a> </p><h2>What is the money for?</h2><p>The minimum target amount I have set is for £20,000. This is a large amount of money, yet in terms of research projects it is very small. This money will help with several things -</p><p>• <b>University fees</b>- In order to use the laboratory spaces and facilities needed for some of the technical aspects of this research I will need to use equipment based at Reading and Leeds Universities. This includes material testing machines, electron microscopes and environmental chambers.</p><p> • <b>Travel costs</b> - Going to sites in order to see where problems have occurred, visiting manufacturers, meeting with stakeholders, training events, workshops.....you get it, there's a lot of travel.</p><p> • <b>Equipment</b> - often to test materials you have to destroy them. This means I need to buy in the products in order to see how bat friendly they are. Also to develop remedial measures we need to try different things to see which works best....often in-situ.</p><p> • <b>Website Upgrade - </b>at present I pay for the website myself and it has done quite well for 4 years. But now I want to include more information, more images, videos and a searchable product database. This will require a much fancier website and the money raised will help achieve that.</p><p>The aim is that this money will help this project continue for another 2 years. The money raised will be primarily used to help develop remedial measures for roosts where these problems have already occurred. It will also be used to help investigate alternative products to help prevent this occurring in the future.</p><p>The other area the money will provide support is the production of educational tools. This will include an upgraded website with more information, image galleries for use and information. It will also aid the production of academic papers to increase the integrity of the scientific research, a booklet on bats in roofs for both ecologists and roofers and collaborative projects between industry and conservation. These projects may lead to further projects looking at producing bat friendly roofing membranes.</p><p>In this time I aim to achieve most of the objectives stated in the video. The amount to be raised is really the minimum needed, so any money raised over that amount will only further the potential of this research and my ability to complete it.</p><p>To give you a very brief idea of costs -</p><p>• a single day in a materials testing lab will cost around £400</p><p>• an hour using an Electron Microscope costs £30</p><p>• A roll of BRM costs between £50 - £200</p><p>• A custom-made panel to test a remedial measure in-situ ~ £500 (including fitting, travel and materials)</p><p>• To upgrade the website and run it for two years will cost approximately £600</p><h2>Testimonials - (Why others think it's impor<span style=""background-color: initial;"">tant!)</span>

As humanitarian clowns, we strive to make a change in a holistic manner, dealing with all aspects of the problems. We found out that our workshops can help the children minds, but can´t provide them with clear drinking water nor food... Without solving the hunger problem, even the funniest clown will find it hard to make a child smile. Therefore we researched and found the aqua phonic system as the best solution.</p>
<p>Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. In Aquaponics, the fish and plants are grown together in one integrated, soilless system. The fish waste provides a food source for the plants and the plants provide a natural filter for the water the fish live in. Simple, sustainable, safe, fresh, organic fish and vegetables are produced but mainly pure clean drinking water.</p>
<p>The system we aim to bring to Belen, will be done with the supervision of Shlomi zarihan, an expert marine biologist with years of experience in aquaculture and Aquaponics. Shlomi’s mission is to provide and teach methods for a sustainable way of life and preservation of the marine environment.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong><strong> statement <br/></strong></p>
<p>We believe that empowering the local communities, situated in one of the most important ecosystem in the world, the Amazon rainforest, will create a healthier more sustainable future for the earth.</p>
<p>We have identified some of Belen’s acute problems and as a holistic solution we want to offer the community help through educational workshops, clowning art and ecology. We have partnered with an expert marine biologist specializing sustainable water filtration and food cultivation in aquatic systems and we want to bring his experience in order to construct the aqua phonic system described above.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that this system and further education and cooperation with La Restinga, will bring a true and fundamental change to the local populations´ quality of living, mainly the children.</p>
<p>We realized that in Belen we can achieve the best results and help over 10,000 families in the region through educational workshops and the physical construction of the first Aquaponics system in the region.</p>

Belen is a forgotten district in Iquitos, the largest city of the Peruvian amazons. The district of Belen presents severe sanitary issues, social violence, and as a result of this reality, many health problems. There is no drinking water available nor daily food supply. Kismaya theatre will go to Belen offering a workshop for kids and building an aqua phonic system, providing sustainable drinking water and food.

Background
Kismaya is theatre group founded in 2008, directed by Talya Weinberg, humanitarian clown, focusing in education through workshops, plays and ecology projects.
The Gezuntheid institute from the US, and Bola Roja association based in Lima, Peru, have been working for the last 9 years, bringing clowns, artists and health professionals to work for and with the community, for a healthier Belen. The main work is done through the organization of the annual Belen Festival that combines street performances and art workshops with public health guides, using art as a bridge to health. 
This year, with your help, Kismaya will join the Belen Festival and work with La Restinga, a local organization, established in 2004, working to empower the local community through education in ecology and art. As humanitarian clowns, we strive to make a change in a holistic manner, dealing with all aspects of the problems. We found out that our workshops can help the children minds, but can´t provide them with clear drinking water nor food... Without solving the hunger problem, even the funniest clown will find it hard to make a child smile. Therefore we researched and found the aqua phonic system as the best solution.

The system we aim to bring to Belen, will be done with the supervision of Shlomi zarihan, an expert marine biologist with years of experience in aquaculture and Aquaponics. Shlomi’s mission is to provide and teach methods for a sustainable way of life and preservation of the marine environment.

Mission statement 
We believe that empowering the local communities, situated in one of the most important ecosystem in the world, the Amazon rainforest, will create a healthier more sustainable future for the earth.
We have identified some of Belen’s acute problems and as a holistic solution we want to offer the community help through educational workshops, clowning art and ecology. We have partnered with an expert marine biologist specializing sustainable water filtration and food cultivation in aquatic systems and we want to bring his experience in order to construct the aqua phonic system described above.
We strongly believe that this system and further education and cooperation with La Restinga, will bring a true and fundamental change to the local populations´ quality of living, mainly the children.
We realized that in Belen we can achieve the best results and help over 10,000 families in the region through educational workshops and the physical construction of the first Aquaponics system in the region.

Our goals
Kismaya is asking for your help in raising $6,250 in order to pay for the following: - transport fees, 2 person - $2,100 - Living expenses, 2 person, 3 weeks - $900 - Educational materials & documentation - $150 - Educational plays and Workshops performed by Kismaya - Volunteered - Construction materials for Aqua phonic system - $1,750- construction labor - Volunteered - Expert Biologist labor - $700- Presents for donators - $400- Indiegogo & payment processing services fees - $500
For every additional $6,000 we can establish another aquaphonic system and deliver the proper educational framework in order to make it viable. Siloe, Cali, Colombia being the next destination.
This Project is designated to help the children of Belen - the bigger portion of the poor population of Belen. This is a pilot project, empowering local community leaders, that can be implemented in numerous other communities in need, thus building strong sustainable communities, eliminating poverty, violence, children abuse and creating an ecologically sounds environment in the rain forest and other endangered ecosystems.
With your contribution you are enabling drinking water access, better education and happiness to numerous deprived children.
For your help we will commemorate your effort with different perks according to the magnitude of your donation. For a large donation of $500 or more, a named plank caring your name will be installed on the system.

Other Ways You Can Help
We realize that not all of us can contribute funds. That doesn’t mean you can’t help! Spread the word. Email your friends. Share us on Facebook. Help us make this world a better place, especially for the children.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 38px;"">Your Perks</span><br/></p>
<h4>$2: Two High Fives from TMC!</h4>
<p>Give $2 and you'll be in on future campaign updates, and you'll know that you are, indeed, awesome. If we meet you in person, we will definitely consider high-fiving you, twice.</p>
<h4>$20: Gift Code</h4>
<p>Give $20 and we will send you a coupon code that you can redeem on our online shop - foodforesters.org . We will send you the code in time for your holiday season shopping too...</p>
<h4>$50: Gift Certificate</h4>
<p>Give $50 and you get a real, snail-mailed TMC gift certificate (delivery late November 2013), redeemable online, or in-person at TMC if attend a workshop or eat at our boutique restaurant. If you let us know, we will include a message so you can make this into a practical gift (that gives twice) for someone special.</p>
<h4>$100: Adopt a Tree</h4>
<p><b>In a few short years, visitors to The Molina Center will be able to walk in one of the most extensive food forests in the USA.</b> As part of creating our food forest, we will be planting at least 1000 trees - big and small - over the next few years. We want to make a visit to our forest a fun, educational and interactive experience. Your adopted tree will have a small NFC enabled tag on which visitors can tap their smartphone to view details about the tree - it's species, ecological niche and human use, <i>plus view your own customizable message</i> (which could be text, a photo, a video - anything you can link to on the internet!). Your tree's visitors can even leave you a message or a photo of your tree... We will setup your NFC tag and virtual content by Summer 2014, but tags will be assigned to trees as they are planted on a first-come-first-served basis. They sooner you claim your perk, the sooner your tree will be in the ground! Our website will also have an interactive map of the food forest available for people to virtually visit your tree.</p>
<h4>$500: Sponsor a Quilt Patch</h4>
<p>In the foyer to the Administration Center, there will be a large (5x7 feet) handmade quilt. Your patch (approx 5x8 inches) will have your name and/or short message embroidered on it and will be seen by every visitor to TMC forever... Only 100 patches are available, the quilt will be made in early 2014.</p>
<h4>$1,000: Adopt a Solar Panel</h4>
<p>As soon as possible, we want TMC to be producing all of it's own electricity from the abundant solar energy here in Colorado. To do that, we need to build an array of 200 solar panels. We will have a real-time display of energy generation in our foyer, where individual panels will be shown. Your name will be shown on your panel, and you will also be able to share your panel's CO2 offsetting prowess with your friends via the Internet. Our website will also contain an interactive map of our installation, which can include your name and/or a link of your choosing. Like the trees, panels will be assigned to adopters on a first-come-first-served basis. Our arrays will be built in four stages, we will build the stages that are fully funded by this campaign in early 2014, otherwise we will seek further funds to complete the array as soon as possible and keep you informed throughout the process.</p>
<h4>$5,000: Edibly Landscape Your Place</h4>
<p>Once we have our Food Foresters team skilled up, they will be available to create edible landscapes <i>anywhere</i>. This major perk will get you at least $5000 off the price of bringing the team to your home or business and implementing a permaculture design to secure your local and organic food supply. Due to time and resource restraints - and that we want to ensure that we can deliver in 2014, only 4 of these are available.</p>
<h4>$10,000: Colorado Adventure for Two</h4>
<p>Let's face it - The Molina Center is located in an awesome part of the world. <b>Who doesn't want to come to Colorado and get the VIP treatment for 5 days?</b> Come and stay with us and we will arrange trips to locations of your choice from Aspen, Telluride, Powderhorn Resort, hiking or cross-country skiing on the Grand Mesa, Arches National Park, Colorado National Monument and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, plus open access to any workshops and events that are on while you are here.  <b>We can only do this twice... do you prefer Summer or Winter?</b></p>
<h2>Spread the Word and Be Rewarded</h2>
<p>Just because you're not up to giving some money and collecting a perk, doesn't mean you can't help out and make a difference. <b>Even better - we have partnered with some smart innovative companies to offer you awesome referral prizes!</b></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b>AquaFarm</b> is made by <i>Back To The Roots</i> in Oakland CA and retails for <b>$59.99</b>, while the <b>Windowfarm</b> is from <i>Windowfarms</i> and you will get the ""One-Column Starter Bundle"" which retails for <b>$199.00</b>. Both of these products grew out of successful crowdfunding campaigns and we plan to use them extensively in our programs. You should receive your prize in time for Christmas 2013.</p>
<p>The <b>Genesis Dosing Controller</b> is created by <i>Sustainable Microfarms</i> and their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign is launching September 2013.

<p>If you are <i>not</i> from the USA and win a referral prize, keep in mind that key parts of these products won't be able to be shipped to you (growing media, seeds, etc.) - we will let you know if you are affected and how to source the missing organic components locally.</p>

We would change the world!
The Molina Center is building a place which equalizes opportunity for young people, breaking at-risk youth out of chronic poverty, homelessness and unemployment and tuning them into the reality that solving global challenges locally has a neat side-effect: employment, education and a brighter future for all.
We will engage at-risk youth with paid internships in sustainability - a long-term transitional residential program running every aspect of our social enterprise businesses. Working as a team in an entrepreneurial environment where everyone is encouraged and supported to consider their reach and capacity to make a lasting difference. Within a real eco-village community that gives full support for our interns to run every aspect of our business and community life.
Yes, real paid internships for at-risk youth.
With all the wholistic structure and support needed to ensure lasting success.
If you are an intern coming to live and work at The Molina Center:


we will meet you where you are - now, and move with you to the future you want

we will create mentoring partnerships with key experts in the local community

Give $20 and we will send you a coupon code that you can redeem on our online shop - foodforesters.org . We will send you the code in time for your holiday season shopping too...
$50: Gift Certificate
Give $50 and you get a real, snail-mailed TMC gift certificate (delivery late November 2013), redeemable online, or in-person at TMC if attend a workshop or eat at our boutique restaurant. If you let us know, we will include a message so you can make this into a practical gift (that gives twice) for someone special.
$100: Adopt a Tree
In a few short years, visitors to The Molina Center will be able to walk in one of the most extensive food forests in the USA. As part of creating our food forest, we will be planting at least 1000 trees - big and small - over the next few years. We want to make a visit to our forest a fun, educational and interactive experience. Your adopted tree will have a small NFC enabled tag on which visitors can tap their smartphone to view details about the tree - it's species, ecological niche and human use, plus view your own customizable message (which could be text, a photo, a video - anything you can link to on the internet!). Your tree's visitors can even leave you a message or a photo of your tree... We will setup your NFC tag and virtual content by Summer 2014, but tags will be assigned to trees as they are planted on a first-come-first-served basis. They sooner you claim your perk, the sooner your tree will be in the ground! Our website will also have an interactive map of the food forest available for people to virtually visit your tree.
$500: Sponsor a Quilt Patch
In the foyer to the Administration Center, there will be a large (5x7 feet) handmade quilt. Your patch (approx 5x8 inches) will have your name and/or short message embroidered on it and will be seen by every visitor to TMC forever... Only 100 patches are available, the quilt will be made in early 2014.
$1,000: Adopt a Solar Panel
As soon as possible, we want TMC to be producing all of it's own electricity from the abundant solar energy here in Colorado. To do that, we need to build an array of 200 solar panels. We will have a real-time display of energy generation in our foyer, where individual panels will be shown. Your name will be shown on your panel, and you will also be able to share your panel's CO2 offsetting prowess with your friends via the Internet. Our website will also contain an interactive map of our installation, which can include your name and/or a link of your choosing. Like the trees, panels will be assigned to adopters on a first-come-first-served basis. Our arrays will be built in four stages, we will build the stages that are fully funded by this campaign in early 2014, otherwise we will seek further funds to complete the array as soon as possible and keep you informed throughout the process.
$5,000: Edibly Landscape Your Place
Once we have our Food Foresters team skilled up, they will be available to create edible landscapes anywhere. This major perk will get you at least $5000 off the price of bringing the team to your home or business and implementing a permaculture design to secure your local and organic food supply. Due to time and resource restraints - and that we want to ensure that we can deliver in 2014, only 4 of these are available.
$10,000: Colorado Adventure for Two
Let's face it - The Molina Center is located in an awesome part of the world. Who doesn't want to come to Colorado and get the VIP treatment for 5 days? Come and stay with us and we will arrange trips to locations of your choice from Aspen, Telluride, Powderhorn Resort, hiking or cross-country skiing on the Grand Mesa, Arches National Park, Colorado National Monument and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, plus open access to any workshops and events that are on while you are here.  We can only do this twice... do you prefer Summer or Winter?
Spread the Word and Be Rewarded
Just because you're not up to giving some money and collecting a perk, doesn't mean you can't help out and make a difference. Even better - we have partnered with some smart innovative companies to offer you awesome referral prizes!



AquaFarm is made by Back To The Roots in Oakland CA and retails for $59.99, while the Windowfarm is from Windowfarms and you will get the ""One-Column Starter Bundle"" which retails for $199.00. Both of these products grew out of successful crowdfunding campaigns and we plan to use them extensively in our programs. You should receive your prize in time for Christmas 2013.
The Genesis Dosing Controller is created by Sustainable Microfarms and their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign is launching September 2013. It will retail for over $700 and will ship to you in early 2014. Again, this is a product which we plan to use in our programs into the future.
If you are not from the USA and win a referral prize, keep in mind that key parts of these products won't be able to be shipped to you (growing media, seeds, etc.) - we will let you know if you are affected and how to source the missing organic components locally.

Central Bureau of Statistics, the average waste per person is 600 grams

or burnt in the urban areas, both of which result in health and 
environmental problems.  However, there is limited understanding of

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p><span>When voices are raised in song – they have power beyond the spoken word. Historically, we have seen how songs raise consciousness, cultivate change and inspire action (towards fighting aids, hunger -  think ""</span><em>We are the World""</em><span>). </span><strong>Cool the World transcends geography, language and socio-economic boundaries. </strong><span>It will be sung by the voices of those who stand to lose the most if we don't </span><em>cool</em><span> this planet: children.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We'll create compelling content: footage of kids singing CTW in their native languages, tagged with vignettes of how climate change has effected their areas. (5 - 7  minute investigative reports with KIDS as the focus.)</li>
<li>We will work with NGO's, educators, businesses to leverage this content in local markets to raise awareness</li>
<li>in tandem with this, we'll pursue exploration of using Cool the World as tag for 90 second spots that speak to the GOOD that is going on with companies. Most sustainability reports and plans are not read by the average customer - they consume without knowing. THis is a missed opportunity.</li>
</ul><p>We're betting that business leaders will pay attention to this - beyond doomsday statistics.</p>
<h3><strong>What's at Stake?</strong></h3>
<p>Most of us feel distant from the impacts of global warming. Our children will not have that luxury. Many insects, plants, foods, and animals will not endure the climate change over the next 50 years. Extinction effects our entire ecosystem in devastating ways. The  comfort, enjoyment and vitality of our children's lives are at stake. They understand. They are concerned. Now is the time to send the urgent message to those who have the power to cool the world - in big and small ways. Thank you for being a part this solution. Raising awareness is a huge challenge. This song sung by thousands of voices will cool the world. Business owners will hear the call, as will world leaders. And we’ll reach a tipping point of change. This is our vision.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>How will <strong>Cool the World</strong> impact people and the issues of global warming?</p>
<ul>
<li>It will engage young people all over the world to raise their voices in one song, with one message: cool the world.</li>
<li>It will be a marketing tool for any organization on the front lines of advocacy</li>
<li>It will give these young voices a powerful platform from which to beautifully express their united front against the continuation of irresponsible behaviors that harm the environme'nt</li>
<li>It will foster cross-cultural and intergenerational conversations about global warming</li>
<li>It will engage the media to consider the effects of global warming in the context of how they impact young lives all over the planet</li>
<li>It will make the global warming issue personal and emotional – and that has to happen in order to motivate individuals to become stakeholders and game changers by shifting their own behaviors.</li>
</ul><p>Artists for Literacy (.org) was founded in 2000 to tackle illiteracy in this country. We sold over 30,000 CD's to raise awareness of and money for free literacy programs. We mobilized over 1000 songwriters into action through contests, and garnered the support of Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Tom Waits, Roseanne Cash, and Suzanne Vega. We had coverage by the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone, Billboard, and NPR.</p>
<p><strong>We know how to produce campaigns that make an impact</strong>. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>When we raise this $36,000, it will ‘kick-start’ the development of <strong>A Thousand Voices to Cool the World</strong>. The team assembled will include Artists for Literacy, joined by a business development team, a technical team, and a production coordinator. It will also immediately secure the services of a PR/Marketing team to plan and execute on a Phase 1 promotion campaign that will ensure our efforts are not kept secret at any time in the production process. It will enable us to start coordinating the participation of choirs from around the country and world.</p>
<p>If you have a company that would do well by supporting this campaign – please give more generously than you would as an individual - and contact me directly. By leveraging your existing infrastructure, we won’t need to re-invent the wheel. We'll do right by this project together.</p>
<p><strong>Cool the World is a project of Artists for Literacy. Your investment will be tax-deductable. Please give NOW while you are here on this page. Life has a way of getting in the way!</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE share our campaign page with your own social network (along with a personal note from you). The tools are above - right under the video. When you do, your investment in the project will grow exponentially. That's how crowd funding works. Your friends will care about this project, too, and want to make an investment. <span>But they have to know about it first</span><span>.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Production Credits</strong></h3>
<p>The first Cool the World Choir you see singing here is made up of 20 kids who live in Los Angeles. They and their families recently volunteered their time to learn and record this song. <a href=""http://www.serenacreative.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Serena Creative, Inc</a>. donated the production of the video. <a href=""http://www.emotomusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emoto Music, Inc</a>. donated their recording facility, their musicians, and their production skills. I donated my time to wrtie the song, organize, rehearse and direct the choir and now plan to take this project’s potential further. Indeed, it took a magnificent, creative village to produce the first Cool the World Choir. I am lucky to live in this village, and from this fertile place, I’d like to continue to cool the world with a thousand additional young voices from around the country and planet.</p>
<p>By the way, all the renditions of ‘Cool the World’ will be sung in the same key (C), to the same beats per minute (98). The mash-up possibilities are endless and full of electrifying potential.</p>

Summary
When voices are raised in song – they have power beyond the spoken word. Historically, we have seen how songs raise consciousness, cultivate change and inspire action (towards fighting aids, hunger -  think ""We are the World""). Cool the World transcends geography, language and socio-economic boundaries. It will be sung by the voices of those who stand to lose the most if we don't cool this planet: children.

We'll create compelling content: footage of kids singing CTW in their native languages, tagged with vignettes of how climate change has effected their areas. (5 - 7  minute investigative reports with KIDS as the focus.)
We will work with NGO's, educators, businesses to leverage this content in local markets to raise awareness
in tandem with this, we'll pursue exploration of using Cool the World as tag for 90 second spots that speak to the GOOD that is going on with companies. Most sustainability reports and plans are not read by the average customer - they consume without knowing. THis is a missed opportunity.
We're betting that business leaders will pay attention to this - beyond doomsday statistics.
What's at Stake?
Most of us feel distant from the impacts of global warming. Our children will not have that luxury. Many insects, plants, foods, and animals will not endure the climate change over the next 50 years. Extinction effects our entire ecosystem in devastating ways. The  comfort, enjoyment and vitality of our children's lives are at stake. They understand. They are concerned. Now is the time to send the urgent message to those who have the power to cool the world - in big and small ways. Thank you for being a part this solution. Raising awareness is a huge challenge. This song sung by thousands of voices will cool the world. Business owners will hear the call, as will world leaders. And we’ll reach a tipping point of change. This is our vision.
The Impact
How will Cool the World impact people and the issues of global warming?

It will engage young people all over the world to raise their voices in one song, with one message: cool the world.
It will be a marketing tool for any organization on the front lines of advocacy
It will give these young voices a powerful platform from which to beautifully express their united front against the continuation of irresponsible behaviors that harm the environme'nt
It will foster cross-cultural and intergenerational conversations about global warming
It will engage the media to consider the effects of global warming in the context of how they impact young lives all over the planet
It will make the global warming issue personal and emotional – and that has to happen in order to motivate individuals to become stakeholders and game changers by shifting their own behaviors.
Artists for Literacy (.org) was founded in 2000 to tackle illiteracy in this country. We sold over 30,000 CD's to raise awareness of and money for free literacy programs. We mobilized over 1000 songwriters into action through contests, and garnered the support of Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Tom Waits, Roseanne Cash, and Suzanne Vega. We had coverage by the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone, Billboard, and NPR.
We know how to produce campaigns that make an impact. 
What We Need & What You Get
When we raise this $36,000, it will ‘kick-start’ the development of A Thousand Voices to Cool the World. The team assembled will include Artists for Literacy, joined by a business development team, a technical team, and a production coordinator. It will also immediately secure the services of a PR/Marketing team to plan and execute on a Phase 1 promotion campaign that will ensure our efforts are not kept secret at any time in the production process. It will enable us to start coordinating the participation of choirs from around the country and world.
If you have a company that would do well by supporting this campaign – please give more generously than you would as an individual - and contact me directly. By leveraging your existing infrastructure, we won’t need to re-invent the wheel. We'll do right by this project together.
Cool the World is a project of Artists for Literacy. Your investment will be tax-deductable. Please give NOW while you are here on this page. Life has a way of getting in the way!
PLEASE share our campaign page with your own social network (along with a personal note from you). The tools are above - right under the video. When you do, your investment in the project will grow exponentially. That's how crowd funding works. Your friends will care about this project, too, and want to make an investment. But they have to know about it first.

Together, we’ll cool the world with a thousand voices...and beyond.

Production Credits
The first Cool the World Choir you see singing here is made up of 20 kids who live in Los Angeles. They and their families recently volunteered their time to learn and record this song. Serena Creative, Inc. donated the production of the video. Emoto Music, Inc. donated their recording facility, their musicians, and their production skills. I donated my time to wrtie the song, organize, rehearse and direct the choir and now plan to take this project’s potential further. Indeed, it took a magnificent, creative village to produce the first Cool the World Choir. I am lucky to live in this village, and from this fertile place, I’d like to continue to cool the world with a thousand additional young voices from around the country and planet.
By the way, all the renditions of ‘Cool the World’ will be sung in the same key (C), to the same beats per minute (98). The mash-up possibilities are endless and full of electrifying potential.
You can download a audio only version of the song here.

How Does it Work?</h3>
<p>A Water Wheel is the sacred geometry design you see above. It is 
based on a Native American medicine wheel. Its purpose is to energize, 
celebrate, and honor water. It is also a place to deepen our 
relationship with the spirit of water.</p>
<p>A Water Wheel can be a personal altar in your home (Water Wheel Kit),
 or the design can be laid on the earth like a medicine wheel using corn
 meal, flowers, or stones. Seven clear quartz crystals activate six 
points around the circle and the center and transmit healing energy to 
and from the wheel.</p>
<p>Water Wheels are activated by our thoughts, intentions, and clear 
quartz crystals to create an energy field, or vortex of consciousness, 
for energizing water. Water Wheels get our thoughts of love, gratitude, 
and appreciation, which have been scientifically proven to transform the
 very structure of water, flowing to water. The more love and energy the
 Water Wheel receives from us, the more energy goes out to help our 
source waters… from which all living things are fed.</p>

 population of approximately 938 inhabitants. The residents have a sanitation problem caused by the
 inadequate latrines traditionally used. Before the composting toilets  project, 95% of its latrines were in poor condition (127 
families have problems with traditional latrines).  These latrines flood with
 water during the winter and fail in the summer due to a weakened 
internal structure. Because of this, inhabitants experience a high 
rate of illnesses due to exposure to fecal matter and water 
contamination.The environment is polluted and inhabitants are 
exposed to physical harm due to the high probability of latrine 
collapse.</p><p></p><p><b>Project Goals</b></p><p>The main goals of this project are:  </p><ul>
<li>Build on the 
successful pilot program and deploy more composting toilets with 
families, in sets of ten, until all the families in need are 
successfully maintaining their composting toilets and using the organic 
compost for their crops.  </li>
<li>Change the negative image of organic compost obtained from human excrement that exists in the culture. </li>
<li>Implement
 environmental sanitation methods to protect the community’s water 
sources, which are the Fonseca River’s springs (river that supplies the 
potable water to the Boaco Region). </li>
<li>Successfully execute 
the project and administer the funds acquired for the composting 
toilets. Issue a project report for each phase.</li>
</ul><br/><p></p><p><b>Background</b><b> </b></p><p>In 2010 EWB-SFP ATDT contacted Outreach International for a possible project location after a project in another country did not materialize. <a href=""http://outreach-international.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Outreach International (OI)</a> partnered with Alcance Nicaragua (AN) and Alvarez Co-op (Cooperativa de Autogestión Hermanos en Acción RL)  for the initial location for the composting latrines. Alcance Nicaragua is one of the in-country field programs of Outreach International. <br/></p><p></p><p><b>Participants</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/744335/files/20140725173821-NIC_Slidepartners_crpd.jpg?1406335101"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>The EWB Response</b><br/></p><p>In spring 2010 ATDT
 visited the community and discussed various composting toilet designs 
during a community workshop coordinated through Alvarez Co-op and AN with the support of OI. Based on the experience of a local leader, a
 two-vault above-ground system was selected. This design met the goal 
of the project and resolved the
 issue of latrines flooding during the winter and collapsing in the 
summer. <br/></p><p>In Fall 2010, ATDT team members 
presented the design and materials list.  AN managed the project though the Alvarez Co-op. Alvarez Co-op managed the materials purchase and transportation, 
identified 15 homes (based on survey data) and prioritized ten 
beneficiaries based on criteria of: latrine condition, number of people,
 type of soil, financial situation, and commitment to project.</p><p>In January 2011, ten composting latrines were built, benefiting 47 people from 10 families. AN organized working groups which consisted of the project beneficiaries and their families. Graceland University Students who were spending their winter term in 
2011 with Alcance Nicaragua contributed significant labor for the excavation and toilet foundation and construction of the composting toilets.</p><p>Workshops were conducted on the use and maintenance of the composting latrines. Participants included the ten beneficiaries, Alvarez Co-op members, 
youths involved with the construction, members of the Llanito Co-op,  
EWB-SFP ATDT members, and a team from AN.</p><h3></h3><p><b>2013-2014 Assessment results </b><br/>The pilot project has been monitored by Alvarez Co-op and AN. After three years of use, the 
composting toilets are working great. User acceptance has been high. On average, families harvest organic fertilizer with a value 
of ~$77 per cycle. More families in  the community want to replace their traditional latrines with composting toilets. The composting toilet has been redesigned, reducing the cost per toilet by half to 
~$300 – less than the cost of a conventional latrine, which needs to be 
replaced annually. </p><p>See prototype redesigned toilet below:<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/679846/files/20140627155416-letrina_abonera_new_inovacion__2_.JPG?1403909656"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3></h3><p>See the video below for Daniel, a satisfied user's experience.<br/></p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/zJ4tUlOj02M"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<br/><b>Moving Forward </b><br/>ATDT is fundraising 
for an August 2014 trip to deploy ten more of the redesigned composting 
toilets and another ten toilets on the next trip. We plan future campaigns and trips for all the families that 
need them. We are also looking at additional communities with sanitation needs. The more funds we raise, the more families we can help.<br/><p></p><p></p> <p> </p><h3>We need your financial support<br/>
</h3> <ul>
<li>For every $3000 we raise, we'll deploy ten more composting toilets. In this campaign, if we make our goal we could do two more sets.<br/>
</li>
<li>Alcance Nicaragua is identifying participants in Los Alvarez and El Llanito.</li>
<li>Participants will contribute 40-50% of the total cost of the latrine over a period of 18-24 months</li>
<li>The goal is to build four composting toilets concurrently over four days (12 days to build 10)</li>
<li>Construction is tentatively scheduled from mid-August to September, 2014<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds we do raise will be used to deliver as many composting toilets as we can. We are seeking other funding sources as well. <br/></p><p>If we exceed our funding goals, we will continue to work with our NGO partner on future trips to deliver toilets to all the families that need them including other communities.</p><p></p><h3>Your contribution will make a difference!<br/>
</h3> Worldwide lack of sanitation is a major problem. Over 2.6 
billion people don’t have access to toilets. The pilot project was a success and the community wants 
and needs more.

EWB-San Francisco Professionals Appropriate Technology Design Team (EWB-SFP ATDT) needs your help to fund the next sets of composting toilets with the community of Los Alvarez in Santa Lucia, Boaco, Nicaragua. For every $3000 we raise, we'll deploy ten redesigned composting latrines.Engineers Without Borders-USA (EWB-USA) supports community-driven 
development programs worldwide through the design and implementation of 
sustainable engineering projects while fostering responsible leadership.EWB-SFP 
ATDT is a group of MEs, EEs and other product development professionals
 who provide engineering design and research assistance for projects in 
developing communities throughout the world.
(Map above courtesy of Google)The NeedThe community of Los Alvarez consists of 134 families and has a
 population of approximately 938 inhabitants. The residents have a sanitation problem caused by the
 inadequate latrines traditionally used. Before the composting toilets  project, 95% of its latrines were in poor condition (127 
families have problems with traditional latrines).  These latrines flood with
 water during the winter and fail in the summer due to a weakened 
internal structure. Because of this, inhabitants experience a high 
rate of illnesses due to exposure to fecal matter and water 
contamination.The environment is polluted and inhabitants are 
exposed to physical harm due to the high probability of latrine 
collapse.Project GoalsThe main goals of this project are:  
Build on the 
successful pilot program and deploy more composting toilets with 
families, in sets of ten, until all the families in need are 
successfully maintaining their composting toilets and using the organic 
compost for their crops.  
Change the negative image of organic compost obtained from human excrement that exists in the culture. 
Implement
 environmental sanitation methods to protect the community’s water 
sources, which are the Fonseca River’s springs (river that supplies the 
potable water to the Boaco Region). 
Successfully execute 
the project and administer the funds acquired for the composting 
toilets. Issue a project report for each phase.
Background In 2010 EWB-SFP ATDT contacted Outreach International for a possible project location after a project in another country did not materialize. Outreach International (OI) partnered with Alcance Nicaragua (AN) and Alvarez Co-op (Cooperativa de Autogestión Hermanos en Acción RL)  for the initial location for the composting latrines. Alcance Nicaragua is one of the in-country field programs of Outreach International. ParticipantsThe EWB ResponseIn spring 2010 ATDT
 visited the community and discussed various composting toilet designs 
during a community workshop coordinated through Alvarez Co-op and AN with the support of OI. Based on the experience of a local leader, a
 two-vault above-ground system was selected. This design met the goal 
of the project and resolved the
 issue of latrines flooding during the winter and collapsing in the 
summer. In Fall 2010, ATDT team members 
presented the design and materials list.  AN managed the project though the Alvarez Co-op. Alvarez Co-op managed the materials purchase and transportation, 
identified 15 homes (based on survey data) and prioritized ten 
beneficiaries based on criteria of: latrine condition, number of people,
 type of soil, financial situation, and commitment to project.In January 2011, ten composting latrines were built, benefiting 47 people from 10 families. AN organized working groups which consisted of the project beneficiaries and their families. Graceland University Students who were spending their winter term in 
2011 with Alcance Nicaragua contributed significant labor for the excavation and toilet foundation and construction of the composting toilets.Workshops were conducted on the use and maintenance of the composting latrines. Participants included the ten beneficiaries, Alvarez Co-op members, 
youths involved with the construction, members of the Llanito Co-op,  
EWB-SFP ATDT members, and a team from AN.2013-2014 Assessment results The pilot project has been monitored by Alvarez Co-op and AN. After three years of use, the 
composting toilets are working great. User acceptance has been high. On average, families harvest organic fertilizer with a value 
of ~$77 per cycle. More families in  the community want to replace their traditional latrines with composting toilets. The composting toilet has been redesigned, reducing the cost per toilet by half to 
~$300 – less than the cost of a conventional latrine, which needs to be 
replaced annually. See prototype redesigned toilet below:See the video below for Daniel, a satisfied user's experience.
Moving Forward ATDT is fundraising 
for an August 2014 trip to deploy ten more of the redesigned composting 
toilets and another ten toilets on the next trip. We plan future campaigns and trips for all the families that 
need them. We are also looking at additional communities with sanitation needs. The more funds we raise, the more families we can help.  We need your financial support
 
For every $3000 we raise, we'll deploy ten more composting toilets. In this campaign, if we make our goal we could do two more sets.

Alcance Nicaragua is identifying participants in Los Alvarez and El Llanito.
Participants will contribute 40-50% of the total cost of the latrine over a period of 18-24 months
The goal is to build four composting toilets concurrently over four days (12 days to build 10)
Construction is tentatively scheduled from mid-August to September, 2014

If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds we do raise will be used to deliver as many composting toilets as we can. We are seeking other funding sources as well. If we exceed our funding goals, we will continue to work with our NGO partner on future trips to deliver toilets to all the families that need them including other communities.Your contribution will make a difference!
 Worldwide lack of sanitation is a major problem. Over 2.6 
billion people don’t have access to toilets. The pilot project was a success and the community wants 
and needs more. You can personally make a difference with your contribution.We thank you in advance for your support!!As a token of our appreciation we will gift you with one or more of the items below:Personalized certificate of appreciation, link to photos and videos of the implementation tripPDF copy of ""A Sewer Catastrophe Companion: Dry Toilets for Wet Disasters"",

  Risks & Challenges   The design changes from the pilot units need to be validated and user feedback must be collected and analyzed. Lessons learned will be documented and applied to future versions.

Τι είναι το εγχείρημα Τελαίθριον; 
(Scroll down for English)

Το εγχείρημα Τελαίθριον έχει ως στόχο την δημιουργία της
πρώτης, απόλυτα αναγκαίας, οίκο-κοινότητας στην Ελλάδα η οποία θα λειτουργήσει
ως σχολείο αυτάρκειας και ως πρότυπο μοντέλο, υγιών και αρμονικών συνθηκών ζωής
με σεβασμό στις ανθρώπινες αξίες και στο οικοσύστημα, ανανεώσιμες πηγές για
ενέργεια, καθαρά και αποτελεσματικά μέσα μεταφοράς, και συνεχή έρευνα και
εκπαίδευση σε όλα τα σχετικά θέματα και τεχνολογίες, τα οποία θα είναι
προσβάσιμα και διαθέσιμα σε όλους.
New Telaithrion Project Video

Το εγχείρημα λειτουργεί εδώ και περίπου 3 χρόνια με χιλιάδες επισκέπτες κάθε χρόνο από κάθε άκρη του πλανήτη. Μπορείτε να επισκεφτείτε την σελίδα μας στο facebook εδώ για να
βρείτε αναλυτικά φωτογραφικά άλμπουμ από όλα όσα έχουμε καταφέρει με την
πολύτιμη βοήθεια όλων όσων μας έχουν επισκεφτεί και συνεισφέρει το χρόνο τους
μέχρι τώρα. 


Τα
τελευταία νέα μας είναι ότι μόλις ολοκληρώσαμε το σκάψιμο για την δημιουργία
της λίμνης που θα βοηθήσει στην αλλαγή του κλίματος και την διαμόρφωση του
δασόκηπου φυσικής καλλιέργειας (φωτογραφίες εδώ). Επίσης μόλις ξεκίνησε η κατασκευή ενός ακόμη yurt (4ο κατά σειρά) το οποίο θα φέρει την πρακτική μας έρευνα στο 99% για τον συγκεκριμένο τύπο δόμησης (πολλές φωτογραφίες εδώ). Πολλά περισσότερα νέα στο News.FreeandReal.org
Περισσότερες πληροφορίες στα θέματα που ερευνούμε, τους στόχους μας, τις συνεργασίες μας και όλα όσα είναι το FreeandReal μπορείτε να βρείτε στο Telaithrion.freeandreal.org (σε 6 γλώσσες) και στο FreeandReal.org.
Με αυτή την καμπάνια και την ανεκτίμητη υποστήριξη σας, σκοπεύουμε να περάσουμε το εγχείρημα σε μία ακόμη επόμενη φάση!

Η συγκεκριμένη καμπάνια θα μαζέψει τα απαραίτητα κεφάλαια
που απαιτούνται για την ολοκλήρωση της δημιουργίας της λίμνης, εσωτερικά
(μεμβράνη, μονωτικά υλικά, πηλός κτλ) και εξωτερικά (φύτεμα φυτών και δέντρων
στις όχθες της και μεταφορά υλικού για ενίσχυση του εδάφους). Ακόμα θα βοηθήσει
για την ολοκλήρωση της κατασκευής του νέου Yurt (υλικά, μουσαμάς, μόνωση, κτλ)
και τέλος θα βοηθήσει σε μία ακόμη μεγάλη αγορά δέντρων η οποία
προγραμματίζεται να γίνει για φέτος τον χειμώνα για την επιτάχυνση της
δημιουργίας του δασόκηπου, ήδη έχουν φυτευτεί περισσότερα από 500 καρποφόρα και
μη δέντρα.
Θα είμαστε ακόμη ένα βήμα πιο κοντά στο όνειρο!
Το αντίκτυπο και γιατί τώρα;

Η ένταση στην οποία υποβάλλεται ο πλανήτης μας σήμερα δεν
μας αφήνει άλλη επιλογή από το να επανασχεδιάσουμε τον πολιτισμό μας και πιο
σημαντικά τους εαυτούς μας. Δεν υπάρχει καλύτερη στιγμή από το “τώρα” για να
αλλάξουμε τον τρόπο σκέψης μας και να προχωρήσουμε σε ένα πιο βιώσιμο και πιο
ισορροπημένο μέλλον.

«Μια εισβολή ολόκληρων στρατών μπορεί να αντισταθεί, αλλά όχι μία ιδέα της οποίας ο καιρός έχει έρθει», μας λέει ένα αγαπημένο απόσπασμα, και τώρα, περισσότερο από ποτέ, είναι προφανές ότι έχει έρθει η ώρα για μία συνειδητή αλλαγή παραδείγματος.



Το αντίκτυπο δεν μπορεί να μετρηθεί σε λόγια η αριθμούς, αλλά μέσα από τις αγκαλιές, τα χαμόγελα και τα καλά λόγια που λαμβάνουμε από τους ανθρώπους που μας επισκέπτονται και που προσφέρουν εθελοντικά τον χρόνο τους και την ενέργεια τους στο εγχείρημα καθ όλη την διάρκεια του χρόνου.
Φυτεύοντας μέσα μας, και μέσα τους, τους σπόρους της αλλαγής, παρακολουθούμε τόσο εμάς όσο και αυτούς, να προχωράμε προς ένα πιο υγιές, πιο ελεύθερο μέλλον!
Τι χρειαζόμαστε και τι κερδίζετε εσείς!
Αν το ποσό που συγκεντρωθεί, είναι λιγότερο από όσο απαιτείται, θα φυλαχτεί μέχρι να καταφέρουμε να μαζέψουμε ολόκληρο το ποσό από άλλες πιθανές πηγές 
(The 100th Monkey is coming...)
Παρακαλούμε δείτε tα μοναδικά πλεονεκτήματα που έχουμε δημιουργήσει για εσάς ως αντάλλαγμα για την συνεισφορά σας σε αυτή την καμπάνια στο δεξί μέρος αυτής της σελίδας.

""The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.” ―Socrates
(the Free and Real goodie bag for the 33 Euros perk!)



What is the Telaithrion Project?

The
Telaithrion Project’s mission is to create the first, much needed,
eco-community in Greece that will work as an exemplar model of sustainability,
healthy and harmonic living conditions with respect to human values and the
ecosystem,  renewable sources of energy,
clean and efficient means of transportation, continuous research and education
on all relevant topics and technologies, made available equally to all.




The project is taking place in Evia island for more
than 3 years now. Don't forget to visit our facebook page here to get
all the insight  from our course of
events from the very first day until today, and feast your eyes on the
countless photo albums depicting your own remarkable and priceless help for
everything that is being achieved. 

Our most
recent news are that we just finished digging and shaping the banks of the
artificial lake, which will change the climatic and environmental diversity
standards for the forest garden and the rest of the land around the community
(photos), and we also just started the construction of the 4th Yurt,
which will bring our practical research up to 95% regarding these amazing
shelters (photos). More news at News.FreeandReal.org

More information on the subjects that we research, our goals, our collaborations and everything that has to do with Free & Real can be found @ Telaithrion.freeandreal.org (in 6 languages) and @FreeandReal.org.

With
this fund raising campaign, and with your invaluable support, we aim to take
the project to its next crucial steps!
This
campaign will raise the necessary funds to complete the construction of the
artificial lake (geo-membrane, insulation, clay layers, banks support, etc) as
well as the planting of hundreds of trees around it plus enrichening of the
soil. It It will also cover the expenses for the completion of the new yurt
(cover, heat insulation, sound proofing, materials, etc). Last but not least,
it will  cover the expenses of our huge
seasonal effort to plant more than 500 new fruit trees in order to accelerate
the creation of the forest garden.

We will
be one step closer to the dream!

The Impact and Why Now? 

The
stress that is put upon our planet today leaves us no other option than to
redesign and recreate our culture and most importantly, ourselves. There is no better
time than today to change our way of thinking and move forward to a sustainable
and balanced future.


""An
invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come"", goes
the favourite quote, and now – more than ever – it is obvious that the time has
come for a conscious paradigm shift.

The impact cannot be measured in words or numbers, but rather through the hugs, smiles and kind words that we receive from the people visiting and volunteering their time and energy to our project throughout the entire year.
By planting inside us, and inside them, seeds of change, we watch both them and ourselves, walk towards a healthier, freer future!

What We Need & What You Get!

If the
amount raised, is less than that needed, it will be saved until we manage to
raise the entire amount from other possible sources, or even from running the
campaign again.
Please
see the unique perks we have created for you in return to donating to this
campaign on the right side of this page.
All the
process of this, as of the entire project, will be posted in our websites and
our social media.

<p><strong>The Vision.<br/></strong></p>
<p>I am a <strong>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Professional</strong>, with a Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies awarded by three universities in Europe (Institute for Geoinformatics Muenster Germany, Universitat Jaume I Castellon Spain and the New University of Lisbon, Portugal). I also hold a professional training certificate in <strong>Spatial ecology, Geospatial analysis and remote sensing for conservation</strong> awarded by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and George Mason University, Front Royal VA, USA. My interest and work is the application of GIS in environmental management and planning, and I have done this since 2004 after a BSc in Geography. Recent projects I have been involved in include the A.P.E.S. Database project (<a href=""http://apesportal.eva.mpg.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://apesportal.eva.mpg.de</a>) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany on which I serve as Data Coordinator, and the Arcus Foundation yearbook on Global Apes Welfare on which I worked as a freelance GIS specialist (I co-author a chapter for the publication).</p>
<p>I launched this campaign because of my plans / dream <strong>to start a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Laboratory focused on conservation science in Cameroon</strong>, one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. Cameroon attracts thousands of researchers from all over the world, who come in to study species distribution, animal behaviour forest management and degradation and other ecological processes. Students studying in the departments of Geogaphy and environmental sciences at the <strong>University of Buea</strong> (one of two anglo-saxon universities in the country) also go in to these programs with aspirations and dreams to acquire skills to contribute to analysis and protection of the rich natural resources of this country. However, they graduate without any practical knowledge of GIS and spatial analysis. Most of them have never even seen a GPS receiver before, which is a huge handicap for applied conservation in this region. Maps are still produced solely through freehand drawing. This is because there is no GIS training facility in the region. This negatively affects the quality of research by local researchers as well as the many foreign researchers who do not find much help or assistance in terms of GIS infrastructure and technology to facilitate their work (especially the many foreign graduate students who come in every year especially from Europe and the USA).</p>
<p>More than a year ago, another colleague and I traveled to <strong>the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, USA</strong> from Europe to attend training and acquire certification in <em><strong>Spatial ecology, Geospatial analysis and remote sensing for conservation</strong></em>. I was sponsored by the International Tropical Timber Organization, and this move was a step towards one goal - <strong>bring GIS knowledge and facilities to as many people in the tropics as possible</strong>. With your help, this will be made possible.</p>
<p><img alt=""Training at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://eecore.eecore.org/_images/_image_gallery/1.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;"" title=""Training at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute""/></p>
<p>At the end of the course, we nursed a plan on setting up a laboratory to benefit both students and foreign researchers in the area of natural resource management and conservation. The facility  will go a long way to meet the need for GIS technology in this biodiversity hotspot. Once the facility is set up, regular training will be organized for students and conservation professionals, assist researchers in Cartographic production, research design, data management, spatial analysis, satellite image processing, etc. It will also serve as a hub for foreigners coming in to the country by providing base maps for their use within the country and facilitating conservation research work.</p>
<p>I have worked in the forest in this region myself, focusing on the conservation of one of the most endangered ape species (the cross river gorilla). </p>
<p><img alt=""My research in the forests of Cameroon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://eecore.eecore.org/_images/_image_gallery/7.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;"" title=""My research in the forests of Cameroon""/></p>
<p>I witnessed firsthand the need for a GIS facility in the region, and I have suffered the absence of it.</p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will go towards purchase of software licenses (especially ArcGIS license from ESRI), desktop computers, a server, GPS receivers and furnishing the facility. Th idea is to work in collaboration with organizations such as EECORE Cameroon and the University of Buea.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over 1000 students graduate each year with degrees in Geography and environmental science at Buea University, but have never been exposed to a GPS receiver.
<p><img alt=""Collecting GIS data"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://eecore.eecore.org/_images/_image_gallery/9.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;"" title=""Collecting GIS data""/></p>
</li>
<li>Less than 20% of conservation organizations in Cameroon use GIS tools in their projects.</li>
<li>Thousands of students, both graduate and undergraduate travel to Cameroon annually from Europe and America to do research on wildlife and forest.</li>
<li>Cameroon is a home to some of the most critically endangered terrestrial species requiring much research attention.</li>
<li>Almost al research in conservation science is going spatial today?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need<br/></strong></p>
<p>The start-up phase of this project requires the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>10 desktop PCs running on Microsoft Windows OS, Pentium 4, intel core</li>
<li>2 laptop computers</li>
<li>5 GPS receivers</li>
<li>ArcGIS Server License from ESRI</li>
<li>Microsoft Office Suitelicense</li>
<li>Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for Cartographic production</li>
<li>A plotter</li>
<li>2 printers</li>
<li>A dedicated server for online data transfer</li>
<li>Furniture for facility.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is estimated that these will cost USD25000. If we do not meet this goal, we will reduce the number of equipment (eg reduce number of desktop PCs) and make use of more open source software if available (eg substitute ArcGIS with Quantum GIS, Microsoft office with Libre Office etc). </p>
<p><strong>International Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Having traveled to many parts of Europe and North America, I have made and kept contacts with many GIS professionals working in industry and academia. Our Spatial analysis laboratory will create ties with many of these professionals and build a strong network of international cooperation. It is also in plan to welcome foreign researchers annually and host them in this facility for joint collaborative research as well as independent work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>This will take research in conservation science in Cameroon and the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa years ahead of its current state. Students will graduate better equipped to protect some of the most luxuriant yet threatened forests in the world, professionals and foreign researcher will better find the assistance and collaboration they need in the region. Cameroon has every potential for making this a successful facility: it is very potically stable (one of the most peaceful countries in Africa), it is of growing interest to consevation research and it currently contains forests which can go a long way to solving current global climate and wildlife crisis.</p>
<p>I have experience running projects, and having worked with many organizations in the region, I have great connections to make this a fruitful project. The intention is to work in collaboration with the University of Buea, local NGOs such as EECORE Cameroon and international NGOs such as WCS and WWF. I am passionate about GIS tool and environmental application, and I want people who have the skills or potential to use them. I have great training and professional experience to carry develop training curricula, recruit trainers and to encourage trainees.</p>

<p> </p></div>","The Vision.
I am a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Professional, with a Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies awarded by three universities in Europe (Institute for Geoinformatics Muenster Germany, Universitat Jaume I Castellon Spain and the New University of Lisbon, Portugal). I also hold a professional training certificate in Spatial ecology, Geospatial analysis and remote sensing for conservation awarded by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and George Mason University, Front Royal VA, USA. My interest and work is the application of GIS in environmental management and planning, and I have done this since 2004 after a BSc in Geography. Recent projects I have been involved in include the A.P.E.S. Database project (http://apesportal.eva.mpg.de) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany on which I serve as Data Coordinator, and the Arcus Foundation yearbook on Global Apes Welfare on which I worked as a freelance GIS specialist (I co-author a chapter for the publication).
I launched this campaign because of my plans / dream to start a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Laboratory focused on conservation science in Cameroon, one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. Cameroon attracts thousands of researchers from all over the world, who come in to study species distribution, animal behaviour forest management and degradation and other ecological processes. Students studying in the departments of Geogaphy and environmental sciences at the University of Buea (one of two anglo-saxon universities in the country) also go in to these programs with aspirations and dreams to acquire skills to contribute to analysis and protection of the rich natural resources of this country. However, they graduate without any practical knowledge of GIS and spatial analysis. Most of them have never even seen a GPS receiver before, which is a huge handicap for applied conservation in this region. Maps are still produced solely through freehand drawing. This is because there is no GIS training facility in the region. This negatively affects the quality of research by local researchers as well as the many foreign researchers who do not find much help or assistance in terms of GIS infrastructure and technology to facilitate their work (especially the many foreign graduate students who come in every year especially from Europe and the USA).
More than a year ago, another colleague and I traveled to the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, USA from Europe to attend training and acquire certification in Spatial ecology, Geospatial analysis and remote sensing for conservation. I was sponsored by the International Tropical Timber Organization, and this move was a step towards one goal - bring GIS knowledge and facilities to as many people in the tropics as possible. With your help, this will be made possible.

At the end of the course, we nursed a plan on setting up a laboratory to benefit both students and foreign researchers in the area of natural resource management and conservation. The facility  will go a long way to meet the need for GIS technology in this biodiversity hotspot. Once the facility is set up, regular training will be organized for students and conservation professionals, assist researchers in Cartographic production, research design, data management, spatial analysis, satellite image processing, etc. It will also serve as a hub for foreigners coming in to the country by providing base maps for their use within the country and facilitating conservation research work.
I have worked in the forest in this region myself, focusing on the conservation of one of the most endangered ape species (the cross river gorilla). 

I witnessed firsthand the need for a GIS facility in the region, and I have suffered the absence of it.
Your contribution to this campaign will go towards purchase of software licenses (especially ArcGIS license from ESRI), desktop computers, a server, GPS receivers and furnishing the facility. Th idea is to work in collaboration with organizations such as EECORE Cameroon and the University of Buea.
Do you know?

Over 1000 students graduate each year with degrees in Geography and environmental science at Buea University, but have never been exposed to a GPS receiver.


Less than 20% of conservation organizations in Cameroon use GIS tools in their projects.
Thousands of students, both graduate and undergraduate travel to Cameroon annually from Europe and America to do research on wildlife and forest.
Cameroon is a home to some of the most critically endangered terrestrial species requiring much research attention.
Almost al research in conservation science is going spatial today?

What We Need
The start-up phase of this project requires the following:

10 desktop PCs running on Microsoft Windows OS, Pentium 4, intel core
2 laptop computers
5 GPS receivers
ArcGIS Server License from ESRI
Microsoft Office Suitelicense
Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for Cartographic production
A plotter
2 printers
A dedicated server for online data transfer
Furniture for facility.

It is estimated that these will cost USD25000. If we do not meet this goal, we will reduce the number of equipment (eg reduce number of desktop PCs) and make use of more open source software if available (eg substitute ArcGIS with Quantum GIS, Microsoft office with Libre Office etc). 
International Collaboration
Having traveled to many parts of Europe and North America, I have made and kept contacts with many GIS professionals working in industry and academia. Our Spatial analysis laboratory will create ties with many of these professionals and build a strong network of international cooperation. It is also in plan to welcome foreign researchers annually and host them in this facility for joint collaborative research as well as independent work.


The Impact


This will take research in conservation science in Cameroon and the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa years ahead of its current state. Students will graduate better equipped to protect some of the most luxuriant yet threatened forests in the world, professionals and foreign researcher will better find the assistance and collaboration they need in the region. Cameroon has every potential for making this a successful facility: it is very potically stable (one of the most peaceful countries in Africa), it is of growing interest to consevation research and it currently contains forests which can go a long way to solving current global climate and wildlife crisis.
I have experience running projects, and having worked with many organizations in the region, I have great connections to make this a fruitful project. The intention is to work in collaboration with the University of Buea, local NGOs such as EECORE Cameroon and international NGOs such as WCS and WWF. I am passionate about GIS tool and environmental application, and I want people who have the skills or potential to use them. I have great training and professional experience to carry develop training curricula, recruit trainers and to encourage trainees.

In fields such as navigation, spatial cognition, learning and memory, studies of songbirds and birdsong have proven valuable in many fields of science.</p>Songbirds (and other types
of birds) serve a hugely important role in our ecosystem. They help pollinate
plants, disperse seeds and even have a role in recycling nutrients back into
the earth. They are a real-time indicator of the state of the environment. <p></p>

<p><i><b>Why songbirds are

varied: They often become orphaned when they fall from their nests or fall victim to outdoor cats and other animals, they hit windows or
buildings, or have contracted an illness or infectious disease.</span></p>
<p>During a typical stay, each species
receives a specialized diet which mimics that which
they would find in the wild. Some eat a diet rich in insects and worms, others
rely more heavily on berries, greens, or seed. Orphaned babies are our most common patients in the spring/summer
months, and are fed on a 12-hour schedule, ranging from every 15 to 30 minutes. <br/><br/>Imagine a typical day in the Baby Bird Room: the staff and
volunteers prepare diets and then do round after round of feedings,
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Caretakers pack as many calories into the tiny little subjects
as the parent birds would do. Once self-feeding, youngsters are moved to
outdoor aviaries, where they can forage for meals and build up enough muscle for sustained flight. And then, once we are sure they are ready, the very best part of the
rehabilitation process takes place--<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> release to the wild for their second chance at freedom!</span></p>

The Center accepts over 5,000 wild birds, mammals and reptiles each year with the goal of release back to the wild.Cliff swallow fledglings clinging to a hand-knitted nestWhat is a songbird? Songbirds belong to a very large and diverse group of perching birds called Passeriformes; They comprise almost half of the 4,000 or so bird species worldwide. Each species has a developed vocal organ that can produce a sophisticated and often very beautiful birdsong. In fact, some species have even evolved their vocal songs into dialects, which can vary geographically (think Southern drawl or a New York accent)!In 2015, the Center admitted 2,907 birds out of  a total of 5,452 animals. Birds made up 107 different species; 51 of those, or 1,558 total birds, were classified as songbirds: American Crows, House Finches, Northern Mockingbirds and California Towhees; and other species quite rarely seen, such as a Pygmy Nuthatch, Hooded Oriole, Say’s Phoebe, Fox Sparrow and even a not-so-common Common Yellowthroat. Of our total intake of birds last year, 53% were—you guessed it – songbirds! You may begin to see that songbirds are very important local inhabitants and definitely deserve our attention.A trio of gaping Scrub Jays demanding to be fed

The need …  Believe it or not, it takes a huge team of just a few dedicated staff and many dozens of volunteers to accomplish the task of rehabilitating so many songbirds. Their needs are not complicated, but they can be costly. The Center is currently giving a badly needed makeover to our Baby Bird Room. We are in immediate need of three Animal Intensive Care incubators to replace very old ones that no longer work effectively. We need two large, free-standing shelving units that will help us get the room organized with much-needed supplies such as heating pads and microwavable saucers, thermal containers, medications and medical supplies such as vet wrap and syringes; and food, such as crickets, waxworms, mealworms, berries and other fruits, vegetables. 
WCSV needs to raise $10,000 to make these improvements and purchase the necessary supplies and food for the coming spring season. Can you help by donating even a small amount?  Every dollar will bring us closer to our goal and help provide outstanding care for our patients.

Why we love our
songbirds. If you enjoy watching birds as so many do, you know they bring
a little bit of the wild into our own backyards. Who doesn’t love to listen to
the birds singing in the early morning? They set the tone and enrich our lives
with their song.  How cool is it to see
such diversity right where we live—bright colors, distinct songs and
eye-catching displays. 
Frankly, who can resist the tiny hungry mouths of a gaping
Northern Mockingbird or an American Robin? Or the magnificent coloring of a
male House Finch, the masked bandit face of a Cedar Waxwing, or a nestful of
just-hatched Bushtits, barely bigger than a hummingbird.

Just why are songbirds important and what can they teach us? Songbirds are one of the most extensively studied groups in the field of animal behavior. In fields such as navigation, spatial cognition, learning and memory, studies of songbirds and birdsong have proven valuable in many fields of science.Songbirds (and other types
of birds) serve a hugely important role in our ecosystem. They help pollinate
plants, disperse seeds and even have a role in recycling nutrients back into
the earth. They are a real-time indicator of the state of the environment. 

Fledgling House Finches still sporting fuzzy heads
Why songbirds are
admitted and how they are rehabilitated. The reasons songbirds come to be patients are
varied: They often become orphaned when they fall from their nests or fall victim to outdoor cats and other animals, they hit windows or
buildings, or have contracted an illness or infectious disease.
During a typical stay, each species
receives a specialized diet which mimics that which
they would find in the wild. Some eat a diet rich in insects and worms, others
rely more heavily on berries, greens, or seed. Orphaned babies are our most common patients in the spring/summer
months, and are fed on a 12-hour schedule, ranging from every 15 to 30 minutes. Imagine a typical day in the Baby Bird Room: the staff and
volunteers prepare diets and then do round after round of feedings,
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Caretakers pack as many calories into the tiny little subjects
as the parent birds would do. Once self-feeding, youngsters are moved to
outdoor aviaries, where they can forage for meals and build up enough muscle for sustained flight. And then, once we are sure they are ready, the very best part of the
rehabilitation process takes place-- release to the wild for their second chance at freedom!

Every piece of plastic that has ever been produced will take between 450-1000 years to decompose (depending on the type of plastic).
Rubbish like this finds its way into canals and rivers and eventually the ocean.
Plastic in the ocean absorbs chemicals (pollution from shipping, industry and agriculture) very rapidly.
In the ocean plastic doesn't decompose but breaks down into tiny pieces called microplastics.
Microplastics are easily ingested by fish and marine birds.
The stomachs of sea animals fill up with non-digestible mass causing them to die of starvation.

All of the toxic chemicals which were absorbed and the inherent toxic chemicals in plastic (such as phalates) get into the fish's organs and tissue.
Toxic chemicals move up the food chain in a process called bioaccumulation, meaning that our dinner plates are contaminated with toxic, endocrine (hormone) disrupting chemicals.

In fact, we will have a digital display counter showing the amount of plastic which has been saved from landfill by customers using our shop. With your help we can make this become a reality by Spring 2018! There are a number of shops like this one around the world, one of the earliest being in.gredients in Austin, Texas, and the most recent being two in London and Totnes, this is the beginning of a plastic revolution. However there are only three currently in the UK and we need your help to bring it to Britain’s second city (although I think the best city) - Birmingham!Other Ways You Can Help
Please follow, like, share and retweet any posts that we make on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and use #zerowastebrum. This will help us reach as many people as possible who might want to back us.
Change your habits by buying some of the incredible biodegradable or non-disposable household products like bamboo toothbrushes and cotton buds, or reusable products like coffee cups, straws, cotton make-up pads, cotton shopping bag, metal water bottle and a cafetiere (rather than single-use coffee pods). Let's get this zero waste movement happening!

<h3>BACKGROUND:</h3>
<p>The Canary Islands are situated in a transit zone of dolphins and whales. The seabed is home to cold-water corals that host an abundance of marine wildlife, nearly one third of it endemic. The EU and UNESCO support initiatives to make the Canaries a model for sustainability. The Sustainable Development Program on the island of El Hierro is aimed at biodiversity and zero waste. El Hierro is set to become the world's first island to rely on 100% renewable energy (at an investment of 64 million euros financed via ENDESA). Its combined wind and hydropower system has reduced its annual energy costs by over three million euros. El Hierro is closely watched by members of the international community, and plans are in place to replicate its concept elsewhere. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>In this context, the Spanish government's decision to allow oil drilling just 9 km away from Fuerteventura and Lanzarote is difficult to understand – and simply wrong.</strong></p>
<p>The company behind the project, Repsol YPF Spain, says the oilrig would have a life of about 20 years and go to a depth between 3000 and 3500 metres. The drilling would affect an area of 616, 060 hectares to the east of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, some of which belongs to the Natural Reserve of Biosphere. Lanzarote and Fuerteventura are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The islands' drinking water comes from desalination of seawater. Oil drilling not only poses a threat due to accidental leakage, but also due to waste released into the sea as well as noise and disturbances from seismic testing, drilling, aircraft and ships. Dolphins and whales are especially harmed.</p>
<p><strong>Repsol tried the same project in 2001, but was stopped in 2004 by the Zapatero government. The Maritime International Organization declared this part of the ocean especially sensitive.</strong></p>
<p>If forecasts are confirmed, Repsol would produce 140,000 barrels a day. The profit would benefit private companies (Repsol YPF Spain, RWE Germany, and Woodside Petroleum Ltd. Australia). Jobs would go to specialised workers brought in by these corporations. The Canary Islands and their residents would be on the losing end.</p>
<p><strong>We can stop this insanity.</strong></p>
<p>By mobilising public awareness and sensitizing the international business community to the risks of the proposed oil drilling and to the opportunities presented by stopping it, we can make it politically untenable to go ahead with the drilling.</p>
<p>Protests have already united national institutions, NGOs, WWF, Greenpeace and art foundations – 35,000 people have taken to the streets. Companies investing in renewable energy objected in a letter to the government in Madrid. The European Commission (EC) launched an investigation (EU Pilot) and stated that an environmental impact assessment is required.  Scientists point to the real costs of fossil fuels including the environmental consequences.</p>

Sok helybéli illetve akár külföldi érdeklődőt is szívesen fogadnék hogy megnézze, körül járja a birtokot, akár igény esetén fáradtságát kipihenje a felújított tanyán.

<h3>Finances and where fundings go</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BeeScanning</strong> was initially funded from Kickstarter. Then from the EIP, European Innovation Program, and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, SBA, with about 3,5 million SEK (418 000 USD) For BeeScanning 2.0 ending 2020 we were granted 4 million SEK from SBA and 1 million SEK from Vinnova , National board for Innovations. Venture capital has been secured for future BeeScanning development during 2021. </li>
<li>
<strong>The Swarm</strong> needs fundings for initial set up of the project. Establishing the team, designing pilot projects, coordinating and organizing 4 driven specialist in AI, IT-system architecture, Agronomist and Forestry experts, insect breeding and beekeeping. An example that is in the works is monitoring production of protein from mealworms. The mealworms needs to be monitored to sort out deviations like dead, sick or abnormal larvaes on a conveyour belt or in a sorting machine. AI could do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>The major task for the team is to raise fundings for the coming years from similar sources as BeeScanning has managed to raise, mentioned above.</p>
<p>Here we ask for an initial stake 300 000 SEK (about 30 000 $). This is only about 10% of what will be needed for the total project. It will only suffice for a ""Kickstart""!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Spot on according to plan. BeeScanning 1.0 launched the first app feb 2018. It aimed to detect the varroa parasite and other features as finding the queen. 171219 decison came, project will be fully funded in step 1. We also submitted a new application for step 2 ""Monitoring a biological system"" and has fulfilled and developed our technology according to plan fully financed up until december 2020. May 2020 app version 2.0  launched and has attracted 6 000 users globally without marketing. The app has helped beekeepers globally to detect about 200 000 parasites saving thousands of colonies.<br/>Venture capital has secured further development of BeeScanning 2021. </p>
<p>For The Swarm we foresee allocating knowhow and resources from BeeScanning as well as a combination of financing options.<br/>Major risk to The Swarm is we fail to raise soft capital fundings from Swedish and European Innovation authorities during 2021. We have been informed there are great resources going into European Green Deal, Artificial Intelligence as well as efforts addressing pollination issues. We therefore feel very well positioned in many aspects.</p>

Then from the EIP, European Innovation Program, and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, SBA, with about 3,5 million SEK (418 000 USD) For BeeScanning 2.0 ending 2020 we were granted 4 million SEK from SBA and 1 million SEK from Vinnova , National board for Innovations. Venture capital has been secured for future BeeScanning development during 2021. 

The Swarm needs fundings for initial set up of the project. Establishing the team, designing pilot projects, coordinating and organizing 4 driven specialist in AI, IT-system architecture, Agronomist and Forestry experts, insect breeding and beekeeping. An example that is in the works is monitoring production of protein from mealworms. The mealworms needs to be monitored to sort out deviations like dead, sick or abnormal larvaes on a conveyour belt or in a sorting machine. AI could do that.

The major task for the team is to raise fundings for the coming years from similar sources as BeeScanning has managed to raise, mentioned above.
Here we ask for an initial stake 300 000 SEK (about 30 000 $). This is only about 10% of what will be needed for the total project. It will only suffice for a ""Kickstart""!

Perks
Most importantly of course is the fact you are sharing and showing insight to a major problem in the culture of our landscapes, and we will make that visible (if you agree to). Both on our site, our social media channels, in the lobby to be and with T-shirts.
 

We want you to engage you and give you the opportunity to influence how The Swarm develops. This goes for all levels of pledging and on higher levels we invite you to engage among our advisors.

Risks & Challenges
Spot on according to plan. BeeScanning 1.0 launched the first app feb 2018. It aimed to detect the varroa parasite and other features as finding the queen. 171219 decison came, project will be fully funded in step 1. We also submitted a new application for step 2 ""Monitoring a biological system"" and has fulfilled and developed our technology according to plan fully financed up until december 2020. May 2020 app version 2.0  launched and has attracted 6 000 users globally without marketing. The app has helped beekeepers globally to detect about 200 000 parasites saving thousands of colonies.Venture capital has secured further development of BeeScanning 2021. 
For The Swarm we foresee allocating knowhow and resources from BeeScanning as well as a combination of financing options.Major risk to The Swarm is we fail to raise soft capital fundings from Swedish and European Innovation authorities during 2021. We have been informed there are great resources going into European Green Deal, Artificial Intelligence as well as efforts addressing pollination issues. We therefore feel very well positioned in many aspects.

<p>Hi, I’m Raquel Gonzalez:</p>
<p>I'm president of Lompoc Cooperative Development Project.</p>
<p>We're working with six cooperatives in Santa Barbara County, California
to start more cooperative businesses. I’m convinced that if we as a nation are
going to avoid more episodes like The Great Recession, we need alternatives to
top-down Wall Street investor-driven business. We have been working hard to create social and
economic change in Santa Barbara County through the development of worker-owned
cooperative businesses that create sustainable jobs and promote life-changing
opportunities for unemployed and under-employed residents. 

</p>
<p>Worker cooperatives are owned and
democratically controlled by the workers. The worker cooperative is a
well-established, proven business structure with examples across the United
States, Canada and the world.  Cooperatives are appearing everywhere.
They’re inspiring and hopeful. We CAN make a difference.</p>
<p>In our local committee we have Isla Vista Food Co-op and
Santa Barbara Student Housing Co-op, both of them long-established. And we have
four small startup worker co-ops. One of them is a green cleaning business whose members/owners are mostly recently immigrated women of color. </p>
<p>To call attention to our work, we’re staging the first Santa
Barbara County Co-op Festival. It will be November 8, 2014 in Lompoc. We’ll have educational booths and workshops on cooperative
business models and economic justice.  We also want to ensure that the
event is attractive to people who are not familiar with cooperatives and to
families where children’s activities are important.  For this reason, we
will also have  dance<span> and music performances, and games. </span></p>
<p>All the cooperatives are contributing cash and volunteer
labor but we’re still a little short, about $1,800 short: enough to pay
for the interpreters (the whole event will be bilingual) and a few other things. </p>
<p>We can offer a tax deduction and cool perks: a professional
sleep study (if you live in our area), a bottle of non-toxic cleaning solution, a CD
of the event, ""I own a grocery store with my friends"" grocery bag and hand-painted bookmarks by artist Tonya Romano Schultz.</p>
<p>We’re pretty confident we’ll reach our goal, but in case we
don’t, since we can use whatever is sent, we’re choosing IndieGoGo’s flexible
plan.</p>
<p>Please make a little donation. Every dollar counts. It will help our event and contribute
to the nationwide movement toward a new economy based on grass-roots
cooperatives. World wide, cooperatives are such a growing force that the United
Nations named 2012 the Year of the Cooperative.  </p>
<p>If you can’t contribute, you can still help by putting out
the word about our lightning campaign to all your friends on Facebook and
anywhere. IndieGoGo provides share tools!</p>

<p>The <strong>Moving Market’s</strong> mission: to make healthy, sustainably grown, organic foods more affordable and accessible to communities -- especially low-income residents, senior citizens, and ""food desert areas"" (areas with low access to healthy foods) -- by selling directly to the people, year-round at wholesale cost. Nutrition and the benefits of buying fresh, locally grown produce will be an educational emphasis of these interactions.</p>
<p>Food is an integral part of our lives and the Moving Market would promote a connection to organic agro-forestry/farming methods. We are members of the World Wide Organization of Organic Farmers (WWOOF), with a variety of experience with farmer’s markets, and are currently helping out at Six Circles farm in upstate New York. Six Circles Farm is a certified naturally-grown farm that uses organic farming practices and is well-known in the area for its unique garlic scape pesto and strong garlic powder (<strong>both perks for donating!</strong>). Many of the farms we have worked on have an abundance of good, tastey, totally edible produce left over from market. Much of the left over food is composted, which is great for the soil, but we see an opportunity where we can take that good food to people who need it. <span><br/></span></p>
<p>The Moving Market is a cohesive plan that would encourage sustainability, reduction and prevention of waste, and community empowerment. We have purchased a bus that would allow us to travel and share produce that we have helped grow.  <strong>With your help</strong>, the <strong>Moving Market Bus</strong> can be repaired and converted to run on waste vegetable oil (wvo)—which would therefore allow us to reduce fossil fuel consumption, utilize otherwise-wasted vegetable oil, and deliver nutritious sustainably-grown food to communities. </p>

<p>In the developing world 3 billion people rely on biomass fuels such as wood and charcoal for cooking.  The burning of biomass in inefficient cookstoves produces life-threatening smoke.  Tragically, this kills nearly 2 million people each year - mostly women and children - more than double the number of deaths caused by malaria.  Harvesting fuelwood also drives devastating deforestation of tropical forests.</p>
<h3>BURN Design Lab</h3>
<p>BURN is a Vashon, WA non-profit founded by Peter Scott in 2010 to address this global issue.  Its mission is to save lives and forests in the developing world by designing and locally manufacturing clean burning cookstoves.</p>
<p>Peter has been designing fuel efficient cookstoves for the past 15 years and is considered a leading expert in the field.  In 1990, Peter committed his life to saving the forests of Africa.  Since that time, he has designed countless fuel efficient technologies.  He's trained producers in over 20 countries who have made over 500,000 tree saving technologies, such as clean cookstove and bread ovens.  His work has been featured in The New Yorker and on CNN. In 2010, he was chosen as one of Foreign Policy Magazine's 100 Top Global Thinkers. </p>
<h3>The Tank - A Clean Burning Stove</h3>
<p>In the last 18 months our team - in concert with Kenyan women - has created ""The Tank"", a new super fuel-efficient charcoal stove prototype. The stove uses 50% less fuel than the existing improved stove widely used in Kenya. The Tank is currently receiving rave reviews from cooks in Kenya and outperformed all other cookstoves in East Africa in recent independent trials. One woman has gone as far to say ""it's like cooking with gas!""</p>

<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<p>Over the three-year life of each Tank stove, it will avoid 7.5 tons of greenhouse gases (tCO2e), as well as saving 39 trees and saving end users as much as $540 in fuel costs!</p>
<h3>The Funding Gap - Our Indiegogo Plan</h3>
<p>A manufacturer is ready to locally produce The Tank in East Africa once it has been fully proven in the market.  They will produce 1.5 million Tank stoves over the next 10 years that will save 53 million trees and impact the lives of 8.3 million people.  </p>
<p>In order to turn The Tank into a market ready product, we need your help to meet our target of $20,000 to launch the product.  This investment directly targets pilot programs, market tests, focus groups and the purchase of key equipment.  With your help we will save millions of trees and impact millions of lives in East Africa!</p>

<h3>Want to Geek Out? - How it Works?</h3>
<p>We use basic principles of Heat Transfer, Combustion and Fluid Dynamics to make the super fuel-efficient Tank stove.  A batch of charcoal is loaded from the top and sits on a metal grate, similar to a Webber Grill.  The charcoal is lit igniting all of the fuel.  The combustion of charcoal naturally draws air through the ash-tray and below the fuel through the grate.  </p>

<li>As air travels over the hot ash-tray on its way to the combustion chamber, it is pre-heated to improve combustion</li>
<li>The air enters combustion chamber below the charcoal to give good mixing between the fuel and air to improve combustion  </li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>We are a pair of friends and amateur naturalists who are looking to get to South Africa next April. :) </p>
<p>Carrie is an Archivist who is studying to become a Scientific and Nature Illustrator, and Erika is a Graphic Designer who also draws and sells indie books for charity.</p>
<p>We were united, fairly recently, in fact, by our shared love of the natural world and drawing, and soon we realized that both of our life-long dreams have been to visit Africa and study the animals there closely in their natural environment. We found out about a program that will allow us to do just that, and we decided to try to go for it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we're not exactly well-off -- we both are thankfully employed, but we live in one of the most expensive places to live in the US, and neither of us are dentists or bankers. A huge portion of our earnings goes towards rent and it is difficult for us to save up any money for a trip, let alone one overseas.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We decided to apply for the Game Ranger Guide course with <a href=""http://www.conservationafrica.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">African Conservation Experience</a>, based in the UK. It is a highly regarded private volunteer placement organization.</p>
<p>The course will give us a thorough introduction to the wildlife, habitats and conservation issues of southern Africa, which will expand our knowledge and understanding of African fauna. In addition to it being an amazing experience, it will help us greatly with our ultimate dreams in life -- to work in a field related to helping animal conservation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Donating to us will not only help us have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to interact with animals in the wild and learn more about them, but will go towards a myriad of conservation and humanitarian efforts. ACE has always contributed to local communities that the volunteer placements are in, such as supporting the <a href=""http://ekapa.ioisa.org.za/module6/reserves/harmonyreserve.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Harmony Flats Working Group"">Harmony Flats Working Group</a>, helping build playgrounds and helping local soccer teams, and sponsoring local volunteers to take part in programs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Hello there!
We are a pair of friends and amateur naturalists who are looking to get to South Africa next April. :) 
Carrie is an Archivist who is studying to become a Scientific and Nature Illustrator, and Erika is a Graphic Designer who also draws and sells indie books for charity.
We were united, fairly recently, in fact, by our shared love of the natural world and drawing, and soon we realized that both of our life-long dreams have been to visit Africa and study the animals there closely in their natural environment. We found out about a program that will allow us to do just that, and we decided to try to go for it.
Unfortunately we're not exactly well-off -- we both are thankfully employed, but we live in one of the most expensive places to live in the US, and neither of us are dentists or bankers. A huge portion of our earnings goes towards rent and it is difficult for us to save up any money for a trip, let alone one overseas.


The Impact

We decided to apply for the Game Ranger Guide course with African Conservation Experience, based in the UK. It is a highly regarded private volunteer placement organization.
The course will give us a thorough introduction to the wildlife, habitats and conservation issues of southern Africa, which will expand our knowledge and understanding of African fauna. In addition to it being an amazing experience, it will help us greatly with our ultimate dreams in life -- to work in a field related to helping animal conservation.

Donating to us will not only help us have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to interact with animals in the wild and learn more about them, but will go towards a myriad of conservation and humanitarian efforts. ACE has always contributed to local communities that the volunteer placements are in, such as supporting the Harmony Flats Working Group, helping build playgrounds and helping local soccer teams, and sponsoring local volunteers to take part in programs.



What We Need & What You Get
We are not asking you to pay for transportation costs, but for the placement program itself. This will at least be $3000 for the two of us. I think we can at least scrape together enough money for a plane ticket there.
And the awesome thing? You will most definitely get something in return once you donate! Check out the list of perks.

Our Story
When books are written about the great transformations of the 21st century, the ideas and innovations that promote sustainability will be at the forefront.  Our greatest challenges lie in managing demand for scarce resources.

When our most vital resource - clean fresh water - is inaccessible to more than ten percent of the world's population, we know that more sustainable solutions are required.

Our goals are both modest and expansive.  We began as a class of students, seeking to make a difference, and inspired by the idea of social entrepreneurship.  We built a website and started to dream.

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.27em;"">We are deeply grateful to <strong>Jonathon Porritt</strong> for his endorsement of our project. Jonathon says:  “I really like this idea.

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Our Mission  </strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Coral reefs support over 500 million people, and harbour vital reserves of biodiversity that are crucial to current and future medicine. But reefs are being damaged on a global scale by storms, destructive fishing, ship groundings, making them even more susceptible to stresses such as pollution and ocean acidification. It can take many years to decades for them to heal.

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Restoration attempts currently take place on shallow reefs using  scuba divers attaching healthy coral back onto the reef. For example, s</span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">ee below two pictures provided by our colleague Lisa Carne from her highly successful ""Fragments of Hope"" Coral Nursery in Belize. The fist shows a healthy coral ecosystem in the seas around Belize, and the other shows divers working on the restoration of a damaged reef nearby.  Local fishermen and tour guides with expertise are vital to this success story, but such approaches cannot be used to repair reefs in deeper waters below about 600 feet where reefs also exist because of depth limits to humans diving. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Our answer: <strong>C</strong><em><strong>oralbots -</strong></em> autonomous undersea robots that will repair and restore damaged coral reefs.  When fully developed, coralbots will manipulate pieces of healthy corals (either scattered from their original position due to damage, or provided by a coral nursery), find appropriate places for these pieces to go in the original reef (to maximise the chances of regeneration), and then attach the fragment to the reef. This needs lots of adaptation and refinement of 'computational intelligence' algorithms around machine vision and robot control. All our developed and deployed algorithms will be <strong>open source</strong> (see <a href=""http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~dwcorne/coralbotsextra.html#open"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> here </a>).   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Coralbots idea is unique and transformative</strong></span> - current robotics applications in the marine world, as well as on land and sea, are almost entirely about surveillance, monitoring and exploration - basically, robots see and report back.  The potential for robots to make positive changes to the environment by manipulating it has not been considered until now. Apart from missions to restore coral reefs, a key motivation for our team is to inspire many further activities of this kind, which we believe will transform marine conservation forever. Small steps beyond our current plans, for example, will enable myriad other marine conservation missions, including different types of intervention in relation to coral reefs (e.g. inoculating the 'crown of thorns' starfish that has devastated the Great Barrier Reef), through to collection of marine litter that kills millions of marine animals and birds every year.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Below is the coralbot we will most likely buy (with manipulator included) with the equipment money recently raised, along with 3 smaller sea-surface robots for navigation and communication.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">    </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">State of the art research is starting to attach manipulators to such robots (e.g. to recover valuable archeological artefacts, or tighten valves in undersea installations). The coralbots team aim to exploit this developing technology in ways that revolutionize marine conservation, in missions that carefully manipulate aspects of the marine environment, accomplishing tasks that scuba divers currently attempt, but immensely more speedily, tirelesly, and  without danger to human lives. </span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Coralbots will be based on existing understea robot vehicles, with manipulators attached.

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What makes our longer term vision particularly exciting and effective is the idea of using <em>swarm intelligence </em>to control robot behaviour. Swarm intelligence explains how simple behaviours in a group of creatures can lead to complex and functional structures – this is how bees build hives, and termites build complex mounds, and beavers build dams.

We have a small part of a autonomous robotics equipment award shared between Heriot-Watt University (where most of us are) and Edinburgh University. See http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-23332184. This means we will be able to buy a dedicated coralbot for the project, but still need your donation to accelerate development and testing of the control software and much else!
We are deeply grateful to Jonathon Porritt for his endorsement of our project. Jonathon says:  “I really like this idea. The scale of damage to the world’s coral reefs is already so overwhelming that we will need an army of coralbots to get the restoration underway!” - Jonathon is a leading light in environmentalism; see his biography, affiliations and current activities  here 
Our Mission  Coral reefs support over 500 million people, and harbour vital reserves of biodiversity that are crucial to current and future medicine. But reefs are being damaged on a global scale by storms, destructive fishing, ship groundings, making them even more susceptible to stresses such as pollution and ocean acidification. It can take many years to decades for them to heal. Start to read more about the vital importance of coral reefs and their untempered decline  here. 
Restoration attempts currently take place on shallow reefs using  scuba divers attaching healthy coral back onto the reef. For example, see below two pictures provided by our colleague Lisa Carne from her highly successful ""Fragments of Hope"" Coral Nursery in Belize. The fist shows a healthy coral ecosystem in the seas around Belize, and the other shows divers working on the restoration of a damaged reef nearby.  Local fishermen and tour guides with expertise are vital to this success story, but such approaches cannot be used to repair reefs in deeper waters below about 600 feet where reefs also exist because of depth limits to humans diving. 
    
Our answer: Coralbots - autonomous undersea robots that will repair and restore damaged coral reefs.  When fully developed, coralbots will manipulate pieces of healthy corals (either scattered from their original position due to damage, or provided by a coral nursery), find appropriate places for these pieces to go in the original reef (to maximise the chances of regeneration), and then attach the fragment to the reef. This needs lots of adaptation and refinement of 'computational intelligence' algorithms around machine vision and robot control. All our developed and deployed algorithms will be open source (see  here ).   
The Coralbots idea is unique and transformative - current robotics applications in the marine world, as well as on land and sea, are almost entirely about surveillance, monitoring and exploration - basically, robots see and report back.  The potential for robots to make positive changes to the environment by manipulating it has not been considered until now. Apart from missions to restore coral reefs, a key motivation for our team is to inspire many further activities of this kind, which we believe will transform marine conservation forever. Small steps beyond our current plans, for example, will enable myriad other marine conservation missions, including different types of intervention in relation to coral reefs (e.g. inoculating the 'crown of thorns' starfish that has devastated the Great Barrier Reef), through to collection of marine litter that kills millions of marine animals and birds every year.  
Below is the coralbot we will most likely buy (with manipulator included) with the equipment money recently raised, along with 3 smaller sea-surface robots for navigation and communication.
 
 
    
State of the art research is starting to attach manipulators to such robots (e.g. to recover valuable archeological artefacts, or tighten valves in undersea installations). The coralbots team aim to exploit this developing technology in ways that revolutionize marine conservation, in missions that carefully manipulate aspects of the marine environment, accomplishing tasks that scuba divers currently attempt, but immensely more speedily, tirelesly, and  without danger to human lives. Coralbots will be based on existing understea robot vehicles, with manipulators attached. Below left, one view of a prototype coralbot, on the right: model of an existing up to date AUV (Nessie VII) with a manipulator arm attached.
What makes our longer term vision particularly exciting and effective is the idea of using swarm intelligence to control robot behaviour. Swarm intelligence explains how simple behaviours in a group of creatures can lead to complex and functional structures – this is how bees build hives, and termites build complex mounds, and beavers build dams. Read more about that  here.  
Who are we? The  core coralbots team are a group of scientists and engineers that have internationally leading expertise and immense experience in all of these things. Our areas are coral biology and regeneration (Lea-Anne Henry), autonomous underwater robots technology (David Lane and Dick Blidberg), artificial and swarm intelligence (David Corne), and video/image processing (Neil Robertson). Please see more about the core team and our extended team  here.
What you get: in addition to the obvious environmental and knock-on rewards we will all get, we are keen to provide whatever additional rewards we can for our backers. You will get thank you cards and/or videos, you can get your name on a coralbot, you can adopt a coralbot, get a coralbots game, you can have your name forever on a restored reef and more. We are also excited by and committed to global engagement in this programme - that means, working with our backers and involving you in the project itself. You can be a Coralbots Developer, or you can provide IT Support, and your school can engage with us and get exclusive updates.  The way all this translates into the 'perks' we can make availablle is on the right of the campaign page, and also explained further  here. 
What we need:  Recent success in other efforts from the team means we will soon be able to buy a new undersea robot, including a manipulator arm, dedicated to the project! We now need the funds to:


develop and refine the necessary 'computational intelligence', with an initial focus on recognizing and manipulating the species of corals in the damaged Belize reefs, and stable control and manipulation from the robot;


refine the software and hardware to mission-ready and produce first live demo in a public aquarium.
buy, and/or configure from existing equipment, an additional coralbot allowing us to demonstrate accelerated and co-operative restoration through 'swarm intelligence'  


cover transport, personnel and consumables costs (batteries) for first mission attempting to restore a damaged coral reef. 


Before launching in the deep sea, our first mission will take place in Belize where we can carefully monitor the coralbots performance safe in the knowledge that land is nearby! Future missions are destined from deep coral reefs off Scandinavia in about 300 feet of water. Your support will provide a conservation solution that paves the way for coral reef monitoring and restoration across the globe, as well as a wealth of additional marine conservation programmes that become enabled by minimal further adaptation to this technology. 
Here is roughly what will happen depending on the funds we raise with your help: 
below $30,000:  a qualified keen researcher costs $3000 per month, and to secure an excellent Masters student to do their project with us may cost anything from $200 to $2000 (if they need accomm). We will optimise the funds against these and similar resources and make as much progress as possible on the computational intelligence underpinnings. Much of the work here will be in experimentaion to find out how big a piece of coral can be manipulated, appropriate design of robot frame, achieving good co-ordination between vision and manipulation, and improving precision in placement. At $30,000  we expect be able to do what's necessary to achieve our first demonstration in a public aquarium, with at least one coralbot.  The nearer we get to $30,000, the more of the underpinning techniques will have been developed and refined, and additional fundraising efforts will soon get us there, but we may well be able to achieve a representative but limied-functionality demo before that.  
between $30,000 and $80,000 - with $80,000, we should be able to procure the person time and transport to achieve our first in-the-wild mission in Belize with a single coralbot.  OR, we can procure a suitably capable second coralbot, install/test the required additional computational intelligence, and demonstrate restoration activities with a co-operating 'swarm' of two coralbots in a public aquarium. There is sense in developing the swarm-based solution before the first tests, since this may significantly improve the impact of missions. Between $30,000 and $80,000 there are many possibilities, and what we might do will be affected by other factors - e.g. we may have been able to obtain additional equipment from other sources. In any case we will discuss the options with our Funders.  
between $80,000 and $120,000 -  at $120,000 we should be in a position to deliver a two-coralbot tets mission in Belize.  Between $80,000 and $120,000, as above, many options are available that we will discuss with our Funders,  but most likely we would be further refining the technologies, in simulation and with tank-testing, to prepare mission ready capability for Belize, Sweden and other sites.

SPECIFICSINTRODUCTION
In past roles as an entrepreneur, executive and artist I have driven an array of pressing objectives for technology startups and Fortune 500 brands alike. As an advocate for youth, our natural world, human potential and global sustainability, I have been alarmed by contemporary trends in global environmental concerns, societal behavior, growing economic disparity, immobility violent crime.
Associated contemporary science is abundant, clear and the need could not be more urgent. I felt compelled to do everything possible to use this insight to profoundly improve life trajectories and that of our natural world, for current and future generations. This ambition and possibility is actualized through Oceanseed Project. 
IMPACT
Specifically, science shows that a connection to the natural world enhances mental creativity, promotes wellness, creates powerful human bonds and fosters environmental stewardship, ultimately benefiting communities, businesses and economies.
Science additionally proves that the most profound impact on our communities, society and economies is attained through engaging the youngest of children and at-risk youth communities in particular, providing a societal return-on-investment of 7-10%, a figure that is now being revised and is expected to be closer to 12%.
Oceanseed Project seeks to utilize the funds raised through this campaign to do exactly that in the Santa Cruz, Monterey Bay, Pajaro River Valley, Santa Clara and Southern San Francisco Peninsula regions. With your help we can fully implement our field-based programs and begin to engage hundreds of targeted youth for a most profound and lasting impact on our communities, economies and natural world.
UNIQUE APPROACH
Our unique approach and transformative impact on individuals, communities and our world is predicated on Nobel laureate science and related research that proves to achieve these objectives programs need to be ongoing in nature, spanning a significant period of time and include a mix of experiential, self-guided and undirected experiences. Furthermore, science shows that individuals, families, communities and nature are all part of one eloquently connected Earth ecosystem system in which human citizenry is an imperative for all to live and thrive.
Oceanseed Project inspires and empowers at-risk youth by facilitating the establishment of their direct connection with our natural world through a place-based, experientially attained, understanding of and appreciation for our oceans, beaches, estuaries and watersheds, accompanying ongoing mentorship including academic guidance, discussion and exploration of family and community events.

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p align=""justify""><em>Our Horizon</em> is a registered non-profit organization that empowers people and communities to change the world. Our first campaign is a globally unprecedented approach to climate change: <em>we want to put warning labels on gas pump nozzles just like those on cigarette packages</em>.</p>
<p align=""justify"">We're asking municipalities across Canada to use their licensing powers to pass our idea into law. We have a game plan to take it global from there. It's time to get real about climate change. It's time to <strong><span style=""color: #3366ff;"">#FaceTheChange</span></strong>.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Founder and Executive Director Rob Shirkey has been concerned about climate change for all his life. When Rob's grandfather passed away last summer, his final words to him were ""Do what you love."" He left Rob a small sum of money that he used to launch <em>Our Horizon</em> in January of 2013. Since then, Rob has funded almost the entire project out of his own pocket and now needs your support.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Picture of Our Horizon supporters"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Indiegogo-group-shot.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h3>The Cross-Canada Tour</h3>
<p align=""justify"">We have conducted workshops at schools in Toronto for students to express their climate change concerns by designing their own warning labels. We also inspire participants to use their voices to make our idea real; we now have a growing list of youth who have committed to speak at Toronto City Hall when our motion is debated.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Student drawing warning label"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kid-draws-warning-label.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">We are taking our workshops from coast to coast this fall. Our objective is to inspire youth and give them the tools they need to advocate for the idea in their own communities. In the end, youth will inspire youth: every person that does a speech to their representatives at their City Hall and shares it on YouTube will be a hero. They will receive a <em>Climate Change Champion</em> medal from us in recognition of their courage.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Image of Climate Change Champion"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Climate-Change-Champion.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">We have hired a full-time tour coordinator and have a database with the contact information of every single elementary school, high school and environmentally-minded university club in Canada. It's going to be a lot of work but we're dedicated to making this happen.</p>
<h3>The Warning Labels</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Our use of fossil fuels has dangerously altered the basic chemistry of our planet. Addressing climate change is the greatest challenge of our time.</p>
<p align=""justify""><img alt=""Warning label: Ocean acidifcation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Labelhigh-Oceans.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img alt=""Warning label: Asthma"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ourhorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Labellow-Health-Risks.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">The labels show the effects of climate change right in the palm of your hand. They are a catalyst. Our idea will cause some individuals to change their behaviour but, more importantly, they will result in a shift in our collective demand to allow for real action on climate change.</p>

<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Citizens in countries all over the world have been cognitively primed for our idea with the warning labels already on tobacco packages. The first communities to pass our by-law will set a precedent for the world to follow. This campaign is the first step in our larger vision of putting these labels on gas pumps all over the world.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Your contribution can help make this happen. With this campaign, you have the opportunity to change the course of human history. The best perk of all isn't the stuff listed to the right, it's this: you will get to tell your children and grandchildren that your contribution helped change the world.</p>

Our Campaign
Our Horizon is a registered non-profit organization that empowers people and communities to change the world. Our first campaign is a globally unprecedented approach to climate change: we want to put warning labels on gas pump nozzles just like those on cigarette packages.
We're asking municipalities across Canada to use their licensing powers to pass our idea into law. We have a game plan to take it global from there. It's time to get real about climate change. It's time to #FaceTheChange.

   

Our Story
Founder and Executive Director Rob Shirkey has been concerned about climate change for all his life. When Rob's grandfather passed away last summer, his final words to him were ""Do what you love."" He left Rob a small sum of money that he used to launch Our Horizon in January of 2013. Since then, Rob has funded almost the entire project out of his own pocket and now needs your support.
 
The Cross-Canada Tour
We have conducted workshops at schools in Toronto for students to express their climate change concerns by designing their own warning labels. We also inspire participants to use their voices to make our idea real; we now have a growing list of youth who have committed to speak at Toronto City Hall when our motion is debated.

We are taking our workshops from coast to coast this fall. Our objective is to inspire youth and give them the tools they need to advocate for the idea in their own communities. In the end, youth will inspire youth: every person that does a speech to their representatives at their City Hall and shares it on YouTube will be a hero. They will receive a Climate Change Champion medal from us in recognition of their courage.

We have hired a full-time tour coordinator and have a database with the contact information of every single elementary school, high school and environmentally-minded university club in Canada. It's going to be a lot of work but we're dedicated to making this happen.
The Warning Labels
Our use of fossil fuels has dangerously altered the basic chemistry of our planet. Addressing climate change is the greatest challenge of our time.
   
The labels show the effects of climate change right in the palm of your hand. They are a catalyst. Our idea will cause some individuals to change their behaviour but, more importantly, they will result in a shift in our collective demand to allow for real action on climate change.

Your Contribution
Citizens in countries all over the world have been cognitively primed for our idea with the warning labels already on tobacco packages. The first communities to pass our by-law will set a precedent for the world to follow. This campaign is the first step in our larger vision of putting these labels on gas pumps all over the world.
Your contribution can help make this happen. With this campaign, you have the opportunity to change the course of human history. The best perk of all isn't the stuff listed to the right, it's this: you will get to tell your children and grandchildren that your contribution helped change the world.

Thank you for your support!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hi, we're Novotera. We're embarking on this Indiegogo crowdsource fundraiser to distribute 1,000 of our new <strong>CarbonStove</strong> hybrid-biochar cooking stoves to remote villages in China, Thailand, and Indonesia during fall 2012.</p>
<p>Over 2 billion people cook indoors with inefficient wood fires causing deforestation, climate change and, according to the World Health Organization, more than 5000 premature-deaths <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">a day</span> due to smoke inhalation. After two years of working with Chinese villages to develop our stoves, we have finalized the design, and our manufacturer is ready to go into production.</p>
<p><strong>CarbonStove helps to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce indoor cooking smoke to a minimum.</li>
<li>Mitigate air-born soot, which is responsible for 5-10% of man-made global warming.</li>
<li>Reduce deforestation by increasing stove efficiency; villages reported using roughly 1/3 less wood than with traditional stoves.</li>
<li>Sequester carbon (in the form of biochar) within the soil. </li>
<li>Improve the soil structure and drought resistance.</li>
<li>Improve the financial situation and living conditions of rural populations.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>How Does  it Work?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>The <strong>Carbon</strong>Stove is a TLUD, which means ""Top-lit Updraft.""</strong></p>
<p>With a TLUD stove, you light kindling on top of a densely packed bundle of wood in a vertical tube nested inside a larger tube. Because the airflow is restricted, the fire on top heats the wood with very little oxygen, and the result is gases come streaming out of the wood; mostly hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. The gases rise towards the top, where they encounter jets of oxygenated air drawn through the gap between the tubes. When the gases meet, they ignite and burn just like a regular, clean-burning gas stove. </p>
<p>What's left once you ""gasify"" wood, is charcoal, which when put into the earth, is Biochar. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Biochar is Essentially Buried Charcoal</strong></span></p>
<p>The agricultural benefits of burying charcoal have been understood for millennia in the Far East, but in the rest of the world this ancient knowledge was forgotten. While most of the Amazon’s soils are poor and thin, there are scattered patches of deep, fertile soil called ""Terra Preta"". In the late 90’s these soils were shown to have been caused by natives intentionally burying charcoal thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>When Charcoal is created in a controlled environment for agricultural application it is called biochar. A natural soil enhancer, biochar significantly boosts plant growth and root development when used properly, improves soil water retention and permeability, reduces soil acidity, helps to retains nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil, and encourages beneficial micro-organisms. <strong>Recent biochar soil-treatment trials have shown a doubling and sometimes even a tripling of crop yields.</strong> And of course, when you mix biochar in your soil, you're sequestering carbon and thus really doing something about climate change.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes Our <strong>Carbon</strong>Stove So Unique:</strong></p>
<p>CarbonStove was designed to use locally purchased firewood, so unlike other available biochar-producing stoves, ours does not require villagers to re-cut their wood. <br/>The CarbonStove is a hybrid. It is a fully functional TLUD, but since a TLUD stove sometimes only burns for an hour, we added a door making it similar to a <strong>“Rocket Stove”</strong>, a more traditional high-efficiency stove being used in development work.  The benefit of this hybrid is that once there's no gas left in wood, villagers can add as more wood. This allows a family to cook for hours, even once the initial gasification is complete. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><strong>Carbon</strong>Stove Economics:</strong></span></p>
<p>Biochar stoves provide villagers with the opportunity to earn extra money. A <strong>Carbonstove</strong> can produce one Kilo of charcoal for each three Kilos of wood fuel, both of which sell for three RMB in parts of China. The stove thus produces a valuable product that can be used by the owner for further cooking, for sale, or for soil improvement.

<p> </p></div>","Hi, we're Novotera. We're embarking on this Indiegogo crowdsource fundraiser to distribute 1,000 of our new CarbonStove hybrid-biochar cooking stoves to remote villages in China, Thailand, and Indonesia during fall 2012.
Over 2 billion people cook indoors with inefficient wood fires causing deforestation, climate change and, according to the World Health Organization, more than 5000 premature-deaths a day due to smoke inhalation. After two years of working with Chinese villages to develop our stoves, we have finalized the design, and our manufacturer is ready to go into production.
CarbonStove helps to:

Reduce indoor cooking smoke to a minimum.
Mitigate air-born soot, which is responsible for 5-10% of man-made global warming.
Reduce deforestation by increasing stove efficiency; villages reported using roughly 1/3 less wood than with traditional stoves.
Sequester carbon (in the form of biochar) within the soil. 
Improve the soil structure and drought resistance.
Improve the financial situation and living conditions of rural populations.

How Does  it Work?
The CarbonStove is a TLUD, which means ""Top-lit Updraft.""
With a TLUD stove, you light kindling on top of a densely packed bundle of wood in a vertical tube nested inside a larger tube. Because the airflow is restricted, the fire on top heats the wood with very little oxygen, and the result is gases come streaming out of the wood; mostly hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. The gases rise towards the top, where they encounter jets of oxygenated air drawn through the gap between the tubes. When the gases meet, they ignite and burn just like a regular, clean-burning gas stove. 
What's left once you ""gasify"" wood, is charcoal, which when put into the earth, is Biochar. 
Biochar is Essentially Buried Charcoal
The agricultural benefits of burying charcoal have been understood for millennia in the Far East, but in the rest of the world this ancient knowledge was forgotten. While most of the Amazon’s soils are poor and thin, there are scattered patches of deep, fertile soil called ""Terra Preta"". In the late 90’s these soils were shown to have been caused by natives intentionally burying charcoal thousands of years ago.
When Charcoal is created in a controlled environment for agricultural application it is called biochar. A natural soil enhancer, biochar significantly boosts plant growth and root development when used properly, improves soil water retention and permeability, reduces soil acidity, helps to retains nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil, and encourages beneficial micro-organisms. Recent biochar soil-treatment trials have shown a doubling and sometimes even a tripling of crop yields. And of course, when you mix biochar in your soil, you're sequestering carbon and thus really doing something about climate change.
What Makes Our CarbonStove So Unique:
CarbonStove was designed to use locally purchased firewood, so unlike other available biochar-producing stoves, ours does not require villagers to re-cut their wood. The CarbonStove is a hybrid. It is a fully functional TLUD, but since a TLUD stove sometimes only burns for an hour, we added a door making it similar to a “Rocket Stove”, a more traditional high-efficiency stove being used in development work.  The benefit of this hybrid is that once there's no gas left in wood, villagers can add as more wood. This allows a family to cook for hours, even once the initial gasification is complete. 
CarbonStove Economics:
Biochar stoves provide villagers with the opportunity to earn extra money. A Carbonstove can produce one Kilo of charcoal for each three Kilos of wood fuel, both of which sell for three RMB in parts of China. The stove thus produces a valuable product that can be used by the owner for further cooking, for sale, or for soil improvement. Wood that a villager would have burnt anyway for cooking can thus provide further benefit without extra cost, other than the stove. Ideally, farmers will bury the biochar in the soil and reap the long term economic benefits of bigger and healthier crops, but whatever the user chooses to do, the economic and health benefits of producing biochar with cooking stoves are significant.
The stoves presently cost 25$ to produce in Kunming China, but shipping to other more remote customers is our biggest hurdle. Shipping costs vary greatly depending on the customer’s location.
Marketing:
For the past two years we have been in China testing out our stoves, getting feedback from villagers and modifying the stoves to better suit people's needs. The thing which first impresses villagers is how our fire looks and acts like a gas fire. They like the high heat which it gives off as well as the lack of smoke.
We employ a range of distributors, including village leaders. Such people are well situated to distribute due to their position of respect within the community, and their connections with other nearby communities. Cookstove dealers as well as pot and pan sellers are another important type of distributor, as are restaurant owners. Sometimes local farmers also see the business opportunity although they often need more credit support.
WHAT WE NEED:We are heading back to China this autumn, and with our finalized design our goal is to get a thousand of our new stoves into the hands of rural people in East Asia before the year is out.

<h3>Worm Poop and Charcoal!</h3>
<p>An article published by the International Biochar Institute at Cornell University claims that we need to bury 2.2 billion tons of carbon in the soil every year until 2054 to restore our atmospheric CO2 levels to 2004 conditions. If every gardener improves their soil with <strong>biochar</strong> this will have a big impact on climate change. <strong>Biochar </strong>alone can have some bad side effects in your soil, but when combined with the rich organic beneficial microorganisms in vermicompost the results have been remarkable.</p>
<p>For over ten years I have been retired and promoting the conversion of organic waste with medium-sized vermiculture for the urban gardener. Sales of my vermicompost at Farmers Markets barely covered the cost of production. I wrote a book ""<em>Beyond Compost</em>"" that has been translated into ""<em>Mas Alla del Compost</em>"". I have told the story to garden clubs and schools. A year ago I learned about ""<strong>biochar</strong>"", or horticultural charcoal, and the benefits observed in Brazil for thousands of years (<strong><em>Terra Preta del Indios</em></strong>) and started a company to blend these ingredients into <em><strong>""BioPreta""</strong></em>.</p>
<p>During 2012 my wife and I travelled around Michigan selling our 5-quart ""TeaPot"" to indoor garden supply stores. I attended many more Farmers Markets and found that most gardeners had not heard of ""<strong>biochar""</strong>. The <strong>need for education</strong> was obvious. We sold enough to break even, in spite of the rising costs of transportation.</p>
<p>This week, my largest customer asked me to provide free samples to hand out to hundreds of indoor gardeners at a conference where they will have a booth. People will travel long distances to this conference and there will be over 1000 participants who are passionate about growing plants indoors. The experiences growers have had who have added one-cup of <em><strong>""BioPreta""</strong></em> to a cubic foot of potting mix are remarkable, and we believe these small one-cup samples will launch a large demand for <strong>biochar <em>and</em> vermicompost</strong>.</p>
<p>It will be a serious financial strain for us to provide these free samples, but your help to support us will be very much appreciated and has the potential to make a big difference for our grandkids and yours.</p>
<p>Look up the subject of <strong>biochar</strong> on YouTube (<em>The Promise of Biochar</em>, and others). Read about it in the <em>National Geographic</em>. Mention this unique product to your friends and fellow gardeners. Maybe they could help with a donation, as well.</p>

<p>Hi My Name is Matt Wright and I am the Managing Director of ShoppaBox Limited.  I have spent the last 15 years buying and selling products on Shopping TV and through Mail Order, Internet &amp; Printed Media.  Tired of the corporate life and wanting to make a positive impact on the world I decided to do something about it…</p>
<p>My product is called MyBuddy-Box...  Truly A Box For Life!  (<a href=""http://www.mybuddy-box.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mybuddy-box.com</a>) Based on an original 1984 award winning version invented by my father but never commercialised I wanted to start my own business and felt I could update and improve the original design and its functionality to address the worldwide environmental concerns over plastic environmental pollution, especially the pollution caused by discarded single use plastic carriers.  I am a start-up business and have just occupied a small manufacturing unit in Peterborough here in the UK where this British designed product is now manufactured by me from 100% recycled plastic waste.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">So Here’s My Pitch….  </span></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>“ Did You Know That More Than <em>8 Billion</em> (58,000 Tonnes) Of  Polluting Carriers Are Dumped In The UK Each Year?  Surely This Has To Stop?  What We Need Is To Mobilise An Army Of Everyday Heroes !! “</strong></p>
<p>May I introduce a way to dramatically reduce demand for those billions of environmentally unfriendly (but useful) humble carriers which – when dumped – will kill wildlife, pollute our landscape, rivers and seas and create a dangerous legacy for generations to come as they do not degrade over time?</p>
<p align=""center""><strong> “MyBuddy-Box” ... Truly A Box For Life - A Perfect Solution ! “</strong></p>
<p>So serious is this worldwide threat to our environment that people here in the UK are urging our government to levy a 10-20pence tax in England (already introduced in Wales and most recently in Northern Ireland) for each carrier given away by supermarkets and other retailers in an attempt to force us to change our behaviour.  I think <strong>MyBuddy-Box</strong> could be part of an alternative practical solution.  Your involvement will be a game changing positive step to address this growing disaster.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>“Is It Really Possible To Re-Invent The Wheel ... Or Box </strong>?  <strong><em>ABSOLUTELY</em> ! !”</strong></p>
<p><strong>MyBuddy-Box </strong>is British designed and made in the UK from 100% recycled waste plastic and is 100% recyclable and will last a lifetime .. guaranteed!.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>“So Many Uses ! “</strong></p>
<p><strong>MyBuddy-Box </strong>can be used for your grocery shopping, laundry, filing, storage or many other practical everyday uses.   It’s a simple, easy-to-use, reliable folding box and is incredibly durable and strong yet lightweight, weighing around 800gms, it can carry up to 20kg! Following the principles of origami, it folds down from a rigid box into a chic, contemporary and desirable ‘briefcase’ when not in use.  The secret to its strength is the ‘living hinge’ which means it can be safely folded up and down tens of thousands of times, enabling <strong>MyBuddy-Box </strong>to be guaranteedfor a lifetime!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>“Using it For Grocery Shopping?”</strong></p>
<p>Just hang it on the trolley as you shop the store and at checkout simply open in seconds, place in the trolley and fill.  If you have a lot of shopping, you can safely stack one on top of another in the trolley to wheel back to your car.  When home, empty and simply fold down ready for your next shopping trip or to use around the home.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">So Why Do I Need Your Help??</span></strong></p>
<p>At the moment I am personally producing each box by hand in an industrial unit in Peterborough – although I am producing a high quality product it is not very cost effective and is keeping the retail price higher than I believe it should be – with your help I can buy new machinery to be able to mass produce these boxes here in the UK, not only bringing the cost down making it affordable for everyone, but also creating new UK jobs for local people.</p>
<p>With your help I can centralise production of all of the components taking out cost and the environmental damage of shipping multiple parts from multiple locations – this will make production cheaper, more efficient and ultimately bring the price of MyBuddy-Box down so there are no excuses for everyone not to own at least one!  This will not only take out 1,000s of tonnes of plastic waste from landfill, but will also help stop the waste and pollution of single use carrier bags – together we can make a difference!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
<p>I am looking to raise £60,000 to purchase two semi automatic ultrasonic welding machines to weld each box much more cost effectively into the super strong finished product here in the UK (each box currently requires 16 individual welds).  Once we have the production streamlined we can not only address the UK’s plastic pollution problem but take on the world – this truly is a product with no boundaries and could make such a difference to the worldwide pollution problems!</p>

Hi My Name is Matt Wright and I am the Managing Director of ShoppaBox Limited.  I have spent the last 15 years buying and selling products on Shopping TV and through Mail Order, Internet & Printed Media.  Tired of the corporate life and wanting to make a positive impact on the world I decided to do something about it…
My product is called MyBuddy-Box...  Truly A Box For Life!  (www.mybuddy-box.com) Based on an original 1984 award winning version invented by my father but never commercialised I wanted to start my own business and felt I could update and improve the original design and its functionality to address the worldwide environmental concerns over plastic environmental pollution, especially the pollution caused by discarded single use plastic carriers.  I am a start-up business and have just occupied a small manufacturing unit in Peterborough here in the UK where this British designed product is now manufactured by me from 100% recycled plastic waste.
So Here’s My Pitch….  
“ Did You Know That More Than 8 Billion (58,000 Tonnes) Of  Polluting Carriers Are Dumped In The UK Each Year?  Surely This Has To Stop?  What We Need Is To Mobilise An Army Of Everyday Heroes !! “
May I introduce a way to dramatically reduce demand for those billions of environmentally unfriendly (but useful) humble carriers which – when dumped – will kill wildlife, pollute our landscape, rivers and seas and create a dangerous legacy for generations to come as they do not degrade over time?
 “MyBuddy-Box” ... Truly A Box For Life - A Perfect Solution ! “
So serious is this worldwide threat to our environment that people here in the UK are urging our government to levy a 10-20pence tax in England (already introduced in Wales and most recently in Northern Ireland) for each carrier given away by supermarkets and other retailers in an attempt to force us to change our behaviour.  I think MyBuddy-Box could be part of an alternative practical solution.  Your involvement will be a game changing positive step to address this growing disaster.
“Is It Really Possible To Re-Invent The Wheel ... Or Box ?  ABSOLUTELY ! !”
MyBuddy-Box is British designed and made in the UK from 100% recycled waste plastic and is 100% recyclable and will last a lifetime .. guaranteed!.
“So Many Uses ! “
MyBuddy-Box can be used for your grocery shopping, laundry, filing, storage or many other practical everyday uses.   It’s a simple, easy-to-use, reliable folding box and is incredibly durable and strong yet lightweight, weighing around 800gms, it can carry up to 20kg! Following the principles of origami, it folds down from a rigid box into a chic, contemporary and desirable ‘briefcase’ when not in use.  The secret to its strength is the ‘living hinge’ which means it can be safely folded up and down tens of thousands of times, enabling MyBuddy-Box to be guaranteedfor a lifetime!
“Using it For Grocery Shopping?”
Just hang it on the trolley as you shop the store and at checkout simply open in seconds, place in the trolley and fill.  If you have a lot of shopping, you can safely stack one on top of another in the trolley to wheel back to your car.  When home, empty and simply fold down ready for your next shopping trip or to use around the home.
 
So Why Do I Need Your Help??
At the moment I am personally producing each box by hand in an industrial unit in Peterborough – although I am producing a high quality product it is not very cost effective and is keeping the retail price higher than I believe it should be – with your help I can buy new machinery to be able to mass produce these boxes here in the UK, not only bringing the cost down making it affordable for everyone, but also creating new UK jobs for local people.
With your help I can centralise production of all of the components taking out cost and the environmental damage of shipping multiple parts from multiple locations – this will make production cheaper, more efficient and ultimately bring the price of MyBuddy-Box down so there are no excuses for everyone not to own at least one!  This will not only take out 1,000s of tonnes of plastic waste from landfill, but will also help stop the waste and pollution of single use carrier bags – together we can make a difference!
 
What I Need & What You Get
I am looking to raise £60,000 to purchase two semi automatic ultrasonic welding machines to weld each box much more cost effectively into the super strong finished product here in the UK (each box currently requires 16 individual welds).  Once we have the production streamlined we can not only address the UK’s plastic pollution problem but take on the world – this truly is a product with no boundaries and could make such a difference to the worldwide pollution problems!

Please note for any donations outside of the UK for the £30 and upwards perks I will have to ask for an extra donation of £25 to cover international courier charges.
Estimated delivery of perks within 30 days of the completion of the funding round.

You really can help me in many ways – firstly in bringing the production cost down to reduce the selling cost, so making it a no-brainer for everyone to use – secondly by spreading the word – it is a brand new and unique product and very few people know it exists – everyone who has seen it and used it loves it and I am sure you will too – please help spread the word in any way you can – word of mouth, Twitter, Facebook, Newspaper & Magazine Articles any way you can!  With your help we can take MyBuddy-Box worldwide reducing plastic waste, pollution and the massive environmental impact that comes with it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a resident of Northridge, CA, in the heart of the San Fernando Valley (near CSUN). I've lived here most of my life and recently came across some information about our local environment (and the environment of our country at large), which was of great concern to me. Allegations made by several experts in the fields of meteorology, environmental science, and geo-engineering, contend that weather modification efforts in CA are resulting in alarming levels of heavy metals, in micronized form, raining down on us every day.</p>
<p>Here are my two sources:</p>
<p>""What In The World Are They Spraying?""</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf0khstYDLA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf0khstYDLA</a></p>
<p>""Why In The World Are They Spraying?""</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEfJO0-cTis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEfJO0-cTis</a></p>
<p>The scientists in the video stated that the best time to collect a sample is on a rainy day after a heavy ""spray day"". So I followed some online instructions on how to collect rainwater and recently (5/5/13) captured about a half-inch of rain and consolidated it into a vessel containing about 1 pint of liquid.</p>
<p>I contacted a local lab to test it, but the cost was prohibitive ($75 per each element; aluminum, barium, and selenium). I asked if he could swing a discount for a concerned citizen, and he said couldn't do it, but he suggested I contact a local university, which led me to CSUN. After several requests I have reached the conclusion that they [CSUN] are not willing or able to help me; which is what has led me to indiegogo.com and to YOU.</p>
<p>It is understood that there are many other more worthy causes to support on indiegogo.com as opposed to helping some ""conspiracy-analyst"" confirm data, but I am hoping that you might share my concern for this potentially catastrophic practice that is going on right over our heads every day.</p>
<p>In advance, I thank you for your consideration of funding this project, and I'm looking forward to working with you in verifying or dispelling these horrific claims.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>So here's the deal: The test(s) for each of the three heavy metals (Aluminum, Barium, Strontnium), at $75 per, will cost a total of $225. The minimum amount indigogo will allow me to campaign for is $500, which is more than twice what is needed. I have chosen the ""Flexible Funding"" option, which allows me to keep the funds raised even if they don't meet my goal, at a rate of a 9% fee (4% if I do).</p>
<p>If the goal is reached (or exceeded), the funds will be used to assist in presenting the lab results to local elected representatives (City, State, Federal), also known as ""lobbying"". Funds will be used to supplement income for the day(s) taken off of work to do so, and for travel expenses. It is also planned to contact Ana Garcia, an investigative reporter at NBC News LA, to present the findings. Additionally the results will be shared ""press release-style"" to many other news media outlets across the country.</p>
<p>In sum, what you'll get is the truth; and if that truth turns out to be as horrific as I suspect, you will have somebody fighting for your very life!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal here is to do much more than raise a little money to run some lab tests. On a larger scale, the goal is to stop weather modifaction efforts over California and eventually nation-wide. The biggest benefit is that we will all cease to be bombared by heavy metals. Perhaps the ever-increasing rates of cancer will begin to recede; or the number of children born with autism will begin to fall. Who knows?</p>
<p>I have experience in making an impact in my community. From 2001 through 2009, I helped safely deliver nearly 45,000 intoxicated drivers home in their own vehicles, free of charge, across the State of California, when I co-founded and operated the Designated Drivers Association. During that time I also successfuly lobbied for an amendment to California law to allow us to conduct background checks of our prospective drivers through the CA Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Since that time I helped to identify and shut down the ""Overdraft Protection"" racket being run by Bank of America, educating many in the process as to how to recover their stolen money from the bank(s). Here's the incriminating evidence: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR0unK2aYE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIR0unK2aYE</a></p>
<p>I've always been one to stand up to bullies; one to protect those who are unable to to protect themselves. In this case, there are various ""bullies"" involved in what is most likely a deadly practice agaisnt an unsuspecting, unprotected, public. And I'm here to put a stop to that. </p>

<div>This was a very hard experience in many ways, especially as some of my fellow activists faced some very legitimate police brutality, but it was also a very empowering one.  The trust and communication that was established between the people who participated was incredible and the support offered by my fellow comrades within the jail and folks on the outside made me feel as safe as possible in such an oppressive and violent setting.

Hi, I'm Carol Armstrong, Founder of The Island Rescue Project. We are a small group of passionate volunteers who are working to improve the lives of babies in Kiribati. 


Babies are defenseless and need our protection.  But we need your help to do this.
The water supply of Kiribati is rainwater that seeps underground through the porous coral and forms a bubble of fresh water that they draw from through wells. Unfortunately, everything else above ground also leaches through to the water supply: pig droppings, toilet pit leakage and other decaying material. Their polluted water is a potential source of disease.


Clean water is essential. Without mountains or rivers, rain is the only source of water and sometimes there is drought. We need to harvest water from the sea through industrial sized solar de-salination panels and home sized units.
The main island of Tarawa is approximately 16 km squared, with a population of more than 50,000 people. 
Sometimes when a baby is born, there is not enough water at the hospital to wash the baby clean.

Our team is ready to travel to the islands to introduce water purification strategies, water storage plus education and remedies for diarrhoea.


Do you know that just $30 will provide safe clean water to a child for 3 years or more? Just $10 per year or approximately 20 cents a week. You can make this real for a young child by donating $30 for a Lifestraw personal water filter, which will filter our 99.99% of bacteria, virus and parasites.

If anyone is still able to donate, all additional proceeds will go directly towards printing costs enabling us to make copies of the guide available for local schools and environmental organizations! Thank you everyone so much for making this project possible!</span></h4><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><br/></span></div><h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">The Project</span><br/>
</h3><p></p><p>The transboundary Grenadine islands are divided between the small
island developing states (SIDS) of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada,
and derive their economies largely from foreign tourism and fisheries. These
50+ islands and cays (the largest of which is only 32 km<sup>2</sup>) are biologically
rich and diverse, yet extremely fragile and vulnerable to environmental change
and developmental pressures. In an area where there is an
increasingly intense demand for such little space, we strive to encourage
both foreign and community-driven stewardship of species and their habitats. To do this, we are in the process of creating a comprehensive, user-friendly avian field guide, which includes scientific and local ecological knowledge (LEK) and folklore from Grenadine citizens, and showcases a collection of photographs taken within the Caribbean. This guide will be a valuable resource for training local bird monitors, educating the general public, promoting sustainable tourism initiatives, enhancing the overall conservation and management of Grenadine resources, and will be useful to both locals and foreigners with an interest in the avifauna of the region.</p>
<p>Specific goals for this project are to:</p><ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Preserve LEK and cultural
heritage unique to the Grenadine islands;</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Instill a sense of pride, ownership, and community-driven stewardship for the natural resources of the Grenadines;</span></li>
<li>Educate tourists about the natural history of the region, while promoting Grenadines-specific environmentally conscious and sustainable tourism initiatives;<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Produce a valuable resource for
local participation in conservation and management initiatives (e.g. monitoring)
by compiling several regionally specific multi-disciplinary datasets; and</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Continue the existing momentum of participatory research
and community outreach in the region.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are very grateful for the assistance provided to us thus far by <a href=""http://www.birdscaribbean.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>BirdsCaribbean</a> (formerly the Society for the Conservation and Study of Caribbean Birds) and <a href=""http://www.epicislands.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Protection in the Caribbean</a> (EPIC), as well as towards all of the photographers who have graciously donated images featured in the guide. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For more information about this project, the Grenadines, and

Existing datasets, including a comprehensive list of birds, their descriptions and photos, have been compiled into a near-complete draft of the field guide. We believe that the success of this project however, lies in the documentation and incorporation of local ecological knowledge (LEK) to ensure that the guide is truly representative of the culture of the Grenadines, as well as useful to its citizens. To do this, we will conduct a two-week LEK collection effort, involving meetings with individuals and small groups spanning the nine—distinctly unique—inhabited islands, of the transboundary Grenadines. Themes we wish to explore include population trends, behavior, range and distributions, as well as local folklore about birds (e.g. notable birding spots and unique stories from <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the perspectives of local citizens). </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As a volunteer-run project, we need financial support to enable us to complete this final stage!  Your generous donations will cover costs associated with travel to and within the islands, and room and board expenses during the two-week LEK collection.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">During this time, we would also like to take the opportunity to share our own knowledge of avian conservation and management issues by providing a complimentary workshop for locals on the adverse effects of marine debris, while introducing creative and locally feasible strategies to address the issue. Marine debris, an issue in which plastics predominate, is distributed throughout the world's oceans, arriving at even the most remote beaches and islands. It has been shown to cause injury and mortality to over 260 marine wildlife species worldwide (particularly seabirds) through entanglement, smothering, and ingestion. Although there are annual beach clean-up events on some islands in the Grenadines, the coastal areas continue to be cluttered with marine debris.

If anyone is still able to donate, all additional proceeds will go directly towards printing costs enabling us to make copies of the guide available for local schools and environmental organizations! Thank you everyone so much for making this project possible!
The Project
The transboundary Grenadine islands are divided between the small
island developing states (SIDS) of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada,
and derive their economies largely from foreign tourism and fisheries. These
50+ islands and cays (the largest of which is only 32 km2) are biologically
rich and diverse, yet extremely fragile and vulnerable to environmental change
and developmental pressures. In an area where there is an
increasingly intense demand for such little space, we strive to encourage
both foreign and community-driven stewardship of species and their habitats. To do this, we are in the process of creating a comprehensive, user-friendly avian field guide, which includes scientific and local ecological knowledge (LEK) and folklore from Grenadine citizens, and showcases a collection of photographs taken within the Caribbean. This guide will be a valuable resource for training local bird monitors, educating the general public, promoting sustainable tourism initiatives, enhancing the overall conservation and management of Grenadine resources, and will be useful to both locals and foreigners with an interest in the avifauna of the region.
Specific goals for this project are to:
Preserve LEK and cultural
heritage unique to the Grenadine islands;
Instill a sense of pride, ownership, and community-driven stewardship for the natural resources of the Grenadines;
Educate tourists about the natural history of the region, while promoting Grenadines-specific environmentally conscious and sustainable tourism initiatives;

Produce a valuable resource for
local participation in conservation and management initiatives (e.g. monitoring)
by compiling several regionally specific multi-disciplinary datasets; and
Continue the existing momentum of participatory research
and community outreach in the region.
We are very grateful for the assistance provided to us thus far by BirdsCaribbean (formerly the Society for the Conservation and Study of Caribbean Birds) and Environmental Protection in the Caribbean (EPIC), as well as towards all of the photographers who have graciously donated images featured in the guide. For more information about this project, the Grenadines, and
birds, please visit our website: Birds of the Transboundary Grenadines or contact us directly at grenadinesbirds@gmail.com.What We NeedThis project is an entirely volunteer-driven effort that has been underway for over a year. Existing datasets, including a comprehensive list of birds, their descriptions and photos, have been compiled into a near-complete draft of the field guide. We believe that the success of this project however, lies in the documentation and incorporation of local ecological knowledge (LEK) to ensure that the guide is truly representative of the culture of the Grenadines, as well as useful to its citizens. To do this, we will conduct a two-week LEK collection effort, involving meetings with individuals and small groups spanning the nine—distinctly unique—inhabited islands, of the transboundary Grenadines. Themes we wish to explore include population trends, behavior, range and distributions, as well as local folklore about birds (e.g. notable birding spots and unique stories from the perspectives of local citizens). As a volunteer-run project, we need financial support to enable us to complete this final stage!  Your generous donations will cover costs associated with travel to and within the islands, and room and board expenses during the two-week LEK collection.During this time, we would also like to take the opportunity to share our own knowledge of avian conservation and management issues by providing a complimentary workshop for locals on the adverse effects of marine debris, while introducing creative and locally feasible strategies to address the issue. Marine debris, an issue in which plastics predominate, is distributed throughout the world's oceans, arriving at even the most remote beaches and islands. It has been shown to cause injury and mortality to over 260 marine wildlife species worldwide (particularly seabirds) through entanglement, smothering, and ingestion. Although there are annual beach clean-up events on some islands in the Grenadines, the coastal areas continue to be cluttered with marine debris. Combining our interests in avian conservation and community outreach, we will host a workshop with local handicraft vendors to both demonstrate techniques and facilitate discussions on how to incorporate marine plastics and beach debris into marketable handicrafts directed at the tourism industry. This workshop is intended to provide incentives for local stewardship of marine and coastal areas, while simultaneously improving the livelihoods of locals.We are also actively securing funds to print these guides. Although partial funding to print the final draft of the guide has been secured, any money that we raise over our goal will enable us to print more guides, and to provide Grenadine locals involved in this project with free/affordable copies. The balance on these additional printing costs is not included in our funding goal at this time.The TeamJuliana Coffey, BA, MREM (Project Lead, Ethnobiologist/ Ornithologist): Juliana lived on Union Island in 2011 while working as the Marine and Coastal Coordinator at the Sustainable Grenadines Inc. through the Canadian International Development Association program (CIDA).

began in 2012 as an initiative of Les Herbes Folles Association and it has been
a member of the Green Film Network since 2013. Twenty-seven film festivals

“Gasland” (USA, 2012) winner of the first PELICAM trophy in 2012, “My Name is Salt” (Switzerland/India, 2013) winner of the third PELICAM trophy in 2014,
“Pipeline” (Russia/Czech Republic/Germany, 2013) dir. Vitaly Mansky, “Amazon
Gold” (USA, 2012) dir. Reuben Aaronson, 
“More Than Honey” (Switzerland, 2013) dir. Markus Imhoof , winner of the
Berlinale Silver Bear in 2013, “La Soif Du Monde” dir. Yann Arthus Bertrand,
“Aral, The Lost Sea” dir. Isabel Coixet (director nominated for the Cannes
Palme d’Or and the Berlinale Golden Bear) and  “Gone Wild” (Romania, 2012) by Dan Curean.
60
special guests attended Pelicam in 2014, bringing a valuable contribution to
the debates and activities of the Festival: film directors Cristi Puiu
(Romania), Klaus Drexel (France), Stefano Martone (Italy), Jan van den Berg
(The Netherlands), Carl Fechner (Germany) and others; anthropologists Michael
Stewart (UK) and Vintilă Mihăilescu (Romania); Ivan Patzaichin, Olympic

Residents have been seen collecting the oil by hand and with buckets to sell for a small reward to the state run Padma Oil company, while fishermen attempt to use their nets to contain the spill. This is one of the most fragile and delicate ecosystems on the planet and home to much beloved creatures like river dolphins and the royal Bengal tiger.""

</h3>Food production in the U.S. begs for a new paradigm in land tenure in America to reduce urban dis-ease, expand healthy food production and to foster contemporary rural families and lifestyles!  Wayne hopes to optimize the conditions for a farm-based 
eco-village at White Buffalo Farm to support restorative livelihoods and expand agrarian education.  A 
farm-based eco-village moves towards ""resettling"" America!<br/><br/>We are working on developing a replicable proto-type essential at 
this time in the agrarian movement. We need communitarian agriculture 
rather than sole proprietorship to rebuild farming and distributive land
 tenure.  We will disburse campaign funds for staff development, 
farm clean up, outreach and building management and communications 
competency in a start up eco-village management group!  Thank you!<br/><br/>Helping us now offers a chance to raise awareness about farm-based eco-villages.  If not at White Buffalo, then elsewhere!   Keep in mind, Wayne cannot ensure the farm will become a farm-based ecovillage.  Financial matters are pressing and Wayne is dependent on farm crew volunteers.  One can try!<br/><br/>Let's grow a movement that includes equitable land distribution!  Wayne
 is open to offers on the farm lower than the list price for a vision 
and team that moves towards demonstrating a communitarian approach to farming with pooled resources to protect resources like the state's oldest organic fruit orchard or pure agricultural water!<br/><br/>Learn more about a model for communitarian farm-based livelihood on the <a href=""http://www.whitebuffalofarm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>White Buffalo Farm website</a> under the column heading, ""Sustainability.""  <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>About the Farm's Owner and Founder</h3><p></p><p>Wayne pioneered organic fruit production on Colorado's western slope with other back to landers in the early 1970s.  They opened markets for organics in Colorado and beyond.  He is the last man standing from those days as all of his fellow farmers moved on to other livelihoods long ago.  </p><p>Wayne's children are not able to farm in Colorado and so arises the question of who to carry on the legacy?  Who is the best possible next owner of White Buffalo Farm?  <br/></p><p>Wayne's story is soon to be told in a comic strip loosely based on the stories he shares with interns and farmers market goers alike!  The fun-loving comic strip is full of wry wit and gentle grace to be ""aired"" in weekly comic strip installments!  Stay tuned to the stories of ""Paradox Farm and the Peacenik Warrior.""   Even now, the creative process is unfolding in the hip earthy cafes of Long Beach, California.  Wow!  Stayed tuned ~

</p><p></p><h3>Pioneering Organic Farm for Sale</h3>Who is the best possible next owner of White Buffalo Farm?  A great buyer for the farm would extend operations on the farm to 
benefit the region, generate wholesome livelihood for more than a few, 
offer delicious and nutritious local organic foods and other goods, 
maintain the farm's natural beauty and expand the number of visitors and
 youth that can visit the farm for restorative experience.  <br/><br/>Through this Indiegogo campaign, Wayne hopes more people learn about the 
farm and this wonderful opportunity to farm in a story book place!  Now 
the growing season is coming to an end, Wayne is ready to talk with the 
Ute Nations, foundations and others.  He seeks to open conversations on 
how best to benefit healing and restoration during these difficult times
 through living, visiting or working on this extraordinary farm. <p>Wayne plans to sell to the optimal buyer when the conditions are ripe.  
He hopes whoever buys the farm moves towards developing a farm-based 
ecovillage.  Sale of the farm could also lead to other sustainable possibilities. <br/></p><p>The farm could be sold to 1) a tribal body 
""first peoples"" who develop an ecovillage with the added benefit of youth programs near a wilderness setting; 2) a foundation may permit the development 
of small-scale organic agriculture programming on a Colorado fruit farm;  or, 3) a good, wonderful, extended family 
providing a hopeful family model in these times when families are often 
fractured in the striving for upward mobility.  Whoever meets Wayne's sense of what is best, may the outcome provide 
powerful restorative benefits for all.  Learn more about the farm on the <a href=""http://www.whitebuffalofarm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>farm's website</a> and in <a href=""http://www.landandfarm.com/property/Colorado_s_Oldest_Organic_Farm_for_Sale-1051441/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our property listing.</a>  Please spread the word! </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need<br/>

this time in the agrarian movement. We need communitarian agriculture 
rather than sole proprietorship to rebuild farming and distributive land
 tenure.  We will disburse campaign funds for staff development, 
farm clean up, outreach and building management and communications 
competency in a start up eco-village management group!  Thank you!Helping us now offers a chance to raise awareness about farm-based eco-villages.  If not at White Buffalo, then elsewhere!   Keep in mind, Wayne cannot ensure the farm will become a farm-based ecovillage.  Financial matters are pressing and Wayne is dependent on farm crew volunteers.  One can try!Let's grow a movement that includes equitable land distribution!  Wayne
 is open to offers on the farm lower than the list price for a vision 
and team that moves towards demonstrating a communitarian approach to farming with pooled resources to protect resources like the state's oldest organic fruit orchard or pure agricultural water!Learn more about a model for communitarian farm-based livelihood on the White Buffalo Farm website under the column heading, ""Sustainability.""  About the Farm's Owner and FounderWayne pioneered organic fruit production on Colorado's western slope with other back to landers in the early 1970s.  They opened markets for organics in Colorado and beyond.  He is the last man standing from those days as all of his fellow farmers moved on to other livelihoods long ago.  Wayne's children are not able to farm in Colorado and so arises the question of who to carry on the legacy?  Who is the best possible next owner of White Buffalo Farm?  Wayne's story is soon to be told in a comic strip loosely based on the stories he shares with interns and farmers market goers alike!  The fun-loving comic strip is full of wry wit and gentle grace to be ""aired"" in weekly comic strip installments!  Stay tuned to the stories of ""Paradox Farm and the Peacenik Warrior.""   Even now, the creative process is unfolding in the hip earthy cafes of Long Beach, California.  Wow!  Stayed tuned ~

Pioneering Organic Farm for SaleWho is the best possible next owner of White Buffalo Farm?  A great buyer for the farm would extend operations on the farm to 
benefit the region, generate wholesome livelihood for more than a few, 
offer delicious and nutritious local organic foods and other goods, 
maintain the farm's natural beauty and expand the number of visitors and
 youth that can visit the farm for restorative experience.  Through this Indiegogo campaign, Wayne hopes more people learn about the 
farm and this wonderful opportunity to farm in a story book place!  Now 
the growing season is coming to an end, Wayne is ready to talk with the 
Ute Nations, foundations and others.  He seeks to open conversations on 
how best to benefit healing and restoration during these difficult times
 through living, visiting or working on this extraordinary farm. Wayne plans to sell to the optimal buyer when the conditions are ripe.  
He hopes whoever buys the farm moves towards developing a farm-based 
ecovillage.  Sale of the farm could also lead to other sustainable possibilities. The farm could be sold to 1) a tribal body 
""first peoples"" who develop an ecovillage with the added benefit of youth programs near a wilderness setting; 2) a foundation may permit the development 
of small-scale organic agriculture programming on a Colorado fruit farm;  or, 3) a good, wonderful, extended family 
providing a hopeful family model in these times when families are often 
fractured in the striving for upward mobility.  Whoever meets Wayne's sense of what is best, may the outcome provide 
powerful restorative benefits for all.  Learn more about the farm on the farm's website and in our property listing.  Please spread the word! What We Need
Your help now covers staff development and operational expenses as Wayne
 keeps the farm producing food through the winter.  Wayne grows greens 
and lettuces during our long, but sunny Colorado winters in his 
geo-thermal grow tunnels!2013 was a difficult
 growing season to due both a late freeze of the cherry crop and an 
early freeze of the tomato crop.  In addition, June rolled out blazing 
hot impacting germination of lettuces and greens for our farmers 
market.  It was a challenging year to farm!  Good thing they are not all
 like that!Operating expenses to feed and shelter the current residents on the farm who keep farm operations in full swing exceeds $3000 per month.  We are currently short by $1000 a month, but expect to restore revenues through our Community Supported Agriculture program by February 2014.Seven Other Ways You Can Help1)  Encourage your friends to donate to ensure the farm's best possible transition!   Please share our campaign with friends and have them sign up for our email newsletter either on the White Buffalo Farm website or through the farm's Facebook page.2) If you or your friends live in our region, check out our CSA!3) Wayne is accepting loans of $1000 or more which he will plan to repay at 12.5% interest from the proceeds of the sale of the farm.  To learn more, visit the peer-to-peer lending platform the farm is using to administer loan agreements.  Please also send a message to Myriem, the fund raising campaign lead, or Wayne to discuss details.  You can reach us both by clicking on our profile below.4) Offer an auction item for our upcoming online auction:  CDs, Books, Poetry, Jewelry, Art, Artisan Goods, Services, Dining, Travel, Tickets, Health, Fitness.  For ideas check out a recent online auction held by Esalen.  You benefit by exposure to our wonderful group of farm friends!  We benefit by reaching our fund raising goals!  5)  Can you host a house party to raise awareness and do fund raising to support our hopes for the farm?  We can send you everything you need to have a lovely party and feel good about your connection to the farm!  Call or write for details.6) Seasoned Vegetable Manager 2014.  Wayne seeks a deeply-knowledgeable vegetable manager-educator for the 2014 growing season.  Learn more about our programs on our website.  Wayne welcomes interns and apprentices for 2014.  Updated information will soon appear in our Growfood.org and Wwoof listings.  We also post occasionally in goodfoodjobs.org  Even now, you can write wltalmage@tds.net for a 2014 WBF staff, intern or apprentice infosheet to complete and return to the farm.7)  Stay tuned!  We plan ongoing fund raising campaigns to make up revenue shortfalls 
through the winter to ensure the farm is in tip top shape for the 2014 
growing season and for the new owners of the farm.  Spread the word!  Thank you!Farm Gift Baskets for You!
As perks, we have lovely organic farm-made items for you to share during the holidays!  Enjoy the first comic of ""Paradox Farm and the Peacenik Warrior,"" exquisite eco-ethical yarns and knits, as well as uniquely divine artisan small batch USDA organic fruit preserves by a French-American local foods master....and, Happy Thanksgiving everyone!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>****UPDATE****</h3>
<p>101 Celsius was selected as a finalist for the Global Cleantech Cluster Association Late Stage Awards, we'll be competing in Atlanta Oct 28, 2013. Thank you to the judges at the Chicago Clean Energy Alliance compettion for selecting us as a finalist.</p>
<h3>***UPDATE 2****</h3>
<p>We are removing the name of the organization that selected the TAC-Q to help remove any confusion that this fundraisig campaign is for anything other than to raise funds to bring two patent pending components into the commercail market.  I also understand that some people feel that there should be a video narration included in this campaign, I agree, my accountant did not.  If you want a feel for our efforts so far, please check out our website, LinkedIn or FB pages.</p>
<h3>101 Celsius' Tac-Q system was chosen from over 128 designs for testing against two --- designs that each received $125K grants to develop. 101 Celsius did not receive any grant money to develop the Tac-Q  system. </h3>
<h3>Your help brings two components of this system into the commercial solar market place and allows us to build version 2 of this system to keep competing. We designed the Tac-Q system for Relief agencies and the military realized two components solve several issues that have delayed or prevented commercial solar thermal systems from being installed.</h3>
<p>The Tac-Q provides hot water for showers and kitchens in deployed areas and can be used to create potable water.  This reduces fuel usage and the need for re-supply convoys, the leading cause of casualties.Tac-Q v2.0 removes weight, speeds and simplifies installations and has two components that transforms the commercial solar market.</p>
<p>101 Celsius llc, is a developer of solar thermal systems for industrial, commercial and residential systems.  We designed the Tac-Q system for the Military and Relief agencies and realized two components solve several issues that have delayed or prevented commercial solar thermal systems from being installed.  The mounting system increases thermal output, reduces wind loading and the need for structural modifications to buildings.  The mounting system maximizes Solar A/C Systems in the summer and Solar heating systems in the winter and allows systems to be installed on wall, flat roof or pitched roofs.  The DC powered pump station allows the system to operate where electricity is expensive and can be used world-wide regardless of Grid voltage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Product design is a hard category to fund, so I've made as many gifts, systems, and options to buy systems available as possible.  If you have a gift idea you'd like to see please don't be shy. </p>
<p>To prove we are devoted to providing low carbon solutions where ever possible.  I organized the 101 Celsius Electrified and Alt-fueled vehicle Rally in Chicago.  It was the first  EV rally held in below freezing weather and the first to re-create the 1895 Times-Herald race using EVs.  14 electrified vehicles and trucks, and one VW Passat TDI participated in the Rally.  Details can be found at the FB page of 101 Celsius dot com, or the Goggle plus page.</p>
<p>Need More details:</p>
<p>Every donation and ounce of energy goes to pushing the improvement in technology and getting more solar thermal systems installed so that we create a self perpetuating chain reaction of installed low carbon solutions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of the mounting system nearly doubles the output of the collectors and allows one collector system to power Solar A/C in summer and Solar heating systems in the winter.  The mounting allows solar thermal systems to beat Hydraulically Fracked Natural-gas at it's current low price, allows systems to be easily installed on roofs without structural modifications including Hurricane regions.</p>
<p>The DC Pump station allows systems to operate independent of the Electrical grid and can be used where the system is co-located with PV systems, allowing both system types to operate most efficiently.</p>
<p>Short term the system will help in Disaster relief and military operations where 70 percent of casualties are the result of resupply operations, where water is the primary good delivered.  Making water on site and reducing fuel consumption allows the military to resupply by air and further reduce casualties.  The leading cause of death in Disaster areas is often water borne diseases, not the actual event. By boiling the water most pathogens are destroyed.</p>
<p>Long term the system will be used to develop the solar resources of the world by increasing the sites available to install solar systems.  The Tac-Q system and technology works well from the equator to the polar areas.  Other system types ie; Concentrators require high direct solar insolation and do not work well outside the tropics.</p>
<p>Version 2 will be substituted during the testing phase as the changes, are to equipment other than the Collectors and does not change the Energy Yields just the speed of deployment &amp; Shipping and weight reduction.  The same companies I used to build the first prototype will be used to build Version 2.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>To hire a Project manager for the commercial and residential systems that are going to be generated from this campaign. Fund one system on a commercial gymnasium pool system to monitor and prove the financial model to a National gym outfitter and let their dealers have a new product line. To have a 2nd system ready to be sent to disaster relief areas. There seems to be no limit on what needs to be done.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you can't contribute monetarily, but spreading the word via FB / Pinterest and other social networks helps in many ways.  Think of every person or organization you can get the word to, as a social dollar toward the campaign. Encourage students to get organized and force their campus and future campus to use Low carbon systems and vehicles.  Indiegogo share tools can help!</p>
<p>My sincerest thanks to all the people who have helped get the Tac-Q prototype completed; Ben Beiler, Ed Reicin and the entire staff at MPC International for the office space, CAD computer, collapsible water tank, machine shop, shipping and all the coffee.  To ACA ,Aluminum Coil &amp; Anodizing, for the material and Nova Metals for the bending and re-bending and re-bending again.  To The Kelly Group of Indiana, and especially Archie Smith, who took the CAD drawing and made it reality through their CNC water jets and talented tradesmen.  A special thank you to the Researcher, who after reading 128, twenty page submittals, decided that my unsolicited offer was worth reading and a system worth buying.<br/><br/>“Success has many fathers, failure is an orphan” - unknown.  You are all fathers to this project and again my sincerest thanks for your contributions, time and talents.</p>

<p>As I enter my senior year of college, I'll be completing a capstone project which is the culmination of my studies at Cornell.  I have a great opportunity to volunteer in Madagascar this fall and help research lemurs and
reptile/amphibian species there. With your help, I can take
advantage of this unique educational opportunity and make a difference there
through a program called Azafady. </p><p><b>The Program </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/749378/files/20140728114744-azafady_logo.jpg?1406573264"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>“Azafady” is an all-purpose Malagasey word which
means “please” or “excuse me” or, more literally, “let it not be taboo to me”.
It is essentially an expression of respect and I’m told that it’s a term that
I, as a foreigner, can expect to use regularly in my interactions with the
Malagasey people. The organization, Azafady,  chose this word for their
name because it displays the holistic and respectful viewpoint that defines their charity.
They are dedicated to building and supporting communities, both human and
non-human, in the Anosy (south-east) region of Madagascar.</p>
<p>Azafady has a lot going on. They offer humanitarian
aid to struggling local human communities, building schools, latrines, and
other necessary structures; providing better education opportunities; helping
prevent and control malaria outbreaks; and much, much more. They also strive to
protect and support non-human communities that rely on the fragmented littoral
(coastal) forest in the Sainte Luce area. These plant and animal communities
are astonishingly rich and diverse but, unfortunately, incredibly threatened since
most of them (more than 85%) exist only in
Madagascar. If you’re interested in learning more about Azafady, or want to
volunteer yourself, check out their website at <a href=""http://www.madagascar.co.uk/about-azafady/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.madagascar.co.uk/about-azafady/index.htm</a></p><p>If you're interested in learning more about Madagascar, please keep reading!</p>
<p><b>The Project </b></p><p>I will be working with their Azafady Conservation
Programme to study Lemur and herpetological (reptile and amphibian)
populations. The programme’s goals are </p>
<p>·  To establish the
density and distribution of the diurnal and nocturnal lemurs and reptile and
amphibian populations in the Sainte Luce forest fragments.</p>
<p>·  To investigate the
influence of edge effects on lemur and reptile and amphibian density and
distribution in the Saint Luce forest fragments</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In addition to collecting data for Azafady, I will
be conducting my own research project studying lemur/ reptile and amphibian
habitat fragmentation and the consequences of edge effects and human
interaction. This project will serve as the Capstone project for my Bachelor’s
degree in Environmental Studies and Ecology. I’ll be keeping a diary recording
my involvement with Azafady and my personal observations in Madagascar, writing
a paper detailing my research, and presenting on my experience when I get back
to the U.S. (sometime in December). I’ll also write a blog based off my diary,
which you can easily get access to (check out my perks!) I'll spend time studying the wild-life of the region, but also talking to  locals to hear their point of view on, well, pretty much anything we can talk about. Hopefully they'll be able to share some of their wisdom </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">acquired</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> from years of living in and with the forest. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Although I plan on being actively involved in their lemur and herpetology research, Azafady  makes a point of placing their dedication to helping build strong local communities above individual volunteer preferences. It's a large part of what helps their charity make a difference in the region. That means that on a given day I could be out collecting data, helping replace threatened trees and plants, building much needed structures, teaching local kids about malaria prevention and sustainable environmental practices, or doing pretty much anything else I'm needed for. Regardless of what, specifically, I spend my time doing, I am sure of two things:  that I can help Azafady positively affect this struggling region and that I can form a strong capstone project based off my experience there.<br/></span></p>
<p>Please help me take advantage of this amazing
opportunity. This is precisely the kind of work I hope to make my career in and
brings into play everything I’ve spent the last three years learning. It really
is the perfect culmination of my studies at Cornell and will provide me with
real-world experience (not to mention an incredibly unique capstone project) as
I prepare to look for a job that will allow me to do what I love. I’ve spent my
life in wonder of nature’s fascinating creatures and their beautifully
intricate and complex interactions; I am passionate about helping preserve the
natural diversity that makes our world so awe-inspiring. I’m also focused on
finding ways for humans to co-exist positively within their eco-systems without
having to face a choice between their own survival and survival of the
wild-life around them (as many in Africa and other developing countries do).
We, as Americans, rarely have to make that choice, so please help out so
that others don’t either!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Primary Costs: </b></p>
<p>Azafady requires a minimum donation of <span>£1,150 for the four weeks that
I’ll be there (that’s $1,971.00 US dollars)</span></p>
<p>Air Travel cost: estimated $2,000</p>
<p>Travel insurance and vaccination/medical costs (with the
danger of malaria and other scary diseases widespread and Africa currently experiencing
its largest Ebola outbreak ever, I can’t take too many precautions regarding
health) : estimated $1,000</p><p>Total cost: $5,000</p>
<p>As you can see, my actual costs are quite a bit more than
what I’m asking for here. I’m hoping that my college will be able to provide
some funding and I’m spending the summer working as a roofer to try and pay as
much as I can myself. It’s hard (and hot) work, but it’ll be worth it if I can
make my way to Madagascar. However, I won’t be able to raise as much as I need on
my own, so I need your help, especially since much of this (especially plane
tickets) needs to be paid for well in advance of my departure. Remember that
your donation is going towards a registered charity, committed to humanitarian
work and vital conservation and research efforts, either directly, as part of
the required donation, or by helping me get to Madagascar to help them out! If I don't reach my goal and the money raised is not enough to send me to Madagascar, I will donate the entire sum to Azafady.</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p><p>The work done by the Azafady Conservation Programme is increasingly important as Azafady has recently expanded their areas of research to include two forest fragments that lay in the Rio Tinto/ QMM mining path and are ear-marked for ilmenite (titanium ore) mining. This mining is expected to remove two thirds of the remaining forest (which is already suffering from logging and agricultural disturbance), drastically affecting the rare species living there. Several types of geckos and snakes have never been seen anywhere but in these threatened areas!  Azafady’s research will help us better understand the largely unknown habits and ecologic niches of the lemurs, reptiles and amphibians in the area so that they can be effectively trans-located to more secure forest homes. It is likely that many of the herpetological (reptile and amphibian) species are specialists on particular plants, meaning they can only live on one certain type of plant! That’s extremely important information for properly managing the trans-location of the species. For example; moving a lot of threatened geckos to an area that doesn’t have any of their favorite spiky <i>pandanus </i>plants won’t do any good at all because they won’t have anywhere to live!<br/></p><p><b>About Madagascar                    </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/749407/files/20140728121338-madagascar.gif?1406574818"" src="""" style=""width: 396px; height: 297px;""/></p><p>I'll be working out of Tolagnaro (formerly known as Fort Dauphin) which you can see at the bottom of the map.</p><p style=""display: inline !important;"">Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and can be found right off Africa's south-east coast. It is a particularly amazing place because it has one of the highest rates of endemic wild-life in the world (meaning they exist only in Madagascar!) with 80% of the vegetation and 90% of the animal life endemic to the island! Madagascar is the only place you can see a lemur in the wild - and you might see any one of over 100 species and sub-species. Madagascar is also home to two thirds of the world's chameleon species (including the worlds smallest chameleon, about the size of a Bumble Bee), a unique, cat-like predator called the fossa (pronounced ""foosha""), and myriad plant species including palms, boabs, orchids and the Madagascar periwinkle, which has been used to treat leukemia and Hodgkin's Disease, as well as other cancers. Unfortunately, all these incredible plants and animals are seriously threatened. 90% of the island's original forest has vanished and dozens of animal species have dissappeared, including the ten foot tall elephant bird and several of the larger lemur species (one of which was as big as a gorilla!) More will surely follow. </p><p>The native Malagasey people are also struggling. Madagascar is the 11th poorest nation in the word with 69% of the population living below the poverty line of one dollar per day. Many work in the agricultural sector on vanilla, cloves, or ylang-ylang plantations which are often operated un-sustainably by foreign corporations and continue to encroach on what remains of the country's natural forest. Mining for metal ores and oil also continue to contribute to habitat destruction and degradation. Azafady's holistic approach focuses on Malagasey communities, as well as the environment they live in, and works to help them live sustainably. When people are forced to make the decision to help preserve endangered plants and animals or simply survive, survival will always take first priority. Azafady aims to alleviate stresses on local communities so that they can help preserve their beautiful and rare surroundings without having to struggle for their daily existence. They offer a variety of humanitarian aid, and focus on providing education while also striving to learn from the Malagasey, as I hope to do. However well educated, no ecologist has as deep a connection to and understanding of the land as someone who has grown up in and lived from the forest.</p><p>A quick lemur fact: since lemur's pelvic bones are developed for life in the trees (and not bipedal ground motion) they have a unique way of moving on the ground...</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FCOWwHBlxG6M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCOWwHBlxG6M&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCOWwHBlxG6M%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Its pretty hilarious and sort of adorable too</p><p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p><p>This project is going to take a lot of work, but its something I'm super excited to be working for. </p><p>Here are some of the many risks and challenges I'll face:</p><ul>

I’m Elijah SchumacherI'm from Vermont and I'm a pretty lucky guy.I've been blessed with a great family,An amazing girlfriend,And the opportunity to pursue a bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies (focused on Ecology and Biology) at Cornell College in Iowa.(with some pretty great people, I might add)This fall I'd like to give back by helping out some people and animals who are a bit less fortunate than myself, while working to complete my degree at the same time! 
As I enter my senior year of college, I'll be completing a capstone project which is the culmination of my studies at Cornell.  I have a great opportunity to volunteer in Madagascar this fall and help research lemurs and
reptile/amphibian species there. With your help, I can take
advantage of this unique educational opportunity and make a difference there
through a program called Azafady. The Program 
“Azafady” is an all-purpose Malagasey word which
means “please” or “excuse me” or, more literally, “let it not be taboo to me”.
It is essentially an expression of respect and I’m told that it’s a term that
I, as a foreigner, can expect to use regularly in my interactions with the
Malagasey people. The organization, Azafady,  chose this word for their
name because it displays the holistic and respectful viewpoint that defines their charity.
They are dedicated to building and supporting communities, both human and
non-human, in the Anosy (south-east) region of Madagascar.
Azafady has a lot going on. They offer humanitarian
aid to struggling local human communities, building schools, latrines, and
other necessary structures; providing better education opportunities; helping
prevent and control malaria outbreaks; and much, much more. They also strive to
protect and support non-human communities that rely on the fragmented littoral
(coastal) forest in the Sainte Luce area. These plant and animal communities
are astonishingly rich and diverse but, unfortunately, incredibly threatened since
most of them (more than 85%) exist only in
Madagascar. If you’re interested in learning more about Azafady, or want to
volunteer yourself, check out their website at http://www.madagascar.co.uk/about-azafady/index.htmIf you're interested in learning more about Madagascar, please keep reading!
The Project I will be working with their Azafady Conservation
Programme to study Lemur and herpetological (reptile and amphibian)
populations. The programme’s goals are 
·  To establish the
density and distribution of the diurnal and nocturnal lemurs and reptile and
amphibian populations in the Sainte Luce forest fragments.
·  To investigate the
influence of edge effects on lemur and reptile and amphibian density and
distribution in the Saint Luce forest fragmentsIn addition to collecting data for Azafady, I will
be conducting my own research project studying lemur/ reptile and amphibian
habitat fragmentation and the consequences of edge effects and human
interaction. This project will serve as the Capstone project for my Bachelor’s
degree in Environmental Studies and Ecology. I’ll be keeping a diary recording
my involvement with Azafady and my personal observations in Madagascar, writing
a paper detailing my research, and presenting on my experience when I get back
to the U.S. (sometime in December). I’ll also write a blog based off my diary,
which you can easily get access to (check out my perks!) I'll spend time studying the wild-life of the region, but also talking to  locals to hear their point of view on, well, pretty much anything we can talk about. Hopefully they'll be able to share some of their wisdom acquired from years of living in and with the forest. Although I plan on being actively involved in their lemur and herpetology research, Azafady  makes a point of placing their dedication to helping build strong local communities above individual volunteer preferences. It's a large part of what helps their charity make a difference in the region. That means that on a given day I could be out collecting data, helping replace threatened trees and plants, building much needed structures, teaching local kids about malaria prevention and sustainable environmental practices, or doing pretty much anything else I'm needed for. Regardless of what, specifically, I spend my time doing, I am sure of two things:  that I can help Azafady positively affect this struggling region and that I can form a strong capstone project based off my experience there.
Please help me take advantage of this amazing
opportunity. This is precisely the kind of work I hope to make my career in and
brings into play everything I’ve spent the last three years learning. It really
is the perfect culmination of my studies at Cornell and will provide me with
real-world experience (not to mention an incredibly unique capstone project) as
I prepare to look for a job that will allow me to do what I love. I’ve spent my
life in wonder of nature’s fascinating creatures and their beautifully
intricate and complex interactions; I am passionate about helping preserve the
natural diversity that makes our world so awe-inspiring. I’m also focused on
finding ways for humans to co-exist positively within their eco-systems without
having to face a choice between their own survival and survival of the
wild-life around them (as many in Africa and other developing countries do).
We, as Americans, rarely have to make that choice, so please help out so
that others don’t either!Primary Costs: 
Azafady requires a minimum donation of £1,150 for the four weeks that
I’ll be there (that’s $1,971.00 US dollars)
Air Travel cost: estimated $2,000
Travel insurance and vaccination/medical costs (with the
danger of malaria and other scary diseases widespread and Africa currently experiencing
its largest Ebola outbreak ever, I can’t take too many precautions regarding
health) : estimated $1,000Total cost: $5,000
As you can see, my actual costs are quite a bit more than
what I’m asking for here. I’m hoping that my college will be able to provide
some funding and I’m spending the summer working as a roofer to try and pay as
much as I can myself. It’s hard (and hot) work, but it’ll be worth it if I can
make my way to Madagascar. However, I won’t be able to raise as much as I need on
my own, so I need your help, especially since much of this (especially plane
tickets) needs to be paid for well in advance of my departure. Remember that
your donation is going towards a registered charity, committed to humanitarian
work and vital conservation and research efforts, either directly, as part of
the required donation, or by helping me get to Madagascar to help them out! If I don't reach my goal and the money raised is not enough to send me to Madagascar, I will donate the entire sum to Azafady.The ImpactThe work done by the Azafady Conservation Programme is increasingly important as Azafady has recently expanded their areas of research to include two forest fragments that lay in the Rio Tinto/ QMM mining path and are ear-marked for ilmenite (titanium ore) mining. This mining is expected to remove two thirds of the remaining forest (which is already suffering from logging and agricultural disturbance), drastically affecting the rare species living there. Several types of geckos and snakes have never been seen anywhere but in these threatened areas!  Azafady’s research will help us better understand the largely unknown habits and ecologic niches of the lemurs, reptiles and amphibians in the area so that they can be effectively trans-located to more secure forest homes. It is likely that many of the herpetological (reptile and amphibian) species are specialists on particular plants, meaning they can only live on one certain type of plant! That’s extremely important information for properly managing the trans-location of the species. For example; moving a lot of threatened geckos to an area that doesn’t have any of their favorite spiky pandanus plants won’t do any good at all because they won’t have anywhere to live!About Madagascar                    I'll be working out of Tolagnaro (formerly known as Fort Dauphin) which you can see at the bottom of the map.Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and can be found right off Africa's south-east coast. It is a particularly amazing place because it has one of the highest rates of endemic wild-life in the world (meaning they exist only in Madagascar!) with 80% of the vegetation and 90% of the animal life endemic to the island! Madagascar is the only place you can see a lemur in the wild - and you might see any one of over 100 species and sub-species. Madagascar is also home to two thirds of the world's chameleon species (including the worlds smallest chameleon, about the size of a Bumble Bee), a unique, cat-like predator called the fossa (pronounced ""foosha""), and myriad plant species including palms, boabs, orchids and the Madagascar periwinkle, which has been used to treat leukemia and Hodgkin's Disease, as well as other cancers. Unfortunately, all these incredible plants and animals are seriously threatened. 90% of the island's original forest has vanished and dozens of animal species have dissappeared, including the ten foot tall elephant bird and several of the larger lemur species (one of which was as big as a gorilla!) More will surely follow. The native Malagasey people are also struggling. Madagascar is the 11th poorest nation in the word with 69% of the population living below the poverty line of one dollar per day. Many work in the agricultural sector on vanilla, cloves, or ylang-ylang plantations which are often operated un-sustainably by foreign corporations and continue to encroach on what remains of the country's natural forest. Mining for metal ores and oil also continue to contribute to habitat destruction and degradation. Azafady's holistic approach focuses on Malagasey communities, as well as the environment they live in, and works to help them live sustainably. When people are forced to make the decision to help preserve endangered plants and animals or simply survive, survival will always take first priority. Azafady aims to alleviate stresses on local communities so that they can help preserve their beautiful and rare surroundings without having to struggle for their daily existence. They offer a variety of humanitarian aid, and focus on providing education while also striving to learn from the Malagasey, as I hope to do. However well educated, no ecologist has as deep a connection to and understanding of the land as someone who has grown up in and lived from the forest.A quick lemur fact: since lemur's pelvic bones are developed for life in the trees (and not bipedal ground motion) they have a unique way of moving on the ground...Its pretty hilarious and sort of adorable tooRisks and ChallengesThis project is going to take a lot of work, but its something I'm super excited to be working for. Here are some of the many risks and challenges I'll face:
I'll need to learn as much Malagasey (the native language) as I possibly can
I'll have to learn to communicate with people without a common language.
Not only have I never been out of the USA, I jumped out of the only airplane I've ever set foot in. It was awesome, but now I have to learn to navigate airports.
I may (worst case scenario) get malaria, need emergency medical care, and get expatriated.
I may get bitten by a lemur! Yikes!
I have to submit (and get approved)  my project proposal to my capstone team, comprised of trusted professors and mentors at Cornell College.

year ago I had the opportunity to travel to a Tibetan community
located in a far eastern part of India.  My uncle Rodney had
befriended a Tibetan monk, Lama Tashi Bapu, and promised him he would
help him help his people. I was more or less tagging along for an
epic adventure in the Himalayas. I knew that uncle Rodney was
planning on helping Tashi build a water filtration system for a
school and university that Tashi ran, but I really didn't know what I
was getting myself into. Fortunately I had my sister by my side. </font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal;""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font>After
a long journey we arrived at the Tibetan Cultural Institute to the
dreadful news that of the 190 students, about 20 had reported cases
of Typhoid.  Others were sick and had not seen a doctor and a
handful of others still had confirmed cases of hepatitis A. Both
diseases are fatal if untreated. </font></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal;""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font>All
this was due to contaminated drinking water. Generally human or
animal feces would get washed into streams during heavy downpours and
without any real filtration would end up in the drinking water. The
nearest public hospital is a few days journey away. Fortunately, in
this case, the military hospital and road workers hospital nearby saw
and treated the sick students, but full medical testing for the
variety of ailments related to the consumption of contaminated water

Story
Dear
Friends, 

A
year ago I had the opportunity to travel to a Tibetan community
located in a far eastern part of India.  My uncle Rodney had
befriended a Tibetan monk, Lama Tashi Bapu, and promised him he would
help him help his people. I was more or less tagging along for an
epic adventure in the Himalayas. I knew that uncle Rodney was
planning on helping Tashi build a water filtration system for a
school and university that Tashi ran, but I really didn't know what I
was getting myself into. Fortunately I had my sister by my side. 
After
a long journey we arrived at the Tibetan Cultural Institute to the
dreadful news that of the 190 students, about 20 had reported cases
of Typhoid.  Others were sick and had not seen a doctor and a
handful of others still had confirmed cases of hepatitis A. Both
diseases are fatal if untreated. 

All
this was due to contaminated drinking water. Generally human or
animal feces would get washed into streams during heavy downpours and
without any real filtration would end up in the drinking water. The
nearest public hospital is a few days journey away. Fortunately, in
this case, the military hospital and road workers hospital nearby saw
and treated the sick students, but full medical testing for the
variety of ailments related to the consumption of contaminated water
was prohibitively expensive and went undiagnosed.
 
The
students at this school are not the only ones drinking contaminated
water. There are countless villages in the region that rely on the
same supply. The lack of accessible medical facilities compounds
the problem, in many cases turning avoidable maladies into fatal
illnesses.

It
is our plan to return to this beautiful and remote part of the world
and provide the inhabitants with the tools and the education to
improve their quality of life. With your help, we can help these people take immediate
steps toward longer and healthier lives.

Thank you for your support! 

-Yasmine



The
Impact
Improve
the lives of the inhabitants of rural Tibetan India, saving the lives
of countless people in the process. 

The
Plan 
A
two-pronged approach:
1.
Provide families with small point of use water filtration kits that
will last several years and only cost about $40 each.
2.
With the help of Lama Tashi and his students we will provide basic
sanitation and healthcare education to ensure that everyone
understands how and why to use the filters. 

The
Goal 
Our
goal is use the funds from this campaign to purchase 150 filters (or
more!). All funds will be used directly on the filters. Travel and
shipping costs will be covered separately. 

**All
donations are 100% tax deductible and will go through Rodney's
nonprofit, International
Voices for Care, a
registered 501(c)(3)
non-profit charity.**

<p><b>Singing
the Oceans Alive</b><i> is a benefit concert, at Fairfield Halls, (Croydon),
London on 25
April 2014. It is designed as a dynamic collaboration of artists from around

whales and dolphins of our oceans, to be played along with the world-renowned Royal
Philharmonic Concert Orchestra. </i></p>
<p><b>What
is the concert about?</b></p>
<p>Music is a universal language made up from various frequencies, and we know that cetaceans also communicate using frequencies: some we can hear, but others we cannot.

marine biologist and scientists are actively pursuing research that involves
breaking the language code that they believe is being communicated from whales
and dolphins alike. It is believed their music is not merely about mating
rituals, or for hunting and other physical activities but, rather, that it
represents a complex, universal language of its own.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Cetaceans in peril!</b></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With recent
reports of yet more military sonar experimentation in the oceans being carried

also die.</span><br/></p>

overall. That’s an average of one detonation every two minutes for the next
five years, with many of them in and around sensitive whale habitat where cetaceans
mate and feed.</p>
<p>We
don't know exactly how many marine mammals will die from this activity, but the projected take of marine mammals is anywhere from 11- 33 million…this is almost incomprehensible, and most definitely not acceptable. The damage to communities of cetaceans is a major issue, and one

<p><b>Singing the
Oceans Alive to put you in the picture!</b></p>
<p>What we aim
to deliver on April 25, 2014 is a greater understanding of how, like the whale
and dolphin song that we seek to understand, our music is also a universal
language that transcends cultures, races and borders. It is an evening of
tribute to the music of the entire planet, and an awakening to the majesty of
these incredible sea beings.</p>
<p><b>We need your
help please!</b></p>
<p>The costs of creating such
an event successfully are intensive, and we need help from the community to do
this right to get the message out to the world through the mainstream media.
Meeting our goal will pay for an adequate public relations effort, transportation
for artists, accommodation, technical staff and equipment. We hope to be able
to raise enough funding to be able to stream this event worldwide.<br/><br/><b>
We need your help!</b> We have rallied people from many other organisations, and
now we are calling out for your support, asking you to be part of this noble
effort to reach out to the global community, and help people recognise the
vital importance the cetaceans play on our planet, weaving the music of the
oceans while they struggle to survive, as many are on the endangered species
list.<br/><br/>
If you care about whales and dolphins, and want to do something positive to
help raise global awareness and a deeper understanding of their importance—to
adults and children around the world—please help us fund this worthy project by
donating what you can.<br/><br/>
This is a strictly non-profit event. Any proceeds will go to Save Earth's
Oceans, Inc., to fund campaigns we will undertake for the protection of the
oceans, with a specific focus on helping the cetaceans strive and live as free,
sovereign beings.<br/><br/><b>

and dolphin song that we seek to understand, our music is also a universal
language that transcends cultures, races and borders. It is an evening of
tribute to the music of the entire planet, and an awakening to the majesty of
these incredible sea beings.
We need your
help please!
The costs of creating such
an event successfully are intensive, and we need help from the community to do
this right to get the message out to the world through the mainstream media.
Meeting our goal will pay for an adequate public relations effort, transportation
for artists, accommodation, technical staff and equipment. We hope to be able
to raise enough funding to be able to stream this event worldwide.
We need your help! We have rallied people from many other organisations, and
now we are calling out for your support, asking you to be part of this noble
effort to reach out to the global community, and help people recognise the
vital importance the cetaceans play on our planet, weaving the music of the
oceans while they struggle to survive, as many are on the endangered species
list.
If you care about whales and dolphins, and want to do something positive to
help raise global awareness and a deeper understanding of their importance—to
adults and children around the world—please help us fund this worthy project by
donating what you can.
This is a strictly non-profit event. Any proceeds will go to Save Earth's
Oceans, Inc., to fund campaigns we will undertake for the protection of the
oceans, with a specific focus on helping the cetaceans strive and live as free,
sovereign beings.
For the whales and dolphins, and all the ocean beings, we thank you for
everything you do to help protect our oceans, and keep the music alive.And lastly, don't forget, if
you are contributing from the U.S.,
because Save Earth's Oceans Inc,. are officially recognised as a non-profit
with full status from the IRS, your donation can be deducted from your U.S. taxes!

About Patricia CoriLast year, Patricia co-founded the global non-profit organisation, SAVE EARTH’S OCEANS, INC., which is dedicated to help clean up the beaches and oceans of our planet worldwide, to awaken people to the importance of protecting the sea mammals, and to help restore the balance of our fragile ecosystems of the oceans. As President and CEO of the organisation, she is determined to raise the consciousness of human beings around the globe to the potential of the human spirit to alter the course of our destruction of the environment and to re-establish the harmony of Earth in balance.
Patricia Cori is a tireless
campaigner and active supporter of many initiatives around raising awareness of
the plight of cetaceans and Earth’s fragile eco-system. Through her own radio
shows, public speaking and published books, she is helping awaken people to the
peril facing whales and dolphins, and all marine life. She is an advocate for
solution-based initiatives, having not only undertaken her own research first
hand on several whale expeditions and swimming with wild dolphins, she also
actively assists in helping fundraise for like-minded organisations’ campaigns.
Using her powerful position as a best-selling author with the media, and her
global readership, she is able to drive home the urgency – not only to the already
involved and aware people around the globe, but also to the greater public.Her
latest book, THE EMISSARY, (published by North Atlantic Books/Random House
distribution), is to be released in the U.K. March 24th 2014. Her first
novel, she cleverly weaves the message of whale and dolphin conversation and
this very question of their communications into the enthralling story, which is
already receiving accolades from key voices in media. The film and TV rights
have already been acquired by Global Universal Pictures in Hollywood, to be developed into a major
motion picture. Her message and her passion for the work she has embarked upon
are definitely reaching the mainstream.

Patricia has recently launched a campaign against the sonar testing by the military. To support this petition, please visit: http://www.thepetitionsite.com/400/292/287/stop-navy-sonar-impact-on-the-whales-and-dolphins-plain-and-simple/",5.0,3,"7 Campaigns

Best thing about our approach is the fact that kids influence their families and chage the way their parents think about waste disposal.Association of Citizens ""Neighbor"" has been around for 10 years and we put most of our efforts in the education of children and adults about the problem of pollution of nature. Educating children in schools affects the awareness of senior citizens, because their children and grandchildren often call for attention to this problem. Serbia recycles only 6-7%, while the European average of about 60-70%, which explains how necessary it is to intensify efforts in this field.The aim of our project is education and installing sets of special containers in schools, so that the children acquire the habit of collecting waste and its separation and learn about problems and possible solutions. We use our good relations with local media to promote our project and inform citizens about necessity of recycling. Amongst all, we have active phone number which our citizens can use to contact us if they have all sorts of electronic waste they want to get rid off.

To get to a point where we can earn enough to cover our expenses and invest in further development we need at least 25 more sets of containers.
Containers we installed in one of schoolsCovering 30 out of 50 schools in our area would give big boost to our efforts since we could cover our expenses and speed up our progression. Education of school kids is important and its good way to prevent further pollution which will lead to cleaner environment. Using reward system, where schools get something in return for collected

 This is how their goals looked before our intervention!!!Kids responded to our call for action at very large amount and collected well over 500kg of electronic waste and about 200kg of paper and plastic.Schools respond in great manner to our project, but without financial support it is impossible to increase our efforts. Due to quite poor financial situation in our country, most companies don't want or can't  invest funds in our project. That is why we ask, all of you good people at this site to help us in this good cause.To give you just a slight hint of the problems we face in Serbia watch this movie:This is the movie about biggest river in south Serbia and this river is just one of many polluted rivers. Pollution
 of this magnitude affects not only the citizens of Serbia, but also to 
all the countries in the region, and indirectly to the rest of the world
 since the water from the river into the Danube, and on its way to the 
black sea.


By placing a large number of these recycling containers would 
create the foundation for a constantly increasing number of schools 
involved in our activities, and thus would increase the number of 
citizens who would be informed about the problems. This way we would, in a very short time, raise the percentage of recycling in our city, as well as in Serbia. With the growth of our project we would impact on the consciousness of the rest of Serbia which would lead us to our ultimate goal: a cleaner and nicer Serbia and cleaner and nicer Earth.
  What We Need 
We need necessary funds for production of sets of containers that will be placed in elementary and high schools. Making each set of containers costs 500 USD (4 containers - paper, plastic, aluminum cans, small electronic devices). These containers would be placed in schools of Novi Sad and the more important places in our city. For the profitability of our project need to put at least 25 sets of containers.
One part of the money will be used to organize Recycling days in the surrounding villages and smaller towns, specific actions to clean illegal dump sites, particularly the vulnerable localities, as well as raising awareness of the Serbian population about the problems we face.  Even if we don't manage to collect desired funding, it's a start. Money would still be invested production of containers and everything over this amount will be used in organisation of Recycling days, cleaning illegal dump sites and activities needed to clean polluted rivers.
 
  The Impact As mentioned earlier, our campaign would initialy rise percentage of recycling in our country, which would indirectly affect the pollution reduction at the global level.
More waste recycled would mean cleaner rivers, which would again reduce pollution of Danube (2nd biggest river in Europe), Black sea and indirectly Mediterranean sea and Atlantic ocean.
We are witnessing a growing climate change at the global level, and any contribution is very important. Success of our mission would hopefully be copied in other countries which would produce chain reaction that leads to a cleaner planet.Association of Citizens ""Neighbor"" actively contributes to the preservation of nature for many years and is very well-known locally. Awarded by the Provincial authorities for their contribution in nature preservation.

To go carbon neutral with a workshop powered by solar avoiding the environmental impact of running machinery off electrics.
To expand and create new workshops around Malawi.

Hi everyone, my name is Guilherme. I'm from Brazil.I'm doing a project called World Coast Journey for the Preservation of the Seas. The idea of the project is to make the entire coast of the World by bike and sailboat to speak to as many people I can to aware them about the problem of the garbage, trash and mainly about the plastic problem in the beaches and in the Oceans.


Did you know that every year 1 million see birds and 100 mille marine mammals die because of debris?

      





Did you know that we have islands of plastic in the middle of the Ocean? The biggest one is in the north of Pacific Ocean, the size is compared with the state of Texas in the USA.



       




Did you know that the turttles eat the plastic bag thinking they are medusa?And than died because that.


                 

Did you know that the plastic in the ocean become microplastic that the fishes eat and than we eat the fishes stay bad and don't know why?

Let's do something to solve these problems.Help me to continue this journey trying to concius as many people I can around the world.


World Coast Journey 
The project will aware the people around the World cycling and sailing the World Coast for the Preservation of the Seas. The journey is split in 8 parts around the globe.



Mediterranean Sea = 15.000 km and 10 countries
Europe = 15.500 km and 14 countries
South America = 25.500 km and 8 countries
Central America=12.000 km and 13 countries
Australia (still under construction)
Africa (still under construction)
Asia (still under construction)
North America (still under construction)

With Europe, Mediterranean, South and Central America the journey already have almost 70.000 km crossing 52 countries.
By now I'm doing the Mediterranean Coast, I already cycled more than 10 thousand kilometers in 5 months, speaking with more than 1.700 people about the project and these problems. During this time I cycled around the coast of Italy including Sardinia and Sicily, also Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece and now I'm going to Turkey. The idea was to make Siria, Libano, Israel following the North Africa doing the entire round of the Mediterranean Sea. But by now is not the moment to make it. It's dangerous and I decide to change this part going to Istanbul and make the coast of Turkey taking a boat back to Genova - Italy finishing this part of the journey in the Strait of Gibraltar crossing the coast of France and Spain completing 10 countries and approximatelly 15 thousand kilometers. When I complete this part I'm going to Gran Canarie to work in a sailboat to learn how to sail crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Santa Lucia - Venezuela. Then I will stop for a while to make a documentary of the Mediterranean Coast and maybe write a book.


Also I will take the time to prepare and decide the next part of the project that will be South or Central America.

</h3> <p>In March 2016, over 100 young business and community leaders from around the world will travel to Antarctica for two weeks as part of an <b>annual expedition held by the 2041 Foundation and polar explorer Robert Swan</b>. Expedition members will see first hand the impacts of climate change and human activity on the remote and
surprisingly fragile Antarctic continent. <br/></p>
<p>Expedition members commit to 
making their companies and communities more sustainable 
and resilient with initiatives ranging from increasing 
access to public transit in a hometown in India to helping 
Californians get by with less water. <b>Only 
by building resilient, sustainable communities will we be able to 
protect the Antarctic wilderness and our quality of life at home</b>.</p>
<p> <b>With your help, our team of four colleagues from management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company can join the expedition.</b> Our normal days are spent helping clients solve their most challenging business problems by creating lasting change. For those two weeks, we will turn our full attention towards coaching the expedition members on how to translate their bold environmental and social ambitions into actionable, achievable plans with meaningful results. This type of <b>coaching for corporate clients would typically cost many times more than the expedition fees </b>needed to send our team on this expedition.<br/></p>
<p><b>Our coaching and ongoing support will ensure that the expedition members are successful in the projects they pursue after returning home. We hope this will lead them to a lifetime of environmental advocacy and civic engagement. </b>Your contribution will make this global impact possible.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Inspiration in Antarctica for Change at Home
 In March 2016, over 100 young business and community leaders from around the world will travel to Antarctica for two weeks as part of an annual expedition held by the 2041 Foundation and polar explorer Robert Swan. Expedition members will see first hand the impacts of climate change and human activity on the remote and
surprisingly fragile Antarctic continent. 
Expedition members commit to 
making their companies and communities more sustainable 
and resilient with initiatives ranging from increasing 
access to public transit in a hometown in India to helping 
Californians get by with less water. Only 
by building resilient, sustainable communities will we be able to 
protect the Antarctic wilderness and our quality of life at home.
 With your help, our team of four colleagues from management consulting firm Bain & Company can join the expedition. Our normal days are spent helping clients solve their most challenging business problems by creating lasting change. For those two weeks, we will turn our full attention towards coaching the expedition members on how to translate their bold environmental and social ambitions into actionable, achievable plans with meaningful results. This type of coaching for corporate clients would typically cost many times more than the expedition fees needed to send our team on this expedition.
Our coaching and ongoing support will ensure that the expedition members are successful in the projects they pursue after returning home. We hope this will lead them to a lifetime of environmental advocacy and civic engagement. Your contribution will make this global impact possible.
Our team consists of four consultants from across North America. While we all work for the same company, we are making a personal commitment to this endeavor and are not sponsored by Bain.

Eitan Rovero, Mexico City, consultant to governments and retail companies; electronic engineer; passionate about photographing and sharing the wonders of our planet


Nikki Yurkoski, Dallas, consultant to technology and retail companies; former neuroscience student and researcher; passionate about traveling


Ann Alampi, Houston, consultant in the energy sector and for an international education non-profit; former geology researcher/student; committed to improving science education
 
Andrew Olesen, Washington DC, consultant to industrial and technology companies;
former Navy nuclear engineer; passionate about wilderness 
    What We Need & What You Get 
Expedition fees start at $11,000 each plus additional travel expenses. 


We need your contribution to get us on the expedition. Your contribution will enhance the team's substantial personal investment of time and money.
 Sponsors will be regularly updated on our progress and may be eligible for some exclusive perks.

After the expedition, we will remain in touch with other members and report back on the results achieved and our role in them.    The Impact Your donation today will help over 100 young leaders create valuable change in their communities worldwide for decades to come. This expedition is a chance for these young leaders to commit to their ideas and make them real, with our team there to provide coaching and support. 
Our team will be investing heavily in training and preparation with some of the world's leading experts on business coaching and change management. We have a track record of meaningful impact, both individually and as evidenced by the results of Bain & Company colleagues on prior expeditions.

<p><b>Education is the key to reducing marine plastic pollution. <br/></b></p>
<p>80% of plastic pollution comes from land based sources and in the US its the trash that ""falls through the cracks"". Its the plastic bag on the side walk that blows into a storm drain or the plastic bottle you put in the overflowing trashcan on the beach or the balloon you let float away. Educating children and adults is one of the key ways to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is produced and the amount that could make its way into our oceans. In my position as a whale watch educator I educate over 20,000 people every season about the oceans and its threats. If just 10% of that number stopped using plastic grocery bags just one week a year it would make a huge difference. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Team Introductions: </strong></p>
<p><strong>SIX CORE EXPEDITION TEAM MEMBERS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mike Markovina:</strong> Mike has a Masters degree in Ichthyology and Fisheries Science. After working on leatherback turtle conservation and fisheries management projects for the Mayumba Marine Park in southern Gabon for the Wildlife Conservation Society, he and Linda began a two-year expedition using photography and film to illuminate the positive uses of marine resources they found across Africa, Asia and Europe (42 countries in 24 months). Passionate about the oceans, Mike currently works extensively in East Africa on illegal fisheries (Monitoring, Control and Surveillance), from the shores of Lake Victoria to the dynamited reefs of Tanzania. With years of diving experience the world over, and driven by a deep passion for the marine environment, Mike aims to live a life of respect, appreciation and continued exploration, sharing with the world ideas, innovation new technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Beswick: </strong>A high impact entrepreneur with a BSc in Biotechnology and honours in Financial Analysis &amp; Portfolio Management.His primary passion is where the leverage points in a system can be found, so that he can intervene to bring about the greatest positive change. He also has an undying passion for entrepreneurship and enabling others – with the greater goal of facilitating the development of entrepreneurship, through culture and mindset changes. In this regard, Justin has successfully launched organizations/companies that demonstrate and facilitate these efforts and has been selected as a Brightest Young Mind and World Economic Forum Global Shaper.</p>
<p><strong>Rhett Bennett:</strong> Having grown up at the coast, spending his childhood fishing, snorkelling, SCUBA diving and surfing, Rhett developed a passion for fish and the marine environment, which eventually led to a PhD in Ichthyology and Fisheries Science. Rhett has worked in a number of areas, including fishing hotspots, marine protected areas (MPAs) and estuaries, along South Africa’s coastline, focussing on fish movement patterns, the benefits <span> </span>of MPAs, the ecological effects of fishing on fish communities, as well as the design of long-term monitoring programmes for assessing reef fish communities. </p>
<p><strong>Tanith Grant: </strong>Tanith grew up in the land-locked wildlife-rich areas of Zimbabwe, and had to go far afield on adventurous family holidays (aka “selection course”) in <span> </span>order to visit the ocean. These holidays involved expeditions along the pristine Mozambican coastline, which left its vivid imprint of sights and smells and the ocean’s warm caress lingering for years to come. With these influences, Tanith was only interested in working towards environmental conservation and went on to complete a degree in Geography and Environmental Science. Not quite satisfied in that field, she continued with an MSc in Zoology, investigating leopard population and movement patterns in Zimbabwe. Tanith’s education, hobbies and <span> </span>passion are well integrated and have resulted in a well-rounded background in GIS, 4x4ing, telemetry, navigation, SCUBA diving, travel, fishing, conservation, photography and soon-to-be sailing!</p>
<p><strong>Linda Markovina: </strong>Linda is a passionate traveller and conservationist. She spent two years as the better-looking half of the Marine Resource Expedition, which travelled the globe filming and photographing people making a change in marine conservation. After successfully completing the expedition in 2010 she is now co-director of Moving Sushi along with Mike Markovina. Together, the two are dedicated to bringing about inspiration and change in marine and ocean conservation through science, film, photography and open-access information.  Linda is a freelance writer, environmental journalist and photographer who has been published in various magazines in South Africa and internationally, and currently blogs for <span><em>The Africa Report</em></span> and <span><em>Getaway </em></span><span><em>Magazine</em></span> on marine conservation issues as well as being a TIES ecotourism ambassador.  </p>
<p><strong>Caine Delacy: </strong>With a PhD in marine ecology, a dive master qualification and a healthy dose of adventure, Caine has been travelling the world working on coral and temperate reef ecosystems. He is interested in the patterns and processes influencing reef ecosystems at large scales – such as along entire continental margins. He is also interested in and has worked on many marine protected areas (MPAs) and considers these one of the key components for the future health of reef ecosystems. He has played a role in both the design and implementation of monitoring programs for MPAs across the world. Caine also recognises the importance of engaging the volunteer community to play an important role in science and conservation, and that volunteers can contribute to research surveying and data processing. When not underwater or taking photos, you will find Caine rock climbing, surfing, snowboarding or trying to get lost in the mountains</p>

<h3><strong>Spencer Tunick is returning to Israel. Please join him on September 14th at the Dead Sea. <a href=""http://www.nakedsea.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nakedsea.info</a>  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We are using Indiegogo as a platform for getting the word out internationally and for organizing the local production. You need to contribute something (as low as $1) to attend the event. Bus Transportation from Tel Aviv is $35</strong></h3>
<h3>It has been nearly 1 year since you helped Spencer Tunick achieve his historic art installation at the Dead Sea. Your participation resulted in many key accomplishments:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Spencer Tunick created some of his best work of art in Israel</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>The world media took notice and over 500 million people saw a new positive image of Israel and learnt about the environmental issues of the Dead Sea</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Spencer gave amazing quotes to the press reinforcing his love for Israel, the Israeli people, and the environment</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>We succeeded in elevating the Dead Sea to the Final 10 list in the New 7 Wonders of the World Competition</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>The religious parties in Kneset led by Shas and Bayit Heyehudi failed in their attempt to suppress Freedom of Speech in Israel and to block our art installation</h3>
</li>
</ul><h3>Unfortunately the battle is not yet over and the Dead Sea is still in danger. </h3>
<h3>It is for these reasons that Spencer Tunick has decided to return to Israel and to the Dead Sea. He is partnering with the grassroots organization ""Save Our Sea"" <a href=""http://www.saveoursea.org.il"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.saveoursea.org.il</a> who is focused on the unique medical/healing properties of the Dead Sea that people from all over the world depend on.  Each year they hold an annual Dead Sea Float to raise international awareness.  This year they have decided to hold their event around the same time of the 1 year anniversary of our installation. Spencer is coming to Israel for this event and we would like you to join him !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </h3>
<h3>Our proposed agenda is (which is still subject to change):</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Buses leave Tel Aviv around 12am on Friday morning to arrive at the Dead Sea by 3am</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>From 3-5am we'll gather on the beach for a jam session with accoustic music (bring your guitars and drums to join in).  </h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>From 5am – 6am we will have our opening ceremony along with enviromental activists who will share their opinions about the dead sea and its future </h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>From 6am – 7am Spencer Tunick will invite everyone into the water to float together</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>From 7am -9am \With Spencer's guidence, photographers will take pictures of the participants – both individually and collectively</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>10am – The buses will return to Tel Aviv and elsewhere</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Please note that this is not a nude event</strong></h3>

Spencer Tunick is returning to Israel. Please join him on September 14th at the Dead Sea. www.nakedsea.info  
We are using Indiegogo as a platform for getting the word out internationally and for organizing the local production. You need to contribute something (as low as $1) to attend the event. Bus Transportation from Tel Aviv is $35
It has been nearly 1 year since you helped Spencer Tunick achieve his historic art installation at the Dead Sea. Your participation resulted in many key accomplishments:


Spencer Tunick created some of his best work of art in Israel


The world media took notice and over 500 million people saw a new positive image of Israel and learnt about the environmental issues of the Dead Sea


Spencer gave amazing quotes to the press reinforcing his love for Israel, the Israeli people, and the environment


We succeeded in elevating the Dead Sea to the Final 10 list in the New 7 Wonders of the World Competition


The religious parties in Kneset led by Shas and Bayit Heyehudi failed in their attempt to suppress Freedom of Speech in Israel and to block our art installation

Unfortunately the battle is not yet over and the Dead Sea is still in danger. 
It is for these reasons that Spencer Tunick has decided to return to Israel and to the Dead Sea. He is partnering with the grassroots organization ""Save Our Sea"" www.saveoursea.org.il who is focused on the unique medical/healing properties of the Dead Sea that people from all over the world depend on.  Each year they hold an annual Dead Sea Float to raise international awareness.  This year they have decided to hold their event around the same time of the 1 year anniversary of our installation. Spencer is coming to Israel for this event and we would like you to join him !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Our proposed agenda is (which is still subject to change):


Buses leave Tel Aviv around 12am on Friday morning to arrive at the Dead Sea by 3am


From 3-5am we'll gather on the beach for a jam session with accoustic music (bring your guitars and drums to join in).  


From 5am – 6am we will have our opening ceremony along with enviromental activists who will share their opinions about the dead sea and its future 


From 6am – 7am Spencer Tunick will invite everyone into the water to float together


From 7am -9am \With Spencer's guidence, photographers will take pictures of the participants – both individually and collectively


10am – The buses will return to Tel Aviv and elsewhere


Please note that this is not a nude event

http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/08/spencer-tunick-naked-dead-sea/
Please help us by joining the float in body and/or spirit. We would like to bring thousands of people to the Dead Sea and need your active participation. Please help spread the word. This is not a nude event - we expect people to wear clothes - but clothing is optional. 
Sincerely,
Shlomit Yarkoni & Ari Fruchter: Naked Sea www.nakedsea.info

P.S. You can also take a look at our Kickstarter campaign from last year which raised $116K and helped fund the project. The work by Shlomit and me is voluntary and all funds raised are used to pay for direct costs associated with production.  Spencer Tunick is an invited guest to Israel and is not involved nor responsible for the production of this event.

<p><strong>PROJECT MISSION</strong></p>
<p>We want to make an album of the most soulful Christmas carols, sung entirely by whales.</p>
<p>Some of us love the winter holidays, but for many it has lost its magic and much of the sacredness, warmth and connection seem to have been replaced by commercial jingles and the frenzy of shopping.</p>
<p>Using our species’ fascination and affinity for whales, we are creating a unique and personal connection to the grace and wonder of the season. And perhaps even a new joy that we had not experienced before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p><em>Whale Christmas </em>is a completely original album of traditional Christmas songs that connects listeners to the deep spirituality of the holiday while encouraging a direct experience of the sacredness of nature.</p>
<p>A variety of natural whale voices will be used to create a new kind of holiday carol. These songs will be orchestrated to a tempo reflecting the natural speed and rhythm of whale sounds in the wild. Only songs of an inherent soulful nature (such as <em>Silent Night</em>) will be used for the project (<em>Jingle Bells </em>will <strong>not </strong>be included).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BENEFIT TO OCEANS</strong></p>
<p><em>Whale Christmas </em>is partnering with <em>BLUEMIND—</em>a non-profit project that works with scientists to research and foster our species’ innate love for—and significant benefit from—direct experience of oceans.</p>
<p>Our goal is to fund BlueMind's major initiatives in 2012-13, especially their annual oceanographer/neuroscientist conference and the world's first study on the benefit of whale song on the human brain.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We’re a team from Minnesota and Uganda on a mission to deliver sustainability.</p>
<p>In Uganda, ninety percent of people cook food using charcoal, creating an industry that fuels deforestation. Uganda relies on its lush forests for wildlife habitats, tourism, and critical ecosystem services, so this destruction is unsustainable. Innovators in Kampala have created a viable alternative fuel - briquettes made from organic waste rather than living plants -  but have failed to revolutionize the market.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506368919/ywimzo9ul5itf6lslitg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Kaloli Energy pairs home delivery of waste-based briquettes with the social value of trash collection, a service that 60% of Kampalans lack. For the same price as buying a week’s supply of charcoal at a marketplace, Kaloli’s employees deliver it right to a customer's door. In the same trip, we collect their trash for deposit in a local landfill rather than clogging sewers or being burnt in backyards!</p>
<p>If this business succeeds, it will clean the air and increase sustainability in a city of 1.9 million, while creating dozens or hundreds of jobs for locals.</p>
<p>We spent May to August 2017 in Kampala testing our assumptions, building local connections, and establishing a pilot version of the project. We've found subscribers and customers, and as we've gotten to know our customers, we've learned that we need to change the ways we deliver fuel to match local culture.</p>
<p><strong><u>That’s where you come in.</u></strong></p>
<p>The money we raise in this campaign will go towards paying salaries and buying supplies to keep Kaloli operating until we can hit our goal of 120 regular subscribers. With it, we’ll be able to run the business for three months longer, and buy tons more of sustainable charcoal (literally). Help us spark the growth of Kaloli and help with Kampalas journey down the path to a greener future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Kaloli has accomplished two months of market research and an additional two months of piloting our business with the $6000 we earned as grand-prize winners of the University of Minnesota's BizPitch and Acara Challenge startup competitions.</p>
<p>Now that we have supplies and premises, the money we earn in this campaign will keep us afloat through <strong>three additional months of business pivots and development</strong>. Your gift will extend the time we have to test the following core strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Adapting our subscription model.</strong> Subscription services don't match Kampalans' cultural norms, so we'll realign our business to sell single-serving bags of waste-based briquettes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Moving to a new neighborhood.</strong> We established our business in a lower-income neighborhood than our original target, so we will research whether a different region of the city might be more amenable to our model.</li>
<li>
<strong>Changing the way we market subscriptions.</strong> Subscriptions don't match Kampalans' expectations, but are a great way for customers to save money. Doing more market research will help us understand how best to approach this topic.</li>
<li>
<strong>Focus on briquette delivery.</strong> Market tests show that some people are content with their current trash management. While we will continue to offer waste collection, we hope to focus even more on how to improve our delivery and become more well known in the community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every dollar spent will go towards delivering your perk and developing Kaloli Energy - the co-founders will earn nothing from this campaign. Any gift you give helps us pay Lydia and Ivan, our employees in Kampala, buy waste-based briquettes, and keep our delivery motorcycle on the road. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506186382/y4nsujyqdffyadxzaccc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>For $5, we will give you a shout-out on our Facebook page, along with the chance to see the co-founders pied in the face! For every $100 raised under a co-founder’s name, they will be hit in the face with a whipped-cream pie! The co-founder with the largest total money donated will be pied in the face once for every $50 raised. We'll record a video and post it to the Kaloli <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KaloliEnergy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a>.<br/><strong>Stretch Goal! </strong>If these perks raise a combined $500, Kaloli will publicly host this event on the University of Minnesota campus!! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506374543/looq3091fisscjilwtju.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For $10, you can own a Kaloli-branded laptop sticker, printed by our friends at Print Magic in Kampala! Stickers are approximately 8"" x 4"" (20cm x 10cm) and feature our Kaloli logo. Fun fact: these are the same stickers we used to brand our briquette buckets!</p>
<p>For $15, you will receive a hand-written thank you note from the co-founders in gratitude of your support!</p>
<p>For $25, you can receive a stylish Kaloli-branded t-shirt (sizes small through large)to up your fashion game in the fall and throughout the year. Lydia, one of our employees, is modeling the shirts in the photo below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506369249/vwfxme6who8l13p9le9k.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For a $50 gift, Kaloli will give an eco-stove to a family in Kampala. Eco-stoves cook more efficiently-- utilizing less fuel and keeping the air cleaner. This stove will be used by the family for many years to cook meals in their homes and leave a smaller impact on the environment. We will also send you a personal thank-you card for your support.</p>
<p>Also at the $50 level is a chance to grab coffee with two Kaloli co-founders! We'll buy you coffee at your choice of cafe in the Twin Cities area to discuss Kaloli, Kampala, and learn from your insights.</p>
<p>For $500 total, we will barbecue for you! We will bring our own Kampalan cookstove to your home to prepare the Kampalan dish, rolex-- a traditional food made with chapati (a type of flatbread), eggs, and vegetables. We will also be offering traditional Minnesotan cookout food as we describe our time in Kampala and discuss our plans for next steps.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Kaloli wants to make alternative energy so convenient that it becomes the obvious choice. Your gift will support the briquette innovators fighting to decrease the deforestation of Uganda driven by the charcoal industry. When we reach 200 customers, we will be saving 50 tons of trees per month, and in a city of 1.9 million the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>Kaloli also provides employment to Ugandans. As a sustainable business, we provide stable, well-paid jobs to our employees, who in turn provide us with critical perspectives of how others might perceive our project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We believe in the Kaloli business model, but we know that we need more customer interaction to determine whether the idea will sink or swim long-term. Doing a pilot of a company is all about hypothesis-testing, which means that no matter how hard we try there’s a chance Kaloli will not appeal to the people of Kampala.</p>
<p>Our backgrounds qualify us to explore these questions thoroughly, and search diligently for solutions. </p>

Now the fate of Long Wharf Park is <a href=""http://www.ma-appellatecourts.org/search_number.php?dno=sjc-11134"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on appeal before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a>. Constitutional rights are upheld, or lost, in court. Fortunately, we have retained the <a href=""http://mcgregorlaw.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">oldest environmental law firm in New England</a>, involved in park protection and litigation for over 35 years. For legal expenses, we need to raise $35,000, and are turning to our strongest supporters and asking for your contribution.</p>
<p>Don't keep your money molding in your wallet! It cannot do more good than in protecting this historic place, a park of quiet and repose at the end of the oldest working wharf in the United States.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q. Has the press covered the story?</h4>
<p>A. Yes: see <a href=""http://savelongwharfpark.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://savelongwharfpark.org</a></p>
<h4>Q. How else can I help?</h4>
<p>A. Tell your friends and contacts, including journalists (print, blog, television).</p>
<h4>Q. What is special about Long Wharf Park?</h4>
<p>Long Wharf Park is at the harbor end of the oldest working wharf in the United States, and is Boston's farthest projection into the harbor. In colonial times, it was the landing site for nearly all British troops that came to Boston, and in March 1776, was their evacuation point.</p>
<h4>Q. Who are the North End Ten?</h4>
<p>A. We are ten Massachusetts residents connected to Boston's North End neighborhood who oppose the city and state's flipping a historic park in violation of the Massachusetts Constitution. The Ten are professionals and retirees, without any personal interest, and want to retain the park free for public use as the most beautiful and serene spot on the waterfront of a busy city. We have fought for the park without any outside financial support.</p>
<h4>Q. How did you fund the legal expenses before?</h4>
<p>We are unusual as a citizens' group in having represented ourselves in the administrative and Superior Court proceedings. We stayed up late researching and writing our legal briefs, and investing collectively 2000 hours of sweat equity. However, by appealing to the Supreme Judicial Court, the BRA and DEP have said, ""Double or nothing!"" To defend our victory in Superior Court, and have the largest chance of protecting Long Wharf Park, it is now time for outside legal help. Even David needed a slingshot.</p>
<h4>Q. Who pays the BRA and DEP's legal fees?</h4>
<p>A. The DEP is represented by the office of the Massachusetts Attorney General, so the Massachusetts taxpayer is funding their case. The BRA is represented by two to three law partners at an outside law firm; the funds are coming from the BRA's income and assets (which once belonged to the public).</p>
<p>We had filed a freedom of information request asking how much they had spent on legal costs. They mostly refused to give the information, but eventually said that they had spent $67,000 on outside counsel. Although this cost was prior to the Supreme Judicial Court appeal, it seems unrealistically low.</p>
<h4>Q. Why shouldn't the park become a late-night restaurant?</h4>
<p>A. The park is protected by <a href=""http://protectmassenvironment.org/article_97.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Article 97 of the amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution</a>, which requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature before parkland can be converted to other uses. This vote has never happened, and the BRA claims that the vote is not needed. Meanwhile, there are a half-dozen restaurants and bars within a five-minute walk of Long Wharf Park, and nearly 100 restaurants in the nearby North End neighborhood. There is no need for another restaurant and bar.</p>
<h4>Q. What is the BRA and DEP's argument?</h4>
<p>A. The <a href=""http://savelongwharfpark.org/LegalDocuments?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=bra-sjc-brief.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BRA argues</a> that, because it took the land for urban renewal, it was taken for a public purpose distinct from the environmental protections that are the subject of <a href=""http://protectmassenvironment.org/article_97.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Article 97</a>. The <a href=""http://savelongwharfpark.org/LegalDocuments?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=dep-sjc-brief.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DEP argues</a> that its license to the BRA does not violate the constitution, because it is not a change of use or a change of control. We disagree with their arguments (as did the Superior Court judge).</p>
<p>If the BRA's view should prevail, the BRA could invoke motherhood, apple pie, and parks to gain support for urban renewal, later flipping the parks when convenient or profitable.</p>
<h4>Q. What is the constitutional protection for parkland?</h4>
<p>In Massachusetts, public parks, and other natural-resources lands, have had constitutional protection since 1972, when <a href=""http://protectmassenvironment.org/article_97.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Article 97</a> was passed by referendum. It requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of the legislature before public parkland can be converted to other uses. This vote, and the public debate it would require, has never happened.</p>
<h4>Q. How did the case get to the Supreme Judicial Court?</h4>
<p>A. In 2008, in a DEP administrative proceeding, we appealed the DEP's license, and we lost in 2010. In 2010 we sued the BRA and DEP in Superior Court, and we won in 2011. The BRA appealed directly to the Supreme Judicial Court, who will hear oral arguments this fall.</p>
<h4>Q. Where can I learn more details, such as the court documents?</h4>

<p><strong><img alt=""Paraguayan Youth at the second camp in October of 2012"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-r1ZcSLpJucA/UJE39amTO4I/AAAAAAAAIpc/nkkfabUyZPk/s640/GEDC2007.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""Paraguayan Youth at the second camp in October of 2012, Yacyreta Sand Dunes""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong>:</p>
<p>Paraguay is a nation rich in environmental resources, notable especially for migratory bird populations, diverse wildlife and some of the last remaining stands of the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest. Yet much of the country's biodiversity faces many challenges, such as: land-use conversion, over-hunting and grazing, and other environmentally damaging practices. Many Paraguayans recognize these problems and are seeking ways to take action to preserve, replenish, and sustainably manage their country's natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong>:</p>
<p>While Paraguay is environmentally rich, its best resource is its people. With over half of the population under the age of 25, Paraguayan youth are shaping the future of their country and its impact on the world. By providing young Paraguayans with the tools and guidance, we can foster a new generation of informed and dedicated young leaders to pioneer and inspire a movement of environmental sustainability and stewardship across the country.</p>

<p>By bringing together over 100 youth from across the nation, young Paraguayans will have the opportunity to learn more about environmental problems in Paraguay, share ideas and experiences, and collaborate on solutions for their respective communities. The camp provides a national platform for young Paraguayans to discuss local issues and share strategies for solutions in a fun and empowering atmosphere. Youth return to their communities capable of starting or enhancing an environmental youth group and implementing an action plan. Paraguay Verde also provides the opportunity for youth to develop a dialogue on environmental themes, promoting their inclusion in the local and national discourse around Paraguay’s sustainable future.</p>

<p><strong>Successes</strong>:</p>
<p>The fantastic successes of the past two Paraguay Verde youth camps, held in February and October of 2012, has led to a network of youth leaders already hard at work across Paraguay.  New environmental youth groups are being formed and many communities are organizing environmental events, such as tree plantings. Over 150 Paraguayan youth attended the past two camps where they strengthened leadership skills, met other young environmental leaders from across the country, learned about global and national environmental issues, and developed action plans to tackle these issues in their own communities.</p>
<p>During the past two camps Paraguayan youth planted over 100 native tree species, participated in youth leadership panels, practiced worm composting, and made eco-bricks, plastic bottles filled with inorganic wastelike plastic bags and Styrofoam, to demonstrate more sustainable and economically beneficial methods of waste and resource management.</p>
<p>After attending a Paraguay Verde camp, one group carried out a campaign to collect 100 kilos of batteries at their schools while educating their peers about the potential contamination caused by disposing the batteries in the nearby wetlands. Another group used the eco-bricks they learned to make during a Paraguay Verde camp to build wall out of eco-bricks outside the community’s health post.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong>:</p>
<p>We need your support to put our plan into action! Your contribution will go directly towards funding the third Paraguay Verde camp for the 100 youth expected to come this year. It only takes $75 to sponsor one youth for the duration of the camp, enabling young environmental leaders who may otherwise be unable to attend, to participate in this transformative experience!  The youth themselves will also be contributing to their experience by fundraising locally to cover transportation expenses to the camp.</p>

</div></div>","Jake is an artist who travels to conventions to display his art and Sara is an archaeologist who follows projects and contractors state-to-state. We are marrying on October 4th, and are building a Micro-Home. This sustainable, portable house will minimize our impact on the environment and allow us greater flexibility for both our professions. 
   What Does Building a Tiny Home Require?

Sara has a good background in simple construction, and both of us have great resources in the form of relatives and friends who are dedicating time and brainpower to help with any kinks. 

Our first big purchase is our base -- a 24' flatbed trailer, but the majority of our funding will go toward building supplies. We have a detailed budget and have pegged the building costs to be just over $12,000.

We are hoping to install photovoltaics to help with (or eliminate!) energy costs. We have a great friend who has made a career out of sustainability and off-grid living who will help us perfect these details. We have done a lot of research into the growing field of tiny homes. Our initial design (and inspiration) was based on Molecule Tiny Homes and Tumbleweed Tiny House Company though we are modifying materials and plans to decrease weight, increase stability and personalize the space.

Other great resources regarding the actual construction are Build A Tiny House and the Facebook-page blog, Ben Builds A Tiny House.

The pirates of the Junk Raft Armada, need  your help to raise awareness of the unacceptable amount of waste our society generates, and how much of it is ending up in our rivers. 
The crew, consisting of an international mix of builders, activists and performers from as far as New Zealand and South Africa, have come together in Calafou in Spain. Our goal is to build a fleet of rafts, made mostly from things scavenged from the streets of Barcelona, and to sail them down the Rio Ebro. Along the way we plan to stage performances and spread awareness of how easily things get discarded, how objects that people consider junk can be repurposed and the critical level of pollution in our waterways and oceans. 
Once our fleet is completed we will navigate from Tudela all the way to Caspe, from the 20th of July to the 20th of August. 
Your contribution will help us spread these urgent messages :
We live in a society that generally disregards the planet we inhabit. Our planet’s oceans are one of humanity’s most important natural resources. In recent times we have begun to push the limits of the oceans and we must start utilizing them in a more sustainable way.
There are various sources of pollution to the ocean –acidification, eutrophication, toxin run offs underwater noise and many to advocate but none are more prominent and threatening than plastic debris.

 
Every year, 300 million tonnes of plastic is produced. ½ of which is used once and thrown away and 14 billion pounds are dumped into the ocean.
The consequences are as widespread as the problem is complex. And the problem is not limited to the ocean.
We are destroying our most important resources.
We need to urgently alert people.
We need to work with the planet that sustains us, to stop wasting water, to reconsider the rate at which we consume and discard the amount of trash we are producing. We want to share the upcycling methods and solutions to the end this disaster.
In short, we want to help to keep our livelyhood running.
We are on-site now, working around the clock to ensure that this project is a success. We need your help to raise funds for the things we would rather not pick out of a dumpster,  essential safety equipment (life vests, radios, fire extinguishers...) We also prefer to use new fixings on the rafts (screws and bolts, ropes, as well as welding and drill bits – see a video of Ants trying to straighten an old nail, here.)
