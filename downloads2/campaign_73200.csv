Our desire is to help children in foster care. We work to educate the community on the children’s needs, recruit foster/adoptive parents and mentors, and procure child specific resources to help these children achieve their maximum potential while filling their lives with hope and promise for the future. We are currently developing a children’s home, so we will be able to provide more safe homes for our children in Northwest FL.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p><strong>Vision: </strong>To faciliate, encourage, and publicize the need for foster/adoption/mentoring of special needs children in foster care as being defined as: Children over 10 years of age, minority groups, sibling groups, and children with mental and/or physical handicaps. We intend to inspire and educate community members that otherwise would not have considered serving these children in such capacity. We are coordinating resources for special needs foster children that will enhance their quality of life and assist them in maximizing their potential for independence while meeting their unique challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Our Values</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dignity- </strong>We believe that every person is valuable and deserves to be treated with dignity, courtesy, respect, and consideration for their individuality.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity- </strong>We will adhere to high Christian moral and ethical principles in our choices and our relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Objectivity- </strong>We will use unbiased, creative thinking to guide our actions and reactions to best promote our organizational goals.</p>
<p><strong>Service- </strong>We will treat our children and peers with compassion and demonstrate a servant heart with kindness and diligence.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability- </strong>We will promote an atmosphere of transparency that will produce corporate accountability and yield a high level of trust in our organization.</p>

for expansion with its 5 acre footprint and 25,000 sq. ft. of existing

In 2013, I figured out a way to bring my two passions in life together - running and animals! As a Pet Parent myself, I have adopted my furry family members from rescue groups and found I wanted to help these groups further - thus CAT Running was born! I created this company to bring people together, for the love of the run and the love of animals, to help local animal rescue groups. These groups provide a wonderful service in finding forever homes for our furry friends, education on the importance of spaying and neutering, and providing love for animals in need. Often, these small organizations do not receive funding other than donations. As my Charity Partner, I can help provide further funds to these organizations, bring awareness to their efforts and ultimately help pets find their forever homes. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520892960/lypiaheapzgi8fshwwtl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>By way of introduction, I spent over 25 successful years in the Hospitality and Media fields doing Sales and Revenue Management. In 2010, I started running local races and my passion grew - this is what inspired me! In my spare time throughout 2013 I researched local running events and venues. By March of 2014 I partnered with a local animal rescue group as my Charity Partner and launched the Inaugural CAT Running 5K in Redmond, Washington. This year we will celebrate the 5th Annual CAT Running 5K with the same fabulous local animal rescue group! In late 2017, I decided I needed to move my career full time to do what I love - produce and hold 5K run/walk events to help animals! As further commitment to pursuing my dream to expand, I recently became an RRCA Certified Race Director (Road Runners Club of America). This will allow me to work with municipalities across the Nation as I work to take CAT Running nationwide. </p><p>CAT Running is dedicated to holding the best running/walking events whether you are a first-time walker or a veteran runner. Even now, we have a strong percentage of runners who return each year. They thank us for the opportunity to be able to help their local animal rescue organizations and enjoy the fun and organized events. It is exciting to see some of the participants bring more fun to the event by dressing up in cat related items/costumes, bringing their dogs to run with them and who knows, one day we will have a cat run along, too!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520894206/iqkrh4gfb4wzuiqdc3zj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>People love their pets and/or simply love animals, so they come out to lend their support! Research from the American Pet Product Association, shows that people spent $66.75 billion on their pets in the U.S. in 2016 and were targeted to spend $69.36 billion in 2017. According to Running in the USA, “In 2016, the 5K maintained the #1 position of all race distances with 8.2 million finishers."" Bringing these two segments together shows great possibilities for CAT Running and helping animals! </p><p>This campaign is extremely important to me because in order to reach more cities and help more animals, I need funding for further marketing and event supplies. I truly believe in the importance of this venue and the impact it has on communities and local animal rescue groups. While there are wonderful running events out there supporting other charity partners, no one nationwide is doing events to support the local animal rescues. There is an absolute need to raise awareness of these organizations, as they survive by way of donations and volunteers. CAT Running is committed to taking our events nationwide and helping animals across the country! </p><p>I am seeking funding to increase my marketing budget, purchase more event supplies, and expand the reach. Marketing funds would be used to further market with social media, advertise with running event websites, radio jingles in new cities and a trailer with logo. Examples of event supplies include traffic cones, course markers, tents, tables, and banners/signage. Even if I don’t obtain my overall goal, the money funded will go towards these items. I will continue to seek corporate event sponsors and continue to self-fund. </p><p>We have several unique perks available at different giving levels to help CAT Running go nationwide!

In 2013, I figured out a way to bring my two passions in life together - running and animals! As a Pet Parent myself, I have adopted my furry family members from rescue groups and found I wanted to help these groups further - thus CAT Running was born! I created this company to bring people together, for the love of the run and the love of animals, to help local animal rescue groups. These groups provide a wonderful service in finding forever homes for our furry friends, education on the importance of spaying and neutering, and providing love for animals in need. Often, these small organizations do not receive funding other than donations. As my Charity Partner, I can help provide further funds to these organizations, bring awareness to their efforts and ultimately help pets find their forever homes. By way of introduction, I spent over 25 successful years in the Hospitality and Media fields doing Sales and Revenue Management. In 2010, I started running local races and my passion grew - this is what inspired me! In my spare time throughout 2013 I researched local running events and venues. By March of 2014 I partnered with a local animal rescue group as my Charity Partner and launched the Inaugural CAT Running 5K in Redmond, Washington. This year we will celebrate the 5th Annual CAT Running 5K with the same fabulous local animal rescue group! In late 2017, I decided I needed to move my career full time to do what I love - produce and hold 5K run/walk events to help animals! As further commitment to pursuing my dream to expand, I recently became an RRCA Certified Race Director (Road Runners Club of America). This will allow me to work with municipalities across the Nation as I work to take CAT Running nationwide. CAT Running is dedicated to holding the best running/walking events whether you are a first-time walker or a veteran runner. Even now, we have a strong percentage of runners who return each year. They thank us for the opportunity to be able to help their local animal rescue organizations and enjoy the fun and organized events. It is exciting to see some of the participants bring more fun to the event by dressing up in cat related items/costumes, bringing their dogs to run with them and who knows, one day we will have a cat run along, too!People love their pets and/or simply love animals, so they come out to lend their support! Research from the American Pet Product Association, shows that people spent $66.75 billion on their pets in the U.S. in 2016 and were targeted to spend $69.36 billion in 2017. According to Running in the USA, “In 2016, the 5K maintained the #1 position of all race distances with 8.2 million finishers."" Bringing these two segments together shows great possibilities for CAT Running and helping animals! This campaign is extremely important to me because in order to reach more cities and help more animals, I need funding for further marketing and event supplies. I truly believe in the importance of this venue and the impact it has on communities and local animal rescue groups. While there are wonderful running events out there supporting other charity partners, no one nationwide is doing events to support the local animal rescues. There is an absolute need to raise awareness of these organizations, as they survive by way of donations and volunteers. CAT Running is committed to taking our events nationwide and helping animals across the country! I am seeking funding to increase my marketing budget, purchase more event supplies, and expand the reach. Marketing funds would be used to further market with social media, advertise with running event websites, radio jingles in new cities and a trailer with logo. Examples of event supplies include traffic cones, course markers, tents, tables, and banners/signage. Even if I don’t obtain my overall goal, the money funded will go towards these items. I will continue to seek corporate event sponsors and continue to self-fund. We have several unique perks available at different giving levels to help CAT Running go nationwide!

<p>Hi, I’m Jerome. I am a chiropractor, and my partner, K is a massage therapist and we have a big vision for Eau Claire, WI. It’s our home, and we have met a lot of people throughout the years who struggle to make ends meet. Every day in our practice, we work with stress; whether it’s physical, chemical, or emotional, stress has a harmful effect on our health, especially if it’s present all the time. Ultimately, people being under constant stress is what brings them to our office, yet in too many cases, stress is what keeps them away. Specifically, the stress of not having the money to meet their needs. Since I was a chiropractic student, I have had a vision to create an affordable, accessible clinic for chiropractic care in the Chippewa Valley. When I found out that K shared a very similar vision, it just made sense to join forces.</p>
<p>For this to work, we need to be in the office as much as possible, doing the work that allows us to make this impact. We are, and will continue to build the “traditional” side of the business. This is what pays the bills, keeps the doors open and the lights on.</p>
<p>We’re at the stage where I need to work a part-time job outside of my office to pay my own bills. This, was fully expected, and we have no qualms with doing this. The faster we can get past that stage, the faster we can realize our desire to serve all walks of life at Balanced Path Chiropractic.</p>
<p><strong>The Brass tacks:</strong></p>
<p>We need $5,000.00 to keep the business moving in the right direction, so we can open our doors to those in real financial need as soon as possible. Our overhead is very low as a matter of principle. I am choosing not to participate in the insurance system, and as a result I can pass the savings on to the consumer. K’s side of the business is more established, and she also maintains a low overhead. All funds received will be used to offset our expenses (it could pay rent for nearly an entire year) so we can keep focused on growth.</p>
<p>You, the contributor, will get what we do best in exchange for your dollars: chiropractic adjustments and massage! Entry level contributions will earn gift certificates that spend like cash. Those who are able give more will receive full care plans, based not on a dollar amount, but on what care you need, and will likely far outpace the investment.</p>
<p>Imagine the impact of helping make this a reality. There are people in our town, right now, for a wide range of reasons, that simply cannot afford to get the kind of health care that they need. Perhaps an injury is keeping them from their work and a series of adjustments, massage, or both would be the exact thing that would get them back to work. In our broken system of “health insurance”, there are people who fall between the cracks all the time, or find that they simply don’t have coverage for anything but an absolute crisis.</p>
<p>Your investment in Balanced Path Chiropractic &amp; Wayfaring Massage can help us close these gaps! Thank you so much for everything you do...</p>

<p>(Pro-Tip: Jump down to The Loot section to learn what Quest Inn merch you could have.)</p>
<h3>About The DM</h3>
<p>Everyone has to start somewhere. </p>
<p>It's crazy to think that in the last year I have gone from having a dream that combines my biggest passions in life (D&amp;D and cocktails) to being the director of a business and having negotiated a business sale; but that's exactly what's happened. </p>
<p>Hi, my name's Elliot and I have been a bartender and mixologist for three and a half years. I have managed two bars and one shop and I love fantasy roleplaying games. Managing people has always come fairly naturally to me because I like to lead from the front and listen to the concerns of my staff.  I was once asked by one of my bartenders why I had let a waitress tell me off and I responded that ""She was right. I should have known better"". Managers are people too, they are fallible and make mistakes. I believe that all staff should feel comfortable to give critical feedback to senior staff members as long as it's constructive. As a person who's work life has entirely been in the service industry, I know the way it feels when working the front lines. I personally like it and I get a lot of energy from serving and interacting with customers, but I also know that it's not for everyone; and, also, it isn't unskilled. I want to run a bar where the staff feel like they're being paid what they have earned. I want to pay my staff a living wage that starts with an extra 20p an hour for just being human and rewards the years spent working in the service industry (and further rewards the number of years spent working for my company).  I also believe in giving people a chance: ""No experience but you have the right attitude? Great, we can teach you the rest. Just try to make the most of your potential.""</p>
<p>I have been an active LARPer for probably 13+ years, it's hard to remember which early teens age I was when I started. During my final year of undergraduate study in Aberdeen I got involved in the roleplaying society and, after learning the ropes as a player and then moving to Sheffield after graduation, I picked up the mantle of Dungeon Master (DM). I started by playing a Pathfinder campaign but have since converted over to D&amp;D 5e as my primary system. I also like Vampire: The Masquerade and the stunningly ridiculous Paranoia. </p>
<p>I work hard. At the time of writing I'm the manager of a shop in the centre of York, I'm one of the guides on the York Terror Trail and I'm setting my own company up. Yeah, I'm basically working two and a half jobs but it's all in order to get the future that I really want. That future is a chain of geeky and nerdy bars that bring smiles to people's faces. I'm starting with my favourite genre in the fantasy setting of The Quest Inn, York. I then plan on starting The Spaceship Inn, Leeds (name to be confirmed), a science fiction themed bar in the same model as The Quest Inn. Thereafter, it'll be Whitby for a Dracula/Gothic Horror place, Sheffield for a Wasteland/ Apocalyptic Fallout venue, Newcastle for a Mad Scientist laboratory, and Lincoln for a Steampunk/ Victoriana shindig. The £50,000 campaign investment now is just the start of something huge for cocktail and ale lovers in the North of England. After that? Well, who knows. I wouldn't mind seeing franchised venues popping up across Australia, America, and other countries not beginning with A. </p>
<p>My plan with The Quest Inn is to share myself with the world and to make the world a better place. As a business representation of my hobbies and interests the fantasy cocktail bar will be the first impression on a visiting customer. A top to toe theming will immediately immerse them in a fantasy realm, where they can let their hair down. Anyone stepping off the street will be able to engage and enjoy this aspect of the business and still leave having had a wonderful time and great service. </p>
<p>For most of the week that is all there is to The Quest Inn; great food and great cocktails equalling a great experience. But during the hours that are normally quieter? Well, then we've got something special. The area normally in use as the dining area will be offered up to roleplay groups to play their games in; with a setting that enhances their story telling.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes I hope to use The Quest Inn and Bars and Blades Limited to improve the world little by little. I will attempt to use the success of Bars and Blades Limited to support other ventures and small businesses with similar ethics. The beauty of our world is our diversity. I intend to celebrate that.</p>

With the £50,000 I am seeking I will be able to secure a bank loan to purchase a profitable restaurant in York, Fiesta Latina. I have agreed a sale price of £125,000 for Fiesta Latina. If this campaign can make that lofty target then it will all be down to the support of the people that The Quest Inn comes to life. I will then use my experience from managing in a similar restaurant to run Fiesta Latina for a whole year. I will use this year and Fiesta Latina's established trade to better learn the practicalities of business ownership. After making the most of the Valentines Day trade in 2019, I will use the business' profits to convert the venue into The Quest Inn. I plan to re-open as The Quest Inn during March of 2019.</p>
<p>The business revenue as The Quest Inn will be mostly derived from food and drinks sales as with any standard bar but there will also be the income from merchandise sales, table hire, and miniatures hire. </p>
<p>£50,000 will be enough to encourage the banks to invest in The Quest Inn and I will be then be able to use Fiesta Latina's cash-flow to support the rest of the business' requirements. Fiesta Latina itself is still a profitable business. Some people have expressed concerns about why it should be on the market but it's simply a case of retirement for the current owner. </p>
<p>In my years I have managed to gather a lot of experience in managing people but, because I worked in the service industry not far out of London until just over a year ago, I have not been able to gather much capital of my own. Pretty much all that I had went into the business planning stages that prepared for the launch of the campaign and into the marketing of the campaign.</p>
<p>I have a plan but I need your help to bring it to life. If you want to join the party and bring The Quest Inn into existence then as your Dungeon Master I will reward you handsomely with loot. </p>
<p>Let's get back to details about The Quest Inn:</p>
<h3>Making the World Brighter</h3>
<p>The Quest Inn's moral ethos will be built around two key principals: happy staff and happy customers.</p>
<p>To achieve these aims, The Quest Inn will aim to become a living wage employer within its first two years of trading and will operate a transparency policy regarding pay and pay-based incentives for long-standing staff members. Our employees will be at the forefront of our care and every effort will be made to make The Quest Inn a good, honest and enjoyable working environment for all our staff members. We believe that by looking after our staff we will simultaneously improve the customer service experience for our customers, thereby helping us to achieve our other key aim of happy customers alongside our dedication to producing an inventive and delicious cocktail menu; beautifully cooked and presented food; a great and welcoming atmosphere; and, a supportive and encouraging community space.</p>
<p>When entering The Quest Inn for the first time the sight of medieval tavern décor and fantasy costumed staff will greet our customers. The Quest Inn will work hard to provide a friendly and inclusive gaming and restaurant experience that will actively lead the way in creating and promoting a supportive gaming community for both residents and visitors in York.</p>
<p>As a gastro-bar the food will be very important but the drinks will be the primary focus of most of the creative energy. The cocktail menu will feature geek and pop culture named cocktails (and mocktails) and will change regularly; affording the customers a different experience with each visit and encouraging return custom. There will also be a range of locally produced ales from across the burgeoning Yorkshire craft brewing industry as well as a hand selected range of ciders and wines. Our food menu will feature exceptional cuisine for starters, mains, deserts, and table plates (large sharing, feast style, dishes); all presented in keeping with the medieval fantasy theme. There will be generous considerations for vegetarians and other diners with dietary requirements.</p>
<p>As part of the community aspect of the company ethos, and to help combat the midweek slump in trade, Monday to Thursday nights will host table-top gaming evenings. These will enable role-play groups to hire the large tables to play table-top role-play games (RPGs) in an inspiring and immersive environment. We plan to work with the university and other gaming societies in York and will encourage them to host their meetings in The Quest Inn for a reduced rate per head. We also plan to set up mutual marketing and cross-promotional benefits with other gaming enterprises in York. By building these professional relationships The Quest Inn aims to create a central hub for the growing community of gamers in York that will connect and support them, whilst also enriching the cultural life of York.</p>
<h3>The Sights and Sounds</h3>
<p>The Quest Inn is about providing a fun and safe space for gamers, geeks and medieval enthusiasts to socialise and enjoy great cocktails and food at reasonable prices, as well as adding a dynamic must-visit dining experience to York's thriving tourism scene. The two levels of the Fiesta Latina building will enable the venue to facilitate a duel experience, with the entrance level housing the bar and the more casual areas and the second level being the primary dining and gaming area. This will allow separation of gamers and diners from the main bar to segregate the cocktail bar and dining experiences for the comfort of each patron.</p>
<p>Our food will be excellently cooked rustic food befitting of a medieval banquet but with a flavourful twist. Fiesta Latina currently employs some excellent chefs with a background in Brazilian cuisine it is the intention to keep these chefs on to create dynamic food with a Latin flavour contrasted by a medieval appearance, as befits the fantasy freedom of the theming.</p>
<p>The naming conventions for all dishes and drinks will be drawn from fantasy pop culture references like ‘Totally-Not-Rat-On-A-Stick’ (inspired by Terry Pratchett's 'Rat-Onna-Stick'), and 'Meat-Inna-Bun' both derived from the dishes of C.M.O.T. Dibbler in the Discworld series. Other dishes will be inspired by different medieval-inspired fantasy franchises and tropes, like a Lord of the Rings meat feast dish called “Ork Lunch”; and of course ""Lembas Bread"".</p>
<p>The cocktail menu, however, will be a lot more fluid. New creations will regularly be added to the menu but there will always be a solid baseline of the classics from the cocktail industry available. Furthermore, the bartenders will be encouraged to broaden their skills and research new techniques. One of our other key aims is to support local craft ale brewers by stocking their cask ales. A few bottled beers will also be available. Our hope is that by working with local breweries we will be able to create an authentic medieval tavern experience. To cater to customers who don’t like cocktails and ales there will be a small range of wines and ciders on offer. A soft drinks range will also be available, primarily led by which ones are required as mixers in the cocktails recipes. The Pepsi products currently used by Fiesta Latina will be continued.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of a medieval tavern with period decoration, including fantasy props and treasures, will be enhanced by ambient music befitting a medieval minstrel. The servers will enhance this fantasy atmosphere through fantasy-themed outfits; however, they won’t be asked to affect false accents or ‘put on a show’ as the intended result is for immersion and not farce.</p>
<p>Our hope is to ensnare every sense in order to fully immerse our patrons in to the Quest Inn fantasy realm to the point where they really feel transported into another world. The whole experience will be a form of escapism with customers leaving the Quest Inn blinking at the sudden return to reality.</p>
<p>This sense of immersion will be key for the ‘Tabletop Evenings’. Groups of roleplayers will be able to hire a table for a reasonable fee, with prices becoming more reasonable if bulk session subscriptions are made. There will be scope for RPG tournaments and competitions to be held in the space as well. A library of miniatures and terrain pieces will be available for roleplayers to enhance their gaming experience even more. It also won’t be limited to tabletop roleplayers, as the space will fit well with hosting Live Action Role-Play groups too.</p>
<p>Customers will also be able to take away branded merchandise as a reminder of their trip. Items like tankards and dice bags will be available for purchase over the bar.</p>
<p>Our target audience will include students, young professionals and tourists. We aim to attract attention from these groups by partnering with student unions, societies, other local game shops and Visit York. We also hope that we can build up strong rapport with existing customers of Fiesta Latina so that they will be encouraged to continue their patronage. Furthermore, we trust that our location’s proximity to Clifford’s Tower, Jorvik Viking Centre, and the York Dungeon will also entice new customers both local and tourist alike.</p>
<h3>The Loot</h3>
<p>The Story of the Adventurer.</p>
<p>Our brave hero climbs the ranks from lowest level one to the most accomplished individual of their time. A story unfolds as you read through the perks of the adventurer's tier.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510698630/aecw4w2lnkczauaeowp3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This table shows what can be found in each tier of the Adventurer's Story. </p>
<p>For each rung of the perk ladder you will get all that has come before you. So, the more you want the higher you go. </p>
<p>As with all good RPGs the more risk taken the better the loot. </p>
<p>The Wall of Fame will be on the ground floor and visible as you enter the bar. Your name on the Wall of Fame can either be your own or one of your RPG character's names. The Portraits will be painted by local York artists and can either be of yourselves or of your favourite character that you have played in tabletop RPGs. </p>
<p>The Adventurer's Card will be like your own personal character card and will grant you 5% off at any Bars and Blades venue for life. The Hero's Card is the same but with 10% off. </p>
<p>The Dice bags, Tankards, and Dice sets will all have the Q Logo (seen in the campaign overview) on them.</p>
<p>The Drinks Tokens will grant you one free drink upon presentation of your token to The Quest Inn. Any one drink will be permitted. </p>
<p>The 10x Tabletop Sessions will be 10 individual bookings of a table in The Quest Inn during Tabletop Evenings. The year's subscription is for an individual and limited in usage only by one calendar year (as many bookings as desired can be made by that individual in that year.</p>
<p>The Handmade Cloak will be just like the one I am wearing in the video. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Character Perks:</p>
<p>As our hero progresses they meet new and interesting characters. Their stories can be seen in the perks list along with the items associated with them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is my first venture and as concepts go it's no small plan. I do have experience in the day to day management of a venue like Fiesta Latina and that is why I have given myself one year in charge of that business. In that one year, spent running Fiesta Latina, I will be able to gain all of the necessary knowledge to be able to make the right decisions for The Quest Inn from a financial and legal standpoint, to add to my existing knowledge on practical management. It will also give me one year to put in place all of the necessary resources to have a quick transformation time. </p>
<p>The Quest Inn's concept is born out of a huge and still growing, yet still slightly socially marginalised, community of geeks who are always seeking connectivity and social hubs. The digital market already caters to the tabletop RPG community with online shows like Critical Role, Maze Arcana, and Acquisitions Incorporated; each with up to tens of thousands of followers. Whilst this market is being catered for in the digital space it is not being exploited in physical space. This leaves a gap in the market that hasn’t yet been addressed. The Quest Inn aims to exploit this gap in the market by catering specifically to this community but in a manner that should prove attractive to a broad array of audiences. It's in reaching out to those audiences that there is a challenge. Not an insurmountable challenge though.</p>
<p>As this business concept is new to both the bar industry and to the gaming industry there isn’t a benchmark for this model of business. This provides a unique opportunity for marketing and business collaborations and also means that there initially wouldn’t be much in the way of direct competition. Places like Trembling Madness, Stonegate, and the Golden Fleece, Pavement, would be the closest competitors for the atmosphere however they lack the gaming and geek culture aspect of The Quest Inn and also the late-night catering facilities.</p>
<p>There is already a trend in York towards catering to the gaming market with physical spaces but all of the current set ups are only concerned with video games or board games. The retailer Game has recently opened its Belong York gaming area. Pop culture and gaming café’s like Random Encounter on Gillygate, are a trending business model across the country and blend board games with eateries. What is so unique about The Quest Inn is that it will tackle this trend from an entirely new perspective and it will give tabletop RPGs a dedicated space of their own.</p>
<p>Venues like Tavern Brabant, Prague; The Croft Institute, Melbourne; and ABQ, London all encapsulate a specific theme that enraptures and entertains their patrons whilst delivering exceptional service. Like these examples The Quest Inn will deliver an exceptional experience centred around cocktails that enriches the community at the same time. York’s new Viking bar Valhalla, is also be a themed venue but lacks the diversity of services that The Quest Inn will have and it also lacks the commitment to a theme with only the décor representing the idea. Having such a prominent theme can result in customers enjoying the experience and then ticking it off their bucket list. This means that return custom is a challenge but that is why so much time and energy will be put into making the available food and drinks the reason to come back. </p>
<p>Many roleplay groups have had to find their own spaces in community halls for the purposes of hosting their meetups. Travelling Man does its best to cater to the geek and pop-culture community but as it’s trying to please so many gaming genres it can only provide one night a week to the RPG fans. These venues also lack the catering and refreshments aspect of The Quest Inn and close much earlier in the evening. Reaching out to these groups will require a lot of work and discussions about their requirements.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Business expansion is the ultimate plan. Once The Quest Inn is completely established in York then work will begin on the first stage of the expansion in Leeds. With geek culture being so varied the fantasy setting of York’s Quest Inn won’t necessarily represent all geeks so each subsequent bar will feature a different genre. The business style will not change only the setting. The aim is to open the second venue within the next 5 years.</p>
<p>The Leeds bar will feature a Sci-Fi theme. Sliding doors that have typical Sci-Fi opening sounds; posters for Vogon poetry readings coming soon (but never actually happening); and a brown duster coat hanging behind the bar will all be but a few of the less obvious nods to Sci-Fi franchises that have captured the imaginations of so many geeks.</p>
<p>Following the Leeds bar will be a Dracula/horror bar in Whitby that will exploit the lack of themed evening entertainment in a town famed for its link to Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Also, in the conceptual stage are a Wasteland/ Fallout/ Apocalypse bar in Sheffield and a mad scientist Molecular-Mixology bar in Newcastle. Crowdfunding campaigns will be used to help fund and market these expansions with the focus being on raising money to expand the existing customer base. “Collecting the set” will be encouraged, with tankards and merchandise available at each location.</p>
<p>Inspiration for this explosive level of expansion comes from businesses like BrewDog and Loch Fyne who rapidly expanded across the country.</p>
<p>There is also the potential for an online RPG show documenting the adventures of a single adventuring party being filmed and hosted in The Quest Inn. We can't be inspired by the likes of Critical Role without wanting to emulate them a little. </p>
<p>As the business expands the staffing requirements will increase. This will open up new job roles in the management tiers, such as Area Managers, and promote wider employment. The aim is staff the bars with enthusiastic and talented individuals; passionate about geek culture, RPGs and providing excellent service.</p>

About The DM
Everyone has to start somewhere. 
It's crazy to think that in the last year I have gone from having a dream that combines my biggest passions in life (D&D and cocktails) to being the director of a business and having negotiated a business sale; but that's exactly what's happened. 
Hi, my name's Elliot and I have been a bartender and mixologist for three and a half years. I have managed two bars and one shop and I love fantasy roleplaying games. Managing people has always come fairly naturally to me because I like to lead from the front and listen to the concerns of my staff.  I was once asked by one of my bartenders why I had let a waitress tell me off and I responded that ""She was right. I should have known better"". Managers are people too, they are fallible and make mistakes. I believe that all staff should feel comfortable to give critical feedback to senior staff members as long as it's constructive. As a person who's work life has entirely been in the service industry, I know the way it feels when working the front lines. I personally like it and I get a lot of energy from serving and interacting with customers, but I also know that it's not for everyone; and, also, it isn't unskilled. I want to run a bar where the staff feel like they're being paid what they have earned. I want to pay my staff a living wage that starts with an extra 20p an hour for just being human and rewards the years spent working in the service industry (and further rewards the number of years spent working for my company).  I also believe in giving people a chance: ""No experience but you have the right attitude? Great, we can teach you the rest. Just try to make the most of your potential.""
I have been an active LARPer for probably 13+ years, it's hard to remember which early teens age I was when I started. During my final year of undergraduate study in Aberdeen I got involved in the roleplaying society and, after learning the ropes as a player and then moving to Sheffield after graduation, I picked up the mantle of Dungeon Master (DM). I started by playing a Pathfinder campaign but have since converted over to D&D 5e as my primary system. I also like Vampire: The Masquerade and the stunningly ridiculous Paranoia. 
I work hard. At the time of writing I'm the manager of a shop in the centre of York, I'm one of the guides on the York Terror Trail and I'm setting my own company up. Yeah, I'm basically working two and a half jobs but it's all in order to get the future that I really want. That future is a chain of geeky and nerdy bars that bring smiles to people's faces. I'm starting with my favourite genre in the fantasy setting of The Quest Inn, York. I then plan on starting The Spaceship Inn, Leeds (name to be confirmed), a science fiction themed bar in the same model as The Quest Inn. Thereafter, it'll be Whitby for a Dracula/Gothic Horror place, Sheffield for a Wasteland/ Apocalyptic Fallout venue, Newcastle for a Mad Scientist laboratory, and Lincoln for a Steampunk/ Victoriana shindig. The £50,000 campaign investment now is just the start of something huge for cocktail and ale lovers in the North of England. After that? Well, who knows. I wouldn't mind seeing franchised venues popping up across Australia, America, and other countries not beginning with A. 
My plan with The Quest Inn is to share myself with the world and to make the world a better place. As a business representation of my hobbies and interests the fantasy cocktail bar will be the first impression on a visiting customer. A top to toe theming will immediately immerse them in a fantasy realm, where they can let their hair down. Anyone stepping off the street will be able to engage and enjoy this aspect of the business and still leave having had a wonderful time and great service. 
For most of the week that is all there is to The Quest Inn; great food and great cocktails equalling a great experience. But during the hours that are normally quieter? Well, then we've got something special. The area normally in use as the dining area will be offered up to roleplay groups to play their games in; with a setting that enhances their story telling.
Behind the scenes I hope to use The Quest Inn and Bars and Blades Limited to improve the world little by little. I will attempt to use the success of Bars and Blades Limited to support other ventures and small businesses with similar ethics. The beauty of our world is our diversity. I intend to celebrate that.

It Begins In A Tavern...
With your help I will be able to start on a project that has the potential to brighten the world a little. With the £50,000 I am seeking I will be able to secure a bank loan to purchase a profitable restaurant in York, Fiesta Latina. I have agreed a sale price of £125,000 for Fiesta Latina. If this campaign can make that lofty target then it will all be down to the support of the people that The Quest Inn comes to life. I will then use my experience from managing in a similar restaurant to run Fiesta Latina for a whole year. I will use this year and Fiesta Latina's established trade to better learn the practicalities of business ownership. After making the most of the Valentines Day trade in 2019, I will use the business' profits to convert the venue into The Quest Inn. I plan to re-open as The Quest Inn during March of 2019.
The business revenue as The Quest Inn will be mostly derived from food and drinks sales as with any standard bar but there will also be the income from merchandise sales, table hire, and miniatures hire. 
£50,000 will be enough to encourage the banks to invest in The Quest Inn and I will be then be able to use Fiesta Latina's cash-flow to support the rest of the business' requirements. Fiesta Latina itself is still a profitable business. Some people have expressed concerns about why it should be on the market but it's simply a case of retirement for the current owner. 
In my years I have managed to gather a lot of experience in managing people but, because I worked in the service industry not far out of London until just over a year ago, I have not been able to gather much capital of my own. Pretty much all that I had went into the business planning stages that prepared for the launch of the campaign and into the marketing of the campaign.
I have a plan but I need your help to bring it to life. If you want to join the party and bring The Quest Inn into existence then as your Dungeon Master I will reward you handsomely with loot. 
Let's get back to details about The Quest Inn:
Making the World Brighter
The Quest Inn's moral ethos will be built around two key principals: happy staff and happy customers.
To achieve these aims, The Quest Inn will aim to become a living wage employer within its first two years of trading and will operate a transparency policy regarding pay and pay-based incentives for long-standing staff members. Our employees will be at the forefront of our care and every effort will be made to make The Quest Inn a good, honest and enjoyable working environment for all our staff members. We believe that by looking after our staff we will simultaneously improve the customer service experience for our customers, thereby helping us to achieve our other key aim of happy customers alongside our dedication to producing an inventive and delicious cocktail menu; beautifully cooked and presented food; a great and welcoming atmosphere; and, a supportive and encouraging community space.
When entering The Quest Inn for the first time the sight of medieval tavern décor and fantasy costumed staff will greet our customers. The Quest Inn will work hard to provide a friendly and inclusive gaming and restaurant experience that will actively lead the way in creating and promoting a supportive gaming community for both residents and visitors in York.
As a gastro-bar the food will be very important but the drinks will be the primary focus of most of the creative energy. The cocktail menu will feature geek and pop culture named cocktails (and mocktails) and will change regularly; affording the customers a different experience with each visit and encouraging return custom. There will also be a range of locally produced ales from across the burgeoning Yorkshire craft brewing industry as well as a hand selected range of ciders and wines. Our food menu will feature exceptional cuisine for starters, mains, deserts, and table plates (large sharing, feast style, dishes); all presented in keeping with the medieval fantasy theme. There will be generous considerations for vegetarians and other diners with dietary requirements.
As part of the community aspect of the company ethos, and to help combat the midweek slump in trade, Monday to Thursday nights will host table-top gaming evenings. These will enable role-play groups to hire the large tables to play table-top role-play games (RPGs) in an inspiring and immersive environment. We plan to work with the university and other gaming societies in York and will encourage them to host their meetings in The Quest Inn for a reduced rate per head. We also plan to set up mutual marketing and cross-promotional benefits with other gaming enterprises in York. By building these professional relationships The Quest Inn aims to create a central hub for the growing community of gamers in York that will connect and support them, whilst also enriching the cultural life of York.
The Sights and Sounds
The Quest Inn is about providing a fun and safe space for gamers, geeks and medieval enthusiasts to socialise and enjoy great cocktails and food at reasonable prices, as well as adding a dynamic must-visit dining experience to York's thriving tourism scene. The two levels of the Fiesta Latina building will enable the venue to facilitate a duel experience, with the entrance level housing the bar and the more casual areas and the second level being the primary dining and gaming area. This will allow separation of gamers and diners from the main bar to segregate the cocktail bar and dining experiences for the comfort of each patron.
Our food will be excellently cooked rustic food befitting of a medieval banquet but with a flavourful twist. Fiesta Latina currently employs some excellent chefs with a background in Brazilian cuisine it is the intention to keep these chefs on to create dynamic food with a Latin flavour contrasted by a medieval appearance, as befits the fantasy freedom of the theming.
The naming conventions for all dishes and drinks will be drawn from fantasy pop culture references like ‘Totally-Not-Rat-On-A-Stick’ (inspired by Terry Pratchett's 'Rat-Onna-Stick'), and 'Meat-Inna-Bun' both derived from the dishes of C.M.O.T. Dibbler in the Discworld series. Other dishes will be inspired by different medieval-inspired fantasy franchises and tropes, like a Lord of the Rings meat feast dish called “Ork Lunch”; and of course ""Lembas Bread"".
The cocktail menu, however, will be a lot more fluid. New creations will regularly be added to the menu but there will always be a solid baseline of the classics from the cocktail industry available. Furthermore, the bartenders will be encouraged to broaden their skills and research new techniques. One of our other key aims is to support local craft ale brewers by stocking their cask ales. A few bottled beers will also be available. Our hope is that by working with local breweries we will be able to create an authentic medieval tavern experience. To cater to customers who don’t like cocktails and ales there will be a small range of wines and ciders on offer. A soft drinks range will also be available, primarily led by which ones are required as mixers in the cocktails recipes. The Pepsi products currently used by Fiesta Latina will be continued.
The atmosphere of a medieval tavern with period decoration, including fantasy props and treasures, will be enhanced by ambient music befitting a medieval minstrel. The servers will enhance this fantasy atmosphere through fantasy-themed outfits; however, they won’t be asked to affect false accents or ‘put on a show’ as the intended result is for immersion and not farce.
Our hope is to ensnare every sense in order to fully immerse our patrons in to the Quest Inn fantasy realm to the point where they really feel transported into another world. The whole experience will be a form of escapism with customers leaving the Quest Inn blinking at the sudden return to reality.
This sense of immersion will be key for the ‘Tabletop Evenings’. Groups of roleplayers will be able to hire a table for a reasonable fee, with prices becoming more reasonable if bulk session subscriptions are made. There will be scope for RPG tournaments and competitions to be held in the space as well. A library of miniatures and terrain pieces will be available for roleplayers to enhance their gaming experience even more. It also won’t be limited to tabletop roleplayers, as the space will fit well with hosting Live Action Role-Play groups too.
Customers will also be able to take away branded merchandise as a reminder of their trip. Items like tankards and dice bags will be available for purchase over the bar.
Our target audience will include students, young professionals and tourists. We aim to attract attention from these groups by partnering with student unions, societies, other local game shops and Visit York. We also hope that we can build up strong rapport with existing customers of Fiesta Latina so that they will be encouraged to continue their patronage. Furthermore, we trust that our location’s proximity to Clifford’s Tower, Jorvik Viking Centre, and the York Dungeon will also entice new customers both local and tourist alike.
The Loot
The Story of the Adventurer.
Our brave hero climbs the ranks from lowest level one to the most accomplished individual of their time. A story unfolds as you read through the perks of the adventurer's tier.

This table shows what can be found in each tier of the Adventurer's Story. 
For each rung of the perk ladder you will get all that has come before you. So, the more you want the higher you go. 
As with all good RPGs the more risk taken the better the loot. 
The Wall of Fame will be on the ground floor and visible as you enter the bar. Your name on the Wall of Fame can either be your own or one of your RPG character's names. The Portraits will be painted by local York artists and can either be of yourselves or of your favourite character that you have played in tabletop RPGs. 
The Adventurer's Card will be like your own personal character card and will grant you 5% off at any Bars and Blades venue for life. The Hero's Card is the same but with 10% off. 
The Dice bags, Tankards, and Dice sets will all have the Q Logo (seen in the campaign overview) on them.
The Drinks Tokens will grant you one free drink upon presentation of your token to The Quest Inn. Any one drink will be permitted. 
The 10x Tabletop Sessions will be 10 individual bookings of a table in The Quest Inn during Tabletop Evenings. The year's subscription is for an individual and limited in usage only by one calendar year (as many bookings as desired can be made by that individual in that year.
The Handmade Cloak will be just like the one I am wearing in the video. 
 
The Character Perks:
As our hero progresses they meet new and interesting characters. Their stories can be seen in the perks list along with the items associated with them.

Risks & Challenges
This is my first venture and as concepts go it's no small plan. I do have experience in the day to day management of a venue like Fiesta Latina and that is why I have given myself one year in charge of that business. In that one year, spent running Fiesta Latina, I will be able to gain all of the necessary knowledge to be able to make the right decisions for The Quest Inn from a financial and legal standpoint, to add to my existing knowledge on practical management. It will also give me one year to put in place all of the necessary resources to have a quick transformation time. 
The Quest Inn's concept is born out of a huge and still growing, yet still slightly socially marginalised, community of geeks who are always seeking connectivity and social hubs. The digital market already caters to the tabletop RPG community with online shows like Critical Role, Maze Arcana, and Acquisitions Incorporated; each with up to tens of thousands of followers. Whilst this market is being catered for in the digital space it is not being exploited in physical space. This leaves a gap in the market that hasn’t yet been addressed. The Quest Inn aims to exploit this gap in the market by catering specifically to this community but in a manner that should prove attractive to a broad array of audiences. It's in reaching out to those audiences that there is a challenge. Not an insurmountable challenge though.
As this business concept is new to both the bar industry and to the gaming industry there isn’t a benchmark for this model of business. This provides a unique opportunity for marketing and business collaborations and also means that there initially wouldn’t be much in the way of direct competition. Places like Trembling Madness, Stonegate, and the Golden Fleece, Pavement, would be the closest competitors for the atmosphere however they lack the gaming and geek culture aspect of The Quest Inn and also the late-night catering facilities.
There is already a trend in York towards catering to the gaming market with physical spaces but all of the current set ups are only concerned with video games or board games. The retailer Game has recently opened its Belong York gaming area. Pop culture and gaming café’s like Random Encounter on Gillygate, are a trending business model across the country and blend board games with eateries. What is so unique about The Quest Inn is that it will tackle this trend from an entirely new perspective and it will give tabletop RPGs a dedicated space of their own.
Venues like Tavern Brabant, Prague; The Croft Institute, Melbourne; and ABQ, London all encapsulate a specific theme that enraptures and entertains their patrons whilst delivering exceptional service. Like these examples The Quest Inn will deliver an exceptional experience centred around cocktails that enriches the community at the same time. York’s new Viking bar Valhalla, is also be a themed venue but lacks the diversity of services that The Quest Inn will have and it also lacks the commitment to a theme with only the décor representing the idea. Having such a prominent theme can result in customers enjoying the experience and then ticking it off their bucket list. This means that return custom is a challenge but that is why so much time and energy will be put into making the available food and drinks the reason to come back. 
Many roleplay groups have had to find their own spaces in community halls for the purposes of hosting their meetups. Travelling Man does its best to cater to the geek and pop-culture community but as it’s trying to please so many gaming genres it can only provide one night a week to the RPG fans. These venues also lack the catering and refreshments aspect of The Quest Inn and close much earlier in the evening. Reaching out to these groups will require a lot of work and discussions about their requirements.
The Future
Business expansion is the ultimate plan. Once The Quest Inn is completely established in York then work will begin on the first stage of the expansion in Leeds. With geek culture being so varied the fantasy setting of York’s Quest Inn won’t necessarily represent all geeks so each subsequent bar will feature a different genre. The business style will not change only the setting. The aim is to open the second venue within the next 5 years.
The Leeds bar will feature a Sci-Fi theme. Sliding doors that have typical Sci-Fi opening sounds; posters for Vogon poetry readings coming soon (but never actually happening); and a brown duster coat hanging behind the bar will all be but a few of the less obvious nods to Sci-Fi franchises that have captured the imaginations of so many geeks.
Following the Leeds bar will be a Dracula/horror bar in Whitby that will exploit the lack of themed evening entertainment in a town famed for its link to Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Also, in the conceptual stage are a Wasteland/ Fallout/ Apocalypse bar in Sheffield and a mad scientist Molecular-Mixology bar in Newcastle. Crowdfunding campaigns will be used to help fund and market these expansions with the focus being on raising money to expand the existing customer base. “Collecting the set” will be encouraged, with tankards and merchandise available at each location.
Inspiration for this explosive level of expansion comes from businesses like BrewDog and Loch Fyne who rapidly expanded across the country.
There is also the potential for an online RPG show documenting the adventures of a single adventuring party being filmed and hosted in The Quest Inn. We can't be inspired by the likes of Critical Role without wanting to emulate them a little. 
As the business expands the staffing requirements will increase. This will open up new job roles in the management tiers, such as Area Managers, and promote wider employment. The aim is staff the bars with enthusiastic and talented individuals; passionate about geek culture, RPGs and providing excellent service.

The goal is to empower the local people of Nicaragua by utilizing its tremendous tourism potential, while minimizing environmental impact.In order to accomplish this, I wish to build a sustainable ecolodge, with the help of others, interested in supporting this cause. The ecolodge will immediately reinvest the profits that it generates to create or fund local and vetted humanitarian and conservation initiatives. It will serve as an educational centre, create employment opportunities and economic benefits for local people. It will also provide free accommodations for legitimate humanitarian organizations and at the same time, it will provide nice and affordable lodging for travellers.For the construction of the lodge, I am using the Cob building technique. After extensive research, I fell in love with Cob building because of its sturdiness, minimal environmental impact, and low cost. Cob is a mixture made from clay, sand, straw and water. It is the key material for the construction of the ecolodge. Cob is natural, fireproof, termite-proof, resistant to seismic activities, inexpensive, easy to build and so much more!                                      The location of the lodge is on a peninsula called Isla Los Brasiles, 30 minutes away from the beautiful colonial city of Leon on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. For the past three years, I have been researching, working, and saving for this project. In order to avoid loans and investors (that could potentially compromise the integrity of the mission for financial gain), I worked for years, while keeping my living costs very lean, so that I could save enough money to purchase the land myself. I have full confidence in the ecolodge, and in May 2014, I completed the purchase of 10,500 square meters of beachfront property. This is now the site of the ecolodge, and already has 50 trees planted by myself and an employee hired to maintain the land. With wild nature, untouched beaches, no cars, amazing sunsets, and millions of stars, it is paradise!!! After the lodge is built, I will manage the lodge using my thorough knowledge of the area, and my extensive experience in hospitality.                                         2015 was the first year of construction and so far we are really proud of what we accomplished.We dug a well...We built a tool shed...we built a Palapa...We started the construction of 2 beach houses... And so much more!But now we need your help to continue.Any kind of help is more than welcome, but there are 4 ways that you can make a big difference.1. Help finance the building of the Carpe Diem Ecolodge.Help jumpstart the project by making a donation to the construction of the ecolodge.

</div> <div> <h3>Tell Me More About the Bromo Seltzer Tower!<br/>
</h3>
<p>The
Bromo Tower’s backstory is quintessential Baltimore and crucial in
understanding the need for its restoration. Captain Isaac E. Emerson, a
Baltimore pharmacist, built the Tower in 1911.<span> 
Emerson invented Bromo Seltzer, a cure for headaches
and hangovers (because if anything, Baltimore is a great drinking town) and in
1891, he organized his own company, the Emerson Drug Company to manufacture the
tonic.           <br/></span></p>

<p>With
a typical Baltimore chip-on-his shoulder, Emerson felt that anything Europe can
do, Baltimore can do better.<span>  Thus the
main feature of his headquarters, the Tower, was inspired by the Palazzo
Vecchio in Florence, Italy.  Emerson
commissioned Joseph E. Sperry to replicate the 13th century stone structure at
21 South Eutaw Street.  Fifteen stories
in height, it was the tallest building in Baltimore until the 1930s.  But the most important facet of the tower is
certainly the clock, its face measuring 24 feet in diameter- larger than Big
Ben in London.</span></p>
<p>Until
1936, the Tower was distinguished by a 51 ft tall replica of the blue Bromo
Seltzer bottle that topped the Tower (after all, in this town you need some
more fun than JUST an ornate renaissance-replica tower that’s the tallest
building in the city).<span>  Alas, the bottle
was far too heavy for the tower to support, and in 1936, the bottle began to
crack and the structure was removed.  Unfortunately
many of the problems facing the building today are attributable to this
engineering flaw.</span></p>
<p>The
Emerson Bromo Seltzer Clock Tower was listed on the National Register of
Historic Places in 1973.<span>  When Emerson
donated the Tower to the City of Baltimore, he did so on the condition that the
Tower would be preserved.</span></p>

<h3><b><u>Why We Need Your Help:</u></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Repairs
are necessary not only for historic preservation but to ensure safety and structural
soundness of the building. Cracks and deterioration in the façade of the
building due to the weight of the 51-foot spinning Bromo bottle that originally
topped the tower have caused leaks and water damage, leading to damage to the
inner workings of the clock. </p>

The club, as of late, has been embracing every style of live music it can find and is, without a doubt, a creatively free space where any passionate individual can organize events and communicate their ideas through music. 
With your contributions we will be building a better platform for artists and those who support them.

<p>Hey, that's me! I've been obsessed with food &amp; restaurants nearly my entire life (28 years so far). It was a trip early on to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Paris</span> that really sparked my love for the culinary world. My pursuits have taken me everywhere from staging at <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Le Cirque</span> in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NYC</span> during high school to putting my own spin on crepes at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DemitasseRoasters/photos/t.420019/354210984602104/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cafe Demitasse </a>in<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> LA</span>. <br/></p>
<p>After college, I trained with a <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Michelin-level</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tea Mastress</span> in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Taipei/Hangzhou</span> and later went on to stage at <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Spice Table</span> in LA while in cooking school. From there, I took my knowledge of Southeast Asian flavors to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Chipotle's Shophouse</span> concept in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">DC</span>. It was there that I really got to immerse myself in ""Wok Cooking"" and develop a passion for the craft as I managed operations for their Georgetown (DC) restaurant. <br/></p>
<p>Most recently, I headed up marketing for <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Aurify Brands</span>' restaurants. I love to cook. But the goal is to become a great restaurateur one day. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Imagine What's Out There </h3>
<p>Most people have had fried rice, soup dumplings &amp; 
dim sum before, but imagine all of the great Chinese food that's still 
out there. It's like coming to the US and being introduced to pizza, hot
 dogs and tacos, which are delicious, but really just scratch the 
surface of American food. Think about all the great regional styles of 
American BBQ, amazing Cajun food from the South or seasonal American 
cuisine from across the country. With your support, I'll uncover the 
great Chinese cuisine we could only imagine and:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Share the best dishes I discover with you.</li>
<li>Let you in on the secret of where to dine across China and its major cities.</li>
<li>Who knows, maybe even open a restaurant featuring the food I discover.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>My Journey &amp; What You'll See Along the Way<br/>
</h3> <ul> <li>My journey involves backpacking across <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">17 different regions</span> in China for <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">one year</span>, where I'll visit restaurants &amp; eateries (from hole in the wall to fine dining), meet chefs and venture into local people's homes to uncover and document great food in each region that I visit. <br/>
</li>
<li>I'm looking to raise <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$24,000</span> for this one year project to not only cover basic living costs, but also the cost of transportation and research across the 17 regions. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Below are the 17 regions that I plan to cover, spending roughly 2-3 weeks in each:  </span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A Day in the Life: </span>While this should be a fun trip, this will by no means be a vacation (vacation for me is kicking it somewhere and just living with minimal planning). This trip involves a considerable amount of pre-planning, reaching out to local restaurants/chefs and recruiting homecooks/scouting locations ahead of time. From the trip's start in Shanghai, each day will involve documenting a different dish, such as the soup dumpling and determining what constitutes a ""xiao long bao"" versus a ""tang bao"", whether that's distinguished by the thickness of the skin, proportion of liquid or traditionally held principles. <br/>

Hey, that's me! I've been obsessed with food & restaurants nearly my entire life (28 years so far). It was a trip early on to Paris that really sparked my love for the culinary world. My pursuits have taken me everywhere from staging at Le Cirque in NYC during high school to putting my own spin on crepes at Cafe Demitasse in LA. 
After college, I trained with a Michelin-level Tea Mastress in Taipei/Hangzhou and later went on to stage at The Spice Table in LA while in cooking school. From there, I took my knowledge of Southeast Asian flavors to Chipotle's Shophouse concept in DC. It was there that I really got to immerse myself in ""Wok Cooking"" and develop a passion for the craft as I managed operations for their Georgetown (DC) restaurant. 
Most recently, I headed up marketing for Aurify Brands' restaurants. I love to cook. But the goal is to become a great restaurateur one day. 

Imagine What's Out There 
Most people have had fried rice, soup dumplings & 
dim sum before, but imagine all of the great Chinese food that's still 
out there. It's like coming to the US and being introduced to pizza, hot
 dogs and tacos, which are delicious, but really just scratch the 
surface of American food. Think about all the great regional styles of 
American BBQ, amazing Cajun food from the South or seasonal American 
cuisine from across the country. With your support, I'll uncover the 
great Chinese cuisine we could only imagine and:  

Share the best dishes I discover with you.
Let you in on the secret of where to dine across China and its major cities.
Who knows, maybe even open a restaurant featuring the food I discover.

  My Journey & What You'll See Along the Way
  My journey involves backpacking across 17 different regions in China for one year, where I'll visit restaurants & eateries (from hole in the wall to fine dining), meet chefs and venture into local people's homes to uncover and document great food in each region that I visit. 

I'm looking to raise $24,000 for this one year project to not only cover basic living costs, but also the cost of transportation and research across the 17 regions. Below are the 17 regions that I plan to cover, spending roughly 2-3 weeks in each:  


A Day in the Life: While this should be a fun trip, this will by no means be a vacation (vacation for me is kicking it somewhere and just living with minimal planning). This trip involves a considerable amount of pre-planning, reaching out to local restaurants/chefs and recruiting homecooks/scouting locations ahead of time. From the trip's start in Shanghai, each day will involve documenting a different dish, such as the soup dumpling and determining what constitutes a ""xiao long bao"" versus a ""tang bao"", whether that's distinguished by the thickness of the skin, proportion of liquid or traditionally held principles. 






  Perks
 Who doesn't like perks? I'll bring back my favorite finds & create experiences from my imagination:  Cocktail Menu from a Previous Speakeasy Event:
 Concept & Cocktails by Yours Truly, Design by the talented Tatum Lau.

The Co-op has been connecting local producers and customers and facilitating educational programs for more than twenty years. This is more than a food store -- it is a community center. The Co-op has recently been declining in revenue due to internal and external factors such as competition from other grocers, road construction that has discouraged shoppers, and for a time, a lack of budget and permanent general manager at the store.
This has pushed the Co-op into severe debt. But despite these very real struggles, we are confident that all of us working together can make the St. J. Food Co-op the place we have always envisioned.
A change in management and business strategy has taken place that will allow the Co-op to once again become competitive in the local economy. But in order to realize our vision, the Co-op must rise out of these financial straits. The Co-op is now at the point of closing its doors. As the result of consultation at a  general member/staff/board meeting, it was determined we must raise $10,000 for the Co-op to restock the store and reduce the debt enough that the new business model can be put in place to revitalize this vital community asset. 
We, the concerned members of the St. J. Food Co-op, have put together this crowd funding campaign in the hope of raising these funds to revitalize a Cooperative that means so much to the town of St. Johnsbury.    What We Need & What You Get We are looking to raise $10,000 in order to help restock the Co-op and put into place the Co-op's business plan and repayment of debt. This crowdfunding campaign is only one part of a larger fundraising plan that will continue for the months to come until the Co-op is out of the red. However, these long term plans will be impossible without this initial boost.
First and foremost, the return for donating to this campaign is knowing that every dollar will go towards stimulating a local, intentional small business that has served the community for many years and helped support the livelihoods of Co-op staff and the local farmers and producers who stock the store.
In return for your generosity, we are offering small shout-outs in thanks on social networks and in the store, personalized letters of thanks from the Co-op board, and even a membership to the store. For larger donations, we will send you some healthy, local Co-op goodies!

    Risks & Challenges As with all businesses, the Co-op is not immune to the tide of the economy. While this campaign will hugely support the continued existence of the store, it cannot guarantee its long term success. However, with this immediate input of capital, future fundraising and the new business plan will be made possible, allowing the Co-op to thrive.
    Other Ways You Can Help Although donations are the most direct way of supporting the continued existence of the Co-op, this is not the only way you can help. Shopping in the Co-op, located at  409 Portland St, St. Johnsbury, VT 05819, is an equally huge help. And, of course, spreading the word to family and friends by social media and word of mouth is always appreciated!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<div>But every week we hear the same thing from you: <b>three hours once a week in the summer just isn't enough</b>. You want access to our healthy farm products in a way that is more convenient to your busy schedules. You also want to get that some warm feeling of community whenever you need to feel good, not just on Thursday nights. </div>
<p>We have heard your pleas, which is why in the fall of 2015 we are opening a retail location for the Market on Main. But we can't do it without your help! Read on to find out how you can support our vision for a new space in Somerset to get the products you want when you want them. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our vision for a retail space extends beyond just what our farms offer to include other unique offerings of Kentucky farms and artists, as well as natural and fair trade items to help round out the mix. We have leased over 2,000 square feet of retail space to be sure we have plenty of room for plenty of food as well as space for workshops, classes, and maybe even the occasional live music from talented local musicians. </p>
<p>We have so many ideas for making a space that promotes healthy food and a strong feeling of community and we are willing to do the work, but we can't do it alone. We need some startup cash to help make this dream a reality. In return, we will offer you the same level of innovation and dedication that earned the Market on Main a business of the year award from the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce in 2014 and our founder, Jamie Aramini, a Crave Civic Agriculture Award for local food advocacy. Plus, we've also come up with some fun perks in exchange for your support!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>We are asking for $15,000 to help complete our goal of opening a retail location. </div><div>Here is a breakdown of where that will go:</div><div>
<p>Indiegogo Fees $750</p>
<p>Credit Card Processing $500</p>

</div></div>","The Market on Main began in 2013 with the idea that the people of Somerset, Kentucky were ready for a vibrant, diverse community market that gave local farmers and artisans a viable outlet for their wares. The project was embraced with open arms and an overwhelming amount of love and support. We have deeply loved being a part of this community and sharing our passion for local food and creative people with the people of Somerset. You have loved us back by showing up every week of the season—rain or shine—and shopping with our vendors, listening to our music, and sharing your lives with us. 

But every week we hear the same thing from you: three hours once a week in the summer just isn't enough. You want access to our healthy farm products in a way that is more convenient to your busy schedules. You also want to get that some warm feeling of community whenever you need to feel good, not just on Thursday nights. 
We have heard your pleas, which is why in the fall of 2015 we are opening a retail location for the Market on Main. But we can't do it without your help! Read on to find out how you can support our vision for a new space in Somerset to get the products you want when you want them.    What We Need & What You Get Our vision for a retail space extends beyond just what our farms offer to include other unique offerings of Kentucky farms and artists, as well as natural and fair trade items to help round out the mix. We have leased over 2,000 square feet of retail space to be sure we have plenty of room for plenty of food as well as space for workshops, classes, and maybe even the occasional live music from talented local musicians. 
We have so many ideas for making a space that promotes healthy food and a strong feeling of community and we are willing to do the work, but we can't do it alone. We need some startup cash to help make this dream a reality. In return, we will offer you the same level of innovation and dedication that earned the Market on Main a business of the year award from the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce in 2014 and our founder, Jamie Aramini, a Crave Civic Agriculture Award for local food advocacy. Plus, we've also come up with some fun perks in exchange for your support!

The BudgetWe are asking for $15,000 to help complete our goal of opening a retail location. Here is a breakdown of where that will go:
Indiegogo Fees $750
Credit Card Processing $500
Reward Fulfillment $3,000
Building Improvements/Repairs $4,000
POS System  $1,200
Display Shelving and Bulk Bins $3,500
Misc. Startup Costs $2,050
This amount only represents a part of our startup costs (such as licenses, permits, leasing, refrigeration, getting the existing walk-in back in working order, and staff) and hopes for the space, but it will go a long ways towards helping us realize our dream of a welcoming, beautiful, inviting space for the people of Somerset to purchase healthy, local foods.

Existing infrastructures on the land are:

A wooden yoga studio that holds up to 20 people

6 small wooden huts that sleep 2 people each
A campsite with unlimited camping.
A beautiful wooden communal kitchen & dining area
Rain catchment systems on all large structures, connecting pipes and water storage tanks.
Nature integrated, fire heated showers.
Composting toilets.
A Cottage with a kitchenette and composting toilet.
2 wooden houses with a bathroom and toilet each.
A small permaculture veggie garden.
A small dam which is the water supply for the garden.

Electrical power line from municipality.  


How we will expand the existing facilities with the raised
funds:


Fencing the property of 8 Hectare.

Sinking a borehole for fresh spring water.
Build large greenhouses to grow nutritious food and medicines.
Build a larger ceremonial space with sustainable materials and a central fire, holding 30-40 people.
Build more accommodation huts for participants.

Renovate all existing infrastructure.

Our plan of Action
We have put this project into action by setting up the purchase of the land, the Pachamama centre through an existing non-profit company.  The non-profit company (a section 21 company) enables us to expand the infrastructure on the land through further donations and crowdfunding.

The space we have found to continue this work on, is a beautiful 8 Hectare property on the border of the Knysna indigenous forest. The center establishes a base for our ever-growing community to come together to learn & explore more of sustainable, low impact living. Nixiwaka has set up similar infrastructures in the past and has an excellent blueprint for what is necessary for this space to be successful. We will apply the same organic based principles to further construction on the property, and are welcoming other experts in our circle to inspire future sustainable ideas and structures.

</div></div>","My name is Kerubo Mokaya and am part of the campaign team that is seeking to raise funds for  my church, The Living Word Foursquare Church, Satellite, Nairobi, Kenya to build a permanent place of worship for God. I started attending the church when I was in 7th grade. At this church, my foundation in Christianity developed and my father got completely redeemed. It has also continued to build strong testimonies to many people in the community who are getting saved and turning to God. 
Although this church is in a humble neighborhood in Nairobi, they consistently support each other through different aspects of life. Before I came to attend the University of Pennsylvania in the summer of 2011, they came together and raised some funds that went towards my pocket money.


The Church History: 

The church was planted in Satellite in the year 2004 under a tree with only 5 members. This was motivated by the pastor’s revelation of preaching the gospel into the area due to high incidences of criminal activities, drunkenness, immorality and rising number of street children among other reasons. 

The church continued to grow and by the year 2005, it was blessed with a rented building in a nearby school. However, in 2008, the school was undergoing an expansion and the church Lease agreement was terminated by the end of that year. In 2009, the church leased a piece of land and constructed a temporary building which has been a place of worship for God since then. 
The Church Leadership: 
The church is under Foursquare Gospel Mission in Kenya with the following Leadership:



Bishop Joseph Ondicho Michieka- Foursquare Gospel Mission in Kenya. 


Pastor Philip Nyabuto Ondima- The Living Word Foursquare Gospel Satellite Church


The Church Board comprising of 5 members namely the Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer, Head of Deacons, and youth patron and; 


Development committee spearheading the fundraising. 


The pastor provides leadership to the church congregation and is responsible to the church board. Church funds are also kept in a bank account with clear signing mandates as agreed by the church Board.
To reach the unreached, the church is organized into vibrant ministries for men, women, youth, Sunday school, evangelism and hospitality which are coordinated by various heads responsible to the church pastor.
Vision:
To present Jesus Christ to every person in every culture and every nation.
Mission
We are a Great Commission movement transforming communities through the multiplication of disciples, leaders, churches and movements.

<blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">New York was on stage. The collection of
bodies, of all different colors, the deepest black to pale white under blond
hair, all glowed with radiance in the stage lighting. There was simplicity to
the choreography, the lighting and backdrops, and it made me think of a New York
distilled; not as a huge, busy, intimidating metropolis but as an accumulation
of neighborhoods, resilient and intimate like small towns, and of the
relationships playing out everyday on those streets where time seems to stretch
both ways.</span></blockquote>

Todd Dickerson’s op-ed piece about Nestle's plan to bottle 100 million gallons of water a year from Oxbow Springs perfectly illustrates the kind of subjective honesty we value.</span></p>
<blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The basalt spring water in question, which Nestlé is solely interested in pursuing, is the property of the residents of the State of Oregon, not of the City of Cascade Locks. A trade deal doesn’t change that, but it works around it. What happens to that water is the business of every voter within the state; all citizens of this state are the stewards of that water. If this deal was a good one for Oregon, then why the need to “narrow the scope,” and engage in this kind of obfuscation?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-style: normal;"">Everything from trapping the ball, to corner kicks, to simple passing was on a level of precision and repetition that was second nature. The spectacles of play these girls could do were awesome to watch. In one scrimmage, a perfect  cross landed on the foot of a player named Melissa and she did a bicycle kick in the goal box. She didn’t score but I had never seen that seriously attempted by a teammate of mine. We used to joke as teenagers after practice and flop around trying to do it, but it probably looked more like we were imitating cartoon characters slipping on banana peels. All the women thought Melissa’s go at it was cool too, and she got some praise in the form of “oohs” and “aahs” but I reacted like we should stop the game and see if there was a clip of this we could send to ESPN.</span></blockquote>

Jen Scholten's photography has drawn the praise of readers and performers alike, helping to establish the inclusion of photo sets as an integral part of our coverage. Below is Kat MacMillan at this Summer's Improvisation Summit of Portland presented by the Creative Music Guild.


Kathleen Dolan holds the most viewed article and continuously impresses readers with her heartfelt yet journalistically accurate stories. Here is an excerpt from Dance Theatre of Harlem, last April at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. 
New York was on stage. The collection of
bodies, of all different colors, the deepest black to pale white under blond
hair, all glowed with radiance in the stage lighting. There was simplicity to
the choreography, the lighting and backdrops, and it made me think of a New York
distilled; not as a huge, busy, intimidating metropolis but as an accumulation
of neighborhoods, resilient and intimate like small towns, and of the
relationships playing out everyday on those streets where time seems to stretch
both ways.

From The Spirit of Harlem Shines in Portland, April 2015

Estevan Munoz's obsession with Paul Thomas Anderson is revealed with a preview article for the Northwest Film Center's festival devoted to one of America's youngest film legends.

In retrospect, I don’t know what’s more bizarre and unsettling: the character of Freddie Quell or my inexplicable need to act like a character like Freddie Quell. I walked around the hallways of my high-school senior year imitating a man with a jagged back posture, chemical-death-booze on his breath, a slurred mumble, and a face that suggested the victim of a thousand strokes.


From Obsession with The Master, July 2015



Sean Ongley's Horizon at End Times podcast covers a lot of ground as he interviews artists and innovators while grappling with the topics of the day. Sean also produces live music and comedy pieces for the magazine. Below are a few examples that express the range of audio content that we publish.



We have been ramping up our journalistic rigor in the editorial department, and would like to cover more regional news. Todd Dickerson’s op-ed piece about Nestle's plan to bottle 100 million gallons of water a year from Oxbow Springs perfectly illustrates the kind of subjective honesty we value.
The basalt spring water in question, which Nestlé is solely interested in pursuing, is the property of the residents of the State of Oregon, not of the City of Cascade Locks. A trade deal doesn’t change that, but it works around it. What happens to that water is the business of every voter within the state; all citizens of this state are the stewards of that water. If this deal was a good one for Oregon, then why the need to “narrow the scope,” and engage in this kind of obfuscation?

From Nestling in with Cascade Locks City Administrators, May 2015

Kathleen Dolan did something special by embedding in a National Women's Soccer League championship team, the Portland Thorns, during open tryouts. A youth athlete herself, she managed to hold her own and reveal an experience shared with sixty-two others. Her story is the most viewed post on Thru Magazine.
Everything from trapping the ball, to corner kicks, to simple passing was on a level of precision and repetition that was second nature. The spectacles of play these girls could do were awesome to watch. In one scrimmage, a perfect  cross landed on the foot of a player named Melissa and she did a bicycle kick in the goal box. She didn’t score but I had never seen that seriously attempted by a teammate of mine. We used to joke as teenagers after practice and flop around trying to do it, but it probably looked more like we were imitating cartoon characters slipping on banana peels. All the women thought Melissa’s go at it was cool too, and she got some praise in the form of “oohs” and “aahs” but I reacted like we should stop the game and see if there was a clip of this we could send to ESPN.

We offer all of our own surplus food to soup kitchens and food banks in an extended bid to put an end to hunger in our local area. We want to change the way people think about food. We want to show people that the vast majority of food many of us throw away, is in fact perfectly safe and criminal to just waste. <br/><br/>Where do you come in?<br/>We're raising funds to purchase some necessary commercial kitchen appliances for our cafe. We need a fridge, a freezer and dishwasher; all commercial and second hand, but all very necessary for the running of this community cafe. We also need smaller utensils, and should we not reach our full target - we will use all that we have to make sure we have some of those basics so please help with anything you can spare.<br/><br/>Why is this important?<br/>Almost 50% of the total amount of food thrown away in the UK comes from our homes. We throw away 7 million tonnes of food and drink from our homes every year in the UK, and more than half of this is food and drink we could have eaten - mind boggling, I know!<br/><br/>Wasting this food costs the average household £470 a year, rising to £700 for a family with children, the equivalent of around £60 a month. Can we really afford this? If we all stop wasting food that could have been eaten, the benefit to the planet would be the equivalent of taking 1 in 4 cars off the road!<br/><br/>Figures combining data from Asda, the Co-operative Food, M&amp;S, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose - making up 87.3% of the UK grocery market reveal that, of the estimated 15 million tonnes of food thrown away in the UK each year, 200,000 tonnes comes from these retailers, while more than half is generated in the home. <br/><br/>We want to be part of a revolution - a food revolution.

We offer all of our own surplus food to soup kitchens and food banks in an extended bid to put an end to hunger in our local area. We want to change the way people think about food. We want to show people that the vast majority of food many of us throw away, is in fact perfectly safe and criminal to just waste. Where do you come in?We're raising funds to purchase some necessary commercial kitchen appliances for our cafe. We need a fridge, a freezer and dishwasher; all commercial and second hand, but all very necessary for the running of this community cafe. We also need smaller utensils, and should we not reach our full target - we will use all that we have to make sure we have some of those basics so please help with anything you can spare.Why is this important?Almost 50% of the total amount of food thrown away in the UK comes from our homes. We throw away 7 million tonnes of food and drink from our homes every year in the UK, and more than half of this is food and drink we could have eaten - mind boggling, I know!Wasting this food costs the average household £470 a year, rising to £700 for a family with children, the equivalent of around £60 a month. Can we really afford this? If we all stop wasting food that could have been eaten, the benefit to the planet would be the equivalent of taking 1 in 4 cars off the road!Figures combining data from Asda, the Co-operative Food, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose - making up 87.3% of the UK grocery market reveal that, of the estimated 15 million tonnes of food thrown away in the UK each year, 200,000 tonnes comes from these retailers, while more than half is generated in the home. We want to be part of a revolution - a food revolution. We want to stop food making it to landfill and we want to show people how we call all make small changes that make a big difference.There are many other ways you can help support us, even if you don't have a dime to spare - we totally understand this may not be an option for everybody, so please find us on facebook and perhaps just help spread the word.

<p><b>Victim
of Hurricane Sandy October, 2012</b></p>
<p>""In October of 2012, the entire first floor of my house, some

Hurricane Sandy. As my house and all my personal belongings were being
literally washed away, it felt as if my life was as well.  </p>
<p>As hard as it was cleaning up what remained
of my house, my personal possessions and finding some of my washed up belongings
literally blocks away, I would have never thought the process that would come
next would be so incredibly stressful and time consuming. </p>
<p>The entire process was so
overwhelming. Finding a place to live, cleaning up, would all pale in
comparison to having to report all my loses to my insurance company and attempt
to recoup what took a decade to build. I literally did not know where to start
and immediately started to panic, feeling totally unprepared. </p>
<p>On top of all the
things taking place, I now had to attempt to re-stock what seemed like my
entire life. Having the tool or technology you described would have made the
process a million times easier. Something as simple as you described would have
helped me provide a complete and accurate inventory to my insurance company. To
this day, almost three years later I still remember things I lost and failed to
put on my inventory list. </p>

<p>Yonne is an 82 year old senior citizen that suffered a major fire to
her home and belongings in April of 2011. When asking her about her experience
with the insurance company [The Hartford] she mentioned “they helped me
wonderfully with the building damage and put me in a comfortable temporary
apartment until the repairs were done.” However when asking her how the
personal property claim went, she volunteered, 
“Well that was really complicated and at my age it was not easy to
recall items that burned beyond recognition. </p>
<p>""I was only given some paper
and told to write down everything I had that was lost in the fire, and it took
over a year to do as I first wrote the items down and then put them onto to a
computer using Word.”  </p>
<p>""When asking
whether she thought it would have been beneficial to have used a technology [or
product] to assist her in the reconstructing of her inventory, she said
overwhelmingly “Well--YES!” “Having a program with prompts for items that could
be found in my home, room by room would have helped me remember what was lost,
and would have been a great time saver and much less stressful for me.""</p>
<p>""I am
convinced that the fire and all the work it forced me to do, took its toll on me
and made me weaker. I am very glad to hear that there is help out there for
someone like me who had to do it all. I just hope no one ever has to experience
what I did.”</p>

<p><b>St.

<p>Janice suffered a total loss to their home and all of the personal
belongings, in a June 2014 fire. 
""One of the most difficult things I've ever done was looking at the
pile of ash and chimney brick with the realization that it was all that was
left of our home and everything in it.  </p>
<p>The shock of thinking about all that was lost
was emotionally painful.  And then I was
faced with another layer of pain—having to look at a blank spreadsheet and
build a list from memory of all of the personal belongings within the home
which had been lost. Having an automated program or software with pop up items
reminding me what I could have had in my a home in a room by room manner would
have greatly helped me remember what was lost, and would easily saved an
uncountable amount of time let alone the stress it would have saved me and my
family.  </p>
<p>What a help it would have been
to have such a software tool!  I'm sure
with this kind of program, our completed list would have been more accurate
than just what our memory provided during that very difficult time.""</p>

<p>As a founding member and spokesperson for SMV, Steve Dockins is keenly
focused on technology and products that help people. Having had friends and
family suffer losses of all kinds living in California such as mass fires etc.
he has seen firsthand how the process of reconstructing a personal property
list is both burdensome and time consuming, usually with most people never
remembering everything they lost. </p>
<p>Simply put they found there was nothing in the technological world that
could help people who did not previously have a list of their belongings
reconstruct one. Therefore he, and Ray Thibault, another experienced expert in
computer coding etc. in combination with others who were former adjusters for
insurance companies etc., decided to put together a program to help people do
just that. It is hoped this technology will fill a void and help people and
also create and support jobs needed to support such an undertaking.</p>

Tucson
Arizona
Yonne is an 82 year old senior citizen that suffered a major fire to
her home and belongings in April of 2011. When asking her about her experience
with the insurance company [The Hartford] she mentioned “they helped me
wonderfully with the building damage and put me in a comfortable temporary
apartment until the repairs were done.” However when asking her how the
personal property claim went, she volunteered, 
“Well that was really complicated and at my age it was not easy to
recall items that burned beyond recognition. 
""I was only given some paper
and told to write down everything I had that was lost in the fire, and it took
over a year to do as I first wrote the items down and then put them onto to a
computer using Word.”  
""When asking
whether she thought it would have been beneficial to have used a technology [or
product] to assist her in the reconstructing of her inventory, she said
overwhelmingly “Well--YES!” “Having a program with prompts for items that could
be found in my home, room by room would have helped me remember what was lost,
and would have been a great time saver and much less stressful for me.""
""I am
convinced that the fire and all the work it forced me to do, took its toll on me
and made me weaker. I am very glad to hear that there is help out there for
someone like me who had to do it all. I just hope no one ever has to experience
what I did.”

St.
Louis, MO
Janice suffered a total loss to their home and all of the personal
belongings, in a June 2014 fire. 
""One of the most difficult things I've ever done was looking at the
pile of ash and chimney brick with the realization that it was all that was
left of our home and everything in it.  
The shock of thinking about all that was lost
was emotionally painful.  And then I was
faced with another layer of pain—having to look at a blank spreadsheet and
build a list from memory of all of the personal belongings within the home
which had been lost. Having an automated program or software with pop up items
reminding me what I could have had in my a home in a room by room manner would
have greatly helped me remember what was lost, and would easily saved an
uncountable amount of time let alone the stress it would have saved me and my
family.  
What a help it would have been
to have such a software tool!  I'm sure
with this kind of program, our completed list would have been more accurate
than just what our memory provided during that very difficult time.""

As a founding member and spokesperson for SMV, Steve Dockins is keenly
focused on technology and products that help people. Having had friends and
family suffer losses of all kinds living in California such as mass fires etc.
he has seen firsthand how the process of reconstructing a personal property
list is both burdensome and time consuming, usually with most people never
remembering everything they lost. 
Simply put they found there was nothing in the technological world that
could help people who did not previously have a list of their belongings
reconstruct one. Therefore he, and Ray Thibault, another experienced expert in
computer coding etc. in combination with others who were former adjusters for
insurance companies etc., decided to put together a program to help people do
just that. It is hoped this technology will fill a void and help people and
also create and support jobs needed to support such an undertaking.

We are also seeking to influence how you envision something as simple as turning on your light switch or selecting affordable fixtures for your home and and office. And we look forward to showing you amazing ways you can utilize the world of electricity in your daily lives.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>
<b>What Sets Us Apart ?</b> </h3>
<p>• We value customer service and commit ourselves to high standards when it comes to meeting our customers expressed needs and interests.<br/><br/>• We are developing exciting new frameworks and technology to assist customers in determining their electrical needs and challenges.<br/><br/>• We are making it fun for people to get connected with our products and services.</p>
<p>• We not only work to be up on every trend in the electrical contracting industry; our larger ambition is to set new trends as well!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Tell us more about the ""Who""</b></h3>So, we're Louis Miller and Jaleel Sumter, ages 17 and 18 respectively, and first cousins of a great family of leaders and entrepreneurs. We were born and raised in the Washington metropolitan area, where we were graduated from Suitland High School. While attending Suitland, we were part of an excellent vocational program (Votech) which made us passionate about the electrical trade. After high school we decided to forgo college and went straight into gaining on-the-job training as electricians, with the eventual goal of starting our own contracting firm. We are currently working for a Fortune 500 mechanical and electrical construction company while striving to become a fun, customer-centric and innovative electrical contractor in the industry ourselves - one which is taking a totally new approach in connecting with residential and commercial customers.<br/><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Our Mission </b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our contracting firm will empower customers to experience a fun, innovative, and positive way to shop and satisfy their electrical service and product needs.

<p><b><i>What we want to
do </i></b><b></b></p>
<p>Hello!
We want to spread a little bit of Christmas magic across all homes in Armenia
and make children happy with Santa’s gifts. You as well may become a Santa this
year! With this campaign we hope to provide gifts to all children from families
in need residing in bordering communities and beyond. The value of each gift
should be approximately 10 USD.  </p>
<p><b><i>Who we are </i></b></p>
<p>Two years in a
row eli.am has been sending Christmas gifts to children from families in need
residing in bordering communities of Armenia. We have since discovered the big
world of the small dreams of those children; however with our limited resources
we could only make a few dreams come true. The heartwarming experience of
making children happy inspired our team to seek for new ways to expand our
Christmas initiative and to enable us to deliver a Christmas gift to every
child in Armenia living in a family in need. To make that happen we need
contributions from everyone - organizations, companies and individuals. Our
charity campaign will kick start with 100 gifts provided by Eli.am (our main
sponsor) and 50 gifts provided by each of our partners.  </p>
<p><b><i>Why we have come
up with this initiative</i></b></p>
<p>Pose for a second
and try to recall the most memorable and pleasant moments of your childhood. You
are sure to remember the feeling of joy when you discovered your Christmas
gift(s) under your pillow or Christmas tree and happiness of playing with those
gift(s) with your siblings and friends. Unfortunately, today 1 out of 3
children in Armenia are deprived of such joy because of poverty and
indifference of the society (37.3 % of children in Armenia live in poverty).
However, we believe that every one of us may bring joy and happiness to those
children by becoming a Santa!</p>
<p><b><i>How to contribute
 </i></b></p>
<p>To become a Santa
you can donate gifts or money on which we will buy gifts at their factory price
and deliver those to children.  </p>

ՊԱՊ» բարեգործական արշավ

Ինչ ենք ուզում անել
Ողջույն, մենք ցանկանում ենք ամանորյա հեքիաթն ուղարկել յուրաքանչյուր
երեխայի տուն և նրանց ուրախացնել Ձմեռ պապիկից սպասված նվերներով:  Ձմեռ պապիկ կարող եք դառնալ նաև դուք։  Նախաձեռնելով այս ակցիան՝ ակնկալում ենք ձեզ հետ
միասին սահմանամերձ համայնքների անապահով ընտանիքների, ինչպես նաեւ այլ խոցելի
ընտանիքների երեխաներին նվիրել 5000 դրամ (10 ԱՄՆ դոլար) արժողությամբ ամանորյա նվերներ:
Ով ենք մենք
Երկու տարի անընդմեջ eli.am-ը հեռավոր համայնքների անապահով
ընտանիքների երեխաներին մատուցում է ամանորյա փաթեթավորմամբ նվերներ։ Այս ընթացքում
մենք բացահայտեցինք մանկական փոքր երազանքների մեծ աշխարհը, բայց  մեր համեստ միջոցներով կարողացանք գունավորել միայն
աննշան մասը։ Երեխաներին հաճելիորեն ուրախացնելու այս հաջողված փորձը ոգևորեց մեր թիմին
ընդլայնել ծրագրի շրջանակները, որպեսզի գալիք Ամանորին յուրաքանչյուր երեխայի ամանորյա
նվեր ստանալու երազանքը դառնա իրականություն: Դրա համար անհրաժեշտ է մեր բոլորի՝ լինի
դա կազմակերպություն, ընկերություն կամ անհատ, սրտացավ մասնակցությունը: Բարեգործական
արշավը մեկնարկում է՝ հարյուր երեխայի համար «eli.am» խանութ-սրահի կողմից տրամադրված
նվերների պաշարով, ինչպես նաեւ գործընկերների կողմից տրամադրված 50-ական նվերներով։
Ինչու ենք նախաձեռնել
Փորձենք մտաբերել մեր մանկության ամենահիշարժան ու հաճելի պահերը։
Ակամայից վերապրում ենք այն զգացմունքները, երբ դռան հետևում, բարձի տակ կամ տոնածառի
շուրջը գտել ենք Ձմեռ պապիկի նվերներն ու դրանցով խաղացել մեր ընկերների հետ: Միևնույն
ժամանակ, տխրությամբ ենք փաստում, որ այսօր Հայաստանում բնակվող երեք մանուկներից մեկը
զրկված է այդ նվիրական զգացմունքներն ապրելու հաճույքից՝ աղքատության և հասարակության
անտարբերության պատճառով (Հայաստանում աղքատ երեխաները կազմում են բնակչության
37.3 տոկոսը` ավելին, քան մեկ երրորդը): 
Սակայն, մենք ոչ միայն պատկերացնում ու երազում ենք, այլ նաև
հավատում ենք, որ մեզնից յուրաքանչյուրը, դառնալով Ձմեռ պապ, կարող է ժպիտ ու բերկրանք
պարգևել մեր մանուկներին: 
Ինչպես

the forests. ... The Dragon breathes.  And,
in the time be'tween the breathing in and the breathing out, we may glimpse
eternities.  
 Deep within the misty forests, you approach the Door of the Ancients and a
wizened being opens the door Within ...  ©Welcome!  Sharing a love of Earth with many kindred spirits, we hope to
build a sacred space to share teachings and provide space for everyone to find offerings, books, and gifts to help celebrate Light and Life, all the while building community through inspiration and inspired teachings near Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  Having a place of peace enhances self-realization and inspiration to a higher consciousness and helps us find balance. Promoting harmony within our daily lives helps us live in a more authentic way. It builds community.Enjoy the captivating scents of aromatherapy, listen to the gentle sounds of chimes on
the wind, observe the expressive music of the stars, find the well being of health, and share in the sacred space that brings the peace to explore and find your own path. For
16 years, I cared for an aging parent and, now, it is my turn to dream. I’ve
always loved places of peace and beauty. 
And, I love rescuing animals and caring for others.
By helping others find themselves, we can make a better world by sharing knowledge and peace. We’re hoping you can help us do this. Artists and teachers will have a venue to share their gifts. Local charities will be provided a venue to help raise funds and find homes for pets and other helpful causes.
Once the space opens, we will offer the products on the website - books, incense, jewelry, tapestries, apparel, candles, crystals, feng
shui, oils, music, statuary, ... and add local offerings, like local unfiltered honey and hand made products, organic herbs, stained glass and gifts. We will offer inspirational gifts like specialized instruments, essential oils, dried herbs & flowers, and great wellness products and teas from around the world ... And, if we exceed our goal, to that we will be able to add one ... to all of these great spaces ... a music space, outdoor art, a gallery in which to present local
artists’ inspired works,  a meditation space, ...

One day she decided to develop and hone the skills of the people from her local community. And Domesticity was born.</p>
<p>She never realized how
much resistance she would encounter in the beginning, from people who knew only
of sugar farming for most of their lives to teaching them another way of
living,. Before speaking to her community, Mariel made sure she spoke to people
who have been in the business a long time.</p>
<p>She sought the help of
the Cottage Industry Technology Center of the Philippines. Through CITC,
instructors were sent to the farm in San Carlos City, to train those with the
skills to develop Domesticity’s products. </p><p>Through her experience, she realized that her main goal was not only to start a business, but to change the mentality of the people living on the sugar farm. One of her most challenging issues she encountered was looking for people with the right attitude to employ for the business. And in the last 13 years, she is proud to say that they have 20 loyal employees who have helped in building Domesticity as a legitimate company that sells PROUDLY-FILIPINO made and export quality products.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><br/></p>

Wineverse’s commitment to customers is to offer the finest Italian wines, the best prices, convenient and efficient worldwide delivery (through Giorgio Gori, a DHL company, Italy’s leading wine logistics provider and among the first in the world) and information that helps customers enjoy Italian wines with confidence.
Our new website HP -  Preview



Three years ago we began with a dream: enhancing the appeal of wine, one of the most sought-after and world-renowned “Italian excellences”. In no time we realized how our dream was shared also by a great many Italian winemakers who year after year tirelessly produce consistent vintages of mouthwatering wines. Thanks to their eagerness to collaborate, we quickly became the online reference point for Italian wine enthusiasts looking for new wines to discover. Today we are ready to welcome a new challenge: assisting and guiding American wine lovers in the discovery of high-quality Italian wines. US consumers are becoming more and more wine-educated and attentive to quality and thus increasingly interested in discovering the diversity and richness of unique Italian grape varietals that can be obtained only through us.Our New Product page - Preview


We hope we were able to inebriate you with our dream :-) We need your initial support to get started. Your contribution will allow us to jump start our venture. Our promise in exchange of your trust will be to reward you with excellent Italian wines that, once tasted, you will not be able to do without.

The finest Italian wines

In Italy there are more than 265,000 wine producers. Many of them produce excellent wines at attractive prices, but do not have the commercial expertise and economic capacity to make their great wines known to the whole world. Wineverse and Luca Martini discover these great wines for you and, combining them to your taste, allow you to discover them and enjoy them comfortably in your own home. Here's an example of... taste:
Luiano, I Veroni e Villa del Cigliano, emerging Tuscan producers.


We will tailor your monthly wine assortment through a product selection wizard, calibrated by our UX experts together with our Sommeliers.

We plan to rotate our wines on a regular basis, as we are constantly discovering new talented winemakers.On our website, each wine will include a product page with video content detailing the product and how to best consume it.
US launch is scheduled for September 30, 2015.

We know we should recycle, We know the world is changing, And we know we can do something about it.

But until now, it was difficult to feel like you were making a difference and it was a hassle to recycle!
Have you ever wanted to recycle but didn't because it took up too much room?
Have you ever wanted to recycle but didn't because it was unavailable or inconvenient?



Well good news, with the EcologizerTM you will never have to experience these problems ever again!
You simply put your recyclable waste item into the EcologizerTM and let the machine do the rest.
The EcologizerTM obliterates the recyclable waste and then sorts and preps the material for reprocessing into new products.
Best of all,  users of our machine (1) no longer need to pay for a waste company to come pick up their recyclable waste and (2) are able to profit from their trash.

How Your Support Helps!

We have been working on the
EcologizerTM for over a year utilizing personal funds to get to this point. We have some individual components, CAD designs and a patent pending, all of which prove our design. We are now working hard on building our first fully functioning prototype. We need your help to finish building our prototype and to make the
EcologizerTM available to the public. 

The funds raised will be used for...

 Enhanced Design drawing costs
Prototype building costs
Production tooling and mold creation costs

Help us make the
EcologizerTM available to you and millions of others who would otherwise be unable to recycle.
                              The EcologizerTM is for businesses, apartments, homes and municipalities.  It will be available in several sizes:  ranging from smaller than a dishwasher to larger than a dumpster.  Some models will even be solar powered.

<p><b>Access to energy is the driving force behind progress at a local level in developing countries. It enables individuals to improve their socio-economic positions, bringing prosperity to communities. Rural Spark is a young and ambitious social enterprise. We seek to supply potentially 400 million Indian people with energy by offering smart technological solutions, distributed through a dynamic network of local entrepreneurial partners.</b></p>
<p>We founded Rural Spark because we believe that we can improve access to energy, even in the most remote parts of the world. About three years ago, we decided to go to India to start building and implementing tomorrow's energy solutions. We are dedicated to delivering socially relevant innovation by applying a user-centered design approach with a real focus on people.</p>
<p>With a proof of concept already delivered we, together with a large number partners, are working on a brighter future for individuals and communities that are currently without access to safe and/or clean energy. By creating sustainable energy networks in these areas, we seek to bolster these communities with better agriculture, education and healthcare capabilities.</p>

</p>
<p>Despite India being the world's 5th largest energy producer, nearly a third of its 1.2 billion population does not have access to energy. No access to electricity means no light at night to study by, cell phones cannot be charged and modern agricultural systems cannot be operated. Energy today is a base requirement for almost anything and can therefore be considered a global fundamental right. By applying a social user-centric design approach, we believe that much can be achieved for the 400 million people that are currently still without electricity in India alone. The clean, solar powered energy kits developed by Rural Spark are designed in such a way that they improve the social and economic competitiveness of these 'off-the-grid' communities. With our creative and sustainable solutions, we aim to drive forward progress in the heart of the places that stand to benefit most.</p>

<p>To start building the energy networks of the future, Rural Spark has developed the Spark Station. This solar powered micro energy plant gives local energy vendors the capacity to generate, store and trade energy. This energy can then be used for a wide range of applications. Our products will ensure that significantly greater energy mobility can be achieved. These Spark Cubes are also the first major step towards developing smart grids in rural India. These devices makes use of sustainable solar energy and are fitted with 16 USB ports that can power devices such as lights and cell phones. Our Spark Cubes also contain two 12V ports for devices that require additional power, like television sets, air conditioning devices and agricultural equipment.</p>

<p>Additionally, Spark Cubes can also be connected to the Spark Station. These stations intelligently store any unused solar energy, that can be used when there is too little or no energy available.</p>

<p>We are in the process of developing a system that allows us to communicate effectively with our customers where surplus energy is available and in turn when energy is required. This data is significant, as it allows vendors to efficiently trade energy using the Spark Cubes. This is the first step towards building smart grids in areas that are now completely isolated from electricity.</p>

<p>As a dynamic organisation of free-spirited, tech-savvy entrepreneurs, we believe in creating strong, self-sustaining communities empowered through smart solutions, modelled on the base-of-the-pyramid philosophy. Our future-proof, scalable, technically sound products give local energy suppliers the tools to set up their own micro energy plants. Offering them the potential to immediately start trading electricity in a way that directly benefits the resilience of the community in which they work.</p>

<p>Since founding the company, we have already set-up partnerships with over a 100 local energy suppliers that provide electricity to 1,500 people on a daily basis. People whose futures have been improved by access to sustainable energy. Agriculture, education, communications as well as healthcare have improved in places that were previously without electricity. If energy was available, it came from harmful and potentially life-threatening fuels like Kerosene. This is why we believe that the success of these local entrepreneurs is testimony that positive steps can be made when you invest in the potential of people and their communities.</p>

<p>We learned that respect for local cultures and ideas are paramount in doing business in developing areas. We have come to learn things about our products that we ourselves could not have envisioned. We have seen local vendors making sure that schools can power TV’s, hospitals have light to operate by and many more practical applications using our energy products. We even been told that cricket matches have been played at night using lights powered by our systems. The scope of our applications is endless and in all honesty that fills us with a great sense of pride.</p>

<p>Rural Spark was founded in 2011 by three young Dutch people, an engineer, a designer and a business developer. The team has since rapidly grown into an organisation that bridges local expertise with distinctly innovative solutions. Today, Rural Spark is set up as a limited company both in The Netherlands and in India and has people working hard in both countries to create the success we are certain it can be. The Netherlands is home to our creative specialists that are on top of all the technological advances as they happen. In India we have a scalable team of Indian professionals led by two Dutch specialists in the field, one being our founder Evan Mertens, who helps to implement our products where they matter most.</p>

<p>Whilst we have already celebrated some great successes over these last few years, we continue to raise the bar and have set ourselves the ambitious task to manufacture and distribute 10,000 new Spark Stations. Last spring, we signed MoU’s with local manufacturers and distribution organisations in India. By the beginning of 2016, we will be ready to rollout our projected 10,000 Rural Spark Energy Kits that will supply 150,000 rural households with electricity. That's access to energy for over 750,00 people. You too can play your part in helping to level the playing field for those born into less fortunate circumstances and excluded by the market. By supporting our campaign you directly contribute to the well-being and socio-economic progress of people in energy deprived areas. Team up with Rural Spark today and join us in ensuring that thousands of people have a brighter tomorrow.</p>
<p>At this point in time we require an investment of 150,000 dollars to meet our direct manufacturing and distribution needs. The local conditions are demanding, which means that the products need to be of the highest possible quality. A large proportion of your contribution will help us to set up the factory facilities to produce an initial 150 energy kits that will provide 1,500 people with electricity. Scaling up to the projected 10,000 kits then becomes easy.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435517891/cz3rvxgrw53r62k6ol5b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>300,000 dollars will allow us to achieve our goal. A proportion of these funds are dedicated to placing more kits in the field, reaching even more households, , whilst the rest goes towards sales and training on the ground, , efficiency improvements and additional services for our customers. We realise that our goals are ambitious but we are equally aware that the matter is pressing for those living without clean, reliable and sustainable energy sources. Reaching these 750.000 people is only the beginning. We would like to thank you in advance for your generous support and invite you to help us lay the foundations for a trustworthy stable smart grid, that has the potential to solve real life problems as well as improving local economic competitiveness. We would like thank you once again for your help and buying into our mission.</p>

UPDATE: iDeal made possible: click here
Access to energy is the driving force behind progress at a local level in developing countries. It enables individuals to improve their socio-economic positions, bringing prosperity to communities. Rural Spark is a young and ambitious social enterprise. We seek to supply potentially 400 million Indian people with energy by offering smart technological solutions, distributed through a dynamic network of local entrepreneurial partners.
We founded Rural Spark because we believe that we can improve access to energy, even in the most remote parts of the world. About three years ago, we decided to go to India to start building and implementing tomorrow's energy solutions. We are dedicated to delivering socially relevant innovation by applying a user-centered design approach with a real focus on people.
With a proof of concept already delivered we, together with a large number partners, are working on a brighter future for individuals and communities that are currently without access to safe and/or clean energy. By creating sustainable energy networks in these areas, we seek to bolster these communities with better agriculture, education and healthcare capabilities.


ENERGY, A GLOBAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT




Despite India being the world's 5th largest energy producer, nearly a third of its 1.2 billion population does not have access to energy. No access to electricity means no light at night to study by, cell phones cannot be charged and modern agricultural systems cannot be operated. Energy today is a base requirement for almost anything and can therefore be considered a global fundamental right. By applying a social user-centric design approach, we believe that much can be achieved for the 400 million people that are currently still without electricity in India alone. The clean, solar powered energy kits developed by Rural Spark are designed in such a way that they improve the social and economic competitiveness of these 'off-the-grid' communities. With our creative and sustainable solutions, we aim to drive forward progress in the heart of the places that stand to benefit most.

RURAL SPARK ENERGY KIT
Where demands meets supply
To start building the energy networks of the future, Rural Spark has developed the Spark Station. This solar powered micro energy plant gives local energy vendors the capacity to generate, store and trade energy. This energy can then be used for a wide range of applications. Our products will ensure that significantly greater energy mobility can be achieved. These Spark Cubes are also the first major step towards developing smart grids in rural India. These devices makes use of sustainable solar energy and are fitted with 16 USB ports that can power devices such as lights and cell phones. Our Spark Cubes also contain two 12V ports for devices that require additional power, like television sets, air conditioning devices and agricultural equipment.

Additionally, Spark Cubes can also be connected to the Spark Station. These stations intelligently store any unused solar energy, that can be used when there is too little or no energy available.

HOW THE RURAL SPARK MODEL WORKS

We are in the process of developing a system that allows us to communicate effectively with our customers where surplus energy is available and in turn when energy is required. This data is significant, as it allows vendors to efficiently trade energy using the Spark Cubes. This is the first step towards building smart grids in areas that are now completely isolated from electricity.

ACTIVATING A GROWING NETWORK
of local energy suppliers
As a dynamic organisation of free-spirited, tech-savvy entrepreneurs, we believe in creating strong, self-sustaining communities empowered through smart solutions, modelled on the base-of-the-pyramid philosophy. Our future-proof, scalable, technically sound products give local energy suppliers the tools to set up their own micro energy plants. Offering them the potential to immediately start trading electricity in a way that directly benefits the resilience of the community in which they work.

Since founding the company, we have already set-up partnerships with over a 100 local energy suppliers that provide electricity to 1,500 people on a daily basis. People whose futures have been improved by access to sustainable energy. Agriculture, education, communications as well as healthcare have improved in places that were previously without electricity. If energy was available, it came from harmful and potentially life-threatening fuels like Kerosene. This is why we believe that the success of these local entrepreneurs is testimony that positive steps can be made when you invest in the potential of people and their communities.

READ MORE ABOUT OUR PILOTS



We learned that respect for local cultures and ideas are paramount in doing business in developing areas. We have come to learn things about our products that we ourselves could not have envisioned. We have seen local vendors making sure that schools can power TV’s, hospitals have light to operate by and many more practical applications using our energy products. We even been told that cricket matches have been played at night using lights powered by our systems. The scope of our applications is endless and in all honesty that fills us with a great sense of pride.

POWER TO THE PEOPLE
Tackling the societal challenges faced by today's society demands innovation, determination and a new way of doing business, not only more socially aware but also with a greater sense of togetherness. We at Rural Spark feel that the decade ahead will not be coloured by sluggish multinationals, but by young dynamic enterprises that offer elegant solutions to complex problems.

We work from the bottom up, activating our users and collaborating with those who, like us, believe that business can be achieved for the greater good. This is why we decided to use Indiegogo to build a dedicated community of peers. We aim to create a strong global network of supporters who also believe that energy should indeed be a basic right, allowing us to make this world a better place no matter where you were born.

DUTCH INNOVATION AND LOCAL EXPERTISE
Rural Spark was founded in 2011 by three young Dutch people, an engineer, a designer and a business developer. The team has since rapidly grown into an organisation that bridges local expertise with distinctly innovative solutions. Today, Rural Spark is set up as a limited company both in The Netherlands and in India and has people working hard in both countries to create the success we are certain it can be. The Netherlands is home to our creative specialists that are on top of all the technological advances as they happen. In India we have a scalable team of Indian professionals led by two Dutch specialists in the field, one being our founder Evan Mertens, who helps to implement our products where they matter most.


""Energy inspires me. Through my research I learned that we can build smart grids if and when we enable people to share electricity and build intelligent information networks that detail exactly where energy is available. I strongly believe that with the right tools, we can build sustainable, distributed energy grids in rural India.""
	
- Evan Mertens Co-Founder, C.T.O.


""I love the possibilities that today's innovations bring, but I also realise that there is a strong need to translate our western innovations into workable solutions, that directly benefit the lives of people elsewhere.""
- Marcel van Heist Co-Founder, Design


""If we really want to make a difference in this world, we need to accept that it has to be done by creating sustainable business models based on social entrepreneurship. Rural Spark has embraced this inclusive business model, which ensures the company can continue to fulfil its obligations and potential. Revenue on all levels makes the system self-sustainable and able to constantly improve.""
	
- Harmen van Heist Co-Founder, C.E.O.

 

PARTNERSHIPS
At Rural Spark we believe in collaboration, both in India and at home. This is why we are thankful to the many partners that believe in us, as we believe in our partners in India. Our ongoing collaboration with our social, research and business partners like Triodus Bank, Stichting DOEN, BOP innovation center, TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, Afdeling Buitengewone Zaken, Royal Dutch Embassy and many others fills us with the confidence to pursue our ambitious goals. Together we believe that we can make a real difference and create a brighter future for the 400 million people in India that today are still without electricity.


WHAT'S NEXT?
Whilst we have already celebrated some great successes over these last few years, we continue to raise the bar and have set ourselves the ambitious task to manufacture and distribute 10,000 new Spark Stations. Last spring, we signed MoU’s with local manufacturers and distribution organisations in India. By the beginning of 2016, we will be ready to rollout our projected 10,000 Rural Spark Energy Kits that will supply 150,000 rural households with electricity. That's access to energy for over 750,00 people. You too can play your part in helping to level the playing field for those born into less fortunate circumstances and excluded by the market. By supporting our campaign you directly contribute to the well-being and socio-economic progress of people in energy deprived areas. Team up with Rural Spark today and join us in ensuring that thousands of people have a brighter tomorrow.
At this point in time we require an investment of 150,000 dollars to meet our direct manufacturing and distribution needs. The local conditions are demanding, which means that the products need to be of the highest possible quality. A large proportion of your contribution will help us to set up the factory facilities to produce an initial 150 energy kits that will provide 1,500 people with electricity. Scaling up to the projected 10,000 kits then becomes easy.

300,000 dollars will allow us to achieve our goal. A proportion of these funds are dedicated to placing more kits in the field, reaching even more households, , whilst the rest goes towards sales and training on the ground, , efficiency improvements and additional services for our customers. We realise that our goals are ambitious but we are equally aware that the matter is pressing for those living without clean, reliable and sustainable energy sources. Reaching these 750.000 people is only the beginning. We would like to thank you in advance for your generous support and invite you to help us lay the foundations for a trustworthy stable smart grid, that has the potential to solve real life problems as well as improving local economic competitiveness. We would like thank you once again for your help and buying into our mission.

I made a community added lots of friends in it and asked each of them to post about their passion and talents.<br/><br/>I hoped to see lots of posts, but it wasn't that easy. I came to realize that my Dutch friends are scared to post about what they are building, making, doing. Something was missing here: A sharing culture - from sharing ideas to co-creating new startups together, this only happened inside schools and not very regularly. People do school projects and get their grades and a friend told me that University students are 6% entrepreneurial. So only 6% would either start to live their own lives and the rest would work for a boss after study.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for those, the problem mainly was that they weren't conscious enough about WHO they ARE and WHAT they WOULD like to MEAN to the WORLD. A system that pushes them into a job that are currently wiped out by our emerging technologies wasn't either going to help them find success or happiness in their lives so I thought about becoming a personal coach for fellow students in finding out WHY they are here, WHAT they could mean to society and HOW to do so.<br/><br/>I started <a href=""http://articulum.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a blog</a> FOR and BY young entrepreneurs within the Netherlands, interviewed most ambitious young entrepreneurs here about their WHY and kept trendwatching with <a href=""http://fb.com/candoproductions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Can-Do Productions</a> to show people WHAT is possible with emerging technology and trends. With my own experience and those from others who joined our blog, (from interviews, visiting events, joining startup competitions) I surrounded myself with like-minded individuals. Most of them were 10-30 years older - they knew already what they wanted to fulfill in live, but most of them came to realize that after a career until at least their 30's.<br/><br/>Way to late if you ask me, because then most people start to settle, and how can you make impact in the world if you have people waiting for you at home? Well that is pretty hard if you aim internationally instead of locally.</p>
<p>I setup a young activism foundation called RUUW to create entrepreneurship in my own town. Our first event attracted 160 individuals between 15-35 and we are currently setting up 3-4 events a year to create community entrepreneurship to brand the local environment and keep young ambitious people here to organise awesome things together.</p>
<p>I became the <a href=""https://medium.com/@robertvhoesel/where-the-new-dutch-founders-leaders-and-innovators-are-born-5ce60e1c246d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most active Young Creator</a> in the online <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/youngcreatorsgroup/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young Creators community</a> and helped out with 1000s of questions that were asked in this national young entrepreneurs community and grow the community from 500 members to 6300 nowadays.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2286076#!"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a winning essay</a> about the future of co-creation and crowdsourcing with the aim of running countries by crowdsourcing with inhabitants and got invited to <a href=""http://www.eacaeducation.eu/uploads/Papers2.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">present it</a> on the EACA/EDCOM conference. A conference where European Universities compete with each other to solve European issues with research and governmental marketing campaigns to be spread out around Europe by the European Commission.<br/><br/>I became more and more passionate about the Startup climate and got invited to start blogging for Startup Grind (the biggest Startup channel with over 215k readers). Still I had the urge to change something bigger than just helping single startups further. therefore I wrote <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/t6gz4xrvakgrkkr/ondernemersplan%20de%20maakschool.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a business plan for reforming education</a> and saw different like-minded people startup their own schools based on personalised and purpose learning. Since my school had elements in it that included businesses the law was not open for it kickstart my business plan into a real school last year so I started organising the first international <a href=""www.educationhack.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Education Hackathon</a> with a blend of (education) experts, students, webdevelopers, webdesigners and creatives, over 20 partners and sponsors were happy to help out in needs but all without asking for money, I wanted their expertise and resources where they had enough from. Last weekend I co-organised this hackathon with <a href=""http://operation.education/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Operation Education</a> - those who I have worked together with to write the business plan and help people with all the essentials to start a new school and the hackathon turned out to be a big success.</p>
<p>With solutions that can disrupt the full education industry as it is nowadays by a totally new layer of personalization:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg584GNCGTw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> BioClock personalised schedules</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZgehUL-jjc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Diagnosing ADD &amp; ADHD with an App for free</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7yqx71-HnE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Personalised extra curriculum tasks for ambitious students</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBRfwASOtTU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spotify for peer2peer reviewed learning materials</a> and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gemy7TD3i1g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">book swapping platform</a> for exchanging summaries, e-books, books and in the meantime reviewing it per chapter by lecturer and student.

<p>As we are combining these prototype solutions now with new and old schools <b>my next adventure - something I have been working on for nearly 8 month is the <a href=""https://changemakersummit.splashthat.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Changemaker Summit</a> (check it out!) </b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Where I combined changemakers knowledge around the world with the Education hackathon online via Google Hangouts I would now love to create a bond with this community that I have been working on from the start with Tara Byrne, the New York founder of the Changemakers community, currently accounting for more than 1000 changemakers around the globe mainly based in the US.</b></p>

A system that pushes them into a job that are currently wiped out by our emerging technologies wasn't either going to help them find success or happiness in their lives so I thought about becoming a personal coach for fellow students in finding out WHY they are here, WHAT they could mean to society and HOW to do so.I started a blog FOR and BY young entrepreneurs within the Netherlands, interviewed most ambitious young entrepreneurs here about their WHY and kept trendwatching with Can-Do Productions to show people WHAT is possible with emerging technology and trends. With my own experience and those from others who joined our blog, (from interviews, visiting events, joining startup competitions) I surrounded myself with like-minded individuals. Most of them were 10-30 years older - they knew already what they wanted to fulfill in live, but most of them came to realize that after a career until at least their 30's.Way to late if you ask me, because then most people start to settle, and how can you make impact in the world if you have people waiting for you at home? Well that is pretty hard if you aim internationally instead of locally.
I setup a young activism foundation called RUUW to create entrepreneurship in my own town. Our first event attracted 160 individuals between 15-35 and we are currently setting up 3-4 events a year to create community entrepreneurship to brand the local environment and keep young ambitious people here to organise awesome things together.
I became the most active Young Creator in the online Young Creators community and helped out with 1000s of questions that were asked in this national young entrepreneurs community and grow the community from 500 members to 6300 nowadays.
I wrote a winning essay about the future of co-creation and crowdsourcing with the aim of running countries by crowdsourcing with inhabitants and got invited to present it on the EACA/EDCOM conference. A conference where European Universities compete with each other to solve European issues with research and governmental marketing campaigns to be spread out around Europe by the European Commission.I became more and more passionate about the Startup climate and got invited to start blogging for Startup Grind (the biggest Startup channel with over 215k readers). Still I had the urge to change something bigger than just helping single startups further. therefore I wrote a business plan for reforming education and saw different like-minded people startup their own schools based on personalised and purpose learning. Since my school had elements in it that included businesses the law was not open for it kickstart my business plan into a real school last year so I started organising the first international Education Hackathon with a blend of (education) experts, students, webdevelopers, webdesigners and creatives, over 20 partners and sponsors were happy to help out in needs but all without asking for money, I wanted their expertise and resources where they had enough from. Last weekend I co-organised this hackathon with Operation Education - those who I have worked together with to write the business plan and help people with all the essentials to start a new school and the hackathon turned out to be a big success.
With solutions that can disrupt the full education industry as it is nowadays by a totally new layer of personalization: BioClock personalised schedules, Diagnosing ADD & ADHD with an App for free, Personalised extra curriculum tasks for ambitious students, Spotify for peer2peer reviewed learning materials and a book swapping platform for exchanging summaries, e-books, books and in the meantime reviewing it per chapter by lecturer and student. Also they found a way to end the need of Grades by changing it towards being able to put knowledge into practise.
As we are combining these prototype solutions now with new and old schools my next adventure - something I have been working on for nearly 8 month is the Changemaker Summit (check it out!) Where I combined changemakers knowledge around the world with the Education hackathon online via Google Hangouts I would now love to create a bond with this community that I have been working on from the start with Tara Byrne, the New York founder of the Changemakers community, currently accounting for more than 1000 changemakers around the globe mainly based in the US.
My only issue to do so is the cost issue, since I have organised everything without money all my life I haven't got the financial resources to buy a flight ticket and pay for the accommodation in San Francisco and therefore I ask you for your help.
Today this financial needs would cost me around 1600 euro for a flight to be in San Francisco and meetup with my fellow Under30changemakers for around a week, although prices go up every day I expect to need around 2000 euro for the flight to San Fransisco from Amsterdam and back in another ten days when the campaign is finished.

Including accommodation for 11 days (1 August - 12 August) this costs me an extra 1100 euro, looking at average prices of Airbnb housings.

This brings a total of 2000+ 1100 = 3100 euro for my trip, in which if I run short I will eat from cans and live on a bench in the park (I don't have such a high living standard).The Impact
 To sum up the impact this trip can have:  I want to change the way young people see the world and act towards tackling worlds' toughest problems, not only regionally but also internationally. I want to organize a changemaker summit afterwards and need to collect feedback from this first internationally summit to start an under 30 changemaker chapter here in Europe I will help out local non-profit entrepreneurs in San Fransisco with the hackathon part and will connect our Dutch community with the US community
Every extra money will go to the organisation of the next Changemakers summit in Europe    Risks & Challenges The only risk you have is that I get sick and have to cancel the flight and accommodation. This would result in:  Sending the money back or using it to organise elements of the Summit here in Europe See how I can promote or help out your business/problems with the skills I have taught in my experience in startup coaching.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Your share can be of immense value! Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word, and back my Thunderclap campaign to help spreading the word. The Thunderclap Campaign runs until the 10th of July just before the campaign ends, so please don't wait and support me, it just takes 5 seconds to do so :)",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b><span><span></span></span></b><b><span><span>Lowside</span></span> </b>all began with an idea for a magazine about five years ago. We realized that there were no high-quality publications that catered to the East Coast Garage-Built Motorcycle Community, so we began printing<b> <a href=""http://lowside.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lowside Magazine</a></b> to feature the custom work of the talented builders on the East Coast. The magazine really took off and now we feature custom and vintage bikes from around the world. We have subscribers across the globe and have shipped over 50,000 issues. In addition to direct sales, Lowside Magazine is sold in small bookstores, tattoo shops, motorcycle shops, and many online retailers. Through Lowside Magazine we have <span>connected with a huge</span> network of people from many walks of life who are passionate about motorcycles—all styles, makes, and models. <br/><br/>
</div>For two years we looked for a space that could be used as Lowside Magazine headquarters, but we could not find anything within our budget. Eventually we found a great space in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Remington in Baltimore City, but it was way out of our budget. That’s when the idea hit us. <i><b>Why not also open a garage that caters to the garage built and vintage bike enthusiast?</b></i> The facility we found was perfect. The space offered us a place where we could open a 2,000 square foot retail storefront as well as a 4,000 square foot garage for service work, painting and fabrication. Just behind the main shop on our campus is an 8,000 square foot warehouse. We took a major gamble and signed the lease. With all of our savings, we made extensive renovations, bought inventory and in August of 2014 we officially opened a motorcycle shop, <b><a href=""http://www.515moto.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">515 MOTO</a>.</b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434390677/qqfxgdmieddj6gjfdhr9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>The reception in the community has been great. There are no other motorcycle shops in Baltimore City that work on all makes and models of bikes, and the dealers won’t touch a bike that is over 10 years old, in fact, they are now referring their customers to us.</b>  Sales in the store are steady, and the shop is packed with bikes awaiting service. We've hired four mechanics on staff, two painters, two fabricators and two employees in the store.<br/><br/>We even have a pretty cool gallery in the shop where we display, promote and sell the work of local and international artists.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434392747/xftflwyrh5d4av3lqyad.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>Remember that 8,000 square foot warehouse we mentioned? Well, we decided to put it to good use...</b> The problem with vintage bikes is that nobody wants to work on them, so in many cases you need to figure out for yourself how to perform basic motorcycle maintenance and make repairs. In addition to tools and knowledge to do so, you also need a workspace and homes with a garage in Baltimore City are rare.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433878294/adnp7twb31qw5gw9zaby.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>We know how hard it was for us to find a garage space, and here we were faced with more space <span>than</span> we could ever use. <b>We decided to open the space up for anyone who wanted to work on their bike and created the <a href=""http://www.lowsidegarage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lowside Garage</a></b>. For a small monthly fee a member has 24/7 access to the garage and a 10’ x 10’ spot where they can store their tools and parts, can do complete builds and restorations, regular maintenance, or just share ideas and knowledge with the other garage members.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434388673/lxkcnfyjrqanr6xzadef.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>We currently have close to 50 members in the Lowside Garage, with more waiting for a spot to open up.

Three generations of one family come together every weekend to restore a '78 Triumph Bonneville. It's a <span><span>site</span></span> to behold, grandfather, father and son building something together, making memories that will last a lifetime. Next to them we have a Rastafarian building a Harley generator shovelhead trike, on the other side a business executive restoring a classic VFR 500 back to pristine condition. We have a tattoo artist who comes in late at night to chop apart his perfectly fine Sportster to make something his own, and an IT Specialist who is the first one there every Saturday morning to work on his Vintage Honda Race bikes. We have a team of engineers that share a bay as they build a Honda Café Racer, and a fire inspector that just moved out after finishing a complete tear down and restoration of a 1979 CX500.<br/><br/>There are interesting stories like that all around the garage, people from all walks of life in one place, drawn together <span><span>by</span></span> the opportunity that Lowside Garage offers. As in many cities, garage space is at a premium or <span>nonexistent</span>. That is certainly the case in Baltimore. The Lowside Garage provides a space for these stories to unfold, and in many cases saves a <span><span>junker</span></span> from the scrap yard and breathes new life into a once treasured bike.<br/><br/><b>In addition to providing <span>workspaces</span> for our members, we also offer classes to anyone that is interested. </b>We open the Lowside Garage to the community and host classes ranging from basic motorcycle maintenance, introduction to welding and carburetor repair, with more classes planned for the future.

Furthermore, we need to upgrade our current tools and workstations and expand our inventory to meet the demands of our diverse customer base.</b> Despite the many revenue streams, much of our work has been a labor of love and we need investors in order to truly get both the <b>515 Moto Shop and the Lowside Garage up and running and sustainable well into the future</b>. <br/><br/><b>So where will your money go?</b><br/>We have three areas that need improvement in order to operate a profitable small business and live the American Dream.<br/><br/><ol>
<li>
<b>To Truly make the Lowside Garage a Community Garage we need to make some major improvements.</b> The Lowside Garage is not a profit center, we sponsor it as a way to give back to the community of riders where guys and girls, young and old can do something that for many seems unreachable, build their own bike. Restore that rusty old clunker that’s been in your dad’s shed for as long as you can remember or build that chopper you have dreamed of since the first time you saw Easy Rider. Our mechanics and fabricators routinely donate their time to help all members out, whether through a bit of advice, or actual hands on work, but we’d like to do more and need a little bit of help to truly make the Lowside Garage a place to build something awesome.<br/><ul>
<li>We need to offer improved security to our members and plan to do so through a key card access system, which can be monitored remotely, and upgraded video surveillance system. An amazing thing about the community space is that in a little over a year of operation, we have not had a single incident of theft, destruction or malice reported by any member. However, with the recent unrest in Baltimore City, we would like to ensure that anyone using the garage is in a safe environment at all times.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>It’s cold back there. It’s a warehouse after all, with cinder block walls and a concrete floor. We would like to upgrade the old oil furnace into a more efficient heating system so that members can work in a more comfortable environment through the winter months when the majority of members are working on their bikes.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>We want to open the doors to everyone and teach more classes in the garage to the local motorcycle community. To do so properly, we need to establish a classroom area and separate it from the members private spaces. We need to build walls and provide a safe environment for the students to work in. Additionally, we need to upgrade the power of the building and purchase tools and supplies for the classes such as welders, welding gear and consumables, fabrication tools such as plasma cutters, grinders, mills, lathes, finishing equipment such as respirators, exhaust fans and safety and protective gear, including face masks, ear protection, eye wash stations, explosion proof cabinets and used chemical receptacles.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>We would like to better segment each workspace into a more defined area by building knee walls throughout the complex. This will allow us to have a more controlled and organized environment as well as expand the available spaces so that members of the community may become a part of the garage.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</li>
<li> <b>In order to offer our customers the best experience in the retail shop, we will take your investment and put it right back into the motorcycle community by increasing our inventory. We believe in supporting good old American workers. There are hundreds of craftsmen in this country, creating unique motorcycle parts that we would love to carry as part of our everyday inventory.</b><br/><br/><ul>
<li>We will use your investment to purchase directly from the source and stock our showroom with American Made parts, apparel and accessories. As much as we would love to have everything in our shop come from small American Manufactures, the truth of that matter that is not entirely feasible if we want to offer an abundance of parts for all makes and models. In those instances, we will buy stock for the store from our established dealer accounts.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Once we have fully established the 515 Moto retail store, we plan to expand our offerings beyond just Baltimore and fully develop an eCommerce website to offer an alternative source for motorcycle parts on the web. Your investment will help us in this endeavor through the purchase of inventory, computers and shipping equipment.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Finally, we will need to purchase a dealer’s license and bonded insurance in order to become Baltimore’s only marketplace for vintage and used motorcycles where members and customers can buy, sell, or trade.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>With your investment we will grow the business to a sustainable level by upgrading our power and purchasing tools to increase efficiency and safety in the shop. We started with very little beyond our own private collection of tools and lifts. Though they have served us well, we need to purchase more.</b> We currently have three workstations set up for motorcycle service work, but have room to grow. And our work list demands it. We have the customers, and we have the space. We just need more resources to keep up with the demand. Your investment will allow us to set up additional work spaces by purchasing motorcycle lifts and hiring more mechanics. We also need to upgrade our electricity to three phase industrial power and purchase additional tools in order to really get our fabrication plans off the ground.<br/><br/><b>Even if you are not a motorcycle enthusiast, we hope that you can see the value of having a shop like ours in your community. We hire locals and support our community. </b>As a small business, we make every effort available to source our parts and products from the neighborhood so that as much money as possible stays within the community. When viable, we purchase hardware from the locally owned shop up the street, send our apparel orders to the local screen printer around the corner, and after a hard day of honest work, we patronize the local shops, restaurants and pubs in our neighborhood.<br/><br/>

</div></div></div>","Lowside all began with an idea for a magazine about five years ago. We realized that there were no high-quality publications that catered to the East Coast Garage-Built Motorcycle Community, so we began printing Lowside Magazine to feature the custom work of the talented builders on the East Coast. The magazine really took off and now we feature custom and vintage bikes from around the world. We have subscribers across the globe and have shipped over 50,000 issues. In addition to direct sales, Lowside Magazine is sold in small bookstores, tattoo shops, motorcycle shops, and many online retailers. Through Lowside Magazine we have connected with a huge network of people from many walks of life who are passionate about motorcycles—all styles, makes, and models. 
For two years we looked for a space that could be used as Lowside Magazine headquarters, but we could not find anything within our budget. Eventually we found a great space in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Remington in Baltimore City, but it was way out of our budget. That’s when the idea hit us. Why not also open a garage that caters to the garage built and vintage bike enthusiast? The facility we found was perfect. The space offered us a place where we could open a 2,000 square foot retail storefront as well as a 4,000 square foot garage for service work, painting and fabrication. Just behind the main shop on our campus is an 8,000 square foot warehouse. We took a major gamble and signed the lease. With all of our savings, we made extensive renovations, bought inventory and in August of 2014 we officially opened a motorcycle shop, 515 MOTO.The reception in the community has been great. There are no other motorcycle shops in Baltimore City that work on all makes and models of bikes, and the dealers won’t touch a bike that is over 10 years old, in fact, they are now referring their customers to us.  Sales in the store are steady, and the shop is packed with bikes awaiting service. We've hired four mechanics on staff, two painters, two fabricators and two employees in the store.We even have a pretty cool gallery in the shop where we display, promote and sell the work of local and international artists.Remember that 8,000 square foot warehouse we mentioned? Well, we decided to put it to good use... The problem with vintage bikes is that nobody wants to work on them, so in many cases you need to figure out for yourself how to perform basic motorcycle maintenance and make repairs. In addition to tools and knowledge to do so, you also need a workspace and homes with a garage in Baltimore City are rare.We know how hard it was for us to find a garage space, and here we were faced with more space than we could ever use. We decided to open the space up for anyone who wanted to work on their bike and created the Lowside Garage. For a small monthly fee a member has 24/7 access to the garage and a 10’ x 10’ spot where they can store their tools and parts, can do complete builds and restorations, regular maintenance, or just share ideas and knowledge with the other garage members.We currently have close to 50 members in the Lowside Garage, with more waiting for a spot to open up. Each member has their own story, their own project and each one is different. In one bay with have a generational project underway. Three generations of one family come together every weekend to restore a '78 Triumph Bonneville. It's a site to behold, grandfather, father and son building something together, making memories that will last a lifetime. Next to them we have a Rastafarian building a Harley generator shovelhead trike, on the other side a business executive restoring a classic VFR 500 back to pristine condition. We have a tattoo artist who comes in late at night to chop apart his perfectly fine Sportster to make something his own, and an IT Specialist who is the first one there every Saturday morning to work on his Vintage Honda Race bikes. We have a team of engineers that share a bay as they build a Honda Café Racer, and a fire inspector that just moved out after finishing a complete tear down and restoration of a 1979 CX500.There are interesting stories like that all around the garage, people from all walks of life in one place, drawn together by the opportunity that Lowside Garage offers. As in many cities, garage space is at a premium or nonexistent. That is certainly the case in Baltimore. The Lowside Garage provides a space for these stories to unfold, and in many cases saves a junker from the scrap yard and breathes new life into a once treasured bike.In addition to providing workspaces for our members, we also offer classes to anyone that is interested. We open the Lowside Garage to the community and host classes ranging from basic motorcycle maintenance, introduction to welding and carburetor repair, with more classes planned for the future. Our hope is to instill in people that necessary D.I.Y. attitude and understanding of the mechanics of a bike that you should have when you own a motorcycle. This endeavor started without any investors, and we are really proud of the work that we have done with very little money, but we need to make some major facility improvements and updates to better serve our members and customers. Furthermore, we need to upgrade our current tools and workstations and expand our inventory to meet the demands of our diverse customer base. Despite the many revenue streams, much of our work has been a labor of love and we need investors in order to truly get both the 515 Moto Shop and the Lowside Garage up and running and sustainable well into the future. So where will your money go?We have three areas that need improvement in order to operate a profitable small business and live the American Dream.

To Truly make the Lowside Garage a Community Garage we need to make some major improvements. The Lowside Garage is not a profit center, we sponsor it as a way to give back to the community of riders where guys and girls, young and old can do something that for many seems unreachable, build their own bike. Restore that rusty old clunker that’s been in your dad’s shed for as long as you can remember or build that chopper you have dreamed of since the first time you saw Easy Rider. Our mechanics and fabricators routinely donate their time to help all members out, whether through a bit of advice, or actual hands on work, but we’d like to do more and need a little bit of help to truly make the Lowside Garage a place to build something awesome.
We need to offer improved security to our members and plan to do so through a key card access system, which can be monitored remotely, and upgraded video surveillance system. An amazing thing about the community space is that in a little over a year of operation, we have not had a single incident of theft, destruction or malice reported by any member. However, with the recent unrest in Baltimore City, we would like to ensure that anyone using the garage is in a safe environment at all times.

It’s cold back there. It’s a warehouse after all, with cinder block walls and a concrete floor. We would like to upgrade the old oil furnace into a more efficient heating system so that members can work in a more comfortable environment through the winter months when the majority of members are working on their bikes.

We want to open the doors to everyone and teach more classes in the garage to the local motorcycle community. To do so properly, we need to establish a classroom area and separate it from the members private spaces. We need to build walls and provide a safe environment for the students to work in. Additionally, we need to upgrade the power of the building and purchase tools and supplies for the classes such as welders, welding gear and consumables, fabrication tools such as plasma cutters, grinders, mills, lathes, finishing equipment such as respirators, exhaust fans and safety and protective gear, including face masks, ear protection, eye wash stations, explosion proof cabinets and used chemical receptacles.

We would like to better segment each workspace into a more defined area by building knee walls throughout the complex. This will allow us to have a more controlled and organized environment as well as expand the available spaces so that members of the community may become a part of the garage.



 In order to offer our customers the best experience in the retail shop, we will take your investment and put it right back into the motorcycle community by increasing our inventory. We believe in supporting good old American workers. There are hundreds of craftsmen in this country, creating unique motorcycle parts that we would love to carry as part of our everyday inventory.
We will use your investment to purchase directly from the source and stock our showroom with American Made parts, apparel and accessories. As much as we would love to have everything in our shop come from small American Manufactures, the truth of that matter that is not entirely feasible if we want to offer an abundance of parts for all makes and models. In those instances, we will buy stock for the store from our established dealer accounts.

Once we have fully established the 515 Moto retail store, we plan to expand our offerings beyond just Baltimore and fully develop an eCommerce website to offer an alternative source for motorcycle parts on the web. Your investment will help us in this endeavor through the purchase of inventory, computers and shipping equipment.

Finally, we will need to purchase a dealer’s license and bonded insurance in order to become Baltimore’s only marketplace for vintage and used motorcycles where members and customers can buy, sell, or trade.




With your investment we will grow the business to a sustainable level by upgrading our power and purchasing tools to increase efficiency and safety in the shop. We started with very little beyond our own private collection of tools and lifts. Though they have served us well, we need to purchase more. We currently have three workstations set up for motorcycle service work, but have room to grow. And our work list demands it. We have the customers, and we have the space. We just need more resources to keep up with the demand. Your investment will allow us to set up additional work spaces by purchasing motorcycle lifts and hiring more mechanics. We also need to upgrade our electricity to three phase industrial power and purchase additional tools in order to really get our fabrication plans off the ground.Even if you are not a motorcycle enthusiast, we hope that you can see the value of having a shop like ours in your community. We hire locals and support our community. As a small business, we make every effort available to source our parts and products from the neighborhood so that as much money as possible stays within the community. When viable, we purchase hardware from the locally owned shop up the street, send our apparel orders to the local screen printer around the corner, and after a hard day of honest work, we patronize the local shops, restaurants and pubs in our neighborhood.






We need all the help that we can get from the Motorcycle Community. We hope that our track record of producing top notch content for our publications and performing top notch service for our customers in the Baltimore Area has demonstrated our commitment to the community that we love and are a part of. As a way of saying thanks for the amazing support over the years, we have put together some pretty cool perks to entice you help us on our journey.If we reach our goal, the name of everyone who supports our endeavor will appear printed in a future issue of Lowside Magazine and will be posted for eternity on the wall of Lowside Garage as a benefactor.


Every little bit helps. The Motorcycle Community knows that more then most. Ever run out of gas on the side of the road? Chopper broke down on the Gypsy Run? We're the kind of guys that stop and offer a hand. It's in our nature. Think of your donation as a way of ensuring that we'll always be there to stop and lend a hand. So go ahead, make a fist and gently press it to the screen. We hope to do it in person one day.

<p>So far we've been renting kitchens by the day, but their lack of storage and special equipment is really holding us back. We can't have ingredients delivered to someone else's kitchen so we have to pick them up ourselves, which takes up a lot of time that could be spent cooking sauce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We've found a place that we think will be perfect, but it needs a lot of work. With your help we plan to install a production kitchen, a shop, a storeroom and workshop.

<h3>Why should you contribute?</h3> <p>It's incredible how many strange and unnatural ingredients can be found in food these days. There is no reason for this except to make low quality products seem better. Most sauces contain Xanthan Gum to stabilise and thicken them, most packaged salt contains Ferrocyanide to stop it from clumping together, and most processed food contains refined sugar to cover the taste of low quality produce and to appeal to our natural love for all things sweet. The way we see it, don't make watery sauce in the first place that needs to be thickened and just shake the bottle if it separates, use a salt mill to grind unprocessed sea salt crystals, and take advantage of the natural sugars already present in all fruit and veg. </p>

What is Crazy Bastard Sauce?
We make hot sauce without added sugar, without chili extract, without artificial ingredients and using only the highest quality fresh ingredients. 
It's been a good year so far. We've made a lot of hot sauce. We've been stocked by over 20 retailers across Europe, reviewed and approved by some of the best chili bloggers in the business, and we've won two international awards, including a world champion title at the World Hot Sauce Awards.

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Here is how you can help</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>This entire project is currently, created, managed and run by one person with a mission to change both the way business, and to certain extent, the world operates. It is at a point where the <a href=""https://myenterpride.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">system is there and fully operational</a>. The first 200 businesses are already signed up and there is a following on the social networks and now I need help to take it to the next level.We have what's called a 'minimum desirable product' - now we want to take it to the max.<br/></p>
<p>In the short term you can help if you are a start-up, small business or freelancer and by getting involved and just by signing up. Be part of the community, create funding projects, post jobs and sell stuff. If you’re not one of these, I am sure you know someone that would be interested. Please share what is being done with them.</p>
<p>Next you can help by backing the project and get one (or more) of the rewards being offered.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Your contribution goes to</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Some might object to contributing to marketing, but for every dollar we spend on marketing brings in a potential sale and with it a 20% contribution to a worthy cause. We estimate that every dollar we spend on marketing is doubled as a contribution due to the subsequent sales. </p>
<p>For every 20.000 subscribing members we would be able to feed 25.000 children everyday and prevent them from dying of hunger. We can't get that amount of members without marketing and improving the platform's usability.<br/></p>
<p>To be self-sufficient we need a total user base of 1.500 members of which one in five would be a subscriber. Within 12 months we want to reach the first 20.000 of which 4.000 would be subscribers. We would then be able to donate $160.000. Eight times what we would like to raise with this campaign.</p>
<p>To make each dollar more effective the network needs to develop and your money will also go towards this. This will go towards creating an even better user experience and utilise the synergies that are the thinking behind the project even better.</p>
<p>Of course we need to hire in the expertise we need to do these things.  All contributions will be used with same bootstrapping mentality that has brought it this far.</p>

<h2>Company vision and culture</h2>
<p>Our vision is simple, <b>we want to be the tool every small business reaches for to fund, build and grow their business and define a business roadmap for a better world.</b></p>
<p>We want to achieve this through:</p>
<p><i>Transparency</i></p>
<p>We aim to be transparent in everything we do. Transparency builds trust, invites communication, empowers equality and instills respect. We aim to be visible, upfront about our actions, operations, and so on. Our default position is the belief that those that we deal with treat us in the same way.</p>
<p><i>Growth</i></p>
<p>We seek to be consistently growing. This is just the beginning. Both today and in the future, we set our sights on providing relevant tools for a more complete approach to business. Our goal is be an integrated part of your business process. To do that we need to constantly grow.</p>
<p><i>Profit</i></p>
<p>The lives we touch should be more profitable. Business is the most powerful influence in the world today and profit is the driver for that influence. Our business model takes a conscious approach to making a difference in the world. To make that difference we need to be profitable, for everyone.</p>
<h3>This isn’t going to be a walk in the park.</h3>
<p>No one here is kidding themselves that this is going to be a walk in the park. We have the same risks that any new business has. There is still a long way to reaching our vision and your contribution is the first very important step along the way that will help a lot to getting there.</p>

</div></div>","My Enterpride is the world’s first socially conscious business ecosystem.It's an ecosystem because it has the tools to follow your entire business process from idea, to validating your idea, getting it developed and getting it out there all in one place. A startling fact is that half of all new businesses will fail within the first 5 years. Startling because small businesses account for 50% of the global added value, provide two out of every three jobs and are more likely to adopt socially responsible practices. So if anyone has what it takes to make real global change its small business owners.It is just as shocking that 3.1 million children will die of hunger this year. Tweet: Something is broken with a world where $1.00 would feed a child for a week, yet 17.000 children die each day due to hunger. @MyEnterprideBy connecting the two, My Enterpride gives your business valuable tools to validate your ideas, get advice, fund, build, market, grow business, and make a global social impact just by using the tools. That’s because we take 20% of our earnings from subscriptions and donate them to UNICEF and World Food Programme, both recognised high impact United Nations organisations.You can also find us here:Exactly how does it workAt the heart is a forum based social network where you can get input on ideas, get advice from the community about anything related to business. This very same community can back your project with funding, help build it by offering their freelance expertise and buy your services or products. All in one place.It starts with an ideaSo you have a great business idea, but you need to know how good.In our open community groups, or pods, you can find or start discussions on almost anything business related, from idea validation, to mentoring and advice and much moreMaking it happenTurn your idea into a reality with crowdfunding. You offer rewards to and your backers pledge funds. Backers do this to get rewards.Rewards can be anything from a thanks, first access to your innovative product, to offering advertising for your backers on your website. Only your imagination limits what you offer your backers get for supporting you.Get expert helpYou will definitely need help to get your business off the ground. You'll need everything from a website to an accountant. Find the expertise you need to build and grow your business from other businesses, freelancers and more. They may even be the businesses you met in the community. Pre-launch While each tool can be used independently, it helps that the same businesses that validated, funded and offered their expertise are interested in your new product.Announce it, get your product listed in our beta-list, get input on pricing and get marketing best practice advice all before you launch.Get your first sales or get new business.Get your first sales or generate new business. Use quick, highly discounted daily deals, to sell and market your business. Create a deal on anything.We take care of letting the community know and they will let the rest of the world know.MarketplaceIf there are business related products you need or want to sell then use the eCommerce marketplace. Good business offers - without the time limit of voucher based deals.Buy and sell anything from business courses to promotional gifts and business electronics.Pay it forwardWe are all about sharing at My Enterpride. Now that you have established your business, it's time to share the experiences you made along the way, give advice, back new ideas. Everything you received along the way. Of course you can still use the tools you've used to continue to generate leads, sales and more.We give by donating 20% of what we earn to UNICEF and World Food Programme. That's because we believe that basic education and not going to bed hungry should be basic human rights.How much should does this cost a business?Here is a breakdown of our pricing, just for the sake of enlightenment we have added pricing of some potential competitors, but actually there is no site that can offer all we offer.



Here is how you can help

This entire project is currently, created, managed and run by one person with a mission to change both the way business, and to certain extent, the world operates. It is at a point where the system is there and fully operational. The first 200 businesses are already signed up and there is a following on the social networks and now I need help to take it to the next level.We have what's called a 'minimum desirable product' - now we want to take it to the max.
In the short term you can help if you are a start-up, small business or freelancer and by getting involved and just by signing up. Be part of the community, create funding projects, post jobs and sell stuff. If you’re not one of these, I am sure you know someone that would be interested. Please share what is being done with them.
Next you can help by backing the project and get one (or more) of the rewards being offered.

Your contribution goes to

Some might object to contributing to marketing, but for every dollar we spend on marketing brings in a potential sale and with it a 20% contribution to a worthy cause. We estimate that every dollar we spend on marketing is doubled as a contribution due to the subsequent sales. 
For every 20.000 subscribing members we would be able to feed 25.000 children everyday and prevent them from dying of hunger. We can't get that amount of members without marketing and improving the platform's usability.
To be self-sufficient we need a total user base of 1.500 members of which one in five would be a subscriber. Within 12 months we want to reach the first 20.000 of which 4.000 would be subscribers. We would then be able to donate $160.000. Eight times what we would like to raise with this campaign.
To make each dollar more effective the network needs to develop and your money will also go towards this. This will go towards creating an even better user experience and utilise the synergies that are the thinking behind the project even better.
Of course we need to hire in the expertise we need to do these things.  All contributions will be used with same bootstrapping mentality that has brought it this far.



Here is what you can get
A fiver gets you a virtual high five and personal thanks.
For a tenner, we’ll let the world know how awesome you are as well.
Create a daily deal or list your products for just $25 and save 50%. We are not like similar sites that take up to half of earnings in commission. We don’t take commissions. So it doesn’t get any cheaper.
Did you know that Yoda was an entrepreneur. He must have been. Get the proof with your own “Do or Do not. There is not try” poster for half a C-note.

Anyone that has a business knows that it can be really difficult to say no to new business opportunities, demanding customers and more even when you are overworked. Now you can get a good quality t-shirt so that you don’t get asked. A word of caution though , you may want to think twice about wearing it for a night on the town, or not ;-) also for $50

What about signing up and you’ll get a three month elite business subscription to help your business. Great for if you are just starting out, or want to generate new business. We’ll include a feature in our newsletter and on social media. Of course anything you create with us will also be promoted. All of this for just $200, you save $400.
Your business website is your virtual shop window. What does your shop look like? Get a logo design and website to match for half a grand, $500. We manage the whole process and find the best freelancers to get it all off the ground. We’ll even throw one month elite business subscription to help you get well on your way.
What about investing $750 in us and we will give you a 6 month elite business subscription worth $1.200, a blog article highlighting your business, monthly promotion on our social networks and listing on a special favourite business page.
Need a full business campaign package? For $1.500 and we will give you one year’s elite business subscription worth $2.400, two blog articles highlighting your business, weekly promotion on our social networks and listing on a special preferred business page that includes your logo. Finally, whilst we generally don’t advertise on the member pages we will advertise your business in these area’s where your ad will be rotated with only nine other businesses.
Company vision and culture
Our vision is simple, we want to be the tool every small business reaches for to fund, build and grow their business and define a business roadmap for a better world.
We want to achieve this through:
Transparency
We aim to be transparent in everything we do. Transparency builds trust, invites communication, empowers equality and instills respect. We aim to be visible, upfront about our actions, operations, and so on. Our default position is the belief that those that we deal with treat us in the same way.
Growth
We seek to be consistently growing. This is just the beginning. Both today and in the future, we set our sights on providing relevant tools for a more complete approach to business. Our goal is be an integrated part of your business process. To do that we need to constantly grow.
Profit
The lives we touch should be more profitable. Business is the most powerful influence in the world today and profit is the driver for that influence. Our business model takes a conscious approach to making a difference in the world. To make that difference we need to be profitable, for everyone.
This isn’t going to be a walk in the park.
No one here is kidding themselves that this is going to be a walk in the park. We have the same risks that any new business has. There is still a long way to reaching our vision and your contribution is the first very important step along the way that will help a lot to getting there.

<p><strong>Sustainable torque system technology</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Bennett Ross, CEO and founder of Ayla Group, Inc. I’m a product developer that’s researched and tested renewable products for 15 years. As the result of such hard work and research, I am very excited to share with you an amazing new product.</p>
<p>We’ve developed a technology that is designed to remove “Range Anxiety” associated with all-electric vehicles. We have a revolutionary solution that provides unlimited driving range for all-electric vehicles, without the need to recharge or refuel the vehicle.</p>
<p>Our sustainable torque system is engineered to replace all other automotive propulsion systems, including combustible engines, hybrid engines, hydrogen fuel cells, electric vehicles, and solar-powered vehicles, producing no carbon emissions, no radiation, and no other hazards to the environment. This is something completely novel, something tailor-made for people who care about sustainability and who want to face this crisis head on.</p>
<p><strong>What will the money go towards?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are turning to you, for help raising $289K. This start-up capital is going to cover the costs of manufacturing a fully functioning Electric Vehicle with Unlimited Driving Range. We at AYLA Group appreciate any and all contributions to this project, monetary and otherwise, and we thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Here is what the $289,000 will go towards.</p>

<li>Full development of the Sustainable Torque System and Retrofit</li>
<li>Primary Custom Controller Smart Software</li>
<li>Secondary Custom Controller Smart Software</li>

<li>Secondary inverter</li>
<li>Custom pump system</li>
<li>Start-up power supply</li>
<li>100kW DC Generator with advance cooling system</li>
</ol>
<p>Once completed, and to prove our technology, we will drive from coast to coast across the U.S. without refueling or recharging. We will record our excursion and provide streaming live video as to our progress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Technology - Here's how it is works</strong></p>
<p>We've develop a 5 step process to overcome range anxiety with conventional all electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Step 1 - We start with a start-up power source. The power source can range from a few different items. In this example, we used a 3,900 watt DC battery.</p>
<p>Step 2 - We use an inverter to switch the DC battery power to AC.</p>
<p>Step 3 - We added an AC motor hydraulic pump system (AC motor - 2,300 watts).</p>
<p>Step 4 - We added a transfer case to the hydraulic pump system.</p>
<p>Step 5 - We added a generator that is capable of generating enough energy to power the vehicle and the sustainable torque system (example: 100kW generator).</p>
<p>Once the generator creates energy, the start-up power source (battery) is no longer needed and is powered off (this process takes seconds to happen).</p>
<p>A carbon free, green energy loop powers the system until the desired shutdown sequence is requested.</p>

Virtually any amount of energy can be created, for virtually any application (a home, business, bus, train, etc.).  The MathThe ""Start Up"" power supply starts the system only (not needed for continuous power to the Sustainable Torque System).Example: Start Up power supply - Lithium Ion Battery, 12.0V x 325A = 3,900WThe Inverter/Converter - Inverts or converts the Start UP power supply.Electrical Switching Unit - Directs the flow of power to the units requiring power.Pump Motor - The AC (or DC) motor, pumps hydraulic fluid through the system (a pneumatic system may be used).Example: 2hp, 20 Amp, 115v (2,300 W), 1.75 gpm @ 2000 PSIHydraulic Cylinder - 6 inch bore, 2 inch stroke12.5664 sq. in. surface area (11.3392 sq.in. w/shaft), 12.5664 x 2000 PSI = 25,132.8 lbs. of lift (11.3392 x 2000 PSI = 22,678.4 lbs. of lift)Torque25,132.8 lb. x 1 ft. = 25,132.8 ft. lb.Gearbox (Transfer Case)Creates the correct RPM for items - Generator(s) or other items.GeneratorExample: 3,000 RPM - 100kW electric generator (used to power a 90kW all electric car motor and the Sustainable Torque System).Our GoalOur plan is to replace all other automotive propulsion systems, all the systems that rely on fossil fuels and natural gases. This sustainable torque system will also replace battery packs so that range anxiety is no longer an issue.Our system requires no recharging and no refueling, saving you tons of time and money. Plus, our system makes no carbon footprint, emits no radiation, produces no hazardous materials, uses no super magnets, uses no hydrogen, uses no solar panels, and creates power on demand. Totally portable, this is truly the super-powered device that the 21st century craves.  First we remove the battery pack from the all-electric vehicle. Then install our “Sustainable Torque System” power on demand platform. With our technology on-board, you have virtually an unlimited range vehicle – without the need of timely recharging or refueling....., and yes, zero emissions.The technology exist today and we are excited and ready to implement our product.We are extremely pleased with our findings, and we believe that everyone that is concerned about our planet will be equally as pleased. Other Ways You Can HelpYou can also help by sharing this campaign on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter with your friends and family.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Our aim is to have every hiker in the world want to walk El Camino de Costa Rica, or part of it, at least once in their lifetime.  As travellers pass through rural towns along the Trail, they will stop for food, supplies, lodging, and to enjoy restaurants and cafes.  These towns and villages will grow economically in response to the establishment of the trail. This slow, socially inclusive economic development of rural towns is the fundamental objective of the effort.</p>
<p>Mar a Mar, with 23 Associates, including business leaders, tourism operators, local leaders and hikers, was established as a nonprofit association in Costa Rica in November of 2016 and has a strong volunteer Board representing varied expertise and a committed Executive Director. Six team leaders implement various aspects of the organization: Route Development; Community Engagement; Institutional Engagement; Communications and Public Relations; Fundraising; and Legal and Fiscal matters. With this disciplined and committed Board and volunteer team leaders, Mar a Mar has been able to accomplish a great deal in one year.</p>
<p>Mar a Mar has succeeded in becoming known in the world of hiking in Costa Rica, has presented its work to several gubernatorial entities where the ideas were well received and has established relationships with several lodges, community leaders and cooperatives such as Coopearruco in Orosi.   We have a digital version of the route available for guides to take groups. El Camino de Costa Rica travels through public roads as well as through the indigenous people’s lands. Of the 15 towns where hikers would sleep, all but 5 already have capacity for at least 20 tourists.  One of our accomplishments in 2016 was to establish the capacity to take day hikers on the route and to date we have walked seven of the fifteen sections with groups. A major accomplishment has been the establishment of relationships with experienced tour operators who plan to start leading hikers along the route in 2017. In fact, the first hiker completed walking the Trail in February!  We have a Board treasurer and a CPA on retainer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>These are some key milestones that still need to be achieved. We can't accomplish them without your generous support!</p>
<p>In order to fund our initiative, we seek seed money of  $50,000. Under the strong leadership of the Mar a Mar Board, the seed money would contract with program managers who would work on priority projects which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work with local associations to improve and maintain the trail.</li>
<li>Work with local associations to mark the trail.</li>
<li>Implement the Mar a Mar marketing plan which includes audience identification, developing content for advertising and publicity and the best media for the various publicity messages, and developing orientation and guide materials for hikers (maps, trip preparation information, lodging and dining guides, identifying nearby attractions along the trail, safety and first aid information, etc.)</li>
<li>Continue to engage with tour operators to take tourists along the route.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Costa Rica’s GNP is driven by tourism, but rural towns do not benefit from this economic gold mine as tourists are commonly frequenting the coastal areas of Costa Rica, and neglecting the rural and indigenous areas of the country.  This trail will promote carbon neutral tourism, which is sustainable, affordable, and most importantly respects Costa Rica’s natural environment and cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Our strategy is that these projects would establish a flow of hikers and thus create a demand that would further engage the communities along the Trail.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the challenges that Mar a Mar faces in establishing El Camino de Costa Rica include unfavorable route conditions.  Some of the zones through which the trail passes have high levels of rain and ﬂooding that impact the trail and bridges. Your contribution will assist in improving and maintaining safety along the route.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A small amount of dollars will go a long way in this project to trigger entrepreneurial opportunities in rural villages</p>
<ul>
<li>$10.00 would go towards developing materials for hikers</li>
<li>$20.00 would go towards engaging local entrepreneurs</li>
<li>$30.00 would go towards marking the trail</li>
<li>$50.00 would improve infrastructure on the trial</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, you can certainly contribute in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our video and link with your friends</li>
<li>Come and hike the trail!</li>
</ul>

Six team leaders implement various aspects of the organization: Route Development; Community Engagement; Institutional Engagement; Communications and Public Relations; Fundraising; and Legal and Fiscal matters. With this disciplined and committed Board and volunteer team leaders, Mar a Mar has been able to accomplish a great deal in one year.
Mar a Mar has succeeded in becoming known in the world of hiking in Costa Rica, has presented its work to several gubernatorial entities where the ideas were well received and has established relationships with several lodges, community leaders and cooperatives such as Coopearruco in Orosi.   We have a digital version of the route available for guides to take groups. El Camino de Costa Rica travels through public roads as well as through the indigenous people’s lands. Of the 15 towns where hikers would sleep, all but 5 already have capacity for at least 20 tourists.  One of our accomplishments in 2016 was to establish the capacity to take day hikers on the route and to date we have walked seven of the fifteen sections with groups. A major accomplishment has been the establishment of relationships with experienced tour operators who plan to start leading hikers along the route in 2017. In fact, the first hiker completed walking the Trail in February!  We have a Board treasurer and a CPA on retainer.

What We Need
These are some key milestones that still need to be achieved. We can't accomplish them without your generous support!
In order to fund our initiative, we seek seed money of  $50,000. Under the strong leadership of the Mar a Mar Board, the seed money would contract with program managers who would work on priority projects which will include:

Work with local associations to improve and maintain the trail.
Work with local associations to mark the trail.
Implement the Mar a Mar marketing plan which includes audience identification, developing content for advertising and publicity and the best media for the various publicity messages, and developing orientation and guide materials for hikers (maps, trip preparation information, lodging and dining guides, identifying nearby attractions along the trail, safety and first aid information, etc.)
Continue to engage with tour operators to take tourists along the route.


The Impact
Costa Rica’s GNP is driven by tourism, but rural towns do not benefit from this economic gold mine as tourists are commonly frequenting the coastal areas of Costa Rica, and neglecting the rural and indigenous areas of the country.  This trail will promote carbon neutral tourism, which is sustainable, affordable, and most importantly respects Costa Rica’s natural environment and cultural traditions.
Our strategy is that these projects would establish a flow of hikers and thus create a demand that would further engage the communities along the Trail.

Risks & Challenges
Some of the challenges that Mar a Mar faces in establishing El Camino de Costa Rica include unfavorable route conditions.  Some of the zones through which the trail passes have high levels of rain and ﬂooding that impact the trail and bridges. Your contribution will assist in improving and maintaining safety along the route.

Ways You Can Help
A small amount of dollars will go a long way in this project to trigger entrepreneurial opportunities in rural villages

$10.00 would go towards developing materials for hikers
$20.00 would go towards engaging local entrepreneurs
$30.00 would go towards marking the trail
$50.00 would improve infrastructure on the trial

Even if you can't contribute financially, you can certainly contribute in other ways:

</h3><div> <p>We are Grandpa Steve, Steve, Anne and Runa Kirk. 62 years separates the youngest from the eldest in our multi-generational home. Together we have come to live amid a regrowing forest nestled in Capon Springs in the Cacapon Valley of West Virginia. <br/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456272893/huceesvk1peil13mmccw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 443px;""/><i>Photo by Melissa Jones</i><br/></p>
<p>I (Steve) started working in Organic food markets in 2010 and was thrust into a large Organic Grower Cooperative in Lancaster, PA selling wholesale organic produce from Amish Growers. I've worked since then, as a buyer, coordinator, purchaser, and, along with Anne, consultant to local and organic retailers and wholesalers. All the while we have been passionate foragers and lovers of the fungi and always strive to live as land-based as possible.</p>
<p>Our role as foragers started many years before with a passion for wildness and a steadfastness to embracing its intimate role in our lives. It was there, in the garbage strewn forests outside Baltimore City, that we learned to forage for morels and process our first acorns. It was there that we learned to find Oyster and Dryad's Saddle when we couldn't find morels. As we moved to different locations around the area we discovered our own secret foraging spots of abundant fungi from spring to fall. We excitedly looked for signs of spring by what we saw on the ground. Red Clover, Yarrow, Nettles, Chickweed and Dandelion frequently adorned our salads and dried in our kitchen. </p>
<p></p>

<i>Morel watercolor painting Anne made Steve <br/></i><p><i>for his birthday one year. We really LOVE fungi!</i><br/></p>
<i><br/></i>
<p>We seek to break from our role as facilitators and marketers and use our knowledge to produce the highest quality, organically grown, and robustly varied mushrooms. We seek to encourage decomposition in the overly logged forest which we now live and  help the surrounding community heal and feed while decomposing the massive amount of debris left from over cutting. <b>Our goal is to heal and nourish people and landscapes. </b><br/></p>
<p>Hexenring will create fresh and dried mushroom foods and medicines for distribution in a radiating local market. We will seek to serve our immediate community first and expand our distribution further only when needed to sustain our fungal community. We want to facilitate knowledge of mycological landscape techniques to others so we create the largest group effort to repair the forest around us. <br/></p>
<p>Our fungal production will be done indoor and outdoor in order to maintain healthy strains of our varied gourmet and medicinal selection. Our indoor production will be efficient and light in resources used. Our outdoor production will be as integrated as possible into the existing ecosystem. <b>We seek to enhance the ecology of our backyard through expanding the network of mycelium that West Virginia is famous for.</b><br/></p>
<p><b>We can't do this alone. </b>We need the help of our friends, families, and, most importantly, the local community to bring a vibrant food and essentials producer to eastern West Virginia. We will be offering a vast variety of mushrooms all grown on wild or organic substrates. We will be stewards of the spore, spawn, mycelium, and fruit bodies by perfecting sterile culture techniques and growing in a hybrid of indoor and outdoor mediums. Mushrooms include Reishi, Oyster, Shiitake, Paddy Straw, Pioppini, Lion's Mane, Turkey Tail, King Stropharia, Maitake, and more in the years to come!</p>
<p>Hexenring will host educational events, workshops, and other efforts to spread knowledge and community-sufficiency as far as we can.</p>
<i>Anne Kirk: </i>Wood products and the timber industry are still a large part of West Virginia's economy. Although coal mining is in decline, we still have mountain top removal and natural gas fracking to contend with. Any environmentally exploitative industry you can think of thrives in areas of economic hardship, and finding a job in this region extremely difficult. Currently Wal Mart is the largest employer in the state. ""West Virginia is the third most forested state in the United States. Forests cover 78.0% (12.0 millions acres) of the state’s 15.4 millions acres of land. <b>Almost all of the forested land (11.8 millions acres or 98.3 %) is classified as commercial forestland, which is available for timber production.</b>"" And ""produce"" it they have, in staggering quantities. <br/><br/>
<p><a href=""http://www.patc.us/history/archive/virg_fst.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Out
 of the 10,000,000 acres of virgin forest that existed in the State of 
West Virginia before 1750, only these 263 acres remain.""</a> <br/></p>
<p>Until recently I did not realize the vast differences between an old growth forest and a more recently regrown post logging forest like the one on our property. It's far more than just the size of the trees, though that is certainly the most striking difference when you first enter. After spending time on a road trip exploring deep within the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, we discovered the vast expanse of fungi, plants and animals that flourish in an ancestral forest. One reason for this is the staggered age of the trees all providing different habitat and food. When a forest has been clear cut (logged to literally nothing) and replanted it has not been ""replaced"". Instead a tree crop has been planted - highly uniform in age and species. Think of  a Christmas tree farm versus an actual vibrant forest. In the newly replanted forest there are no dead trees on the forest floor that the fungi feed on. The fungal mycelium suffers and beneficial decomposition comes to a halt. <br/></p>
<p>The three groups of Saprophytic Mushrooms aka The Decomposers include most of the gourmet mushrooms we intend to work with. Basically, the Primary Decomposers are first to the forest feeding party, and they grow insanely fast. They release enzymes and break down the cellulose (plant tissue) of a stump, fallen tree, compost, anything cellulose really, until they no longer can. Next enter the Secondary Decomposers who rely on the previous activity to work their magic. Last to join is the Tertiary Decomposers who really complete the cycle. All three stages of these fungi can coexist on the forest  floor within a healthy forest where there is constant replenishment of organic material.<b> And this is what makes cultivation so exciting, just because you've grown mushrooms on one growing medium (substrate) doesn't mean that material is used up, you just need to move up the ladder of decomposition.</b><br/></p>
<p>In a replanted forest the natural cycle of debris is interrupted. This causes  a huge loss of species diversity which has devastating affects. Our aim with Hexenring is to explore and utilize a wide variety mycological landscaping tactics to rehabilitate our burgeoning forest back to its previous ""wild and wonderful"" state. We will be true stewards to the land and want to cultivate a healing relationship that will encourage biodiversity in our region. <br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why Fungi? <br/>
</h3>
<p>Fungi are coming up more often in mainstream news articles as their effects as decomposers are studied on treating the current environmental crisis. As decomposers they have a unique ability to help restore polluted land which is refereed to as ""mycoremediation"", or the ability of fungi to 'degrade or sequester contaminants in the environment'  - <a href=""http://www.fungi.com/blog/items/the-petroleum-problem.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">such as an oil spill</a>. Have you seen<i> Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind?   </i>Spoiler alter - the radioactive forest was cleansed by none other than fungi, aka mycoremediation.  We want to use our ever expanding knowledge of the wild world to 
reestablish what has been lost to the wreckage of industrialism.<br/></p>We also want to reestablish wild medicine as a powerful healing tool by sharing the knowledge of edible and medicinal plants and fungi with our community. We think gourmet mushrooms taste great, but their actual healing potential is staggering and too often overlooked. Modern western culture lags behind in our exploration and knowledge of the healing benefits of mushrooms, but the health <a href=""http://www.motherearthliving.com/health-and-wellness/not-just-pretty-fungi.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">benefits are huge</a>. Recently you may have heard the rumors about certain <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nalini-chilkov/cancer-foods_b_1192207.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mushrooms killing cancer cells</a>. If you're having trouble swallowing that amazing fact, just remember that they're being used to treat OIL SPILLS too.  We plan to offer a wide variety of medicinal fungi products to support our local community, which is unfortunately considered the <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/how-coal-industry-impoverishes-west-virginia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""most
 depressed"" state in the country, amongst other distressing statistics 
regarding obesity, prescription drug abuse, and untreated mental health 
disorders </a>- something our friends back in Baltimore should find shocking. <br/><br/>As if we needed another reason to be obsessed with all mycellium offers, have you heard about <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006481"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)</a> and the fast loss of the pollinators known as honeybees? While CCD is generally accepted to be caused by an  aggregate of factors converging to lower immunity among bee colonies, the use of certain pesticides is known to be a large culprit. The well know mycologist Paul Stamets, who is a huge influence on our techniques for cultivation and mycological landscape planning, is researching the effects of mycelium on <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006481"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">saving our pollinators</a> from one of their biggest threats - the varrora mites. This is research I keep a close eye on as I hear the news of my natural beekeeping mentor <a href=""www.bmorehoney.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meme Thomas of Baltimore Honey </a>losing over 90% of her naturally kept beehives last year. We hope to explore this relationship between mycelium and pollinator's health by creating a sanctuary for honey bees and native pollinators on our land. <br/><br/>Beyond the specific and scientific there is a feeling and beauty to mycelium and its fruit bodies. The gentle primordia emerging from tiny dots in the soil. The indescribable individualism of each mushroom. And ultimately the intense fragility of each piece yet the inherent strength in structure. The magic of the mushroom runs deep and it has long been too ignored by ""foraging experts"". It is time to restore the fungi, from forest to plate. We are but a small part of the rapid renaissance of the mushroom.<br/><br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Creating Vibrant Food and Medicine Who We Are: 
 We are Grandpa Steve, Steve, Anne and Runa Kirk. 62 years separates the youngest from the eldest in our multi-generational home. Together we have come to live amid a regrowing forest nestled in Capon Springs in the Cacapon Valley of West Virginia. 

Photo by Melissa Jones
I (Steve) started working in Organic food markets in 2010 and was thrust into a large Organic Grower Cooperative in Lancaster, PA selling wholesale organic produce from Amish Growers. I've worked since then, as a buyer, coordinator, purchaser, and, along with Anne, consultant to local and organic retailers and wholesalers. All the while we have been passionate foragers and lovers of the fungi and always strive to live as land-based as possible.
Our role as foragers started many years before with a passion for wildness and a steadfastness to embracing its intimate role in our lives. It was there, in the garbage strewn forests outside Baltimore City, that we learned to forage for morels and process our first acorns. It was there that we learned to find Oyster and Dryad's Saddle when we couldn't find morels. As we moved to different locations around the area we discovered our own secret foraging spots of abundant fungi from spring to fall. We excitedly looked for signs of spring by what we saw on the ground. Red Clover, Yarrow, Nettles, Chickweed and Dandelion frequently adorned our salads and dried in our kitchen. 


Morel watercolor painting Anne made Steve for his birthday one year. We really LOVE fungi!

We seek to break from our role as facilitators and marketers and use our knowledge to produce the highest quality, organically grown, and robustly varied mushrooms. We seek to encourage decomposition in the overly logged forest which we now live and  help the surrounding community heal and feed while decomposing the massive amount of debris left from over cutting. Our goal is to heal and nourish people and landscapes. 
Hexenring will create fresh and dried mushroom foods and medicines for distribution in a radiating local market. We will seek to serve our immediate community first and expand our distribution further only when needed to sustain our fungal community. We want to facilitate knowledge of mycological landscape techniques to others so we create the largest group effort to repair the forest around us. 
Our fungal production will be done indoor and outdoor in order to maintain healthy strains of our varied gourmet and medicinal selection. Our indoor production will be efficient and light in resources used. Our outdoor production will be as integrated as possible into the existing ecosystem. We seek to enhance the ecology of our backyard through expanding the network of mycelium that West Virginia is famous for.
We can't do this alone. We need the help of our friends, families, and, most importantly, the local community to bring a vibrant food and essentials producer to eastern West Virginia. We will be offering a vast variety of mushrooms all grown on wild or organic substrates. We will be stewards of the spore, spawn, mycelium, and fruit bodies by perfecting sterile culture techniques and growing in a hybrid of indoor and outdoor mediums. Mushrooms include Reishi, Oyster, Shiitake, Paddy Straw, Pioppini, Lion's Mane, Turkey Tail, King Stropharia, Maitake, and more in the years to come!
Hexenring will host educational events, workshops, and other efforts to spread knowledge and community-sufficiency as far as we can.
Anne Kirk: Wood products and the timber industry are still a large part of West Virginia's economy. Although coal mining is in decline, we still have mountain top removal and natural gas fracking to contend with. Any environmentally exploitative industry you can think of thrives in areas of economic hardship, and finding a job in this region extremely difficult. Currently Wal Mart is the largest employer in the state. ""West Virginia is the third most forested state in the United States. Forests cover 78.0% (12.0 millions acres) of the state’s 15.4 millions acres of land. Almost all of the forested land (11.8 millions acres or 98.3 %) is classified as commercial forestland, which is available for timber production."" And ""produce"" it they have, in staggering quantities. 
""Out
 of the 10,000,000 acres of virgin forest that existed in the State of 
West Virginia before 1750, only these 263 acres remain."" 
Until recently I did not realize the vast differences between an old growth forest and a more recently regrown post logging forest like the one on our property. It's far more than just the size of the trees, though that is certainly the most striking difference when you first enter. After spending time on a road trip exploring deep within the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, we discovered the vast expanse of fungi, plants and animals that flourish in an ancestral forest. One reason for this is the staggered age of the trees all providing different habitat and food. When a forest has been clear cut (logged to literally nothing) and replanted it has not been ""replaced"". Instead a tree crop has been planted - highly uniform in age and species. Think of  a Christmas tree farm versus an actual vibrant forest. In the newly replanted forest there are no dead trees on the forest floor that the fungi feed on. The fungal mycelium suffers and beneficial decomposition comes to a halt. 
The three groups of Saprophytic Mushrooms aka The Decomposers include most of the gourmet mushrooms we intend to work with. Basically, the Primary Decomposers are first to the forest feeding party, and they grow insanely fast. They release enzymes and break down the cellulose (plant tissue) of a stump, fallen tree, compost, anything cellulose really, until they no longer can. Next enter the Secondary Decomposers who rely on the previous activity to work their magic. Last to join is the Tertiary Decomposers who really complete the cycle. All three stages of these fungi can coexist on the forest  floor within a healthy forest where there is constant replenishment of organic material. And this is what makes cultivation so exciting, just because you've grown mushrooms on one growing medium (substrate) doesn't mean that material is used up, you just need to move up the ladder of decomposition.
In a replanted forest the natural cycle of debris is interrupted. This causes  a huge loss of species diversity which has devastating affects. Our aim with Hexenring is to explore and utilize a wide variety mycological landscaping tactics to rehabilitate our burgeoning forest back to its previous ""wild and wonderful"" state. We will be true stewards to the land and want to cultivate a healing relationship that will encourage biodiversity in our region. 

Why Fungi? 

Fungi are coming up more often in mainstream news articles as their effects as decomposers are studied on treating the current environmental crisis. As decomposers they have a unique ability to help restore polluted land which is refereed to as ""mycoremediation"", or the ability of fungi to 'degrade or sequester contaminants in the environment'  - such as an oil spill. Have you seen Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind?   Spoiler alter - the radioactive forest was cleansed by none other than fungi, aka mycoremediation.  We want to use our ever expanding knowledge of the wild world to 
reestablish what has been lost to the wreckage of industrialism.We also want to reestablish wild medicine as a powerful healing tool by sharing the knowledge of edible and medicinal plants and fungi with our community. We think gourmet mushrooms taste great, but their actual healing potential is staggering and too often overlooked. Modern western culture lags behind in our exploration and knowledge of the healing benefits of mushrooms, but the health benefits are huge. Recently you may have heard the rumors about certain mushrooms killing cancer cells. If you're having trouble swallowing that amazing fact, just remember that they're being used to treat OIL SPILLS too.  We plan to offer a wide variety of medicinal fungi products to support our local community, which is unfortunately considered the ""most
 depressed"" state in the country, amongst other distressing statistics 
regarding obesity, prescription drug abuse, and untreated mental health 
disorders - something our friends back in Baltimore should find shocking. As if we needed another reason to be obsessed with all mycellium offers, have you heard about Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and the fast loss of the pollinators known as honeybees? While CCD is generally accepted to be caused by an  aggregate of factors converging to lower immunity among bee colonies, the use of certain pesticides is known to be a large culprit. The well know mycologist Paul Stamets, who is a huge influence on our techniques for cultivation and mycological landscape planning, is researching the effects of mycelium on saving our pollinators from one of their biggest threats - the varrora mites. This is research I keep a close eye on as I hear the news of my natural beekeeping mentor Meme Thomas of Baltimore Honey losing over 90% of her naturally kept beehives last year. We hope to explore this relationship between mycelium and pollinator's health by creating a sanctuary for honey bees and native pollinators on our land. Beyond the specific and scientific there is a feeling and beauty to mycelium and its fruit bodies. The gentle primordia emerging from tiny dots in the soil. The indescribable individualism of each mushroom. And ultimately the intense fragility of each piece yet the inherent strength in structure. The magic of the mushroom runs deep and it has long been too ignored by ""foraging experts"". It is time to restore the fungi, from forest to plate. We are but a small part of the rapid renaissance of the mushroom.

<p><b>Back in 2008, I made a determination to change the
way we do business in America.</b></p>
<p>I was working in operations for a well-known convenience
store chain here in the US. While the operations aspect of the business is
extremely efficient, the quality of the food and products isn’t the best.
Processed food and giant corporations rule the shelves. I didn’t question it.
It's simply how it is.</p>
<p>I traveled to Japan and noticed that the convenience
stores there are very different than what they are here in America. Everyone
goes there to get breakfast and lunch. The food is fresh and tasty. The stores
are neat and well-kept. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>It made me think, why don’t we have the same
convenience here in America?</b></p>
<p>During this time, I also came across an<b> <span></span></b><a href=""http://www.sgiquarterly.org/global2006Oct-1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>article</b> </a>that talked about how women in Africa were
being exploited to profit the coffee business. It stressed the need for more
creative ways to do business that add value for both the owners and the
clients, without sacrificing the people that supply a store's shelves.</p>
<p>At that moment, I determined, I will take on the task to create this
model. With <b>VIGOA</b>, I will completely revolutionize the food
business industry by making it accessible and truly convenient for everyone.</p>
<p>This campaign is the first step to making my determination a reality. I
have great conviction that <b>VIGOA</b> will lead the way into the
future of convenience in America. I invite you to be a part of this
revolution. </p>

(11/12/15) – VIGOA partnered with Art Nouveau Gallery in Wynwood, Miami's
Art District, to celebrate the pre-launch of VIGOA's
Indiegogo Campaign, during the gallery's most recent exhibit opening!

********
Back in 2008, I made a determination to change the
way we do business in America.
I was working in operations for a well-known convenience
store chain here in the US. While the operations aspect of the business is
extremely efficient, the quality of the food and products isn’t the best.
Processed food and giant corporations rule the shelves. I didn’t question it.
It's simply how it is.
I traveled to Japan and noticed that the convenience
stores there are very different than what they are here in America. Everyone
goes there to get breakfast and lunch. The food is fresh and tasty. The stores
are neat and well-kept. 

It made me think, why don’t we have the same
convenience here in America?
During this time, I also came across an article that talked about how women in Africa were
being exploited to profit the coffee business. It stressed the need for more
creative ways to do business that add value for both the owners and the
clients, without sacrificing the people that supply a store's shelves.
At that moment, I determined, I will take on the task to create this
model. With VIGOA, I will completely revolutionize the food
business industry by making it accessible and truly convenient for everyone.
This campaign is the first step to making my determination a reality. I
have great conviction that VIGOA will lead the way into the
future of convenience in America. I invite you to be a part of this
revolution. 
NOW IS THE TIME!

VIGOA: THE NEW ERA OF CONVENIENCE



VIGOA is a high-end convenience store
for people who want simple yet delicious food, beverage and product options
that are conveniently available anytime, at a fair price and that do not come
at the cost of their health or bad business practices.

We will roast our own coffee in-house. We will have an organic juice bar. We will bake our own bread. Our products will be
provided by an organic certified distributor. Plus, we will work with local farmers to have the best produce.

VIGOA
will offer fresh homemade food prepared daily by my partner,                    Chef
Pablo Coca Mir, a great culinary artist who brings his passion and love for food.



WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET

 

At this point, VIGOA is a
revolutionary concept. In order to make this idea a reality, your support is
crucial!
I am absolutely determined to
open our first store in 2016. To make this happen, I have set a goal of
$100,000.00. These funds will help us:

Secure the best location (aprox. 3,000 sq. ft.) in
     VIGOA’s home base of Miami, Florida ($15K) 
Construction/Remodeling Costs ($35K)
Rent the Equipment Needed to Operate Successfully

VIGOA'S IMPACT
 


VIGOA is a necessity in our
modern world.
 I've lost count of all the conversations I've had with people that
complain that there are simply no food options for healthy conscious
individuals available quickly and priced fairly. 
They also tell me how much VIGOA is needed and how much they would appreciate having a one-stop shopping store where
they can grab a deliciously healthy bite to eat as well as any item they need,
quickly at any time.
I am confident that this model will be
successful not only at a local level, but that it can be easily replicated in
any part of the country. Once we open our first store, the sky is the
limit. 
   

WHAT ARE THE RISKS?  

This is the very first step VIGOA is taking to become
a reality and not just an idea. Many people have great ideas but fail to make
them possible because they lack the operations and logistics expertise to
execute them.
I have 20+ years of experience in the area of
operations in the food and convenience store industries. I have
successfully opened 75+ stores in the US and Latin America in these categories.
I have trained the staff before opening a store and
made sure they meet the highest standards.  I have monitored the success
of the store after it opens to make sure it generates profit.
I have increased sales 300% in just 6 months by implementing innovative marketing
strategies. 
In short, I have the necessary experience, the track
record and the passion to open this business successfully and guarantee it
operates with the highest standards.

</div><h2>Welcome to Wandering Ravens!

</h2><p></p>My name is Kristen Lindtvedt and I am the founder of Wandering Ravens. What is Wandering Ravens you ask?  Well, Wandering Ravens was born from my experiences this past summer while on a 7800 mile, cross-country road trip with my Son during which we documented<a href=""http://www.thewanderingravens.com/blog.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> on our blog</a> the horrific levels of poverty and homelessness we encountered in every state we traveled to; it broke our hearts, and made us angry.<br/>​  <br/>Our experiences on the road made me realize that as a country we must turn ourselves back toward community and look for a different way to help each other; a line of thought that ultimately birthed a question in my mind which led to an idea, ""what if we could create a world in which every person struggling with poverty had the ability to make the life they wanted through other means using the corporate complex being used against us on a daily basis?”  What if, instead of the standard fast food joint and big box retailer we could create a business that didn’t put profit before all else and took greater responsibility for its own communities and committed itself not just to making a profit, but to making a difference in a sustainable way that helped people actually escape poverty and homelessness. <br/><br/>As a direct result of these experiences on the road I changed the course of my life and decided to build a company that would directly help impoverished individuals. Not a charity, but a unique socially responsible, supportive, yet real-world based gift, art and craft company that provides free access to materials, training, and retail support to impoverished individuals looking to obtain the entrepreneurial skills needed to aid in the control of their own lives and futures. And on November 23 we opened our virtual doors <a href=""http://www.thewanderingravens.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">which you can see here</a>!<div>

What I
Need to Fully Make this Dream a Reality


The first steps of the Wandering Ravens mission were established when we began documenting our experiences this past summer.  By speaking out about what we saw and experienced we began to lift the veil of secrecy poverty is too often shrouded in. 

The second step was to put the words into action through the formal establishment of Wandering Ravens ""the company"" and the establishment of our company website and online gift boutique.  I have self-funded the site, store, and core product line, as well as our first supported artist, Dorothy Walsh, who debuted as the first Wandering Ravens Featured Artist on November 23, 2015 (see her page here), but need additional funds to bring my entire dream to fruition, the creation of the physical training and studio space.

</div><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>I am Maria Del Carmen
Parra Cano, known to most as Carmen. I am married to my amazing husband Brian
and together we have two beautiful little girls, Yolehua Luna and Quizani
Texcohtli. In my two and a half years as a stay-at-home-mom, I have been able
to grow as a person and most importantly as a wife and mother. Prior to
becoming a wife and mother, I worked in the non-profit area for over 10 years. I have a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies in Non-profit
Administration &amp; Sociology. During that time, I also received an Occupational Studies in Culinary Arts  Degree from Scottsdale Culinary Institute and am currently pursuing a Masters
in Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance,</p>
<p>This past year was
difficult for our family with the unexpected passing of my mother, Maria
Cristina Parra. My mother was a tailor for over 40 years and brought her
family to Arizona from Mexico in order to sustain her family through the art of sewing. My
mother made authentic mariachi suits, outfits for ballet folklorico, wedding
dresses, quinceanera dresses, and much more. Her passing not only affected her family, but hundreds of clients and community members that
considered her a friend.</p>
<p>My mother gifted me my first ring sling which was made from Guatemalan fabric. She gave it to me prior
to the birth of my first daughter and I use it DAILY!! The tradition of using a
rebozo or a wrap to carry our little ones is one of rich history and has been
passed down from our ancestors for centuries. Being an active babywearing mom
and seeing how this tradition is such a ""trend"" within mainstream
society, I have created Indigena as a method to continue our traditions and
support women along the way.</p>
<p>In supporting women, I began a partnership with a collective of traditional weavers in San Juan La Laguna in Guatemala

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am Maria Del Carmen
Parra Cano, known to most as Carmen. I am married to my amazing husband Brian
and together we have two beautiful little girls, Yolehua Luna and Quizani
Texcohtli. In my two and a half years as a stay-at-home-mom, I have been able
to grow as a person and most importantly as a wife and mother. Prior to
becoming a wife and mother, I worked in the non-profit area for over 10 years. I have a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies in Non-profit
Administration & Sociology. During that time, I also received an Occupational Studies in Culinary Arts  Degree from Scottsdale Culinary Institute and am currently pursuing a Masters
in Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance,
This past year was
difficult for our family with the unexpected passing of my mother, Maria
Cristina Parra. My mother was a tailor for over 40 years and brought her
family to Arizona from Mexico in order to sustain her family through the art of sewing. My
mother made authentic mariachi suits, outfits for ballet folklorico, wedding
dresses, quinceanera dresses, and much more. Her passing not only affected her family, but hundreds of clients and community members that
considered her a friend.
My mother gifted me my first ring sling which was made from Guatemalan fabric. She gave it to me prior
to the birth of my first daughter and I use it DAILY!! The tradition of using a
rebozo or a wrap to carry our little ones is one of rich history and has been
passed down from our ancestors for centuries. Being an active babywearing mom
and seeing how this tradition is such a ""trend"" within mainstream
society, I have created Indigena as a method to continue our traditions and
support women along the way.
In supporting women, I began a partnership with a collective of traditional weavers in San Juan La Laguna in Guatemala
who were left to sustain their community after losing coffee crops in the area
due to a hurricane. These women use traditional back-strap looms and a treadle
foot looms. The collective is a member of the Fair Trade Federation.
At this point, my
family has already made the initial investment of purchasing some fabrics to
launch and paid membership fees to the Baby Carrier Industry Alliance. We are prepared to manufacture each item in our home. What we were not prepared for
however, is the cost of sending items off to a testing facility. Though using
these types of carriers have existed for centuries, the babywearing industry is
highly regulated by the federal government. Part of these regulations require
prototype testing prior to putting items on the market. Without testing, a
business runs a huge risk of liability, fees and prosecution. 
Assisting in this
project would make a huge impact to parents who need babywearing to assist them
in doing housework, school work or just nurturing and caring for their little
ones of all ages and backgrounds. The purchase of a wrap or ring sling would
allow for sustainable support for the collective of women in Guatemala to
not only continue their indigenous tradition of weaving but in feeding and supporting
their families.  
What We Need

At this time, our project is humbly asking for your
     support in raising $5,000. This funding would go towards the cost of
     prototype testing and certification as well as the cost of graphic design,
     photography, and the branding and packaging of our rings slings and wraps.

If we do not reach our goal in the time allowed, we
     will decrease our number of items set to launch and do the best we can with
     the funds we do receive.


Not only is our
project commemorating an amazing woman, mother and artist, this project allows
for the traditions of weaving, sewing and babywearing to continue.  

 
This project will assist my family in commemorating my
     mother as well as support an indigenous (Mexica/Izkaloteka) woman owned initiative.
There are many companies that use our images and
     culturally appropriate babywearing as their own, leaving out our
     indigenous history and traditions. Our goal is to continue educating
     mothers and families to be able to reaffirm their indigenous history as
     well as educate fathers and partners in learning how to carry their
     children like their mothers do.

Our main challenge
would be not having the funds needed to launch our line by the end of January
2016. Our family will continue to make sacrifices in order to make this project
work.

</div><h3>Breve reseña</h3><div> </div><p>Soy Hernando
Gaviria, felizmente casado, con 3 hijos, ingeniero de petróleos con amplia
experiencia en el sector petrolero. Desde hace muchos años me he dado cuenta de
que mi carrera me encanta, pero la cocina y el trabajo social me apasionan.
Hace dos meses, a raíz de la crisis petrolera por la caída de los precios, fui
despedido sin justa causa de la empresa donde trabajaba hacía ya casi 8 años y
más que ver esta situación como preocupante y con pesimismo, creo que se me ha
abierto una oportunidad para trabajar en mis pasiones. </p><ul>
<li>Adicionalmente, creo que
este es el momento para hacer una labor social importante y es brindarle
trabajo a las poblaciones desplazadas y a los actores del post-conflicto
colombiano. Colombia ha vivido por más de cincuenta años una guerra entre
grupos alzados en armas y el Gobierno legítimo democrático, lo que ha causado
desolación en el campo, poblaciones enteras desplazadas de sus territorios para
llegar a las grandes ciudades a vivir en la miseria, después de haberlo tenido
todo en su territorio.</li> <li>Mi amor por los
programas de contenido social me impulsaron a trabajar en proyectos como el de
la seguridad vial escolar, como consecuencia de una tragedia acontecida en 2004
en Bogotá, en la cual murieron 21 niños y un adulto por falta de legislación
vial en mi país.</li>
<li>Por otra parte,
en mi infancia y posteriormente en mi adolescencia disfruté mucho de las
delicias gastronómicas de mi abuelo, especialmente unos pinchos que eran
sencillamente deliciosos y unas arepas rellenas espectaculares. Estos platos
se convirtieron en necesarios dentro de mi círculo de amigos, los cuales siempre me
persuadían para que convenciera a mi abuelo de hacer asados, brindando los
pinchos y las arepas como plato central. En honor a él, quiero sacar a la venta estos
productos, pues creo que la buena comida no debe ser para unos círculos sociales
pequeños, sino que se debe difundir en poblaciones enteras.</li>
<li>Mi sueño
consiste en poder combinar estas 2 actividades: labor social y comida, para
generar trabajo y vender comida deliciosa.</li>
<li>He observado
que los municipios de Cundinamarca (Colombia) como Cota, Chía, Cajicá, Tabio, Tenjo y Zipaquirá,
entre otras, carecen de sitios para comerse un buen pincho, una buena arepa rellena y una buena salchicha alemana. Por lo general, hay
muchos establecimientos para comer hamburguesas, chorizos y pizzas, pero no
para lo anterior. Con la ayuda
que ustedes me puedan brindar, podré, no solamente hacer mi sueño realidad, brindando
productos de óptima calidad, fabricados con las mejores carnes de res y de
cerdo, maduradas cuidadosamente, sino hacerle un tributo a mi abuelo. </li>

So i start searching for products which i can import in UAE, then I found a lot of products, but after all the calculation for transport, custom duty and other charges I get disappointed and I was ready to close this company and go back to my country.  

One day I met a friend who show me the Honey Spoon ,and from that time I'm in love whit this product. It's so nice and practical for the Hotels, Restaurants ,Coffee shops  and  Big Companies  which daily are drinking Coffee, Tea and other hot drinks.            

I'm new in this business and my vision for future development on my company ,to sell my product not only in UAE 
Currently
I 'm running crowd funding campaign in ‘’ Indiegogo.com ‘’to sell my product all over the world .
If you want be part of my campaign , and  contribute amount of your choice, for making my
dream to become a live and share my link with others . ''

<p><b>ZOE &amp; JO’S MISSION</b></p>
<p>Our Mission is to teach as many children as possible self-rescue in the water. These specialised skills will aid babies and children to orient themselves in the water and self rescue.</p>
<p>Our intention is to help prevent the tragedy of drowning through education, training and fun, and help those around the world who would otherwise not have the opportunity to learn these skills.</p>
<p>Our training program will also enable other adults to become practitioners and share these skills within their community.</p>
<p>We intend to set up our business, Children Of The Water, in Ibiza. We will then take our skills to remote areas of the world to train adults to set up their own Children Of The Water schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM</b></p>
<p>No family should be denied the opportunity to learn The Children Of The Water self rescue skills. Therefore we aim to offer as many scholarships to families who can not afford the program. Will aim to do this through donations &amp; fundraising and wonderful sites such as this.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE PROBLEM</b><br/></p>
<p>More than two persons every minute die from drowning every year around the globe. From that more than 50 per cent are children, including children who can swim.<br/></p>
<p>Drowning can occur in as little as 1 inch of water. A child will lose consciousness approximately 2 minutes after submersion. Irreversible brain damage occurs after 4-6 minutes. Watching your children is not enough to protect them from every hazardous water situation. Teaching children survival swimming skills provides an extra layer of protection. Learning to roll onto their backs and float unassisted is crucial for survival. </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">HOW CAN CHILDREN OF THE WATER HELP?</b><br/></p>
<p>Babies and young children from the age of 6 months (crawling) up to 6 years learn to survive through this specialised course when falling in the water unexpectedly. Children will learn how to relax, float and control their breathing even while being in a stressful situation, such as falling in the water without their parents or supervisor present.</p>
<p><b>What do the children learn?</b></p>
<p>Infants six months (crawling) to twelve months can learn to:</p>

<p>Some infants may even learn to propel a short distance through the water between two parents. Learning these skills takes approximately 16-20 lessons, depending on the capabilities of your child.</p>
<p>Children who are walking (starting from 1 years old until as old as 6 years) can learn to:</p>
<p>  * hold their breath in the water<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  * swim with their face in the water to a safe place/parent<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  * roll over onto their back when they need to breathe<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  * flip back onto their tummy to continue to swim until reaching there destination.<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  * perform these skills fully clothed</span></p>
<p>Learning these skills takes approximately 16 to 24 lessons, depending on the capabilities of the child. Lessons are one -on - one and app. 10-15 minutes each</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How you teach a baby who cannot talk:</b><br/></p>
<p>Swimming and floating are motor skills that are taught through repetitive exercise, along with gentle verbal encouragement. We will show them what we want them to do, and over a short period of time, they will learn the skills necessary to survive. Don't worry! We will not throw your baby/toddler into the water! We will use a variety of methods, combining the best ideas from swim schools, infant/toddler programs throughout the world.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our goal is to make learning fun so that your child will love being in the water!</span></p>

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE IMPACT</b><br/></p>
<p>Anyone that has experienced a family member or friends death through drowning, knows the devastating effect it causes. As adults it is our duty to teach our children safe practice in the water. Being able to swim is of course essential, however to teach our children techniques that could potentially save there life is their right to be taught. Furthermore, children who do not have the opportunity to have swimming lessons or access to these specialised techniques, we will make it our mission to raise the money to offer as many free spaces as possible. We want to make sure that these techniques are accessible to people who may not otherwise have access to them.</p>
<p>Zoë &amp; Jo are two mothers based in Ibiza. We have children who are 3 and 4 years old and we have both experienced near drowning experiences with our children. On both occasions we were supervising our children. Drowning in a pool can happen so fast, so quietly. This is what led Zoe to undertake this course some years ago with her then 2 1/2 son Nui. At 4 years old, he is now a very confident swimmer and has learnt the skills of survival in the water so that if an accident occurred, panic is reduced and the skills would be cognitively put into practice. </p>
<p>We have complete faith that this business will be a huge success due to its nature and demand from parents to safe guard their children in and near water.</p>

From the seat of our bicycles, we will be making a two and half month journey across America.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Shortstown has come a long way and when our family  moved here we felt such a strong community sense. When our first son was born we began to feel like there was nowhere to meet in town, even though we were able to make so many friends. We felt that community here  strives to meet  through social clubs, but mostly outside or in the village hall and that is not always open and not available for regular meet ups. </p>
<p>Friendly Nettle Cafe is striving to become a cafe that brings the Shortstown community together. Our dream is to create a social place where people from all walks of life can meet and connect in a variety of activities such as crafts, music events, and book clubs. We are creating something special for kids here as well!</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568648948/cenixogsc0lkn7kqnjom.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Ok, I (Rasa) have been dreaming about a community cafe for a while (over 8 years to be precise), way before moving into Shortstown and marrying Joni. Of course back then it wasn’t really possible to open a cafe, so I started blogging instead. I thought to create a virtual space for crafters of all sorts though only partially successful (not very high tech over here). However I still enjoy writing stories about makes and bakes. So yeah! I love crafting, knitting, crochet, sewing, and more, and trying out new hobbies. Therefore expect the new cafe be very crafty, but not exclusive to crafters (We welcome all).</p>
<p>Joni is a very supportive husband. Very helpful to everyone, hands on sort of guy. He also loves the local community and earlier this year he became a parish councillor to serve Shortstown. Anyways he’s also an aerospace systems engineer by trade and very high tech (very useful for website building and more). His technical knowledge has been very useful in obtaining all the planning permissions for the cafe as well as creating wonderful floor plans and so much more. Basically is a great asset to the company and to our family!</p>
<h3>What We Already Have</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568650122/eif1lgr9q8b5lbp4gq6e.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568650092/qk73ripnqkdajoo81iby.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have been very lucky to secure medium sized commercial property next to other local shops including Tesco, pharmacy and fish and chip shop. It's large enough for kids corner, local events, gatherings and more! Currently it is in the shell form meaning it does not even have windows, floors, electric wiring and so much more. So you can imagine, it is huge investment for us. Luckily 30% of initial budget has been given to us by family and 70% have been loaned.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Sadly as soon as we started works and getting more detailed quotes,  we realised we are 15% short even though we are doing as much of cafe fit out as we can ourselves. Which is why we will need to sacrifice all of the money reserved for stock and initial cashflow, but even after spending all that we will be about 10K short. This is why we need your help. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a native of Gaston County and care deeply for this community, which is experiencing substantial economic growth, however we are lacking growth in the arts and entertainment industry. I feel it is important to bring arts and entertainment to the downtown district. With your help, The Rooster can fill this void. With our proximity to larger cities, our local talent needs a home of their own, and we aim to provide it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding in order to bring our building up to current building and zoning codes. We have the perfect location, however the investment needed to make the building safe is a little larger than we expected.  We are short on the amount of financing we are able to attain and need a little help getting us over the hump.</p>
<p>In return for your generous support, we will be offering tee shirts, hats and tickets to shows of your choice!  We are offering a tiered perk package in exchange for your support.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal, we still plan to use every dollar we raise to get The Rooster open.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Rooster is going to be more than just another music hall....we are focused on community. Giving the arts community a safe place to perform helps build confidence and provides opportunity to master their skills. In addition to becoming a ""home"" for the arts, we firmly believe that this community needs access to entertainment in order to grow. While there are a handful of places that do have a great nightlife atmosphere, we seek to fill that some of the void that currently exists and give people a place to go for a fun night out in town!</p>
<p>We also seek to keep a diverse schedule of events, making The Rooster a place that is inclusive, with an atmosphere that is fun and inviting.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In order to create the environment we intend to create and be successful, we must keep our establishment safe, and we are committed to doing so.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us by sharing our campaign with your own personal network. Every little bit helps!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Let me re-introduce myself. I'm Eilene Shaffer. My three favorite things are desserts, coffee and CATS. We are opening a cat lounge in Buckingham, PA. (It will have a Doylestown address when you look for us - 3617 Old East Road, Doylestown) If you love cats or if you are plain curious, this is your place to hang out as our adoptable cats roam the cat room which we invite you to come and enjoy. We are partnered with Bucks County SPCA and Kitty Junction for our cat residents. Yes, they live here in our barn themed cat room until adopted. We need to make the space purrfect for them and you. With your support, we can make this happen NOW.</p>
<h3><strong>What we need</strong></h3>
<p>For those you have been with us since we began this journey last July (!@$^$#!), we have gone through 12 leases for an abundant or reasons to unbelievable to believe. It has given me<i> lots</i> of experience. I tend to believe that was the hard part. Now onto the fun part of setting up shop. We have construction and refitting costs. There is a retail part to MeWow to pay for things like lights and staff but the cat room relies on you! There is no cost to our partner adoption agencies, Bucks County SPCA &amp; Kitty Junction, to have their cats live with us. For now, help us get the doors open. The $5000 I'm raising will pay for everything needed for construction furnishing and supplies to open the cat room portion of MeWow. Any money raised will go towards this goal.</p>
<p>Believe you me, it will be one heck of a party when we open and to our loyal followers, thank you for all your patience and incredible support. We were never giving up, just had to take a very, very long road to get here. THANK YOU BUCKINGHAM TOWNSHIP, CROSSKEYS DEVELOPMENT and LARRY PESESKI.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our cats have a permanent home in our barn themed cat room until adopted. This satellite location for our partner agencies frees up valuable space in their shelters to house more displaced cats.</li>
<li>MeWow intends to offer seminars and events to help support our Central Bucks County Community. Have an idea? We want to hear it.</li>
<li>For the humans, it's a place to love and be loved. Our cats will play and snuggle with you. In our fast-paced world, humans need refuge too.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Cat Cafes are not a new idea just new to the United States. They began in Asian countries 30 years ago where people living in densely populated high rise apartments were not allowed to have pets. There are just over 100 in the United States and one is coming right here to Bucks County!</p>
<p>To know me is know that I am outside the box thinker that does not give up. There is always more than one way to overcome an obstacle. Take finding a location. No matter what was thrown at me and as many disappointing outcomes, I kept at it. And now we have the purrfect location. I will bring that same tenacity to assuring MeWow's success. I don't give up, I give it everything I've got. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need your monetary support but we also need you to tell everyone you know by shouting it from the rooftops. Or going with our theme, hollering it from the hayloft! Yodel it out on all your social platforms. The links are provided below.</p>
<p>You can also help us by having a fundraiser of your own. All money will be used on the creation of the cat room and care of our resident fur babies. </p>

<p><b>Great project, help us make a dream come true.</b></p>
<p><b>Hallo, mijn naam is Bianca,</b></p>
<p>Ik ben een 34-jarige moeder van 3 kinderen.</p>
<p>Getrouwd met Maurice sinds 20-7-2007.We wonen in  Kerkrade ,Nederland.</p>
<p>Mijn droom is om een bestaande ​​camping  over te nemen.  De camping ligt dus in Utscheid in de Eifel. De camping ligt midden in een beschermd natuur gebied. altijd al eens in vos in het wild tegen willen komen of misschien een Ree, hier kan dat.</p>
<p><strong>De omgeving</strong><br/>camping is gelegen aan de rand van het kleine dorpje Utscheid in een door bossen en  heuvels omgeven klein dal. Utscheid ligt in het natuurpark de Duitse Zuid Eifel tussen Bitburg (15km) en het Luxemburgse Vianden (20km) en op circa 350 km van Utrecht. (GPS: N 49o59.956 E 006o21.191)</p>
<p>Kenmerkend voor dit gebied is het eindeloze netwerk van kleine bochtige wegen door bossen en open hoogtes, langs rivieren, beekjes, stuwmeren en reservoirs. Het afwisselende landschap is geschikt voor zowel gevorderde als beginnende kampeerders. Op de motor rijd u door een glooiend landschap, wat wil je dan nog meer.<br/>Of maak eens een wandeling; op elk moment kun je vossen, hazen of reeen e.d tegenkomen.</p>
<p>We zijn van plan het bestaande concept aan te passen en er een bloeiende camping van te gaan maken.</p>
<p>Nu wordt er voornamelijk ingezet op motorrijders, maar wij zien ook graag de ouderen onder ons, om van hun welverdiende rust te genieten op onze camping.</p>
<p>Ook gezinnen met en zonder kinderen is een doelgroep voor ons, en natuurlijk de wandelaars en fietsers,,ooit al eens willen zweefvliegen ook dat maken we mogelijk.</p>
<p>Maar waarom dan nu een camping zult u denken.</p>
<p>Dit omdat we in 2009 op 5 augustus, voor een korte vakantie verbleven in Bulgariije.Toen een vreselijk ongeluk gebeurde die dag, het maakte van deze vakantie  een drama. Meerdere gezinsleden, waaronder ook ik zelf raakten gewond en mijn vader stierf een dag later, als gevolg van dit ongeval !!</p>
<p>Vanaf die dag, was ik op zoek naar een antwoord, en Camping Little Creek is het antwoord.</p>
<p>Het doel is om deze camping  te kopen en rond de klok als een familiebedrijf te gaan runnen.</p>
<p>Donateurs en investeerders kunnen mij helpen, om  kampeerders, hun welverdiende rust maar ook het juiste vakantie gevoel te  geven, wat iedereen op zijn tijd  verdient. Om natuurlijk te ontspannen en  te genieten, in een veilige natuurlijke omgeving.  Met de keuken die aanwezig is, toveren wij dan diverse menu's op uw bord en kunt u genieten van zowel Eifel producten als Nederlandse en Duitse keuken.</p>
<p>Door te financieren. doneren op mijn crowdfundingsproject, zullen donateurs mede bijdragen, om dit beschermde natuur gebied in vorm te houden. Iedereen krijgt, voor hun donatie zelfs een gratis vakantie korte of lang afhankelijk van de donatie.</p>
<p>Zie verder hieronder, hoe u een gratis vakantie kunt krijgen !!!</p>
<p>Het bedrag van de financiering is in totaal € 220.000, - .. dit is het geld dat we moeten investeren.In totaal moeten we ongeveer € 100,000, - financieren met eigen  middelen.</p>
<p>De financiering wordt verkregen, door een lening van de bank, en eventuele investeerders. Voorbeeld, leveranciers van food  en non food investeren mee.</p>
<p>Een deel van het geld dat we investeren is van eigen spaargeld.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Wij Geven donateurs, korte vakanties, lange vakanties, of een periode van vijf jaar gratis vakantie op onze camping, als tegenprestatie.</span><br/></p>

Hello, my name is Bianca,
I am a 34 year old mother of 3 kids. 
Married with Maurice since 20-7-2007.We live in a town called Kerkrade in the Netherlands.

My dream is to start a campingground , the idea became me 2 months ago, when i saw that little creek was for sale. This protected nature area, where you can meet european wildlife.Area
The  camp is located on the outskirts of the small village Utscheid and is surrounded by woods and hills, small valley. Utscheid lies in the nature of the German South Eifel between Bitburg (15km) and the Luxembourg Vianden (20km) and approximately 350 km from Utrecht . (GPS: N 49o59.956 E 006o21.191)
Characteristic of this area is the endless network of small winding roads through forests and open heights, along rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs. The varied landscape is suitable for both experienced and novice riders.
Or take a walk;  foxes, hares and deer come across  at any time.

The moment i saw this campground i was in love.

In 2009 on 5 august, we where staying for a short vacation in Bulgaria.Then a terrible accident happend  that day, it made this vacation into a drama. Severall family members where injured and my father died a day later, because of this accident!!

From that day on, i was searching for an answer, and Little creek is the Answer.

The purpose is to buy this ground and work around the clock as a family business.
Contributers can help me, to give  people the vaction/hollidays they deserve, to enjoy the nature..and  increase stress,  in a save natural environment
By funding on my campain, contributers will contribute to keep this valley in shape, and gain for them selves a free vacation, short or long depending, on the donation.
See further below how to gain free vacations!!!
    The amount of funding is in total € 100.000,-..this is the money we have to invest as privat money.In total we need about €220.000,-.
Which we gain by getting a loan from the bank, and some investors which provide as suppliers of food and drinks and mobilhomes.
A part of the money we gain of or own savings.
-We  give contributers, short vacations, long vacations, or a five year free vacation on our campground.

</div></div>","Thank you for your service means something special and we created a ""special benefit"" that everyone can enjoy, including you.  In conversations with many post 911 veterans, the idea kept emerging of being in a place with the opportunity to exhale, relax and truly unwind from the stress of combat related activities.A sort of decompression period, learning to have fun again, talking with fellow veterans through difficult shared experiences; having some uninterrupted time to unwind from being on high alert, and adjust instead, to enjoying a return to normalcy again. The conviction that most of us prize a vacation precisely for its rejuvenative aspects, made this approach more than just a feel good opportunity. From the outset, the Caribbean resonated as precisely the sort of environment, a place of decompression that we all would embrace, civilians and military alike.After having clearly seen this need, realizing that all the threads of information were aligning with my connection points, accepting the call that I was among the cavalry, I tasked myself with spearheading this particular initiative.""Veteran’s at the beach""; if it was to be, it had to be me.Certainly, were we less enthusiastic or driven, we could leave this up to major corporations and layers of bureaucracy or “donors with deep pockets” and have it not see the light of day.We knew that this could not be the case because it was way too important. We had to do something. Now pause and think about the value of ""a penny"" for a moment as we continue with our story. 
""Veteran’s at the Beach"" is our pilot program, a testable prototype of a ""Caribbean safe house"" with a Jeep, and we are asking for your support through ""unleashing the power of penny"".  Through unlocking this special relationship with you and using the power of your penny, You too are the cavalry, you would desperately want to see if “cornered alone on a ridge somewhere far, far from home”. 
""Thank you for your service"" means something, it always has, and clearly it means something to you too.   
Together, through Indiegogo and with your support, we found a way to unlock and ""unleash the power of a penny"" and made it possible so you too could enjoy a Caribbean vacation just as well.
 
With your support we aim to improve access for the physically challenged and to equip the Villa with an Unlimited model Jeep.
 
Your penny paid forward, unleashes the fun for you too.",3.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h4>WHAT WE WANT TO CHANGE:</h4>
<h4>All across the Western World, but 
in European Capitals in particular, the native inhabitants are being 
driven out of their own cities by a ruthless housing market that seeks 
to maximize profits by raising rents and sales prices to ever new 
dazzling heights. This phenomenon is known in Germany under the phrase 
""Gentrification"".</h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4><b>Gentrification is the buying and 
renovating of houses and stores in deteriorated urban neighborhoods by 
wealthier individuals, which in effect increases property values and 
displaces low-income families and small businesses.This is a common and 
widespread controversial topic in urban planning. It refers to shifts in
 an urban community lifestyle and an increasing share 
of wealthier residents and/or businesses and increasing property values.</b></h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4><b>Gentrification is typically the result 
of increased interest in a certain environment. Early ""gentrifiers"" may 
belong to low income artists or boheme communities, which increase the 
attractiveness and flair of a certain quarter. Further steps are 
increased investments in a community by real estate 
development businesses, local government, or community activists and 
more economic development, increased attraction of business and 
lower crime rates. In addition to these potential benefits, 
gentrification can lead to population migration.</b></h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4><b>In a community undergoing 
gentrification, the average income increases. Poorer ""pre-gentrification"" 
residents who are unable to pay increased rents or property taxes may 
find it necessary to relocate.</b></h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4><b>It is this problem, which the 1ROOMS project seeks to eliminate, or at least ""ease"". </b></h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4><b>We believe that we CAN make a difference regarding this development by creating affordable housing both for sale and for rent. </b></h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4><b>WHO ARE THE CUSTOMERS/Beneficiaries? </b></h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4><b>Lower to Medium income singles wishing to live in European inner cities. By building our 1 ROOM RESIDENCY we address multiple problems:<b>A

<p><b>Business Registration (P 10,000.00)</b><br/>This estimated amount should cover the expenses to register Cafe Mayumi to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), as well as the Business Permit, the Barangay Clearance, the Community Tax Certificate, and special permits such as food safety and sanitary.</p>
<p><b>Virtual-Office Address (P 6,000.00)</b><br/>We managed to find an office-solutions company that gives an affordable rate for a six-month contract of getting our own business address. It's a virtual office so only the essential features such as correspondence and document pickup, but it's a start - after all, we operate during events anyway.</p>
<p><b>Initial Working Capital (P 6,500.00)</b><br/>The remainder of this amount will serve as our costs for providing the perks to contributors, as well as the purchase of cafe ingredients and supplies that we need for future event-participations.</p>
<p>One important note: the initial working capital does not include our salaries. We'll rely on the total sales that we make for every event we participate.</p>

</div></div>","Team Fillypiñana is a group of students from different schools, getting together to form an arts, crafts, and special events team. The Team was created way back in January 2014, originally to pull off an arts-and-crafts convention for fans of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic called FillyPiñana. In the year 2014, Team Fillypiñana pulled off two special events, FillyPiñana and Rari-Tea Party, which is an actual tea party originally for the same fans of My Little Pony.In the year 2015, Team Fillypiñana pulled off the 2nd annual Rari-Tea Party, but it has begun transcending from the pony-fandom community to the mainstream market by means of booth participations in events. Team Fillypiñana first appeared as an exhibitor in the Tamashii Convention last March 2015, wherein they showcased its signature product called Rari-Tea Sugar Drops. But the Team's first real step to the transition was their participation as one of the 49 food vendors in the Ultimate Taste Test last September 2015.Since the breakthrough, Team Fillypiñana continued to participate as a food vendor in two bazaars during 2015: the Picky Palates Weekend Market and the Maginhawang Pasko.Café Mayumi is Team Fillypiñana's food-service division headed by Mr. Budz Marata. Created in December 2015 after the success of the Team's appearance in Ultimate Taste Test 2015, Café Mayumi envisions to be the ""go-to mobile café for all types of events ranging from big-scale conventions, expos and fairs, to private functions and parties."" 
The Café aims to provide coffee and tea beverages that are not only appealing and presentable, but also reasonably affordable. The Café Menu may consist the following:

Brewed coffee and tea
Café lattés
Tea lattés
Fruity tea drinks
Hot chocolate
Chocolate fudge and other desserts

The Café can also offer coffee/tea-and-dessert catering services for private functions, parties, conferences, and other events.
Café Mayumi is set to participate in Komiket 2016 (February 20), and the Entrepreneurs and Franchise Expo 2016 (March 11-13).



We have many reasons why we're putting up this fundraising campaign (and they're probably even mentioned in the video above). But the main reason for this campaign is that we want to be the ""on-the-go"" café that can serve quality food and beverages to event attendees who want to get the café experience without having to step out of the venue or leave the event hall. 



One of the questions many contributors will ask is: where will the money go? To answer that question, here is a simple breakdown of our expenses for Café Mayumi:

Business Registration (P 10,000.00)This estimated amount should cover the expenses to register Cafe Mayumi to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), as well as the Business Permit, the Barangay Clearance, the Community Tax Certificate, and special permits such as food safety and sanitary.
Virtual-Office Address (P 6,000.00)We managed to find an office-solutions company that gives an affordable rate for a six-month contract of getting our own business address. It's a virtual office so only the essential features such as correspondence and document pickup, but it's a start - after all, we operate during events anyway.
Initial Working Capital (P 6,500.00)The remainder of this amount will serve as our costs for providing the perks to contributors, as well as the purchase of cafe ingredients and supplies that we need for future event-participations.
One important note: the initial working capital does not include our salaries. We'll rely on the total sales that we make for every event we participate.



We have a selection of perks for you to choose from, depending on the amount of contribution that you want to place. You can look at the right-hand side of this campaign page for all the details.
A $2 contribution amount will get you a simple thank-you card sent by yours truly, Team Fillypinana. A $3 contribution amount will get you a 10-piece pack of our innovative product: Rari-Tea Sugar Drops. 






A $5 contribution amount will get you a featured perk: a special invitation card to Rari-Tea Party 2016 sent to your mailbox. And yes, you heard right - we'll send you an ACTUAL STATIONERY invitation card, not a digital card. Full details of Rari-Tea Party 2016 will be announced via a later update on Indiegogo, as well as an announcement on Facebook and on the Team Fillypinana website.


A $10 contribution amount will get you a gift called Illuminated Pages, crafted by our very own Team member Macky Reyes.




The succeeding amounts from $25 to $100 will get you one of Café Mayumi's catering services. You can choose from a simple tea party package for 4 people, to a big package for your next birthday party! Just remember to negotiate with us on where and when you want us to deliver and perform our café services. Another important note: if two or more contributors want our services on the same day, we'll prioritize the first caller - the others will have to choose a different date.



f we get to reach our $500 goal, we'll finally be able to build Cafe Mayumi. But we also have milestone goals for Cafe Mayumi, because the more funds we acquire, the better-equipped the cafe! What's better is that if we reach at least $1,000, we will hold our 3rd annual Rari-Tea Party for our loyal guests (who got to attend our tea party in 2014 and/or 2015) as well as curious first-time guests!

“The eating gorilla is the image of the true man,
the true woman. He demonstrates the principle of
true politics, of real human existence, in which we
are always presently connected to the Food Source

<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>Recently, New York City
pledged $8.2 billion in public funds to a 15 year affordable housing plan
addressing homelessness.  But in this
indispensable safety net, there is a 
gaping hole and falling through it are <u>teenaged mothers and their
children who do not meet the criteria for affordable housing; rather, they are
limited to living in shelters. </u></p>
<p></p>
<p>My social enterprise, PedaCorp, Inc.,  deals directly with this crisis. I am seeking $15,000 for a
down payment on a property that will provide affordable housing to young
mothers aging out of a foster home or at-risk of homelessness.  Also, PedaCorp will provide a supportive
network and a variety of services that will help them transition to an independent
life.  </p>
<p>One of the reasons I feel so passionate about this issue is
that I am among those who aged out of foster care as a young mother with
limited resources.  What I had was
resilience and the help of people, like you, along the way.  The kind of help I received is now this kind
of help and support I am seeking for young mothers aging out of foster care. </p>
<p>Today, I have a home, two beautiful children, 20 years of
professional experience as a child welfare and housing administrator, two
Master’s degrees, and the know-how to provide young mothers with some stability
and a way to move forward. </p>
<p>In this uncertain economy, the city does not lack for crisis
and social services to deal with them. 
This particular crisis, however, is being tragically ignored.  That is why I am asking for your donation to
help PedaCorp to provide the first opportunity of its kind to young mothers
(with one child) who have aged out of the foster care system and into an
uncertain future. </p>
<p>Donations of any amount will be appreciated. </p>
<p>Thank you so much, </p>

<p>The vision of Lincoln's Beard Brewing Co. starts and ends with the local community. In 2014, a group of local craft beer heads endeavored to bring more locally brewed craft beer to the woefully underserved neighborhoods across Miami. We actually first sought to open a craft beer bar that would only serve locally brewed craft beer. But we continued to develop more interesting and delicious home brews, and suddenly started winning multiple brewing competitions and awards. Finally we looked around and noticed that although there are some great craft beer breweries already serving up delicious creations in Miami...there simply aren't enough of them. And <i>none</i> of them are located very close to central Dade County.</p>
