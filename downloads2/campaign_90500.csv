BrightCharger uses only a part of the energy, therefore protecting your battery life, devices, and the environment. BrightCharger also functions as a low energy consumption nightlight which adds, even more, value to the product.  </p><p><strong><u>Doesn't a charger like this already exist?</u> </strong><br/>No, it does not. The idea behind BrightCharger is to avoid unnecessary electricity consumption. The charger switches itself off as soon as the battery is fully charged. Only the very low consumption LED signal light (nightlight) will indicate to users when the device is fully charged. The users can choose whether they want to enable and disable the signal light feature.</p><p><u><strong>My battery was not fully charged (100%) when the BrightCharger stopped charging it. What happened?</strong></u><br/>Our goal is to ensure a charge level above 90% for all USB-chargeable devices at the end of the charging process. Based on the latest studies, this particular charge level is the most beneficial to all USB-chargeable batteries and prolongs their lifespan. </p><p><u><strong>When I plug my phone in before going to bed in the evening, the battery is not fully charged in the morning as the BrightCharger does not allow the charger to maintain the charge level. Why does it do that?</strong></u><br/>This is true when using the BrightCharger. However, as smartphone users may have noticed (and can easily test), charge levels may decrease by up to 5% within minutes of unplugging a when unplugging a fully-charged phone from a charger. In reality, the ideal charge level range for the Lithium-ion batteries of smartphones lies between 10% and 90%. The charge level decreases more rapidly when higher than 90% or lower than 10%. The battery producers provide estimations of how long the battery can be charged. Why worry about such time limits or harm the battery by overcharging it? Thanks to the BrightCharger feature, the lifespan of all batteries is longer.</p><p><u><strong>How much energy can be saved using the BrightCharger?</strong></u><br/>There are only rough estimations of the amount of energy wasted globally in maintaining battery charge levels or by leaving chargers plugged in. We think that saving even a single watt of electricity is good for both the wallet and the environment.</p><p><strong><u>How does </u></strong><u><strong>BrightCharger differ from other chargers that include automated charging technology? How about smartphones that have inbuilt features that stop charging on their own?</strong></u><br/>Many mobile devices contain different battery control systems and automated charging technologies. The automated charging technologies of modern smartphones work well. As soon as the battery is fully charged, maintenance charging ends as the charger switches into standby mode and stops charging the device. The charger itself still continues to consume energy. This energy consumption of high-quality chargers is very low, even close to zero. The problem arises when the charge level of the device decreases by even 1%. This activates the charger and begins charging the device. Depending on the condition and age of the battery, this may take for example 15 minutes, after which the charger’s standby mode is reactivated. As a result of this cycle, the device is charged almost continuously. Another group of chargers consumes small amounts of energy (e.g. 1.5 W). After connecting the phone to the charger and achieving a full charge level, this basic consumption increases slightly (e.g. to 1.8 W) to maintain the charge level – essentially charging the phone continuously. The third group of chargers and devices have no automated charging technologies.</p><p><u><strong>I could imagine purchasing a BrightCharger if it did not waste electricity on the LED signal light.</strong></u><br/>It is true that Brightcharger continues to consume energy because of the signal light (the nightlight mode). These consumption levels, thanks to modern LED-technology, are very close to zero. Additionally, the nightlight mode can be disabled, and the charger switches itself off completely as soon as the battery is fully charged.</p><h3>For any other question, please contact:  <a href=""mailto:hello@brightcharger.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@brightcharger.com</a> </h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495533145/r8jcva8jeyi1e3jf8bql.png"" src=""""/></p></div>","A revolutionary charger that saves energy and the environment, as well as protects your batteries lifespan.

This means we only get to keep the amount of money raised if we reach 100% of our funding goal, so there is no risk for you. Why should I buy BrightCharger over any other charger?Regular chargers consume unnecessary energy by forcing idle power to a connected battery even after the battery is already full. BrightCharger uses only a part of the energy, therefore protecting your battery life, devices, and the environment. BrightCharger also functions as a low energy consumption nightlight which adds, even more, value to the product.  Doesn't a charger like this already exist? No, it does not. The idea behind BrightCharger is to avoid unnecessary electricity consumption. The charger switches itself off as soon as the battery is fully charged. Only the very low consumption LED signal light (nightlight) will indicate to users when the device is fully charged. The users can choose whether they want to enable and disable the signal light feature.My battery was not fully charged (100%) when the BrightCharger stopped charging it. What happened?Our goal is to ensure a charge level above 90% for all USB-chargeable devices at the end of the charging process. Based on the latest studies, this particular charge level is the most beneficial to all USB-chargeable batteries and prolongs their lifespan. When I plug my phone in before going to bed in the evening, the battery is not fully charged in the morning as the BrightCharger does not allow the charger to maintain the charge level. Why does it do that?This is true when using the BrightCharger. However, as smartphone users may have noticed (and can easily test), charge levels may decrease by up to 5% within minutes of unplugging a when unplugging a fully-charged phone from a charger. In reality, the ideal charge level range for the Lithium-ion batteries of smartphones lies between 10% and 90%. The charge level decreases more rapidly when higher than 90% or lower than 10%. The battery producers provide estimations of how long the battery can be charged. Why worry about such time limits or harm the battery by overcharging it? Thanks to the BrightCharger feature, the lifespan of all batteries is longer.How much energy can be saved using the BrightCharger?There are only rough estimations of the amount of energy wasted globally in maintaining battery charge levels or by leaving chargers plugged in. We think that saving even a single watt of electricity is good for both the wallet and the environment.How does BrightCharger differ from other chargers that include automated charging technology? How about smartphones that have inbuilt features that stop charging on their own?Many mobile devices contain different battery control systems and automated charging technologies. The automated charging technologies of modern smartphones work well. As soon as the battery is fully charged, maintenance charging ends as the charger switches into standby mode and stops charging the device. The charger itself still continues to consume energy. This energy consumption of high-quality chargers is very low, even close to zero. The problem arises when the charge level of the device decreases by even 1%. This activates the charger and begins charging the device. Depending on the condition and age of the battery, this may take for example 15 minutes, after which the charger’s standby mode is reactivated. As a result of this cycle, the device is charged almost continuously. Another group of chargers consumes small amounts of energy (e.g. 1.5 W). After connecting the phone to the charger and achieving a full charge level, this basic consumption increases slightly (e.g. to 1.8 W) to maintain the charge level – essentially charging the phone continuously. The third group of chargers and devices have no automated charging technologies.I could imagine purchasing a BrightCharger if it did not waste electricity on the LED signal light.It is true that Brightcharger continues to consume energy because of the signal light (the nightlight mode). These consumption levels, thanks to modern LED-technology, are very close to zero. Additionally, the nightlight mode can be disabled, and the charger switches itself off completely as soon as the battery is fully charged.For any other question, please contact:  hello@brightcharger.com",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h2>
<h4><i>1. What is Ares</i></h4>
<p>After nearly a year of research and development, <i><b><span>EasyArts</span></b></i> (<b>making arts easy for you</b>) is now releasing its first launch of <b>All-in-one 3D printer</b> -- <i><b>Ares</b></i>, in the name of the Greek god of war. It is a <b>luxury version at civilian price</b>. We hope that this affordable printer can meet most of your daily requirements in terms of creation and innovation. <i>Ares</i> is especially suitable for fans, enterprise, homes, educational institutions or any other interested in 3D printer.</p>
<h4><i>2. Ares gains reputation</i></h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440110709/empz6lwasuebqnwy74v2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4><i style=""line-height: 24px;"">3. What pushes us to develop Ares</i></h4>
<p>Right now, there are so many 3D printers on the market that it is really hard for users to make a decision. So the main problem is which one is more suitable, for instance, most cost-effective or easiest to use? We (<i><span>EasyArts</span></i> team) were ever faced with the same dilemma. That is why we decided to develop a new printer integrated with multi-functional modules, as well as stable structure, friendly interface, easy operation and affordable price. <b>We believe that 3D printers should be common items just like household laser printers, rather than high-tech products far from folks</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>

</h2>
<p>You may wonder why such a good product is at such a low price. It might even seem incredible to you, as overall the 3D printers on market is a bit expensive. You may once wish you could have a low-cost 3D printer, and so did us. But now we dare say that it has become reality. Ares is just for you, really <b>cost-effective</b> and highly <b>extendable</b>. However, low-cost doesn’t necessarily mean poor quality. Actually, if interested in Ares, you should read our story slowly and carefully, then you will think Ares is of <b>high quality</b>. Honestly, we have to admit that we couldn’t make it without several advantages.</p>
<h4><i style=""line-height: 24px;"">1. Open-source</i></h4>
<p>Our design is based on open-source, both in terms of software and firmware. It is our full use of the creativity from all over the world that saves the time and cost during the development.</p>
<h4><i style=""line-height: 24px;"">2. Made in China</i></h4>
<p>You probably have known something about “Made in China”, as the product manufacturing is highly developed in China. “Made in China” makes the most contribution to manufacturing good products by skilled workers yet with much lower labor costs.</p>
<h4><i style=""line-height: 24px;"">3. To gain visibility</i></h4>
<p>In fact, the price is almost at the cost of our products. Our aim of this campaign is to raise the awareness of public that most of you can <b>afford 3D printers</b>. It is no longer a high-tech product. As a start-up company for 3D printing, <b>quality is the key to survival</b>. So we worry more about the quality of <i>Ares </i>than you.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434905415/znqaurqfydiii7qhqpd6.png"" src="""" style=""width: 42px;height: 40px;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;""> Why should choose <i>Ares</i></span>
</h2>
<h4><i>1. Full-metal Body: Say no to deformation</i></h4>
<p>Metal body is a major feature of <i>Ares</i>, along with black exterior, making it low profile and steady, but also luxurious. Moreover, more than 90% of the load-bearing parts are made by metal and processed <b>by CNC</b>. In addition, the driving belt is made of polyurethane and steel wire to avoid deformation. It is worth mentioning that the full-metal body contributes to minimize the gap between the parts, and thus to prevent any possible distortion during printing. Therefore, the printed parts present extremely smooth
surfaces, surpassing the apparent staircase effect in other hot-melt printers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434819691/zpoib8u95yfxdf7saz7f.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><i>2. Modular Design: Unlimited extension of your imagination</i></h4>
<p>Modular design enables users greater space for extension. As the core of this printer, the<b> switchable platform</b> plays a vital role. It allows users to take advantage of the reserved holes on it to adapt various nozzles, like laser transmitters, CNC cutters and so on. Besides, the aviation aluminum alloy connector, processed by surface adonization and CNC, is the privilege accessory for Ares to meet multi-functional connections. Most of all, you can design your own connectors to adapt your extended tools. The function of your 3D printer can be instantly upgraded and converted, as long as the adapter or connector matches the reserved holes. In addition, with <b>up to 15 ports</b>, the aerial socket for wiring provides possibilities for unlimited upgrade.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h4><i>3. Commercially Open-source: Be support technician yourself</i></h4>
<p>We know that many people worry about the <b>technical support</b> and <b>warranty</b>. Indeed, it will spend too much time and money for you and us if something wrong happens to Ares after delivery. So we will always get Ares <b>completely checked before shipping</b>. We have tested our prototypes everyday for over 4 months, it still works very well. <b>We can guarantee that the overall structure is stiff and durable, like the motors, gears, linear guide-way, joint, PCB boards, driving belt and so on</b>.</p>
<p>However, like most products, there exists vulnerable parts like print nozzle. For both of your and our convenience, we will publish <b>the details of currently commercially available parts</b> in our user manual. In this way, you can renew most of the broken parts yourself. <b>Of course you can email us your problem and we will surely give you technical support</b>. We hope this (commercially open-source) can help you and us address most of your problem during daily creation.</p>

<h4><i>1. 3D printing: Colorful, complex and even tiny</i></h4>
<p>Similar to many other 3D printers, PLA filaments is the main consume materials in terms of 3D printing function, as it is both friendly to human and environment. So of course you can make colorful and complex 3D samples and even products. Particularly, the minimized gap between the moving parts significantly prevents apparent staircase effect on the surface of printed models. Surprisingly, <i>Ares</i> can print tiny model even <b>smaller than finger</b>. (Models are from Thingiverse)</p>

<h4><i>2. Laser engraving: Essential tool for DIY makers</i></h4>
<p>As laser engraving is very popular to DIY makers, <i>Ares</i> series are also equipped with laser engraving kits. In consideration of practicality and safety, we think 300mW power will be enough for daily DIY. For instance, you can engrave your logo or picture on a card, leather, or wood, and even cut the paper into your design. Worried about the precision? Just scan the 2D code below and see what happens on <b>Wechat</b> or <b>Facebook</b>.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h4><i>3. CNC engraving (under development): 3D pictures</i></h4>
<p>In view of practicality and safety, the CNC engraving kit for <i>Ares</i> consists of a motor (maximum speed - 4000 rpm/min) and milling cutters of <b>various sizes</b> for corn. So now 3D pictures are available for you by engraving patterns on the cork and wood. Besides, you can design arbitrarily complex 3D models to form your exclusive wooden carvings in relief.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h4><i>4. 3D Scanning: Much more creation and extension</i></h4>
<p>3D scanning, or 3D reversion, just makes your creation and extension simpler and easier. With laser line scanners, and high-definition cameras, Ares can deal with most of daily objects very well in <b>high resolution</b>. The design of quick setup makes 3D scanner <b>portable</b> and <b>efficient for installation</b>. In addition, you have many options to output the results, making it more convenient for <b>modification</b> and much more <b>practical</b> in DIY.</p>

<h4>
<i>5. WiFi Access: So close to Ares</i>
</h4>
<p>The <b>Raspberry-Pi</b>, an open source hardware built in <i>Ares</i>, is the central processing unit, much like the brain that controls <i>Ares</i>. Thanks to the support of <b>WiFi</b>, Raspberry-Pi makes it possible to achieve remote control and monitoring of your printer just by following our simple instruction and configuration, much easier than ever before. Surprisingly, you even may need't purchase a monitor for this function, just unplug the webcam from your computer instead, if available. It is especially <b>convenient </b>for office workers like you and me, isn't it?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434819838/stpy7nyoitf4wfqxiznt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><i>6.More functions can be added: Unlimited</i></h4>
<p>The functions of Ares 3D printer are not limited to what mentioned above. All of our designs and developments are based on open source firmware and software. As we all know, good quality is the precondition of extension. So we are trying our best to make sure Ares is competent for extension, like metal body, linear guide, aluminum CNC parts and so on. Not only that, you are greatly encouraged to develop your own modules by following our instructions. The standard of your connector or adapter has been defined in the user manual, so that your own design can match the switchable platform. As long as following this rule, chocolate printing, circuit board, any feasible extension is possible.</p>

</h2>
<p>During his PhD research at SC3DP (Singapore Center of 3D Printing, the biggest 3D printing laboratory in Asia), <b>Shuai Li</b> thought that 3D printers should not be the exclusives for laboratory, but also should be common products at low price to bring convenience for the folks with powerful functions. Soon after, he managed to establish a team aimed for this idea, called <i><span>EasyArts</span></i>, and now is the president of it. In <i><span>EasyArts</span></i>, the other members have the same idea and all agree with his leadership.</p>
<p>This is a professional team, consisting of three <b>PhD researchers</b> majored in 3D printing and lots of <b>experienced engineers</b>, skilled in either electrical &amp; electronic, machanical, product engineering, computing technology , or marketing management. It is also a team of high efficiency, owing to the support of the business incubator of <b>Wuhan ITRI</b> (Industrial Technology Research Institute) of Geo-Resources and Environment Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Finally, with the joint efforts of all team members and the leadership of Shuai and Xin, we finished the development of such an awesome product, that is, <b><i>Ares</i> All-in-one 3D Printer</b>. In addition with complete supply chain and excellent capacity for mass production, we are able to ensure <i>Ares</i> can be put on your desk on time.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><i>Core team members</i></h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434995756/t4zieezhkqecvyw0w26c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><i>Brief introduction</i></h4>
<p><b><span>Shuai Li</span></b> is the president and a developer in <i><span>EasyArts</span>.</i> His execution, researching ability and spirit is overwhelming. Most of his inspiration on <i>Ares</i> profits from his research work at SC3DP, and his PhD experience gives him great courage and perseverance to overcome the difficulties during the development of <i>Ares</i>. We can completely immodestly say that he is an expert on 3D printing.</p>
<p><b><span>Xin Li</span></b> is a competent manager due to his master's degree in business (MBA). On account of strong career passion and sharp market insights, he is actually the adviser on what functions of <i>Ares</i> are needed and how much is affordable to most people. So it is his considerable experience in marketing that provides guidance for the development of <i>Ares</i>.</p>
<p><b>Pengju Xue</b>, majored in Mechanical Engineering related to 3D printing, is especially experienced in machinery design. He is the director of the mechanical structure design of <i>Ares</i>, as he can always come up with clever institutions to integrate all kinds of spare parts. So most of what you can see on <i>Ares </i>comes from his idea and inspiration. We are lucky to have such developer.</p>
<p><b>Guiru Zhu</b> is a seasoned engineer. He is worthy of it because he once worked as a mechanical engineer for over 10 years. When he heard of <i><span>EasyArts</span></i>, he decided to leave his current job of high salary, since he also agrees that 3D printing is promising and why not be the common product just like household laser printer. Specifically, he made the most contributions to optimize the mechanical design.</p>
<p><b>Zhichao Chen</b> was Shuai's classmate  during the period of both undergraduate and postgraduate. No wander he is another core member of <i><span>EasyArts</span></i> and the most ardent supporter. The same major and similar interests makes them maintain a high level of understanding in the development of <i>Ares</i>. Currently, he is responsible for the software development because of his programming skills.</p>
<p><b>Weidong Li</b>, similar to Guiru, also quit his high-paying job in Beijing to join <i><span>EasyArts</span></i>. And now he takes charge of electrical &amp; electronic module. He is regarded as a man with strong mastermind power. Just imagine how difficult and complex it is to integrate of so many functions into such limited space and circuit. Finally he made it, because of his hard-working and his professional competence as well.</p>
<p><b>Yuqian Zhang</b> really stood out  other schoolgirls when she was an undergraduate. You know what? She spent her spare time in the library to learn product engineering and technology, which is nothing to do with her major. After several years of work as product engineer at Singapore, she achieved considerable experience on product engineering.</p>
<p><b>Hongyu Tian</b> is particularly good at algorithm and optimization. We would say that he is a high-quality comprehensive talent, as he made lots of efforts and contributions to the mechanical design, software development and product engineering. It is hard to say when <i>Ares</i> could be available for release without his optimization. He is the one who first thought of applying Raspberry-Pi to <i>Ares</i>.</p>

</h2>
<h4><i>1. Supply chain and logistics</i></h4>
<p>No one wants to see a good idea being executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to prepare mass production for <i>Ares</i>, but we still face several challenges. Currently, many suppliers have been secured for the components. The remaining issue is to set up warehouses for the production line. That's why we are constantly working with specialists of supply chain to establish a production line of high efficiency and reliability. The challenge is obvious as we must make sure the delivery of this amazing can be arranged as soon as possible. Delivery of rewards/perks is subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.</p>
<h3><i style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;"">2. Shipping</i></h3>
<p>Shipping costs vary with your country and specific location. To reduce the cost of <i>Ares</i> at the maximum, we decide to charge the shipping costs separately, also for the sake of fairness. After the campaign, we will send you a survey by email to collect your <b>basic contact details</b> like name, address for delivery. Of course you can decide your own option for shipping. However, shipping is another risk which might be out of our control during delivery. So it is recommended that we choose the best shipping option for you, based on your location. According to your option, we will <b>charge <span>extra</span> with the exact costs for shipping</b>. We will arrange the shipment <b><span>only after</span> your payment has been confirmed</b>. If you want to know how much it will cost, please contact us at <span><i><u>easyarts@126.com</u></i></span>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Please read the FAQs below carefully before claim. If you cannot find what you are satisfied with or interested in, don't hesitate to contact us at <span><i><u>easyarts@126.com</u></i></span>.</p>
<h4>
<b style=""background-color: initial;""><span>Q1:</span> Why it shows free shipping when I claim the perk, while actually shipping not included?</b><br/>
</h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> Okay, good question. We do apologize for this conflict. As you know, shipping fee for worldwide is various, so we cannot determine how much the shipping will cost. <b>Indiegogo</b> does <b>NOT</b> support various settings for shipping, so the default fee has to be $0, thus resulting in ""free shipping"". <b>Shipping is NOT included for ""Assembled ARES 3D Printer""</b>. Please refer to the ""Risks and challenges"" section for more details about shipping.</p>
<h4>
<b><span>Q2:</span>Why the price of three optional modules is different from each other?</b><br/>
</h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> Really good point. Many people may be wondering what is the price difference of our three optional modules, which is the same during previous campaign. Actually, if you read the description of these perks, you may realize some difference, that is, ""<b>Shipping HAS BEEN included</b>"". So that is the source of price difference. In other words, <b>CNC costs most while Laser costs least in terms of shipping</b>. We believe this will bring you and us greater convenience, as both of us can just care about the shipping fee of ARES. To put it another way, you won't worry how much it will cost for optional modules, which has been included.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q3:</span> How can you know which module(s) I have claimed without any comments?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> Good question. Of course you can inform us at <span><i><u>easyarts@126.com</u></i></span> about your desired module(s) if you like. Actually, after this campaign, we will contact <b>all of the supporters (contribute $399 or more)</b> to confirm your module(s), no matter you have informed us or not. So don't worry about your module(s). If we still haven't got your confirmation before shipment, you will receive sequential module(s) <b>(LASER ENGRAVING -&gt; 3D SCANNING -&gt; CNC ENGRAVING)</b>, so that you won't get same module(s) for a perk.</p>
<h4>
<b style=""background-color: initial;""><span>Q4:</span> What if there is no available WiFi access? Can this printer work off-line?</b><br/>
</h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> WiFi or Internet access is our <b>featured function</b> for <i>Ares</i> in view of convenience, but <b>NOT</b> <b>required</b>. So you can still use the printer as long as you have a computer. Just connect your PC and 3D printer by the data cable we provide (2 meters long), your <i>Ares</i> will be able to work.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q5: </span>Do I have to install a specific software or app to control the printer?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts:</i></span> No, the control system of <i>Ares</i> has already been installed inside the printer. And we offer a much more convenient option for <i>Ares</i>, that is, <b>telnetting </b>into the printer <b>through browser</b>. Please refer to the user's manual for the specific operation. In this way, you can gain control of <i>Ares</i> provided that you have a browser, no matter what kind of OS you use, for instance, <b>Windows</b>, <b>Mac Os</b>, <b>Linux </b>and <b>Android</b>.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q6:</span> Do I have to prepare specific formatted files for laser engraving or CNC milling function?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> No special files are required for the laser engraving or CNC milling function. A self-developed software can help you deal with JPG/BMP files. We are glad to inform you that the software will be <b>FREE </b>if you claim <b>ANY ONE</b> of the perk <b>except</b> ""Friendly Sponsorship"".</p>
<h4><b><span>Q7:</span> Is it necessary to calibrate the platform before printing?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> Normally <b>NOT</b>. Calibration of the platform is required <b>ONLY </b>when the location of your printer has been changed. In addition, the printer supports <b>automatic calibration</b>, which has been built inside, so don't worry about this if you have to calibrate the platform.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q8:</span> What is the resolution of the scanner? What if I want to scan/reverse colorful objects?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> The available resolution is greater than or equal to 0.3 mm. The <b>HD scanner</b> and <b>camera </b>supports colorful mode, so your scanned models will also <b>in similar color</b>. Please refer to the specification section for more parameters of 3D scanning. Thank you.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q9:</span> What is the consume material for printing? Do I have to buy it from EasyArts?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> Currently the main material for 3D printing function is <b>PLA</b>. It is expected that other various materials will be supported through extensions as well in the near future, for example, high-melting-point plastic (carbon fiber, nylon, graphene etc.). PLA is quite common now, <b>we do offer perks for our contributors</b>, but it is not a must to buy it from us. In fact, we will offer some free PLA (1kg) to improve your experience of <i>Ares</i>.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q10:</span> I am a DIY maker, can I develop my own module(s)?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> Of course. Actually, this printer is for designers and DIY makers. The <b>switchable platform</b> is designed for such extensions. So we really encourage you to do this. Just follow the instructions and the standard for your adapter(s) / connector(s), which will be released after this campaign, you will find it quite easy to develop your own module(s). Go ahead for your imagination and creation.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q11:</span> I am a journalist, can I report the story about your team and your 3D printer?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> You are mostly welcomed. Thank you for your willingness to help us popularize <i>EasyArts</i> and <i>Ares</i>. Don't hesitate to contact us at <span><i><u>easyarts@126.com</u></i></span>.</p>
<h4><b><span>Q12:</span> Do you need any distributors for this 3D printer? Is there any requirement to be your distributors?</b></h4>
<p><span><i>EasyArts</i>:</span> Yes, any distributors interested in our product are warmly welcomed all around the world. We prefer to work together with you to generalize 3D printing technology.

</span></div>","About Ares

1. What is Ares
After nearly a year of research and development, EasyArts (making arts easy for you) is now releasing its first launch of All-in-one 3D printer -- Ares, in the name of the Greek god of war. It is a luxury version at civilian price. We hope that this affordable printer can meet most of your daily requirements in terms of creation and innovation. Ares is especially suitable for fans, enterprise, homes, educational institutions or any other interested in 3D printer.
2. Ares gains reputation

3. What pushes us to develop Ares
Right now, there are so many 3D printers on the market that it is really hard for users to make a decision. So the main problem is which one is more suitable, for instance, most cost-effective or easiest to use? We (EasyArts team) were ever faced with the same dilemma. That is why we decided to develop a new printer integrated with multi-functional modules, as well as stable structure, friendly interface, easy operation and affordable price. We believe that 3D printers should be common items just like household laser printers, rather than high-tech products far from folks.


 Why so inexpensive

You may wonder why such a good product is at such a low price. It might even seem incredible to you, as overall the 3D printers on market is a bit expensive. You may once wish you could have a low-cost 3D printer, and so did us. But now we dare say that it has become reality. Ares is just for you, really cost-effective and highly extendable. However, low-cost doesn’t necessarily mean poor quality. Actually, if interested in Ares, you should read our story slowly and carefully, then you will think Ares is of high quality. Honestly, we have to admit that we couldn’t make it without several advantages.
1. Open-source
Our design is based on open-source, both in terms of software and firmware. It is our full use of the creativity from all over the world that saves the time and cost during the development.
2. Made in China
You probably have known something about “Made in China”, as the product manufacturing is highly developed in China. “Made in China” makes the most contribution to manufacturing good products by skilled workers yet with much lower labor costs.
3. To gain visibility
In fact, the price is almost at the cost of our products. Our aim of this campaign is to raise the awareness of public that most of you can afford 3D printers. It is no longer a high-tech product. As a start-up company for 3D printing, quality is the key to survival. So we worry more about the quality of Ares than you.


 Why should choose Ares

1. Full-metal Body: Say no to deformation
Metal body is a major feature of Ares, along with black exterior, making it low profile and steady, but also luxurious. Moreover, more than 90% of the load-bearing parts are made by metal and processed by CNC. In addition, the driving belt is made of polyurethane and steel wire to avoid deformation. It is worth mentioning that the full-metal body contributes to minimize the gap between the parts, and thus to prevent any possible distortion during printing. Therefore, the printed parts present extremely smooth
surfaces, surpassing the apparent staircase effect in other hot-melt printers.


2. Modular Design: Unlimited extension of your imagination
Modular design enables users greater space for extension. As the core of this printer, the switchable platform plays a vital role. It allows users to take advantage of the reserved holes on it to adapt various nozzles, like laser transmitters, CNC cutters and so on. Besides, the aviation aluminum alloy connector, processed by surface adonization and CNC, is the privilege accessory for Ares to meet multi-functional connections. Most of all, you can design your own connectors to adapt your extended tools. The function of your 3D printer can be instantly upgraded and converted, as long as the adapter or connector matches the reserved holes. In addition, with up to 15 ports, the aerial socket for wiring provides possibilities for unlimited upgrade.


3. Commercially Open-source: Be support technician yourself
We know that many people worry about the technical support and warranty. Indeed, it will spend too much time and money for you and us if something wrong happens to Ares after delivery. So we will always get Ares completely checked before shipping. We have tested our prototypes everyday for over 4 months, it still works very well. We can guarantee that the overall structure is stiff and durable, like the motors, gears, linear guide-way, joint, PCB boards, driving belt and so on.
However, like most products, there exists vulnerable parts like print nozzle. For both of your and our convenience, we will publish the details of currently commercially available parts in our user manual. In this way, you can renew most of the broken parts yourself. Of course you can email us your problem and we will surely give you technical support. We hope this (commercially open-source) can help you and us address most of your problem during daily creation.



 What makes Ares outstanding
1. 3D printing: Colorful, complex and even tiny
Similar to many other 3D printers, PLA filaments is the main consume materials in terms of 3D printing function, as it is both friendly to human and environment. So of course you can make colorful and complex 3D samples and even products. Particularly, the minimized gap between the moving parts significantly prevents apparent staircase effect on the surface of printed models. Surprisingly, Ares can print tiny model even smaller than finger. (Models are from Thingiverse)
  



2. Laser engraving: Essential tool for DIY makers
As laser engraving is very popular to DIY makers, Ares series are also equipped with laser engraving kits. In consideration of practicality and safety, we think 300mW power will be enough for daily DIY. For instance, you can engrave your logo or picture on a card, leather, or wood, and even cut the paper into your design. Worried about the precision? Just scan the 2D code below and see what happens on Wechat or Facebook.
 


3. CNC engraving (under development): 3D pictures
In view of practicality and safety, the CNC engraving kit for Ares consists of a motor (maximum speed - 4000 rpm/min) and milling cutters of various sizes for corn. So now 3D pictures are available for you by engraving patterns on the cork and wood. Besides, you can design arbitrarily complex 3D models to form your exclusive wooden carvings in relief.


4. 3D Scanning: Much more creation and extension
3D scanning, or 3D reversion, just makes your creation and extension simpler and easier. With laser line scanners, and high-definition cameras, Ares can deal with most of daily objects very well in high resolution. The design of quick setup makes 3D scanner portable and efficient for installation. In addition, you have many options to output the results, making it more convenient for modification and much more practical in DIY.






5. WiFi Access: So close to Ares

The Raspberry-Pi, an open source hardware built in Ares, is the central processing unit, much like the brain that controls Ares. Thanks to the support of WiFi, Raspberry-Pi makes it possible to achieve remote control and monitoring of your printer just by following our simple instruction and configuration, much easier than ever before. Surprisingly, you even may need't purchase a monitor for this function, just unplug the webcam from your computer instead, if available. It is especially convenient for office workers like you and me, isn't it?


6.More functions can be added: Unlimited
The functions of Ares 3D printer are not limited to what mentioned above. All of our designs and developments are based on open source firmware and software. As we all know, good quality is the precondition of extension. So we are trying our best to make sure Ares is competent for extension, like metal body, linear guide, aluminum CNC parts and so on. Not only that, you are greatly encouraged to develop your own modules by following our instructions. The standard of your connector or adapter has been defined in the user manual, so that your own design can match the switchable platform. As long as following this rule, chocolate printing, circuit board, any feasible extension is possible.

 Timeline





 EasyArts team

During his PhD research at SC3DP (Singapore Center of 3D Printing, the biggest 3D printing laboratory in Asia), Shuai Li thought that 3D printers should not be the exclusives for laboratory, but also should be common products at low price to bring convenience for the folks with powerful functions. Soon after, he managed to establish a team aimed for this idea, called EasyArts, and now is the president of it. In EasyArts, the other members have the same idea and all agree with his leadership.
This is a professional team, consisting of three PhD researchers majored in 3D printing and lots of experienced engineers, skilled in either electrical & electronic, machanical, product engineering, computing technology , or marketing management. It is also a team of high efficiency, owing to the support of the business incubator of Wuhan ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute) of Geo-Resources and Environment Co., Ltd.
Finally, with the joint efforts of all team members and the leadership of Shuai and Xin, we finished the development of such an awesome product, that is, Ares All-in-one 3D Printer. In addition with complete supply chain and excellent capacity for mass production, we are able to ensure Ares can be put on your desk on time.

Core team members


Brief introduction
Shuai Li is the president and a developer in EasyArts. His execution, researching ability and spirit is overwhelming. Most of his inspiration on Ares profits from his research work at SC3DP, and his PhD experience gives him great courage and perseverance to overcome the difficulties during the development of Ares. We can completely immodestly say that he is an expert on 3D printing.
Xin Li is a competent manager due to his master's degree in business (MBA). On account of strong career passion and sharp market insights, he is actually the adviser on what functions of Ares are needed and how much is affordable to most people. So it is his considerable experience in marketing that provides guidance for the development of Ares.
Pengju Xue, majored in Mechanical Engineering related to 3D printing, is especially experienced in machinery design. He is the director of the mechanical structure design of Ares, as he can always come up with clever institutions to integrate all kinds of spare parts. So most of what you can see on Ares comes from his idea and inspiration. We are lucky to have such developer.
Guiru Zhu is a seasoned engineer. He is worthy of it because he once worked as a mechanical engineer for over 10 years. When he heard of EasyArts, he decided to leave his current job of high salary, since he also agrees that 3D printing is promising and why not be the common product just like household laser printer. Specifically, he made the most contributions to optimize the mechanical design.
Zhichao Chen was Shuai's classmate  during the period of both undergraduate and postgraduate. No wander he is another core member of EasyArts and the most ardent supporter. The same major and similar interests makes them maintain a high level of understanding in the development of Ares. Currently, he is responsible for the software development because of his programming skills.
Weidong Li, similar to Guiru, also quit his high-paying job in Beijing to join EasyArts. And now he takes charge of electrical & electronic module. He is regarded as a man with strong mastermind power. Just imagine how difficult and complex it is to integrate of so many functions into such limited space and circuit. Finally he made it, because of his hard-working and his professional competence as well.
Yuqian Zhang really stood out  other schoolgirls when she was an undergraduate. You know what? She spent her spare time in the library to learn product engineering and technology, which is nothing to do with her major. After several years of work as product engineer at Singapore, she achieved considerable experience on product engineering.
Hongyu Tian is particularly good at algorithm and optimization. We would say that he is a high-quality comprehensive talent, as he made lots of efforts and contributions to the mechanical design, software development and product engineering. It is hard to say when Ares could be available for release without his optimization. He is the one who first thought of applying Raspberry-Pi to Ares.


 Acknowledgement

Firstly we would like to thank the firmware made by Marlin, as well as many other open source projects by Octopi, Cura and Freelss and the persons who share their design on Thingvierse. It is the spirit of open source that pushes 3D printing forward a great deal, and that brings more people into the world of 3D. Consistent with such spirit, our design documents and relative software will be open source on delivery.

Then the special thanks will be given to the business incubator of Wuhan ITRI of Geo-Resources and Environment Co., Ltd.

 Risks and challenges

1. Supply chain and logistics
No one wants to see a good idea being executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to prepare mass production for Ares, but we still face several challenges. Currently, many suppliers have been secured for the components. The remaining issue is to set up warehouses for the production line. That's why we are constantly working with specialists of supply chain to establish a production line of high efficiency and reliability. The challenge is obvious as we must make sure the delivery of this amazing can be arranged as soon as possible. Delivery of rewards/perks is subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.
2. Shipping
Shipping costs vary with your country and specific location. To reduce the cost of Ares at the maximum, we decide to charge the shipping costs separately, also for the sake of fairness. After the campaign, we will send you a survey by email to collect your basic contact details like name, address for delivery. Of course you can decide your own option for shipping. However, shipping is another risk which might be out of our control during delivery. So it is recommended that we choose the best shipping option for you, based on your location. According to your option, we will charge extra with the exact costs for shipping. We will arrange the shipment only after your payment has been confirmed. If you want to know how much it will cost, please contact us at easyarts@126.com.


 Frequently asked questions

Please read the FAQs below carefully before claim. If you cannot find what you are satisfied with or interested in, don't hesitate to contact us at easyarts@126.com.

Q1: Why it shows free shipping when I claim the perk, while actually shipping not included?

EasyArts: Okay, good question. We do apologize for this conflict. As you know, shipping fee for worldwide is various, so we cannot determine how much the shipping will cost. Indiegogo does NOT support various settings for shipping, so the default fee has to be $0, thus resulting in ""free shipping"". Shipping is NOT included for ""Assembled ARES 3D Printer"". Please refer to the ""Risks and challenges"" section for more details about shipping.

Q2:Why the price of three optional modules is different from each other?

EasyArts: Really good point. Many people may be wondering what is the price difference of our three optional modules, which is the same during previous campaign. Actually, if you read the description of these perks, you may realize some difference, that is, ""Shipping HAS BEEN included"". So that is the source of price difference. In other words, CNC costs most while Laser costs least in terms of shipping. We believe this will bring you and us greater convenience, as both of us can just care about the shipping fee of ARES. To put it another way, you won't worry how much it will cost for optional modules, which has been included.
Q3: How can you know which module(s) I have claimed without any comments?
EasyArts: Good question. Of course you can inform us at easyarts@126.com about your desired module(s) if you like. Actually, after this campaign, we will contact all of the supporters (contribute $399 or more) to confirm your module(s), no matter you have informed us or not. So don't worry about your module(s). If we still haven't got your confirmation before shipment, you will receive sequential module(s) (LASER ENGRAVING -> 3D SCANNING -> CNC ENGRAVING), so that you won't get same module(s) for a perk.

Q4: What if there is no available WiFi access? Can this printer work off-line?

EasyArts: WiFi or Internet access is our featured function for Ares in view of convenience, but NOT required. So you can still use the printer as long as you have a computer. Just connect your PC and 3D printer by the data cable we provide (2 meters long), your Ares will be able to work.
Q5: Do I have to install a specific software or app to control the printer?
EasyArts: No, the control system of Ares has already been installed inside the printer. And we offer a much more convenient option for Ares, that is, telnetting into the printer through browser. Please refer to the user's manual for the specific operation. In this way, you can gain control of Ares provided that you have a browser, no matter what kind of OS you use, for instance, Windows, Mac Os, Linux and Android.
Q6: Do I have to prepare specific formatted files for laser engraving or CNC milling function?
EasyArts: No special files are required for the laser engraving or CNC milling function. A self-developed software can help you deal with JPG/BMP files. We are glad to inform you that the software will be FREE if you claim ANY ONE of the perk except ""Friendly Sponsorship"".
Q7: Is it necessary to calibrate the platform before printing?
EasyArts: Normally NOT. Calibration of the platform is required ONLY when the location of your printer has been changed. In addition, the printer supports automatic calibration, which has been built inside, so don't worry about this if you have to calibrate the platform.
Q8: What is the resolution of the scanner? What if I want to scan/reverse colorful objects?
EasyArts: The available resolution is greater than or equal to 0.3 mm. The HD scanner and camera supports colorful mode, so your scanned models will also in similar color. Please refer to the specification section for more parameters of 3D scanning. Thank you.
Q9: What is the consume material for printing? Do I have to buy it from EasyArts?
EasyArts: Currently the main material for 3D printing function is PLA. It is expected that other various materials will be supported through extensions as well in the near future, for example, high-melting-point plastic (carbon fiber, nylon, graphene etc.). PLA is quite common now, we do offer perks for our contributors, but it is not a must to buy it from us. In fact, we will offer some free PLA (1kg) to improve your experience of Ares.
Q10: I am a DIY maker, can I develop my own module(s)?
EasyArts: Of course. Actually, this printer is for designers and DIY makers. The switchable platform is designed for such extensions. So we really encourage you to do this. Just follow the instructions and the standard for your adapter(s) / connector(s), which will be released after this campaign, you will find it quite easy to develop your own module(s). Go ahead for your imagination and creation.
Q11: I am a journalist, can I report the story about your team and your 3D printer?
EasyArts: You are mostly welcomed. Thank you for your willingness to help us popularize EasyArts and Ares. Don't hesitate to contact us at easyarts@126.com.
Q12: Do you need any distributors for this 3D printer? Is there any requirement to be your distributors?
EasyArts: Yes, any distributors interested in our product are warmly welcomed all around the world. We prefer to work together with you to generalize 3D printing technology. As for the requirements, we would like to say totally NO right now, so long as you want to join us. In addition, as our distributors, you will get professional training for the promotion of this printer for FREE. If you have such intention. please contact us at easyarts@126.com.",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

invite you to visit our website and welcome any questions or feedback from you. </p>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before starting out on the creation and programming phase we
introduced our concept to a broad audience through our blog. We gathered information from motorists, bike riders, daily commuters, and many more. We wanted their feedback and input. This insightful and  real world information gave us even more insight and focus on the kind of technology we
wanted to create. Our goal is to create an very intuitive and simple to use
application for both automobile drivers and motorcycle riders. </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>From our F.A.Q page</h3>
<p><b><i></i></b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i></i></b></p><p><b>Question</b>: What happens
if there is more than one motorcycle in my area, while I'm driving around in my car?</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;""></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Answer</b>: Each motorcycle rider app will generate its own identification code,
position, direction,  and velocity-mph.
The V2V app in the car will be able to detect multiple motorcycles at any
given time. If there are three motorcycles in the area, V2V will identify, classify, and generate a status icon on all
three depending on their proximity and relativity to the automobile’s direction of travel. V2V will continually monitor all three motorcycles and update their status until
they are out of alert range.  The automobile driver will receive
the alerts and status at the times when the V2V was triggered; one motorcycle at a
time or all at once depending on the scenario. In either case, the automobile
driver will have the option to simply reset the V2V app with one touch, or let
the alerts time out naturally. The <b>key factor is to let the driver be aware</b> that
there are one or more motorcycles in the area, so be alert!

<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Given the current mobile device
market, we want to give our customers a high-quality app on the top three
platforms: Android, iOS and Windows Phone. However, designing and building apps
across these platforms can lead to a myriad of challenges, among them the need
to reconcile the unique native languages of each platform while creating an
elegant, intuitive and consistent user experience.</p>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To meet the needs of this complex
reality, we chose a development technology that addresses both operational and
strategic objectives. Currently, there are three options: build native apps
specific to devices, use HTML5 to build web-based apps, or adopt a platform
approach.</p>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We also needed to consider the full life cycle

<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Appcelarator Titanium is our platform of choice. This
platform approach will allow us to serve a full customer base — not just
one segment with a specific device. This ensures greater adoption by
having a single code base that can be updated when new features, functions,
devices, or operating systems are rolled out. The days of one or two devices
covering a large majority of users are likely behind us. Instead of fewer
devices, we will see more volume, variety, and more complexity. V2V Technology will need to run not only on phones but on newer wearable
technologies like glasses and watches to increasingly smarter and more flexible
devices. We want to stay ahead of the curve with V2V Technology. Our users
will demand the information and capabilities they want, when and where they
need it. V2V Technology will provide this for the long term. We want to:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><b style=""text-align: justify; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">Create an

special form of augmented reality. The displayed information is integrated into
the external environment in the correct perspective and at the actual point or
points in the scene to which it relates, so that effectively the information
appears to be “attached” to the external objects. Contact analogue displays
have many advantages. The fact that the information is presented in the
driver’s direct line of sight, and that it is overlaid on the objects it is
referring to, means that the driver does not have to shift his attention away
from the driving scene. His gaze is not distracted and he does not have to
change focus, as he does when looking back from an instrument cluster or
central information display to the road. This means that information relevant
to the driving situation can be scanned more quickly and more directly. At the

<p></p></div>","Hi, 
We are V2V Technology and we are creating a new mobile application that may help save lives. Have you ever known
anyone who has been involved in a serious motorcycle collision? We have, and that was the catalyst and
light bulb moment when we started looking into motorcycle safety issues in
early 2013. The deeper we researched, the more inspired and committed we
became to finding a way to fight back the alarming trend of serious injuries
and fatalities on our roads involving motorcycles and
automobiles.
           The statistics for 2013 from the GHSA will be out in June 2014 and
the upward trend of serious injuries and fatalities is expected to continue. Add on
the increasing number of motorized *scooters on the road, which are not
accounted for in these reports and you can clearly see where this trend is
going.
""We are seeing more
people riding scooters in heavy traffic. You couple that with their lack of
experience and motorists not sharing the road or seeing the scooter, and it's a
recipe for tragedy and death,"" said Mike Stout, director of traffic safety.

Our young drivers are the key to the
future of Motorcycle Safety - already attuned to new technologies
Implementing
new methodologies of safe driving behavior, inclusive of motorcycle
awareness-every time they get behind the wheel
Getting
them involved from the very start through their first few years behind the
wheel will promote safer driving habits for the long term
These
methodologies together with new technologies like V2V, will create a new
generation of responsible young drivers 
Young
drivers will have the largest impact on the future of highway safety for both motorcycle
riders and motorists alike
http://federalregister.gov/a/2013-00682, and on FDsys.gov:     
This 200
page document which includes measures to decrease the amount of accidents, and
fatalities including and involving motorcycles on our roads, nationwide. (145) (c) includes marketing
and educational efforts to enhance motorcyclists awareness.
I have to admit I have not seen any of these
measures in place, and few if any of the ""marketing and educational efforts"". Slogans
are merely slogans if they do not affect real changes in the way people think
and act. We had to find a way to do more and we have! 
     Our Vision – Our Mission
Vehicle-to-vehicle
communications moved one step closer to reality this week with the Obama
administration’s plans to push the technology forward. The February 3rd announcement outlines a
set of proposed rules would be announced for comment by the time this
administration departs in 2017, with hopes that sometime around 2020,
cars will communicate with each other and alert drivers to roadside hazards
ahead. 
Recent Reports from the CES (Consumer
Electronics Show) by several auto manufacturers were clear about the
challenges of reaching and excepting a standard for The Automotive Industry as
a whole - 2020 or beyond is the consensus. There will also be the financial logistics involved in getting a
modular-antenna (wifi-device based) products into the market in a reasonable period
of time. The wheels of government turn very slowly.
Last
and certainly not least the monetary interest of giant corporations in getting a
stronghold and the lion’s share of the market first. Left in the hands of governmental agencies
and tied with private corporate interests; in today’s political climate in
Washington it seems they have a hard time just getting out of their own way. 
Our
goal is to take the reins and put this technology in the hands of as many
motorists and motorcyclists as quickly and as efficiently as we can. We
will offer our V2V technology for just a few dollars to make it affordable
to everyone. At the current rate of yearly fatalities, by 2020 we will have
lost another 30,000 plus people on our roads involving motorcycle
accidents. We find this tragic and unacceptable. We
the people, have the power - the commitment and the technology available to make
a difference now.  ResearchWe began our research focused on 
the  pre-existing technology in this field over the past 
two decades. The majority were primarily various forms of electronic
and radio frequency based devices. They all required some method of mechanical  installation on both the automobile and the motorcycle;
all proved to be too costly for both the manufacturers and the
public. With our gratitude and all due respect to the people who
engineered these products. Their past work gave us a very sound, detailed, and
focused basis on which to build our own technology.V2V Technology 
 V2V is a mobile  application designed to
alert the automotive vehicle driver when one or more motorcycles are approaching
and/or are in the vicinity of the automobile. The driver of the
vehicle will be made aware of one or more approaching motorcycles from any direction and at multiple distances.
A motorcycle rider with an active V2V app. will transmit its position, velocity- mph, direction of travel, status, path history, path prediction, and a
unique identification code to all automobile
drivers who have an active V2V app within a specified range or geofence and  divided into 3-zones known as the ""Alert Zones"". V2V uses (vehicle to vehicle) dedicated, location aware and context aware, enhanced GPS based communications in combination with our proprietary technology AGC advanced geofencing capabilities This technology  provides a 360-degree view of all vehicles equipped with V2V Technology within communication range. Multiple  indicators called Alert zones are  used by V2V Technology to help prevent crashes. They are GPS position, speed-mph, acceleration, direction, status,  path history, and path prediction.The V2V app in the automobile
will receive the information sent out by the motorcycle and calculate
if a motorcycle is in a certain specified range called the “Alert  Zones”. If a motorcycle enters the highest alert zone called the “Threat Zone”, the V2V app in the
automobile will alert the driver via specific color GPS icons - plus a pulse-tone for immediate threats.
When a  motorcycle enters the ""Threat Zone"", the V2V app generates a red icon and pulse-tone. As the motorcycle gets closer
and is x number of meters away, the red icon indicator will signal a clear threat, allowing the driver time to react accordingly. The
automobile driver can then reset the V2V app. After reset, if the same motorcycle is still in the threat zone, the light/pulse indicator will
have a dimmed icon and sound will be off. After a specified time, if the same
motorcycle is still in threat range, the V2V app will alert the driver once
more. V2V will continue to monitor until the motorcycle is out of the Alert  Zones.
V2V has three alert zones: Green, Yellow, and Red. All are
based on proximity or distance from the automobile driver. The green icon represents a motorcycle identified as a low alert status. If this motorcycle begins to pick up speed and moves closer to the automobiles path, it will then be identified as a yellow or mid alert status. And if necessary, the motorcycle will be identified as a red or high alert status nearing the threat zone.
The zones can be preset  for various distances to suit each individual drivers needs such as, cities with higher traffic volumes to more rural areas where there is less
traffic on the roads.   V2V: ""Your Extra Eyes On The Road""   Over
52% of accidents involving motorcycles and automobiles are right of way
violations by automobile drivers. Motorcycles are often moving fast and are
hard to see. Disaster can strike in a blink of an eye on our roads.
There are many questions you may be asking yourself as to how  V2V Technology functions. On our website www.V2Vtechnologyteam.com, we have addressed several of these
questions in our Technology and Features Pages and our F.A.Q. page. We
invite you to visit our website and welcome any questions or feedback from you. 
Before starting out on the creation and programming phase we
introduced our concept to a broad audience through our blog. We gathered information from motorists, bike riders, daily commuters, and many more. We wanted their feedback and input. This insightful and  real world information gave us even more insight and focus on the kind of technology we
wanted to create. Our goal is to create an very intuitive and simple to use
application for both automobile drivers and motorcycle riders. From our F.A.Q page
Question: What happens
if there is more than one motorcycle in my area, while I'm driving around in my car?Answer: Each motorcycle rider app will generate its own identification code,
position, direction,  and velocity-mph.
The V2V app in the car will be able to detect multiple motorcycles at any
given time. If there are three motorcycles in the area, V2V will identify, classify, and generate a status icon on all
three depending on their proximity and relativity to the automobile’s direction of travel. V2V will continually monitor all three motorcycles and update their status until
they are out of alert range.  The automobile driver will receive
the alerts and status at the times when the V2V was triggered; one motorcycle at a
time or all at once depending on the scenario. In either case, the automobile
driver will have the option to simply reset the V2V app with one touch, or let
the alerts time out naturally. The key factor is to let the driver be aware that
there are one or more motorcycles in the area, so be alert! Driver safety is all about awareness.   Excellent question, and many others were answered and helped us further our development of V2V technology.   Creation - Development - Allocation of Funds
Given the current mobile device
market, we want to give our customers a high-quality app on the top three
platforms: Android, iOS and Windows Phone. However, designing and building apps
across these platforms can lead to a myriad of challenges, among them the need
to reconcile the unique native languages of each platform while creating an
elegant, intuitive and consistent user experience.
To meet the needs of this complex
reality, we chose a development technology that addresses both operational and
strategic objectives. Currently, there are three options: build native apps
specific to devices, use HTML5 to build web-based apps, or adopt a platform
approach.
We also needed to consider the full life cycle
of our V2V app, not just the development stage. Planning for long-term
governance, data security, and enterprise integration were also key factors in
choosing a development methodology.                  
Appcelarator Titanium is our platform of choice. This
platform approach will allow us to serve a full customer base — not just
one segment with a specific device. This ensures greater adoption by
having a single code base that can be updated when new features, functions,
devices, or operating systems are rolled out. The days of one or two devices
covering a large majority of users are likely behind us. Instead of fewer
devices, we will see more volume, variety, and more complexity. V2V Technology will need to run not only on phones but on newer wearable
technologies like glasses and watches to increasingly smarter and more flexible
devices. We want to stay ahead of the curve with V2V Technology. Our users
will demand the information and capabilities they want, when and where they
need it. V2V Technology will provide this for the long term. We want to:Create an
amazing app experience across multiple operating systems and devices from a
single code base
Mobilize any
data source, public or enterprise
Test our app
faster with improved quality and control

Gain end-to-end
visibility into test coverage, API usage, user experience, app adoption and
performance



Currently we are in the wire frame phase with our
developer. Creating the graphics, features, and interface usability focusing on
ease-of-use. The next step is live prototyping and fully integrated automated testing; Working closely with our designers and developers. A
collaborative and cohesive effort to build V2V Technology as a truly
innovative app at mobile speed.
This
is where ninety percent of the funds raised will be allocated. The remaining
ten percent will be dedicated to: 

Brand development
Social media marketing
Creative services
Integrated media services

Public relations and public awareness campaigns
coordinated with state and national  public traffic safety organizations

       Timeline to a Successful Launch For 

                        V2V   1.0







A. Wireframe- Planning & Prototyping – After achieving a  clear vision  of our  V2V app solution. Our developers will produce the required documentation and other
tangibles (PRD, prototypes and interactive mockups, development options,
including API integrations, client-server architectures, third-party
implementations, administrative features), which will serve as a premise for
further development, allowing us to prove our concept and envision future
scalability of our mobile V2V app 1.0.

B. Deployment & Testing –
Armed with pre-development deliverables, V2V Technology developers will set
to translating documented requirements into a compelling mobile solution; while
our developer's Quality Assurance team will make sure that it performs
flawlessly across a variety of target devices with different form factors and
provides the same great experience at the myriad of mobile view ports available
in the mobile market today.

C. Analysis & Optimization –
The third step is to evaluate our mobile
app performance, get feedback from our users and spot new opportunities to improve
and enhance our mobile solution and set up an interactive optimization process
to engage our users and nurture their loyalty and trust with improved sets of
new functionality, features,  and
updates,  rolled out on a steady basis.

D. Completion & Rollout – With our V2V app ready to go live. Our developers will secure their efforts by deploying it
into our IT infrastructure and assisting V2V Technology with its release of
V2V app 1.0 to app stores, so that we can begin the initiative to make our
roads safer.

Future Technology Development – Stretch Goals

Mobile Device Screen
Casting -- Contact Analogue Display Technology 

Here at V2V
Technology Team we have been very careful not to put the cart ahead of the
horse with our technology development. Our main objectives are to deliver a
high quality app within our designated timeline and ensure long-term
governance, data security, and enterprise integration options moving forward in
order to provide timely, fully functional updates of V2V to our user base.  The data demands of V2V Technology will
continue to increase and keeping pace with growth and advancing technologies
through the life cycle of our V2V is paramount. 


       

We are excited
about the possibilities of integrating visual enhancement technologies with V2V.
We have opened channels of communication with other evolving technology developers in
the areas of mobile device screen casting. Translation: Your IOS,
Android, or Windows device can project the screen right on to the vehicles
windshield.  

Contact Analogue Display Technology - a
special form of augmented reality. The displayed information is integrated into
the external environment in the correct perspective and at the actual point or
points in the scene to which it relates, so that effectively the information
appears to be “attached” to the external objects. Contact analogue displays
have many advantages. The fact that the information is presented in the
driver’s direct line of sight, and that it is overlaid on the objects it is
referring to, means that the driver does not have to shift his attention away
from the driving scene. His gaze is not distracted and he does not have to
change focus, as he does when looking back from an instrument cluster or
central information display to the road. This means that information relevant
to the driving situation can be scanned more quickly and more directly. At the
same time, currently required actions can be displayed in an intuitive form.
Any and all funds above our
goal will be entirely allocated and directly focused into continued development
into these new emerging technologies to enhance the capabilities, features, and functions of V2V. Our
supporters will be kept informed on new V2V Technology developments and through continued app
updates moving forward.  
Thank you from your friends at V2V Technology Team.John Alvarez - Technical Director

<p> PictureCrazy and FreezeFrame started as one of those “wouldn't it be nice if” moments. Our family was on vacation and were all posting our pictures to Facebook and Dad says, wouldn't it be nice if our vacation pictures could automatically be sent to a picture frame for us to enjoy back home. Well when we got home Dad went to all of our Facebook accounts. He tried to track down all the vacation pictures on our Facebook pages so he could download and add them manually to a picture frame. After about an hour of that Dad’s veins were popping out of his head with frustration. Surely he thought there must be an app for this as this process was tedious and anything but fun. To his surprise there were no apps out there for creating dynamic albums from multiple Facebook user’s accounts. Dad being a seasoned entrepreneur saw this not only as a family business opportunity but also as an opportunity to teach his kids hands on about the entrepreneurial process. Our family has worked together on PictureCrazy and FreezeFrame from conception, to product design and functionality to writing the technical specifications, working with the developers and R&amp;D.  </p>
<h1>Open Source Technology</h1>
<p>FreezeFrame is built on Android, an open source operating system technology and we want to keep this spirit alive. We know that untied we can offer a better product and welcome the communities input on how we can make PictureCrazy and FreezeFrame even better! We will be offering an API for users and partners to plug into our SmartFrame aggregation engine as well as being able to integrate with our FreezeFrame firmware.

We will then let users vote on the best ideas and will address the ideas in the order of popularity. If you do not want to wait for this process or you have an idea on a partnership and you would like to get started ASAP. We will have a Partners Backers Pledge to secure your position for this. Please  email us at info@picturecrazy.com first before pledging on this to make sure your idea is feasible both economically and functionality wise. We look forward to hearing all of your ideas!</p>
<h1><b>Beyond The $150,000 Goal</b></h1>
<p>Reaching our goal of $150K is just the beginning! With your help in spreading the word about our Indiegogo project we would like to make FreezeFrame even cooler than it already is, with more options and functions listed below.

So let's make it happen!</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We want everybody out there on Indiegogo to be 100% confident that we will deliver on our promises. This is not a pipe dream or some quirky idea we just dreamt up and thought we would post to see if anybody was interested in backing.

We have done our homework and know what our costs are down to the postage stamp to send you your FreezeFrame including the sales tax we will need to pay . Every penny we raise will be put towards honoring our commitment to you our backers. Not some fancy office to show off, or a bunch of nonsense like that. So please back our project so we can send you your very own FreezeFrame!</p>

UPDATE 2 Please see our launch party testimonials from people that have seen FreezeFrame in action!
FreezeFrame Utilizes SmartFrame Push/Pull Technology 
With our patent pending SmartFrame Technology you can Push Pictures to your FreezeFrame from your Facebook app on your mobile device via your normal Facebook posts and updates.
FreezeFrame can also Pull Pictures from Facebook and surprise you throughout the day with new photos of your favorite friends, loved ones and even pictures from your favorite fan pages! After you complete the simple setup (2-3 min) FreezeFrame now does all the work of keeping your photos up to date! No more excuses for old out dated pictures on your Digital Picture Frame!



FreezeFrame displays photos in either landscape or portrait modes and has several picture layouts to choose from. (showing standard on the left and collage 1 on the right)


FreezeFrame Works With Your Facebook App On Your Mobile Device! See it in Action Below

Gone are the days of copying pictures to a disc or plugging in your digital photo frame to add new pictures! With FreezeFrame you can push pictures directly to the frame right from your Facebook App on your mobile device! No additional software or apps to install. Photos are pushed from Facebook status updates and picture posts to your FreezeFrame automatically. You can even send photos to your FreezeFrame(s) discreetly so only you and your FreezeFrame will have access to them.  

How FreezeFrame Works

FreezeFrame is brought to you by PictureCrazy and is an extension of their cutting edge Facebook photo streaming and screensaver apps. PictureCrazy works dynamically with Facebook letting you create your own custom photo albums from your Facebook pictures,  your friend’s Facebook pictures and even your favorite fan page pictures then turns them into a beautiful collage or slide show. Once your album(s) are created you can enjoy and share your album(s) via your social channels, email, browser and PictureCrazy custom screensaver apps for Mac and PC. Oh and did we mention that PictureCrazy.com is free :) To see a sample of a streaming album created by PictureCrazy from the Facebook pictures from the Indiegogo Facebook page click here, or better yet to create your own album for free go to PictureCrazy.com and login with Facebook and then click ""Create Album"".
FreezeFrame will take it a step further and allow you to seamlessly push your favorite Facebook memories to your very own Freezeframe and automatically display your favorite photos anyplace you would a normal picture frame.  Then imagine you and your friends and family reminiscing over your photos on your very own FreezeFrame.
Using your FreezeFrame couldn't be easier. Plug it in, log onto your Wi-Fi connection, register your frame with PictureCrazy.com , choose your pictures and albums. Then watch the magic happen as your pictures start appearing before your eyes on your FreezeFrame. That’s all there is to it, no clunky set up, no special apps or software, no cards or cables to plug into your computer. Just Set it and Forget it. From now on FreezeFrame does all the work of keeping your pictures updated.

So who’s a FreezeFrame Fanatic?
Everybody of course!  FreezeFrame is perfect for your friends, family, and yes, even grandma. Whether or not your grandma has a Facebook account or not, you can still get her a FreezeFrame and push your family photos to it for her to enjoy via WiFi. 



Grandparents Love FreezeFrame
Or imagine you go on vacation and leave the kids at home. You can have a Freezeframe for them that you can push all of your pictures to from your vacation destination. It's almost like they are there with you... Almost!

How to confirm whether the Laptop mate is compatible with your laptop? Please refer to the picture below, take out your laptop adapter, and check the underlining data in red color. If your output data is: 18V-21V 65W, then you will be able to use our product. If you cannot confirm whether this product is good for you, please tell us your laptop brand and model.

How the Funds will be Used



The funds raised will go towards tooling, purchasing of raw materials, production, and shipping. We have finalized the design, qualified and selected our manufacturer, and have even completed basic tooling. Production will begin in October.






Production Plan



Our product has passed most of the quality certifications, so the delivery time will be greatly shortened, allowing you to receive this product as soon as possible.



We've also completed a small production run in order to plan and prepare for every possible delay and problem that may occur throughout the manufacturing process. However with any project, unanticipated obstacles may arise and we will be transparent and open about any hurdles that come up and constantly keep our backers updated.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

eCozy is a water-radiator thermostat that is practical in everyday-usage and beautiful. The only heating solution that can finally become a visual improvement of your home.

A thermostat you don't want to hide.We shaped the forms and worked with different materials, so that it fits perfectly in every environment: from a modern, contemporary studio or office, to a cozy cabin, somewhere in the Norwegian woods. 
 

 
What’s behind the form? 
eCozy was created to help you save. Period.
 

cut your heating bill by almost 30%
save worlds resources (consume less energy)
optimize heating patterns & costs


 


 
 
We said it: with eCozy we aim to be part of the global initiative for energy saving.
There is no need to heat an empty home! eCozy will prevent you from doing that. 
Thanks to special energy-saving heating algorithms you will not only save almost 30% of your annual heating bill*, but also forget the pain of adjusting your thermostat each time you want to leave the house: eCozy will know that you’re away as soon as you left your apartment!
*according to International Energy Agency (IEA): an average yearly heating bill in Germany amounted to 1800 EUR for a 90-100 m² apartment in 2013.

 
In October 2014, eCozy’s heating algorithms were recognized as innovative by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology.
 

Smart algorithms that were developed to serve one purpose: to help you save. 
 
 eCozy Heating Solution consists of three components: Thermostat, App & Central Unit (CU), that serves as a control hub for all eCozy thermostats in your home.
 


 
We want to highlight the simplicity and usefulness of eCozy. And if people share our passion for the product – we will receive feedback for further product attributes.
 


The benefits of an eCozy Smart Heating Solution:
 

empowers you with advanced smart home features
greatly improves your energy saving
looks modern and is extremely easy to use

 
Let's take a look at some of the features: remote control at first.
 

You can access your home heating with the eCozy App - no matter where you are!
No need to freeze - heat up your rooms, before coming home from a winter’s walk.

Pssst! We want to share it with you: Apple Watch support will be provided as well.


Effective heating algorhythms - a feature that you will love! Choose a heating option for each of your rooms - eCozy already knows the perfect temperature.


Oh! The Central Unit can easily serve as a cozy lighting solution for your room.

 
 

Place it vertically or horizontally - it will suit your apartment perfectly.
Currently one Central Unit supports up to 15 thermostats. 
And there is only one rule to remember: one eCozy thermostat per each water radiator. If you have 3 water radiators at home - you need the eCozy Comfort Kit (3T+CU). You can always buy as many additional thermostats as you need!

 
 

In this campaign we introduce the product with all its attributes and potential savings. We want to show that behind eCozy stands a passionate team.

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>This campaign and the project it self was created out of a necessity. I designed and prototyped a system called <a href=""http://www.os-rc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""OSRC"">OSRC</a> which is an <a href=""http://www.os-rc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""OSRC"">Open Source Remote Control</a> for UAV, Helicopter, Airplane and many other models. However, due to the complexity of the system and a pretty low budget left after its creation, manufacturing parts for the project through 3D printing was the only solution realistic enough. I never thought that i would be building my own 3D printer since there are many solutions already available that create 3D models out of extruded plastic or even SLA printers that can produce amazing results.</p>
<p>After many days of research and quote requests from suppliers of these amazing systems it became clear that the equipment i need to do my own production was too expensive based on my specs and the ones already available, low cost DLP printers were although great in their own right, build small areas and are far from the accuracy i needed.</p>
<p><img alt=""Explanation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.os-rc.com/images/general_articles/indiegogo_3dprinter/feature_explanation.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p><strong>If you want to contribute to the cause directly or make a large contribution, please contact me directly though the<a href=""http://www.os-rc.com/contact-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""OSRC Contact""> </a><a href=""http://www.ilios3d.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ilios3d.com </a>website.</strong></p>
<p>Since my end goal is to actually use my 3D printer and build models on a daily basis, with end dimensions and results just as accurate as it appears on the design software, creating yet another copy with parts that are commonly used for DIY applications was not the way to go. I need something that can be as rigid as possible, use the most accurate and reliable hardware available and produce the same result every time. Imagine if you design a PCB and the clearance is even 0.1mm off when you try to fit it inside an enclosure. In a complex mechanical design, accuracy and reliability means everything. It is far cheaper to build something reliable rather than trying to tweak it for days and days, loosing time energy and not working on your original idea.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that there is no additional pricing to parts for any order since if i at least get 3 orders for the machine i can build the system for my self from spare parts and save on shipping for getting all required electronics and additional hardware.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><em>If you are interested in the OSRC system and claim the €20 or more perk, you get to be among the first to get the system when it is shipped since initial quantities shall be limited.</em></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Additionally, for those who get the Frame, Frame and mechanics or the full set shall NOT be charged for the OSRC system enclosure costs if they wish to purchase it once the product is released. Just don't forget to mention it once purchasing the system and the price shall be added the relative discount. I will also keep a record of all contributors for this purpose.</em><br/></strong></p>
<h3>What is different about this?</h3>
<p>There are <strong>4 main aspects</strong> that the Ilios 3D printer takes into account. <strong>Large Build Area, Rigid Construction, High Precision Components, Versatile &amp; Customizable Design.</strong></p>
<p>The main consideration for any low budget project is the price. Since i am an engineer, i can say with certainty that for the same price as an already available system i can build something better and fit it to my own purpose with parts and techniques which would allow for a reliable end result.</p>
<p><img alt=""SLA results printed by Rob Hopeless"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.os-rc.com/images/general_articles/indiegogo_3dprinter/bunny-sla.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;""/>In reality i am not reinventing the wheel here. DLP 3D printers have been around for a long time and there are great communities and even instructions on how to make your very own 3D printer. However, using parts that are as accurate as possible and outsourcing all the small details as well as putting it all together is quite different, especially if your specifications need to exceed what is available for a low budget.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The specifications which i require my self for day to day manufacturing and what the 3D printer can do are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Z axis completely Ball Screw driven on 2 separate slides</li>
<li>Z axis based on High Accuracy linear slides</li>
<li>Z axis driven on both ends for greater reliability</li>
<li>Z axis Repeat accuracy(not actual accuracy which is greater) less than 0.01mm on a length of 300mm</li>
<li>Maximum Build Area of 230mm(x) x 260mm(y) x 300mm(z)</li>
<li>Layer Thickness 12 microns (with a basic 200 step per revolution motor)</li>
<li>Movable Material VAT on a separate slide for tilt and removal</li>
<li>Room for up to 2 x 1080p DLP projectors for a Split-Screen result</li>
<li>All Aluminum frame and metal support construction</li>
</ul>
<p>In a system like this, the most important parts are the Z axis and the actual projection of the image. Since there are no more moving parts these two factors need to be as reliable and accurate as possible.</p>
<p><img alt=""Slide"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.os-rc.com/images/general_articles/indiegogo_3dprinter/Slide.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>There are many ways to actually make a sliding actuator and the most common is to use brass bearings and a shaft which in most cases is enough. In our case however the best solution is needed and ball bearing slides with a high accuracy shaft is the way to go. There are 3 slides in total on the machine. 2 slides are raising the platform for the Z axis and a third is actuating the material vat. The container with the material needs to slightly tilt every layer since the resin it self tends to stick after each curing cycle.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.os-rc.com/images/general_articles/indiegogo_3dprinter/Screw.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Besides the actual sliding mechanism you also need to move the platform. The common way to do this with accuracy is to use a screw spindle. However, basic spindles commonly used are just metal on plastic and even with a spring tensioned backlash assembly it is only accurate enough to a point. The spindles and their nuts i am using are Ball Bearing screw nuts with an internal greased assembly and can achieve a repeatability of 0.01mm with a pitch of 2.5mm.</p>
<p><img alt=""Aluminum frame"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.os-rc.com/images/general_articles/indiegogo_3dprinter/Frame.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>I live in Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean. In a city like Larnaca which is by the sea, humidity is a killer. Building machinery with wooden parts although is cheap, is not very reliable since the last thing i need is to worry about warping and general degradation. The entire frame of the printer is built with Aluminum extrusions and connected with steel screws and fittings specific for the extrusions them selves. The body is mainly constructed with 50mm x 50mm profiles and some smaller 25mm x 25mm parts for details of the construction.</p>
<h3>Electronics</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.os-rc.com/images/general_articles/indiegogo_3dprinter/3axis_probostep.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" title=""Motors""/>There are many stepper motor drivers and control boards out there but the ones i am using are high torque and have a high step count per revolution. Here are the specs of the elctronics in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 x NEMA 23, Dual Shaft, 1.8° /200 Steps Per Rev motors</li>
<li>3 x Unipolar Stepper motor driver boards</li>
<li>1 x Parallel Port Control board</li>
<li>1 x 24Volt 6.5Amp Switching Power Supply</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>I've made some good connections with manufacturers of UV and Light curing resins with properties such as Rubber, hard plastic and ABS. Below you shall find the materials that you can choose for your own application.</p>
<p><em><strong>Clear Resin for General Purposes</strong></em></p>
<ul>

<li>Low viscosity</li>
<li>Low irritation</li>
<li>No Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</li>
<li>High cure speed</li>
<li>Clear    </li>
<li>Elastic</li>
<li>Soft and Rubbery</li>
<li>Good surface cure</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above materials can be died into the following colors and produce opaque or transparent end results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black</li>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Green</li>
<li>Red</li>
<li>White (Only for opaque)</li>
<li>Yellow</li>
<li>Orange (only for transparent)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Projectors</h3>
<p>The <strong><em>TurnKey Solution</em></strong> perk includes a 1024x768 DLP projector, tested and ready for use. Since every one has their own specifications, it would be unreasonable to attach a high resolution projector to the machine. You can find projectors for about $200 - $300 on Ebay, which would be suited for 90% of all your applications. With comprehensive instructions and good support it shouldn't be hard to use any DLP projector with the 3D printer since the Base which is included with the frame can support most of them.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>No matter which perk you choose, whatever earnings i make are mainly concentrated on building a reliable machine for my self and use it for my own project while sharing the result with anyone who needs the same equipment. Since there may be a chance that more orders are made than my required budget, i shall be integrating a shop into the OSRC website with the equipment and options listed here as well as support the project (since i shall be working with it a lot).</p>
<p>Feel free to ask your questions in the <a href=""http://www.ilios3d.com/en/forum/index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Forum</a>, based on the <a href=""http://www.ilios3d.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ilios 3D website</a> or just send your queries through the campaign it self. I shall be more than happy to explain any details.</p>
<p><strong>Please have in mind that the prices listed in this campaign include only the parts cost and a small percentage to cover the expenses fees for the campaign it self as well as shipping and other details. These prices may change when the project becomes available in the shop so you are really getting a good deal as my initial goal is to actually make the system and use it and not to make profit from it.</strong></p>

Please note that there is no additional pricing to parts for any order since if i at least get 3 orders for the machine i can build the system for my self from spare parts and save on shipping for getting all required electronics and additional hardware.
If you are interested in the OSRC system and claim the €20 or more perk, you get to be among the first to get the system when it is shipped since initial quantities shall be limited.
Additionally, for those who get the Frame, Frame and mechanics or the full set shall NOT be charged for the OSRC system enclosure costs if they wish to purchase it once the product is released. Just don't forget to mention it once purchasing the system and the price shall be added the relative discount. I will also keep a record of all contributors for this purpose.
What is different about this?
There are 4 main aspects that the Ilios 3D printer takes into account. Large Build Area, Rigid Construction, High Precision Components, Versatile & Customizable Design.
The main consideration for any low budget project is the price. Since i am an engineer, i can say with certainty that for the same price as an already available system i can build something better and fit it to my own purpose with parts and techniques which would allow for a reliable end result.
In reality i am not reinventing the wheel here. DLP 3D printers have been around for a long time and there are great communities and even instructions on how to make your very own 3D printer. However, using parts that are as accurate as possible and outsourcing all the small details as well as putting it all together is quite different, especially if your specifications need to exceed what is available for a low budget.
 
The specifications which i require my self for day to day manufacturing and what the 3D printer can do are as follows:

Z axis completely Ball Screw driven on 2 separate slides
Z axis based on High Accuracy linear slides
Z axis driven on both ends for greater reliability
Z axis Repeat accuracy(not actual accuracy which is greater) less than 0.01mm on a length of 300mm
Maximum Build Area of 230mm(x) x 260mm(y) x 300mm(z)
Layer Thickness 12 microns (with a basic 200 step per revolution motor)
Movable Material VAT on a separate slide for tilt and removal
Room for up to 2 x 1080p DLP projectors for a Split-Screen result
All Aluminum frame and metal support construction

In a system like this, the most important parts are the Z axis and the actual projection of the image. Since there are no more moving parts these two factors need to be as reliable and accurate as possible.
There are many ways to actually make a sliding actuator and the most common is to use brass bearings and a shaft which in most cases is enough. In our case however the best solution is needed and ball bearing slides with a high accuracy shaft is the way to go. There are 3 slides in total on the machine. 2 slides are raising the platform for the Z axis and a third is actuating the material vat. The container with the material needs to slightly tilt every layer since the resin it self tends to stick after each curing cycle.
Besides the actual sliding mechanism you also need to move the platform. The common way to do this with accuracy is to use a screw spindle. However, basic spindles commonly used are just metal on plastic and even with a spring tensioned backlash assembly it is only accurate enough to a point. The spindles and their nuts i am using are Ball Bearing screw nuts with an internal greased assembly and can achieve a repeatability of 0.01mm with a pitch of 2.5mm.
I live in Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean. In a city like Larnaca which is by the sea, humidity is a killer. Building machinery with wooden parts although is cheap, is not very reliable since the last thing i need is to worry about warping and general degradation. The entire frame of the printer is built with Aluminum extrusions and connected with steel screws and fittings specific for the extrusions them selves. The body is mainly constructed with 50mm x 50mm profiles and some smaller 25mm x 25mm parts for details of the construction.
Electronics
There are many stepper motor drivers and control boards out there but the ones i am using are high torque and have a high step count per revolution. Here are the specs of the elctronics in detail.

3 x NEMA 23, Dual Shaft, 1.8° /200 Steps Per Rev motors
3 x Unipolar Stepper motor driver boards
1 x Parallel Port Control board
1 x 24Volt 6.5Amp Switching Power Supply

 
Materials
I've made some good connections with manufacturers of UV and Light curing resins with properties such as Rubber, hard plastic and ABS. Below you shall find the materials that you can choose for your own application.
Clear Resin for General Purposes

High Resolution
Low viscosity
Low irritation
Low odor
No Volatile Organic Compounds
Clear
High cure speed
High Hardness
Low Cost

Hard Resin for Durable applications

High resolution
Low viscosity
Low irritation
Low odor
No Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
High cure speed    
Opalescent
Extra high hardness
Extra high stiffness
Extra dimensional stability

Hard & Tough Resin for Mechanical Parts

High resolution
Low viscosity
Low irritation
Low odor
No Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
High cure speed
High Hardness    
Extra toughness
Extra impact resistance
Extra abrasion resistance
Extra durability
Clear
Extra dimensional stability
Extra flexing ability

Elastic Resin for Rubber Like Parts

High resolution
Low viscosity
Low irritation
No Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
High cure speed
Clear    
Elastic
Soft and Rubbery
Good surface cure

All the above materials can be died into the following colors and produce opaque or transparent end results.

Black
Blue
Green
Red
White (Only for opaque)
Yellow
Orange (only for transparent)

Projectors
The TurnKey Solution perk includes a 1024x768 DLP projector, tested and ready for use. Since every one has their own specifications, it would be unreasonable to attach a high resolution projector to the machine. You can find projectors for about $200 - $300 on Ebay, which would be suited for 90% of all your applications. With comprehensive instructions and good support it shouldn't be hard to use any DLP projector with the 3D printer since the Base which is included with the frame can support most of them.
Summary
No matter which perk you choose, whatever earnings i make are mainly concentrated on building a reliable machine for my self and use it for my own project while sharing the result with anyone who needs the same equipment. Since there may be a chance that more orders are made than my required budget, i shall be integrating a shop into the OSRC website with the equipment and options listed here as well as support the project (since i shall be working with it a lot).
Feel free to ask your questions in the Forum, based on the Ilios 3D website or just send your queries through the campaign it self. I shall be more than happy to explain any details.
Please have in mind that the prices listed in this campaign include only the parts cost and a small percentage to cover the expenses fees for the campaign it self as well as shipping and other details. These prices may change when the project becomes available in the shop so you are really getting a good deal as my initial goal is to actually make the system and use it and not to make profit from it.
Help me get my own project off the ground and start manufacturing parts for it as well as get a reliable piece of machinery in return.",6.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Yes, the whole internet!</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, the internet was a free place, where you could escape the burdens of real life and emerge yourself in your own little virtual world. Until one day, when censorship took over all of it, turning this safe haven into a space full of restrictions. All but one little firm located in Bucharest, Romania, which decided to fight against censorship and reboot the internet back to the safe place we all know and love.<br/><br/>And here we are: A start-up VPN firm called CyberGhost, and we were first founded because we wanted to give people an alternative. We wanted them to be able to free themselves of all internet restrictions, access blocked data and feel secure while doing it. Our company is already established and our product is used by many people, but unfortunately, we have a 1 GB traffic limitation in our free service. Why? Because we already pay for hundreds of terabytes of data and we have no ads or other annoying things there to get some money back. Right now the free service is co-financed by the subscribers of our paid premium network. But we think that there are a lot of people out there who need access to a free, fast and reliable VPN network. Our goal is to offer a free service without ads and with unlimited traffic and to provide more options to choose from when it comes to servers’ locations and the amount of IP addresses available for people who can’t afford a subscription in our paid network.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>If my question isn't answered here, how do I ask?</strong></p>
<p>Just email us – <a href=""mailto:support@cyberghost.ro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@cyberghost.ro</a></p>
<p><strong>When will my Perks be delivered?</strong></p>
<p>We will ship everything latest on the 31<sup>st</sup> January 2013. The perks consisting in e-mails and listing you on our Supported by page will be accomplished by the end of December. The 1 year CyberGhost subscription and also the lifetime CyberGhost subcriptions will each be delivered as soon as possible, which means immediatly after we got your donation and one of our colleagues has the time to send you the serial code (give us 24h to do that).</p>
<p><strong>Is there a charge for shipping outside the European Union?</strong></p>
<p>Only for the $50 perk an additional charge to ship outside the European Union is needed. Please add 10 $ for delivery outside the European Union. Please include that in the checkout price. If you forget, we'll contact you prior to shipping to finalize those details.</p>
<p>For all the perks over $50 we will ship your Ultimate Merchandise Package to the end of January 2013.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t hit your goal, will this mean that you won’t improve your Free VPN?</strong></p>
<p>If we don’t hit our goal, we will still improve what we can, by using the raised money. Have a look at our stretch-goals here:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we reach $25.000 we add servers in 3 countries (UK, France, USA)</li>
<li>If we reach $50.000 we add servers in 3 more countries (Brazil, India, Canada)</li>
<li>If we reach $75.000 we add servers in 3 more countries (Japan, Vietnam, Mexico)</li>
<li>If we reach $100.000 we offer our Free VPN without traffic limitation and add more servers (2.000 IPs) in more countries than the ones that were mentioned above</li>
</ul><p><strong>Will this mean that CyberGhost VPN Free will have more servers?</strong></p>
<p>If we raise the money, we will be able to pay for around 2.000 IP’s for a year. And we will make that pool available for both our Free and Paid service. We will rotate that IP-address pool, so that it takes around 6 months to run through the whole server pool. So some of them will be active to choose from, some of them will be in a waiting queue to “recover”. This will make it way harder for censors, content restrictors and other evil guys to block our IP range.</p>
<p><strong>Why Indiegogo? Why are you going with the Gogos?</strong></p>
<p>CyberGhost VPN is right now available all over the world –just like Indiegogo. We have users in America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Our company is founded by some Germans, but we are located in Bucharest, Romania. Right now, we speak eight different languages in our company and we are fans of that international family thing. So we decided for a platform that is available all over the world and supports PayPal and regular Credit Cards payments to make the audience for that campaign as wide as possible.</p>
<p><strong>One hundred thousand dollars seems to be a lot of money. Where is it all going?</strong></p>
<p>On  one side, we pay a lot of money for the traffic you guys generate. We don’t know what you’re doing there, but we pay for hundreds of Terabytes every month. Then we pay for the rent of our server park and our IP-address pool. And we also need to pay rent, wages, health insurance, utilities and all the normal stuff that you pay for when you have twenty Ghosties working together. You see, that money seems to be a lot but it is finally just keeping the lights on while we do the things people expect from us: offer the best possible and fastest VPN service in the world.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of timeline can we expect on these stretch goals regarding adding new servers?</strong></p>
<p>For the things we can fulfill immediately, like adding new countries to our server list, we try to do that during the campaign. But everything should be achieved by the end of January 2013. For the stretch goals  above 100.000 $, we'll try to sprinkle them through the next year so that there's always something to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>What happens after a year? Are you going to <ins cite=""mailto:Andrada%20Aglitoiu"" datetime=""2012-11-21T19:33""></ins>make another Crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p>
<p>This is valid for a period of 1 year. From January 2013 to December 2013. We will run the crowdfunding campaign again, next year around this time.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if you raise more money than you asked?</strong></p>
<p>Even better because then we can directly work for you and improve CyberGhost VPN. Look at our stretch goals above 100.000 $:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we reach $150.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 1 month (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)</li>
<li>If we reach $200.000 we add 1.000 IPs more, so we have 3.000 IPs</li>
<li>If we reach $250.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 3 month (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)</li>
<li>If we reach $300.000 we add 1.000 IPs more, so we have 4.000 IPs</li>
<li>If we reach $350.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 6 month (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)</li>
<li>If we reach $400.000 we add 1.000 IPs more, so we have 5.000 IPs</li>
<li>If we reach $450.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 1 year (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)</li>
<li>If we reach $500.000 we will spread the word and organize a free open conference about privacy, security and freedom in Bucharest</li>
</ul><p><strong>Aren’t you all a bit crazy with your “save the whole internet” thingie?</strong></p>
<p>There is a good argument for that.</p>
<p><strong>Is your CEO Robert really wearing a St. Pauli T-Shirt every day?</strong></p>
<p>Um, yes. Kind of.  And we are all happy that he has dozens of it, so he is really wearing  a new one every day. And with your help, we are going to see if he is also wearing St. Pauli underwear because in a weak moment he promised to show us, so we can post it on Facebook, if we make more then $100.000!</p>
<p><strong>What sizes do you offer on your t-shirt related rewards?</strong></p>
<p>For men, S (small) to XL (extra large). For women, XS (extra small) to XL (extra large).</p>
<p><strong>Do the upper perks include all previous rewards?</strong></p>
<p>Unless the description of the reward says ""you get all from $... perk,"" or it is a standalone reward.</p>
<p><strong>The perks over $25 have a CyberGhost subscription included. Which one exactly?</strong></p>
<p>These perks contain the best subscription available. At the moment, that is CyberGhost Premium Plus VPN with a worth of 159,99 USD. The duration is 1 year after activation. If we have a better subscription in our range by the end of January 2013, when we'll ship our perks, we will for sure, deliver that subscription.</p>
<p>The $1000 and $2500 perks contain a lifetime subscription. Please read therefor the FAQ ""Can I really get a lifetime subscription for CyberGhost? What does that mean?"" mentioned below.</p>
<p><strong>What’s with that CEO call that is available from the $250 perk up?</strong></p>
<p>You should give us your Skype account or landline number and Robert, our CEO will call you to make sure that we show our gratitude to what you did for us and the whole internet.</p>
<p><strong>I want to claim the perk that allows me to adopt a Ghostie. How does that work?</strong></p>
<p>Check out our cuties on <a href=""http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/ghosties-gallery.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ghosties Gallery"">Ghosties Gallery</a>.</p>
<p>These are all the Ghosties that were ever born in our laboratories. And they all search for a bit of love and affection. So you can adopt one of them and we will write your name under your Ghostie.</p>
<p>First come, first served. So we will ask you which Ghostie you like the most in the chronological order of your donation. If you donate later, it might be that the Ghostie of your dreams is gone – but don’t worry. There are dozens of tiny little Ghosties that need your love…</p>
<p><strong>I want to claim the perk that allows me to name a server. What names can I go for?</strong></p>
<p>You can choose for the name of your company, your wife, your pet or your favorite heavy metal band. But we will keep the right to refuse names when they are connected to things we hate at CyberGhost VPN like racist, homophobic, xenophobic or any other chauvinistic remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Can I really get a lifetime subscription for CyberGhost? What does that mean?</strong></p>
<p>We will provide you with a magic serial code. This code will run for 99 years and will always contain the highest subscription level we offer. Like magic…</p>
<p><strong>I want to have that place in your hall of fame. What does that mean?</strong></p>
<p>You send us a picture of you and we will put that picture on a DIN A1 Poster together with all other “Lionheart of the Internet” and “Captain of the Flying Ghostman” and these will be hung-up in the office of our CEO, Robert. So he will always be reminded who helped him out.</p>
<p><strong>I want to visit your HQ. How does that work?</strong></p>
<p>Claim the $2.500 perk, buy a flight ticket and come over to Bucharest for a week or a couple of days. We accommodate you in the same Hotel we use for all our business guests and give you a desk in our HQ, so you can be a Ghostie for a while. We take care about you and show you the advantages of the Romanian capital Bucharest.</p>
<p><strong>What do I get when I claim a dedicated server?</strong></p>
<p>You get your very own private VPN server, together with all other servers in our server park. But this server is your precious; your very special place to be and you can share it with up to 49 or 99 friends. That means that you receive either 50 or 100 subscription serials from us.</p>

On  one side, we pay a lot of money for the traffic you guys generate. We don’t know what you’re doing there, but we pay for hundreds of Terabytes every month. Then we pay for the rent of our server park and our IP-address pool. And we also need to pay rent, wages, health insurance, utilities and all the normal stuff that you pay for when you have twenty Ghosties working together. You see, that money seems to be a lot but it is finally just keeping the lights on while we do the things people expect from us: offer the best possible and fastest VPN service in the world.
What kind of timeline can we expect on these stretch goals regarding adding new servers?
For the things we can fulfill immediately, like adding new countries to our server list, we try to do that during the campaign. But everything should be achieved by the end of January 2013. For the stretch goals  above 100.000 $, we'll try to sprinkle them through the next year so that there's always something to look forward to.
What happens after a year? Are you going to make another Crowdfunding campaign?
This is valid for a period of 1 year. From January 2013 to December 2013. We will run the crowdfunding campaign again, next year around this time.
What happens if you raise more money than you asked?
Even better because then we can directly work for you and improve CyberGhost VPN. Look at our stretch goals above 100.000 $:

If we reach $150.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 1 month (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)
If we reach $200.000 we add 1.000 IPs more, so we have 3.000 IPs
If we reach $250.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 3 month (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)
If we reach $300.000 we add 1.000 IPs more, so we have 4.000 IPs
If we reach $350.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 6 month (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)
If we reach $400.000 we add 1.000 IPs more, so we have 5.000 IPs
If we reach $450.000 we offer our Free VPN without bandwidth-limitations for 1 year (right now we have a bandwidth-limitation of 2 Mbit/s)
If we reach $500.000 we will spread the word and organize a free open conference about privacy, security and freedom in Bucharest
Aren’t you all a bit crazy with your “save the whole internet” thingie?
There is a good argument for that.
Is your CEO Robert really wearing a St. Pauli T-Shirt every day?
Um, yes. Kind of.  And we are all happy that he has dozens of it, so he is really wearing  a new one every day. And with your help, we are going to see if he is also wearing St. Pauli underwear because in a weak moment he promised to show us, so we can post it on Facebook, if we make more then $100.000!
What sizes do you offer on your t-shirt related rewards?
For men, S (small) to XL (extra large). For women, XS (extra small) to XL (extra large).
Do the upper perks include all previous rewards?
Unless the description of the reward says ""you get all from $... perk,"" or it is a standalone reward.
The perks over $25 have a CyberGhost subscription included. Which one exactly?
These perks contain the best subscription available. At the moment, that is CyberGhost Premium Plus VPN with a worth of 159,99 USD. The duration is 1 year after activation. If we have a better subscription in our range by the end of January 2013, when we'll ship our perks, we will for sure, deliver that subscription.
The $1000 and $2500 perks contain a lifetime subscription. Please read therefor the FAQ ""Can I really get a lifetime subscription for CyberGhost? What does that mean?"" mentioned below.
What’s with that CEO call that is available from the $250 perk up?
You should give us your Skype account or landline number and Robert, our CEO will call you to make sure that we show our gratitude to what you did for us and the whole internet.
I want to claim the perk that allows me to adopt a Ghostie. How does that work?
Check out our cuties on Ghosties Gallery.
These are all the Ghosties that were ever born in our laboratories. And they all search for a bit of love and affection. So you can adopt one of them and we will write your name under your Ghostie.
First come, first served. So we will ask you which Ghostie you like the most in the chronological order of your donation. If you donate later, it might be that the Ghostie of your dreams is gone – but don’t worry. There are dozens of tiny little Ghosties that need your love…
I want to claim the perk that allows me to name a server. What names can I go for?
You can choose for the name of your company, your wife, your pet or your favorite heavy metal band. But we will keep the right to refuse names when they are connected to things we hate at CyberGhost VPN like racist, homophobic, xenophobic or any other chauvinistic remarks.
Can I really get a lifetime subscription for CyberGhost? What does that mean?
We will provide you with a magic serial code. This code will run for 99 years and will always contain the highest subscription level we offer. Like magic…
I want to have that place in your hall of fame. What does that mean?
You send us a picture of you and we will put that picture on a DIN A1 Poster together with all other “Lionheart of the Internet” and “Captain of the Flying Ghostman” and these will be hung-up in the office of our CEO, Robert. So he will always be reminded who helped him out.
I want to visit your HQ. How does that work?
Claim the $2.500 perk, buy a flight ticket and come over to Bucharest for a week or a couple of days. We accommodate you in the same Hotel we use for all our business guests and give you a desk in our HQ, so you can be a Ghostie for a while. We take care about you and show you the advantages of the Romanian capital Bucharest.
What do I get when I claim a dedicated server?
You get your very own private VPN server, together with all other servers in our server park. But this server is your precious; your very special place to be and you can share it with up to 49 or 99 friends. That means that you receive either 50 or 100 subscription serials from us.",6.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<b>The Details:</b>  So what is Wonderbolt?  Wonderbolt is hardware store help right in your pocket.  It allows you to measure either US or metric bolts or screws, including the length, diameter, and the thread count, from anywhere.  Whether in your garage wrenching on that classic car or out in the field doing inspection work, you can say goodbye to carrying around awkwardly-shaped gauges.  The information Wonderbolt provides is enough to make hardware store purchases like a pro, or since we're in the 21st century, make a confident, affordable online purchase.  The days of multi-trip, hardware store trial and error are over.  <br/><br/><p><b>Wonderbolt is not simply a measuring tool, however.</b>  It also provides related information from five different 
reference charts for any selected fastener.  Use Wonderbolt to determine
 the required socket or Allen wrench sizes, key dimensions in decimal 
form, or which drill bit to use for a clearance hole.  There is a 
“search size” function for a handy project reference, and it has even been designed for use in either hand (yeah lefties!).  <br/></p>

<p><b>Your Backing: </b>I'm asking for $7500, which is inexpensive in the world of app development.  That's because I have spent quite a bit of time trying to understand the development process and take steps that keep costs way down.  These include formulating a criteria for hiring quality developers, designing my own marketing materials, and personally doing a whole lot of leg work.  But there remains a lot I can not do on my own, so here is a breakdown of where your generous contributions will be allocated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$4000</b> in development costs.  Not only are apps written for Android in another programming language, but there are many more devices and resolutions to contend with.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$1000</b> in re-design costs.  Since Androids phones have different button schemes and functions, new layouts for user interaction will have to be developed.</li>
<li>
<b>$600</b> in maintenance and updates for the first few months after launch, simply to deal with the inevitable bug fixes bound to occur.  These updates will also incorporate valuable initial Android user feedback.</li>
<li>
<b>$600</b> in marketing fees.  This will most likely be in the form of press releases and the production of another video highlighting the app's functionality.  In addition, I will be initializing social media campaigns, generating my own marketing material in photoshop (much like the photos you see in this campaign), and contacting as many DIY celebrities as possible for endorsement.    <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How about the remaining contributions?  I've structured my rewards so that hopefully my donation amount is roughly 10-12x my anticipated rewards cost.  I'm making most of the rewards myself, meaning I can repay your kind donations with really cool stuff while simultaneously putting more money towards the end goal!</p>
<p>** Rest assured that whatever contribution amount I receive will go straight towards funding this app.  I truly believe that Wonderbolt can and will help a lot of people.<br/></p>

<p>Of course all backers will be entitled to a free copy of Wonderbolt on either iPhone or Android (when available).</p>

</div></div></div></div>","Ever mess up a bolt or screw size, bringing a project to a halt?  Give me a few minutes and I promise that will never happen again.  Hey Indiegogo’ers!  My name is Josh Koerpel and here's an embarrassing photo to kick off my pitch... Yup.  Me at 14 in the Tetons. My voice cracks were the only thing higher than the altitude.  It may be funny to look back, but those types of experiences teach us the most.  Then, I was just a kid improvising a shelter, but improvising taught me a lot about the satisfaction of building stuff with my hands.  Not to mention the importance of having the right tools to use the first time around.  Fast forward 20 years, and I've created an app that helps millions of iPhone users do (and have) just that. I've called it Wonderbolt. 

The Bottom Line: Wonderbolt is currently available only for iPhone.  With your contributions, we can build a version that also introduces Android users to the world of pixel-perfect bolt and screw measurement.  

All grown up, I am a mechanical engineer and an app developer.  Wonderbolt is something I've been working on for the past year, all on my own dime, because it works.  It is seriously useful.  It is the ultimate tool to help measure, identify, and work with bolts and screws for any type of project.  Think about that.  Other than mechanics who work with fasteners day in and day out, who else is familiar with the differences between an M6 and a 1/4 - 20 screw?  Nobody.  But that's the point!  That yard sale vintage desk you just bought, the one with the old rusty bolts?   What size do you need to replace them?  Or was the screw that just rattled loose from your motorcycle frame a US or a metric size?  Wonderbolt has these answers, and more.  This simple and effective tool can save time, money, and frustrations for the novice and professional alike.  And speaking from personal experience, this is a tool everyone on this list should keep in their toolkit.   

Wonderbolt has been available for free in the App Store for the past few months and has received fantastic reviews from a variety of sources.  Here's a quick sample:

""The app helped us get the right bolt without having to spend 30 mins wandering through the fastener aisle.""""...Used app, got size on spot, and called for quick delivery to job site.  Great, practical idea!""""Has saved me many trips back to the store...""People who have used Wonderbolt, love it.  But there has been one comment I've heard more than any other:






We want Wonderbolt for Android!

And I would imagine this is why...

The Details:  So what is Wonderbolt?  Wonderbolt is hardware store help right in your pocket.  It allows you to measure either US or metric bolts or screws, including the length, diameter, and the thread count, from anywhere.  Whether in your garage wrenching on that classic car or out in the field doing inspection work, you can say goodbye to carrying around awkwardly-shaped gauges.  The information Wonderbolt provides is enough to make hardware store purchases like a pro, or since we're in the 21st century, make a confident, affordable online purchase.  The days of multi-trip, hardware store trial and error are over.  Wonderbolt is not simply a measuring tool, however.  It also provides related information from five different 
reference charts for any selected fastener.  Use Wonderbolt to determine
 the required socket or Allen wrench sizes, key dimensions in decimal 
form, or which drill bit to use for a clearance hole.  There is a 
“search size” function for a handy project reference, and it has even been designed for use in either hand (yeah lefties!).  




Your Backing: I'm asking for $7500, which is inexpensive in the world of app development.  That's because I have spent quite a bit of time trying to understand the development process and take steps that keep costs way down.  These include formulating a criteria for hiring quality developers, designing my own marketing materials, and personally doing a whole lot of leg work.  But there remains a lot I can not do on my own, so here is a breakdown of where your generous contributions will be allocated:


$4000 in development costs.  Not only are apps written for Android in another programming language, but there are many more devices and resolutions to contend with.  


$1000 in re-design costs.  Since Androids phones have different button schemes and functions, new layouts for user interaction will have to be developed.

$600 in maintenance and updates for the first few months after launch, simply to deal with the inevitable bug fixes bound to occur.  These updates will also incorporate valuable initial Android user feedback.

$600 in marketing fees.  This will most likely be in the form of press releases and the production of another video highlighting the app's functionality.  In addition, I will be initializing social media campaigns, generating my own marketing material in photoshop (much like the photos you see in this campaign), and contacting as many DIY celebrities as possible for endorsement.    


How about the remaining contributions?  I've structured my rewards so that hopefully my donation amount is roughly 10-12x my anticipated rewards cost.  I'm making most of the rewards myself, meaning I can repay your kind donations with really cool stuff while simultaneously putting more money towards the end goal!
** Rest assured that whatever contribution amount I receive will go straight towards funding this app.  I truly believe that Wonderbolt can and will help a lot of people.


What you get in return! (other than a wink from the Gods):  Okay lets talk rewards!
Of course all backers will be entitled to a free copy of Wonderbolt on either iPhone or Android (when available).
There will be shop rags and decals that have a design logo similar to the one below.  Perfect for slapping on the side of the toolbox or wiping that nervous forehead sweat after your rebuilt engine kicks over on the first try.  


There are also custom-made shop bottle openers, Video thank-yous, and one-of-a-kind shop phone caddies just waiting to be claimed.  I know it's not a set of Snap On socket wrenches, but these unique rewards will grab some serious attention.  If you can't afford to back the campaign right now, don't worry.  I've been there for sure.  That doesn't mean you still can't help the cause though.  Here are some ways you can help me get Wonderbolt's name out there and into the hands of those who need it:  

Social Media.  People take advice from friends.  Take a second a share this campaign with your friends on Facebook, your followers on Twitter, or anyone else you feel could benefit from knowing about this project.  


Word of Mouth.  Know someone with an iPhone who could use Wonderbolt?  Let 'em know!  I promise they will thank you for it.

<div><b>Is it water proof?</b></div>
<div>- It is <b>NOT</b> waterproof in the sense that you <b>can't go swimming</b> or take a shower with it. However, it is <b>water resistant</b>, so you will have no worries about the sweatiest of hands or running in a light rain. If in doubt, or when running in a heavy rainstorm, we recommend putting your phone in a plastic baggy to be safe.</div>
<div><b>Can I wash it?</b></div>
<div>- Yes, we recommend hand washing and air drying. The heat of the dryer may melt the plastic screen.</div>
<div><b>Will my phone fit?</b></div>
<div>- Once the project closes, we will be sending a survey asking you what size pouch you will need. It will list the max device dimensions for both pouch sizes, and it is pretty easy to determine what will work best for you. If you are unsure, please just reply back to the survey with your phone/protective case combination and we will be happy to send you the correctly sized pouch.</div>
<div><b>What about my earbud cord?</b></div>
<div>- Glad you asked! We have designed it so that your earbud cord will easily fit through the pouch no matter where your cord jack is. Since you will probably have a bit of extra cord, we recomend you feed the cord through your shirtsleeve.</div>

That's enough to fast-charge a 2019 13"" MacBook Pro.No, really — SHARGE is so small that it will even fit into the coin pocket of your jeans! One Charger for AllWe designed SHARGE to completely replace every laptop/device charger you’ve ever owned.SHARGE is universally compatible with virtually every laptop, tablet, smartphone, and smart device on the market today — and can charge up to three devices simultaneously!Designed for Travel ProsSHARGE’s compact size makes it perfect for travelers and digital nomads.SHARGE accepts worldwide universal 100-240V voltage, meaning you’ll never need a voltage converter when you travel abroad.And since SHARGE has no internal battery, it is completely safe for air travel and for use on airplanes.Further, SHARGE also features fold-in electrical pins for optimal compactness and convenience. Half the Size, Twice the SpeedDon't let SHARGE's size fool you. It’s small, but mighty. SHARGE It is compatible with a wide range of fast-charging protocols, including QC4+, PD3.0, QC3.0, PPS, SCP, FCP, AFC, and PE+. This means you can fully charge a 2019 13"" MacBook Pro in just 1.7 hours!And you can charge your iPhone X in 1.6 hours — that’s 2.5x faster than with the 5W charger that came with it. Smart Power Splitting (SPS)SHARGE uses a patent-pending technology called Smart Power Splitting (SPS), which intelligently determines how much power to feed to each device attached.SHARGE is capable of providing a total of 65W to all devices plugged into it. If only one laptop/device is plugged in, that device can use the entire 65 Watts if it is able to.If more than one device is plugged in, the 65W will be intelligently split among the devices, to ensure all of them charge as quickly as possible.For example, if you plug in a 13"" MacBook Pro, an 11"" iPad Pro, and an iPhone X at the same time, the wattage will be split as follows: Note: Please ensure that your laptop needs no more than a 65W charger. If your device typically feeds off more than 65W SHARGE will likely still charge it, but it will charge it more slowly than a higher-wattage charger would.  Goodbye Silicon, Hello GaN!GaN. You've probably seen this word floating around the internet recently. But what is it exactly?GaN stands for Gallium Nitride, and it is the heart of what makes SHARGE so groundbreaking. With this technology, SHARGE delivers a revolutionary level of performance and efficiency compared to traditional power adapters. Most microchips, like the one inside your computer, are made of silicon. Silicon is relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture.However, SHARGE’s chips are made of GaN, which produces less heat during operation — 40% less actually — meaning it can run more efficiently and can be significantly smaller than other silicon-based chargers.To put it in a nutshell, GaN allows SHARGE to be smaller, lighter, and more efficient than any other 65W charger out there. Safety FirstWe have obsessed over every detail of SHARGE to ensure it is as safe as possible.We carefully engineered an internal chipset that protects your devices in the event of a power surge or short circuit, and also provides over-temperature protection.SHARGE also has a state-of-the-art fireproof casing, and has passed all required certifications (FCC, ETL, DoE, CEC etc.).   Complimentary Premium Braided Non-Tangle USB-C Cable IncludedNot every USB-C cable is created equally.Almost any USB-C cable can charge a smartphone, as most phones only need around 5W to juice up.However, not every USB-C cable can charge a laptop. A special type of USB-C cable is needed in order to transmit the full 65W needed to charge some notebook computers.This might seem confusing, but fear not — SHARGE has your back. We will throw in a professional-grade, thickly braided, 1.5 meter USB-C to USB-C cable for any and all of your USB-C charging needs. With it’s integrated eMark chip, it can charge anything from your wireless headphones to your MacBook Pro. What if I live outside the US?SHARGE's interchangeable plug heads AU/EU/UK easily slide-in ‘over’ the folded US plug and securely clicks into place.Non-US backers receive one free interchangeable plug with each SHARGE, based on the shipping destination (i.e. Germany = EU plug, New Zealand = AU plug etc.). All backers will have the option to add-on interchangeable plugs as part of the final shipping confirmation survey. But what if my laptop does NOT charge with USB-C?No worries! You're good. Any laptop, so long as it requires no more than 65W, can be charged with SHARGE. All you need is a small USB-C adapter. We offer USB-C to laptop adapters for 18 laptop tips, including Apple Magsafe 1/2 and Microsoft Surface.All laptop to USB-C adapters (18 variations) will be made available to backers as part of the final shipping confirmation survey. Proof of Concept Video

<p><b>Hello!

Now we need your help in disrupting the way people enter text on their small mobile devices. </p>
<p>Yes! We really intend to change the world, and we hope you help us do it!</p><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></div><div>

<p>MessagEase, our keyboard, is designed based on many years of scientific research and development. It is based on sound UX design principles and it is optimized for one or two fingers. It really works: see our users ratings and responses below.</p>
<p>The QWERTY keyboard—designed almost 200 years ago—fails when used on a small touchscreen area. Its tiny keys make you error-prone, and dictionary-based autocorrections often miscorrect and embarrass you.</p>
<p>We designed MessagEase with this issue in mind. It has fewer, larger keys making them much easier to target on small touchscreens.</p>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1047171/files/20141125160921-igg_1.png?1416960561"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>MessagEase's optimal letter assignment uses letter and di-gram frequency data and exhaustive simulation to minimize finger movement and maximize speed.</p></span></span></div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1054884/files/20141128230038-frequencyAndDigram.png?1417244438"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></span></div>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>To accommodate the rest of the characters using only nine large keys, MessagEase places less frequent characters on the sides of the keys; you enter them with a directional drag or slide. Here is MessagEase's complete keyboard design with all the letters, special characters, and additional text-management keys (space, backspace, return, cut, copy, paste, select all, change of language, etc.)</p>

<p>This optimized arrangement, as strange as it may seem at first, is very efficient in entering all letters, special characters, editing commands, and many other text related functions not found on regular QWERTY keyboards. The research work behind this innovative design is <a href=""http://www.exideas.com/ME/ICMI2003Paper.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">published</a> and we have an issued patent (US 6,847,706) to protect it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>MessagEase also includes Ctrl/Alt/Fn keys and an easy way to enter all accented and characters. Furthermore, all drag positions are user-programmable; you can define your own keyboard design, as many of our users have. Please see our user-defined keyboards <a href=""http://www.exideas.com/ME/keyboardsOnline.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>.</p>

<h3>What's Next</h3>
<div></div>
<p>Your contributions will greatly help us in launching and completing several crucial components of our keyboard. First and foremost, we are working on a true keyboard replacement for Apple's iOS8. We also need to upgrade our Android version to improve its compliance with Android 5.0. We also have several Smartwatch projects in our pipeline, one for Android wearable/watches, another for Samsung's Tizen, and yet another one for Apple watch (the specs of which not determined yet). Another important component of our keyboard is its word prediction capability; we need to improve it to be in par of existing QWERTY-based word predictions. Our Windows version needs to be brought up do date and in par with our Android version. We will do this in two phases, as indicated below. We also need to implement the floating capability for our Android version, to make it better suit the larger tablets. Here's the timeline for our work ahead:</p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Changing user behavior is a formidable challenge, but the QWERTY keyboard is so inadequate for small touchscreen devices that we believe a better method of text entry can succeed. Our belief is supported by our ability to grow a remarkable number of very loyal users.</p>
<p>In the face of change, often manufacturers and software providers of smartphones and smartwatches either cling to the status quo or are immobilized by NIH. Their fear of outside innovation is another challenge. However, we believe that by demonstrating the advantages of MessagEase and by further growing our loyal grass-root users, they will see MessagEase as a competitive advantage and a distinguishing factor for their operation and success.</p>
<p>Our many years of experience of honing and perfecting MessagEase added to our passion for providing the best tool for the future of text entry energize us to overcome these challenges. </p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>MessagEase is already on Apple Store, so why do you need to develop it for iOS?</b></p>
<p>Our current MessagEase app is not a true keyboard replacement for iOS. Only recently, with the introduction of iOS8, Apple enabled third-party software developers to create true keyboard tools. Our older MessagEase app no longer works under iOS8 and wee need to develop an iOS8 keyboard to replace it.</p>
<p><b>What’s your business model with your Android app being free?</b></p>
<p>Our over-arching goal is to get many people to try and experience MessagEase’s superior speed, accuracy and ease of use. We decided that having people pay for it would be counter to this goal and it would reduce MessagEase’s chances of success. Rather, we aim to grow the number of users and supporters of MessagEase to such a large number that the smartphone and smartwatch makers would find it not only indispensible but also competitively advantageous to embed it in their devices.</p>
<p><b>How long does it takes to learn MessagEase?</b></p>
<p>Our users tell us that it takes from a few minutes to a couple of hours of interspersed practice to become comfortable, even efficient, with MessagEase. They also tell us that playing our learning games help them climb the learning curve much faster than they expected.</p>

</div></div>","Hello! My name is Saied Nesbat.  I am the founder and CEO of Exideas, a Silicon Valley software company.  We have invented an innovative text input technology for touchscreen devices that is better, faster and easier than the QWERTY keyboard. Now we need your help in disrupting the way people enter text on their small mobile devices. 
Yes! We really intend to change the world, and we hope you help us do it!



MessagEase, our keyboard, is designed based on many years of scientific research and development. It is based on sound UX design principles and it is optimized for one or two fingers. It really works: see our users ratings and responses below.
The QWERTY keyboard—designed almost 200 years ago—fails when used on a small touchscreen area. Its tiny keys make you error-prone, and dictionary-based autocorrections often miscorrect and embarrass you.
We designed MessagEase with this issue in mind. It has fewer, larger keys making them much easier to target on small touchscreens.

MessagEase's optimal letter assignment uses letter and di-gram frequency data and exhaustive simulation to minimize finger movement and maximize speed.




To accommodate the rest of the characters using only nine large keys, MessagEase places less frequent characters on the sides of the keys; you enter them with a directional drag or slide. Here is MessagEase's complete keyboard design with all the letters, special characters, and additional text-management keys (space, backspace, return, cut, copy, paste, select all, change of language, etc.)





This optimized arrangement, as strange as it may seem at first, is very efficient in entering all letters, special characters, editing commands, and many other text related functions not found on regular QWERTY keyboards. The research work behind this innovative design is published and we have an issued patent (US 6,847,706) to protect it.


MessagEase also includes Ctrl/Alt/Fn keys and an easy way to enter all accented and characters. Furthermore, all drag positions are user-programmable; you can define your own keyboard design, as many of our users have. Please see our user-defined keyboards here.
Here's a short video demonstrating how MessagEase keyboard works:



As the video demonstrates, we have implemented MessagEase and made it available for Android and Windows devices. With more than 100,000 installed users, MessagEase enjoys a growing and enthusiastic number of users. Here's how our users have rated MessagEase on Android's Google Play so far:





An overwhelming number of our users have rated MessagEase with 4, or 5 stars. Most people tell us they would never go back to QWERTY on their touchscreen devices, after using MessagEase for a few days. You can see all our users reviews and ratings here. Here's a sample from Google Play:






Since MessagEase is an innovative keyboard, it may look strange at first and it takes some getting used to. Our users' feedback indicates that it would take from a few minutes to one or two hours to become comfortable, even very proficient with MessagEase. 
Further practice also pays off, as we have users with speeds of above 80 words per minute. Please see our leaderboard. 
To enhance the learning process, we have created several fun typing games that teaches you MessagEase in stages. Balloon Game, Words Game, and Speed Game among the games provided in our MessagEase Game Package for our Android users. 


MessagEase game for Android is available for free on Google Play.



Our Vision and Goals
Our vision is to change the world by providing an easier, faster, and more accurate full-text interface for touch screen devices. 
Our goals:


Provide the the easiest touch-screen input for smartphones and tablets.
Create the easiest and the most practical means to enter full text on smartwatches.
Empower children who will learn how to write on touch screen devices with an input method optimized for speed and accuracy.
Create the best one-handed/one-finger input technology for devices that need to be operated with one finger, e.g., smartwatches, smartphones, (Internet) TV remote controllers.
Facilitate the use of touch screen devices and computers for people who've never used a computer or a keyboard before.




   We Need You Support 
If you share our
vision—and we hope you do—of bettering the world by making it easier for people
to use touchscreen devices, we want you to participate and share our joy in doing so.
So far we have invented,
implemented, proved the concept, productized and won the loyalty of a remarkable number of users. To attain
our vision, however, we need your generous support so that we bring MessagEase
to iPhones, iPad, and smartwatches. We also need to continually update our
technology to better match the capabilities of the new devices.
Changing the world is a
lofty goal, but with your help and our diligence, we are confident that we can
do just that.
  What You Receive In Return 

By investing in MessagEase you will enable us replace the QWERTY keyboard where it fails. In return, we will include your name in all future versions of MessagEase, on the list of our benefactors. Your name will be seen by everyone using the keyboard at some point as a testament your vision and support for innovation.







As a token of our appreciation and depending on the level of your support we will send you a sweatshirt or a Tshirt with MessagEase’s logo on the front and the phrase “I Support Innovation” on the back to commemorate your generous support.

<h2>What is Geek Stream?</h2>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/tu9RcjN-we8?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p>Geek Stream takes the cutting edge technology that we've developed for the Geek Out and puts into an ultra portable battery powered, multi-platform unit.  Geek Stream allows your headphones to reach their full potential with crisper audio, lower bass notes and a wider sound stage to emulate how your music was designed to be heard.</p>
<h2>Geek Stream is a Problem Solver</h2>
<p><strong>Problem</strong> - If you're a high resolution music lover, a majority of  audio devices can't play any higher resolution than standard CD (16/44.1).  That sucks!
	</p><ul>
<li>It's a digital to analog converter (DAC).  Our ears can't hear anything that's digital; digital signals have to be converted into analog form before we can hear them.  DACs are everywhere: in your phone, in your TV, in your laptop or any other audio playing device.  The problem with those DACs is this: they suck.  Geek Stream's DAC doesn't suck.</li>
<li>It's high definition. Geek Stream can play any current or anticipated audio format and decodes digital files with resolutions as high as 32 bit/384 kHz PCM and 1 bit/5.644 MHz (DSD 128).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Problem</strong> - Standard headphone output isn't powerful enough!  If you're in a crowded place, like a coffee shop, it's often hard to hear-- even with your music cranked to 11.
	</p><ul>
<li>It's a headphone amp.  Ever wish you could turn up the volume on your music just a little more?  Well, Geek Stream's amplifier is up to 10 times more powerful than the headphone amplifier typically used in audio devices.  That means you can really crank this sucker up.  Not only is it louder, it's clearer and has dramatically more bass.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem</strong> - Car audio and home theater sound systems just don't live up to your Hi-Fi expectations.
	</p><ul>
<li>Line out feature.  Geek Stream has a line out feature allowing you to simply plug into whatever audio source you desire and instantly hear the difference with higher quality sound and clarity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Multiple Configurations</h2>
<p>
	Even a one-device audio ninja has multiple katana's.  We've designed three configurations of Geek Stream to meet even the most demanding expectations of music aficionados.
	</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Geek Stream 160</strong>:<br/><p style=""margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;"">32 bit/382kHz PCM <strong>+</strong> DSD128 DAC<br/>3100 mAh lithium ion battery<br/>160mW headphone amplifier</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Device Compatibility</h2>
<p>Geek Stream is the master of adaptability. Keeping true to its name sake, we've designed Geek Stream to be compatible with iOS (with Apple Camera Kit), Android &amp; USB 2.0 audio class compatible devices.</p>
<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>LH Labs is an amalgamation of audio geeks and engineers who have partnered together with one sole purpose in mind: bringing the sound of high-end audio to the masses.</p>
<p>Based in Northern California, the epicenter of the high-end audio industry, LH Labs was founded on the principal that music lovers deserve something better than just the ""usual."" We've made it our mission to create the best products possible for both audiophiles and music enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We've earned all kinds of awards, including a CES Innovations Honoree Award, A Publisher's Choice Award from TONEAudio, a Greatest Bits Award from Audio Stream, a Writer's Choice Award from Positive Feedback Online, and a Blue Moon Award from sixmoons.com.

It's a headphone amp.  Ever wish you could turn up the volume on your music just a little more?  Well, Geek Stream's amplifier is up to 10 times more powerful than the headphone amplifier typically used in audio devices.  That means you can really crank this sucker up.  Not only is it louder, it's clearer and has dramatically more bass.

Problem - Car audio and home theater sound systems just don't live up to your Hi-Fi expectations.
	
Line out feature.  Geek Stream has a line out feature allowing you to simply plug into whatever audio source you desire and instantly hear the difference with higher quality sound and clarity.

Multiple Configurations

	Even a one-device audio ninja has multiple katana's.  We've designed three configurations of Geek Stream to meet even the most demanding expectations of music aficionados.

Geek Stream 320:32 bit/382kHz PCM + DSD128 DAC3100 mAh lithium ion battery320mW headphone amplifier


Geek Stream 320 Signature Edition:32 bit/382kHz PCM + DSD128 DAC3100 mAh lithium ion battery320mW headphone amplifier—3 dB THD Performance Enhancement


Device Compatibility
Geek Stream is the master of adaptability. Keeping true to its name sake, we've designed Geek Stream to be compatible with iOS (with Apple Camera Kit), Android & USB 2.0 audio class compatible devices.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>While the application works, it is not scalable. It currently interfaces to the SMS world using a single modem with an application written specifically for that modem making it inflexible and non-scalable.</p>

<ul>
<li>Needs to migrate from using a cellular modem to an SMS gateway service</li>
<li>Must support creating aliases for numbers</li>
<li>Needs a back-end database to maintain aliases and other data</li>
<li>Currently, the gateway will only work with numbers in the U.S. and Canada, but ideally it would support international numbers as well.<br/>
</li>
</ul>In order to continue development, I need a subscription to an SMS provider, such as Clickatell. Using an SMS gateway service will provide the following benefits:<br/><ul>
<li>The application will no longer be hardware dependent, making it easier to install and use in multiple locations</li>
<li>It will make the application easier to port to other platforms (Linux, embedded hardware, etc).</li>
<li>It will allow the application to be deployed by Amateur Radio Clubs anywhere, not just in my network.</li>
<li>Allow delivery verification in both directions<br/>

<p>The funding collected will be used to purchase a subscription with an SMS Gateway service allowing me to complete development of the server-side interface and begin the process of porting the application to other platforms as well as making it generally available to the wider amateur radio community.</p>

</h3>APRS* users can send messages to SMSGTE with the 10-digit phone number as the first word in the message. The message will be routed via the gateway to the number provided.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The application allows us to remove messaging barriers between APRS* and the SMS world. The most compelling use of this gateway is for emergency communications.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR STORY</h2>
<p>In the Spring of 2018, two friends came together to develop a life-changing, nay, a world-changing product. Collin Clevenger and Jacob Nolley have been best friends since fourth grade. From selling pencil erasers in elementary school to headbands in high school, we have always had a deep passion for entrepreneurship, but with a lack of resources or expertise, we always had a difficult time getting a product sold beyond the borders of our hometown. That is where the inspiration for <strong>The Graphite Lab</strong> began.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526852260/xkokhqzcgjb3lp7gqusz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Graphite Lab is a product development company focused on reducing the barrier to entry for young entrepreneurs with great ideas. We want to give people like ourselves the opportunity to take their products to market regardless of their financial or knowledge base. Once we develop a relationship with the entrepreneur, we will do all of the product development, marketing, financing, etc. in house and sell it through our sales' channels while educating the entrepreneur throughout the whole process. We make money once the product sells.</p>

<p>The GripIt is the most comfortable, carefree, and customizable way to hold your phone. Our patent-pending design allows users a comfortable elastic grip with the freedom to change its design in seconds. By adhering our breakthrough plastic to your phone, you will not only get a piece of mind knowing that your valuable device will not be dropped, you will also get a versatile kickstand that will allow you to rest your phone both vertically and horizontally. We know that most phone accessories add unwanted width to your sleek and slim device. That is why we designed the GripIt to be half the thickness of our biggest competitor. Your phone shouldn't catch on your pocket every time you put it away just because you want an easier way to hold it. Now it doesn't have to. If you help us reach our funding goal, we will not only get to bring GripIts to life, we will also get to start helping other young entrepreneurs make their dreams into realities.</p>

OUR STORY
In the Spring of 2018, two friends came together to develop a life-changing, nay, a world-changing product. Collin Clevenger and Jacob Nolley have been best friends since fourth grade. From selling pencil erasers in elementary school to headbands in high school, we have always had a deep passion for entrepreneurship, but with a lack of resources or expertise, we always had a difficult time getting a product sold beyond the borders of our hometown. That is where the inspiration for The Graphite Lab began.


The Graphite Lab is a product development company focused on reducing the barrier to entry for young entrepreneurs with great ideas. We want to give people like ourselves the opportunity to take their products to market regardless of their financial or knowledge base. Once we develop a relationship with the entrepreneur, we will do all of the product development, marketing, financing, etc. in house and sell it through our sales' channels while educating the entrepreneur throughout the whole process. We make money once the product sells.

 
To test this model, we introduce to you our very first product:

The GripIt is the most comfortable, carefree, and customizable way to hold your phone. Our patent-pending design allows users a comfortable elastic grip with the freedom to change its design in seconds. By adhering our breakthrough plastic to your phone, you will not only get a piece of mind knowing that your valuable device will not be dropped, you will also get a versatile kickstand that will allow you to rest your phone both vertically and horizontally. We know that most phone accessories add unwanted width to your sleek and slim device. That is why we designed the GripIt to be half the thickness of our biggest competitor. Your phone shouldn't catch on your pocket every time you put it away just because you want an easier way to hold it. Now it doesn't have to. If you help us reach our funding goal, we will not only get to bring GripIts to life, we will also get to start helping other young entrepreneurs make their dreams into realities.

We want to know what you think about NanoSmart. Any time you have any an idea about a product or feature enhancement (like receiving weather, Facebook, or Twitter notifications), tell us and we'll see what we can do! In fact, if we like your idea, we may even send you a small token of thanks once it's implemented. </p>

The Origins of WiMe and NanoSmart: 

WiMe is a Taiwan-based company specializing in wireless product research, design, and manufacturing. At “WiMe,” short for Wireless Me, we strive to create trendy, portable products. Our goal is use mobile technology to help simplify the lives of our users.

While convenient for browsing the internet and watching a video, the founders at WiMe noticed that as smartphone devices grow in size, they're also becoming increasingly difficult to carry around. This inspired WiMe to design the one-stop mobile accessory solution - NanoSmart. Our versatile product can serve as a modern Bluetooth headset and dialer (answer or dial directly using the device), a music a player, as well as a smartwatch (syncs critical data like contacts and calendars instantly from your smart phone). Is that all!?! Of course not! There's one more key feature that really sets NanoSmart apart in the mobile devices and smartwatch market. Simply insert your local SIM card and instantly transform NanoSmart into a hassel-free, stand-alone phone.
 
How Can NanoSmart Help Simply Your Life? 


International travel or have more than one SIM. Insert a SIM card directly into the unlocked NanoSmart. With critical data (contacts) synced from your smart phone, NanoSmart functions as the perfect mini-clone of your primary mobile device during your travels or when you need another phone - NanoSmart is ready for use anywhere, anytime!


Heading out and don't feel like lugging around a giant smartphone. Leave the excess bulk behind when you want to go for a run or hit the gym! Use this powerful little gadget to tune-in to FM radio or use it as your MP3 player! With your synced contacts, music uploads, and local SIM, you'll be able to venture outdoors while enjoying music and staying connected to your mobile network. 


Keep better track of your insane schedule. Don’t miss another business meeting, school pickup, or meal with a friend. Sync NanoSmart to your Google Calendar (Android smart phones only for now) and wear the device as a smart watch to receive reminders about upcoming appointments.

The scent also lingers for days before you might need it again... And whatever remains in the sealed fragrance bottle doesn't evaporate so it lasts a long time. <br/></p>

</div></div>","We all encounter odor situations while driving that need immediate odor control ... stinky food, sweaty kids from a ball game, people farting, or just simply to freshen up the car before your date.  Now imagine having a device that can easily control any car odor, anytime, ""On Demand"" with a great aroma.  Introducing the All New AIRE CONTROL, the ONLY auto fragrance device that allows the driver total ON-DEMAND control of the aroma in your car. 


FEATURES and BENEFITS
AIRE CONTROL LOOKS COOL and is VERY EASY to USE. 
This revolutionary design that is safe and easy to use, Just mount it to any car vent, turn on the air, and squeeze the bottle 1-2 times to energize the internal wicking system (it doesn't spray out and make any mess).  Within seconds, the wonderful Aroma flows out filling the car with a great scent just the way you want it. The scent also lingers for days before you might need it again... And whatever remains in the sealed fragrance bottle doesn't evaporate so it lasts a long time. 
TESTIMONIALS




LONG LASTING PERFORMANCE

Unlike all those ""conventional air fresheners"" which are typically strong only in the beginning and weaken or dry up quickly and uncontrollably, AIRE CONTROL is super long lasting. over 60 days depending on usage.  

Each fragrance bottle holds 120 shots of concentrated fragrance oil, so if using average 2 shots a day, you have 60 days of usage.  It can last even longer If you don't use your car often (I travel away 1-2 wks at time sometimes) because the fragrance oil bottle is sealed tight so the fragrance oil stays in the bottle and does NOT self-evaporate like all other conventional air fresheners. Best of all,  AIRE CONTROL allows you to control when and how strong you like it... On Demand. 
FRAGRANCE SELECTIONS

 To launch AIRE CONTROL, we selected four of the most popular fragrances for North America. Our NEW CAR SCENT is refreshing, with hints of leather and cologne, VANILLA, rich and dreamy, FRESH LINEN, clean and crisp like laundry just out of the dryer, and CITRUS BREEZE, zesty, fresh and fruity. FRAGRANCE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCEQuality wise, AIRE CONTROL uses the best fragrance oil from around the world to make each unique fragrance offered. We source our fragrance from France, Japan, and America, and quality control production process to ensure they are the best for our senses and yours.
 AIRE CONTROL fragrance oil is sourced from the best fragrance suppliers in France, Japan and USA. Fully tested to ensure performance and reliability. 
EASILY REFILLABLE  (patent pending feature)
Finally, when you're finished with a fragrance bottle, AIRE CONTROL can easily be recharged without throwing the entire unit away which causes land fill waste. You just pull down the empty bottle, and push a new bottle back up! It's that simple.

FOUNDER'S STORY

Henry Wu is the founder and CEO of Aromate America Corporation, a start-up auto fragrance company located in Mission Viejo, California. Aromate America is the US subsidiary of Aromate Industries Co. Ltd., a world leading air freshener company with over 18 years experience in manufacturing and global sales of auto fragrance products.Henry was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 10. He lived in Los Angeles during his early teens and later moved to New York City where he attended Forest Hills High School in Queens. Henry attained a BS in Mechanical Engineering from State University of New York in Stony Brook. 
The ambitious Henry started his engineering career in Connecticut as a project engineer before fate sent him back to Taiwan to explore his future endeavors... While there, Henry has worked as a PM in a world renown Industrial PC company, and later becoming the Sales and Marketing Director of Aromate Industries of Taiwan. His engineering experience and marketing savvy greatly contributed to the growth of Aromate Industries over the years. Now moved back to the United States, Henry's aim is to focus on this market with Aromate America. Henry is diversified, in that he is adept at conducting cross-culture business, as well as creating engineering designs, managing manufacturing, sales and marketing on a global scale.


On this AIRE CONTROL launch campaign, Henry has proudly teamed with Chip and Kim McAllister, the Season 5 winners of the CBS Emmy Award Winning television show, THE AMAZING RACE (Google them!) The McAllister's are also the founders of PeopleStar FilmWorks.  This amazing couple and Henry met by fate and the McAllisters enlighten Henry to the world of Social media marketing. Together they collaborated to produce the online pre-order campaign on INDEIGOGO for AIRE CONTROL™ kicking off Monday, September 22nd, 2014.
 Why AIRE CONTROLHaving been in the auto fragrance industry for so long, we’ve seen many fads come and go. With all the fancy air fresheners variations out there (some we produced), we know they really don’t work well when you need them at those “special moments” while driving.  In the market today, there is nothing that lets the drivers control ""When"" and ""How Much"" aroma they like in their car anytime, ON DEMAND.  That’s why we developed the AIRE CONTROL Auto Fragrance System. With AIRE CONTROL, we had to think “out of the box”, away from the conventional concepts we see around us. Together with our engineering team, we searched for what has been done and gather what failed and worked, and finally perfected the AIRE CONTROL after over 2 years of developments and improvements. Several unique features has been patented or patent pending to protect our hard work. Features like easy refill, by simply pulling down the bottle and replacing a new one when finished, how simple! Also the Internal Wicking system that is leak proof yet can deliver strong aroma intensity when one desires. Finally, our fragrance lab matches AIRE CONTROL with various quality aromatic oils that are safe and bring joy to your senses…. We love this product and really believe there is nothing better. We hope you will make a pledge to try it and fall in love with it too.
WHY INDIEGOGO

In the world of retail air freshener market, it’s flooded with many products using the same old concepts just in different designs (paper, gel, wicks). It would be extremely difficult for a regular consumer to differentiate how AIRE CONTROL is better among them, it would just be “lost” in the crowd. ( Sure It would be great if our Indiegogo video can be played next to AIRE CONTROL in the shops, but with our America startup trying to swim thru the retail sharks, we really don’t think that’s going to happen anytime soon.)   So that is why we are going directly to YOU, the drivers that want something better for their car! We believe our AIRE CONTROL is very unique, and compelling. And Indiegogo provides the perfect environment for storytelling. We envision our campaign as an event to showcase this unique product to all that need it or wants to try it. In the meantime, we will gather everyone’s enthusiasm and feedback to fully bring this product to the market the right way. So please make a pledge today and help us spread the word on AIRE CONTROL, the On Demand Auto Fragrance You can Control.

However, due to the limited screen size, it is still not easy to show content to others. The best solution, whether for a business trip, a presentation or a movie, is to have a portable projector. Most of pocket projectors on the market couldn't reach a perfect balance between: big screen, long utility time, high image quality and small body. Apart from that, a traditional pico projector still needs a tripod to stand, so it’s not easy to carry around. To provide everyone with a real portable smart projector, that’s why we bring the Keruo L7 to birth. Now everything is different.

While finishing his PhD, at the Arena, Sergei was struck by the growing power and popularity of drone photography. Frustrated by overly complicated existing systems, he set out to build something more robust, and eventually arrived at using a taut tether to sidestep fundamental drone limitations.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So the Fotokite was born with one mission: making aerial photography accessible to everyone. Specifically, we aspire to solve fundamental drone issues: safety, need piloting skills, lack accountability, complex regulations and limited flight time. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After a debut at TED2014 (Sergei is now a TED Fellow), the company developed its first product: the Fotokite Pro, a live broadcast aerial camera that can fly for hours thanks to being powered from the ground. The Fotokite Pro was presented for the first time at NAB2015, and has been used for several productions and is being evaluated for more.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Working closely with the broadcasting industry on a professional solution gave Fotokite the experience to start working on a more affordable version: the Fotokite Phi. By being able to shed core drone components such as expensive GPS receivers and by getting rid of an RC controller, we have been able to build what is, to our knowledge, the lightest, friendliest, safest, most portable and most affordable GoPro quadcopter yet.</p>

<p><span><b>1. Customer Service</b></span></p>
<p><i>Q: What is your refund policy?</i></p>
<p>A: <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Contributors requesting a refund will have to reach out to your team directly (via contact@fotokite.com). We will refund your pledge minus the fees that we paid to IGG/PP which is about 10%. </span></p>
<p><i>Q: What will be the Fotokite Phi’s retail price?</i></p>
<p>A: We project the Fotokite Phi will retail for around US$500.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Q: What's up with shipping to Switzerland?</i></p>
<p>A: Shipping to Switzerland is $40, same as EU. While the Phi is developed and designed in Switzerland, final assembly is done elsewhere (most likely Hungary or China), due to pretty clear-cut cost/sourcing constraints. So we have to get the units shipped to Switzerland just like to any other place. Yes, making stuff and shipping it costs something -- we're being upfront with you rather than having one more excuse to not deliver on time later. Perhaps one day these guys will fly themselves to you for free ;-)</p>
<p><b>2. Product</b></p>
<p><i>Q: Why does the Fotokite Phi have a tether?</i></p>
<p>A: That's how the Fotokite knows where it is: the tether is always taut, and by ""seeing"" the tension force for Fotokite can maintain a stable position next to you. In addition, the tether solves fundamental interaction and safety problems: more an intelligent kite than a drone, it provides novel interaction (five-minute training) and clear accountability.</p>
<p><i>Q: Would it have the same effect if I attached a tether to another drone?</i></p>
<p>A:  No, it wouldn’t, nor would the Fotokite Phi work without the tether - it is core to how the Phi operates: Instead of relying on a GPS or radio signal for localization/control the Phi uses the tension force from the tether to figure out where it is. This means controlled flight no matter where you are: it is a completely self-contained system. </p>
<p><i>Q: How long can the Fotokite Phi stay in the air?</i></p>
<p>A: The current prototypes fly for around 8-10 mins. (We've had to make the prototype batteries smaller as some prototype components, e.g. electronics and frame, are currently heavier than planned). We aim for 15min minimum for production units. Note that flight time may vary depending on conditions (e.g. windy conditions --&gt; generally lower flight time). The batteries are in-field swappable.</p>
<p><i>Q: How can the Fotokite Phi follow me during flight?</i></p>
<p>A: Thanks to its embedded sensors, the Fotokite Phi constantly measures the angle of the tether relative to you. The Phi's world is literally centered on its user -- so when you move, it naturally moves with you. </p>
<p><i>Q: How does the Fotokite Phi behave in wind or rain?</i></p>
<p>A: Wind: The Fotokite will not crash; it will fight the wind. However, very windy conditions may affect the stability of the video footage.</p>
<p>Rain: While the Fotokite works in light rain, we would not recommend using the Phi in serious ""wet"" conditions. The folding mechanism makes splash-proofing difficult, though we're keeping this in mind. We do not recommend operating the Fotokite Phi during rainy weather.</p>
<p><i>Q: Do you support night filming?</i></p>
<p>A: The Fotokite Phi is visible in the dark, as it is equipped with flashing LEDs at the front. Therefore, you always know where the Fotokite is in the air and how it is oriented. The definition of night shots will depend on the GoPro camera’s definition and ground luminosity.</p>
<p><i>Q: How long is the leash?</i></p>
<p>A: Currently, the Fotokite Phi’s smart leash is 8 meters (26ft) long.</p>
<p><i>Q: What are its safety features?</i></p>
<p>A: The tether is the first and most important safety feature: no fly-away scenarios! The system is very lightweight and uses flexible plastic rotor blades, <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/3ZMVP7zBJM/?taken-by=fotokite"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">safer than usual propellers</a>. In addition, if one of the four motors stops, they will all stop, preventing the blades from spinning against something. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Finally, the entire system is also extremely lightweight (~12oz), reducing the chances of serious accidents.</span></p>
<p><i>Q: What happens if the tether is cut / the battery runs out?</i></p>
<p>A: On empty battery / tether break detect the Phi goes into a ""controlled descent"" mode, where it comes back to the ground quickly, but gently. </p>
<p><i>Q: What are the legal restrictions for flying the Fotokite Phi?</i></p>
<p>A: We strongly encourage flying responsibly. Thanks to its tether, the Fotokite is welcomed by safety experts as a safe, reliable way to access aerial perspectives, especially near crowds. The Fotokite has been exempted from aviation regulators in both Switzerland and France. However, legal restrictions vary from country to country, so we recommend to always checking your country’s regulations of your country. A good source for flying in the United States is <a href=""http://knowbeforeyoufly.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Know Before You Fly</a>.</p>
<p><b>3. Company</b></p>
<p><i>Q: When was your company founded?</i></p>
<p>A: <a href=""http://fotokite.com/#about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perspective Robotics</a> was founded in March 2014. The company grew out of a research team from ETH Zurich, one of the world’s leading universities for technology and natural sciences. The core algorithms for our products were developed and refined over three years of PhD work at the <a href=""http://www.flyingmachinearena.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flying Machine Arena</a> at ETH Zurich, and are protected by a patent application.</p>
<p><i>Q: What’s your track record in the field of robotics or drones?</i></p>
<p>A: Our first product, the <a href=""http://fotokite.com/#fotokite"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fotokite Pro</a>, was developed in 2014. It is designed for professional news broadcasting. Key players in this field have tested and bought our products.</p>
<p><i>Q: Why are you crowdfunding?</i></p>
<p>A: We are almost ready to start manufacturing the Fotokite Phi on a commercial scale. But before that, we need to raise funds to generate plastic moulds so we can produce the Fotokite Phi in large quantities at a reasonable price. Your pre-orders will help pay for the moulds and confirm for us that people really do care about simple, safe and affordable aerial photography.</p>

</div></div>","The Fotokite Phi is designed to get your birds-eye perspectives as painlessly as possible. Lightweight at 12oz (350g) and folding to the size of a thermos, you can throw the Phi into your backpack and bring it anywhere. Take it out, unfold it, point in the direction you'd like it to fly, and it'll fly there like a kite. Capture aerial photos and videos elegantly, safely and quickly, before the moment is gone.The Fotokite Phi's novel technology allows it to fly itself without any control from you. No piloting skills required - fly immediately without waiting for a GPS lock or having to do calibrations.  Once in the air, our unique smart leash lets you use gestures to adjust the orientation and position of the Fotokite in the sky.

Immediate intuitive launch (turn on, point, give it a twist and let go)
Easy gesture control via the smart leash. The Phi mirrors the motion of the smart leash. Alternatively, control the Phi from an Android device for precise framing.
Unlike conventional drones, any bystander has immediate visual feedback about who is responsible for the Phi, making it a significantly friendlier device.









We built the Phi for the hobby photographer, the action sports enthusiast, the guerrilla journalist and the gadget aficionado. 
Thanks to its small size and foldability, you can take the Fotokite Phi anywhere – whether you’re hiking in the mountains, going to a festival, visiting an archaeological site or sledding.

To explore the Fotokite Phi’s possibilities, we invited some of our friends to take it for a spin: 
Here is a shot from Fotokite at the Burning Man festival in Nevada:

As a photographer, you can capture stunning images of a wedding, as shown here:
Or you are just having some fun with it and go sledding with the Fotokite (we didn't plan this, just happened to have a Fotokite in the right place, at the right moment):








In the coming months, we will be tackling tasks in different parallel workstreams: design, development and production.

We are dedicated to our timeline and will keep you regularly updated on the status of our progress. We are also committed to transparency and keeping our Fotokite Phi fans and Indiegogo backers informed.


Fotokite was born with one mission: making aerial photography accessible to everyone. Our dedicated team combines skills and experience in robotic engineering, electronics and industrial design to build the Fotokite Phi. 




The Fotokite was born at ETH Zurich’s Flying Machine Arena, one of the world's most advanced research lab in aerial robotics.

<p><b>                                                    INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States,
affecting more than 40 million Americans annually. Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is
characterized by blackheads, whiteheads, pimples and deeper lumps (cysts or
nodules) that occur on the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and upper arms. Acne
often causes significant physical and psychological problems such as permanent
scarring, poor self-image, depression and anxiety.</p>
</div><div>
<p>In addition to the
embarrassment acne sufferers’ must endure, these are some of the side effects:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Swelling</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Irritated skin</p>
<p><span>·<span>

</span></span>Itchiness</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Pain</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Discomfort</p>
<p>All these side
effects ultimately leave an acne sufferer desperate to terminate the pimples
continued development and prematurely pop the pimple. Unfortunately, there is no existing “at
home” products on the market that provide a means to effectively prematurely
pop a developing pimple. Therefore, a traditional approach taken by acne sufferers’ to
prematurely pop a developing pimple is to forcefully squeeze and pop it. The
problem with this approach however is that the force used to prematurely pop the pimple
causes the surface skin to be abruptly stretched, and is left torn and mangle.
Resulting in acne scars!</p>

What is The Cricket ?

The stealthiest silent alarm for bikes. When someone as much as touches your bikes, you'll get an instant (as in one tenth of a second instant) notification in your smart phone.
If the worst happens and your bike are stolen, Cricket can hunt down your bikes using it's cloud based system to ensure a swift recovery.




Your first line of defense - a small, lightweight silent alarm for your bikes. When combined with our free iPhone app, it allows you to sit back, enjoy and know your beloved bikes are safe where you left them.
The Cricket uses low-power Bluetooth communications with a range of up to 150 feet and works for years without replacing the battery or switching  the device on/off.

How does it work ?



You simply attach the cricket to your bikes, underneath the seat for instance and download the free app.
That's it, from now on, all you have to do is activate the cricket on your mobile phone.

</dt>
<dl>
<dt><p>Frederic, Paul and Nicole, the owners of the company ""ErgoMot Belgium"",  have developed a new <b>spectacular LED product</b>
	last 6 months: <b>the ErgoMot ""Rollin'
	Eyes"".</b><br/><br/><font>These will be <b>the
automotive LED accent lights of the future</b>. </font></p></dt>
<dt><font>Indeed, it will
	be <b>you</b>
	who determines <b>what will be shown</b>
	on <b>your</b>
	LED's, via <b>your Smartphone</b>.
	It will be <b>you</b>
	who can choose <b>what effects will play
	on your vehicle</b>, in what colors,
	order, speed, repeat, etc.<br/><br/>Once you will have created <b>your
	own beautiful light show </b>(99 steps
	possible) on your phone and uploaded over Bluetooth to your vehicle,
	you can <b>share your show with your
	friends</b>, supposed they also have a
	set of Rollin' Eyes on the vehicle.<br/><br/>Tuning, Light Shows and
	<b>Lightparades will be totally
	different</b>. <br/></font></dt>
<dt><br/></dt>
<dt><font><b>YOU
	will expose your own light show</b>,
	created on the screen of your phone, <b>different
	from all the others</b> who have
	standard tiny lights, which everybody already has. That's what we
	call “<b>Show Mode</b>”.<br/><br/><b>On
	the street, while driving</b>, you can
	use the Rollin' Eyes in ""<b>Street
	Mode</b>"". The LED's will be white,
	ultra bright, strobe white or orange/amber in <b>the
	front</b>, red, ultra bright strobe red
	or orange/amber <b>in the back</b>,
	just following the <b>existing signal
	lights</b> of your bike, car, truck...</font></dt>
<dt><font><br/></font></dt>
<dt><font>“Street mode” is easy, just <b>connect
	some wires</b> from the controller to
	the existing wires on your vehicle (by easy Posi Tap's).<br/></font></dt>

<dt><font>We
	now ask for <b>your support</b>!
	You can help in 2 different ways :<br/><br/>- by sharing with <b>other
	people</b> who love modern, spectacular
	LED lights on <b>car, truck or
	motorcycle</b>.<br/><br/>- by <b>choosing
	a ""Perk""</b> ( a reward ) for
	your <b>contribution (</b>via
	PayPal or Credit Card). It is <b>now 15
	to 25% cheaper</b> then it will be as
	from March in the shops. ErgoMot can be trusted, we have been on the
	market for several years now, with the <a href=""http://ergomot.be/cms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">electric
	windshield X-Screen</a> and other stuff. We are <b>already
	sure now</b>, it will be possible to
	start <b>first delivery</b>
	by the end of March, even when we do not reach our funding
	goal.<br/><br/><b>Why does ErgoMot need
	your support</b>? <br/></font></dt>
<dt><font><br/></font></dt>
<dt><font>To bring a new LED
	product to the international market is <b>very
	expensive and difficult nowadays</b>.</font></dt>
<dt><font><br/></font></dt>
<dt><font>We developed and tested the product, done,
	it works fine! <br/></font></dt>
<dt><font><br/></font></dt>
<dt><font>But we need some extra tools like better molds and
	for sure, <b>we need good marketing</b>. One thing in the marketing is better video material<font>.</font></font></dt>
<dt>
<font>
</font><br/>
</dt>
<dt><font>This product is <b>something
	really NEW</b>: total control over your
	LED's on<b> your Bluetooth Smartphone</b>
	(currently on Android, iPhone in some weeks). That is why ErgoMot introduces the product
	at a <b>special ""launch"" price</b>
	on Indiegogo.<br/><br/>You can already verify the future price in the
	future webshop: <a href=""http://ergomot.be/shop/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=66"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ergomot.be/shop</a><br/></font></dt>
<dt><br/></dt>
<dt><font><b>But for now, buy it from <a href=""http://igg.me/at/rollin/x/5868488"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo</a>

<font>Half a year ago, Frederic <strong>had a dream!</strong> He wanted some <strong>'spectacular'</strong> new lights on his motorcycle and was looking for the well known “Angel Eyes” and “Demon Eyes”, but was not pleased with the result. He also had a look all to the existing LED strips, but was not happy with the stupid little remote control, never doing what he wanted.</font>
<p><font>So, we started a new project, to give him full satisfaction :-)</font></p>
<p><font>Paul started experimenting with Android &amp; microprocessor controlled LED lights … Frederic started tooling and design... Nicole made some funds available and … here is the result <strong>you can benefit</strong> from!</font></p>

<p><font>OK, let's be honest, there are thousands of LED lights on the market. A few of them are very interesting with very nice features. But even the best led rings or strips work with a simple remote control, like the one you use for opening your garage door. Every click you give on the remote brings another light effect, but rarely what you want. Nothing to do, you have to click and click again and see all effect you DO NOT like, before you reach some you like, but than it is the wrong color at the wrong speed … annoying … After power down, you have to start again, try to find that one setting you did like, by clicking the remote like hell ...<br/></font></p>

<p><font>With our Rollin' Eyes, <strong>you are in charge</strong>! Even before one led lights up, choose what you want, at the speed you want, in the color of your mood … all with the easy of using a smartphone. </font></p>
<p><font>And next time you switch on the ignition or the power, forget about those thousand annoying clicks on the remote for which you forgot which of the 4 buttons did what :-)</font></p>
<p><font>Yes ! We are aware some things like this already exists, allowing you to switch LED's on and off and change the color via a phone ... <b>But not able to record, play and share your own show.</b><br/></font></p>
<p><font>To make sure your light show or signals will be seen (<strong>think about your and others safety</strong>) we integrated our own real optical system in the rings. <br/></font></p>

<h1><font color=""#0000ff""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317182/files/20140119062023-RE_logo_35.png?1390141223"" src="""" style=""""/>How to use ?</font></h1>
<p><font>RE can be used in 2 modes :</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font>street mode </font></li>
<li><font>show mode </font></li>
</ul>
<h2><font color=""#990000"">Street mode :</font></h2>
<p><font>Street mode depends on the use of the <strong>6 colored wires coming out of the controller</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font>The 6 wires are supposed to be connected to your vehicle signals : blinkers left and right, cruise light, tail light and brake light. </font></p>
<p><font>The 6th wire can be connected to a simple switch on steering wheel or handle bar (switch not included) or you could connect to eg. the alarm output. </font></p>
<p><font>When one of those wires “feels” +12 volt on the vehicle signal, the RE ring / strip will “imitate” the signal. E.g. when the red wire is connected to your brake lights, the RE will light up in bright red and will produce a “Brake Light modulator” effect. </font></p>
<p><font>The yellow wires connect to your blinkers left and right. The RE will blink orange or, up to you, will produce a “Mustang” effect, rolling left or right. <br/></font></p>
<p><font>Via the app on your phone, you can change what the wires will do (configure in the setup screen).<br/></font></p>
<p><font>The 6th wire is intended to be used as a ""warning"" and you can select via your phone or tablet what light effect it will show. </font></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdC53MrahNh8&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><font><br/></font><p></p>
<h2><font color=""#990000"">Show mode :</font></h2>
<p><font>In our <strong>free app</strong>, you will find many pre-programmed light effects. It is a list on the top half of your screen. </font></p>
<p><font>You select the effects you like, in the order you want. <strong>Just tap your finger on the effect name you want</strong>. </font></p>
<p><font>Each time you tap on a name, it will be <strong>added at the bottom</strong> of a second list, on the bottom half of your screen. That will become <strong>your show</strong>. </font></p>
<p><font>You can easily <strong>customize each effect</strong> : color(s), speed, number of repeats, running direction (left / right), etc. </font></p>
<p><font>Of course, when you make a mistake, you can delete effects from your choice list, or even insert one if you forgot one. </font></p>
<p><font>Once you are satisfied, just connect to the RE controller over Bluetooth and upload your own light-show. </font></p>
<p><font>And there you are : <strong>your light-show runs and runs again</strong>. Even after you cut and reconnect the power, the show will start again. When you make a better version, you can upload it again.<br/></font></p>
<p><font>Last bot not least : save your show in a file, share the file with your friends, they can upload in their own RE device!<br/></font></p>
<h1><font color=""#0000ff""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/317182/files/20140119062023-RE_logo_35.png?1390141223"" src="""" style=""""/>Share with your friends : </font></h1>
<p><font>Whenever you made a nice show, you can save it on your phone or tablet, you can give it a file name. That file, you can send to your friends, they can upload it to their own Rollin' Eyes. Ideal if you contribute to events as ""Light Parades"" or ""Light Shows"" or ""Tuning"" events!  <br/></font></p>

<p><font>Inside the controller is a power converter, a micro processor and a bluetooth module. Some simple electronics are added to connect everything and regulate the signals.</font></p>
<p><font>The DC-DC switching power converter is making a stable 5 volt out of your +- 12 volt battery or adaptor, without heat. The 5 amp 5 volt drives the led's in your RE ring or strip.</font></p>
<p><font>The 12 volt also feeds a quick powerful microprocessor. The microprocessor listens to the Bluetooth module and keeps an eye on the 5 input wires.</font></p>
<p><font>Whenever your phone / tablet sends a new program (selected by you in our free app) the microprocessor stores your program in his own, on board permanent memory.</font></p>
<p><font>Depending on the commands coming from your phone / tablet and eventually from the signal wires, the microprocessor sends digital data to each individual led, over one single data wire, millions of instructions per second.</font></p>
<p><font>Each led in the ring or strip has her own very tiny processor built in and shows the color and the intensity demanded by the master microprocessor.</font></p>
<p><font>Sounds all easy :-) but it took us more than 6 months to make it work :-)</font></p>

<h2><font color=""#990000"">on a vehicle </font></h2>
<p><font>Measure very carefully what size of ring / strip you will need. The rings are intended to fit around existing lights (eg. around fog lights).</font></p>
<p><font>Rings do have a outer and a inner diameter, also a “depth” … make sure what you need before choosing your perk.</font></p>
<p><font>Rings have to be put on with silicone gel. Best to use transparent silicone, like for bathroom and plumbing.</font></p>
<p><font>Strips have a self adhesive backing. Clean the surface well before applying the strip (eg. With alcohol).</font></p>
<p><font>Strips and rings have a 3 pin connector. It fits or to the RE controller or to our extension cables.</font></p>
<p><font>Find a suitable dry place for the RE controller and secure it with silicone gel or with tie wraps.</font></p>
<p><font>Route the (extention) cabling from each RE Ring or strip to the controller and click it in one of the free connectors.</font></p>
<p><font>Eventually (when you want to use street mode) connect the thin colored signal wires :</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font>yellow wires to the blinkers left and right </font></li>
<li><font>the orange wire to the tail light </font></li>
<li><font>the white wire to the cruise lights  </font></li>
<li><font>the red wire to the brake lights </font></li>
<li><font>the purple wire to some 'attention' switch or alarm<br/></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font>Finaly : connect the controller's big RED wire to +12 volt (in a vehicle, over the ignition switch). Connect the big black wire to ground (- 12 volt). If you do not install in a 12 volt vehicle, you will need a power adaptor.</font></p>
<p><font>When there is NO power to one or more of the signal wires : A demo program will start.</font></p>
<p><font>With power to one or more of the signal wires : your rings or strips will start acting to what the controller 'feels' on the wires ... <br/></font></p>
<p><font>Use our free RE app on your smartphone or tablet to change the demo program. <br/></font></p>
<p><em><font color=""#ff0000"">ATTENTION : connecting / disconnecting the RE ring or strip may only be done when there is NO power to the controller ! Making or braking the connection between controller and ring / strip, while the conroller has power, will PERMANENTLY damage ring or strip!</font></em></p>
<p><font><em><font color=""#ff0000"">ATTENTION : connecting / disconnecting the signal wires may only be done when there is NO power to the controller ! Making or braking the connection between signal wires and vehicle and or switches, while the controller has power, may PERMANENTLY damage the RE controller!</font></em></font></p>
<p><font><em></em></font></p>
<h2>
<font color=""#990000"">other applications (no vehicle)</font> </h2>
<p><font>Follow the 'vehicle' installation instructions. </font></p>
<p><font>When there is NO 12 volt battery power, make sure you have a good 12 volt DC (NOT AC) power adapter, able to deliver 12 volt DC regulated with minimal 2 amp contineous (better is 5 ampere) current.</font></p>
<p><font>Altough you will not have blinkers, brake lights, etc. , you still can use the 6 wires to connect to various contacts delivering 12 volt on the signal wires. You could eg. have 6 switches connected to the PLUS of your power supply at one side and to one of the signal wires from the orther side. When you press a switch, you will see one of the six effects.</font></p>
<p><font>But ... without vehicle, use the show mode! Your smartphone with our RE app will modify the demo program, make your own light show !</font></p>
<p><font>Anyway : first connect rings or strips to the controller, connect (eventualy) +12 volt lines to the colored wires.  </font></p>
<p><font>When everything connected : connect the controllers big RED wire to PLUS 12 volt . Connect the big
black wire to ground (MINUS 12 volt). <br/></font></p>
<p><em><font color=""#ff0000"">ATTENTION : connecting /
disconnecting the RE ring or strip may only be done when there is NO
power to the controller ! Making or braking the connection between
controller and ring / strip, while the conroller has power, will

<p><font><em><font color=""#ff0000"">ATTENTION : connecting /

<dt>After initial design for Honda Goldwing, we will start development for other vehicles. The first one will be on the famous Ford F150.</dt>
<dd><br/></dd>
<dt><p><font>The current controller will allow 90 steps in your own light show and has 35 , built in, light effect. You can customize the effects on your phone. <br/></font></p></dt>
<dt>
<p><font>After the first launch and delivery, we plan a larger version, where you can have +200 steps in your light show and where we can do +- 99 pre programmed light effects. <br/></font></p>
<p><font>We also think future customers will ask for other sizes and shapes! This has already been integrated in our production facility and we will bring what the market asks for.</font></p>
<p><font>We are also investigating the possibility of hooking up 2 controllers, to be controlled over one single bluetooth and inter controller communication.</font></p>

<font>On a vehicle, typical you can use 1 or 2. The best is to have one controller for the front and one for the rear.</font>
<p><font>The front controller can drive rings/strips in the headlights and/or around fog lights, the rear controller could do rings/strips around the blinkers or strips in the bumper or spoiler or ... let your immagination flow ?</font></p>

<h2> </h2>
<p><font>Safe? <br/></font></p>
</dt>
<dt>
<p><font>YES! Been seen is always safe. Electrical safe? YES! Runs primary on 12 volt, rings and strips on 5 volt. No risk in that!</font></p>
<p><font>Legal on a vehicle? <br/></font></p>
</dt>
<dt><p><font>in ""Street Mode"" : YES!</font></p></dt>
<dt><p><font>In STREET mode (imitating the signals of your vehicle and acting as daytime running light) there is a great chance nobody will bother about. <br/></font></p></dt>
<dt>
<p><font>In ""Show Mode"", for sure, when you choose lighet effects like ""US Police"" or ""EU Police"" on your smartphone and you drive along with such effect running ... well, unless you ARE the police, they will not like it. Show mode is intended as SHOW, NOT to drive around with. Be smart, think about your own safety, check local regulations first ...</font></p>
<p><font>As a last remark : when the LED's are OFF, they have a <strong>pure white color</strong>. It's under power and control they change to those heavy bright colors. So, when OFF, nobody will be able to judge what color was on before.</font></p>

 New Sub Projects.


We first started the Rollin' Eyes project on Honda Goldwing GL1800, but now, we are expanding to different vehicles.
The first one will be Rollin' Eyes on Ford F150, a special halo around HID Projectors and a special halo ring around the Fog Lights. 

Our RE halo will be multicolour, high intensity, it can be used legal on the road in ""street mode"" and off road, in ""show mode"", like the example YouTube above on a Goldwing cowling.

""Street mode"" will be intense White DRL and will become Orange when blinkers are on (left or right). In ""show mode"" you can customise the show with your smartphone.


     More vehicles will follow ... eg. Goldwing 1500 : 





If you like what you see, make your contribution now, it is 15% to 25% cheaper than the suggested retail price after March 14. Perks are INcluding international shipping.

What are “Rollin' Eyes”?


Frederic, Paul and Nicole, the owners of the company ""ErgoMot Belgium"",  have developed a new spectacular LED product
	last 6 months: the ErgoMot ""Rollin'
	Eyes"".These will be the
automotive LED accent lights of the future. 
Indeed, it will
	be you
	who determines what will be shown
	on your
	LED's, via your Smartphone.
	It will be you
	who can choose what effects will play
	on your vehicle, in what colors,
	order, speed, repeat, etc.Once you will have created your
	own beautiful light show (99 steps
	possible) on your phone and uploaded over Bluetooth to your vehicle,
	you can share your show with your
	friends, supposed they also have a
	set of Rollin' Eyes on the vehicle.Tuning, Light Shows and
	Lightparades will be totally
	different. 

YOU
	will expose your own light show,
	created on the screen of your phone, different
	from all the others who have
	standard tiny lights, which everybody already has. That's what we
	call “Show Mode”.On
	the street, while driving, you can
	use the Rollin' Eyes in ""Street
	Mode"". The LED's will be white,
	ultra bright, strobe white or orange/amber in the
	front, red, ultra bright strobe red
	or orange/amber in the back,
	just following the existing signal
	lights of your bike, car, truck...

“Street mode” is easy, just connect
	some wires from the controller to
	the existing wires on your vehicle (by easy Posi Tap's).

the Android app is already available (free) in the Google Play Store : 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rollin.eyes.led
The iPhone app will follow in due time.

We
	now ask for your support!
	You can help in 2 different ways :- by sharing with other
	people who love modern, spectacular
	LED lights on car, truck or
	motorcycle.- by choosing
	a ""Perk"" ( a reward ) for
	your contribution (via
	PayPal or Credit Card). It is now 15
	to 25% cheaper then it will be as
	from March in the shops. ErgoMot can be trusted, we have been on the
	market for several years now, with the electric
	windshield X-Screen and other stuff. We are already
	sure now, it will be possible to
	start first delivery
	by the end of March, even when we do not reach our funding
	goal.Why does ErgoMot need
	your support? 

To bring a new LED
	product to the international market is very
	expensive and difficult nowadays.

We developed and tested the product, done,
	it works fine! 

But we need some extra tools like better molds and
	for sure, we need good marketing. One thing in the marketing is better video material.




This product is something
	really NEW: total control over your
	LED's on your Bluetooth Smartphone
	(currently on Android, iPhone in some weeks). That is why ErgoMot introduces the product
	at a special ""launch"" price
	on Indiegogo.You can already verify the future price in the
	future webshop: ergomot.be/shop

But for now, buy it from Indiegogo
	, it saves you a lot of money and gives ErgoMot the funds to market
	it as a real great product!




Thank you!


    
Both rings and strips come in a variety of sizes.  Absolutely NO technical knowledge is required to install and use!

Let your imagination flow and use them where ever you need special light effects.

Short History
Half a year ago, Frederic had a dream! He wanted some 'spectacular' new lights on his motorcycle and was looking for the well known “Angel Eyes” and “Demon Eyes”, but was not pleased with the result. He also had a look all to the existing LED strips, but was not happy with the stupid little remote control, never doing what he wanted.
So, we started a new project, to give him full satisfaction :-)
Paul started experimenting with Android & microprocessor controlled LED lights … Frederic started tooling and design... Nicole made some funds available and … here is the result you can benefit from!
Quick Facts
2 operation modes 

street / show 

Pre Programmed user selectable light effects

currently +- 30 effects ready, number growing every day 

User adaptable light effects


select what light-effects you want, 
in the order, orientation, color and speed you want 


12 volt power supply (car / bike / battery or 12v power adaptor)

11 to 16 volt will do 

Free Android App (Apple app under investigation)

Apple development funding is one of the reasons we are on IndieGoGo 

Built in Bluetooth module

To upload your choice to the LED's from your BT phone or tablet

6 signal tap wires 


to hook up to blinkers, cruise, brake and tail light 
if you only need show, no need to connect them 


2 plugs for RE ring or strip


one at the left, 
one at the right, 
but you can use just one 


Each plug can drive 2 rings or strips

So, you can connect 4 rings / strips to one controller 

Each plug can drive 144 LED's in total

Gives really very much, intense, bright light ! 

Rings and strips have many LED's (+- 1,5 led / centimeter or +- 3,75 led / inch)

That is the highest density in industry right now 

Very easy to use

If you can manage your contacts in your phone, it's OK ! 

Unique features and design
OK, let's be honest, there are thousands of LED lights on the market. A few of them are very interesting with very nice features. But even the best led rings or strips work with a simple remote control, like the one you use for opening your garage door. Every click you give on the remote brings another light effect, but rarely what you want. Nothing to do, you have to click and click again and see all effect you DO NOT like, before you reach some you like, but than it is the wrong color at the wrong speed … annoying … After power down, you have to start again, try to find that one setting you did like, by clicking the remote like hell ...
OK, STOP!
With our Rollin' Eyes, you are in charge! Even before one led lights up, choose what you want, at the speed you want, in the color of your mood … all with the easy of using a smartphone. 
And next time you switch on the ignition or the power, forget about those thousand annoying clicks on the remote for which you forgot which of the 4 buttons did what :-)
Yes ! We are aware some things like this already exists, allowing you to switch LED's on and off and change the color via a phone ... But not able to record, play and share your own show.
To make sure your light show or signals will be seen (think about your and others safety) we integrated our own real optical system in the rings. 
the free app ?





How to use ?
RE can be used in 2 modes :

street mode 
show mode 

Street mode :
Street mode depends on the use of the 6 colored wires coming out of the controller.
The 6 wires are supposed to be connected to your vehicle signals : blinkers left and right, cruise light, tail light and brake light. 
The 6th wire can be connected to a simple switch on steering wheel or handle bar (switch not included) or you could connect to eg. the alarm output. 
When one of those wires “feels” +12 volt on the vehicle signal, the RE ring / strip will “imitate” the signal. E.g. when the red wire is connected to your brake lights, the RE will light up in bright red and will produce a “Brake Light modulator” effect. 
The yellow wires connect to your blinkers left and right. The RE will blink orange or, up to you, will produce a “Mustang” effect, rolling left or right. 
Via the app on your phone, you can change what the wires will do (configure in the setup screen).
The 6th wire is intended to be used as a ""warning"" and you can select via your phone or tablet what light effect it will show. 
Show mode :
In our free app, you will find many pre-programmed light effects. It is a list on the top half of your screen. 
You select the effects you like, in the order you want. Just tap your finger on the effect name you want. 
Each time you tap on a name, it will be added at the bottom of a second list, on the bottom half of your screen. That will become your show. 
You can easily customize each effect : color(s), speed, number of repeats, running direction (left / right), etc. 
Of course, when you make a mistake, you can delete effects from your choice list, or even insert one if you forgot one. 
Once you are satisfied, just connect to the RE controller over Bluetooth and upload your own light-show. 
And there you are : your light-show runs and runs again. Even after you cut and reconnect the power, the show will start again. When you make a better version, you can upload it again.
Last bot not least : save your show in a file, share the file with your friends, they can upload in their own RE device!
Share with your friends : 
Whenever you made a nice show, you can save it on your phone or tablet, you can give it a file name. That file, you can send to your friends, they can upload it to their own Rollin' Eyes. Ideal if you contribute to events as ""Light Parades"" or ""Light Shows"" or ""Tuning"" events!  
How does it work ?
Inside the controller is a power converter, a micro processor and a bluetooth module. Some simple electronics are added to connect everything and regulate the signals.
The DC-DC switching power converter is making a stable 5 volt out of your +- 12 volt battery or adaptor, without heat. The 5 amp 5 volt drives the led's in your RE ring or strip.
The 12 volt also feeds a quick powerful microprocessor. The microprocessor listens to the Bluetooth module and keeps an eye on the 5 input wires.
Whenever your phone / tablet sends a new program (selected by you in our free app) the microprocessor stores your program in his own, on board permanent memory.
Depending on the commands coming from your phone / tablet and eventually from the signal wires, the microprocessor sends digital data to each individual led, over one single data wire, millions of instructions per second.
Each led in the ring or strip has her own very tiny processor built in and shows the color and the intensity demanded by the master microprocessor.
Sounds all easy :-) but it took us more than 6 months to make it work :-)
Where are we now ?
Ready to go!
UPDATE : Feb. 22nd. 

We have completed the industrial design - and spent months of testing, using prototypes and refining Rollin' Eyes from great to delightful.
We are ready to start final production March 15th.
The controller is full functional, some pre production units already run 24hrs a day in test, successfully.
The Android app is ready for 99% and is tested by the team members every day. The Android app is available on the Google Play Store.  
The Apple (IOS) app is done for 65% and will be ready in +- 10 days.
The strips exist in different sizes, some pre production units already run 24hrs a day in test, successfully. 
The rings exist in 4 sizes, the pre production units do run 24hrs a day in test, successfully.
What has to be done?
What's the campaign money for? 

UPDATE : Feb. 22nd.


Test, test and test again.
Finish the app for Apple (iOS).
Develop international marketing.
Develop specialised shapes fitting more vehicles.




Installation instructions 
on a vehicle 
Measure very carefully what size of ring / strip you will need. The rings are intended to fit around existing lights (eg. around fog lights).
Rings do have a outer and a inner diameter, also a “depth” … make sure what you need before choosing your perk.
Rings have to be put on with silicone gel. Best to use transparent silicone, like for bathroom and plumbing.
Strips have a self adhesive backing. Clean the surface well before applying the strip (eg. With alcohol).
Strips and rings have a 3 pin connector. It fits or to the RE controller or to our extension cables.
Find a suitable dry place for the RE controller and secure it with silicone gel or with tie wraps.
Route the (extention) cabling from each RE Ring or strip to the controller and click it in one of the free connectors.
Eventually (when you want to use street mode) connect the thin colored signal wires :

yellow wires to the blinkers left and right 
the orange wire to the tail light 
the white wire to the cruise lights  
the red wire to the brake lights 
the purple wire to some 'attention' switch or alarm

Finaly : connect the controller's big RED wire to +12 volt (in a vehicle, over the ignition switch). Connect the big black wire to ground (- 12 volt). If you do not install in a 12 volt vehicle, you will need a power adaptor.
When there is NO power to one or more of the signal wires : A demo program will start.
With power to one or more of the signal wires : your rings or strips will start acting to what the controller 'feels' on the wires ... 
Use our free RE app on your smartphone or tablet to change the demo program. 
ATTENTION : connecting / disconnecting the RE ring or strip may only be done when there is NO power to the controller ! Making or braking the connection between controller and ring / strip, while the conroller has power, will PERMANENTLY damage ring or strip!
ATTENTION : connecting / disconnecting the signal wires may only be done when there is NO power to the controller ! Making or braking the connection between signal wires and vehicle and or switches, while the controller has power, may PERMANENTLY damage the RE controller!


other applications (no vehicle) 
Follow the 'vehicle' installation instructions. 
When there is NO 12 volt battery power, make sure you have a good 12 volt DC (NOT AC) power adapter, able to deliver 12 volt DC regulated with minimal 2 amp contineous (better is 5 ampere) current.
Altough you will not have blinkers, brake lights, etc. , you still can use the 6 wires to connect to various contacts delivering 12 volt on the signal wires. You could eg. have 6 switches connected to the PLUS of your power supply at one side and to one of the signal wires from the orther side. When you press a switch, you will see one of the six effects.
But ... without vehicle, use the show mode! Your smartphone with our RE app will modify the demo program, make your own light show !
Anyway : first connect rings or strips to the controller, connect (eventualy) +12 volt lines to the colored wires.  
When everything connected : connect the controllers big RED wire to PLUS 12 volt . Connect the big
black wire to ground (MINUS 12 volt). 
ATTENTION : connecting /
disconnecting the RE ring or strip may only be done when there is NO
power to the controller ! Making or braking the connection between
controller and ring / strip, while the conroller has power, will
PERMANENTLY damage ring or strip!
ATTENTION : connecting /
disconnecting the signal wires may only be done when there is NO power
to the controller ! Making or braking the connection between signal
wires and vehicle and or switches, while the controller has power, may
PERMANENTLY damage the RE controller!

Future Plans. 
 

After initial design for Honda Goldwing, we will start development for other vehicles. The first one will be on the famous Ford F150.

The current controller will allow 90 steps in your own light show and has 35 , built in, light effect. You can customize the effects on your phone. 

After the first launch and delivery, we plan a larger version, where you can have +200 steps in your light show and where we can do +- 99 pre programmed light effects. 
We also think future customers will ask for other sizes and shapes! This has already been integrated in our production facility and we will bring what the market asks for.
We are also investigating the possibility of hooking up 2 controllers, to be controlled over one single bluetooth and inter controller communication.
How many will you need? 
 
On a vehicle, typical you can use 1 or 2. The best is to have one controller for the front and one for the rear.
The front controller can drive rings/strips in the headlights and/or around fog lights, the rear controller could do rings/strips around the blinkers or strips in the bumper or spoiler or ... let your immagination flow ?
Without vehicle ? Amaze us! Let us know what you will do with our RE, nice applications, we would like it on our website and in YouTube.
Safe? Legal? 
 
Safe? 


YES! Been seen is always safe. Electrical safe? YES! Runs primary on 12 volt, rings and strips on 5 volt. No risk in that!
Legal on a vehicle? 

in ""Street Mode"" : YES!
In STREET mode (imitating the signals of your vehicle and acting as daytime running light) there is a great chance nobody will bother about. 

In ""Show Mode"", for sure, when you choose lighet effects like ""US Police"" or ""EU Police"" on your smartphone and you drive along with such effect running ... well, unless you ARE the police, they will not like it. Show mode is intended as SHOW, NOT to drive around with. Be smart, think about your own safety, check local regulations first ...
As a last remark : when the LED's are OFF, they have a pure white color. It's under power and control they change to those heavy bright colors. So, when OFF, nobody will be able to judge what color was on before.
When to expect delivery? 
 
We start shipping out at latest end of March, beginning of April.
Risks and challenges.
 Update Feb 22nd.
We are almost funded ... Select your Perk in the column at the right, make your contribution now and our project is secured, thanks to you!The prototypes are running 24hrs a day, in freezing cold and burning hot environments, it works.

We are already well known in the Goldwing Motorcycle market (with our electric windshields and running lights) and all customers who have seen the prototypes glowing and blinking and rolling said : ""I want that on my bike"". So, we think we will start-up quickly. 
IF supporting us with money is NOT possible for you, which we understand, you still can support us by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter and Google. That also is a great value to us! THANK YOU VERY MUCH for your ""like"" or ""follow"" or ""+"". 



In conclusion...
Are you still reading ? Waaaauuuwww :-) 
Thanks for reading on! Yep, I know, it was a long document, but we wanted to be as open as possible.
If you love Rollin' Eyes, or just love to see our entrepreneurial spirit thrive, please help us get this amazing project off the ground.
Every €1 helps, and telling people helps too. Every Facebook like, Twitter follower or Google extra PLUS ... you know the drill...
Thank you for supporting the Rollin' Eyes project. The crazy LED Rings and Strips, showing YOUR light show, not ours.
 
FAQ 
What happens if you don't raise enough money?

Why did you choose 'Flexible Funding'? 

This is not our first project! We started this ""Rollin' Eyes"" thing as a private project, just to have ""amazing"" lights on our motorcycles, ourselves. Some customers have seen it in an early stage, when they were in our workshop to have an electric windshield installed. They ecouraged us to make this a public project ... on Indiegogo ...
We re almost funded! But, please continue to support us? It will make it possible to have a more powerful version.
That is why we ask YOU to contribute TODAY and to be proud YOU have been one of the people who made this all possible. Thank YOU ! 
I'm having trouble making my contribution payment.
We don't control the checkout process, that's our friends here at Indiegogo who run this site.
Please
note that some of the fields like 'Country' and 'State/Provice/Region'
aren't the usual pull-down menu but instead you just start typing to see
suggestions.
It usually works if you are careful and patient. If you you need more please email support@indiegogo.com
What should I add for shipping?
Simple. Nothing! 
Shipping is included.
We love simple things (like our Rollin' Eyes) and made very good agreements with our Shipping and Handling agent. Everybody at the same price. 
I can't wait! When will you ship?
We start shipping out at latest end of March, beginning of April. 
The faster we raise contributions the sooner we can commence the timeline from here to shipping. We have the intention to ship in the same order as the contributions came in. If you want to have one of the first devices : ... don't wait, choose your perk TODAY and make your contribution NOW! 

What if installed on lower part of a vehicle and hit by a stone?

Both rings and strips are made of high impact material, poly urethane for the lens in the ring, PVC and HIPS for casing and housing. It has to be a BIG stone before you will notice something.
When will you make one for my vehicle or application? I'd support you today if you did!
Thank you – that means a LOT to us.
There will already be different sizes of both rings and strips. With a little immagination, you could find a way to fit it. 
To
get a project like this off the ground requires a lot of focus. Even
big companies generally start out with a single version of a product,
both to keep inventory management managable and to learn what customers
really want before expanding.
We're looking forward to doing many other versions of Rollin' Eyes , please be patient while we get our first version flying. BUT : LET US KNOW WHAT YOU NEED and give us a view to how many other people could use your remark?
(And if you really love Rollin' Eyes  we'd be very grateful for a contribution even if you don't choose one of the current RE perks right now!)

I have a great idea for a new light effect.
Send us a message, describe what you dream about, we will try it!


I want to be 'dealer' , selling RE to my customers.


Perfect! No problem, we already have experience with our dealer network for our motorcycle parts! 
There are several 'dealer' perks ready for you. Have a look at the bottom of the perk column ?

My question is not in your FAQ!

No problem, we will be glad to answer you!

This product has the potential to be a real game changer, even iconic.
The Never Lose is a one of a kind that has people asking, ""Why hasn't this been done before?""  There is no other handheld device leash with these kind of features and benefits!
What We Need & What You Get
Never Lose needs to raise approximately $35,000 in order to start producing this product on a large scale. 
$15,000 is needed to begin the production process. The Never Lose will be manufactured and distributed on a large, wide scale map. 
Another $15,000 will be needed for the perks program.
The remaining money will be spent on the marketing and advertising of the product. Adding new brands and names to the lanyards as well as placing the product in phone stores and electronic stores.

</div></div>","Please note that, shipping fees of 15$, is only applied to buyers outside of France. Thank you ! 
In any case the watch will be produced !
VEA has experience with industrialization. Every contributor will have their Buddy !!

March 8th : Dear all, we are happy to announce that the campaign will be one more month. However, this will have no impact on June / summer shipping for the Vea Buddy.  
Here is the explanation: We’ve had many problems with Paypal Europe (who seems to don't know anything about crownfunding as they were refusing payments and kept on blocking our account for now 4 weeks) so we missed many contributions. For the best interest of Indiegogo (thanks guys for your help on the case), VEA Digital and the contributors, the campaign will go on until April, 30th.  Many thanks !

<p><strong>What is Skate King?</strong></p>
<p>Skate King is a finger skateboarding game for iPad, iPhone and Android devices. The player will control a finger board (one of those old school finger skateboards that all the cool kids played with at school). Players will be able to choose their skateboard deck and whichever pre-made skate park they want to ride in. It will be a top down view so the player can focus on busting out all the tricks they can (you will be looking at the skate board deck and a few feet around the board and all times). We have created several ramps and rails for the player to ride, as well as a half pipe, quarter pipe and swimming pools to ride in.</p>
<p><img alt=""View of the skate park"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/153/862/132d5cea85a6593ceb9b33fc572363fc_large.jpg?1347313943"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<ul>
<li>Players will be able to maneuver the board as if it were a real skateboard to perform dozens of different flips and grinds on the ramps and rails.</li>
<li>Different finger swipes and taps on the board will rotate and flip the board allowing for extreme trick variety.</li>
<li>Players will get a score that will let them unlock more decks, trucks, and wheels to customize their board.</li>
<li>Players can link multiple tricks together by using ramps and rails to perform long strings of tricks for a huge score.</li>
<li>
<strong>We will have a feature that no other skate game on a mobile device has</strong>: We will be creating a skate park editor so a player can make their own park from all the available ramps and rails in the game. They will be able to play in their skate parks as well as post them for their friends to play.</li>
<li>There will be a contest every week which will allow players to make a timed run through a skate park. In that 24 hour period that the contest runs, players get a practice run to get a feel for the park then they have 2 runs to attempt to get the highest score they can. The player with the highest score at the end of the day wins the contest and gets a special skate deck as a prize.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We currently have licensing agreements with 6 skateboard companies to use their logos (Etnies, Etnies Plus, Emerica, ES Footware, Thirtytwo, and Altamont) and we are in negotiations with several others for their logos as well as some of their skate decks. Some are waiting to sign until they have seen a beta version, but all of them are very interested in the game.</p>

<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>My role in the company is president and C.E.O, but also Art Director as well as the main artist. I have created all the skate park assets and models for the skateboards, as well as placed all the assets into the game engine we are using. We have several skate parks built and the money from Indiegogo will go towards getting a functioning prototype of the skate board controls. Any extra money we get will allow us to add more levels for players to choose from and add different kinds of ramps and different shaped rails from which players can choose to create their own park.</p>
<p><strong>Community Involvement</strong></p>
<p>We are donating 3% of our total game revenue to autism awareness and to <a href=""http://www.hiramfarm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hiramfarm.org/</a> .  It is an amazing cause and we would love to help out.</p>

<p>Hello and Thanks for checking out my campaign site to raise funds to launch a new era of local radio broadcasting :</p>
<p>                       Monadnock Internet Radio/MIRadiostation.com </p>
<p>Some of you know that for the past 30 years I worked in the radio business. First, as a music DJ, a news reporter, and as a Talk Show Host. I don’t need to tell you that there have been many changes in radio broadcasting over the years. The most obvious one is the increasing lack of local programming reflecting the needs of the local community and an increasing emphasis and use of nationally syndicated programming, by large corporate radio groups.</p>
<p>The fund raising campaign will allow me to provide another venue or platform for local and regional news, information and conversation here in the Monadnock Region of New Hampshire, with a reach going far beyond the borders, via the internet.  As a contributor to this project, you will not only help raise the needed funds for internet broadcast equipment, you will be giving yourself and your neighbors a choice in how news and information is received in the digital age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get </p>
<p>I have determined a fund raising goal of $6000 .The money raised through contributions will help with the purchase of specific equipment needed for internet broadcasting. Specifically, for the design of a dedicated web site, “MIRadiostation.com.”  audio streaming services enabling live broadcasts, additional computer storage for archived and pre-recorded programs, telephone interface hardware for live phone conversations and interviews, additional microphones, as well as promotional and marketing materials to get the word out. Anything raised beyond the goal will be put toward improving the web site’s functionality and to implement other features to improve the site as well as to pay the costs of regular maintenance.</p>
<p>I view the Monadnock Internet Radio project as a truly local community radio ‘station’ giving listeners a choice for news and information about what’s happening in the Monadnock Region and New Hampshire and presenting topics of local and regional concern and interest. This is the reason why I would like the project to be funded by the local community directly, to spotlight a sense of community and shared involvement in building an honestly local media source.</p>
<p>Monadnock Internet Radio will be <em>your</em> station ! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perks</p>
<p>Monadnock Internet Radio/MIRadiostation.com  will have a separate web page dedicated to sponsors to permanently thank those who help fund the launch of this project. You can have your name or business logo listed as a founding supporter. Other perks for different levels of contribution are listed on the right column of the “50 Day Challenge for Monadnock Internet Radio” page at indiegogo.com .</p>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What is the ""NanoHold"" Test""?</b><br/></p>
<p>Use the “NanoHold Test” to assess the suction contact with a slight pull
on the device, like checking a suction cup for suction. The device should adhere
tightly to and not come off of the surface. Do not let go of your device if it does not pass the “NanoHold Test” or if there is any doubt about whether there is sufficient suction to hold the device.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Test your application. Make sure the condition of the NanoHold, the surface chosen, and the suction contact are sufficient to
support the device for the amount of time you plan on NanoHold supporting the
device. NanoHolds stick temporarily, and like all suction devices, the duration

MEET NANOHOLD - NANOSUCTION FOR YOUR PHONE, CASE, AND TABLET
With NanoHold, it's easy to stick your mobile device to many smooth, flat surfaces. NanoHold provides a new dimension in hands-free mobile device usage.


                     





NanoHold is like having another person to hold your phone, allowing you to take better photos and use your mobile device in new and useful ways not possible before. With NanoHold, everyone can be in the picture.



Behind NanoHold's simple appearing exterior are decades of advanced materials design technology. While NanoHolds may look like simple pieces of plastic, they are powerful and can hold hundreds of times their own weight.




NanoHold material has microscopic suction ""cups"" on its surface. Because they use suction, NanoHolds stick without being sticky. NanoSuction does not leave a residue.



          
                 


      


Each NanoHold is engineered with 5 layers:





NanoHolds have two sides, the top side with nanosuction (blue in the diagram) and the bottom side with adhesion (red in the diagram). The bottom side of each NanoHold holds tightly to your device. NanoHolds are shipped with a protective liner on both sides that must be removed to use the product.

         


WHAT WILL NANOHOLDS STICK ON?
NanoHolds stick on many clean, flat, smooth, dry, non-porous surfaces including: 




WILL NANOHOLD WORK WITH MY DEVICE OR CASE?
NanoHolds work best on devices with flat backs or with flat cases.


CAN I TAKE THE NANOHOLD OFF MY DEVICE ONCE IT HAS BEEN INSTALLED?
Yes. NanoHolds are removable.


WHAT COLOR ARE NANOHOLDS?
NanoHolds come in black or white. You can have any color you like, as long as it is black or white.

                                                 


CAN NANOHOLDS BE USED WITH TABLETS?
Yes. Just use two or more NanoHolds depending on the size of your tablet.

                            


WILL NANOHOLDS WORK ON HORIZONTAL SURFACES TOO?
NanoHolds work like an anti-slip pad when laid flat, to help prevent your device from moving around or falling. By holding tightly to the surface, NanoHolds can also keep toddlers from moving your phone.



HOW DO I TAKE CARE OF MY NANOHOLD?
NanoHolds come with a cover to protect them and extend their life.
Clean and rejuvenate your NanoHold by wiping it with a damp cloth or paper towel and allowing it to dry. You can also use cellophane tape (like Scotch Tape) for a waterless method to clean the surface of NanoHolds.    
                            
                                          
CAN I USE MY OWN PROTECTIVE COVER WITH NANOHOLD?                                    
Yes. Choose your favorite object that is the size of a credit card. A laminated, plastic, or glossy object works best. Examples of covers can be ID cards, photos, business cards, etc. Use your imagination and make your NanoHold even more fun. Below is a photo of the double-sided protective cover provided with each NanoHold. One side is black, the other side is white.




CAN I USE NANOHOLDS TO PROMOTE MY BUSINESS OR ORGANIZATION?CAN YOU PRINT CUSTOM ARTWORK ON THE COVERS? Yes, for order amounts of 250 units or more, we can print custom four color images on the cover. You supply the print ready art. Great for promoting your business or organaization, school fundraising projects and swag giveaways at conventions. There is no better endorsement for your business than to have your image on the back of a customer's smartphone. For larger amounts, contact us at customercare@nanohold.com.
HOW LONG WILL NANOHOLDS LAST?

NanoHolds keep suction power over time when kept clean and undamaged. Cared for NanoHolds will last many months to years. By cleaning your NanoHold with a damp cloth or paper towel, you can repeatedly rejuvenate and indefinitely extend the life of your NanoHold. 

FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE. REALLY!!
Yes, really. Free shipping in the USA and Internationally. If you are outside the USA and contribute to perks of up to three NanoHolds, your order will be posted with Global Forever Stamps via United States Postal Service. 
PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS NO TRACKING WITH FREE SHIPPING.
The stamp looks pretty amazing too:

of suction cannot be predicted. Use NanoHolds responsibly and at your own
risk. Be smart and enjoy your NanoHolds safely.

PowerClip can also charge other devices with micro USB inputs such as Amazon Kindle or Sony Playstation Vita.<br/><br/><b>How do you charge PowerClip?</b><br/>PowerClip is charged by plugging the included mUSB lead into the back of the PowerClip. You can charge the USB lead into any device with a USB port such as a wall socket adapter or a laptop/desktop PC.</p><p><b>When will I get my PowerClip?<br/></b>We plan to get your PowerClip in your hands by Jan/Feb 2016.<br/></p><p><b>Is the keyring loop likely to break?</b><br/>The PowerClip is made of a string ABS plastic and is unlikely to shatter/break easily. The lobster clasp has full 360 degree rotation, meaning that the key ring loop will never experience enough torque to snap off or crack.<br/><br/><b>How long does the battery inside the PowerClip last in idle mode?</b><br/>Due to smart circuit design and high grade batteries and the fact that Bluetooth requires only nano amps to function correctly, we estimate the battery to last around two to three weeks uncharged.<br/><b><br/>How loud is the sounder inside the PowerClip?</b><br/>The sounder inside the PowerClip is small but it packs a punch- you will definitely be able to hear it from another room or two away. We will conduct accurate sound tests during the testing phase of production.</p><p><b>What files can you read/write via the Bluetooth connection?</b><br/>You can currently view photos with our prototype, however we hope to develop this into streaming video and multi-file type viewer during the app development phase.<br/><b><br/>Does the PowerClip connect with phones that have cases?</b><br/>The PowerClip is designed to work perfectly with uncased phones, however PowerClip will still connect to phones with very slim profile cases (&lt;1mm).</p><p><b>Why is your campaign is USD when you are based in UK?</b><br/>We will be manufacturing in an Apple MFi certified factory in China, therefore we will save costs by paying for the production of PowerClips in USD (the international currency). This allows us to deliver the stated price above, protecting our customers from any price fluctuations.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","PowerClip is a portable multifunction device that can assist you not only in emergency situations, but can help you avoid those stressful situations such as your phone battery dying while on the move or searching around frantically for your car keys.PowerClip is available in two form factors: the smaller more compact micro and the larger battery / memory capacity PRO.PowerClip micro contains a custom high-grade 500mAh lithium polymer battery which can give you an extra 20% charge on your smartphone-  essential in those emergency situations.

// REWARDSSINGLE PACKSDOUBLE PACKS// WHAT'S IN THE BOX?// WHY INDIEGOGO?Crowdfunding is the perfect way to both 
validate our product, by proving that there is a need for what we are 
offering, and to raise funding for our first mass production run. Indiegogo is the most open and creative crowdfunding platform out there and we believe the savvy Indiegogo Backers will see all of the hard work we have put in to PowerClip,
 and appreciate the design and technology as well as all of the great features.// RISKS AND CHALLENGESPROJECT MANAGEMENTThe hardest challenge by far will be to manage the project from the end of the campaign until the final product is fulfilled. The project lead will be our CEO and he will personally oversee the PowerClip production and fulfillment process.>ManufacturingMirai is an MFi (made for Apple) certified developer and we have access to all MFi certified factories. We also have a strong partner network in China, Hong Kong and Japan. Mirai will also involve the backers in key decisions throughout the manufacturing process.>CostWe believe that we have set a price level per unit that allows us to manufacture to the highest quality and we will select the manufacturer that best suits the PowerClip, so rest assured your product will be everything we say it will be.>DelaysWe aim to get PowerClips in your hand by the time set out above, but sometimes delays can be unavoidable. By planning our production in December, we will avoid the busy times coming up to Chinese New Year, which should help to expedite production. In the eventuality that there are any delays we will update you as soon as we can. We vow to keep an open communication channel at all times and will be posting regular updates on Twitter @miraipowerclip.> FulfilmentWe are confident that if we reach our goal we will be able to partner with a professional fulfillment company to make sure every backer gets their PowerClip in perfect condition and in a timely manner.// FAQWhat devices does PowerClip work on?The PowerClip is designed to work with your smartphone - either Apple iPhone 5 onwards, or any Android device that utilises the micro USB connection. PowerClip can also charge other devices with micro USB inputs such as Amazon Kindle or Sony Playstation Vita.How do you charge PowerClip?PowerClip is charged by plugging the included mUSB lead into the back of the PowerClip. You can charge the USB lead into any device with a USB port such as a wall socket adapter or a laptop/desktop PC.When will I get my PowerClip?We plan to get your PowerClip in your hands by Jan/Feb 2016.Is the keyring loop likely to break?The PowerClip is made of a string ABS plastic and is unlikely to shatter/break easily. The lobster clasp has full 360 degree rotation, meaning that the key ring loop will never experience enough torque to snap off or crack.How long does the battery inside the PowerClip last in idle mode?Due to smart circuit design and high grade batteries and the fact that Bluetooth requires only nano amps to function correctly, we estimate the battery to last around two to three weeks uncharged.How loud is the sounder inside the PowerClip?The sounder inside the PowerClip is small but it packs a punch- you will definitely be able to hear it from another room or two away. We will conduct accurate sound tests during the testing phase of production.What files can you read/write via the Bluetooth connection?You can currently view photos with our prototype, however we hope to develop this into streaming video and multi-file type viewer during the app development phase.Does the PowerClip connect with phones that have cases?The PowerClip is designed to work perfectly with uncased phones, however PowerClip will still connect to phones with very slim profile cases (<1mm).Why is your campaign is USD when you are based in UK?We will be manufacturing in an Apple MFi certified factory in China, therefore we will save costs by paying for the production of PowerClips in USD (the international currency). This allows us to deliver the stated price above, protecting our customers from any price fluctuations.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Skiva SmartQuad is back! Yes you guessed it right, we are back on Indiegogo after a successful run on Kickstarter but you must be thinking why?

Well due to overwhelming response and suggestions on Kickstarter, we decided to do a second run on Indiegogo for those who missed out on this amazing opportunity last time. That’s not all, this time we are offering SmartQuad with Bundle Packs and a huge reduction in International Shipping from $25 to $15.
When you have an offer such as this, why miss out on it!





























Why SmartQuad is best travel charger in World?


Compact, lightweight & easy to carry.
Charges up to 4 devices at fastest possible speed. (4 x2.4 Amps Ports)
Can charge virtually any smartphone, tablet, Bluetooth headset, GPS or any other USB based device irrespective of manufacturer.
Safe and quiet. (fan-less)
Built on solid experience of a highly successful Kickstarter project.(OctoFire)


Why we designed it?
With increasing personal & professional needs, now everyone needs multiple gadgets like smartphones, tablets or PC etc. We do purchase those gadgets to satisfy our needs but keeping all of them charged is a chore, especially during travel. Carrying multiple chargers is no fun and limited AC sockets can be annoying when multiple devices need to be charged.
There are many other chargers present in the market but they are not as smart. SmartQuad is unique because it can detect connected devices and output the optimal amount of current.







Earlier on Kickstarter we delivered a very successful 8-port charger product (OctoFire). OctoFire is a perfect solution for the desk, office, conference room, restaurants, charging stations etc., but in mobility it may not be the best. We listened to our OctoFire Kickstarter backers and designed SmartQuad based on their feedback. Below are the key differences from OctoFire:

AC/DC adapter & charger unit are merged into a single unit to make it travel friendly.
Ports have been reduced from 8 to 4 to make it more affordable, lightweight and compact.
Per port current has been increased from 2.1 Amps to 2.4 Amps.


We started out by experimenting with intelligent detection of devices to optimized charge current. We also designed AC to DC unit as efficient as possible taking advantage of latest power IC technology. This enabled us to make a design that does not need a fan to cool it even at peak loads.



We are in the final stages of production of our first batch of SmartQuad to fulfill the rewards of our Kickstarter SmartQuad backers.
Below shows the evolution of SmartQuad PCB design:

With our past experience of delivering OctoFire successfully and as we are near to shipping the first batch of SmartQuad, we are very confident to mass produce second batch of SmartQuad by November 2014. We have already confirmed with our supplier for the availability of components. Below is our timeline of production:

Pro-Active Personal Safety is our passion!  Every time we read about a disaster—whether natural or caused by man—we reflect upon what could have been done to either prevent or limit the human suffering that invariably followed. A similar passion resulted in the creation of the Baby Alert ChildMinder® System, a child safety system designed to prevent cases of children inadvertently being left alone in a vehicle.  Then, we quickly came to realize that adults, as well as children worldwide, suffer an equal vulnerability in this fast paced and often dangerous world. We believe that for every problem, there is an equal algorithmic solution. After three years of R&D and  field testing, we now present ECHO!

<p><b>Risks and chanllenges</b><br/><br/>Technical Challenge:</p>
<p>MOLT Team faced numerous challenges due to technical difficulty to make all desired functions into reality. Technologies involved in each function are complex and difficult to realize. However, we are pursuing to utilize all functions for Mstick with smart phone and make life simpler for end users.</p>
<p>We spent more time than we initially expected during the R&amp;D stage thus technical bugs are mostly eliminated and functions are ready for our backers.</p>
<p>MOLT Team is made up of specialists from different sectors with deep experience in developing and designing products. We love what we do and we are all very proud of our work.</p>
<p>Design: <br/>Mstick is created to keep the product user friendly. Therefore, Mstick fits in any interior settings and outdoor environment. The size of Mstick is optimal for all settings and usability and brightness of the LED light has been maximized.</p>
<p>Delivery: <br/>We expect to release the product by the end of April. The release date would be obeyed unless severe technical or logistical issue.</p>
<p>International Logistics: <br/>We are aware of issues of international delivery from other projects in Indiegogo. Our expert logistic staffs will proactively assist recipients to eliminate potential delays or missing products during transportation. Unfortunately, some countries impose duties, fees and taxes which will be recipients' responsibility.</p>

Risks and chanllengesTechnical Challenge:
MOLT Team faced numerous challenges due to technical difficulty to make all desired functions into reality. Technologies involved in each function are complex and difficult to realize. However, we are pursuing to utilize all functions for Mstick with smart phone and make life simpler for end users.
We spent more time than we initially expected during the R&D stage thus technical bugs are mostly eliminated and functions are ready for our backers.
MOLT Team is made up of specialists from different sectors with deep experience in developing and designing products. We love what we do and we are all very proud of our work.
Design: Mstick is created to keep the product user friendly. Therefore, Mstick fits in any interior settings and outdoor environment. The size of Mstick is optimal for all settings and usability and brightness of the LED light has been maximized.
Delivery: We expect to release the product by the end of April. The release date would be obeyed unless severe technical or logistical issue.
International Logistics: We are aware of issues of international delivery from other projects in Indiegogo. Our expert logistic staffs will proactively assist recipients to eliminate potential delays or missing products during transportation. Unfortunately, some countries impose duties, fees and taxes which will be recipients' responsibility.",38.0,2,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>How do we choose our OMBEE desk type (Laptop &amp;Monitor) Body color and panel color? </b></p>
<p>Go to this Google form <a href=""http://goo.gl/forms/xumu6qVP3l"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">--&gt; Click here &lt;--</a>  and fill out all the questions, before we ship out to your address we will do a final check on this info.</p>
<p><b>Why do we need to stand?</b></p>
<p>1. Keeps you healthy</p>
<p>If you stand 3 or 4 more hours 5 days a week, over the course of a year, it's equivalent to running 10 marathons</p>
<p>2. Relieves back pain</p>
<p>Up to 90% more pressure is applied on your lower back when sitting instead of standing. By simply breaking up sitting with standing throughout your day, you can drastically reduce lower back pain.</p>
<p>3. Boosts productivity</p>
<p>Research shows that standing may lead to a  10% increase in worker productivity. Standing with motion offers benefits such as higher energy levels, improved concentration, and fewer headaches.</p>
<br/><p><b>When will I get my OMBEE Desk?</b></p>
<p>We are aiming to make our first delivery's to Indiegogo Backers December 2016. Once all backers have thier OMBEE products we will begin sellling the desks on AMAZON Prime. </p>
<br/><p><b>What is your return policy?</b></p>
<p>If you find a factory defect out of the box ,we will replace the unit at no cost to you. Just send the product back in its original box with all pieces that were included.  If the unit shows signs of damage instead of factory defect, there may be a repair fee.</p>
<br/><p><b>How high will the OMBEE raise my workspace over a regular desk?</b></p>
<p>The OMBEE is designed to go on top of a regular 30-inch high office desk. The OMBEE set with 8 legs can raise your desk 6, 12, 15 and 18 inches off a regular desk.  You particular office desk may be slightly taller or shorter than 30 inches.</p>
<br/><p><b>Warranty</b></p>
<p>We built the OMBEE to be tough. If you do happen to unintentionally break the product, just email us here at info@ombeesystems.com. If you receive a defective product and it breaks because of the defect, we will replace it. If, however, you put the OMBEE in situations where the weight, temperature, or drop height (6 ft) is exceeded, we cannot replace the product.  However, you can purchase replacement parts from us. For more info call 818-748-7776, 9AM-5PM Pacific Standard Time 7 days a week.</p>
<br/><p><b>How much weight can the OMBEE Desk hold?</b></p>
<p>The laptop stand is designed to hold a 17-inch (or smaller) Apple, Dell, HP or LG laptop that has a slim profile. Large and thick 17-inch gamer laptops (Alienware) will not fit into the laptop stand and we would recommend getting the monitor version. The OMBEE Desk set for monitor stand is design to hold a 27-inch LCD/LED computer monitor. We recommend the total weight put on the OMBEE desk to not exceed 30 lbs.  However, we have tested the OMBEE system with much more weight.</p>
<p><b>I have a laptop but sometimes I may put a monitor on it , which OMBEE set should I choose? </b></p>
<p>If you think you may be putting a laptop and monitor on the OMBEE Desk from time to time then get the Monitor Version seen below.</p>
<p><b>Is the plastic used in the OMBEE Desk entirely BPA free? Is it safe to be around all day in an office with limited airflow? </b></p>
<p>Yes, the following information is from our production facility with over 25 years of experience with plastics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>""Polypropylene plastic. BPAs are usually found in polycarbonate plastics in the resin so there wouldn't be any in your product. BPAs used to be in a lot of blow molded bottles but now a days they have moved onto better plastics.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Polycarbonate is a good material and only affects the human if you heat cycle it and ingest it...</p>

<b>What are the measurements of the OMBEE Case?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>The case is 26x6x13 inches closed up.</div>
<div><b>How much working area will I have when it's set up on my desk? </b></div>
<div> Fully opened up with panels extended the working area of the desk is 44x26 inches which is 7.94 sq ft, (.737 sq m) of working space </div>
<div><b>If I get the monitor version of the OMBEE Desk how much space to I have on that top platform? </b></div>
<div>The monitor platform is 26x10x1 inches </div>
<br/><p><b>Can I get multiple perks?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes! You can back our campaign as many times as you want, choosing as many perks as you want.</p>
<br/><p><b>Can I change my perk?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, not during the campaign. But before we send you your desk, we'll send you an email with a link to a system that will help you manage your perk, input your shipping information, and purchase add-ons if you choose.</p>
<br/><p><b>Why is this better than and adjustable sit/stand workstation?</b></p>
<p>1. It's easier to transport. Try moving other sit/stand workstations for outside use on a sunny day or taking it on a road trip!</p>
<p>2. The OMBEE set provides lower body movement.  Others make you buy an additional piece of equipment, if available at all.</p>
<p>3. It's a case for your computer, mouse, and keyboard also.  Most laptops should fit into the case even with the regular complement of OMBEE components.</p>
<p>4. It does not encourage you to sit! We think a standing desk that easily lets you sit defeats the purpose of a standing desk. Once set up, the OMBEE does not switch to sitting mode easily because we just don't want you to sit! You sit enough already elsewhere.  If you really need to sit, pull up a stool or take a 5-minute sitting break.</p>
<p>5. You can put a padlock on it to secure the valuables inside.</p>
<p>6. It's got a cool hexagon design where you can click in our future accessories such as smartphone and tablet holders and our split keyboards.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why are you building the OMBEE system in the USA? </b></p>
<p><b>1. Quality control -</b> the founders will be on site for the initial production of the OMBEE Desks on a daily basis.</p>
<p><b>2. Cost -</b> Once you factor in flying to Asia ten times, cost of production delays, and shipping costs, making the product initially in California makes financial sense.</p>
<p><b>3. On-site machine shop - </b>for quick changes/repairs/improvements to the molds.</p>
<p><b>4. Proximity - </b>15 minutes from both founders' homes.</p>
<p><b>5. Track record -</b> We have working relationship for 10 years building other plastic  products with our injection molder.</p>

If you find a factory defect out of the box ,we will replace the unit at no cost to you. Just send the product back in its original box with all pieces that were included.  If the unit shows signs of damage instead of factory defect, there may be a repair fee.
How high will the OMBEE raise my workspace over a regular desk?
The OMBEE is designed to go on top of a regular 30-inch high office desk. The OMBEE set with 8 legs can raise your desk 6, 12, 15 and 18 inches off a regular desk.  You particular office desk may be slightly taller or shorter than 30 inches.
Warranty
We built the OMBEE to be tough. If you do happen to unintentionally break the product, just email us here at info@ombeesystems.com. If you receive a defective product and it breaks because of the defect, we will replace it. If, however, you put the OMBEE in situations where the weight, temperature, or drop height (6 ft) is exceeded, we cannot replace the product.  However, you can purchase replacement parts from us. For more info call 818-748-7776, 9AM-5PM Pacific Standard Time 7 days a week.
How much weight can the OMBEE Desk hold?
The laptop stand is designed to hold a 17-inch (or smaller) Apple, Dell, HP or LG laptop that has a slim profile. Large and thick 17-inch gamer laptops (Alienware) will not fit into the laptop stand and we would recommend getting the monitor version. The OMBEE Desk set for monitor stand is design to hold a 27-inch LCD/LED computer monitor. We recommend the total weight put on the OMBEE desk to not exceed 30 lbs.  However, we have tested the OMBEE system with much more weight.
I have a laptop but sometimes I may put a monitor on it , which OMBEE set should I choose? 
If you think you may be putting a laptop and monitor on the OMBEE Desk from time to time then get the Monitor Version seen below.
Is the plastic used in the OMBEE Desk entirely BPA free? Is it safe to be around all day in an office with limited airflow? 
Yes, the following information is from our production facility with over 25 years of experience with plastics.

""Polypropylene plastic. BPAs are usually found in polycarbonate plastics in the resin so there wouldn't be any in your product. BPAs used to be in a lot of blow molded bottles but now a days they have moved onto better plastics.


Polycarbonate is a good material and only affects the human if you heat cycle it and ingest it...


http://www.livestrong.com/article/158674-which-plastic-containers-can-i-safely-use/


Check out the read above. Notice #5 is safe!""




If you only have a laptop and want to get the best ergonomic position then get the Laptop version shown below. It will hold your laptop at near eye level. 




What are the measurements of the OMBEE Case?

The case is 26x6x13 inches closed up.
How much working area will I have when it's set up on my desk? 
 Fully opened up with panels extended the working area of the desk is 44x26 inches which is 7.94 sq ft, (.737 sq m) of working space 
If I get the monitor version of the OMBEE Desk how much space to I have on that top platform? 
The monitor platform is 26x10x1 inches 
Can I get multiple perks?
Yes! You can back our campaign as many times as you want, choosing as many perks as you want.
Can I change my perk?
Unfortunately, not during the campaign. But before we send you your desk, we'll send you an email with a link to a system that will help you manage your perk, input your shipping information, and purchase add-ons if you choose.
Why is this better than and adjustable sit/stand workstation?
1. It's easier to transport. Try moving other sit/stand workstations for outside use on a sunny day or taking it on a road trip!
2. The OMBEE set provides lower body movement.  Others make you buy an additional piece of equipment, if available at all.
3. It's a case for your computer, mouse, and keyboard also.  Most laptops should fit into the case even with the regular complement of OMBEE components.
4. It does not encourage you to sit! We think a standing desk that easily lets you sit defeats the purpose of a standing desk. Once set up, the OMBEE does not switch to sitting mode easily because we just don't want you to sit! You sit enough already elsewhere.  If you really need to sit, pull up a stool or take a 5-minute sitting break.
5. You can put a padlock on it to secure the valuables inside.
6. It's got a cool hexagon design where you can click in our future accessories such as smartphone and tablet holders and our split keyboards.

Why are you building the OMBEE system in the USA? 
1. Quality control - the founders will be on site for the initial production of the OMBEE Desks on a daily basis.
2. Cost - Once you factor in flying to Asia ten times, cost of production delays, and shipping costs, making the product initially in California makes financial sense.
3. On-site machine shop - for quick changes/repairs/improvements to the molds.
4. Proximity - 15 minutes from both founders' homes.
5. Track record - We have working relationship for 10 years building other plastic  products with our injection molder.",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

About the App
Timedancer is a new interactive experience which marries
great episodic television with the thrill of “point and click” gaming and
puzzle solving. Imagine the television show Lost with games and multiple
scenarios which offer alternate endings, and you have Timedancer. 
Set in the near future, Timedancer chronicles the lives of
Tempus, Vivien, Ben, Kazuo and Adam, each of whom have their own agendas, but
whose fates are intertwined across the fabric of time and space by the
mysterious Timedancer Corporation. 
Vivien is a time traveler employed by the Timedancer
Corporation, which is headed up by the illusive Tempus. Under the guise of
using time travel for philanthropic reasons, Tempus is acquiring information to
eventually monetize and politicize time travel technology for his own profit
and means. With the help of a woman named Kazuo and the Alpha Timedancer named
Adam, Vivien has gone rogue, hoping to finally discover the truth about Tempus
and the Timedancer Corporation and eventually to take it down. 
The first episode of Timedancer was released late in 2010
and was featured as one of Microsoft's Recommended Apps on January 5, 2011. It
is currently available for download on Windows Phone 7. We are also working towards having Timedancer available on a range of platforms (Windows 8 tablets, PC, Mac and Xbox) later this
year.
 
What We Need 
We’re
looking to raise a total of $20,000 for post-production costs on episode 3 as
well as covering the costs for episode 4. The cost of producing each episode are roughly $9,000 to
produce which include the following: 


       
Salaries
for cast and crew and post-production staff time.


        Renting
video equipment.


        Renting
locations throughout London.


        Catering.

The remainder of the funds will be used for the following:

        IndieGoGo
fees (4% for each product that is fully funded; 9% for projects that are not
fully funded by the deadline).


      
Printing
promotional materials and costs of shipping items to backers of our IndieGoGo
campaign.

   Costs associated with renting a space and catering for the cast and crew party in London and the private screenings in London, NYC and Kuala Lumpur.
Starting work on porting to Windows 8 tablets, PC, Mac and Xbox 360.
What
happens if we aren’t fully funded by the deadline? We will port Episode 1 & 2 to PC & Mac by the end of the year, and all backers who pledged more than $50 will
receive the gifts listed under the $50 backer level.

We then partnered up with mobile broadband providers. Out of the codes and data, Shark Sim was born! This small sim card allows you to have unlimited broadband in Europe for selected periods of time. Great news to the worldwide travelers coming into Europe!

</div></div>","Why TinyJuice? 
Currently, there are a lot of cable chargers but they are extremely inconvenient. There are only a few portable wireless chargers, but they are actually not as convenient as they seem because they can't stick to your phone, hindering their charging capabilities.
But, TinyJuice is a revolutionary product that fixes all of these problems!
 

 
It is a pocket-sized wireless charging power bank; its NANO-Suction surface will stick to the back of the phone, so you don’t need to worry about losing the connection between the phone and the charger. It also functions as a phone stand and a finger ring for added convenience. What’s more, it has a sleek design and comes in at an affordable price! 
 


 




 



 
TinyJuice supports fast wireless QI charging. Developed by the Wireless Power Consortium, QI is the industry standard, which defines wireless power transfer using inductive charging over distances of up to 1.6 inches.
If your device supports wireless charging, it works with Qi. That is, TinyJuice works with any device which supports wireless charging! For example, the following models are QI-enabled:
Apple iPhone: 8, 8 Plus, X, XR, XS, XS MAX
Samsung Galaxy: Note 9, S9, S9+, Note 8, S8, S8+, S7, S7 Edge (Plus more devices)
Google Nexus: 4, 5, 6, 7 (2013) Pixel series
Sony: Xperia XZ3, Xperia XZ2 Premium, Xperia XZ2 (Plus more devices)
and more...
 

 



 
TinyJuice’s battery has a high conversion rate and a high power 5v output, which means it can charge your device fast and safely.
 

 


Most iPhone models have around 2900mAh of internal battery capacity. TinyJuice has a 3000mAh battery, which means TinyJuice can double your battery life with a single charge, anytime anywhere.
Also, TinyJuice is small and compact, but using innovative battery technology, it fits a full-sized 3000mAh battery into the casing.

 

 



 
The surface of the TinyJuice is embedded with NANO-Suction technology. With this technology, your phone will easily and securely stick to the surface. This means that while charging, you won’t have to worry about the connection between TinyJuice and the phone coming loose and losing your charge. Also, as long as you stick TinyJuice to the back of your phone, charging starts immediately.
 
 


 
Even though the surface is super sticky, you can still remove TinyJuice from your phone quickly and easily without leaving behind any residue.
 

 

 
TinyJuice weighs only 105g, which is less than half the weight of the iPhone XS Max and 60% the weight of the iPhone XS. TinyJuice measures 2.5 inch width and 3 inch height, which is smaller than the width of iPhone XS, making this one of the lightest and smallest wireless chargers on the market.
 

 
 


 
Even with a case on your phone, you’ll still be able to receive the full power of TinyJuice’s charging abilities. The device sticks to cases and functions just as flawlessly.

 

 
TinyJuice is the first wireless power bank with an included 180° finger ring stand. The ring functions as a phone stand and also a convenient and secure way to hold your phone, and the 180° rotation allows you to adjust the angle to your preference. 
 
 


 
Using TinyJuice, you can stand your phone on a table while watching a movie, and at the same time charge your phone.
 
 


 
The phone ring also keeps your phone safe on-the-go, with your finger in the ring, you will never drop your phone again. No other charger features this built-in function, and phone rings alone cost about $8 on Amazon, and we include it plus the other features for only CA$25 (KS Early Bird). 
 

 

 
TinyJuice is available in two colors: black and white.
 

 
Throughout the funding process, we kept receiving suggestions from our backers regarding adding a protection case to the charger. Now, everyone will get an FREE additional protection case!

<p>Many customers have Smartphones with no Bluetooth LE and so cannot sync with the latest devices being developed.  Many perfectly good devices do not have wireless capability and only connect to PCs (Windows or iOS) by USB.

<p>For us, CE marking as a medical device is ultra expensive and adding BLE means recertification.  POGO solves this problem.  It acts as a USB host and a Bluetooth LE communication device.</p>
<p>So we thought, wouldn't it be great if we found a way to let other App developers connect devices to their Apps using POGO.  But we need a Software Development Kit to make this possible and we are seeking support to develop this project and we need £5,000 to develop and test this software which we will make open source thereafter.</p>

Lightning Saver comes in eight colors and perfectly encloses your Lightning cable, so you don’t have to buy a new one.

</b></p>
<p>How often do you leave a business party, networking event or

or <b>tell your personal story</b>?  For the first time, your phone can help you
network successfully with new contacts.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our new Loopd app uses a <b>peer-to-peer Bluetooth technology </b>that
allows your <b>smartphone to connect with people </b>within hyper-proximity of
you – and not on the other side of town.  We are Bluetooth advocates who <b>believe recent advances</b>, such as <b>less demand on batteries</b> and ability to
<b>run in the background</b> on your
smartphone, make it the friendliest short-range wireless technology on Earth. </p>
<p>As result, you can knowingly, securely, and quickly build mutually
<b>meaningful relationships</b> and <b>quality
networks</b> in a crowded room. Social discovery can happen automatically with
your device tucked away in your pocket. To help you put each new acquaintance into
context, the Loopd app identifies the location, time, and date of <b>every
interaction</b>. Loopd also takes care of the little details like exchanging
telephone numbers, email addresses and Linkedin profiles (if you wish) so you
can spend more time having <b>really genuine conversations</b>.</p>
<p>Our Motto: </p>

“Live in the moment. Let
Loopd do the work for you!”<p></p>

<p>The emergence of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and the prevalence of smartphones encouraged us to reinvent this common human experience and make it even more simplistic. </p>
<p>Within the first five minutes of the project, our team talked about how frustrating everyone felt it was to exchange business cards and otherwise collect professional contact information with context at networking events.  We also agreed it was tough to build relationships with important people, and even tougher to sustain a high quality network over time. So we decided to <b>focus first on releasing an app focused on business events </b>that could change the way people approach professional networking. </p>

</div></div>","Our StoryWe started off with a simple social discovery app called “Loopd”.
The app enables attendees at business events to connect and build strong
professional networks.Our story is about empowering people – you and me by enhancing devices already in our lives (smartphones).
IMPROVE Social Discovery





How often do you leave a business party, networking event or
meeting feeling like you missed opportunities to exchange contact information
or tell your personal story?  For the first time, your phone can help you
network successfully with new contacts.







Our new Loopd app uses a peer-to-peer Bluetooth technology that
allows your smartphone to connect with people within hyper-proximity of
you – and not on the other side of town.  We are Bluetooth advocates who believe recent advances, such as less demand on batteries and ability to
run in the background on your
smartphone, make it the friendliest short-range wireless technology on Earth. 
As result, you can knowingly, securely, and quickly build mutually
meaningful relationships and quality
networks in a crowded room. Social discovery can happen automatically with
your device tucked away in your pocket. To help you put each new acquaintance into
context, the Loopd app identifies the location, time, and date of every
interaction. Loopd also takes care of the little details like exchanging
telephone numbers, email addresses and Linkedin profiles (if you wish) so you
can spend more time having really genuine conversations.
Our Motto: 

“Live in the moment. Let
Loopd do the work for you!”



Features at a Glance



Loopd improves your networking at business events by:
Identifying the location, time, and date of every
interaction
Instantly searching and connecting with people within 10 to
15 feet of you
Running with full functionality even if your smartphone
is in your pocket
Adapting to your behavior so that you don’t have to learn
any new habits
Messaging, note taking, curating lists, and exporting
capabilities 
Giving you the option of customizing appearance with
color schemes, compelling visuals, social content, and more

Redefining the way you
use your smartphone






Now We are Thinking Big!


Resulting from our
success with this first
Bluetooth-inspired social discovery app, we want to expand our technology and
experience to optimize social discovery and relationship nurturing in other social events - not just business professional.

Potential Use Cases


Music Festivals

Your smartphone replaces your keys forever.</p><p>At the press of a button, Noke wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone. If the phone is within a few feet, Noke instantly unlocks so you can be on your way. No need to re-launch the app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse. It even works when your phone is asleep.</p><p>If you'd like to add an extra layer of security, you can disable the auto-unlock feature and require the press of a button in the app to open Noke.</p><h1>Compatible with Apple Watch and Other Smart Watches</h1><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/421/041/4c83d70a29ebb4e31f8f1996ad90e380_original.jpg?v=1426077918&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=60bbdaa9d61fdbae3d07fcc951864d9a"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>The Noke app gives you the option to turn off auto-unlock.

So, we added an alarm to the Noke U-Lock. Just like the alarm on your car, you arm it when you want it and it automatically disarms each time you open it with the app or the quick-click code.</p><p>When a would-be intruder shakes your Noke for more than 3 seconds, a shrieking alarm goes off. This will definitely send him running and get the attention of anyone within about 50 meters.

Your support made Noke a huge success and caused the tech world to take notice. Noke went on to win the CES Design and Engineering Award and Engadget's Insert Coin people's choice award. So we thought it was time to bring you the next member of the Noke family. The Noke U-Lock incorporates all the awesome features that make the padlock so amazing and encases them inside a virtually indestructible steel alloy housing. In case that wasn't enough, we added an integrated alarm that will send would-be intruders running for cover.Strong, water resistant, attractive, included bike mount, the Noke U-Lock has it all.How It WorksUsing your phone's Bluetooth Smart connection and the Noke app (iOS, Android, or Windows Phone) you can effortlessly open your Noke U-Lock with the push of a button. Your smartphone replaces your keys forever.At the press of a button, Noke wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone. If the phone is within a few feet, Noke instantly unlocks so you can be on your way. No need to re-launch the app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse. It even works when your phone is asleep.If you'd like to add an extra layer of security, you can disable the auto-unlock feature and require the press of a button in the app to open Noke.Compatible with Apple Watch and Other Smart WatchesThe Noke app gives you the option to turn off auto-unlock. By deactivating auto-unlock, you need to press the unlock button on the app to open Noke. If you’d rather not pull your phone out of your pocket, you can unlock Noke with your Apple Watch.We are also planning to make the app compatible with other smart watches (Pebble and Android watches) as their Bluetooth protocols are finalized.AlarmWe made the Noke U-Lock exceptionally strong, but we think an extra layer of protection can give you some peace of mind. So, we added an alarm to the Noke U-Lock. Just like the alarm on your car, you arm it when you want it and it automatically disarms each time you open it with the app or the quick-click code.When a would-be intruder shakes your Noke for more than 3 seconds, a shrieking alarm goes off. This will definitely send him running and get the attention of anyone within about 50 meters. Yes, it's that loud.In addition, if an intruder attempts to enter the quick-click code more than 3 times, the alarm will sound to send them away.*Setting the alarm activates an internal accelerometer to detect motion. The accelerometer will reduce battery life but you will still get several months (5-6 months) of constant use with the alarm enabled. When the battery gets down to 20% you will receive a notification in the app.SharingWe know you love to share your bike. The Noke app makes it safe and easy.

<h2>
<i>Why</i> We Developed antsle</h2>
<div>
<p>What made the Internet great in the first place was freedom. Suddenly, everyone could participate in something that worked on a global scale. That fact was responsible for the Internet's unbelievable growth we've witnessed over the course of the past few decades.</p>
<p>We feel that this freedom got lost. Yes, everybody can still participate, but under the rules that are imposed on us by just a few. We're mutating more and more into targets for unwanted advertising or - frankly - spam. We're being intentionally blocked from using cool stuff that's technically possible - only to serve the commercial interests of those who dominate the Internet. On too many occasions, we're being spied on.</p>

</li></ul>It's time for transformation. We at antsle set out to make web hosting from home, on your own server, as easy as 1-2-3. Plus, it saves you a ton of money compared to cloud hosting and cloud services.<p> </p>
<p>Also, we've made our solution powerful, beautiful, and 100% silent. And we're doing all that for a reason. If it's not easy, you simply won't use it. If it's noisy, you won't use it in your home. If it looks crappy, you won't proudly show it off to your friends and family.</p>

<p>There are about 700 million websites today, hosted on about 80 million servers. However only 50 companies control 80% of them! That's 0.000007% of the total number of websites. The internet's control structures are broken.</p>With antsle, you finally have the means to control your data, your code and the access to it. And that's how it should be. We want you to be a part of the Home Hosting movement and shift power back to where it belongs:</div>

<p>The antsle™ home server is a beautiful and powerful device, enclosed in an aluminum case that acts as the heatsink. There are no fans, no vent holes and no movable parts. It’s 100% silent (0.0 dB) so perfectly suited for the living room!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can run hundreds of virtual servers on your antsle at the same time and it holds all your data. <b>You</b> decide <i>if</i> and <i>when</i> any data leaves your home. So you’re in total control of your personal information that has become so valuable to Google, Amazon and others.</p>
<p>An antsle is not just the piece of hardware in a beautiful case. Instead, it's a turn-key solution for web hosting from home, consisting of three components:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>The antsle™ home server, a beautiful and powerful device with an aluminum case. The antsle has no fans, no vent holes and no movable parts. It’s absolutely silent (0dB).</li>
<li>antsleOS™ enables more than 100 virtual servers to run on a single antsle.</li>
<li>The absolute highlight is antman™, our management software for VMs / virtual servers. Get your virtual servers up and running in one minute. Install server-side apps with our one-click installers.</li>
</ol>It's important to us that under no circumstances you will lose any data. That's why we're using ZFS, the world's most fault-tolerant file system. ZFS has been designed by Sun Microsystems with an important design: never allow any event to create an inconsistent state on the disk.<p>We have at least <b>two</b> SSDs in every antsle. If one of them fails, you still have your data on the other one. And you might ask: What if my RAM has a bit error? These things happen, and they matter. RAM bit errors can get written to disk and ruin your data. That's why we built error-correcting (ECC) RAM into each an every antsle.</p>
<p>Best of all: You don't need to worry about these things. We've built ZFS, mirroring and ECC into our antsleOS. It will be automatically there, in each and every virtual server that you create on your antsle, without you having to care about it in any way. Given our role as the pioneer of home hosting, we thought that's what we owe you.</p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449731578/g29cgqnfkjmkyfbyytnv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div>The antsle is extremely energy efficient. Even at full load of all eight CPU core around the clock, every day, it'll add a mere $2 to your monthly electricity bill. That number is based on a US average of $0.10 / kWh.</div> <h2>The Software</h2>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>antsle comes with several layers of software.</p>
<p>First, there is <b>antsleOS</b>. That's our ""hypervisor"". It's the underlying technology that ""slices"" your antsle into several, ""virtual"" servers. So you buy one antsle, and you can then use it to run hundreds of virtual servers, each of which would cost you $20 or so per month with Amazon EC2. We call each of our virtual servers an antlet. Each antlet can either be based on LXC container virtualization for extreme performance, or it can be based KVM hardware-level virtualization in case you want to run an OS other than Linux in your antlet. In a single antsle, you can run Windows in one antlet, SmartOS in another antlet, FreeBSD in a third and a different version of Windows in a fourth antlet.</p>
<p>Then, on top of antsleOS, we have <b>antman</b>™. The word stands for ""antlet manager"", and it does pretty much what it says: it enables you create and manage your antlets in a super-easy way. If you're familiar with digitalocean: antman works in a very similar way. What do you do with your antlets? If you know how to do it, you can <i>ssh</i> into your antlet and install whatever server-side software you want.</p>
<p>And here's the highlight: Even if you're not familiar with managing a server with ssh and the command line, you can still use your antsle for fascinating things by using our <b>one-click installers</b>.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of antman:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449693759/hge5wdntf9xjdtlwmppu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div>There are no limits on what you can install in each of your antlets. Examples include:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Host your own home-based email server. That's right, just as Hillary did! ;-)</li>
<li>Manage your contacts and calendars. From your home, rather than with iCloud or google. Access (and change) your antsle-based contacts and appointments from your iPhone, Android, iPad, ...</li>
<li>Have your own ""drive"" to share files just like Dropbox, but with full data ownership in your home.</li>
<li>Run a basecamp-like team collaboration tool from your home.</li>
<li>Run a CRM system.</li>
<li>Run your own URL shortener, just like bit.ly or t.co, but under YOUR control, and with much shorter URL because you're not sharing URLs with millions of people.</li>
<li>Run gitlab and host 10,000 or so git repositories which would cost you a fortune with github.</li>
<li>Much, much more.</li>
</ul></div>
<div>Just one app, that you can easily install in one of your antlets with our one-click installer, is OX App Suite. That apps lets you handle your email, contacts, calendar and Drive on your antsle. It's a piece of freedom - everything's under your own control. We've included a few screenshots of OX App Suite, which is open source software by Open Xchange:</div> <p><b>Email</b></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Slash Your Cost by 90%</span></h3>
<div> </div>
<p>Most fees for hosting, cloud services etc. are paid on a monthly basis. They sound low. Compare that to antsle: The only thing you pay for is the hardware. You can easily use it for two or even four years.</p>
<p>Over that period, the monthly fees you used to pay before you owned the antsle are really adding up.</p>
<p>We’ve prepared some sample calculations to illustrate that effect.</p>
<p>Of course, every person is different. We’ve created two fictitious individuals, Harry and Sally. Harry is someone that works in a technology environment, and uses hosting services for side projects or on a semi-professional basis. He can’t afford to lose files when someone who he shares a Dropbox folder with accidentally deletes something. So he uses DropBox Pro and Dropbox extended history for himself and someone he works with on a regular basis, such as a VPA or his spouse. He pays github to host a few (private) repositories.</p>
<p>See how the cost breaks down in this table:</p>
<div> </div>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With antsle, in contrast, he pays only for the antsle itself. Everything else is either included or available for a free open-source download. So his new cost structure looks simple:</span></p>

<div> </div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Where we are today:</span></h3>
</div><div>
<div>antsle is already functional today. We have developed, tried and tested our hardware to ensure bare-metal performance with zero noise. The software prototype is also working smoothly but our vision is much bigger than what we are able to accomplish alone. That <span style=""background-color: initial;"">is exactly what the proceeds of our IndieGoGo campaign will be for:</span>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Your contributions will directly go towards the development of the software that makes the platform great</li>
<li>With your antsle purchase through our campaign, you will receive your very own antsle with free life-time software updates</li>
<li>AND you are directly contributing to the product you will be using for years to come</li>
</ul>
<div>We need the $15,000 funding goal in order to purchase the minimum order volume of the antsle aluminum cases from our supplier.</div>
<div>This will be an open campaign so your contributions will directly feed into further development of the platform, no matter how much we raise. We have already seen considerable interest from outside investors but part of what we are trying to create is an independent platform with only YOU in control. We've been working on antsle since August 2015 full-time and will continue to do so.</div>

<ul>
<li>antman, including a set of six one-click installers, is in a ""working prototype"" stage. Until delivery of the antsle, we will finish development of antman. This imposes the standard software development risks.</li>
<li>antsle relies on a core team of three. Should one of them cease to work on the team, it can have negative impacts on antsle's time line.</li>

You can track your referrals via your IndieGoGo account. Once the campaign has ended, we will be in touch!
 
Update: All perks now shipping February 25, 2016. That's two months earlier than the original plan!
Today, only 5 companies collect 70% of all online revenue. Worse still, only 50 companies control about 80% of the servers that together make up the Internet. Without antsle, we have no choice but to confide our personal information and code to Google, Amazon etc. and expose ourselves to a continually centralized Internet.
antsle's mission is to change that! To give back freedom, independence and 100% data ownership to you. To make it easy for everyone to run and control a server, an important piece of the Internet.

 


antsle is the first user-friendly turn-key solution to host apps & data at home:


The antsle™ home server, a beautiful and powerful device with an aluminum case. The antsle has no fans, no vent holes and no movable parts. It’s SSD-based, absolutely silent (0dB), secure and super energy-efficient. Up to 8 TB raw storage capacity (internal).
antsleOS™ enables more than 100 virtual servers to run on a single antsle.
The absolute highlight is antman™, our management software for VMs / virtual servers. Get your virtual servers up and running in one minute. Install server-side apps with our one-click installers.
antsle is just like the cloud, but with an important difference: Only you decide if and when your data leaves your home!

Why We Developed antsle

What made the Internet great in the first place was freedom. Suddenly, everyone could participate in something that worked on a global scale. That fact was responsible for the Internet's unbelievable growth we've witnessed over the course of the past few decades.
We feel that this freedom got lost. Yes, everybody can still participate, but under the rules that are imposed on us by just a few. We're mutating more and more into targets for unwanted advertising or - frankly - spam. We're being intentionally blocked from using cool stuff that's technically possible - only to serve the commercial interests of those who dominate the Internet. On too many occasions, we're being spied on.
 
 

If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer. You're the product being sold.  -- Andrew Lewis
It's time for transformation. We at antsle set out to make web hosting from home, on your own server, as easy as 1-2-3. Plus, it saves you a ton of money compared to cloud hosting and cloud services. 
Also, we've made our solution powerful, beautiful, and 100% silent. And we're doing all that for a reason. If it's not easy, you simply won't use it. If it's noisy, you won't use it in your home. If it looks crappy, you won't proudly show it off to your friends and family.
Learn some more about our motivations to start antsle in this video:

 
There are about 700 million websites today, hosted on about 80 million servers. However only 50 companies control 80% of them! That's 0.000007% of the total number of websites. The internet's control structures are broken.With antsle, you finally have the means to control your data, your code and the access to it. And that's how it should be. We want you to be a part of the Home Hosting movement and shift power back to where it belongs:
To you.

How We Do It - Our Design Goals 
Given our motivation, our cause and raison d'être, it was easy to come up with our design goals:
 

Make antsle a turn-key solution. If you need to find the right the right components yourself and make it all work together, we won't make an impact to the Internet and the world.
Make it dead-simple and easy to create virtual servers and install apps in them.
0dB noise. Period.
Super energy-efficient.
Security from the ground up.
Enough power to host hundreds of virtual servers in one antsle.
Appealing, beautiful case.
Fault-tolerance: never lose your data, not even through power fails.

 
 Steve Jobs once famously re-quoted Alan Kay: 
""People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware"" The Product

 antsle one & antsle one Pro
 


 
The antsle™ home server is a beautiful and powerful device, enclosed in an aluminum case that acts as the heatsink. There are no fans, no vent holes and no movable parts. It’s 100% silent (0.0 dB) so perfectly suited for the living room!
 
You can run hundreds of virtual servers on your antsle at the same time and it holds all your data. You decide if and when any data leaves your home. So you’re in total control of your personal information that has become so valuable to Google, Amazon and others.
An antsle is not just the piece of hardware in a beautiful case. Instead, it's a turn-key solution for web hosting from home, consisting of three components:
 

The antsle™ home server, a beautiful and powerful device with an aluminum case. The antsle has no fans, no vent holes and no movable parts. It’s absolutely silent (0dB).
antsleOS™ enables more than 100 virtual servers to run on a single antsle.
The absolute highlight is antman™, our management software for VMs / virtual servers. Get your virtual servers up and running in one minute. Install server-side apps with our one-click installers.
It's important to us that under no circumstances you will lose any data. That's why we're using ZFS, the world's most fault-tolerant file system. ZFS has been designed by Sun Microsystems with an important design: never allow any event to create an inconsistent state on the disk.We have at least two SSDs in every antsle. If one of them fails, you still have your data on the other one. And you might ask: What if my RAM has a bit error? These things happen, and they matter. RAM bit errors can get written to disk and ruin your data. That's why we built error-correcting (ECC) RAM into each an every antsle.
Best of all: You don't need to worry about these things. We've built ZFS, mirroring and ECC into our antsleOS. It will be automatically there, in each and every virtual server that you create on your antsle, without you having to care about it in any way. Given our role as the pioneer of home hosting, we thought that's what we owe you.
Here are the details:
 
 
 
 

The antsle is extremely energy efficient. Even at full load of all eight CPU core around the clock, every day, it'll add a mere $2 to your monthly electricity bill. That number is based on a US average of $0.10 / kWh. The Software
 


antsle comes with several layers of software.
First, there is antsleOS. That's our ""hypervisor"". It's the underlying technology that ""slices"" your antsle into several, ""virtual"" servers. So you buy one antsle, and you can then use it to run hundreds of virtual servers, each of which would cost you $20 or so per month with Amazon EC2. We call each of our virtual servers an antlet. Each antlet can either be based on LXC container virtualization for extreme performance, or it can be based KVM hardware-level virtualization in case you want to run an OS other than Linux in your antlet. In a single antsle, you can run Windows in one antlet, SmartOS in another antlet, FreeBSD in a third and a different version of Windows in a fourth antlet.
Then, on top of antsleOS, we have antman™. The word stands for ""antlet manager"", and it does pretty much what it says: it enables you create and manage your antlets in a super-easy way. If you're familiar with digitalocean: antman works in a very similar way. What do you do with your antlets? If you know how to do it, you can ssh into your antlet and install whatever server-side software you want.
And here's the highlight: Even if you're not familiar with managing a server with ssh and the command line, you can still use your antsle for fascinating things by using our one-click installers.
Here's a screenshot of antman:
 

There are no limits on what you can install in each of your antlets. Examples include:

Host your own home-based email server. That's right, just as Hillary did! ;-)
Manage your contacts and calendars. From your home, rather than with iCloud or google. Access (and change) your antsle-based contacts and appointments from your iPhone, Android, iPad, ...
Have your own ""drive"" to share files just like Dropbox, but with full data ownership in your home.
Run a basecamp-like team collaboration tool from your home.
Run a CRM system.
Run your own URL shortener, just like bit.ly or t.co, but under YOUR control, and with much shorter URL because you're not sharing URLs with millions of people.
Run gitlab and host 10,000 or so git repositories which would cost you a fortune with github.
Much, much more.

Just one app, that you can easily install in one of your antlets with our one-click installer, is OX App Suite. That apps lets you handle your email, contacts, calendar and Drive on your antsle. It's a piece of freedom - everything's under your own control. We've included a few screenshots of OX App Suite, which is open source software by Open Xchange: Email
 
 
 Contacts
 
 Calendar
 
 Drive
 
  
Slash Your Cost by 90%
 
Most fees for hosting, cloud services etc. are paid on a monthly basis. They sound low. Compare that to antsle: The only thing you pay for is the hardware. You can easily use it for two or even four years.
Over that period, the monthly fees you used to pay before you owned the antsle are really adding up.
We’ve prepared some sample calculations to illustrate that effect.
Of course, every person is different. We’ve created two fictitious individuals, Harry and Sally. Harry is someone that works in a technology environment, and uses hosting services for side projects or on a semi-professional basis. He can’t afford to lose files when someone who he shares a Dropbox folder with accidentally deletes something. So he uses DropBox Pro and Dropbox extended history for himself and someone he works with on a regular basis, such as a VPA or his spouse. He pays github to host a few (private) repositories.
See how the cost breaks down in this table:
 


 
With antsle, in contrast, he pays only for the antsle itself. Everything else is either included or available for a free open-source download. So his new cost structure looks simple:



 
 
Here’s the before/after comparison:

 
 
Quite impressive, huh?
Our next fictitious user is Sally. She is a freelance developer, and collaborates with three other people on a regular basis . She has several clients. See her cost breakdown here:

 
 
And again, the new cost structure with an antsle. In contrast to Harry, Sally is using and antsle Pro, as well as a RAM Upgrade and an HDD add-on.

 
 
Here’s the before/after comparison for Sally:


So with antsle, you’re not only reclaiming 100% data ownership, freedom and autonomy. You’re not only getting a beautiful and 100% silent device. You’re also saving an enormous amount of money!
 
Where we are today:

antsle is already functional today. We have developed, tried and tested our hardware to ensure bare-metal performance with zero noise. The software prototype is also working smoothly but our vision is much bigger than what we are able to accomplish alone. That is exactly what the proceeds of our IndieGoGo campaign will be for:


Your contributions will directly go towards the development of the software that makes the platform great
With your antsle purchase through our campaign, you will receive your very own antsle with free life-time software updates
AND you are directly contributing to the product you will be using for years to come

We need the $15,000 funding goal in order to purchase the minimum order volume of the antsle aluminum cases from our supplier.
This will be an open campaign so your contributions will directly feed into further development of the platform, no matter how much we raise. We have already seen considerable interest from outside investors but part of what we are trying to create is an independent platform with only YOU in control. We've been working on antsle since August 2015 full-time and will continue to do so.
 
Risks & Challenges

 

antman, including a set of six one-click installers, is in a ""working prototype"" stage. Until delivery of the antsle, we will finish development of antman. This imposes the standard software development risks.
antsle relies on a core team of three. Should one of them cease to work on the team, it can have negative impacts on antsle's time line.

</div></div>","We believe that enclosing full-fledged gaming PC inside the form factor of console is the future of gaming, so we spent over two years iterating and perfecting designs through multiple prototypes, to finally bring Sentry to life. Sentry is the world's first truly console-sized gaming PC chassis. It houses powerful components within a volume below 7 litres, which over the decades has been considered the optimal size for all media appliances residing in front of a TV (gaming consoles, satellite receivers, audio equipment)

  Design of Sentry started within the group of enthusiasts gathered at HardForum's Small Form Factor Systems section.Project's scope was defined, revised and refined thanks to those enthusiasts who spent their time discussing concepts and designs over the project's life.Sentry would not become what it is today without their contributions to the project from its early days.
 To create the smallest possible case supporting powerful components the standard frame-based approach to PC chassis building had to be abandoned. A number of creative ideas were required to make Sentry what it is today.
 

Straight-in GPU installation 
 



 


 Sentry's design lets user put the graphics card directly into the PCI-E slot and does not waste any space for graphics card maneuvering inside the case.  Detachable bracket and case cover combined let the case maintain full structural integrity, becoming a self-supported body, which is the same concept that is used in modern car design. 
 

Solid Riser Grip 
 



 


  Sentry uses its own elegant solution that keeps PCI-E riser tightly in place by its plastic body without straining its weld-points. Riser is installed by sliding it into a gap in central wall with two screws tightening this gap's grasp on riser.
 

Air Pocket over GPU 
 



 


  The case cover is equipped with a special insertion that creates small air pocket and partitions the space above graphics card, which limits recirculation of hot air in graphics card chamber, effectively increasing thermal performance.
 

Minimalistic PSU Mount 
 



 


  Sentry keeps the power supply in place with 3 screws and a grasp of the front wall. This minimalistic mount design lets the user maneuver freely while installing the motherboard before power supply is installed.   The distance from the side wall and flexibility of Sentry's internal power cord's connector are calculated to support multiple configurations of power connector's location and rotation on the power supply's wall.
 

Multiple Configurations 
 



 


 Finally, to adapt to various use scenarios, Sentry provides multiple 2.5"" mounting points that are availiable depending on components that may or may not require to use additional space. Sentry's product page has a visual tool that lets the user test the possible hardware configurations.  

Extensively Prototyped 
 



 

 
Design and prototyping stage of the project took over two years to ensure that case body can be manufactured in target quantity.Over that time we have completed six functional prototypes while also improving case hardware support, external design, ease of use and performance.


 

Optimized Design 
 



 






During case development numerous simulations were run to optimize vent layout for the best possible airflow and thermal performance. 
 

Supreme Matte Finish 
 



 


 We have tested multiple paint types looking for an optimal surface finish, to finally decide on high-graininess structural powder coating, which gives the surface a quality look and feel. 
 

Production Tested 
 



 


 A few small production batches were made to test fitting repeatability, pinpoint possible manufacturing errors and update designs to improve overall production quality. 
  

100 Units Funding Goal 
 



 

 Sentry's body is designed to be manufactured without mass production tooling, which means it can be manufactured in really small quantities. A minimum of 100 units is a quantity required to get wholesale prices for the components that are also included, such as PCI-E riser, power switch etc. Considering all the interest in Sentry, the 100 units target of this campaign is just a small fraction of interested enthusiasts around the world, which means there is virtually no chance that this campaign will fall short of its target.
 

Made in Poland 
 



 

 Sentry was designed and will be manufactured and assembled in Poland. This way we can control the manufacturing process in order to maintain required quality according to specification. 
 

Help us Deliver Faster 
 



 

 We need your help in this campaign because preparing a big batch at once lets us optimize production and deliver Sentry to you and other enthusiasts faster than running sales through multiple worldwide retailers with small initial stock. All perks will be delivered in form Sentry revision 1.1 units which have all the improvements made from feedback we received after shipping revision 1.0 samples for review.

<h3>Photographers Rights</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Pietro Zuco and I’m the programmer behind the iPhone app called Photographers Rights. The app is free and you can <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photographers-rights/id458324345?ls=1&amp;mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""iTunes Store Photographer Rights"">download the current version here.</a></p>
<p>Photographers Rights is an application that helps photographers to have an idea about the laws related with photography in different countries. Every country has different regulations and laws about photography, not only about where it is allowed or prohibited to take pictures, but also about copyright.</p>
<p>The idea to create this app was born back in 2011, in a coffee shop in Akihabara, Japan. I was talking with my friend Steve Nagata about technology and photography. I wanted to create a photography related app and he gave me the idea and inspiration to create an app to help photographers with their legal rights around the world. <strong>I’m not a lawyer</strong>, so I then contacted a <strong>legal advisor</strong>, Pepi Valderrama to create the content of this application.</p>
<h3>Current App Description</h3>
<p>Photographers Rights has 5 sections.</p>
<p><strong>1. Countries</strong></p>
<p>This section covers laws and regulations for: USA, Australia, Canada, UK, Japan, Spain, Italy and France. For example you can find information about what kind of laws apply for taking photos of free passengers in UK or taking a photo to a public place in France.</p>
<p><strong>2. Legal</strong></p>
<p>This section covers general legal content that is compatible internationally with almost all countries. Your rights as a photographer, Copyright and Privacy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Contracts</strong></p>
<p>In this section there are sample contracts, ready to use in English, Spanish, Italian and French. You can print them, send by email or save them in other apps, like Good Reader or Dropbox. </p>
<p><strong>4. Questions</strong></p>
<p>In this section you can play common phrases pronounced by native speakers. Questions like ""May I take you a picture?"" or ""Ar you a police officer?"" Supported languages are French, Japanese, Spanish, Catalan, Italian, German and even an Austrian dialect. You don't have to read them, the iPhone will play them for you using a native speaker voice for each language.</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>I want to improve this app and that costs money and time. That's why I need your help. These are the main improvements:</p>
<p><strong>1. English proof reading of the content.</strong></p>
<p>The application was written by a legal advisor, which is also a language warrior but English wasn't her native language. So we need to improve the grammar and the form of the content of this app.</p>
<p><strong>2. Android version!</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people asked about an Android version. I'm not an Android developer, I'm a photographer and an iOS developer. So I need to hire an Android developer to create a working version of Photographers Rights for Android users as well.</p>
<p><strong>3. iPad version</strong></p>
<p>Many people asked for an iPad version. The current app is only for the iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>4. Increase the languages in the Question section.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people asked for Russian, Portuguese, Chinese and Cantonese. These new languages will be added but I will try to add more.</p>
<p>* You can be listed in the app as a contributor, only if you wish so :) *</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help.</p>
<p>Share this campaign with your friends, in your social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and so forth. Even if you are not a photographer, maybe you have a photographer friend that will be interested in this project.</p>
<p>Use the Indiegogo social buttons at the end of this text to share among your friends.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping in this campaign!!</p>

<p>* This is a flexible founding. It means that if we reach the goal, I will be able to implement all the promised functionalities. However, if we don't reach the goal, I will only be able to implement some functions, depending on the received amount. For example, maybe I won't be able to pay for the English proof reading, which is quite expensive. In that case,  the perks that include the content of the app in PDF, will be delivered as they are in the current version.  Or maybe I will be able to pay the English proof reading, and sacrifice the Android version.</p>
<p>If we surpass the goal, of course I will do my best to try to implement even more features. </p>
<p>So please spread the word, so we can reach the goal!! Thanks!! :)</p>

2. Android version!
A lot of people asked about an Android version. I'm not an Android developer, I'm a photographer and an iOS developer. So I need to hire an Android developer to create a working version of Photographers Rights for Android users as well.
3. iPad version
Many people asked for an iPad version. The current app is only for the iPhone.
4. Increase the languages in the Question section.
A lot of people asked for Russian, Portuguese, Chinese and Cantonese. These new languages will be added but I will try to add more.
* You can be listed in the app as a contributor, only if you wish so :) *

* This is a flexible founding. It means that if we reach the goal, I will be able to implement all the promised functionalities. However, if we don't reach the goal, I will only be able to implement some functions, depending on the received amount. For example, maybe I won't be able to pay for the English proof reading, which is quite expensive. In that case,  the perks that include the content of the app in PDF, will be delivered as they are in the current version.  Or maybe I will be able to pay the English proof reading, and sacrifice the Android version.
If we surpass the goal, of course I will do my best to try to implement even more features. 
So please spread the word, so we can reach the goal!! Thanks!! :)",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

John’s business and investment experience, entrepreneurial spirit and passion for new technology set the wheels in motion to develop a solution.

We have flown round the world and back, met with designers, tech experts, manufacturers, chosen leather, materials and sourced everything we need to make a seamless product.

<p>We've done the hard yards to find the best suppliers and manufactures. We have narrowed down our partners to ensure we can deliver on quality, time and price.</p>
<p>We have expedited the process by paying the tooling and development costs upfront so we can enter production as soon as possible but we still need to fund:</p>

<p><strong><strong>Can the Hustle Charge Pad charge my Qi enabled smartphone?<br/></strong></strong>Yes! The Hustle Charge Pad is compatible with all Qi integrated wireless induction charging devices. For a list of Qi integrated phones <a href=""http://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/data/downloadables/1/0/7/8/20130222-wpc_38_qi_phones.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Qi Integrated Phones"">click here</a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Will it work with my iPhone?<br/></strong></span>Yes! We developed the Hustle Bag to power iPhone 4/4S, iPhone 5 and pretty much every other smartphone out there.</p>
<p><span><strong>What smartphones will it charge?<br/></strong></span>A Hustle Bag will power any smartphone with a micro USB, iPhone4/4s or iPhone 5 connection. </p>
<p><span><strong>How long will the battery last?<br/></strong></span>A Hustle Bag, Clutch or Wallet will power your phone up to 4 times before needing to be recharged. However, every smartphone model has a different battery so this is only a range.</p>
<p>As an example, if you have an iPhone 5, you should get two and half full charges before needing to recharge your Hustle Bag.</p>
<p><span><strong>How does the wireless charging work?<br/></strong></span>We have incorporated wireless induction charging technology into the bag so you don’t need to plug it in when you get home. It just makes life that little bit easier. </p>
<p><span><strong>How does my phone connect to a Hustle Bag?<br/></strong></span>We have chosen to incorporate a cable that neatly fits into the bag and easily connects to your phone. Designed by Hustle, we have kept the style, quality and usability consistent with the overall look and feel of the product.</p>
<p><span>Using a cable allowed us to do two things; 1. make the bag compatible across all smartphones AND 2. it allows you to pick up your phone to check messages and reply to emails without stopping and starting the charging process, which will damage your phone battery.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How will I know when my Hustle Bag is running out of power?<br/></strong></span>We have incorporated a battery monitor into the Hustle Power Pack that will alert you when the power level drops below 25%. Quite simply, if your Hustle Bag has less than 25% power, it will give you an alert tone when you plug in your phone, similar to the tone when you plug your smartphone in to charge.</p>
<p><span><strong>How heavy is a Hustle Bag?<br/></strong></span>The Hustle Bag is very light. The Hustle Power Pack is only 9mm thick, making it one of the thinnest battery packs in the world! All up, it weighs approximately 200g. </p>
<p><span><strong>How do I know it is good quality technology?<br/></strong></span>Our production partners manufacture batteries and electronics for some of the largest household brands. The technology included in the Hustle Bags and Charge Pads should keep your phone going like a “bunny” - if you get what we mean!</p>
<p><span>All of our products have already undergone rigorous safety and certification testing to ensure they are of the highest standard.</span> </p>
<p><span><strong>What is included with each product?<br/></strong></span>Each Hustle Bag, Clutch or Wallet will come in a beautifully finished Hustle Gift Box, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hustle Bag of your choice in dust bag</span></li>
<li><span>Hustle Charge Pad</span></li>
<li><span>Power Adaptor - we will try to match the wall adaptor to the delivery country (unless otherwise specified)</span></li>
<li><span>Micro USB, iPhone 4/4S and iPhone 5 snap-on connectors</span></li>
<li>
<span>User Manual</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong><strong>What happens if we don't reach our funding goal?<br/></strong></strong>If we don't reach our $75,000 funding goal, all pre-order will definitely be delivered! However, not all colours will be available. A</span>s we hit certain levels of funding, we will unlock more colours.</p>
<p><strong>What if I love a certain colour but it is still locked? Should I still contribute?<br/></strong>Absolutely! Every contribution helps unlock the next colour. If you contribute we will do our best to ensure you are totally satisfied with your Hustle Bag!</p>
<p><span><strong><strong>If I chose the FIRST 50 perk, when do I choose my style and colour?<br/></strong></strong>Following the end of the campaign (11th of August), backers will be contacted to confirm styles, colour choices and shipping details.</span></p>
<p><strong>When do I choose the colour of my Hustle product?</strong><br/>Following the end of the campaign (11th of August), backers will be contacted to confirm colour choices and shipping details.</p>
<p><span><strong>Am I suppose to manually add shipping if I'm not in Australia?<br/></strong>Yes, you have to add international shipping on top of your selected perk. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What do I need to do if I forget to pay for shipping?<br/></strong>No problem, just click CONTRIBUTE NOW and put in the actual amount you need to pay. Select ""No perk, I just want to contribute."" Pay for it and done!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are the dimensions of the Hustle Bag/Clutch/Wallet?<br/></strong>Bag/Clutch: Height (14cm) x Wide (20cmm)<br/> Wallet: Height (9.5cm) x Wide (21.5cmm) </span></p>
<p><span><strong>How can I update my address?<br/></strong>Please contact us at the email below.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>I'd like to buy 2 or more Hustle products, can I pay extra using the same perk?<br/></strong>No, unless you choose the “Corporate Pack” (10x) or more perk options, you would have to make a separate contribution.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Will Hustle have shipping issues with countries like Germany, Italy and the EU?<br/></strong>No. All Hustle products will be sent through world class logistics companies with supporting certification paperwork. i.e. CE, FCC, etc. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Will I have to pay import tax, duty or VAT?<br/></strong>Contributors will be responsible for any import tax, duty or VAT that arises.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How do I upgrade my perk?<br/></strong></span><span>No problem, just click CONTRIBUTE NOW and put in the difference you need to pay to upgrade. Select ""No perk, I just want to contribute."" Pay for it and email us at the below to inform us of the change.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>I would like to buy the accessories too, can I do that in 1 contribution?<br/></strong>Unfortunately, you will have to pay in 2 separate contributions.</span></p>

Compatible to power the following smartphone brands - and many more:

How do we do it? Easy.
Each Hustle Bag is fitted with a micro USB connection plus a snap-on iPhone 4/4S and iPhone 5 connector - so you don’t have to change your Hustle Bag every time you change your phone.
Each Hustle Bag will come in a beautifully presented gift box, with a Hustle Charge Pad and will power any smartphone. Made from the highest quality materials, we will offer two style options for women and one style for men.
Made from the finest leather, the Hustle Bag includes a matching long, detachable cross-body strap. Wear it effortlessly on its own as a bag or a clutch, or simply inside your bigger handbag.





Made from high quality faux leather, the Hustle Clutch will include a matching wristlet strap. Wear it as a clutch, or use it as an insert with your bigger handbag.

Made from the finest leather, the Hustle Wallet is a full size men's wallet. When you feel like travelling lighter, the middle section pops out, folds in half and fits in your back pocket.







Hustle is a small company with big ideas. A husband and wife team who were looking for a solution to an everyday problem. As a mother, a business owner and social media addict, Lisa found the battery life of her smartphone limited the productivity of her day. John’s business and investment experience, entrepreneurial spirit and passion for new technology set the wheels in motion to develop a solution. Having spent every spare minute and too many late nights, nurturing the idea and working on perfecting every aspect of the Hustle Bag, we are finally ready, excited and proud to introduce our ""baby"" to the world.
We have been working on this for over a year. We have flown round the world and back, met with designers, tech experts, manufacturers, chosen leather, materials and sourced everything we need to make a seamless product. The product has been tested, certified and is ready for large scale production.
We've done the hard yards to find the best suppliers and manufactures. We have narrowed down our partners to ensure we can deliver on quality, time and price.
We have expedited the process by paying the tooling and development costs upfront so we can enter production as soon as possible but we still need to fund:

Large component order
Bag manufacturing
Large scale packaging order







 
Following the end of the campaign (11th of August), backers will be contacted to confirm colour choices and shipping details. If you would like more information on this, please refer to the FAQ section below.
We have subsidised the shipping costs to get your Hustle Bag to you a little bit cheaper. Plus Australian shipping is FREE!
If you live outside of Australia, shipping will be a flat fee of $20 for each Hustle Bag.

You can add the shipping cost to the perk's contribution, or by making a different free contribution. For Corporate Packs, you can multiply the shipping fee with the number of Hustle Bags.
For example, if you live in the US and you selected a Hustle Clutch, the contribution field will display $139. To add $20 for postage, you'll have to manually type in $159. Orders will not be shipped without pre-paid shipping. If you forget, we will send you a friendly reminder before your order is ready to go.


Can the Hustle Charge Pad charge my Qi enabled smartphone?Yes! The Hustle Charge Pad is compatible with all Qi integrated wireless induction charging devices. For a list of Qi integrated phones click here.
Will it work with my iPhone?Yes! We developed the Hustle Bag to power iPhone 4/4S, iPhone 5 and pretty much every other smartphone out there.
What smartphones will it charge?A Hustle Bag will power any smartphone with a micro USB, iPhone4/4s or iPhone 5 connection. 
How long will the battery last?A Hustle Bag, Clutch or Wallet will power your phone up to 4 times before needing to be recharged. However, every smartphone model has a different battery so this is only a range.
As an example, if you have an iPhone 5, you should get two and half full charges before needing to recharge your Hustle Bag.
How does the wireless charging work?We have incorporated wireless induction charging technology into the bag so you don’t need to plug it in when you get home. It just makes life that little bit easier. 
How does my phone connect to a Hustle Bag?We have chosen to incorporate a cable that neatly fits into the bag and easily connects to your phone. Designed by Hustle, we have kept the style, quality and usability consistent with the overall look and feel of the product.
Using a cable allowed us to do two things; 1. make the bag compatible across all smartphones AND 2. it allows you to pick up your phone to check messages and reply to emails without stopping and starting the charging process, which will damage your phone battery.
How will I know when my Hustle Bag is running out of power?We have incorporated a battery monitor into the Hustle Power Pack that will alert you when the power level drops below 25%. Quite simply, if your Hustle Bag has less than 25% power, it will give you an alert tone when you plug in your phone, similar to the tone when you plug your smartphone in to charge.
How heavy is a Hustle Bag?The Hustle Bag is very light. The Hustle Power Pack is only 9mm thick, making it one of the thinnest battery packs in the world! All up, it weighs approximately 200g. 
How do I know it is good quality technology?Our production partners manufacture batteries and electronics for some of the largest household brands. The technology included in the Hustle Bags and Charge Pads should keep your phone going like a “bunny” - if you get what we mean!
All of our products have already undergone rigorous safety and certification testing to ensure they are of the highest standard. 
What is included with each product?Each Hustle Bag, Clutch or Wallet will come in a beautifully finished Hustle Gift Box, including:

Hustle Bag of your choice in dust bag
Hustle Charge Pad
Power Adaptor - we will try to match the wall adaptor to the delivery country (unless otherwise specified)
Micro USB, iPhone 4/4S and iPhone 5 snap-on connectors

User Manual 

What happens if we don't reach our funding goal?If we don't reach our $75,000 funding goal, all pre-order will definitely be delivered! However, not all colours will be available. As we hit certain levels of funding, we will unlock more colours.
What if I love a certain colour but it is still locked? Should I still contribute?Absolutely! Every contribution helps unlock the next colour. If you contribute we will do our best to ensure you are totally satisfied with your Hustle Bag!
If I chose the FIRST 50 perk, when do I choose my style and colour?Following the end of the campaign (11th of August), backers will be contacted to confirm styles, colour choices and shipping details.
When do I choose the colour of my Hustle product?Following the end of the campaign (11th of August), backers will be contacted to confirm colour choices and shipping details.
Am I suppose to manually add shipping if I'm not in Australia?Yes, you have to add international shipping on top of your selected perk. 
What do I need to do if I forget to pay for shipping?No problem, just click CONTRIBUTE NOW and put in the actual amount you need to pay. Select ""No perk, I just want to contribute."" Pay for it and done!
What are the dimensions of the Hustle Bag/Clutch/Wallet?Bag/Clutch: Height (14cm) x Wide (20cmm) Wallet: Height (9.5cm) x Wide (21.5cmm) 
How can I update my address?Please contact us at the email below.
I'd like to buy 2 or more Hustle products, can I pay extra using the same perk?No, unless you choose the “Corporate Pack” (10x) or more perk options, you would have to make a separate contribution.
Will Hustle have shipping issues with countries like Germany, Italy and the EU?No. All Hustle products will be sent through world class logistics companies with supporting certification paperwork. i.e. CE, FCC, etc. 
Will I have to pay import tax, duty or VAT?Contributors will be responsible for any import tax, duty or VAT that arises.
How do I upgrade my perk?No problem, just click CONTRIBUTE NOW and put in the difference you need to pay to upgrade. Select ""No perk, I just want to contribute."" Pay for it and email us at the below to inform us of the change.
I would like to buy the accessories too, can I do that in 1 contribution?Unfortunately, you will have to pay in 2 separate contributions.",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>➣ What Makes Up Helix's Design?</h1>
<p><b><i>Design Mindset:</i> </b>We believe that the most interesting things happen in the in-between spaces. Therefore, in the research phase of Helix we looked at both <b>fashion</b> and <b>tech</b> - the catwalk stuff and engineering. We wanted to create something new and usually new things come together from existing elements put together in a novel way.</p>

<p>The unique looping design of Helix allows you to wrap the connecting cord for the earphones into a groove on the wrist cuff when the headset is not in use. A tiny cache on the cuff provides a convenient place to put the earphones.</p>
<p><b><i>Earbuds:</i></b> Helix is designed to make the headphones look natural when in use. Measured to the perfect length, the headphones are short enough to wear on your wrist and long enough to comfortably sit in your ears.</p>

<p><i><b>Materials:</b></i> Since it’s a wearable product, it’s important to choose a chemical-resistant material that is durable for everyday use and flexible for bending. The material of the cuff is hypoallergenic and will not cause irritation. The earbud compartment on the cuff is made out of stainless steel with PVD coating on the surface. The stainless steel provides a rigid structure to hold the earbuds inside of the housing. It also adds just the right amount of weight to deliver the premium user experience of wearing a durable and valuable accessory. The PVD coating provides a mirror gloss effect which is an important aesthetic element for the design story.</p>

<h1>➣ What Is The Technology Behind Helix?</h1>
<p>Compromising earbud size and sound quality gave us lots of design constraints, but at the same time, constraints are fundamental for design and they pushed us to be more creative. The Helix is made so that it contains high quality sound in conveniently small headphones. It was challenging to engineer this given the incredibly small sizes of the speakers, but our engineers managed to overcome this obstacle impressively. </p>
<p><b>CD-Like High Quality Stereo Audio: </b></p>
<p>The Helix's headphones feature <b>aptX®</b> audio technology that can deliver CD-like quality audio over a Bluetooth® connection. High quality, stereo music playback is enabled across aptX source devices like TV’s, phones, and tablets with a Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447718987/oznzkkemoqppgfucgujj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Multipoint Connectivity:</b> </p>
<p><b>Two devices</b> can connect simultaneously to the Helix Cuff via Bluetooth. This enables users to switch seamlessly between two devices. You connect Helix headphones to your desktop (or tablet) and your smartphone at the same time. While you're streaming music from your desktop (or your tablet) and receive an incoming call to your smartphone, the call will be automatically streamed to your Helix headphones. Multipoint connectivity makes it easy for you to switch audio sources between two devices without the constant hassle of pairing.</p>

<p><b>Audio Enhancement and Bi-directional Noise Reduction: </b></p>
<p>Helix headphones are equipped with <b>cVc® technology</b>. cVc brings advanced audio enhancements and noise suppression to the near and far end, as well as providing packet loss and bit error concealment to deliver the best possible call quality on the Bluetooth headset.</p>

</div>","HELIX: The World's First Wearable Cuff with Stereo Bluetooth Headphones







Fashion and functionality are the principles on which the Helix was created. Helix solves the problem of dealing with tangled and easy to lose headphones. What do you do with your headphones when they aren’t plugged in? Instead of keeping them in your pocket or purse, access them in a fashion-forward cuff for easy convenience. It can take minutes to unravel earbuds. With Helix, you’ll plug in your headphones in just seconds.



Always On and Always in Style

Helix was designed for people who are always on and always in style. We want to create something unique for music-lovers, tech users, and smartphone mavens. We want to deliver an incredible sound experience in a wearable that’s on the cutting edge of modern fashion trends. Our goal is to make carrying headphones convenient and fashionable. The discreet, miniature compartment inside Helix accomplishes just that.



How HELIX Works

We’ve created a wearable that complements your style and takes your tech to a whole new level.

➣ Helix Featured In:

 

➣ What Makes Up Helix's Design?
Design Mindset: We believe that the most interesting things happen in the in-between spaces. Therefore, in the research phase of Helix we looked at both fashion and tech - the catwalk stuff and engineering. We wanted to create something new and usually new things come together from existing elements put together in a novel way.



We created Helix knowing that the human wrist is valuable real estate. We knew we would have to provide a lot of value in order to persuade people use a wearable that they will see all the time. It's a lot different from something you would carry in your pocket or purse. We paid a lot of attention to the quality of the aesthetics and materials and created a design that looks sleek and stylish, feels comfortable, and cleverly hides its technological power.

Cuff: It’s the loop design that makes Helix fit to your wrist. Three magnets on one side of the loop connect with the other side to adjust to your wrist size. It takes seconds to slip on and fit to your size. That’s just part of why we love Helix’s loop design. 

A 360 View of Helix's Iconic Loop Design
It’s thinnest right below your wrist, where you want it to be, so that you can rest your arm on a table normally. This was one of the main drivers for the Helix’s design. We realized that usability is extremely important for a wearable product.



A loop with a soft curvature is a pain to build. Especially when you add wired earbuds into the mix. Helix has a pretty complex entity of design elements. The challenge is how to make everything look and feel nice.

Single Loop Design Fits Three Different Sizes

The unique looping design of Helix allows you to wrap the connecting cord for the earphones into a groove on the wrist cuff when the headset is not in use. A tiny cache on the cuff provides a convenient place to put the earphones.
Earbuds: Helix is designed to make the headphones look natural when in use. Measured to the perfect length, the headphones are short enough to wear on your wrist and long enough to comfortably sit in your ears.




A light shines through the center of the control unit to signal that Bluetooth is on and your device is connected.

Materials: Since it’s a wearable product, it’s important to choose a chemical-resistant material that is durable for everyday use and flexible for bending. The material of the cuff is hypoallergenic and will not cause irritation. The earbud compartment on the cuff is made out of stainless steel with PVD coating on the surface. The stainless steel provides a rigid structure to hold the earbuds inside of the housing. It also adds just the right amount of weight to deliver the premium user experience of wearing a durable and valuable accessory. The PVD coating provides a mirror gloss effect which is an important aesthetic element for the design story.

Design Process: The design process consisted of multiple iterations. We went through hundreds of sketches to find the right look. 3D Prints were a useful tool in testing models. Finally, we narrowed the design down to a few prototypes until we found Helix.

Many Iterations of Development and Prototyping
➣ What Is The Technology Behind Helix?
Compromising earbud size and sound quality gave us lots of design constraints, but at the same time, constraints are fundamental for design and they pushed us to be more creative. The Helix is made so that it contains high quality sound in conveniently small headphones. It was challenging to engineer this given the incredibly small sizes of the speakers, but our engineers managed to overcome this obstacle impressively. 
CD-Like High Quality Stereo Audio: 
The Helix's headphones feature aptX® audio technology that can deliver CD-like quality audio over a Bluetooth® connection. High quality, stereo music playback is enabled across aptX source devices like TV’s, phones, and tablets with a Bluetooth connection.


Multipoint Connectivity: 
Two devices can connect simultaneously to the Helix Cuff via Bluetooth. This enables users to switch seamlessly between two devices. You connect Helix headphones to your desktop (or tablet) and your smartphone at the same time. While you're streaming music from your desktop (or your tablet) and receive an incoming call to your smartphone, the call will be automatically streamed to your Helix headphones. Multipoint connectivity makes it easy for you to switch audio sources between two devices without the constant hassle of pairing.


Audio Enhancement and Bi-directional Noise Reduction: 
Helix headphones are equipped with cVc® technology. cVc brings advanced audio enhancements and noise suppression to the near and far end, as well as providing packet loss and bit error concealment to deliver the best possible call quality on the Bluetooth headset.

The Gold Edition Helix Cuff
With a perfectly structured look and feel, we aimed to make Helix an accessory that cleverly masks its technological power so that both men and women can wear it with complete comfort and versatility. The design celebrates functionality.



From your home, to the office, about town and to the gym, the Helix Cuff is the first product of its kind to keep music lovers and other audiophiles stylishly and conveniently connected without compromising fashion sense or sound quality.



Helix offers complete versatility. Easily pair it with whatever you’re wearing without having to worry that the Helix won't work with your outfit. The Helix’s designer brand ensures quality and style. The aesthetic value of Helix is not something to be ignored. It’s designed to last as fashion moves forward. Both men and women deserve to have tech that looks this good, so we’ve designed Helix to work for any gender.




➣ What Makes Helix Awesome:


On the Go Access: Music is always on hand with Helix. Wherever you go, it goes. Remembering to bring your headphones is easy when they’re right on your wrist.

Holiday Gift: Share the joy of Helix and please that person who seems to have everything. This innovation in wearable tech is sure to wow.


➣ Why Helix?
Amidst the wearables market, which is overflowing with fitness trackers, biomarkers, and smart watches, there has never existed a complementary accessory allowing you to effortlessly keep your headphones with you at all times—until Helix. 
A headset is something you want with you wherever you go. Most of us just throw headphones into something we carry with us and later spend hours untangling them. Helix is an elegant solution to this problem. Instant connection to music, podcasts, or phone calls becomes a reality.
We’re all “always on” in this digital age. According to a PR Newswire study, on average we use headphones for four hours a day. The majority of those surveyed had 3 or more pairs of headphones with 48% using them every day. Constantly taking the extra time to deal with earphones is an unnecessary waste. Traditional wired earphones can be hard to carry and untangle. Say goodbye to inconvenience and stay connected. Effortlessly store your headphones with Helix.
Let HELIX be a part of your daily life
“Fundamentally, the marriage of fashion and functional design to create a storage element for headphones simply didn’t exist,” said Mika Nenonen, the Chief Designer of the Helix Cuff.
