<h3>Stephanie Patrick Dance</h3>
<p>SPD was formed in 2012, when I was first invited to create a professional piece in Austin, Texas. The company now resides in the Bay Area, and it has been good to us!! The company was awarded Principal Creative and Performing Arts first-ever Starving Artists Award in 2015, two residencies at SAFE House Arts, and has been photographed by San Franciscan photographer, Karin Velasco.</p>
<p><b>What makes SPD different </b>is its emphasis on a deconstructed musical theater formula, replacing scene text with spoken word poetry, and combining the presentational aspects of theater dance with the more internal, concert forms of dance. In an SPD show, you’re likely to see a duet between a modern dancer and a tap dancer, or a piece in which hip-hop and jazz collide, followed by a slam-style delivery of a poem.</p>
<p><b>SPD has big plans for its upcoming season, and we need you to make it happen!!</b> To learn more about the company, visit <a href=""http://www.stephaniepatrick.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.StephaniePatrick.me</a>, or email me directly at <a href=""mailto:stephanie10103@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stephanie10103@gmail.com</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
<div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
It takes a lot of time and cost to become a functioning professional dance company! The biggest expense is <b>paying the production team what they deserve </b>for their hours of work--it takes lifelong training to become a professional artist, and most industry level professionals are underpaid. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Please show my team your appreciation!</span>
</div>
<div><h3>Funding Breakdown</h3></div>
<div>$600.00 - We are asking only for artist compensation! Each artist involved in production will receive $10/hr for their work on the film. This amount does not include reimbursements for park fees, costume fees, or any other expenses. Our team is:</div>

<h3>The Play</h3>
<p>Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Lizard-Worshipper: no matter how you were brought up, religion has affected us all. This show tells the true story of being a queer vegan in North Carolina who happened to be raised a little differently than everyone else. A mix of storytelling, song, characters, and dance makes this show a true “cult classic.” You will laugh, cringe, breath deep, and walk away with a whole new perspective on your own upbringing after seeing this show. </p>

<p><strong>Why We're Here:</strong></p>
<p>One night while working the graveyard shift at a roller disco in Marfa, TX, Donna and Colby are smacked with a surprise: The Apocalypse!  Skating through a honky tonk disco fugue, the ladies are left to figure out who they are, what it all means, and if anything even matters at all.</p>
<p>This is <strong>ROLLER DYNASTY.</strong></p>
<p>We love that this play celebrates and investigates female friendship, and puts young intelligent women at the forefront!  In roller skates! We can’t wait to bring this brand new play to life in Los Angeles.  But for this, we need your help.</p>
<p>Things like rehearsal space, innovative designers, insurance, disco balls and rollerskates all cost money.  Below, we've included a pie chart of how we will divy up the money we raise.  The more we end up with, the higher our production value, ability to pay our actors, etc etc.  Check us out, and please donate!</p>

<h3>Promenade Opera Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are an innovative immersive opera company founded in 2017, are dedicated to opening relevant opera experiences to the greater Boston community, <i>while </i>advocating for emerging young artists. In today's arts culture, opera is often shrugged off as stuffy, boring, and unintelligible. We strive to reverse that thinking by producing immersive modern adaptations of classic operas with relevant themes and important stories for our time and allowing our artists to use their prodigious gifts to breathe life into classic works and allow them to be as new and important as they ever were.<br/> </li>
<li><p>Our third annual production, <strong>Bellini’s <i>La Sonnambula</i></strong>, will be performed at Rengo Studios of Auspicious Phoenix Productions in Somerville, MA and sung in Italian.</p></li>
<li><p>Our immersive show, directed by Dan Rogers and designed by Joseph Wolfslau, will guide audiences through the dreamscape of Bellini’s beautiful sleepwalking bel canto masterpiece. That’s right! A moving production! Join us for the operatic experience of a lifetime and become part of the story!</p></li>
<li>For too long opera has been thought of as stuffy or elite. You can help us to bring the beauty, truth, conversation, and challenge of this art into our times and your life! Become a true patron of the artists and the arts. Join us!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need <strong>$5000 </strong>to pay our talented team of artists and designers!</p>
<p>As a company we are committed to supporting young artists, not only by providing innovative performance opportunities, but also by prioritizing open book compensation. 69% of our budget goes directly to artist fees. Beyond that we also participate in a profit sharing program, in which our artists all receive an even percentage split on profits once production costs are covered. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Beyond that, all additional donations will go towards space rental and production costs!</p></li>
<li>
<p>For generous contributors, we have company merchandise like <strong>Signed Posters</strong> of this show and previous productions.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have a <strong>Virtual Ticket</strong> option! Whether you're out of town for the live performance, or want to be able to enjoy the show again and again, we will send you a video of the show from the audience's perspective for your viewing pleasure!</p>
<p>Get the ultimate immersion experience, choose our <strong>Immersive Role</strong> perk and be IN the show! We will costume you, instruct you of your duties, and give you a chance to see the show from the inside!</p>
<p>For our most generous tier of donors, we can even design a <strong>B</strong><strong>espoke Immersive Aria and Scene night </strong>at a location of your choosing! Just select the top most tier!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>In our current times of unrest and instability, we <i>need</i> art to see the beauty of the world, but also to challenge us and ask questions about how we interact with the world. POP, since its first production, has shared operas unique aptitude for opening us to exactly that conversation with diverse audiences in exciting new venues and situations!<br/> </li>
<li>This is our third main stage production! All of our productions have sold out every performance, paid all artists, and successfully helped to seed further endeavors - even including launching new ventures like commissioning new works to support not only young performers and designers, but also new composers!<br/> </li>
<li>From our humble beginnings putting on Justice or Mercy, we have since grown in each production to feature more new artists, explore more new spaces, and form more connections to the community!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Opera is a risky business that frequently does not pay for itself, or if it does, it frequently does so by settling for less exciting or revolutionary productions!  We, however, have shown in our past productions that we do not have to accept that false dichotomy! Through inventive use of space and working directly with artists, we have found that we can make opera that is ethical, artistically fulfilling, AND fiscally responsible!<br/> </li>
<li><p>Through  careful budgeting and direct work with Boston artists to cut out the middle-man of agents, expensive travel costs, and unpaid Young Artist opportunities, we are able to put your money where it can do the most good  Working with talented young artists and offering them the chance to create something truly fantastic and new, we are able to work less expensively and guarantee that the beneficiaries of our work are the audience and the artists, rather than artistic establishment. </p></li>

<p>Greetings! We are Coffee &amp; Whiskey Productions! If you don't know us yet, you should, becuase we're doing things! Big Things! Well it depends on how you define big, but still-- things! </p>
<p>Coffee &amp; Whiskey was founded in 2014 by Matt Diel and Nic Wehrwein, two playwrights fed up with the traditional model of play readings, who decided to do something about it. Coffee &amp; Whiskey wants to create something of real value for playwrights and audiences. Our goal is not only to create kick-ass entertaining theatre that makes you laugh and cry and sing along, but also to change the conversations that happen during new play development. Making them better... stronger... faster. We can rebuild them. We have the technology. But we need your help to do it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>
<p>The Coffee &amp; Whiskey season is made up of the Script Pub (our developmental reading series), and only recently added, The Productions (our series of fully produced works).</p>
<p>Over the last 4 seasons of the Script Pub, we've been fortunate to present fourteen fantastic plays, written by an amazing collection of playwrights from all over these United States, showcasing O'Neill finalists, National Latino Playwrighting Award Winners, and Kilroy List honorees. We’ve seen houses held together by faith and sweater yarn; we’ve seen cosmic love stories; we’ve grappled with family secrets and personal revelations, and it has all been unbelievably awesome.</p>
<p>Hand in hand with the Script Pub are the Productions: fully produced plays in limited-run engagements. 2017 was our inaugural year, in which we produced our first two original works, including the soon-to-be-world-famous Coffee &amp; Whiskey signature show, Karaoke Night at Al Capone’s House of Pancakes! It has been amazing and gratifying and humbling. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your Role in The Madness</strong></p>
<p>As always, what we're in search of is a gigantic pile of money. Once obtained, we will take that pile of money and place it in an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and dive in a la Scrooge McDuck. Once we finish doing that, we will take the money out of the pool and exchange it for goods and services. Thus will the Coffee &amp; Whiskey season be born!</p>
<p>Seriously though, each and every thing we do requires money, for such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>theatre space</li>
<li>pizza</li>
<li>rehearsal space</li>
<li>the time and talent of the artists involved</li>
<li>seriously, a staggering amount of pizza</li>
</ul>
<p>100% of the money we earn from this campaign will go directly to funding Coffee &amp; Whiskey’s general operations fund—paying the artists, renting the spaces, set-building materials, all that coffee you drink at the Script Pubs, the whole shebang. And everything helps. Whether you have one dollar or a hundred dollars or ten thousand dollars, we can and will use it to make theatre happen. (Obviously, we’ll make a lot more theatre with the ten thousand dollars than with the one dollar, but hey, we work with what we have.)</p>
<p>And hey, to sweeten the deal for you, we've procured some sweet (and in some cases, unique) perks for your enjoyment! Stickers and T-shirts and mugs and pint glasses and limited-edition hoodies and probably some other secret things that we can’t talk about now because Russia is probably listening and you know they’re up to no good and probably SPECTRE is lurking around and maybe Dr. Claw also.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why It’s Important</strong></p>
<p>""Theatre is Conversation"" is more than just a pithy motto—it’s our guiding principle. We believe in fostering the true, honest conversations that are so very vital to us as playwrights, as actors, as audience members, and as human beings. That only happens when everyone has an equal voice. At Coffee &amp; Whiskey, we say come as you are, and screw all the people who say you can’t or shouldn’t. Raise your voice above theirs and join the conversation.</p>
<p>This is where they say we’re supposed to talk about our playwrights’ success and the great things we’ve accomplished and how generally cool we are. But we’d much rather let some of our collaborators speak for themselves:</p>
<p><i>“I have worked with Coffee &amp; Whiskey Productions twice and had amazing experiences both times... without the feedback that I got from Coffee &amp; Whiskey Productions I do not think I would have been able to make the progress on that play that I made.” – Casey Mraz, author of</i> The Giraffe</p>
<p><i>“When so many submissions either go unanswered or are met with a simple automated rejection email, I greatly appreciated that they were willing to be honest with me, and that they saw something in my work that they felt was worth cultivating... I know for a fact that it is a much better play as a result of this process.” – Conor McShane, author of </i>The Letter G</p>
<p><i>“...their minimalist production was eye-opening. The presentation, the audience reaction, the comments afterward and the new perspective, everything. As a direct result of all this, I turned Companions into an audio drama, which I think is the best single work I've ever done... I'm convinced that none of this would have happened in the same way if not for Coffee &amp; Whiskey.” – Bob Koester, author of </i>Companions</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The risk is that you’ll make us cry. It doesn’t sound terrible now, but trust me when I say you don’t want to see that—it's all super weird ugly crying faces with us (especially Nic), just really  unsettling to witness. And if we don't reach our goal, then rest assured that WE WILL CRY IN FRONT OF YOU. WE WILL HAUNT YOUR DAYS. EVER PRESENT, ALWAYS WEEPING. Blind date? We’ll be at the next table, crying. Big job interview? Sobbing in the corner behind the hiring manager. In the shower? Your towel will already be damp with our tears. Does that sound fun to you? Of course not, you’re not a monster.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, your risk is basically zero. You get to help the arts flourish, we get to do what we love, and some deserving playwrights get the critical feedback they need to take the next step and hopefully win a Pulitzer or a Tony or something. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you can't contribute directly, you can still help us by getting the word out. Tell everyone you know about Coffee &amp; Whiskey and the work that we do, and let them know how to support it. Share it on Instagram, share it on Facebook, tweet that mess! Everything helps.</li>
<li>Next time you come to see a Coffee &amp; Whiskey show, bring two people along-- we'll thank you for it, and they might also!</li>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are a group of SMU Meadows School of the Arts Alumni who are ready to return to our roots and collaborate without distraction. We are coming from all over the U.S. to mount a minimally-produced, brisk cutting of Romeo and Juliet to be performed the last weekend in January/early February in an intimate space. We don't believe we need concept to make this play exciting or relevant, and w<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">e chose Romeo and Juliet for its lyricism, energy, comedy, and unbridled passion. When we last worked together, many of us </span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">weren't far from the ages of some of these characters; we knew each other as teenagers. Now, in our thirties, we're ready to dive in with experience, technique, and trust.</span> We hope this is the first of many collaborations. Emily Ernst, Joshua L. Peugh, and Christopher Rutherford with co-direct with original music by Ivan Dillard and Ian Ferguson.<br/><br/><u><strong>The Cast</strong></u><br/>The Prince/Paris - <strong>Alexander James MacAlpine</strong><br/>Benvolio - <strong>Scott Shomaker</strong><br/>Montague/Mercutio/Apothecary - <strong>Ian Ferguson</strong><br/>Romeo - <strong>Brandon Walker</strong><br/>Lady Capulet - <strong>Joan Korte</strong><br/>Lady Montague/Nurse - <strong>Jaquai Wade Pearson</strong><br/>Juliet - <strong>Emily Ernst</strong><br/>Tybalt - <strong>Flip Croft-Caderao</strong><br/>Capulet/Friar John - <strong>Michael Federico</strong><br/>Friar Lawrence/Peter - <strong>Christopher Rutherford </strong><br/><br/>Co-Director/Choreographer - <strong>Joshua L.

Peugh, and Christopher Rutherford </strong><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong> $8K will cover everything. </strong>This is half the average budget for scenery alone for the least-expensive Off-Broadway production. We are going absolute bare bones, with focus on the performances. We will fund most of our own travel and housing.</li>
<li>
<strong>90% of these funds go to pay our artists</strong>: two incredible, sought-after equity actors (Michael Federico and Ian Ferguson), eight equally talented non-equity actors (two of whom double as directors), a stage manager, and an internationally-renowned fight director (Sara Romersberger) and choreographer (Joshua L. Peugh). The rest covers our $500 liability insurance policy, some marketing, and a few essential costume pieces and props.</li>
<li>Inspired by the democratic work of <strong>Jacques Lecoq</strong> and <strong>Shakespeare's</strong> own company, Emily Ernst and Christopher Rutherford will co-direct with Founding Artistic Director of Dark Circles Contemporary Dance, Joshua L. Peugh. Ian Ferguson's original music completes this interdisciplinary collaboration.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, artists make less. The project will happen either way!<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<p><strong>We want to make Dallas a destination for the arts</strong>. Many of us have gone away to larger markets and want to bring what we learned back home. Your funds will help us come together for a month-long residency, where we can collaborate without distraction.</p>
<p><strong>We want to give back.</strong> We will donate everything beyond our budget in ticket sales to a Meadows scholarship set up by Katie Featherston (Paranormal Activity), who graduated in '05.</p>
<p><strong>We want to grow.</strong> We believe the ability to bring Shakespeare to the life is like going to the gym as an artist: it's an opportunity not only create work we love, but also to train as we focus on the voice, movement, and textual comprehension required to bring this muscular language to its full potential. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>The How</h3>
<p>As our movement Professor Bill Lengfelder put it: ""That you are even attempting the script without the trappings of traditional theater is absolutely like the existential, spontaneous, youthful, 'doing it all for love' that Romeo and Juliet is about."" We agree. And like Grotowski, we are deliberately limiting the size of our space: 99 people perf performance.</p>
<p>We've got experience, work ethic, and guts. We can do a lot with a little. We are prepared to mount a show at about a fourth of the budget typically required of a full-length production in our market. We have eliminated costs wherever possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deeply discounted space for rehearsals and performances</li>
<li>Donated housing (including by some of us!)</li>
<li>Actors who double as directors and designers</li>
<li>Very minimal costumes </li>
<li>No set </li>
<li>Small cast<br/> </li>

<p>My name is Vinny Stodder. I am a composer, lyricist, book writer, and arranger. I came to New York from Berklee College of Music in Boston to pursue my dream of creating and producing original Broadway musicals.</p>
<p>The Berkeley Dissolve is the original musical I have been writing for the past four years. It is ready for its first public presentation. </p>
<p>The Berkeley Dissolve tells three intertwining stories set in Berkeley, California in 1974: A disenchanted former Black Panther turned New Age therapist struggles to help a failing student escape the Unification Church. Two students are entrusted to be nannies for the Church of Satan’s head priest’s daughter. A former child actor’s struggles with heroin lead him to embrace the dawning Gay Rights movement. The characters are all products of a radical time and place where it was dangerously easy for young people searching for an identity to get lost on the way.</p>
<p>This is my first public presentation of the show, and it will be a concert reading with a live band and professional actors. </p>
</div><div>
<p>My hope is to raise $2800. This will help me pay my actors, my production team and band for the concert and assist with the costs of renting a venue and printing scores and scripts. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The hope is this concert reading will spark excitement for the show to grow and be seen by even larger audiences! </p>
<p>Your contribution will support this exciting new musical that pays tribute to the diverse and innovative music of the early seventies while telling the compelling stories of young people involved in the historic movements of this epochal time. The original score is a celebration of artist such as Crosby Stills and Nash, Joni Mitchell, The Who, Stevie Wonder, Elton John and David Bowie to name a few.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Berkeley Dissolve is a large, ambitious work that cannot be produced on a shoestring budget. It offers a fresh and exciting perspective that will appeal to a variety of audiences. It’s a show that promises to succeed on several levels- through music, historical context and the striking parallels between dream seekers of the seventies and the many who share those same hopes and quests for change today.</p>

We are so lucky to have artists graciously dedicated their time to us, and we think we should pay them for it.Here's What We're Thinking:We are trying to raise around 1,500 dollars. We know. That's a terrifying number. Here's where all this cash is going:Providing a stipend for our actors, director, stage manager, set designer, lighting technician, video, etc... Renting rehearsal space.Providing a reimbursement cushion for purchases made to better this production. The unknown financial burdens that will surely arise (because #livetheatre).It is SO IMPORTANT for artists to feel valued and appreciated for their work. That means paying them.The Future:Every cent we make here will go directly into the betterment of this production AND our small fledgeling company. Additionally, we are currently undertaking other exciting projects such as an EP, podcasts, short films, and more. The more we make here, the more we get to help future emerging artists! And with your help, we will be able to be a self-sufficient company, someday. We have a crap-ton of dreams about this, please help us achieve them! ""But What If You Don't Reach Your Goal?""We're learning. We're new. We don't know what the future holds. The good news is that we are relentless and passionate. We will make it work, no matter what is raised or not raised. That's what makes Somehow 9am Productions unique.Short On Personal Funds?Hey! That's okay! We get it and have been there (and are there right now!)! Here's how you can help us without spending money:SHARE! You never know who's out there. Sharing this page on Facebook, Instagram, via email, or however else you reach your masses is immensely helpful and super appreciated.Indiegogo has share features! This is a super-easy, one-click way that you can help. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts. It means the world to us. Love,Somehow 9am Productions (Mack and Emery)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Impact
Artists do it for love, right? However the cost of mounting a play is daunting. From renting rehearsal space and the venue, to buying wood to build the set to even securing the rights to produce the play - it all costs money.


Along with the actual play costs there is also the expense of promoting the play. Posters, newspaper ads, programs and radio spots let people know where and when the show is also cost a lot of money.This show is a co-op venture so all the actors are working without guarantee of pay, they are doing this because they love the project and this will help gain them experience and recognition.Artists do it for love - but with your help - they won't have to go into debt as well. Please help - even ten dollars will make a big difference.

<h3>The Translator's Dilemma Needs Funding</h3>
<p>As you can well imagine, it will take money to create our production and putting on a show at the fringe isn't cheap. The production team are working for free on the project but we would like to at least pay our director, actors and technicians for their travel expenses. As such, much of our budget will go towards those three weeks of rehearsal and three weeks of performances. The show won't have big sets, but we still need costumes, props, a projector and a screen. We also need to pay for marketing costs, such as printing flyers and posters. If we manage to make more than we need to put the show on, we'll be giving the rest to a Scottish asbestos charity.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Please note that we are performing at the Free Fringe, which means all tickets to our show are FREE. Consider just donating the price of a standard Fringe ticket, which is $17 (£10), which will go directly to our costs, instead of a box office or venue.</p>

The Play

The Translator's Dilemma is a one-hour drama designed to raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos and the plights of those suffering from asbestos-related illnesses in Scotland, Italy and around the world. Ottavia, a lecturer in translation
studies, is covering a class for a friend. When she opens the notes,
however, she realises the content is closer to home than she could
imagine. Can she give a lecture on asbestos without revealing her own
deadly secrets?


Inspired by the true story of
multinational asbestos executives who allowed the deaths of thousands
of Italians, this play explores the fallout of a killer mineral, and
its effect on a young woman's life. Performed in Italian and English,
by two actors and one overhead projector.




Performances
The show will be on as part of PBH's Free Fringe programme at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. We're in venue number 203 which is at Princes Mall (the shopping centre just next to Waverley train station) and the show runs from August 6-15 and 19-27th at 1pm. Tickets are free, which is one of the reasons that we are fundraising with IndieGoGo.


About Asbestos

<h3>
<br/>SkullDuggery Theatre is preparing to present its 26th Show, Bright Ideas by Eric Coble. In the tradition of SkullDuggery’s mission, Bright Ideas will be an Omaha premiere bringing fresh new theatre to its community. The performances will be produced in the heart of Downtown Benson (a suburb of Omaha) and a percentage of profits will go to benefit the restoration of the Benson Theatre.</h3>
<h3><strong>How far would you go for your child? For Genevra and Joshua Bradley, the question is no longer hypothetical. Their three-year old son, Mac, is next on the waiting list to get into the Bright Ideas Early Childhood Development Academy—and everyone knows once you’re in there, your life will unfold with glorious ease. Josh and Gen have had to scramble all their lives to get this far… and now they are one fatal dinner party away from the ultimate success as parents: The Right Pre-School. You may never look at pre-school—or pesto—the same way again.<br/><br/> In a world where job training starts at age 4, Bright Ideas explores the lengths parents will go for their children’s success. We all strive to provide the best opportunities, the best schools, the best life. But when fighting for perfection blurs the lines of morality and sanity, giving our children what’s best becomes our (and their) destruction instead. Knowledge is power, and like in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the obsession with power is corrupting. This show, although hyperbolic, can be the impetus for conversation about what it means to be a good parent.<br/> </strong></h3>
<h3>
<br/>In asking for donations, we are striving to cover the costs of costumes, props, advertising, rights to the show, and the effort to provide financial support to the local talent. Omaha has a diverse theatre community with a limited amount of paid professional opportunities. One of our goals is to provide that support consistently through our productions.</h3>
<p>Our production will be performing at the Pizza Shoppe Collective, a non-traditional performance space. It is home to many artistic events and our set, props, and dressings needs to be flexible around a consistently changing schedule. Flexibility extends within the production of Bright Ideas as there are 17 locations that need to be realized in the performance space. To make this happen and keep with the theme of the play, our pre-show design will utilize a makeshift backdrop and oversized children’s blocks in creative and colorful fashion. From Poisonous Pesto to Green Birthday cake, the prop list is fairly extensive. Similarly, there are over 17 characters played by only 5 actors within the show, each requiring a detailed costume that sets them apart and uniquely distinguishes each role. Additionally, the sound and light design will play a pivotal role in transforming the performance space. To see our vision come to life for Omaha audiences, your contribution is greatly needed.<br/>If do not reach our entire goal, we will use what we have to create the design of the show and the world will implode.</p>
<p>To develop the concept for Bright Ideas, we focused on three main elements: The inspiration that the script drew from Shakespeare’s Macbeth; the childish-ness of the main character’s actions; and the journey of these characters from the hum-drum to cataclysmic and catastrophic disaster. The play starts with a bare stage, just some blocks to create a non-descript locale (similar to Shakespeare’s Old Globe Theater). As the events tumble forward, the performance space becomes more and more colorful, diverse, and dynamic. What were only benches at the start become the world around the characters. Mirroring the building blocks of a preschooler, they start building up the world around them. In the end, those blocks <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span>come crashing down into a giant mess of balloons, streamers and emotion, as the world of these characters crashes down around them.</p>
<p><br/>SkullDuggery has successfully produced 25 shows, most of which have had critical acclaim and garnished several awards and nominations from The Theatre Arts Guild and Omaha Entertainment Awards. Our previous season had 2 shows listed as the best of Omaha Theatre from the Omaha World Herald with 2 additional shows that season being on the honorable mention list.

<p>To celebrate our fifth anniversary, the <a href=""http://bostonbookfest.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boston Book Festival</a>
wants to bring a taste of literature to people in settings where it is least
expected-- bars, pubs, cafes, and subway cars. 
Our goal with FlashLit is to surprise unsuspecting folks with a little
literary magic aiming to add some “re-enchantment” to everyday life. Partnering
with some of Boston’s hottest fringe theatre troupes, scenes will leap off the
page into a live performance in venues scattered throughout the city’s diverse
communities: from Central Square to Charlestown, Southie to the South End.  </p>
<h3><b>How
It Will Work</b></h3>
<p>The project will send a group of actors ""undercover""
during the five nights leading up to the Boston Book Festival, featuring a different
local theatre company each night (including <a href=""http://www.liarsandbelievers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Liars &amp; Believers</a>, <a href=""http://newexhibitionroom.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Exhibition Room</a>, <a href=""http://www.theatreonfire.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theatre on Fire</a>, and <a href=""http://vagabondtheatregroup.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vagabond Theatre Group</a>). At first, these actors will be indistinguishable from every other
person in the setting, casually sipping a drink and reading from a book. When
the actors begin to interact and raise their voices in a full-throated
delivery, the bar or subway car will find itself an involuntary host to a
famous moment from a novel or play. After a few minutes, the scene will end,
the actors will disperse, and things will return to normal. The play is done.
There will be no warning, no advertising, and few traces of the BBF to be found
once the actors leave, save for a couple copies of the book from which the
scene is taken and a BBF bookmark as a clue. The event will come and go like a
mirage. </p>
<h3><b>What
We Hope to Accomplish</b></h3>
<p>This project is truly meant to bring a piece of flash pop-up
theatre – a lightning-speed performance – out into the neighborhoods of Boston,
in familiar establishments frequented by locals. Whether the piece is vaguely
familiar to listeners or completely unfamiliar, we hope to leave people
thinking—and wondering. More than anything, we want to ignite a passion for
literature and the infinite possibilities which writers make possible through
their crafting of words. Will anyone figure out that the performance was
brought to them by the BBF?  Who knows.
That’s not really the point.  We want to
bring the magic of literature to people in their everyday lives.  </p>
<h3><b>Challenges
</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As with any theatrical performance, the actors risk being
pelted with rotten vegetables. Or, confronted with blank stares. But seeing how
people respond is an essential part of the project. This unanticipated live
performance will be made doubly interesting by the improvised and unpredictable
reactions from the “audience.” It requires performers who can perform a
literary adaptation while improvising with the surrounding crowd. By breaking
down the barrier between performer and spectator, however, the risky reactions
could turn into a great reward.</p>
<h3><b>Rewards
</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Bringing a performance into a non-traditional environment
means reaching an audience that may not frequently enter a bookstore or a
theatre. Setting these pop-up plays on a piece of the “home turf” provides the
Boston Book Festival and the theatre companies associated with the project a
chance to reach outside our traditional boundaries. This sense of discomfort
and spontaneity will add an extra, lively dimension to the performance. We hope
that by creating something unexpected and rare, viewers will have a memorable
experience that encourages a sense of ease when approaching literature and the
arts.</p>
<h3><b>Why
We Need Your Help</b></h3>
<p>In the performing arts, presenting ethically means paying
the artists involved in a piece. Keeping in mind that each piece will have a
director and multiple actors putting in rehearsal hours before their on-site
performance, your donation will enable us to pay a competitive stipend for the
theatre-makers involved in FlashLit. We also plan to purchase several copies of
each book from which we adapt a scene to leave behind at the performance site
for the extra-curious spectator to pick up and continue reading. </p>

<p>All great art seems to have a history or genesis in controversy.  “The First Book of the Bible” was  created by theatre majors Christian Haigis and Wesley Zurick for their senior project at the School for Creative and Performing Arts in Cincinnati, OH. Christian and Wes had long been riveted by the stories of the Old Testament and were excited to interpret the ancient tales with their brand of humor and biting wit. The musical, however, was banned by the school administration, despite support from parents, local community art organizations and several teachers. <em>The First Book of: The Bible, </em>even with age restrictions and warnings, was deemed inappropriate fare when <em>The Vagina Monologues </em>and <em>For Colored Girls </em>got the green light in past years.  Luckily, it was perfect fare for Cincinnati’s popular and progressive summer Fringe Festival. The premiere of <em>The First Book of: The Bible</em> was the first sold-out show of the 2011 Fringe and went on to win the coveted “Audience Pick of the Fringe” award .</p>
<p>Christian and Wesley followed up with a sequel, <em>Exodus,</em> in the summer of 2012 which thrilled well-attended audiences at the Monmouth Theatre company in Newport, Ky. Christian went on to film school at the University of Texas in Austin, TX, and Wesley started his 2<sup>nd</sup> year at the Atlantic Acting School in NY. They have reunited this summer to bring their original show to the Big Apple with another set of incredibly talented actors, actresses and musicians.</p>

<h3>About ""Daze of My Life""<br/>
</h3></span></span></span></span><p>""Daze of My Life"" is my first-ever written piece.  So not only do I get to perform in Theatre Row in NYC, but I also get to share my personal story with the audience.</p>
<p>I have been working on ""Daze of My Life"" for almost 2 years, and it was not easy.  ""Daze"" is a solo performance that shares experiences I have had throughout my life that shape who I am today and the way that I view myself.  It deals with important issues, such as self-image, sexual abuse, and adoption, along with sharing some of my Filipino culture.</p>
<p>I honestly didn't think my story was interesting or important.  I thought people would find it boring and self-centered.  But after my first performance for my solo class showcase, I got such a great response from the audience that I decided to take my piece to the Hollywood Fringe Festival.  I later applied and got accepted to perform ""Daze"" for the <a href=""http://www.lawtf.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LA Women's Theatre Festival</a> (LAWTF)!  It was such an amazing surprise, and the positive support for my show just kept stacking up.  I guess I was making a difference in people's lives because, to my amazement, so many people could relate to my story in some way!</p>
<p>This year, I wanted to challenge myself even more by applying to <a href=""http://fringenyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fringe NYC</a> - a world-renowned and highly competitive theatre festival -  so that I could join the other talented performers in the NYC spotlight and share my story.  But to no avail; I did not get accepted.  I was disheartened until I got a letter from them sharing their disappointment in not being able to fit me into this year's festival schedule.</p>
<p>Luckily, I had also applied to the <a href=""http://unitedsolo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">United Solo Theatre Festival</a> (USTF) in NYC - and got in!  My acceptance into the USTF reminded me to never lose faith in myself and to use rejection as a means of growing.  It also reinforces the importance of sharing one's story (not just mine).</p>
<p>Helping me to get my story out to the NYC audience is a stepping stone for not only me, but for everyone who wants to share their life experiences and art.  I want to spark people's creativity and courage, show them the possibilities of what they can do with their passions, and encourage them to step out of their comfort zones.</p>
<h3>What Your Support Does for ""Daze""<br/>
</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that New York City is an expensive place to visit, let alone live!  Aside from pursuing the performing arts (which, in case you didn't realize or forgot, does not pay much to most), I work two part-time jobs.  Unfortunately, after paying for the cost of living and student loans, it is hard to fund my trip on my own.  <b>Your supportive donations will help to pay for some of the festival fees and travel costs (flight, accommodations, in-city transportation, and food).</b><br/></p>
<p>Even though ""Daze of My Life"" is a solo performance, I did not work on it alone.  Without <a href=""http://debradeliso.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Debra De Liso</a>, ""Daze"" would probably never exist.  Debra taught me the art of solo performance and supported me every step of the way from the first day that I walked into her class two years ago up until now.  And she offered to help me with little to no monetary requests.  <b>I would love your help in providing Debra De Liso with as much compensation as I can for all of the time she put into helping me with this project.  If anything, I want to be able to pay for her travel costs</b> (because she is coming to NYC not only as my director, but also as my stage manager!).<br/></p>
<p>""Daze of My Life"" has been a constant work-in-progress.  The shows that I performed at the Hollywood Fringe and the LAWTF were shorter than the piece that I will perform in NYC.  I thought it would be a great idea to share the newer version of ""Daze"" with not only a NYC audience, but with people in LA - my hometown.  <b>A portion of the funds received will go towards the production of an LA show.</b><br/></p>
<p>I need a total of $2,500.  My goal for IndieGoGo is to raise at least $1,500.  In summary, all of the money will go towards paying for the following:<br/></p></span><span class=""notranlsate""><ul>
<li>United Solo Theatre Festival fees<br/>
</li>
<li>flight costs for my director (Debra De Liso) and me</li>
<li>publicity</li>
<li>transportation costs while in NYC</li>
<li>food during our NYC stay</li>
<li>accommodations</li>
<li>paying my director (Debra De Liso) for all of her hard work</li>
<li>producing an LA show of ""Daze of My Life""</li>
<li>paying IndieGoGo a percentage of the money raised<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details about Rewards<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>About the LA Show of ""Daze of My Life""<br/></b></p>
<p>Some of the rewards include tickets to an LA show.  My original plan was to produce and perform an LA performance of ""Daze of My Life"" before I leave for New York City.  I am waiting to hear back from a theatre to see if there are any available dates that work before my NYC show and will update this area to include the details.  If a show pre-NYC is not possible, then the LA show will happen after the NYC show.</p>
<p><b>About Karin Schneider Photography<br/></b></p>
<p>Karin Schneider is a long-time college friend.  The picture I am using to promote ""Daze of My Life"" was taken by her!  Being the generous and supportive friend that she is, she also offered her time to take pictures of people who donate $100 (see the $100 reward for details).  Check out her website: <a href=""http://www.schneider-photography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.schneider-photography.com</a><br/></p>

<h3>Who Are We? What Is This? </h3>
<p>Strange Bird Theatre Company is a freshly-hatched collective with an artistic commitment to work that highlights the myriad complexities of human relationships and tackles difficult themes to spark social dialogue. We seek texts that illuminate often-stigmatized social issues and, by bringing them to the forefront, combat their status as taboo or unapproachable. Strange Bird is therefore committed to diverse voices and representation as the truest reflection of human experience.

<p>This campaign represents a fundraising effort for our first mainstage production, going up this December 14-16th: Ruby Rae Spiegel's <i>Dry Land</i>.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All donations to this project will go directly towards our production costs, including but not limited to space rental, props, costumes, performance rights, set piece rental, and marketing. Our goal is set at $2,800, which aims to cover not only the aforementioned expenses, but also a bit extra for donation to Planned Parenthood of NYC! (As this play deals with themes of abortion, sexuality, and women's health, we feel it is critical to our mission of socially-conscious theatre to contribute to such non-profit organizations.) Our estimated costs stand at $,2000, at which point any remaining funds will be donated. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dry Land is a story exploring two teenage girls' choices about their lives and bodies at a time when women's stories, sexuality, and bodily autonomy are consistently degraded and devalued in our culture. Bringing their stories to life means not only the chance to provide meaningful, thoughtful entertainment for people, but to spark critical conversations and provide representation onstage that many of us do not get to witness in our everyday lives. We hope that everyone can find power in seeing a piece of themselves recognized in this play. </p>
<p>On a more long-term scale, your donations are also helping facilitate the launch of Strange Bird as a collective that hopes to exist for many years to come, continuing to produce conversation-sparking theatre and to give voice to diverse human experiences. This is a true grassroots endeavor, and it starts with the support and participation of audience members like yourselves! We want our projects to feel that they belong to everyone! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a theatre company is no easy task! <i>Dry Land</i> comes with the risks of any first production. Our cast and crew's diverse range of professions and career paths have presented time constraints. As we have no standing funding (yet!), the upfront costs have been high for us, but we are determined to raise that money and more, the difference to be donated to Planned Parenthood. Another challenge of being a newly-minted company is a limited capacity to market and advertise. We are building awareness and support from scratch, and your help is fundamental not only in covering practical costs, but in spreading the word for Strange Bird!</p>
<p>We plan to continue to fundraise through our performance dates in mid-December, and to seek funding from additional sources including small grant programs that are committed to new creative projects. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate, there are other great and simple ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about Strange Bird! If you identify with or are interested in our mission and story, please let your friends and loved ones know! Every listening ear helps, as does every Tweet, Facebook status, and Instagram post! </li>
<li>Talk loudly about us around the water cooler at work! On your Tinder dates! At Thanksgiving dinner around another strange bird!</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools! Click those buttons and send our fundraising link to as many people as you can!</li>
<li>COME TO THE SHOW!! BRING A WHOLE ENTOURAGE! This effort means little without audience members to witness it. Our production goes up at Shetler Studios in ""The Bridge"" at 244 West 54th Street, New York, NY. Show times are as follows: <ul>
<li>Friday, December 14 - 7pm</li>

Strange Bird Theatre Company is a freshly-hatched collective with an artistic commitment to work that highlights the myriad complexities of human relationships and tackles difficult themes to spark social dialogue.

Beginning first with <i>The Lesson</i> by Eugene Ionesco, followed by a pair of short plays by Anton Chekov <em>The Bear </em>and<em> The Proposal,</em> and concluding with Shakespeare's <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">THE PLAY </h2><p>In his essay ""Experience of the Theatre"", Eugene Ionesco claimed to have hated going to the theatre as a child because it gave him ""no pleasure or feeling of participation"". I share and acknowledge this criticism and strive instead to follow in his footsteps to tell stories that are physical, imaginative, gripping and connect with our audiences. Ionesco would later become known as the father of the Theatre of the Absurd and wrote a number of groundbreaking plays including The Lesson that are simultaneously hilarious, tragic, and profound. In The Lesson Ionesco bravely challenges conventional realism to deliver a play that is utterly gripping and edgy, a play that tantalises with colourful and musical language in a circular plot full of contradictions, ironies and comical constructs. Like Ionesco at Agni we seek to reveal stories that resonate with our common spirit, that boldly connect with our audiences, we share the desire for a distinctly physical and imaginative approach - this embodies the Agni ideal of the relationship between the actors and the audience. </p><p>For me Ionesco was a true artist and he wrote for humanity. Through <i>The Lesson</i> he wanted to awaken us to the meaninglessness of social conventions, the absurdity of bourgeois life  with it's dogmatic and repetitive mechanical nature.

<p><i>""The moment I ventured into Agni Acting Studio I felt at ease knowing that this was the space where the dream of becoming an actor becomes a reality. As an aspiring performer, I was overcome with fears, vulnerabilities and insecurities. Having completed my first term in the Stanislavski Foundational Course and the following live performance, I have gained more self- confidence, courage and belief as an actor and as an individual. The methodical approach that Hope and Tomas take challenges, encourages and guides you to being a greater actor. All the while they ensure that you remain truthful to the self, keeping the essence of individuality in each stage. It's a warm, homelike environment where you are wrapped in creativity, imagination and understanding, also a whole lot of fun! This atmosphere builds a trust between the fellow actors giving each other endless enthusiasm and support. I shall continue my journey at the Agni Acting Studio, knowing that I will discover more truth, inspiration and adventure that will stay with me forever.""</i> <br/></p>

<p><i>""I would just like to say that the Stanislavski Studio has been the best experience I have had as an actor...The positive energy and dedication of Hope and Tomas really inspires and motivates you to thrive on the stage and out in the world... It really boosts your confidence and imagination. I would recommend this course to anybody who is interested in acting, weather it be on screen or stage...I am 100% certain you will not regret it. I found that each class was holistic but intense in a positive way... Each class although a group lesson it is also like getting one to one coaching... I will be most definitely continuing my training at the Agni Acting Studio."" </i></p>

This atmosphere builds a trust between the fellow actors giving each other endless enthusiasm and support. I shall continue my journey at the Agni Acting Studio, knowing that I will discover more truth, inspiration and adventure that will stay with me forever."" 


- Lillian Harris, December 2013.
""I would just like to say that the Stanislavski Studio has been the best experience I have had as an actor...The positive energy and dedication of Hope and Tomas really inspires and motivates you to thrive on the stage and out in the world... It really boosts your confidence and imagination. I would recommend this course to anybody who is interested in acting, weather it be on screen or stage...I am 100% certain you will not regret it. I found that each class was holistic but intense in a positive way... Each class although a group lesson it is also like getting one to one coaching... I will be most definitely continuing my training at the Agni Acting Studio."" 
- Stephen Maguire. Proud student of The Agni Acting Studio

<h3>Happy Spring, friends &amp; supporters!</h3>
<p>As The Physical Plant enters its third year, I think about what we were able to create last year thanks to the support of so many.  Please enjoy the video of The Physical Plant's 2012 performances above-- our work is for you and because of you!</p>
<p>With a group of such talented, intelligent dancers, The Physical Plant has grown.  We've been pushing one another's performance boundaries and enjoying the creative process; embracing the unknown and allowing dances to breathe a life of its own. </p>
<p>We have already been working in the studio, <strong>expanding</strong> last year's <em>Currents</em> and <strong>planning new works with video and text, comedy and installation</strong>.  We have applied to several dance festivals and programs this season, and are waiting to hear back! </p>
<p>Please help bring our new works to life so The Physical Plant can flourish even more this year!  </p>

<h3>About The Physical Plant</h3>
<p class=""ecxmsonormal"">The Physical Plant is comprised of various collaborators where we develop the changing nuances of the mind-body connection.  We focus a technical eye on our instinctive movements, and study how intention drives us.  By manipulating this language, we grow from understanding how the body speaks while sharing our ideas with audiences to open a dialogue.</p>

<h3>Your Donations Work!</h3>
<p><strong>Months</strong> of creating, rehearsing, and production planning go on behind any single performance.  Ticket sales alone cannot off-set company costs even on a minimal budget.  Of utmost important to me is to be able to offer my dancers a stipend for their dedication and hard work-- without them, there is no medium for choreography. </p>
<p><strong>Our goal this year is to raise $2000.</strong>  Your donation <strong>directly helps fund</strong> all dancers' rehearsal and performance stipends, rehearsal space, and performance production costs.  If we cannot reach our fundraising goal, our dance works will have to be tabled and our momentum will be stalled until we find sufficient financial backing. </p>
<p><strong>When you donate, you get PERKS!  Choose from the PERKS tiers on the right!</strong></p>
<p> *Note:  <strong>Surpassing</strong> our fundraising goal allows our company to <strong>receive the full $2000 after service fees</strong>! *</p>
<h3>Why Donate (besides perks)?</h3>
<p>Your donations are the jumping off point for the dance company to build its own economy.  The dance industry relies majorly on private funding to keep offering art to the general public.  In the bigger picture, your donations bring opportunity to dancers, choreographers, and dance aficionados alike. We love what we do as dancers and believe in its societal value.  With your support, we can continue to work hard to make quality dance pieces that reach audiences.</p>

<p><strong><em>""Art is not a mirror held up to reality but a hammer with which to shape it.""</em>         </strong></p>
<p>-Bertolt Brecht</p>
<p>The Life of Jude is a play I am passionate about. Every time I picked up the script I said ""There is something here. This play is important.” I have worked on it for over ten years. I developed it through the Tarragon Theatre, The Shaw Festival, Theatre Passe Muraille, George Brown Theatre School and the National Theatre School of Canada. But none of those illustrious institutions are producing the play; I am, with my little company Falling Hammer at the Summerworks Theatre Festival - August 8-18, 2013. With 21 actors all working for free, this will be the largest show in Summerworks history.</p>
<p>We are seeking your support to help put this impressive show on stage and to put money into the pockets of the artists involved.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The play is a parable about a boy who thinks he's chosen by God and through the misapplication of his beliefs, ends up sowing tragedy all around him. It is also extremely funny, has a love story, explores theatrical form and features 21 performers on stage in an Epic Theatre style musical.</p>

<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>The Life of Jude is about militarism, corporatism, greed, faith and love. In a mountain town called Hope, long ago (and right now) Jude, a young boy loses his father and mother and is sent to a church seminary to provide him an education and vocation.</p>
<p>Jude’s questioning mind is controlled by a strict clergy who ply him with fundamentalist teachings, hardening his beliefs. Jude returns to Hope as a priest after finishing his studies. As he works to save the souls of his parish, his beliefs come into conflict with the world around him and his feeling for the woman he left behind.</p>
<p>I have been a playwright and actor for over 25 years and have had my work produced nationally and internationally and yet producing my own work is the most satisfying work of all. I wrote this play to explore greed, violence and religious fundamentalism, believing that all religions need to balance the human with the divine if there is to be peace and tolerance.  I feel privileged to be putting this play up in Summerworks with such a distinguished group.</p>
<p>My Co-Artistic Director Kelly Thornton and I have a stellar record producing several Dora nominated plays and attracting critical acclaim for our work. We are committed to producing this play in August 2013 and providing a compelling and powerful production. </p>
<p>The play features twelve of Toronto’s most explosive and accomplished actors, in the company of eight talented members of the 2013 graduating class of the National Theatre School and Bishop’s University along with my impressive six year old daughter.</p>

-Bertolt Brecht
The Life of Jude is a play I am passionate about. Every time I picked up the script I said ""There is something here. This play is important.” I have worked on it for over ten years. I developed it through the Tarragon Theatre, The Shaw Festival, Theatre Passe Muraille, George Brown Theatre School and the National Theatre School of Canada. But none of those illustrious institutions are producing the play; I am, with my little company Falling Hammer at the Summerworks Theatre Festival - August 8-18, 2013. With 21 actors all working for free, this will be the largest show in Summerworks history.
We are seeking your support to help put this impressive show on stage and to put money into the pockets of the artists involved.
The Challenge
The play is a parable about a boy who thinks he's chosen by God and through the misapplication of his beliefs, ends up sowing tragedy all around him. It is also extremely funny, has a love story, explores theatrical form and features 21 performers on stage in an Epic Theatre style musical.
This play is so large that most theatres cannot afford to produce it and yet we are  compelled to mount it amidst the two and three handers that make up most of our theatrical fare.
To produce this play ""normally"" with union fees and insurance based on 7 weeks work would be a minimum 150k budget. Havng a big dream play produced even with sold out houses for 7 performances at Summerworks means each artist will make only a modest remuneration for all their hard work.

<h2>The Plays</h2>
<p><em>Biloxi Blues</em> by Neil Simon</p>
<p>Winner of the 1985 Tony for Best Play</p>
<p><span>When we last met Eugene Jerome, he was coping with adolescence in 1930's Brooklyn. Here, he is a young army recruit during WW II, going through basic training and learning about Life and Love with a capital 'L' along with some harsher lessons, while stationed at boot camp in Biloxi, Mississippi in 1943.</span></p>
<p><em>Boeing Boeing</em> by Marc Carmoletti</p>
<p><span> This 1960's French farce adapted for the English-speaking stage features self-styled Parisian lothario Bernard, who has Italian, German, and American fiancees, each beautiful airline hostesses with frequent ""layovers"". He keeps ""one up, one down and one pending"" until unexpected schedule changes bring all three to Paris and Bernard's apartment at the same time</span></p>
<p><em>Rabbit Hole</em> by David Lindsay-Abaire</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize Winner 2007</p>
<p><span>Becca and Howie Corbett have everything a family could want, until a life-shattering accident turns their world upside down and leaves the couple drifting perilously apart.

<p><em>The Children's Hou</em>r by Lillian Hellman</p>
<p>A serious and adult play about two women who run a school for girls. After a malicious youngster starts a rumor about the two women, the rumor soon turns to scandal.

That magic is, in no small part, thanks to Benjie's risers.  </p>
<p>Having the ability to transform the space is a key to our success with audiences, but this process has historically taken countless days of building and moving heavy wooden platforms to accomplish and isn't sustainable moving forward.  </p>

<p>In order to keep this magic, but reduce the manpower, we need a metal riser system that would allow us to change over more easily and quickly, giving us greater capacity to use the space and cutting down on the hours it would take to do so.  The more flexible system would give artists, audiences and community members greater access and use of the Hall for many years to come.  It is a needed improvement and would be an excellent way to send Benjie off, feeling his job was finally completed.</p> </div> <div>
<div>
<p>Most riser systems are out of our budget, but we have recently received a quote of $20,000 for a new metal system that would provide us with greater flexibility and capacity.  <b>AND we have a generous donor who has offered a $10,000 match if we can raise the rest ourselves.  </b></p>
<p>Here's the catch: we need to make the move on this in the next week if we want to have these risers in place this year and make use of this match.  In order for us to make the big decision to move forward now, we need a show of support from YOU for about half of the match amount in record time.  <b>That's $5,000 this week, </b>and there are some cool perks attached for donors too.  Can we do it?  <i>Believe</i>, Sancho...</p>
</div>

<h3><b>You make a difference!</b></h3>

<p>Contributions start as low as $10, and yes, even that amount is important.  Just as important though is spreading the word- facebook us and email your friends.  Let's get some grass roots funding started and make art and community happen!  </p>

Most riser systems are out of our budget, but we have recently received a quote of $20,000 for a new metal system that would provide us with greater flexibility and capacity.  AND we have a generous donor who has offered a $10,000 match if we can raise the rest ourselves.  
Here's the catch: we need to make the move on this in the next week if we want to have these risers in place this year and make use of this match.  In order for us to make the big decision to move forward now, we need a show of support from YOU for about half of the match amount in record time.  That's $5,000 this week, and there are some cool perks attached for donors too.  Can we do it?  Believe, Sancho...


You make a difference!

Contributions start as low as $10, and yes, even that amount is important.  Just as important though is spreading the word- facebook us and email your friends.  Let's get some grass roots funding started and make art and community happen!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Theatre has always been a reflection of who we are as a society, a culture and a community, which is why there is a serious problem <strong>when only 20% of the perspectives and stories that are</strong> <strong>told are created by women</strong>.   Women purchase 70% of the tickets, they’re 60% of the audience and yet despite 50% of the play submissions to theatres being written by women, <strong>only 20% of the creative works that end up on the stage actually have female writers.</strong></p>
<p>The Los Angeles Theatre Project (LAWTP) was founded in 2007 as a 501 C3 nonprofit organization to create opportunities for gender equity in theatre and the Performing Arts.  <strong>We create educational opportunities and performances that represent women on a broader scale and meet the needs of our culture, mentoring young girls and providing support to women in all phases of their careers.  </strong>We support women in<strong> </strong>achieving their goals and their dreams through networking, referrals, productions, promotion and education. </p>

WOMEN?</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After meeting at the
Canberra School of Music (Jazz Studies), Karen Strahan and Jill Walsh have
independently collaborated, performed and co-produced successful cabaret
productions for the past 20 years. During this time they have been fortunate
enough to con some of Australia’s leading directors, musicians and vocalists to
jump on the creative bandwagon. “Hey guys!  We’ve got this great idea!!!!”</p><p>
</p><h3><b>WHEN IS THIS SHOW GOING ON?</b></h3>
<p>Overture, dim the lights,
this is it… the night of nights. <b>The 8<sup>th </sup>of May 2014 for a two-week
season.  </b></p>
<p>Closing night is the 18<sup>th</sup>
May 2014… and oh what heights we’ll hit… on with the show this is it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/302657/files/20140111080041-winging2013-724x1024.jpg?1389456041"" src="""" style=""width: 391.8704856787049px; height: 554px;""/></p><h3><b>WHERE IS THIS SHOW GOING ON AND HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?</b></h3><p><i>Winging My Way to the Top</i> will be seen for the very first time at The Q – Queanbeyan Performing Arts Centre NSW… just a little off Broadway.</p><p>In February 2012 two very nervous girls (GIRLS: Aust. A female from the age of infancy to the age of death) pitched their completely original show to the Program Manager/Artistic Director, Stephen Pike in the foyer of The Q Theatre. Yep, you guessed it, they wang it!  (WANG: Aust. past tense of winging.)</p><p></p>
<h3><b>WHAT WE NEED </b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We need you!  Help us raise $30,000 of the $120,000
needed to put the show on.  As
independent producers Strahan and Walsh have to finance theatre costs, musical
arrangements, musician fees, sound recording, set and lighting design and staff,
costumes, marketing, publicity and printing.</p>
<p>While we’ve been treading
the cabaret boards for many years we need you to step into the spotlight and
become a part of making <i>Winging My Way to
the Top </i>a smash hit!  Who
knows, Queanbeyan today, tomorrow Cobargo! </p>

<h3><b>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</b></h3>
<p>Comedy, escapism and a
bit of fun for starters.  We want
you to be a feather in the wings of this bird.  Help us get it off the ground. Award winning Director
Stephen Pike, plans to invite producers nationwide to the season in May 2014 to
help launch the musical nationally, so who knows where it
could end up and you can say to everyone – you were responsible for making it
happen.  You were there at the
crucial start when the show needed you most. </p>
<p>Check out the
tiering to see the varied and exciting rewards you can get. They range from
promotional material for the show, copies of the soundtrack, tickets to any
show and tickets to opening and closing night while they’re available
(including the all-important after party!), exclusive dinner with the cast and
private performances by four members of the cast (who make up vocal act The
Marvellous Mizdemeanours)! </p>

<blockquote>“Two
highly talented, wildly enthusiastic and very clever Canberra women are soon to
venture into new territory by producing Winging My Way to the Top. The new
musical is anticipated with relish. History demonstrates this will be another
successful venture undertaken by these two inventive ladies and I heartily
recommend supporting this project.” Ian
McLean AM, CSC 2013 (Theatre Musical Director who has conducted nearly 30
productions including Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera).</blockquote><blockquote>
<br/> “I am very impressed with Karen and Jill’s ability
to write funny, believable characters with which audiences immediately
identify. Winging My Way to the Top is a delightful extension of the writing
skills of these independent producers and an excellent piece of commercial
writing, offering strong potential to become a Broadway hit. I have no
hesitation recommending it.” Bill

<p></p></div>","Contribute this week to support International Women's Day!Fame was within
reach…until Pearl stole the show.
Winging My Way to the Top is about sibling rivalry, egos and a second chance
at the big time. 
This is a brand new
Australian musical comedy written by a couple of housewives from Canberra.  OK, admittedly one runs her own
business but you will be reassured to learn the other one is a chronic
underachiever. WHO ARE THESE
WOMEN?
After meeting at the
Canberra School of Music (Jazz Studies), Karen Strahan and Jill Walsh have
independently collaborated, performed and co-produced successful cabaret
productions for the past 20 years. During this time they have been fortunate
enough to con some of Australia’s leading directors, musicians and vocalists to
jump on the creative bandwagon. “Hey guys!  We’ve got this great idea!!!!”
WHEN IS THIS SHOW GOING ON?
Overture, dim the lights,
this is it… the night of nights. The 8th of May 2014 for a two-week
season.  
Closing night is the 18th
May 2014… and oh what heights we’ll hit… on with the show this is it.WHERE IS THIS SHOW GOING ON AND HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?Winging My Way to the Top will be seen for the very first time at The Q – Queanbeyan Performing Arts Centre NSW… just a little off Broadway.In February 2012 two very nervous girls (GIRLS: Aust. A female from the age of infancy to the age of death) pitched their completely original show to the Program Manager/Artistic Director, Stephen Pike in the foyer of The Q Theatre. Yep, you guessed it, they wang it!  (WANG: Aust. past tense of winging.)
WHAT WE NEED 
We need you!  Help us raise $30,000 of the $120,000
needed to put the show on.  As
independent producers Strahan and Walsh have to finance theatre costs, musical
arrangements, musician fees, sound recording, set and lighting design and staff,
costumes, marketing, publicity and printing.
While we’ve been treading
the cabaret boards for many years we need you to step into the spotlight and
become a part of making Winging My Way to
the Top a smash hit!  Who
knows, Queanbeyan today, tomorrow Cobargo! 

WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?
Comedy, escapism and a
bit of fun for starters.  We want
you to be a feather in the wings of this bird.  Help us get it off the ground. Award winning Director
Stephen Pike, plans to invite producers nationwide to the season in May 2014 to
help launch the musical nationally, so who knows where it
could end up and you can say to everyone – you were responsible for making it
happen.  You were there at the
crucial start when the show needed you most. 
Check out the
tiering to see the varied and exciting rewards you can get. They range from
promotional material for the show, copies of the soundtrack, tickets to any
show and tickets to opening and closing night while they’re available
(including the all-important after party!), exclusive dinner with the cast and
private performances by four members of the cast (who make up vocal act The
Marvellous Mizdemeanours)! 
AWARDS
AND GRANTS
Winging My Way to the Top
has just received an Arts ACT grant of:$34,452 to assist in staging
the production. We are very thankful to have the support of the ACT Government
and the recognition of Canberra based artists. 
In 2012, the
show also won: a Capital Arts Patron Organisation (CAPO) Macquarie Wealth Award
of $4,000, which will assist in the cost of the set design. 
ENDORSEMENTS
“Two
highly talented, wildly enthusiastic and very clever Canberra women are soon to
venture into new territory by producing Winging My Way to the Top. The new
musical is anticipated with relish. History demonstrates this will be another
successful venture undertaken by these two inventive ladies and I heartily
recommend supporting this project.” Ian
McLean AM, CSC 2013 (Theatre Musical Director who has conducted nearly 30
productions including Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera).
 “I am very impressed with Karen and Jill’s ability
to write funny, believable characters with which audiences immediately
identify. Winging My Way to the Top is a delightful extension of the writing
skills of these independent producers and an excellent piece of commercial
writing, offering strong potential to become a Broadway hit. I have no
hesitation recommending it.” Bill
Stephens Theatre Critic 2013

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Umeshi Rajeendra and I am a dance teacher and choreographer living in Sri Lanka. I have recently been accepted into the MFA Dance Program at The University of the Arts – which I’m very excited about.  This fundraiser is an appeal to you for help with my tuition fees so I can pursue this very valuable opportunity and help my students and the community in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p><strong>My Background </strong><br/><br/>To give you a brief background of my experience - I founded the Mesh Academy of Dance in Sri Lanka in 2015 after completing my BA at Denison University. To my surprise, the school took off and I have been able to transform the Sri Lankan dance industry more than I could have dreamed of. I trained dancers with little to no experience in dance to perform in four of my choreographed productions and have been a visiting lecturer at two of Sri Lanka’s top universities for performing arts, where I am helping to develop the contemporary dance program for undergraduate students. I have also been pushing the subject of reimagining dance in the public sphere in Sri Lanka and was a TEDx Speaker in 2015.<br/><br/>I have also kept my ties with the US, doing a collaborative project with Denison University over the past 3 years where dancers from both Denison and my academy do a two-week exchange program to get exposed to the different cultures and dance methodologies. Furthermore, I received a scholarship to attend the American Dance Festival as an International Choreographer in Residence where I presented my work in progress choreography in 2016.<br/><br/>For reviews of my work and more information on me, please click on below links:<br/><br/>1. <a href=""http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190421/magazine/left-with-a-whirlwind-of-emotions-346054.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190421/magazine/left-...</a><br/><br/>2. <a href=""http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170423/magazine/coming-out-of-the-shadows-art-redefined-237512.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170423/magazine/comin...</a><br/><br/>3. <a href=""http://www.life.lk/article/buzz_with_danu/Buzz-----With-Danu---Umeshi-Rajeendra/35/18661"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.life.lk/article/buzz_with_danu/Buzz-...</a><br/><br/>4. <a href=""https://roar.media/english/life/culture-identities/mesh-academy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://roar.media/english/life/culture-identit...</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I ask of your help to get me to the University of the Arts in September 2019</strong><br/><br/>I am passionate about using my creative voice to impact society and generating multiple ideas and solutions with an experimental approach. With the education provided at The University of the Arts, I can broaden and deepen my dance skills and refine my own craft so that I can continue to shape the dance community in Sri Lanka and challenge existing thinking.  The curriculum, which is grounded in critical inquiry and creative practice, will enable me to transcend artistic disciplines and forge partnerships with different artists locally and globally.<br/><br/>While I am eternally grateful to the university for offering me a scholarship of 80% toward my education, the $10,000 balance is preventing me from attending at this point in time due to the challenges I face in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka does not provide financial and social support for artists, and public and private scholarship opportunities are practically non-existent.  In addition, banks in Sri Lanka do not give loans to artists as it’s not a recognized industry. Unfortunately, as an artist, we do not earn much, and building up my school in the last 4 years means a majority of the fees goes back into the school for my student's development, therefore I am finding it difficult to find the means to make this happen. <br/><br/>I am aware that not every dancer has been afforded the opportunities that I have been so blessed with. I would like to restate my commitment to support aspiring young dancers by means of teaching, advice based on my own experience and also financially when I am able to do so.<br/><br/>As an emerging artist I have so much more to learn and discover. Having this opportunity to spend time side by side with prominent professors of Contemporary Dance will prove pivotal in extending my skills in choreography and teaching, to help my dancers in Sri Lanka develop their own art, more attuned to the global context. Therefore, I am kindly requesting you to help me so that I can pursue my MFA and continue to give back to my country and give my students a better dance education. The MFA in Dance at the University of the Arts is one of the best programs out there and it would be a privilege for me to attend and eventually, establish a long term partnership. <br/><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>If any of the above resonates with you please help me! Any donation is helpful, and also feel free to contact me. $10,000 go directly towards my tuition fees. I am doing several workshops in Sri Lanka to raise funds for my airfare, accommodation, and meals, therefore this campaign is purely for my tuition. </p>
<p>I understand that not everyone is able to help support me financially, so if you can’t, I would hugely appreciate it if you shared my page with your friends and family on social media/emails/word of mouth. I will be sure to update you regularly on my progress throughout next year’s study.  </p>
<p><strong>Impact </strong></p>
<p>I believe the Master of Fine Arts in Dance at the University of Arts is the perfect institution that will cultivate my inspired identity and spirited-groundwork from the past few years, in an environment that will serve to broaden my skills through exposure to current creative practices and research in choreography. This next phase of my creative pursuits will provide the injection that my students and the community at large in Sri Lanka needs to propel the momentum I have created in the last few years in my motherland. This will help me establish stronger programs in high schools and in the University. This will also help me establish a long term partnership whereby my students are able to go and experience training firsthand internationally. </p>
<p>Other than my endless gratitude I can offer every single skill or thing I have acquired so far.<br/>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

</p><p>THE TRIP invites you to join our group therapy session.
Bitter coffee, cheap orange juice, and day-old cookies will be provided. Mac doesn’t want to engage this way, in this compulsive act of stealing someone’s
life. He’d rather be bird-watching. But he can’t help himself. From within the
safety of a theatrical twelve-step meeting, THE TRIP invites you to experience
Shakespeare’s MACBETH in a way you’ve never imagined it.</p>
<p>After the unsuccessful attempt to raise the amount of money
required for a very ambitious adaptation of Ernest Hemingway’s “The Snows of
Kilimanjaro,” THE TRIP is back with a more modestly budgeted and conceived
production. We will be making this show for practically nothing. It will be a
shoestring budget, a labor of love. We are making this show to share it with
the world, to continue to support our collaborators, and to follow through with
the promise to our backers to make the kind of theater that only THE TRIP makes.
Joshua Brody, Carissa Cash, Claire Kaplan, and Thomas Miller will all still be
featured in the piece and it will be directed by Tom Dugdale.</p>
<p>The
 total cost of the show will be a little over $5000. We have pledged 
$1400 out of our own pockets—the absolute maximum we can spare—and we 
are hoping for your help with the remaining $3600.  We have tightened 
the budget everywhere we can.  Our actors have agreed to a significant 
reduction in pay, and we will be working for free.  But we cannot avoid 
the cost of space rental, insurance, and a few indispensable design 
elements (like seating for our audience!).  These are the areas where 
your contribution will be applied.</p><p>As always, you can support us in three ways:</p><p>1. DONATE HERE! Every dollar counts and we need a few of them.</p><p>2. SPREAD THE WORD!

UPDATE: We have reached our funding goal!! Thank you so, so very much to all of you who already donated! A few expenses in the project have turned out to be a little more than we expected, so we're going to keep trying to raise money on here until the time runs out! Rest assured, every dollar goes directly into production costs. We have signed the rental agreement with the space. And as exciting as that is (and trust us, it IS!), it also required that a lot of spending happen before we ever collected the money from this campaign. So we're hoping to continue to go, go, go above and beyond the goal in an effort to defray the costs. Thank you so much again, and help us continue to spread the word!<p></p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Writing you from the air on my way from San Diego to Germany. I'm traveling a day (and staying just two) to see my favorite company in the world, NEEDCOMPANY. Several years ago while still a student, I saw an epic production of theirs that was and still is the greatest thing I have ever seen. It changed my life.</p>
<p>Why share this? Only to say: This is theater. In some special circumstances, when the right group of people are gathered in the right place, something can be made which hooks us and keeps us hooked, so much so that we save for months to fly half-way around the world to see it live. Despite all our technologies, it's still that group of earnest Ernies right in front of us in Frankfurt or San Diego singing a goofy song (if it's one of my shows) which moves us in the way the say: We are here in this moment, and it's a good moment. </p>
<p>We hope with this next show and all we do that we are a good moment for you, and we can't thank you enough for your support. You are helping us come together. And if you want to get on a plane and join us, you better believe we'll be waiting here with a big hug... and a big show.</p>

<p><b><i>God's Ear </i>by Jenny Schwartz is an imaginative play about the grieving process that breaks the boundaries of theatre</b>.  It floats in a spaceless, timeless atmosphere of loss.The story follows a family in the aftermath of the tragic drowning of their son. The characters try their hardest to reach out to one another, but socially prescribed behaviors and language, meant to help them, never quite do. Though not entirely set in reality, the play is honest and genuine in its exploration of grief. The show will be a movement driven experience in the Caplan Studio Theater at the University of the Arts, April 22nd-30th. </p>
<p>As artists, we are always looking for the highest amount of creativity and opportunity for ourselves in our work. <b>This play tests the boundaries of language, movement, and design</b>: it is a thrilling challenge for all of our collaborators. <i>God's Ear</i> dives into an exploration of grief  through its frustrating, hilarious, and devastating qualities.  It is a voice to express our inner struggles with social prescriptions for behavior.<b>The show provides an exciting opportunity for us to build a unique theatrical experience, interactive installation, and art gallery</b>.</p>
<p>Recently, our community at the University of the Arts experienced a loss on our campus.  It was during the time director, Shira Berger, lost two other people within the span of three consecutive weeks. <i>God's Ear </i> suddenly became incredibly relevant to her personally and to the community around her.  The play depicts grief as abstract and ever changing as it is in reality. <b>Students need a way to talk about grief without being told how to do it ""right"" or how to ""move on"" quickly</b>. Shira chose this play as her Senior Thesis and quickly developed ways to extend it past herself and into her community. </p>
<p></p>
<p> Our team has paired up with other artists at the University of the Arts to compile a Grief Gallery throughout the rehearsal process of the play. The gallery features visual artwork created on the subject of grief and loss. <b>The Grief Gallery is open to any student that wants to contribute work </b>and its curators hold  open art-therapy sessions on various Monday nights until the opening of <i>God's Ear</i>.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
God's Ear by Jenny Schwartz is an imaginative play about the grieving process that breaks the boundaries of theatre.  It floats in a spaceless, timeless atmosphere of loss.The story follows a family in the aftermath of the tragic drowning of their son. The characters try their hardest to reach out to one another, but socially prescribed behaviors and language, meant to help them, never quite do. Though not entirely set in reality, the play is honest and genuine in its exploration of grief. The show will be a movement driven experience in the Caplan Studio Theater at the University of the Arts, April 22nd-30th. 
As artists, we are always looking for the highest amount of creativity and opportunity for ourselves in our work. This play tests the boundaries of language, movement, and design: it is a thrilling challenge for all of our collaborators. God's Ear dives into an exploration of grief  through its frustrating, hilarious, and devastating qualities.  It is a voice to express our inner struggles with social prescriptions for behavior.The show provides an exciting opportunity for us to build a unique theatrical experience, interactive installation, and art gallery.
Recently, our community at the University of the Arts experienced a loss on our campus.  It was during the time director, Shira Berger, lost two other people within the span of three consecutive weeks. God's Ear  suddenly became incredibly relevant to her personally and to the community around her.  The play depicts grief as abstract and ever changing as it is in reality. Students need a way to talk about grief without being told how to do it ""right"" or how to ""move on"" quickly. Shira chose this play as her Senior Thesis and quickly developed ways to extend it past herself and into her community. 

 Our team has paired up with other artists at the University of the Arts to compile a Grief Gallery throughout the rehearsal process of the play. The gallery features visual artwork created on the subject of grief and loss. The Grief Gallery is open to any student that wants to contribute work and its curators hold  open art-therapy sessions on various Monday nights until the opening of God's Ear.

<h3>About the Creator of <i>SPROUTED!</i>
</h3>
<p>Nachi Lederer is an actor, singer, dancer, and playwright. He studies Theatre and Dance at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, PA. He has spent this past year working on various productions at the Black Box Performing Arts Center, where he performs and teaches, and has been teaching Drama at the Thomas Jefferson Middle School in Teaneck, NJ. </p>
<p>During his studies and work in children’s theatre, Nachi realized the tremendous impact shows can have on kids. One of Nachi’s dreams is to create shows that the whole family can enjoy, while telling a meaningful story that teaches life lessons and espouses positive values. <i>SPROUTED!</i> is the first of Nachi's works to do just that.  </p>
<h3>What's It About?</h3>
<p>In the story of <i>SPROUTED!</i>, Jack is challenged to make the right decisions in complicated circumstances.  We learn, through Jack, that it's best to take a step back, analyze the situation, and then come up with a plan that would best benefit us and the people around us. But as events in life often do, things don't always turn out the way we plan.  It's important for children to learn how to make the best choice possible, when the line between right and wrong seems unclear. </p>
<p>With lively songs and witty dialogue, <i>SPROUTED!</i> is a musical comedy that the whole family can enjoy. And with your generosity, <i>SPROUTED!</i> can bud and bloom miraculously! </p>
<h3>How Your Contribution Makes a Difference</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are having our first run of the show at the Black Box Performing Arts Center this summer, but we need your help. In order to cover the initial production expenses, including sets, costumes, props, lighting equipment, sound design, marketing, and additional personnel we are hoping to raise $4,500. We have wonderful perks to offer our generous donors; rewards include seasonal tickets, invitations to all <i>SPROUTED! </i>events, advertising space in our show programs, specially reserved seating to <i>SPROUTED! </i>performances, and more! The production will be truly magical if we meet our goal. However, if we are met with the unfortunate circumstance of not reaching our goal, we will put the funds we have acquired toward constructing the sets, creating the costumes and props, setting the lights, promoting the show, and forming the best cast, creative team, and 3-piece orchestra we can. <i>SPROUTED!</i> will soar through the sky!</p>
<p>BBPAC's last professional show for kids, <i>Junie B. Jones The Musical</i>, was a major success, with full houses at every performance. And this summer, <i>SPROUTED! </i>is sure to be a huge hit! Your advertisement in our show's program will be seen by everyone who comes to see <i>SPROUTED!</i> And if you advertise in our lobby, by becoming a ""Bounteous Beanstalk Backer,"" everyone who sets foot into our theater will see your advertisement.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't make a donation at this time, there are a number of ways you can assist in the process of getting this show up on its feet. You can share our campaign on social media platforms, reach out to anyone you think may be interested in supporting <i>SPROUTED!</i>, or reach out to Nachi via email (nachiled@gmail.com) to see what you can do to help!</p>

<h3>About the Play</h3>
<p>Upon first reading of this play, we were completely hooked. ""Time Stands Still"" focuses on Sarah and James, a photojournalist and a foreign correspondent trying to find happiness in a world that seems to have gone crazy. (Sound familiar? #MAGA) Theirs is a partnership based on telling the toughest stories, and together, making a difference. But when their own story takes a sudden turn while covering the Syrian conflict, the adventurous couple confronts the prospect of a more conventional life.</p>
<p>While exploring the place and importance of wartime journalism in the world, Sarah and James face a struggle that most everyone in present day America can relate to-- the balance between their responsibility to the cause, and their responsibility to each other and their life at home. By telling this story, we hope to ask these questions of our audience, and begin a larger dialogue about how we can achieve balance in our own lives, while still helping others.</p>

<h3>NEVER SWIM ALONE</h3>
<p>Play Synopsis: <i>Never Swim Alone</i> is a swift, ferocious satire about two Alpha-Males and their ruthless competition to be crowned the winner. Frank and Bill, two men in dark suits and bad ties, square off in a thirteen-round battle royale of vicious insults and desperate one-upmanship in a bid to win the love of the Referee, a mysterious woman who controls the game and its competitors in a world where the only option is to be the first, and nothing is as it seems. Written by award-winning Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor in 1991 and never performed professionally in the UK, <i>Never Swim Alone</i> experiments with form to present a haunting interrogation into perceptions of masculinity, egotism and how trauma shapes who we are.</p>
<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>We are Forge Collective, a new theatre collective committed to staging new writing and reviving contemporary plays. We like finding hidden gems and bringing them to the fore, which is exactly what we want to achieve with our debut show – Never Swim Alone.</p>
<p>We performed <i>Never Swim Alone</i> back in October 2016 at the Caryl Churchill Theatre to a string of sold-out audiences. Now, we want to bring it back, making it better than ever – but we’re going to need your help. Creating a show can be an expensive venture and we need some help to cover a few essential costs. Any support you can give will play a vital role in ensuring we can realise the full potential of this show and, as a company, keep bringing you the hidden gems of theatre for a little while longer. </p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED AND WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO </h3>
<p>Putting on a show in London comes with some costs. While we are seeking funding from various sources, we still need some help! The <strong>£1000</strong> we hope to raise through this campaign will play an invaluable role in the completion of <i>Never Swim Alone</i>. </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of where the money will go:</p>
<p><strong>PAYING OUR ARTISTS</strong><br/>Alongside our fantastic cast and crew, we have hired some Photographers and a Sound Designer to help bring Never Swim Alone to life. £330 of the money raised will go towards making sure we can pay these artists the fee they deserve. After all, the show wouldn't be the same without their amazing work!</p>
<p><strong>MARKETING</strong><br/>With London being the UK's largest hub for theatre, we have a lot of competition and as an emerging company, it's important to stand out and get people interested in the show! Our marketing includes getting flyers and posters designed and printed, as well as enough programmes to cover our 6-night run. We also need to create online promotional content. This includes Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, email communications and website fees. £290 of the money raised will go towards our marketing costs, ensuring people know who we are and what we're creating.</p>
<p><strong>SET DESIGN</strong><br/>Our set is extremely minimal. However, our vision includes special flooring which will take our design to the next level. £100 of the money raised will go towards buying enough flooring to cover our stage space.</p>
<p><strong>COSTUMES</strong><br/>Frank and Bill are men that look good and dress well. Or at least they think they do. Although their ties are bad and their suits bright, dressing our characters is no easy venture. £180 of the money raised will go towards making sure Frank, Bill and the Referee are fully dressed and looking as suave as can be.</p>
<p><strong>PROPS</strong><br/>This technical production requires a list of very specific props, many of which require making from scratch. £100 of the money raised will go towards buying the props and materials we need to bring the show to life. </p>
<p>This money is only the beginning, so anything more will go back into the project to help cover the many other costs that come with bringing <i>Never Swim Alone</i> to London. </p>

</div></div>","NEVER SWIM ALONE
Play Synopsis: Never Swim Alone is a swift, ferocious satire about two Alpha-Males and their ruthless competition to be crowned the winner. Frank and Bill, two men in dark suits and bad ties, square off in a thirteen-round battle royale of vicious insults and desperate one-upmanship in a bid to win the love of the Referee, a mysterious woman who controls the game and its competitors in a world where the only option is to be the first, and nothing is as it seems. Written by award-winning Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor in 1991 and never performed professionally in the UK, Never Swim Alone experiments with form to present a haunting interrogation into perceptions of masculinity, egotism and how trauma shapes who we are.
WHO WE ARE
We are Forge Collective, a new theatre collective committed to staging new writing and reviving contemporary plays. We like finding hidden gems and bringing them to the fore, which is exactly what we want to achieve with our debut show – Never Swim Alone.
We performed Never Swim Alone back in October 2016 at the Caryl Churchill Theatre to a string of sold-out audiences. Now, we want to bring it back, making it better than ever – but we’re going to need your help. Creating a show can be an expensive venture and we need some help to cover a few essential costs. Any support you can give will play a vital role in ensuring we can realise the full potential of this show and, as a company, keep bringing you the hidden gems of theatre for a little while longer.

Tabatha is currently in her third and final year studying English and Drama at Royal Holloway University of London. She has performed in many different productions whilst at the university and is also a performer for Wrong Shoe Theatre Company. She is excited to revive her performance as the Referee in Never Swim Alone.

Jack is making his London theatre debut having performed in a number of shows throughout Surrey and Kent. This year he graduated with a BA in English and Drama from Royal Holloway University of London. He recently appeared in the sell-out run of Holy Sh*t with Brick Fox Theatre as Father Charlie Moss. And he is thrilled to be back working in such a complex and rich show with this wonderful company.
ALEXANDER HICK - ARTISTIC DIRECTOR 

Alexander Hick is a freelance theatre director. He is currently working as a Trainee Resident Director at the King's Head Theatre. His previous work includes the ★★★★★ An Abundance of Tims (Bread and Roses Theatre, Tristan Bates Theatre, King's Head Theatre, Edinburgh Fringe).
BLUEY LITTLE - MARKETING MANAGER

Bluey Little is a recent Drama and Theatre Studies graduate from Royal Holloway. She has produced and marketed numerous student productions and recently assisted with the publicity for Shepard Tone’s An Abundance of Tims. She is ecstatic to be involved with Forge Collective and this incredible production.
SAXON ROSE MUDGE - PRODUCER

Saxon is a freelance Producer based in London. Having recently graduated from Royal Holloway University with a BA in English and Drama, she has produced a number of shows and recently completed a producing residency with The Wardrobe Ensemble in collaboration with The North Wall Arts Centre. She is thrilled to be working with Forge Collective on such a fantastic show.

WHAT WE NEED AND WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO 
Putting on a show in London comes with some costs. While we are seeking funding from various sources, we still need some help! The £1000 we hope to raise through this campaign will play an invaluable role in the completion of Never Swim Alone. 
Here is a breakdown of where the money will go:
PAYING OUR ARTISTSAlongside our fantastic cast and crew, we have hired some Photographers and a Sound Designer to help bring Never Swim Alone to life. £330 of the money raised will go towards making sure we can pay these artists the fee they deserve. After all, the show wouldn't be the same without their amazing work!
MARKETINGWith London being the UK's largest hub for theatre, we have a lot of competition and as an emerging company, it's important to stand out and get people interested in the show! Our marketing includes getting flyers and posters designed and printed, as well as enough programmes to cover our 6-night run. We also need to create online promotional content. This includes Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, email communications and website fees. £290 of the money raised will go towards our marketing costs, ensuring people know who we are and what we're creating.
SET DESIGNOur set is extremely minimal. However, our vision includes special flooring which will take our design to the next level. £100 of the money raised will go towards buying enough flooring to cover our stage space.
COSTUMESFrank and Bill are men that look good and dress well. Or at least they think they do. Although their ties are bad and their suits bright, dressing our characters is no easy venture. £180 of the money raised will go towards making sure Frank, Bill and the Referee are fully dressed and looking as suave as can be.
PROPSThis technical production requires a list of very specific props, many of which require making from scratch. £100 of the money raised will go towards buying the props and materials we need to bring the show to life. 
This money is only the beginning, so anything more will go back into the project to help cover the many other costs that come with bringing Never Swim Alone to London.

Jane Aquilina (Dustine) Songbird, Scribe and Funnylady, Jane Aquilina, (affectionately known as “Miss Jane”), a native San Franciscan, transplanted herself to the city that never sleeps to shake it up on the East Coast. She self-produced and wrote a one-woman semi-autobiographical, demi-tassed cabaret entitled “Bawdy n’ Soul” that was performed at The Metropolitan Room and has been been gracing the New York stages for the last decade performing and producing stand-up shows at Laugh Lounge, Caroline’s, Gotham and The Duplex.  Also, with a handful of cabaret performances under her belt as an honorary member of HonKbarK Theatre Company as well as a new member of Bizarre Noir Theatre Company, she enjoys taking current and old standards and adding a blues, funk or Brechtian twist.  She’s shared the stage with such musical luminaries as Myron Dove (Santana), Benny Rietveld (Miles Davis, Santana), Rubens de la Cortes (Angelique Kidjo, Eriana Erias), Nanny Assis, Mike Zilber and Manu Koch. Back home, she was a founding member of SketchMarks, an all-girl gender-bending sketch troupe and played an array of characters from Andy Warhol to Santa Claus.  One original character, Carmelita Alameda de las Pulgas, was inspiration for a two-woman show, “The C n’ C Cuban Factory:  We’re Here, We’re Cuban, Get Used to It” – it sold out some houses, busted some guts and made a few bucks. Jane will be playing Louella Parsons in Bizarre Noir Theatre Company's version of ""Cat's Meow"" in April!

<p>I am a composer and pianist passionate about the theatre, who loves to create new works that bring thoughtful entertainment, enlightenment, illusion and soul-searching moments  to the stage with my music. Together with my script and lyric writing colleague Kai Cofer, we have a sum of over 70 years in the professional theatre world, having shared our artistry with audiences from New York to Maui, from Seattle to Los Angeles, as well as Europe. We have ceaselessly given from our hearts and minds and the depths of souls to the community, despite the most challenging circumstances at times -- and we are now humbly asking that the community give back by helping us produce our latest work, ""I, Caligula, An Insanity Musical"", a contemporary yet timeless musical that parodies dictatorship. We believe that you will find our work humorous, profound, lyrical, delightful, thought-provoking, as apropos of the events of today as much as of two thousand years ago! By making a contribution at whatever level you feel moved to share, you are supporting writers, actors and fellow philanthropists by keeping stage alive - an art form that has always reflected humanity at its best and its worst, even in hard economic times.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have been investing every last dime of our own personal funds to mount this production, and we need your help. Our small production company is blessed with the amazing talent, devotion and experience of a ""dream"" cast and creative team -- we have all the elements for this show to be a huge success, and move on to larger venues in the future. Our choreographer and actors have created and played on major stages around the globe and here in Los Angeles area. Playing in a small theatre has both advantages and disadvantages - ticket sales will certainly help, but it must also be a labor of love for the common good. We are asking for $5,000 to help ensure that all our obligations to the cast, crew and theatre are met, and that our investors (at 0% interest rate, thank you!) are reimbursed. We have made plans to professionally video-tape and photograph the show and produce a DVD that can be sold, additionally benefitting the cast, stipends as well as any remaining expenses still owed. The ""perks"" listing is still in the early stage -- plans are in place, for example to provide custom pieces of art, sculpture and paintings that will be shown in the lobby -- but the most important reward for you is that of supporting live theatre and original works!

Frances and Marybeth
by Neale Kimmel
Directed by Heather Keith

Two sisters. Three men. Fourteen litres of milk. One ultimate date night.
A modern dilemma. A classic comedy of errors.

Frances has just had a
life moment. What's a life moment? She's not entirely sure, but she
is determined to drag herself off the couch, forget about her
cheating ex-fiance and throw the ultimate date night. And, she's
dragging her younger sister Marybeth, an artist who sells her paint
by numbers on Craigslist, along for the ride. With the handsome
Spanish man Frances picks up at the grocery store, and Marybeth's
Craigslist boyfriend due to arrive any minute, an unexpected party
crasher makes the evening a little more colourful than they had
expected.

An
outrageous comedy about love, moustaches and picking up the pieces,
Frances and Marybeth are two sisters learning that sometimes to get
it right, you have to paint outside the lines.

The show will run from March 8th to the 18th, 2012 in Factory Theatre's Studio Space in Toronto.

Featuring; Jesse Bond*, Carolyn Hall, Meaghen Quinn, David Ross* and Matt Wells.

<h3>On May 26, 2012 the world lost one os it's brightest stars, Maceo Davis.</h3>
<p>Maceo Davis possessed true grace. He touched the hearts of every person he ever met. He brought light to a world and made people feel as if he were their best friend.</p>
<p>Maceo loved people, he loved life and he loved theater. To entertain was his passion. But more than all of these things, Maceo loved to help people. Helping by making someone feel loved or by encouraging someone to achieve their dream. It seems as if the purpose of Maceo's time on earth was to spread love and make people feel special.</p>
<p>In June of 2012, Sheila McClure and David Lollar contacted Michelle Guerrero and Eric Tolley to ask for their help in starting a production company that would keep the memory of Maceo alive by bringing the joy of theater to the masses. Michelle and Eric agreed to join them and The Dream Factory was born. But The Dream Factory is not just a production company.</p>
<p>The goal of each Dream Factory Production is to raise a substantial amount of money to provide scholarships in Maceo's name for High School Seniors persuing a degree in the theatre arts.</p>
<p><strong>A NOTE FROM THE DIRECTOR:</strong></p>
<p>In the fall of 2008, as I was fighting valley fever, trying to finish my thesis production, and figuring out how to handle being a new mommy to my 6-month old baby boy, Althea Williams called me and invited me out to dinner. Looking back, I laugh realizing how gullible I was. Here I was thinking my friend was just trying to get me out of the house, not thinking for a second she had an ulterior motive. A BCT board member A WOMAN CALLED TRUTH for this inaugural production (I’m not sure if it was Julie Jordan Scott or Althea who selected the play, but I digress). After trying to get me drunk, she told me about the idea and that, in no uncertain terms, I needed to direct the show, that I was the only person who could. It took a lot of arm-twisting, but between her and my husband, I agreed to do it. I’m eternally grateful they convinced me.</p>
<p>I had done KISS ME, KATE with Maceo and had seen him in numerous other productions, and told him he was the most under-utilized and under-appreciated actor in town. I didn’t have any huge roles for him in the production, but I knew I had to work with him again. I must have called him twenty times before we finally made contact. It took a lot of arm-twisting, but between my begging and flexibility of rehearsal schedule, he agreed to do it. I’m eternal grateful I convinced him.</p>
<p>During the production of TRUTH, I saw A RAISIN IN THE SUN immediately called Althea. I told her BCT had to do that show for next year’s Black History Month production. Of course she agreed. I then told Maceo he had to play my Walter Lee. Of course, he agreed, too. And once again, I’m eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Then came August Wilson’s GEM OF THE OCEAN, and once again, a year in advance, I told Althea and Maceo we had to do this show. Once again, they agreed. And once again, I’m eternally grateful. And while working on GEM, I looked at Maceo and said, “you should play Frank in ROCKY.” You know what I’m going to say next…so, yeah.</p>
<p>I fought Althea on A WOMAN CALLED TRUTH. I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t want to work on a show that, according the to description on the back cover of the script, was a “youth” show. I didn’t understand why my husband, who loathes giving up his free time more than getting a root canal and had less experience with babies than power tools, would gladly offer to spend 2 to 4 hours every evening for two months with our infant son while I was in rehearsal. I know now it was Divine Intervention. It was the Hand of God. It was an incredible blessing. And I am eternally grateful.</p>
<p>I could go on and on about Maceo’s amazing performances: his tender portrayal of Sojourner Truth’s lover, Bob, who is forced to give up Sojourner because of slavery; the power and yearning of his Walter Lee, fighting against a society that defers his dreams; his incredible combination of strength and vulnerability as Citizen Barlowe, a young man who has convicted himself of murder and can only cleanse his soul by “visiting” his ancestors and reconciling with his victim; how he made us laugh as the over-the-top Frank and made us cry when he sang “I’m Going Home.” I could go on for hours about all of the incredible performances we’ve all seen him do over the years. And I’m not exaggerating. I really could! One of my favorite things in life is watching a talented actor move an audience, and Maceo was one of my favorites. (A funny story—Maceo &amp; I would text each other through “So You Think You Can Dance” and “American Idol” and share our colorful thoughts on each performance…so, so, so fun…I’m eternally grateful for those memories…but I digress…)</p>
<p>Although Maceo was crazy talented and SUCH a blessing to work with from a director’s standpoint, that’s not what I miss most about my friend and that’s not what I take from the brief time we had him here with us. More than anything else, I miss his spirit and I miss his heart. The reason he was able to play those powerful and amazing people so well is because he was powerful and amazing. He was strong and vulnerable and funny and moving and wise and yearning and loving…and he brought out the best in all of us.</p>
<p>I miss my friend. But I know, like Walter Lee, he’s moved to another place where he’s fulfilling some dreams he wasn’t able to fulfill here. I know, like Citizen Barlowe, he’s being celebrated by his ancestors. And I know, just as Sojourner Truth’s mother told her and as she told her children when they were torn apart long before they were ready to be parted…I know that when I look up at the stars, he’s there…putting on some freakin’ incredible shows.</p>
<p>And I’m eternally grateful.</p>

Ethikos Productions is thrilled to present our inaugural production ""Israel Horovitz One-Acts: It's Called the Sugar Plum/Beirut Rocks"" at the Flea Theater, July 5th - 15th. ""Israel Horovitz One-Acts"" is comprised of exciting, young NYC-based artists from backgrounds as varied as Harvard, Rutgers, the William Esper Studio, and Life 101. Our common aim? To produce an excellent night of theater.</p>
<p>Together, “Sugar Plum” and “Beirut Rocks,” mark a unique pairing of Horovitz’s work, recommended by the playwright himself. This combination is also being produced in Paris, France at the same time this year! “Sugar Plum” creates a time capsule of the late 1950’s, a sweet farce, that turns grief into a love story. “Beirut Rocks” is a shocking study in the shattering events of the Hezbollah air raids in Beirut in 2006. We plan to put these short plays side by side, for an evening of bold theatrical work across generations.</p>
<p>Ethikos Productions is a non-profit production company that sprung from a connection that yours truly, Brian and Jenna, found in the classroom at William Esper Studio. “Israel Horovitz One-Acts,” has all our energy, all our focus, and is our great teacher as we put up our very first production.  </p>
<p>This production marks the moment to take our art to new professional heights. We will be performing at the well-known and respected venue, The Flea Theater (<a href=""http://www.theflea.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theflea.org</a>). The Flea represents the quintessential off-Broadway experience of taking risks and exploring gutsy works, new and classic. As a maverick production company, we value having our performances at a venue that truly fosters artistic integrity. Israel Horovitz, the celebrated playwright of both one-acts, will be collaborating with us on our project. Additionally, Mia Walker, currently Assistant Director of Broadway’s ""The Gershwins Porgy and Bess,"" and former Resident Director at the Flea, will be directing both one-acts. We have an experienced technical team dedicated to enhancing the work of our talented actors.</p>

<p>On May 30th 2012, I became the recipient of the third annual Santa Aloi Award, presented by the Dance Centre.</p>
<p>The award is designed to help choreographers stage new work. Valued at $4,500, the money is provided to assist with Dancer Salaries. The award opened up a huge opportunity for myself aswell as for the community. After careful consideration and months of brainstorming, I am proud to say I have created a new full length Tap Dance show, entitled, Love.Be.Best.Free.  My show will be presented by the Scotia Bank Dance Centre this fall.</p>
<p>A full length show featuring Tap Dance is an ambituous project and needs outside funding to get on its feet. It is important to me to have an appropriate wood floor and live music. Part of the project has evolved into myself collaborating with  Andrea Superstien and Sharon Minemoto, in creating a few new scores for the show. There are also costuming, lighting design, set and other production costs. There have been far too many shows that have been under reheased and under funded. I want this show to be able to live past this debut presentation. I was this show to have legs, live and breath on future generations.</p>
<p>I am asking for your help to help my vision come to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Love.Be.Best.Free, is in a crucial time of it development. For the first time in a long time, audiences will be able to sit and enjoy a story told through tap dance, but I need your help.</p>
<p><br/>We need at minimum, $6000. Every dollar helps. In recognition of your support, certain ""perks"" have been made available. With everything form of recognition, I will do my best to let you know how much you all mean to me. Words cannot express how much your help and assistance will mean to me. Through regular video updates, I hope to keep everyone in the loop, making my project, our project.</p>
<h3><strong>The Show</strong></h3>
<p>How far will we lose ourselves to find love with someone else?  <em>LOVE.BE.BEST.FREE</em> follows the life of a free spririted artistic man who falls for his counter part, a materilaistic woman (played by singer Andrea Superstein). Blinded by love, he seeks to join the corporate workforce to buy the affection of his new lover. Successful in attaining his goal, we begin to see his happiness unravel as he becomes merely a puppet to his lover and the routine of day to day life. Will he find the strength to set himself free? An electrifying all-male cast comprising Ryan Foley, Shay Kuebler, Johnathan Morin and Nielsen himself tells a story for our times through tap, with live music by singer/song writer Andrea Superstein and pianist Sharon Minemoto.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>“Fair is foul, and foul is fair”</i></p>
<p>We are no longer in the Scottish Isles. We’ve traveled far into the distant future underneath the earth’s surface; where amongst a network of underground tunnels lies an inhospitable wasteland. After hearing the prophecy from three witch-like mole women, a seed engulfed with power and greed imbeds itself within Macbeth's mind, prompting an uncertain and mostly likely deadly future.  </p>

<p><i>If Any Productions </i>is a Production Company excited and eager to make their debut with this thrilling  production of Macbeth. With the team being made up of recent graduates, we are calling on the artistic community to help get our first production up and running! Most of our expenses translate to our most immediate need: Rehearsal Space. In order to put on the best possible show, our team needs the support to fund usable and affordable rehearsal space. </p>

“Fair is foul, and foul is fair”
We are no longer in the Scottish Isles. We’ve traveled far into the distant future underneath the earth’s surface; where amongst a network of underground tunnels lies an inhospitable wasteland. After hearing the prophecy from three witch-like mole women, a seed engulfed with power and greed imbeds itself within Macbeth's mind, prompting an uncertain and mostly likely deadly future.

What We Need & What You Get

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If Any Productions is a Production Company excited and eager to make their debut with this thrilling  production of Macbeth. With the team being made up of recent graduates, we are calling on the artistic community to help get our first production up and running! Most of our expenses translate to our most immediate need: Rehearsal Space. In order to put on the best possible show, our team needs the support to fund usable and affordable rehearsal space. 
In addition to rehearsal space, our second largest budgetary concern is stipends for our amazing cast and crew. With the production being made up of 15(+) individuals, our goal as professional theater artists, is being able to reward our team members for their hard work. 
The remaining funds will be used for food, costumes, admin and because we're working with a minimal set, props! 
Now we're asking for all of this, but don't forget, you benefit as well! We've got some amazing perks ranging from the fun to complete VIP access about the production. Once you've contributed to If Any Productions you're an official team member! This means you'll get updates and insights not only on our most recent production, but future productions as well.
The Impact
Young artists, especially those who have just completed their education, are in the midst of establishing themselves and creating their first mark in the artistic community. In order to do so, they need our support so that they have the opportunity to succeed. 
This production of Macbeth is not only showcasing the play in a new light, but is also stretching the boundaries of your typical  production of the Scottish Play. Not only are we working with a minimal set, but through complex choreography and staging we are bringing this underground world to life with the use of flashlights and costume.

Impact Of Shakespeare's Briefs

Relief
You can't take a night off from being sick or healing. We provide hospital patients, retirement home and hospice clients a distraction from their healing and transitional processes. We also empower clients by using clown-tactics in our interactive scenes, giving them with a sense of control in their environment. 

Accessibility


While most hospitals have recreational programs, accessibility is always an issue, and the amount of interaction patients or clients can receive in these programs is constantly fluctuating. 
We provide scenes, monologues, and choral pieces for one-on-one performances and interactions by performing in three mediums: Private Room Format, Open-Space Format, and Staged Format. This maintains program accessibility in all types of facilities.
By making the interactions more accessible, we are making the content more accessible. The works of William Shakespeare were written to be performed. Unfortunately, this context has been lost, so the humanity of the characters and the text are often lost. Bringing the content of William Shakespeare's plays on its feet revives that humanity and expression, making the characters and story more exciting and relatable.

Opportunity
We also provide opportunities for emerging artists. We believe in cyclical benefit solutions: Emerging artists need to perform, and Toronto communities have many needs that can be satisfied by incorporating performance opportunities. Why not use one to satisfy the other by simply sharing what we know?



What We Need
The purpose of this campaign is to cultivate roughly one half of funding for our entire budget.

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>LeTabby Lexington and Coco Lala of Send in the Girls Burlesque in Edmonton, bring their theatrical burlesque experience to the show.  Last summer, they appeared as Catherine of Aragon and Kitty Howard in Tudor Queens: A Burlesque at the 2011 Edmonton Fringe.  Tudor Queens sold out it's entire run, including holdovers, received 5 stars and won the first ever Staff Pick of the Fringe Award. </p>
<p>The evening will feature April O'Peel, from Vancouver. This comic cutie has titillated audiences in dozens of venues across Vancouver and Canada.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The writing of CRY LOVE began in Scotland in 2015. Mostly autobiographical, based on childhood memories and the ongoing struggle of living in an imaginary world or accepting reality, the writing turned into a tangible piece of theatre through a workshop at Pearl Studios in 2016. I am so excited to say that it is now ready to be produced on the Hudson Guild Theater stage in NYC for the NYSummerfest on September 11, 15 &amp; 16, 2018!</p>
<p>CRY LOVE is in need of your support! Please help us fund our musicians, cast and crew for the run of this show. As a theatre and music teacher/director for the past 30 years, I made it clear to my students that following your dreams, your creative passions, was not a waste of time.</p>
<p>Sharing the CRY LOVE music, the story, with an audience, is my dream. I could not do this without the support and love from my friends, family and community.</p> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>Why record <i>The Moon and the Sea</i>?</h3>
<p>I am as proud of <i><strong>The Moon and the Sea</strong></i> as anything I've ever created.  The musical tells the story of Erin and Charlie, two musicians whose impossible love is mirrored by the Moon and the Sea.  In the staged version of this show, all the music will be played by the actors; to get there, director <strong><a href=""http://www.david-alpert.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">David Alpert</a></strong> and I need to present producers and theaters with the full realization of these songs.</p>
<p>It's been so exciting to get to workshop this show with <a href=""http://creightonirons.com/The_Moon_and_the_Sea.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">some of the most incredible performers NYC has to offer</a>.  This recording will feature <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/officialhannahelless/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Hannah Elless</strong></a> (Bright Star),<strong> <a href=""http://www.katiethompson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Katie Thompson</a></strong> (Giant, so many other shows), <a href=""http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/news/Britton-Smith/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Britton Smith</strong></a> (Shuffle Along), <strong><a href=""http://www.aaronlavigne.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aaron Lavigne</a> </strong>(Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark), and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiUzGVttqnw"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Patrick Newton</strong></a> (Blue Man Group), along with an awesome band (<a href=""http://www.mmm.edu/live/profiles/381-damien-bassman"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Damien Bassman</strong></a> and<strong> <a href=""http://www.sethbarden.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seth Barden</a></strong>).  I'll sing a little, too, and play the piano.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because this score is almost all acoustic, it's important for us to record in a great ""live"" space with a real piano.  We've booked two days at <a href=""http://virtueandvicestudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virtue and Vice Studios</a> in Brooklyn, NY, with the eminent <a href=""http://www.tjgallo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rocky Gallo</a> engineering.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474686680/icyy8rsdotheaefdicyc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These songs won't be available for sale after this--only to stream online.  Those who donate $25 or more get automatic downloads of the entire album; $50 and up gets a physical, signed CD (and downloads).  The rest of the goodies are in the ""perks"" column to the right.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, I'm intent on making this happen.  With your help, hopefully I won't go broke along the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Great demos land productions, awards, and other workshop opportunities. When Sean Mahoney and I started out with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FACTORY-GIRLS-35654048341/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Factory Girls</i></a>, the demos really sold the show, taking it to Goodspeed, NAMT, Boston Conservatory, and others.  Those who have heard <i>The Moon and the Sea</i> in person have given me the encouragement I need to extend our audience by recording the songs--I'm excited to see where professional demos take this one. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As a musical theater writer who makes his living leading kids' choruses in the Bronx and coaching cross country, I am well aware that not all of us have the means to donate money.  If you're in that boat and still want to help there are a couple things we really need.  </p>

<p>1) Pass the link around--who knows when someone might really connect with the show?</p>
<p>2) Send any encouraging words... It is really scary and uncomfortable to ask people for money!</p>

<p>I want to shout out the many people that have been involved in this project thus far.  Blake Whyte (who just had a baby!), Cedric Neal (moved to UK!) and Isaac Woofter (writing screenplays!) are featured in the above video; the list of artists who have helped grow this piece through workshops and ""living room demos"" is too long for this page, but their names are <a href=""http://creightonirons.com/The_Moon_and_the_Sea.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

The plan is to make this a very exciting day for the community to gather together in the name of Indian dance, arts education, community development, and springtime fun.<br/><br/><strong> For Spring Fest to succeed with its big goals, we need significant funding support</strong>, and so I earnestly request that you consider backing this initiative.

2012 marks the beginning of a new phase in development and growth for Soham Dance Space. This year I am aiming to build a dynamic team of volunteers, staff, and board members who will dedicate themselves to working for this trailblazing organization. By September, I intend to formally incorporate Soham Dance Space as a not-for-profit and celebrate our 5th anniversary with special festivities and performances. In doing so, I seek to make significant strides in 2012 towards my long-term goals through expanded programming, greater presence in the community, and setting a new precedent for what to expect from Soham Dance Space in years to come. 
The upcoming ""Spring Fest"" on May 6th will serve as a launch pad for this ambitious agenda. It will feature an Open House, a festive event educating the public about our organization, and the Student Recital, a program for our students/families to connect with each other and celebrate the progress of the year. The plan is to make this a very exciting day for the community to gather together in the name of Indian dance, arts education, community development, and springtime fun. For Spring Fest to succeed with its big goals, we need significant funding support, and so I earnestly request that you consider backing this initiative. The purpose of the Spring Fest Fund, which will require $9,000 in funding, is to pool the practical resources necessary to cover the costs of holding this purposeful event. By making a tax-deductible donation to the Spring Fest Fund, you will help to propel Soham Dance Space forward so that it may serve the student body and wider community in more enriching and meaningful ways.
100% of your tax-deductible contribution would help to cover the cost of the following items:

Venue Rental (Theater + Burnside Hall), Parking Lot Rental
Costume Tailoring, Fabric, Accessories, Inventory
Marketing
Food, Refreshments
Live Music at Open House
Recording/Editing of Original Music by Renowned Composers for Anjal Chande's Performance
Banner, Signage, Decor
Video Documentation, Editing, Release
Award Certificates & Flowers
Miscellaneous Event Materials
If we miraculously surpass our funding needs for this event, surplus contributions will go towards:

Incorporating as not-for-profit 501c3 org - filing and legal fees
Board development workshops (by Chicago Foundation for Women and Arts & Business Council)
5th Year anniversary programs in September
Facility improvements at Soham Dance Space

Soham Dance Space has been gaining momentum behind the scenes, and I feel very optimistic and excited about galvanizing the community around this new endeavor, of which I hope you will be an integral part. Thank you so much for your support and positive energy! 

Let's make BIG things happen!

 Nel 2012 cade il 40mo anniversario della morte di una delle personalita' piu' importanti del secolo scorso: Dino Buzzati, il Kafka Italiano. Per celebrare questo artista, KIT porta a New York 4 delle sue donne: Irma, Iris, Velia, Luisa.
Sono appassionate, orgogliose, innamorate, ironiche e un po' folli, intrappolate nelle loro rispettive vite. Queste donne rappresentano la nostra passione, amore e follia per il teatro, per la letteratura e per la CULTURA ITALIANA.

E allora siate APPASSIONATI, INNAMORATI E FOLLI per il teatro con e come noi... DATE ALLE DONNE L'ULTIMO SLANCIO per ottenere tutto: affitto del teatro, promozione, scenografia.
E' questione di TUTTO o NIENTE. Le donne vogliono TUTTO.
Grazie!  KIT (Laura, Donatella, Janine e...)",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<br/><p></p><h3>About ELECTRIC COMPANY THEATRE</h3><p>Electric Company Theatre is a leading force in the Canadian theatre scene: creating original work rich in spectacle and adventurous in form, strong in narrative and reaching a diverse and growing audience. The company was originally formed as a collective in 1996 by Siminovitch Prize-winning director Kim Collier, David Hudgins, Jonathon Young and Governor General’s Award-winning writer Kevin Kerr, who met while training at Vancouver’s Studio 58. Their common respect for physical theatre, spectacle, adventurous narrative, new technology and visual art inspired the creation of their first show and the company that followed. The company’s methodology has evolved but the creative process remains highly collaborative; blurring traditional boundaries between playwright, director, dramaturgy and design. </p><p>With a growing body of work, Electric Company has created nineteen mainstage productions, toured eight times (Canada, USA, Scotland), written two screenplays, and won the first Alcan Performing Arts Award for Theatre (2001) in addition to multiple theatre awards across the country. <br/></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>""Jonathon Young is radiant.  This guy always looks like he's lit from within."" – <b>Georgia Straight</b></i></p><p><i>""It's no exaggeration to say that Young moves with the grace and precision of Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton.""</i> – <b>Georgia Straight</b></p><p><b></b></p><br/><p></p></div>","Kidd Pivot & Electric Company Theatre = Magic.

About ELECTRIC COMPANY THEATREElectric Company Theatre is a leading force in the Canadian theatre scene: creating original work rich in spectacle and adventurous in form, strong in narrative and reaching a diverse and growing audience. The company was originally formed as a collective in 1996 by Siminovitch Prize-winning director Kim Collier, David Hudgins, Jonathon Young and Governor General’s Award-winning writer Kevin Kerr, who met while training at Vancouver’s Studio 58. Their common respect for physical theatre, spectacle, adventurous narrative, new technology and visual art inspired the creation of their first show and the company that followed. The company’s methodology has evolved but the creative process remains highly collaborative; blurring traditional boundaries between playwright, director, dramaturgy and design. With a growing body of work, Electric Company has created nineteen mainstage productions, toured eight times (Canada, USA, Scotland), written two screenplays, and won the first Alcan Performing Arts Award for Theatre (2001) in addition to multiple theatre awards across the country. ""Jonathon Young is radiant.  This guy always looks like he's lit from within."" – Georgia Straight""It's no exaggeration to say that Young moves with the grace and precision of Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton."" – Georgia Straight",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Throughout time, humans have been motivated by fear of eternal suffering and damnation through many iterations of this torturous neverland. Throughout these depictions, the movement has been at the forefront of these images within movies, texts, and paintings.  We see convulsing bodies, contorted spines, necks moving in the delight of rapture, and ritualistic ceremony represented by swaying bodies. The body represents a playground for the devil and movement being his game. </p>
<p>C-LS has been in the creative process of their latest evening-length experimental performance, HELL, for over a year. In addition to the performance, C-LS has been in the process of creating a separate screen dance film under the same title. Club Shamoun is an interdisciplinary performance art company that works with artists across all mediums, including film, dance, theatre, music, and visual, to create innovatively thought-provoking works. HELL is set to premiere by Winter 2022, and the film release and live premiere in the Fall of 2022. In addition to choreographic direction by Lydia Shamoun, Hell will include live music by Ruby Dunphy, Visuals by Sierra Hendrix. The film is under the direction of Lydia Shamoun, Sierra Hendrix, and Allison Burke. </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Club Shamoun is an independent company, with most of the funding coming from the Artistic Director directly. There are several items we will need financial assistance to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>NYC Venue Fees</li>
<li>Lighting Rentals</li>
<li>Artists Fees</li>
<li>Travel Costs for out of state artists</li>
<li>Production Studio Rental</li>
<li>Camera and Lighting Rental</li>
<li>Film Editing Residency </li>
<li>Rehearsal Space</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>C-LS is a small, independent company led by a woman of color who recognizes a lack of finances due to wealth disparity. Over the last 4 years, Club Shamoun has been dedicated to creating accessible, inclusive performances and creative workshops nationwide. We have always offered low-cost or zero-cost options for performances and workshops because we believe performance and art education isn’t a privilege - it’s a right. Performance breeds community, and we want everyone to have the ability to be part of that community. </p>
<p>By funding this work, you are not only “giving us money for fees,” you are actually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing us low cost/no cost ticket options</li>
<li>Supporting BIPOC woman-led dance companies</li>
<li>Becoming part of a community that values art over profit</li>
<li>Recognizing the lack of resources for BIPOC artists and are actively countering that through a personal donation</li>
</ul>
