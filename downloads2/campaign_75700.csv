<p>The travel version is helping to have the game at a low cost and could help to reach other continents such as Africa, Europe and Asia.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is lack of products concerning African culture and history. Most of the teaching on Africa are directed to 7th during the month of February. One country only is chosen and is representing the whole continent.</p>
<p>Most of the people will judge you by what they know about you, the least you know the least you trust.

<p>This game will help also some who have challenges in world history and Geography and build bridges for a better world.</p>

<p><strong> Who we are…</strong></p>
<p>We are <strong>Cause 4 Design,</strong> a San Diego based company with years of experience in the apparel design, embellishing and fulfillment industry. </p>
<p>Our Mission is to provide a creative outlet for graphic artists who wish to expose their talents to a global audience by offering printed apparel ultimately benefitting charities and causes around the world.</p>
<p>Our goal is to bring together consumers and graphic artists wishing to contribute to global and local charities and causes by providing exclusive limited edition designs on a variety of apparel products.</p>
<p>We envision being the ultimate marketplace for consumers wishing to purchase fashionably printed apparel products while supporting global and local charities and causes.</p>
<p><strong>Our Story…</strong></p>
<p>Cause 4 Design is a concept that has been years in the making and when launched will benefit charities all over the world as well as putting some extra cash in the wallets of so many talented freelance artists that need a place to expose their talents. Together we can all make some incredible fashionable apparel with the goal of helping make a difference in the world. With a fully functioning production facility and fulfillment house Cause 4 Design is positioned to provide a platform that continues to give to causes while finding ways to help artists move their careers forward and feel good about who is benefitting from their creations. This is truly what we call a community business idea as those contributing the art benefit, those producing and fulfilling the product benefit, those purchasing the product benefit and charities around the world benefit.  The charities can be global, national, regional or they can be neighborhood causes as long as they are legitimate, legal and verifiable.</p>
<p>People will never stop buying T-shirts or fashionable apparel. Graphic artists always need outlets for their designs to be seen by a buying public and charities will always need a source of funding so they can continue to do good in the community. Help us meet those goals by contributing what you can so that we may build a platform that allows us to help. This is a win-win-win venture. With our apparel, printing, production and fulfillment experience and so many talented artists in the world we can create a marketplace of wonderful pieces that will surely become your favorite piece of clothing knowing that a portion of the sale price went to a cause you are all passionate about supporting.</p>
<p><strong>What your contribution does…</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us cover the coding and development costs that go into creating a site like the one we envision. A website that will feature the apparel, the artist and the charity being supported. The site will allow the artist to track the sales of their specific designs, show consumers how many of the limited edition designs are still available and provide information on the artist and the charity. In addition your contribution will help cover the maintenance and the initial marketing of the site.</p>
<p>The Artists are out there, the production facility is in place and there are many consumers waiting to purchase these cool new exclusive designs. All we need now is place for them all to gather. </p>
<p>We intend to become the preeminent location for those who want to ""Create to Contribute”. The more we create the more we will be able to contribute!</p>

<div><span class=""notranslate""> </span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate"">Back in January, I left my home to help out a family who asked for my assistance.  Upon arriving back home i found a horrific mess.  My home was burglarized, ransacked and vandalized.  Paper was everywhere.  I called the police only for them make me feel guilty for having ever left my home as if it were my own fault.  And it's not the first time.  It's been an ongoing occurrence after the first.  Because upon seeing the video, you'll see that it was major structural damage done.  They initially came throught the wall.  and upon me closing up that hole, the next time because of that weakness they ripped out the framework of the window and gained access that way. <br/></span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate""> </span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate"">It's been an uphill battle.  There are many who wish for me to commit insurance fraud as a way or means to fix all that was damaged.  But for me that's not an option.  It will only make things worst.  And one wrong doesn't begat another wrong to happen. <br/></span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate""> </span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate""><strong>WHAT THEY STOLE</strong><br/></span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate"">You think you've heard it all?  Well let me tell you what they stole.  On the first burglary they took the larger and smaller appliances which were on the first floor, from things like freezers to microwaves, toasters, and mixers.  I'm a pastry chef, and they stole ALL of my equipment for that.  They took all of my pots, pans, mixing bowls, flatware, utensils, and baking pans of all shapes and types.  <br/></span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate"">These thieves stole my plumbing, fixtures, electrical wiring, the conduit and electrical sockets straight out of the wall.  they stole the stereo and speakers, the sewage line, space heaters, two portable radios, an electric generator, a brand new flashlight, work lights, a single window pane from the living room, a single window pane from the back room, the bars from the window, the grates and burners from the stove, the racks from the stove, camping equipment, 3 luggage carts, three shopping carts, industrial bungee cords from home depot, all the money from my coin jars, the cords from all the surge protectors, three industrial extension cords, a pair of work boots, power drill, and driver sets, two tool boxes, and a brand new case of Scotts extra soft toilet paper.  i kid you not.  smh. <br/></span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate"">Second go run, these thieves stole the motors from my washers and dryer, the motor from the furnace,three 3 packs of dial soap, my multipack of coast, zest and caress, several bottles of ultra dawn, ultra joy, and ultra palmolive dishwashing liquid, several bottles of shampoo, two gallons of bleach, clorox cleanup toilet bowl cleaner, 24 small cans of campbell's pork and beans, a case of progresso soup, ragu pasta sauce, hellman's mayo, a bottle of windex, the remaining extension cords, and three USED trash bags.  smh.  I mean they actually dumped the trash out of the bags onto the floor and took the trash bags with them. smh.<br/></span></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate"">Next time they took three hammers and trashed the place.  There wasn't much left to take.  And in the interim, the new clothes I had purchased, they damaged by pouring cooking oil on them as well as all over my shoes rendering me with nothing but the clothes on my back and the shoes on my feet.  All that i had with me, was what i kept.  smh.  With what was done i was shocked that people would even steal what they took.  And i have a feeling there's still stuff that i'm forgetting.  They trashed my house more than once.  smh.  Every time i cleaned, I'd have to go back and clean again.  smh.<br/></span></div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you've read this far, you understand why I need what I need.  Cause this is a lot to replace and fix.</p>
I need a lot more than what I'm asking for.  Because essentially I have to rebuild my house from the ground up with all that has happened.  Most important are the structural issues.  What i've done so far is only temporary. </div>
<div>I'm asking for 25K as a means to fix the basics; from that exterior wall which is now hanging to replacing the plumbing, electrical, and heating.  That's as basic as it gets. </div>
<div>The very first dollars received will go towards replacing that structural wall first.  And then going from the outside in with fixing all of the other issues in the house. </div>
<div>I'll give a personal message of thanks to those who help me on the greatest levels in video form.  Though i truly appreciate any and all help received.  Every dollar is greatly appreciated. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">I've spent the better part of my life helping others.  I've given of all that I've had, and continue to do so now even though what I have isn't much.  </span><br/><span class=""notranslate"">The longer my house stays open to the elements the more damage that is caused. I still have to worry about folks trying to rob me.  One guy even attempted it while I was inside of the house one morning.  And that's what caused me to start cementing that wall using the bricks that were there.  I know it's not safe.  But I pray over it everyday.  I don't know when or if the city will come and condemn my home.  I'm staying with relatives who make it known daily that they don't like me being there.  And trust me when i say i miss my home and there's nowhere else i'd rather be.<br/></span></p>
<p>If you've ever had to depend on the kindness of someone else, and they've made you feel guilty and useless and worthless because you need it; you understand why i want to move back home as soon as possible.  The greatest issue is that exterior wall.  Once that's up, i know how to survive without the other utilities.  I truly appreciate any and all help you can provide.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Each October, Salem Warlock Christian Day can be seen gliding along the streets of Salem, Massachusetts on a rental Segway complete with his Witchy cape and pointy hat! However, the rentals are rarely available anymore (because the amazing Witch City Segway has become so successful!) so Christian's hoping to raise the funds for one of his own so that he can entertain visitors to Salem and New Orleans throughout the year! However, such major purchases don't just happen by the twitch of a nose. They need financing!</p>
<p><strong>To Give is to Live and to Live is to Give!</strong><br/>All it takes is a few dollars ... just the cost of a cup of coffee a day, and you can help the Warlock get his wheels ... and you won't even have to listen to Sally Struthers! Sure, this might sound like a silly endeavor, but the families that visit us here in Salem light up when they see a Witch flying through the streets and it provides a great educational opportunity to talk about real Witchcraft! If you can help us, visitors to Salem will continue to be entertained by this spectacle of glitz, glamour, and magic!</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Perks!<br/></strong>All those who wish to contribute to the cause will receive fabulous perks! Magical blessings, autographed photos, blessed and dressed candles, signed copies of Christian's book, the Witches' Book of the Dead, Psychic Readings at Christian's shop OMEN, readings by Christian himself (which he rarely does!) and even tickets to Christian's Official Salem Witches' Halloween Ball!</p>
<p>Don't touch that dial! There's a Warlock needing wheels! And while Christian doesn't have an 800 number, you can always reach him on the Ouija board! </p>

Magical blessings, autographed photos, blessed and dressed candles, signed copies of Christian's book, the Witches' Book of the Dead, Psychic Readings at Christian's shop OMEN, readings by Christian himself (which he rarely does!) and even tickets to Christian's Official Salem Witches' Halloween Ball!
Don't touch that dial! There's a Warlock needing wheels! And while Christian doesn't have an 800 number, you can always reach him on the Ouija board! 
Thank you for your contribution!

<p>NanoTouch has successfully designed, developed, fabricated and sold the first two generations of NanoSeptic products. Generation I was more of a proof of concept. It worked great, produced good lab results, and gave us some valuable experience in planning for production.

<ol>
<li>Advanced manufacturing equipment upgrades designed to handle our nanotechnology fabrication process, resulting in new products, increased effectiveness and consistency.</li>
<li>Enhanced automation including material handling (transport, feeding, stacking) allowing us to produce more products and stay ahead of worldwide demand</li>
<li>Additional research and development focused on laboratory testing  optimizing our surfaces effectiveness against the most pressing healthcare threats around the world.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign today you will be helping to bring a fun, safe place for your children to play year round.  Protected from the elements, we will be available 7 days a week.  No more kids bored at home during rainy, snowy or hot days; need somewhere to take your kids when there is no school? Bring them by and burn off all that extra energy.  At these prices the memberships will pay for themselves quickly.  Be one of the first 50 people to contribute and receive some special deals on your next annual pass.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't buy a membership or a punch pass right now? That's OK! Simply spread the word by sharing this campaign through your social media account to friends and relatives.  Getting the word out helps get this entertainment option open more quickly. </p>

<h4>Our Story<br/>
</h4>
<font>
<p>The Veneration Project was conceived by two Gen X sisters who navigated the realities of aging parents before we found our own footing in adulthood. It was a startling wake-up call to the lack of a social safety net for the aging in America, and the implications for our generation.<br/></p>
<p>As a result or our experience, we're launching the Veneration Project to engage our peers to start thinking and talking about what the future has in store for our parents and ourselves. Meanwhile, we've been sketching out what a master roadmap of aging would look like, and imaging a platform that could guide people along it.   <br/></p></font>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As Boomers enter the labyrinth of aging, families and communities will be affected in unprecedented ways.  Family members will inevitably find themselves providing a whole range of financial, time, and emotional support.  In the next twenty years, this phenomenon could easily double the losses to American businesses due to employees needing to provide various forms of care for aging loved ones – already estimated at $34 billion each year. <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: medium; color: rgb(64,64,64); font-family: 'Myriad Pro',sans-serif;"">The Veneration Project is about alleviating the perception of aging as a burden, and harnessing the potential of an aging society, so we can respond, plan and innovate in the face of a rapidly aging society.</span></p>

</div></div>","ven∙er∙a∙tion (noun): the expression of respect or reverence inspired by dignity, wisdom, dedication or talent 
Veneration's mission is to build an intergenerational movement anticipating and responding to the realities of aging in American families and communities.   We believe that appropriate, forward-thinking solutions to housing and real estate can pave the path through the legal, financial, social and emotional dimensions of aging.  Our aim is to create the environment and platform for communication, learning and planning about aging.   
Our Story


The Veneration Project was conceived by two Gen X sisters who navigated the realities of aging parents before we found our own footing in adulthood. It was a startling wake-up call to the lack of a social safety net for the aging in America, and the implications for our generation.
As a result or our experience, we're launching the Veneration Project to engage our peers to start thinking and talking about what the future has in store for our parents and ourselves. Meanwhile, we've been sketching out what a master roadmap of aging would look like, and imaging a platform that could guide people along it.   
The Impact
As Boomers enter the labyrinth of aging, families and communities will be affected in unprecedented ways.  Family members will inevitably find themselves providing a whole range of financial, time, and emotional support.  In the next twenty years, this phenomenon could easily double the losses to American businesses due to employees needing to provide various forms of care for aging loved ones – already estimated at $34 billion each year. The Veneration Project is about alleviating the perception of aging as a burden, and harnessing the potential of an aging society, so we can respond, plan and innovate in the face of a rapidly aging society.

The Status
This summer we piloted Veneration Corps, a college internship program aimed at developing a workforce capable of providing and navigating the aging resources.  We've had a team of five college students mapping out the elder service network in Brooklyn, NY, and volunteering at local elder service agencies. We're aiming to scale up Veneration Corps in 2012 as an interdisciplinary internship program, with the aim of breathing new life into the underserved field of aging.  
 
Meanwhile, we've decided our first focus will be helping navigate housing options and related planning for aging Americans and their families.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>","(Video shot and edited by Doug Vollmayer)
 
 
Our company is O-Zone Product Development,
and we have developed 4 technologies that will hit the market shortly, with
your contribution.  With a
successful campaign, we will present at least two of these technologies to
companies at INPEX Tradeshow in
June. We are here to raise capital for advanced prototypes, provisional
patents, and testing (per company request).

 
Our Story
 
 
I started O-Zone Product Development out
of my apartment while studying engineering at the University of Virginia. I had
a brief stint as an engineer in Pennsylvania but left due to lack of challenge
and also my complete obsession with new product development. O-Zone Product
Development is dedicated to developing low-tech products in fields, such as:
toy and game, kitchen gadget, athletics, and many more. I am a product
developer devoted to simplicity and necessity. I try to capture beautiful
design in each piece, but I will not hesitate to be realistic and make sure
that we are producing marketable goods. 

 
As before mentioned we have developed 4
technologies and we need a financial push to get them to a marketable status.
We have spoken to a few companies for each product and they require a few more
steps per technology. 

Products
 
 
-Cat
Feeding System: Because of the stingy eating habits of many cats, I
have redesigned the ordinary cat bowl with enhancements that, research has
shown, will have a greater than 50% euphoric effect on cats. I have reached a
point where I need to conduct direct product testing and develop factory
samples.
 
-Foot
Integrating Ankle Brace: Having ankle problems as a young football
player, I designed full-foot integrated ankle brace based of stress
concentration principles. I am looking to conduct some mechanical studies to
verify the overall concepts on video and produce more effective prototypes.
 
-No
Flat Soda: I have created a bottle cap sized device that allows soda
drinkers to increase their soda drinking pleasure by about 30-40%, by
preventing sodas from going flat so easily. I have tested the concept and am
moving into advanced prototyping.
 
-Pain-Free
Bandage Removal: I have created a very simple and small bandage improvement
to remove all small bandages painlessly, by way of a fluid filled capsule. The
prototypes work wonderfully, but the bandage companies require at least
provisional patent protection
 
 
The Impact
 
 
We have been developing most of these
concepts for over a year now and it is our true passion to produce valuable
innovations. With your investment, you are promoting creativity in the
production of your everyday goods. Every year, there are thousands of
inventions that do not even initiate due to lack of funding, and we will not
suffer the same fate.
 
                                                
 
What We Need
 
 
Capital raised will go towards:
·     
Drafting and filing necessary documents
on intellectual property
·     
Developing more advanced prototypes
·     
Consulting the necessary industry/manufacturing
experts
·     
Conducting proper lab testing
·     
Travel/Show expenses for INPEX
conference and other necessary in-person company meetings.
·      Fulfilling perks promises
 
If we meet our goal on
the site, the perks and products will be delivered as outlined. If we exceed
our goal, we will incorporate more technologies into this campaign, which means
more perks for you guys. This is our passion, and you will be promoting our
ability to continue working on these projects, so we WILL keep your best
interest at heart.
 
If we do not reach our
goal:
·      We will not be able to fund the INPEX Tradeshow trip (but will
continue to contact the companies by other means)
·      We may have to hone down the product list from 4.
·      Prototypes and testing are the highest priority, so other needs
may be cut.
 
With the way we have
budgeted ourselves, our perks will be delivered with NO dependence on the overall campaign success. That just wouldn’t
be fair because you did your part. But hopefully, there will be no need for
this discussion after the campaign.

O-Zone PD Team:
 
 
Tumi (Founder)I am the product developer in O-Zone Product Development. I began to develop products seriously in 2009 and am extremely dedicated to the field. I pride myself on breaking the normal schema of the general population with my innovations. Most importantly, I am dedicated to simplicity and necessity in design. I have gotten my feet wet with product licensing deals and am now looking to dive in. I have 12 products in my repertoire and many more on the way.
 

Chernor Jalloh (Advisor) Chernor is a Sierra Leone born Accounting Major from the University of Virginia. We became very good friends in school and I admired his supreme dedication to his schoolwork and his entrepreneurial spirit. He possesses the ruggedness of a politician with the skills of a seasoned CEO. After college, I approached him to pursue a consulting/advising role with my firm. I consult Chernor with financial matters as well as new product direction.   

Eric Pankey (Advisor)Eric and I came from the same Middle and High Schools, but never really connected until we met again in college. By nature, he has comical qualities that resonate to any person who meets him. However, after college, he has displayed an unparralled focus towards increasing his professional stock and looking into new ventures. He’s a funny guy, but a meticulous and stone-faced businessman. A recent addition, I consult Eric on market analysis and product breadth.

<p>We are Mark &amp; Andrea Newell, and we're preparing to open Toronto's first Bohemian tea house, board game room and hookah lounge.  </p>
<p>With backgrounds in the culinary arts, events management, music, photography, performance, and making things awesome, our plan is to bring all of these things together to create a community space full of warmth, comfort, and entertainment. We're very passionate about getting our tea house off the ground because although Toronto has plenty of bars and cafes, there is a shortage of spaces that act as a public living room - and that's what we want to give you.</p>
<p><b>What is a Bohemian tea house?</b></p>
<p>The Czech tea house tradition was started by a group of committed tea enthusiasts who continued to illegally import, brew, and sample tea during the Communist Era. After the Velvet Revolution these daring souls opened up shop in Prague, and their passion for tea and its surrounding culture sparked what is now a major industry in the Czech Republic. Today the country, which is less than 1/10th the size of the province of Ontario, is home to more than 300 tea houses.  After two visits to Prague to tour these tea rooms, their immense popularity is no mystery to us.  
The majority of customers seem to find there is something beyond the benefits of mere tea drinking that come with visiting a tea house. Some have described it as a sense of ‘sanctuary’, while others say they love getting away from the usual noisy, bustling atmosphere you find in a crowded bar or a modern, laptop-filled coffee shop. 
All of the staples for creating this type of ‘magic’ space will be in evidence at Bampot: there will be warm lighting, comfortable seating, multitudes of unique teas, affordable yet delectable food, games to play, tobacco-free hookahs to smoke, and above all an unhurried mode of operations that lets you order, lounge and leave at your own pace. </p>
<p><b>Our Tea</b></p>
<p>From the steamy depths of Assam, to the lofty peaks of Yunnan, Bampot will stock a dazzling array of the finest loose leaf teas in the world. We take the time to sift through the offerings of each year’s harvest so that we can offer you nothing but the best. 
Black teas will be available from every region and in every flavour imaginable, and we will also have an extensive and frequently-updated collection of green, oolong, and white teas. Our herbal infusions will come as a pleasant surprise to those trying to avoid caffeine – no bland, watery, faintly floral cups of hot water here. With more than 30 blending components to work with we’ve developed some truly memorable brews that will drive thoughts of black tea right out of your head.
Most of our tea will be served in teapots with a small drinking bowl, which allows you to drink at your own pace while the tea stays warm. Other options will include mate gourds, tea lattes, and iced teas. </p>
<p><b>Beyond the Tea</b></p>
Tea is amazing, but you can’t survive on it forever. With that in mind you’ll find delicious food available that ranges from well-known Mediterranean dishes (hummus, falafel, baklava, pita) to homestyle snacks (cheese and crackers, pistachios, cookies) to gluten-free options and a little bit of everything in between. Our ingredients will be locally sourced wherever possible, and our prices will keep you coming back for more.
Tobacco-free hookahs are another treat we’ll offer at Bampot, featuring every flavour of tea-leaf-based shisha we can get our hands on. Tea-sha provides a smooth, flavourful smoke that is gentle on the throat and free of tar and nicotine.

<p><b>Entertainment</b></p>
<p>On a night out at Bampot we want to make sure you’re enjoying every moment, which is why we’ll be providing a few different options for your amusement. A wide variety of board games will be available, with seating areas built to purpose where you can play with as many as 10 people. We’ll have every game you’ve heard of and many you haven’t, but if there’s anything we’ve missed just let us know and we’ll get it in for your next visit.
If your date is late or you’ve come by and you just don’t want to leave, you can pick up a book from our in-house library and read away the hours.
Live music or other types of shows will be featured a few times each week, ranging from acoustic folk to captivating cabarets. 
And finally our walls will play host to an ever-changing collection of artwork by Canadian artists – and we’re always open to new submissions if you’ve got something beautiful to add.</p>
<p><b>What we need and what you’ll get</b></p>
Your contributions will make a world of difference to the atmosphere that we are able to provide. The building we are renovating has only ever been used as a family residence, and there is a fair amount of work involved in getting it ready to house a business.
We will be using every last penny we have in conjunction with funding from the Canadian Youth Business Foundation to get Bampot off the ground, but even with these two funding sources we still fall short on some important projects.  Your money will go towards:<br/>
●  a vital facelift for the building’s rather residential facade <br/>
● an extensive overhaul of the kitchen to make it restaurant-ready<br/>
●  a second bathroom for customer use to be installed in the basement <br/>
●  wooden seating platforms where you can take your shoes off and lounge amongst piles of cushions and rugs <br/>
●  equipment – refrigeration, countertops, sinks, water heaters, a commercial dishwasher, etc. <br/>
●  and a host of smaller details, like wooden panelling, doorway reshaping, and shelving to keep the ambiance consistent.<p></p>
<p><b>Reaching Our Goal</b></p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the funds we receive will still be put towards the renovations. It would, however, mean that not all of the projects above could be completed, and that will inevitably impact the quality and the character of the space we are able to offer upon opening. 
With this in mind, we are doing everything we can to make it worth your while to help fund Bampot. Besides ending up with a wonderful place in your city where you can enjoy all the tea, food and board gaming you can handle, you will also be an enormous part of helping to add to the diversity of Toronto’s hospitality scene – we’ve looked, and there’s nothing like Bampot currently running in the GTA.  Wouldn’t you love to have a new and exciting option for a night out?<br/>
Plus, of course, there are the perks. Most of what’s available are vouchers to enjoy all that Bampot has to offer, though you’ll also find options including custom tshirts, handmade mugs, and other Bampot gear you’ll actually use.<br/>
We understand that not everyone is able to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Every share, like and link we get will help spread the word. So if you're part of the Toronto community and you want to see this space happen, please - let other people know about it! We are so grateful for every dollar and every share you give.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","About Us

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">The Sip &amp; Spoke Bike Kitchen will be co‐located with Bowdoin Bike School, a nonprofit bicycle repair and education center that uses the bicycle to encourage youth development, economic self-sufficiency, transit justice, and health equity. By providing low-cost repair services and free instruction, Bowdoin Bike School makes cycling accessible to those underserved by traditional bike shops. Founded in 2013 by Noah Hicks, the school’s mission reflects both community need and the personal history and experiences of its charismatic founder.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Noah Hicks was born and raised in Boston’s
Bowdoin-Geneva neighborhood and began cycling at the tender age of three. As a
teenager, Hicks started tinkering with bicycles in his family’s basement in
inner-city Boston, a neighborhood underserved by traditional bicycle shops. His
hobby became a lifestyle, providing plenty of spending money and exposure to
culture, green spaces, and social activities outside of his neighborhood.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p>In 2013, Hicks turned an 8’ x 10’
shed in a local park into a pop-up, seasonal bicycle school offering low-cost
bicycles and repair lessons to the community. With a dedicated crew of teenage
volunteers, Bowdoin Bike School saved countless bicycles from the trash heaps,
safely led group bicycle rides through the neighborhood, and outfitted new
riders with free locks, lights, and helmets. In partnership with Victory
Programs, Hicks launched an earn-a-bike initiative for formerly homeless
individuals in the community, connecting them with an affordable means of
transportation and the opportunity to share their newly-minted mechanical
skills with other burgeoning cyclists. Hicks then spearheaded a successful
online fundraising campaign to support the expansion of Bowdoin Bike School
into a brick-and-mortar location and hire his volunteer corps. The corps
converted a long-vacant automotive repair garage into a bicycle retail shop and
education center, planning classes for women, queer youth of color, and
working parents.</p>

<p>In housing the
nonprofit Bowdoin Bike School within The Sip &amp; Spoke Bike Kitchen, Hicks is creating a
dynamic hybrid model that seeks to use the bicycle as a means of creating
opportunity and synergy both for and between residents of communities deeply
affected by poverty and for the growing regional biking community. The result will be an active and positive community hub.<br/></p>
<p>THE BUILDING<br/>
This project is also an opportunity for community-driven historic preservation
and revitalization. Uniquely, The Sip &amp; Spoke Bike Kitchen and Bowdoin Bike School will
be co‐located in the Upham's Corner Comfort Station built in 1912 for the trolley car
system. In partnership with Historic Boston Incorporated, The Sip &amp; Spoke Bike Kitchen will
preserve and reuse this historic building, helping to reactivate a key portion
of the commercial business district, preserve an important piece of historic
architecture, and reconnect the Comfort Station to its original
transportation-related roots.</p>
<p>The building lies on what was
once part of the Dorchester North Burying Ground which is listed in the State
and National Register of Historic Places and within the Boston Landmark
designation. Rehabilitation of the comfort station building helps tell the story of the
City of Boston’s 19th century expansion and the Dorchester neighborhood’s
urbanization and related transportation growth into the 20th century. The comfort station is a remnant of a time of growth and transportation innovation.
Its rehabilitation and reuse--particularly for a transportation related purpose--will
help to preserve and express that story.</p>
<p>WHY COMMUNITY CROWDFUNDING?</p>
<p></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">The Sip &amp; Spoke Bike Kitchen benefits from foundational community support
unavailable to most conventional entrepreneurial businesses. The business model
was developed through iterative discussions with residents, community groups,
and the broader Dorchester business community. It was also shaped by the
personal history and experiences of its founder, who has designed a productive
and creative for-profit retail business that aligns closely with neighborhood
goals and the mission of the nonprofit Bowdoin Bike School.</span></p>
<p>Community support is vital to
realizing this project. While financing is in place to restore the historic structure, funds are needed to build-out the interior of the business and
create a functional bike shop and café. Without your support, Noah Hicks will need
to take on more debt, resulting in higher prices for local customers, many of whom cannot
afford the cost. </p>

By providing low-cost repair services and free instruction, Bowdoin Bike School makes cycling accessible to those underserved by traditional bike shops. Founded in 2013 by Noah Hicks, the school’s mission reflects both community need and the personal history and experiences of its charismatic founder.
Noah Hicks was born and raised in Boston’s
Bowdoin-Geneva neighborhood and began cycling at the tender age of three. As a
teenager, Hicks started tinkering with bicycles in his family’s basement in
inner-city Boston, a neighborhood underserved by traditional bicycle shops. His
hobby became a lifestyle, providing plenty of spending money and exposure to
culture, green spaces, and social activities outside of his neighborhood.


In 2013, Hicks turned an 8’ x 10’
shed in a local park into a pop-up, seasonal bicycle school offering low-cost
bicycles and repair lessons to the community. With a dedicated crew of teenage
volunteers, Bowdoin Bike School saved countless bicycles from the trash heaps,
safely led group bicycle rides through the neighborhood, and outfitted new
riders with free locks, lights, and helmets. In partnership with Victory
Programs, Hicks launched an earn-a-bike initiative for formerly homeless
individuals in the community, connecting them with an affordable means of
transportation and the opportunity to share their newly-minted mechanical
skills with other burgeoning cyclists. Hicks then spearheaded a successful
online fundraising campaign to support the expansion of Bowdoin Bike School
into a brick-and-mortar location and hire his volunteer corps. The corps
converted a long-vacant automotive repair garage into a bicycle retail shop and
education center, planning classes for women, queer youth of color, and
working parents.


In housing the
nonprofit Bowdoin Bike School within The Sip & Spoke Bike Kitchen, Hicks is creating a
dynamic hybrid model that seeks to use the bicycle as a means of creating
opportunity and synergy both for and between residents of communities deeply
affected by poverty and for the growing regional biking community. The result will be an active and positive community hub.
THE BUILDING
This project is also an opportunity for community-driven historic preservation
and revitalization. Uniquely, The Sip & Spoke Bike Kitchen and Bowdoin Bike School will
be co‐located in the Upham's Corner Comfort Station built in 1912 for the trolley car
system. In partnership with Historic Boston Incorporated, The Sip & Spoke Bike Kitchen will
preserve and reuse this historic building, helping to reactivate a key portion
of the commercial business district, preserve an important piece of historic
architecture, and reconnect the Comfort Station to its original
transportation-related roots.
The building lies on what was
once part of the Dorchester North Burying Ground which is listed in the State
and National Register of Historic Places and within the Boston Landmark
designation. Rehabilitation of the comfort station building helps tell the story of the
City of Boston’s 19th century expansion and the Dorchester neighborhood’s
urbanization and related transportation growth into the 20th century. The comfort station is a remnant of a time of growth and transportation innovation.
Its rehabilitation and reuse--particularly for a transportation related purpose--will
help to preserve and express that story.
WHY COMMUNITY CROWDFUNDING?


The Sip & Spoke Bike Kitchen benefits from foundational community support
unavailable to most conventional entrepreneurial businesses. The business model
was developed through iterative discussions with residents, community groups,
and the broader Dorchester business community. It was also shaped by the
personal history and experiences of its founder, who has designed a productive
and creative for-profit retail business that aligns closely with neighborhood
goals and the mission of the nonprofit Bowdoin Bike School.
Community support is vital to
realizing this project. While financing is in place to restore the historic structure, funds are needed to build-out the interior of the business and
create a functional bike shop and café. Without your support, Noah Hicks will need
to take on more debt, resulting in higher prices for local customers, many of whom cannot
afford the cost. 
Your donation will help us bring this
impactful, community-driven project to life. Thank you for your support
Note: 100% of donations will benefit The Sip & Spoke Bike Kitchen. Donations will be collected by The American City Coalition, a 501(c)(3) non-profit partner. Therefore, all donations are tax-deductible to the extent provided by the law.",4.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>Combined with the support <strong>YOU, our community stakeholders</strong>, we will strive to make Dice City Games a second home for both competitive and casual gamers alike. One the community deserves.  </p>

<h2>What expenses will this campaign cover?</h2>
<p>Your contribution will go towards <strong>vital finishing funds</strong> in several areas:</p>
<p>1.) <strong>Compensating the creative talent behind this project</strong>, including videographers, photographers, graphic designers, and the artists who designed our perks. Because we are purchasing American-made products from vendors who provide living wages, roughly 25% of funds raised alone will go to covering the cost of manufacture of the backer perks.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>Helping defray incidental costs</strong>, including legal fees, supply expenses, pop-up event costs, and R&amp;D costs.</p>
<p>3.) <strong>Helping defray startup costs</strong>, including our first month's rent, build-out expenses, and if we exceed our goal, improved fixtures and displays.</p>
<p>4.) <strong>Indiegogo deducts 5%, plus 3.3% is additionally deducted </strong>by third party processors from all funds we raise in this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Where will the funding <u>not go</u>?</strong> Since Dice City Games has been in development for over six months, the bulk of our inventory has already been purchased. Any further inventory we purchase before opening will come from our private investment.</p>
<p>On that note, <strong>90-95% of Dice City Games' funding and start-up costs are self-funded by the ownership and supplemented by loans;</strong> this campaign represents the final 5-10% push .</p>
<h2>What are the risks?</h2>
<p>As with every new business, there are risks involved. We’ve identified our three biggest challenges, and identified ways to mitigate them:</p>
<p><strong>Securing our proposed location.</strong> We have been in negotiation with the landlord for our proposed location near the Wheaton Metro. However, we do not feel comfortable signing for a five-year commitment until we have funded this campaign and have the demonstrated-support of the community behind us. Until we officially make the commitment and sign a lease, there remains the possibility of the landlord offering someone else the space. To mitigate this risk, we have identified several back-up spaces and are in negotiation on those spaces as well. There is also the possibility of negotiations stalling if we can't reach terms with a landlord that are fair and conducive to business.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488402024/awqg6qw2ncskilfs1bsx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Red tape and bureaucracy.</strong> New businesses in our home county are prone to running into red tape and unforeseen obstacles. To anticipate these concerns, our Board of Advisers includes a local lawyer and the owner of a fellow forward-thinking brick &amp; mortar business that has ahad success in Montgomery County.</p>
<p><strong>The day-to-day challenges of managing chronic illness.</strong> Part of the reason building a welcoming, inclusive community is so important to the Dice City Games team is that members of our core founding team have been managing chronic illness and rare diseases, in some cases since birth, adding an additional layer to the stress and considerations of starting a new business. Unexpected health road bumps have already come up, but by building an agile, collaborative, and multi-talented core team, we’ve been able to overcome them and edge Dice City Games ever closer to becoming reality.</p>
<h3><strong>In Conclusion...</strong></h3>
<p>We've seen many people shy away from the dream of opening a brick-and-mortar business that celebrates the hobbies they love. We know that in the age of corporate buyouts and a consolidation of the market to online mega-sites.. community-focused, small, retail businesses are becoming rarer by the day.  However, we also know that geekdom is expanding and shows no sign of slowing down, and no-one is better fit to serve the gamer community than it’s life-long local participants  -- especially when they are dynamic and forward-thinking business people. Given our team’s love of hobby games and experience with startup businesses we are confident that Dice City Games will become a destination for the geek in all of us!</p>

We will actively and regularly poll customers for what games you are interested in us stocking and hosting events for.Our multiple weekly Magic: The Gathering offerings will cater to both the casual and competitive player. We are excited to host tournaments for all of the major sanctioned formats (Limited, Standard, Modern, Legacy, Vintage) as well as to host periodic beginner days where we teach new players of all ages how to play.We will lead the charge for organized play of community-driven formats  -- think EDH, 1 v 1 Commander, Pauper, Old School, Cube Draft, Chaos Draft, and beyond.Making inclusivity key. Dice City Games values creating a welcoming space, and will respect our patrons through our suggested Player Code of Conduct, policies, and a staff who pledge to lead by example. We welcome gamers of all: levels of skill, physical ability, age, economic status, gender expression, sexuality, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, creed, and political affiliation. We are here to facilitate such a space, but not to tell you how to live outside of our store, regardless of whether you are a progressive, a liberal, a libertarian, a conservative, or apolitical. All are welcome. Bullying and harassment will not be a part of store culture. We come together to build each other up, through mutual respect.Designing for accessibility. Whether you’re from next door in D.C., from Montgomery or Prince George's Counties, or further out, Dice City Games aims to be easily accessible regardless of your form of transportation. Our proposed space is conveniently located in Wheaton, Maryland just over the D.C. border, and is Metro-adjacent, near ample public parking, is easily reached via Metrobus and Ride-On, and also convenient via MARC Train and the Capitol Beltway. We plan to have a wheelchair-accessible entrance.Multilingual accessibility is important to us as well, so we will stock boardgames in a variety of languages. We plan to be the first area store to regularly stock Spanish-language Magic cards upon release.Promoting ethically-sourced products. We will carry items that are fair-trade, union-made, green, and/or American-made whenever possible. We’ll sell vintage / secondhand items when possible to help reduce factory waste. We’re planning accounts with vendors like Looney Labs who design great games like Fluxx --right here, in neighboring College Park, MD -- and Game Science, who are not only the sole USA dice manufacturer, but also producer of the world's most accurate dice.  Part of the backer perks, their precision dice set will ensure you fair rolls and fun discussion pieces for years to come. Always looking to buy. We want to give you top dollar for your old stuff, with trade-in credit-bonuses. Help our selection grow, while turning your trash into treasure!Operating locally, while making an impact in the wider gaming community. While our mission starts here, we plan to create original content focused on video games, board games, and cinema, to keep you informed, wherever you live. Our website will feature original video content, podcasts, and articles about your favorite hobbies, as well as a major online store that will be launched at a later date. Our content team includes creators such as fandom & Star Wars expert Fiona Barbour, and Joel Sadowsky, member of 2015 World Magic Cup Team USA. We will stream in-store events, including tournaments for underserved Magic formats like Legacy, Vintage, Pauper, and Old School.
So what will Dice City Games stock?

Cream-of-the crop board games, including select popular titles from Rio Grande, Mayfair, Ravensburger, Days of Wonder, Fantasy Flight, Blue Orange, Steve Jackson, SlugFest and Wyrd Games, among others.

Pen & paper RPGs, including Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder, but also out-of-print titles from TSR, Games Workshop, and White Wolf Games.
Retro videogames, including rare, import, and classic software and vintage home consoles from Nintendo, Sega, Atari, Sony, and beyond. Imagine walking into a local game store and finding a top-loader NES, Dreamcast, Virtual Boy, Turbo-Grafx16, Super Famicom, Vectrex, or Neo-Geo on the shelf...

The entire Magic Multiverse. Yes, all of it. Already purchased, our Magic singles inventory will be the most exhaustive in town, on opening day. We aim to stock every non-foil/promo card in print from 1994 to today, as well as many foils. We already have hot standard cards, Modern staples, original dual lands, Reserved Lists cards, and rare EDH gems, along with the widest selection of sealed and out-of-print Magic packs in the area! Plus, popular accessories from KMC, Dragon Shield, Ultra Pro, Dex Protection, Monster, Deck Tutor, and more will be available to keep your collection clean and organized.
A carefully curated selection of geeky odds & ends, including comic book paraphernalia, fandom collectibles and apparel, fanzines, vinyl records, vintage movie posters, and cult classic movies on HD, DVD, VHS and even LaserDisc.

A University of Maryland  alum with a B.A. in American Studies + minors in Media Studies and Ethnic Studies, Jimmy believes that comic books, science fiction, pop culture, vinyl record albums, and cult classic cinema are all inherently culturally significant.

Eric Lee is a Dice City Games Tournament Organizer. A research assistant at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and proud immigrant from Singapore to the United States, Eric loves the community side of Magic, but can also play competitively, with frequent successes in the IQ, SCG, and GP circuit. He enjoys painting Warhammer miniatures and looks forward to sharing with players at our events the joy of a well-organized, clean, fair, and friendly play-environment.

She is a professional political strategist; a singer, blerd, and member of the Washington Metropolitan Gamer Symphony Orchestra.  Shaunica will school you in Settlers of Cataan, but you can keep Splendor to yourself. She's currently excited to be learning Magic.

Julian Marin is a strategic adviser to Dice City Games, and intends to be one of the store’s Magic judges. He has a penchant for organizing and growing gaming spaces, having worked as a longtime Level 2 Magic Judge and as an editor/author on MTGFanatic.com. He is a lifelong gamer, working in DC as a business analyst. Julian frequently enjoys boardgaming, tabletop roleplaying, Magic (Commander, tho he recently Day-2'd a limited GP), and returning to his alma mater's annual 100+player LARP (Live-Action Role-Playing) game, which he co-founded.  
Our Board of Advisers is composed of talented people from across the spectrums of professional expertise, gender, ethnicity, and hobby -- shout outs to Lizz, Sean, David, Cory, John, Lily, Tani, Sam, Nathan, Annalee, Stevan, and co. -- who will offer us valuable guidance.
Combined with the support YOU, our community stakeholders, we will strive to make Dice City Games a second home for both competitive and casual gamers alike. One the community deserves.  

What expenses will this campaign cover?
Your contribution will go towards vital finishing funds in several areas:
1.) Compensating the creative talent behind this project, including videographers, photographers, graphic designers, and the artists who designed our perks. Because we are purchasing American-made products from vendors who provide living wages, roughly 25% of funds raised alone will go to covering the cost of manufacture of the backer perks.
2.) Helping defray incidental costs, including legal fees, supply expenses, pop-up event costs, and R&D costs.
3.) Helping defray startup costs, including our first month's rent, build-out expenses, and if we exceed our goal, improved fixtures and displays.
4.) Indiegogo deducts 5%, plus 3.3% is additionally deducted by third party processors from all funds we raise in this campaign.
Where will the funding not go? Since Dice City Games has been in development for over six months, the bulk of our inventory has already been purchased. Any further inventory we purchase before opening will come from our private investment.
On that note, 90-95% of Dice City Games' funding and start-up costs are self-funded by the ownership and supplemented by loans; this campaign represents the final 5-10% push .
What are the risks?
As with every new business, there are risks involved. We’ve identified our three biggest challenges, and identified ways to mitigate them:
Securing our proposed location. We have been in negotiation with the landlord for our proposed location near the Wheaton Metro. However, we do not feel comfortable signing for a five-year commitment until we have funded this campaign and have the demonstrated-support of the community behind us. Until we officially make the commitment and sign a lease, there remains the possibility of the landlord offering someone else the space. To mitigate this risk, we have identified several back-up spaces and are in negotiation on those spaces as well. There is also the possibility of negotiations stalling if we can't reach terms with a landlord that are fair and conducive to business.

Red tape and bureaucracy. New businesses in our home county are prone to running into red tape and unforeseen obstacles. To anticipate these concerns, our Board of Advisers includes a local lawyer and the owner of a fellow forward-thinking brick & mortar business that has ahad success in Montgomery County.
The day-to-day challenges of managing chronic illness. Part of the reason building a welcoming, inclusive community is so important to the Dice City Games team is that members of our core founding team have been managing chronic illness and rare diseases, in some cases since birth, adding an additional layer to the stress and considerations of starting a new business. Unexpected health road bumps have already come up, but by building an agile, collaborative, and multi-talented core team, we’ve been able to overcome them and edge Dice City Games ever closer to becoming reality.
In Conclusion...
We've seen many people shy away from the dream of opening a brick-and-mortar business that celebrates the hobbies they love. We know that in the age of corporate buyouts and a consolidation of the market to online mega-sites.. community-focused, small, retail businesses are becoming rarer by the day.  However, we also know that geekdom is expanding and shows no sign of slowing down, and no-one is better fit to serve the gamer community than it’s life-long local participants  -- especially when they are dynamic and forward-thinking business people. Given our team’s love of hobby games and experience with startup businesses we are confident that Dice City Games will become a destination for the geek in all of us!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>What is KLEUR?</h3> <p>By surface definition, we are a boutique where you will find an eclectic mix of  curated, quality miscellany for the home and self, both handcrafted and found. Below the surface, KLEUR will be a community hive for curiosity, conversation, and education. Please read on to find out what that means. </p>
<p>KLEUR is <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">a shop where you can stop in and find:</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- His and Her apparel      -Hand crafted designer clothing originals    </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- Handpicked found goods for the home -Handpicked One-of-a-Kind clothing finds</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> - Wood-crafted furniture, originals   - Eclectic Adornments</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-Found </span>eclectic<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> furniture pieces  - crafted Body &amp; Beauty products</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- Jewelry, both hand-forged and found   - Lighting   - Wall decor  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> -Original art and prints     - Weavings and other textile &amp; fiber work  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- Gently used and new books   - Zines &amp; Other press    - Kitchenware</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-Artist and Maker Supplies, gently used and new    - Maker and crafter tools</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p>Most of our goods will be hand made or hand-picked by North Carolina locals. With our operating model (described in detail below), the makers and curators featured in KLEUR are making more money for their hard work AND increasing their national visibility. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Twenty or so years ago, shops like ours began popping up all over the world, with an intense resurgence in the trend in the last ten years, since social media began inspiring people like us all over the country to create their own version. A blend of minimal and simplistic style, combined with the classics, creates an aesthetic in our shop that is rich in both modern and vintage tastes. Each item available to you at KLEUR is chosen for it's tasteful simplicity and it's role in our modern-nostalgic style. Our goods are carefully designed or hand-picked for their role in this aesthetic, and reflects high quality craftsmanship, taste, and care. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THAT is the boutique side of things. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Under the skin, however, our goals are much bigger. While by day we may seem like a simple shop, if you look on our front door or on our website you will find a calendar of events: on several evenings throughout the week and during the weekends, we will work hard to provide inexpensive or free workshops, tutorials, discussions, salons, readings, and similar social events that are intended to enrich not just the </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">active</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> arts community downtown, but </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">attract</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and involve the rest of the community as well. We are BEYOND excited to offer downtown WSNC an intimate and casual setting for maker-skill workshops, how-tos for household projects, discussions about music, race, gender, public education, fear, empathy, anger, love, art, and the allure of laziness. </span><br/></p>
<p> We are excited to invite you to participate in hands-on community-building that explores how lines can blur. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Boutique by day, innovative community clubhouse by night. We hope you will support us! We can't wait to be your neighbors this October. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p>Please scroll to the bottom for links to shops like ours, many of which we have already connected with.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Are Asking For &amp; Why</h3> <p>Because we are makers ourselves, it is difficult for us to come up with a financial safety-net that will ensure KLEUR's survival and maintenance (described below) during those first months. We are confident that we will surely be able to stand on our own feet in a short period of time (because, we swear, you will like us!), but we've worked out that ONE YEAR'S worth of expenses up front will allow us to offer you and our makers much, much more. <br/></p>
<p>Let us break down what we are asking for and why.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<ul> <li>The goal of $12,500 will just about cover our expenses to maintain the shop for one year. This will allow us the flexibility to raise our own money through purchases while at the same time making sure the makers </li>
<li>CONSIGNMENT. The work that will be available in the shop will mostly be made by North Carolina makers (most of them local) who are willing to sell their goods by consignment, meaning we take a percentage commission. We are dedicated to asking for HALF of what other shops who work on this model ask for, to ensure that our makers get as much as they can from each sale. In order to keep our commission so low, we need a cushion of funds for our first year, to give us the space to build our own funds from these commissions. </li>
<li>WHOLESALE. Some of the goods in our shop will be purchased wholesale from their suppliers. These goods will mostly be purchased from makers in far-off cities like Atlanta, Portland, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Nashville, and other non-local areas. Having this opportunity means we can bring you goods not normally found in this area, saving you travel or shipping fees (a.k.a. Convenience!) To put it bluntly: You can come into our shop and find some cool stuff you'd only see in other areas. </li> <li>ALL funds made from this campaign will go toward the following: Rent and other monthly expenses, PR and marketing, creating workshops and other events, shop maintenance, and wholesale purchases for selling. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>IN RETURN: Our Impact</h3>
<div>We don't want you to think we are asking something for nothing. In addition to the (comparably) humble tokens of thanks we will give to each doner, we are 100% dedicated to making KLEUR an asset to our fast-growing downtown arts community. Not just a storefront, KLEUR is going to be an active part of the local scene in terms of community empowerment, education, and inspiration. We plan to do this through events offered weekly, either free or at low-cost. This we believe is truly a way we can ""give back"" to everyone who chooses to be involved. Anyone who contribute to this effort will be among the first to know about the following:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>WORKSHOPS &amp; TUTORIALS - A CASUAL SETTING FOR SKILL LEARNING: Think about all the different things that you've wanted to take a quick class on. Have you ever wanted to get the basics on how to arrange flowers? Planting and maintaining an herb garden? The basics of leather working? Basic fashion design. How to ground an outlet. Book-binding. Hand-lettering. Quilting basics. Tool safety. Jewelry design. Creating fragrances. Upholstering basics. Restoring a Goodwill-found turntable sound-system. How to make knives. Basic yoga or Pilates. Tricks for eating wholly on a budget. Urban farming. Urban renewal. Dying fabric. Weaving. Chair caning. The list goes on. </div>
<div>While there are certainly community opportunities for some fantastic skill-building in the arts scene, we hope to keep ours low-commitment and low-cost, in a casual setting. In addition, we do not want to restrict ourselves to only tutorials </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>LOCAL ENGAGEMENT WITH CURRENT ISSUES - Similar to above, but more suited to formal and informal discussion, KLEUR will be the host site of many salons and discussions regarding current and ongoing social issues, both specific and general: Racial equity, Humans and their relationship to Empathy, Gender equality, socio-economic disparity, the state of public education in North Carolina, upcoming election and political issues, clean water, at-risk and high-risk teens, the death (or rise) of art, and on and on and on...<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div> <p>NETWORKING AND VISIBILITY FOR OUR MAKERS (and WSNC)</p>
<p>We mentioned already that our commission rate is much lower than other shops like ours (made possible by donors like you), but the added HUGE benefit to the makers who have their work in KLEUR is the increase in their visibility! Here's putting it simply: by digitally connecting with hundreds of shops similar to ours on forums like Instagram, we are interacting daily with owners and patrons of like-shops in cities like San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Chicago, Nashville, Richmond, and so forth. We ""like"" their photos, they ""like"" ours (it sounds trite, but hang on a minute here), and inevitably perhaps WE see a product for sale in their shop that we have to have. We contact the maker via Instagram. We ask them for a Wholesale order, and BAM, Jewelry Maker for Melting Sun Apparel from Atlanta, GA is in KLEUR (this is a true story...this is exactly how we have snagged many of our out-of-town makers)...Well, the same is true on the flip side. Say a shop in California sees a local WSNC maker's work on our feed. They contact him/her directly. Wholesale order. Suddenly a WSNC has their work in a shop across the country, and the orders keep on coming. </p>
<p>If this seems like a fairy tale, we assure you it is not. We have done our homework on this incredible phenomenon called Social Media and what it can do instantly for a hand-crafter's career.</p>
<p>The reality: if we do this well, and continue to be as networked as we potentially will be in this maker-lifestyle movement, we can add to the appeal of Winston Salem on the world stage as a hub for arts and innovation. </p>

<h3>Future KLEUR Endeavors...</h3>
<br/><p>TOOL-SHARE PROGRAM  -  A major future goal of ours, we have already started collecting and storing a vast arrangement of gently used hand tools, including presses, vices, awls, files, mallets, saws, and the like. We are working to develop a tool-share program, where members can come to us, exchange a token, and rent a tool for free for as long as they need it. </p>
<p>MAKER and ART SUPPLIES - As time goes on and networks improve, we hope to eventually offer a selection of choice pigments, canvas, brushes, solvents, other mediums, textiles and fibers, and additional supplies. </p>

</div></div>","What is KLEUR? By surface definition, we are a boutique where you will find an eclectic mix of  curated, quality miscellany for the home and self, both handcrafted and found. Below the surface, KLEUR will be a community hive for curiosity, conversation, and education. Please read on to find out what that means. 
KLEUR is a shop where you can stop in and find:
- His and Her apparel      -Hand crafted designer clothing originals    
- Handpicked found goods for the home -Handpicked One-of-a-Kind clothing finds
 - Wood-crafted furniture, originals   - Eclectic Adornments
-Found eclectic furniture pieces  - crafted Body & Beauty products
- Jewelry, both hand-forged and found   - Lighting   - Wall decor  
 -Original art and prints     - Weavings and other textile & fiber work  
- Gently used and new books   - Zines & Other press    - Kitchenware
-Hand-forged wooden wares   - Leather goods   - Bags and other accessories
-Artist and Maker Supplies, gently used and new    - Maker and crafter tools

Most of our goods will be hand made or hand-picked by North Carolina locals. With our operating model (described in detail below), the makers and curators featured in KLEUR are making more money for their hard work AND increasing their national visibility. Twenty or so years ago, shops like ours began popping up all over the world, with an intense resurgence in the trend in the last ten years, since social media began inspiring people like us all over the country to create their own version. A blend of minimal and simplistic style, combined with the classics, creates an aesthetic in our shop that is rich in both modern and vintage tastes. Each item available to you at KLEUR is chosen for it's tasteful simplicity and it's role in our modern-nostalgic style. Our goods are carefully designed or hand-picked for their role in this aesthetic, and reflects high quality craftsmanship, taste, and care. 
THAT is the boutique side of things. 
Under the skin, however, our goals are much bigger. While by day we may seem like a simple shop, if you look on our front door or on our website you will find a calendar of events: on several evenings throughout the week and during the weekends, we will work hard to provide inexpensive or free workshops, tutorials, discussions, salons, readings, and similar social events that are intended to enrich not just the active arts community downtown, but attract and involve the rest of the community as well. We are BEYOND excited to offer downtown WSNC an intimate and casual setting for maker-skill workshops, how-tos for household projects, discussions about music, race, gender, public education, fear, empathy, anger, love, art, and the allure of laziness. 
 We are excited to invite you to participate in hands-on community-building that explores how lines can blur. 

Boutique by day, innovative community clubhouse by night. We hope you will support us! We can't wait to be your neighbors this October. 

Please scroll to the bottom for links to shops like ours, many of which we have already connected with.
   What We Are Asking For & Why Because we are makers ourselves, it is difficult for us to come up with a financial safety-net that will ensure KLEUR's survival and maintenance (described below) during those first months. We are confident that we will surely be able to stand on our own feet in a short period of time (because, we swear, you will like us!), but we've worked out that ONE YEAR'S worth of expenses up front will allow us to offer you and our makers much, much more. 
Let us break down what we are asking for and why. 
 The goal of $12,500 will just about cover our expenses to maintain the shop for one year. This will allow us the flexibility to raise our own money through purchases while at the same time making sure the makers 
CONSIGNMENT. The work that will be available in the shop will mostly be made by North Carolina makers (most of them local) who are willing to sell their goods by consignment, meaning we take a percentage commission. We are dedicated to asking for HALF of what other shops who work on this model ask for, to ensure that our makers get as much as they can from each sale. In order to keep our commission so low, we need a cushion of funds for our first year, to give us the space to build our own funds from these commissions. 
WHOLESALE. Some of the goods in our shop will be purchased wholesale from their suppliers. These goods will mostly be purchased from makers in far-off cities like Atlanta, Portland, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Nashville, and other non-local areas. Having this opportunity means we can bring you goods not normally found in this area, saving you travel or shipping fees (a.k.a. Convenience!) To put it bluntly: You can come into our shop and find some cool stuff you'd only see in other areas.  ALL funds made from this campaign will go toward the following: Rent and other monthly expenses, PR and marketing, creating workshops and other events, shop maintenance, and wholesale purchases for selling.     
IN RETURN: Our Impact
We don't want you to think we are asking something for nothing. In addition to the (comparably) humble tokens of thanks we will give to each doner, we are 100% dedicated to making KLEUR an asset to our fast-growing downtown arts community. Not just a storefront, KLEUR is going to be an active part of the local scene in terms of community empowerment, education, and inspiration. We plan to do this through events offered weekly, either free or at low-cost. This we believe is truly a way we can ""give back"" to everyone who chooses to be involved. Anyone who contribute to this effort will be among the first to know about the following:

WORKSHOPS & TUTORIALS - A CASUAL SETTING FOR SKILL LEARNING: Think about all the different things that you've wanted to take a quick class on. Have you ever wanted to get the basics on how to arrange flowers? Planting and maintaining an herb garden? The basics of leather working? Basic fashion design. How to ground an outlet. Book-binding. Hand-lettering. Quilting basics. Tool safety. Jewelry design. Creating fragrances. Upholstering basics. Restoring a Goodwill-found turntable sound-system. How to make knives. Basic yoga or Pilates. Tricks for eating wholly on a budget. Urban farming. Urban renewal. Dying fabric. Weaving. Chair caning. The list goes on. 
While there are certainly community opportunities for some fantastic skill-building in the arts scene, we hope to keep ours low-commitment and low-cost, in a casual setting. In addition, we do not want to restrict ourselves to only tutorials 

LOCAL ENGAGEMENT WITH CURRENT ISSUES - Similar to above, but more suited to formal and informal discussion, KLEUR will be the host site of many salons and discussions regarding current and ongoing social issues, both specific and general: Racial equity, Humans and their relationship to Empathy, Gender equality, socio-economic disparity, the state of public education in North Carolina, upcoming election and political issues, clean water, at-risk and high-risk teens, the death (or rise) of art, and on and on and on...

 NETWORKING AND VISIBILITY FOR OUR MAKERS (and WSNC)
We mentioned already that our commission rate is much lower than other shops like ours (made possible by donors like you), but the added HUGE benefit to the makers who have their work in KLEUR is the increase in their visibility! Here's putting it simply: by digitally connecting with hundreds of shops similar to ours on forums like Instagram, we are interacting daily with owners and patrons of like-shops in cities like San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, New York, Boston, Chicago, Nashville, Richmond, and so forth. We ""like"" their photos, they ""like"" ours (it sounds trite, but hang on a minute here), and inevitably perhaps WE see a product for sale in their shop that we have to have. We contact the maker via Instagram. We ask them for a Wholesale order, and BAM, Jewelry Maker for Melting Sun Apparel from Atlanta, GA is in KLEUR (this is a true story...this is exactly how we have snagged many of our out-of-town makers)...Well, the same is true on the flip side. Say a shop in California sees a local WSNC maker's work on our feed. They contact him/her directly. Wholesale order. Suddenly a WSNC has their work in a shop across the country, and the orders keep on coming. 
If this seems like a fairy tale, we assure you it is not. We have done our homework on this incredible phenomenon called Social Media and what it can do instantly for a hand-crafter's career.
The reality: if we do this well, and continue to be as networked as we potentially will be in this maker-lifestyle movement, we can add to the appeal of Winston Salem on the world stage as a hub for arts and innovation. 



Future KLEUR Endeavors...
TOOL-SHARE PROGRAM  -  A major future goal of ours, we have already started collecting and storing a vast arrangement of gently used hand tools, including presses, vices, awls, files, mallets, saws, and the like. We are working to develop a tool-share program, where members can come to us, exchange a token, and rent a tool for free for as long as they need it. 
MAKER and ART SUPPLIES - As time goes on and networks improve, we hope to eventually offer a selection of choice pigments, canvas, brushes, solvents, other mediums, textiles and fibers, and additional supplies. 
KLEUR PRESS - 
ARTIST RESIDENCIES: In the future, we hope to grow enough to offer residencies for out-of-town artists to come and collaborate with locals and build a body of work that reflects this innovation. We need your help to get started.

<li>You're investing in sustainable tourism.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Immediate Outcomes</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Full time wages for 17 people for one year</li>
<li>Steady employment for land mine victims who in many cases are otherwise unemployable</li>

<li>Promotion of peace and reconciliation through storytelling</li>
<li>The ability to engage experts that can provide counselling in post traumatic stress syndrome</li>
</ol>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>Cambodia, or as most locals still fondly refer to it,
“Kampuchea” named after the French colonial rule, lies sandwiched between
redefined borders once belonging to the Ancient Angkor Empire, now divided into
Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. </p>
<p>“As rich as a Cambodian” goes the old Chinese saying - as
the region was rich in water and alluvial silt from the Mekong River and could
yield up to 3 rice crops a year, with fresh fruit and fish in abundance. In the
‘60’s Cambodia was described as the “Pearl” of Asia with a modern Western rock
culture and an envy of many developing South East Asian Countries.</p>
<p>Caught up as a political pawn in the Vietnam War,
Cambodia spiralled into 30 years of civil war and a genocide program under the
Pol Pot regime that saw an estimated 2 million of the country’s educated people
exterminated.</p>
<p>Peace finally came in 1999 with the capitulation of
the Khmer Rouge, but the country is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of an educated generation. Heavily mined by all sides of the conflict, people are still suffering today from the effects of land mines, the “perfect soldiers”. An
estimated 6 million mines remain undetected.</p>
<p>Angkor Wat was listed as a UNESCO world heritage site
in 1992 and since then the tourist growth has been phenomenal.</p>
<p>Many people come to visit the temples, but have a very
vague knowledge as to the suffering that is ongoing as a result of the
war. </p>
<p>Cambodia is now one of the poorest countries in South East Asia with the vast
majority of the population living on the poverty line of $2/day.</p>
<p>Despite the hardship, Cambodians are a resilient and
happy people, just getting on with life.</p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Summary</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This interactive social enterprise is about making a
difference through storytelling, building better relationships with tourists and
engaging local Cambodians.</span><br/></p>
<div>
<p>This isn’t about a short-term bandaid. It’s about coming alongside a group of land mine survivors who are passionately committed to earning a living while
educating others about their history. They need your help to begin this journey to meaningful, sustainable work  that will impact the healing taking place in their beloved and beleaguered country. </p>
<p>It’s about telling stories about Cambodia’s past,
but even more importantly about shaping its future. </p>
<p>The Cambodia War Remnant Museum was a former
battlefield and holds a unique value for the guides and the local Cambodians
living nearby. Many artifacts on display at the museum were found while
constructing the site. </p>
<p>It’s located a few kilometres from the temples of
Angkor Wat and the guides want to share their story
about Cambodian culture, and Cambodia's difficult and
violent past with you and they want to educate a younger generation about
an empowered future full of hope and opportunity. </p>
<p>Visitors to the Museum will not only help to sustain the war veterans and land mine victims but will also help to provide basic needs such as fresh water, education and essential medical supplies to their immediate families and friends living within the grounds of the museum. A community approach.<br/></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We need 12 months of start up
capital and operational funding to get the museum off the ground. </span><br/></p>
<p>This will allow the guides to build
their business one tourist at a time. </p>
<p>The location is minutes away from
the world renewed temples of Angkor Wat where over 2.5 million tourists come visit
year from around the world. </p>
<p>Can you see the potential? </p>
<p>The impact is far reaching. The
financial opportunity for growth is huge. It really is so multi-layered.</p>
<p>Your money will fund 4 distinct line
items:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">17 Staff at $100 per month each
for a grand total of $1700. Yes that’s only $1700 to keep 17 people employed. (comparable local wage)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Water and transportation @ $2.50/
day = $75/month</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Food for staff @ $5.00/day = $150/month</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Administration, Fundraising and
Marketing @ 2.50/day = $75/month</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Total: $2,000/month</p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</b><br/></p>
<p>The greatest risk for the museum is
that they may be forced to close before they are 'discovered' by tourists.</p>
<p>There is a lot of competition for
the tourist dollar in Siem Reap, but we believe that the War Remnant Museum just needs time to get the word out and they will become a 'must-see' stop in a visit to Angkor Wat.</p>
<p>The marketing has begun.</p>

<p>Social media attention is growing. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>The first way you can help is COME AND VISIT!!!!</p>
<p>Please also help us get word on the
street about this campaign, but more importantly about the Museum itself. </p>
<p>Ultimately the goal is to get to the
point of at least 25 visitors per day. That's it. Not only will this cover
operational costs, but will give the museum the opportunity to grow and further develop their social program. </p>

The Impact
The Impact of this project will run deep.

You’re investing in people.
You’re investing in a country.
You’re investing in a rich, unique business and cultural expression.
You're investing in sustainable tourism.

Immediate Outcomes

Full time wages for 17 people for one year
Steady employment for land mine victims who in many cases are otherwise unemployable
Better access for tourists to a greater understanding of Cambodian history.
The creation of a training centre to link with other local, like-minded organizations to create greater change in the community
Promotion of peace and reconciliation through storytelling
The ability to engage experts that can provide counselling in post traumatic stress syndrome

History
Cambodia, or as most locals still fondly refer to it,
“Kampuchea” named after the French colonial rule, lies sandwiched between
redefined borders once belonging to the Ancient Angkor Empire, now divided into
Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. 
“As rich as a Cambodian” goes the old Chinese saying - as
the region was rich in water and alluvial silt from the Mekong River and could
yield up to 3 rice crops a year, with fresh fruit and fish in abundance. In the
‘60’s Cambodia was described as the “Pearl” of Asia with a modern Western rock
culture and an envy of many developing South East Asian Countries.
Caught up as a political pawn in the Vietnam War,
Cambodia spiralled into 30 years of civil war and a genocide program under the
Pol Pot regime that saw an estimated 2 million of the country’s educated people
exterminated.
Peace finally came in 1999 with the capitulation of
the Khmer Rouge, but the country is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of an educated generation. Heavily mined by all sides of the conflict, people are still suffering today from the effects of land mines, the “perfect soldiers”. An
estimated 6 million mines remain undetected.
Angkor Wat was listed as a UNESCO world heritage site
in 1992 and since then the tourist growth has been phenomenal.
Many people come to visit the temples, but have a very
vague knowledge as to the suffering that is ongoing as a result of the
war. 
Cambodia is now one of the poorest countries in South East Asia with the vast
majority of the population living on the poverty line of $2/day.
Despite the hardship, Cambodians are a resilient and
happy people, just getting on with life.


Summary
This interactive social enterprise is about making a
difference through storytelling, building better relationships with tourists and
engaging local Cambodians.

This isn’t about a short-term bandaid. It’s about coming alongside a group of land mine survivors who are passionately committed to earning a living while
educating others about their history. They need your help to begin this journey to meaningful, sustainable work  that will impact the healing taking place in their beloved and beleaguered country. 
It’s about telling stories about Cambodia’s past,
but even more importantly about shaping its future. 
The Cambodia War Remnant Museum was a former
battlefield and holds a unique value for the guides and the local Cambodians
living nearby. Many artifacts on display at the museum were found while
constructing the site. 
It’s located a few kilometres from the temples of
Angkor Wat and the guides want to share their story
about Cambodian culture, and Cambodia's difficult and
violent past with you and they want to educate a younger generation about
an empowered future full of hope and opportunity. 
Visitors to the Museum will not only help to sustain the war veterans and land mine victims but will also help to provide basic needs such as fresh water, education and essential medical supplies to their immediate families and friends living within the grounds of the museum. A community approach.
What We Need & What You Get
We need 12 months of start up
capital and operational funding to get the museum off the ground. 
This will allow the guides to build
their business one tourist at a time. 
The location is minutes away from
the world renewed temples of Angkor Wat where over 2.5 million tourists come visit
year from around the world. 
Can you see the potential? 
The impact is far reaching. The
financial opportunity for growth is huge. It really is so multi-layered.
Your money will fund 4 distinct line
items:


17 Staff at $100 per month each
for a grand total of $1700. Yes that’s only $1700 to keep 17 people employed. (comparable local wage)
Water and transportation @ $2.50/
day = $75/month

Food for staff @ $5.00/day = $150/month


Administration, Fundraising and
Marketing @ 2.50/day = $75/month


Total: $2,000/month
Risks & Challenges
The greatest risk for the museum is
that they may be forced to close before they are 'discovered' by tourists.
There is a lot of competition for
the tourist dollar in Siem Reap, but we believe that the War Remnant Museum just needs time to get the word out and they will become a 'must-see' stop in a visit to Angkor Wat.
The marketing has begun.
The website is up. www.warrmc.com
Social media attention is growing. 
Other Ways You Can Help
The first way you can help is COME AND VISIT!!!!
Please also help us get word on the
street about this campaign, but more importantly about the Museum itself. 
Ultimately the goal is to get to the
point of at least 25 visitors per day. That's it. Not only will this cover
operational costs, but will give the museum the opportunity to grow and further develop their social program.

</h1><p><span>Many people today are suffering from back pain possibly due
to poor posture.  Extended periods of time sitting puts more pressure on
joints, making breathing more difficult, and can lead to back and neck
problems. As a person becomes weaker and is not able to sit up-right, the
upper body may begin to lean to the side causing the spine to be out of
alignment.</span></p>
<p>This is a great concern for the individual as well as for
caregivers.  As my mother became less social and was experiencing more
pain, the search was on to find something other than pillows and rolled up
towels to give her support and enable her to sit up-right.  </p>
<p>My mother had a contagious smile that you could not help but return.  As she became weaker and her pain increased, she
began to lose that beautiful smile.  It
saddened me to see my mother in so much pain. 
I knew I needed to do something to try and ease her pain. One day I
thought of a solution that might help and began drafting it on paper.  After several trials I created the perfect
design.  I wanted something that would
give her support without being too hard or restricting.  It had to be strong enough to enable her to
sit up-right yet still be comfortable.  After
several trials I created the perfect design.</p>
<p>Almost immediately Mother’s pain had improved and her contagious smile
was back.  The added support improved her
breathing, digestion, spinal alignment and overall comfort.  For 18 precious months my mother was happier
and could sit with dignity again.  I like
to call it a comfort system because mother had rheumatoid arthritis her entire
life and my design provided her comfort and safety and helped lessen the pain
she was feeling.  It was thrilling   to see
the amazing improvement in her quality of life.</p>
<p>I was heartbroken when my Mother passed away, but I knew that I must
strive to help others like I was able to help my mother. I knew in my heart
that I would be able to help so many others with the same product I used to
improve my mother’s final years. </p>
<p>When my childhood friend, Ron Sutton, saw the how much it helped mother,
he helped me to manufacture the product. 
With his knowledge of textiles and my design, the Acme Posture Partner
was created.</p>
<p>The word acme means “the best” and we felt our product would provide the
best support to those in need, so we gave the name Acme Posture Partner to our
product.  My mother’s name was Bonnie Hall;
therefore, our company name is Hall International, named after my mother.  </p>
<p>It is heartwarming to see the improvement in the quality of life with
this very simple yet versatile and restraint-free product.  The Acme Posture Partner may be used in most
any chair, bed, vehicle and RV for added support, positioning and comfort.  Over time, we have found there are extended
uses to support the head, neck, lumbar, arms and knees.  It can provide comfort for children and
adults with special needs, it may provide infant safety, and is especially
comfortable for anyone falling asleep in a car.</p>
<p>Together we can help provide a better quality of life for those in
need.  With your contribution we can all
feel a sense of joy by providing the Acme Posture Partner to anyone of any age needing
additional comfort.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for helping us to reach our goal.  We appreciate you sharing Acme Posture
Partner’s crowdfunding efforts with your family and friends.</p>
<h1>Why we need you!</h1>
<p>We’ve
turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you and to individuals around the
world.  There are many people living in
the world today who suffer due to age, muscular diseases, and injuries. Our
goal is to raise $8,000 to get the product into the hands of people who need
the support system. Your funding will help make this possible.  Help us spread the joy of comfort this holiday
season by contributing. </p>
<p>You can
also help us by spreading the word about Acme Posture Partner.  The more people that know about this product,
the more men, women and children we will be able to help.  As contributions come in, products will be
shipped to an individual in need.  Early
contributions will allow products to be received by Christmas.</p>

<p><b>Sue Chambliss R.N., Texas</b></p>
<blockquote>“Ms. Childress’s mother would lean to one side or slide down in her
chair throughout the day.  There was no
one way to align her body with pillows, they would slip or be the wrong size. Since
the Posture Partner, Ms. Childress made her mother, it is easy to get good body
alignment most of the time.  Her mother
is doing better now that many of her aches have lessened.  She is talking more and generally happier
since the Posture Partner has been in use.” </blockquote>
<p><b>Tom McCann</b></p>
<blockquote>“I wanted
to take this opportunity to let you know what a blessing it has been for my Mother since we acquired the
“Posture Partner”.  It has made such a
dramatic difference in the quality of life which my Mom experience as a nursing
home resident. She no longer has to endure the constant difficulty of trying to
maintain a comfortable and upright posture while occupying her wheelchair
during the day.  And no more sore, stiff
neck after awakening from an afternoon nap in front of the TV.  In fact, my Mother’s disposition and attitude
have experienced a very noticeable improvement since acquiring the Posture
Partner. I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend the Posture Partner to
anyone who has a family member or loved one that is in need of a product that
would enable them to maintain a comfortable and upright position while
occupying a wheelchair.”</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>Holden Hronek, LVN, Texas </b></p>
<blockquote>“This
product not only provides postural support, but allows patient to participate
in socializing, promotes nutritional intake, and does so without being
restrictive to patient.  This system
allows patient to have a higher quality of life as well as improving comfort
and posture.  There is a trend of
Facilities striving to be “Restraint Free”. 
This system could be instrumental in achieving this goal while assisting
patients with postural deficits. I strongly recommend this product.” </blockquote>
<p><b>Juanita Brown, PT, Park Plaza Nursing and
Rehabilitation</b></p>
<blockquote>“I hope
you all try these products in your long term care settings.  These devices are practical, economical and
produce very dignified seating environments. 
Our facility has had improved sitting postures with reduction of skin
breakdown and improved postures for safer swallowing.  Give them a try, you will be hooked.”</blockquote>
<p><b>Shanna Zertuche, LVN/Alzheimer’s Unit
Director, Creative Solutions</b></p>
<blockquote>“It is
very difficult to keep residents positioned properly as they age and health
declines-i.e. weakness to back, neck, and extremities.  With the Acme Posture Partner, this resident
sits in an appropriate upright position and is comfortable in her chair when
she was leaning to the side, causing pain and difficulty eating.  I think this device is wonderful and would
benefit so many other people, greatly improving quality of life, which is our
main goal!”</blockquote>
<p><b>Lawana Stevens, Scott &amp; White Home
Care/Hospice Executive Assistant</b></p>
<blockquote>“I wanted
you to know the recent patient we are using it on, works wonderfully. We have
an assisted living that really likes them for our patients.”</blockquote>
<p><b>Tyrone, Charge Nurse, Ballinger, TX</b></p>
<blockquote>“Since
implementation of Acme support device, resident has had significant increase in
appetite.  I believe that this is
related to ease of positioning while being fed. 
Presence of “would-be” decubitus pressure areas have improved.  I recommend the usage of the Acme Posture
Partner support device in the geriatric patient.”</blockquote><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1097617/files/20141215082511-uses-photo.jpg?1418660711"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

</h3><p>There are 41.4 million people age 65 or older in the United States. In 2060 that number is projected to be 92 million. As our life span continues to increase and the elderly population grows we are seeing a larger need for products such as the Acme Posture Partner.  Dr. Ben
Rubin, M.D. orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine legend states “the core
stability is the ability to stabilize your spinal column against gravity.  Posture seems to affect the health and
well-being of every cell and every system in your body.”</p>
<p>According
to the Spine Institute, “While millions of individuals suffer from chronic neck
or back pain, many are unable to find the source of their discomfort.  If a doctor has ruled out a spine condition
such as spinal arthritis, degenerative disc disease, or sciatica, poor posture
may be to blame.  Maintaining a good
sitting posture can not only help to improve your appearance but it can also
alleviate pain in the neck and back.”

breathing, digestion, spinal alignment and overall comfort.  For 18 precious months my mother was happier
and could sit with dignity again.  I like
to call it a comfort system because mother had rheumatoid arthritis her entire
life and my design provided her comfort and safety and helped lessen the pain
she was feeling.  It was thrilling   to see
the amazing improvement in her quality of life.
I was heartbroken when my Mother passed away, but I knew that I must
strive to help others like I was able to help my mother. I knew in my heart
that I would be able to help so many others with the same product I used to
improve my mother’s final years. 
When my childhood friend, Ron Sutton, saw the how much it helped mother,
he helped me to manufacture the product. 
With his knowledge of textiles and my design, the Acme Posture Partner
was created.
The word acme means “the best” and we felt our product would provide the
best support to those in need, so we gave the name Acme Posture Partner to our
product.  My mother’s name was Bonnie Hall;
therefore, our company name is Hall International, named after my mother.  
It is heartwarming to see the improvement in the quality of life with
this very simple yet versatile and restraint-free product.  The Acme Posture Partner may be used in most
any chair, bed, vehicle and RV for added support, positioning and comfort.  Over time, we have found there are extended
uses to support the head, neck, lumbar, arms and knees.  It can provide comfort for children and
adults with special needs, it may provide infant safety, and is especially
comfortable for anyone falling asleep in a car.
Together we can help provide a better quality of life for those in
need.  With your contribution we can all
feel a sense of joy by providing the Acme Posture Partner to anyone of any age needing
additional comfort.
Thank you in advance for helping us to reach our goal.  We appreciate you sharing Acme Posture
Partner’s crowdfunding efforts with your family and friends.
Why we need you!
We’ve
turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you and to individuals around the
world.  There are many people living in
the world today who suffer due to age, muscular diseases, and injuries. Our
goal is to raise $8,000 to get the product into the hands of people who need
the support system. Your funding will help make this possible.  Help us spread the joy of comfort this holiday
season by contributing. 
You can
also help us by spreading the word about Acme Posture Partner.  The more people that know about this product,
the more men, women and children we will be able to help.  As contributions come in, products will be
shipped to an individual in need.  Early
contributions will allow products to be received by Christmas.
Please feel free to contact us with suggestions of individuals in need at susan@hallllc.com
Testimonials
Sue Chambliss R.N., Texas
“Ms. Childress’s mother would lean to one side or slide down in her
chair throughout the day.  There was no
one way to align her body with pillows, they would slip or be the wrong size. Since
the Posture Partner, Ms. Childress made her mother, it is easy to get good body
alignment most of the time.  Her mother
is doing better now that many of her aches have lessened.  She is talking more and generally happier
since the Posture Partner has been in use.” 
Tom McCann
“I wanted
to take this opportunity to let you know what a blessing it has been for my Mother since we acquired the
“Posture Partner”.  It has made such a
dramatic difference in the quality of life which my Mom experience as a nursing
home resident. She no longer has to endure the constant difficulty of trying to
maintain a comfortable and upright posture while occupying her wheelchair
during the day.  And no more sore, stiff
neck after awakening from an afternoon nap in front of the TV.  In fact, my Mother’s disposition and attitude
have experienced a very noticeable improvement since acquiring the Posture
Partner. I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly recommend the Posture Partner to
anyone who has a family member or loved one that is in need of a product that
would enable them to maintain a comfortable and upright position while
occupying a wheelchair.”

Holden Hronek, LVN, Texas 
“This
product not only provides postural support, but allows patient to participate
in socializing, promotes nutritional intake, and does so without being
restrictive to patient.  This system
allows patient to have a higher quality of life as well as improving comfort
and posture.  There is a trend of
Facilities striving to be “Restraint Free”. 
This system could be instrumental in achieving this goal while assisting
patients with postural deficits. I strongly recommend this product.” 
Juanita Brown, PT, Park Plaza Nursing and
Rehabilitation
“I hope
you all try these products in your long term care settings.  These devices are practical, economical and
produce very dignified seating environments. 
Our facility has had improved sitting postures with reduction of skin
breakdown and improved postures for safer swallowing.  Give them a try, you will be hooked.”
Shanna Zertuche, LVN/Alzheimer’s Unit
Director, Creative Solutions
“It is
very difficult to keep residents positioned properly as they age and health
declines-i.e. weakness to back, neck, and extremities.  With the Acme Posture Partner, this resident
sits in an appropriate upright position and is comfortable in her chair when
she was leaning to the side, causing pain and difficulty eating.  I think this device is wonderful and would
benefit so many other people, greatly improving quality of life, which is our
main goal!”
Lawana Stevens, Scott & White Home
Care/Hospice Executive Assistant
“I wanted
you to know the recent patient we are using it on, works wonderfully. We have
an assisted living that really likes them for our patients.”
Tyrone, Charge Nurse, Ballinger, TX
“Since
implementation of Acme support device, resident has had significant increase in
appetite.  I believe that this is
related to ease of positioning while being fed. 
Presence of “would-be” decubitus pressure areas have improved.  I recommend the usage of the Acme Posture
Partner support device in the geriatric patient.”
The Impact on Your Health 

There are 41.4 million people age 65 or older in the United States. In 2060 that number is projected to be 92 million. As our life span continues to increase and the elderly population grows we are seeing a larger need for products such as the Acme Posture Partner.  Dr. Ben
Rubin, M.D. orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine legend states “the core
stability is the ability to stabilize your spinal column against gravity.  Posture seems to affect the health and
well-being of every cell and every system in your body.”
According
to the Spine Institute, “While millions of individuals suffer from chronic neck
or back pain, many are unable to find the source of their discomfort.  If a doctor has ruled out a spine condition
such as spinal arthritis, degenerative disc disease, or sciatica, poor posture
may be to blame.  Maintaining a good
sitting posture can not only help to improve your appearance but it can also
alleviate pain in the neck and back.” 
The lesser-known benefits of good posture include: easier breathing,
healthier joints, and better concentration.Specifications of the Acme Posture Partner

<p><b><u>How We Got Here</u></b></p>
<p>It’s funny how when you get older you start to think about all
the things you wanted to do but didn't. In our case, Robin &amp; I had long
tossed around various business ideas --but they just never felt quite right. That
all changed the two summers ago. When on vacation we wandered into a quaint popcorn shop to grab our
favorite snack. As we munched away during the ride home we realized that a gourmet popcorn
company would be an awesome addition to the Ithaca community. While the popcorn we were eating was good we knew we could improve upon it; a line of gourmet popcorn that wasn’t filled with GMOs, corn syrup, artificial colors, or preservatives. In addition, we realized we could lend support to other small businesses by
sourcing some of our ingredients locally. </p>
<p>Whenever I smell popcorn, my mind goes back to helping my
mom make massive amounts of popcorn that literally filled two brown paper
grocery sacks for a night at the drive-in movies. I still fondly remember giggling under the stars with my brothers and sister as we happily munched on popcorn waiting for the movie to begin. We hope our popcorn
will stir these types of memories in others, as well as help create new memories.</p>
<p>As our idea developed, I began researching everything
I could about the gourmet popcorn industry. Next, I gathered recipes, and then the easy
part came: recruiting taste tasters! I knew we had finally turned the
corner when our tasters began asking to purchase their favorite popcorn flavor. I retired
in January 2016 to devote all my time &amp; energy to find a production site - something
that had eluded us for over a year. I'm happy to report we signed a lease
for a shared kitchen 10 days ago.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Our Mission:</u></strong></p>
<p>Yes, all businesses need a mission statement and ours definitely reflects our quirky senses of humor. Our mission is to save you from tutti-freaky,

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our story is simple: boy meets girl, girl
is mean to boy, they start dating, girl gets cancer and they decide to start
their own social good enterprise after realizing that life is short and
fragile. It’s a vision dreamt up by Bo Hammond, a former history major and
DC tour guide, and his cancer fighting, business guru girlfriend Lisa
Maurer.  </p>
<p>Ever since Lisa’s battle
with cancer, we wanted to do something meaningful to fight the disease and make
the world better in general. We’re avid fundraisers, raising money for
charities such as the American Cancer Society and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. We want to find a way to make giving core to our life. Why should helping people be part
time? We shouldn’t be forced to separate any of our life’s ambitions, whether
they be personal, professional, or philanthropic. We want to give every day of our
lives. The more we give, the more we live.  </p>
<p>In that spirit, we decided
to combine our passions of history, business, and giving to create a social
enterprise. Tours for Humanity uses history to help people. We provide walking
tours of Washington, DC such as the National Mall, Arlington Cemetery, Capitol
Hill and many more. At the end of the year our company donates a portion of profits to charities combating ignorance, poverty and disease. Every part of
our company, right down to our uniforms, does good in the world. Our goal is to
help people and make money doing it. It’s a way to address two essential needs
with an action that unifies them both. </p>
<p>We’ve put together a talented team of
teachers, history buffs and MBAs. With some hard work, Lisa’s business savvy,
and more importantly your support, we can make a real difference.</p>
<p>We need to raise $18,000 to get our
company started. This capital will enable us to cover our initial start up
costs, from strategic marketing campaigns to DC guide licenses. </p>

campaign, share our story on social media, and come on a tour.</p>

<h3>Why should I help? </h3>
<div>
<p>Help us help the world. By
helping us achieve our goal, you are contributing to a social enterprise that
measures success in the amount of good it creates, not just profits. In fact, we
pledge to contribute a portion of our profits to three charities, including the <a href=""www.lls.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</a> and <a href=""www.ashoka.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ashoka</a>. As a perk, our third charity will be chosen by a vote
from our top donors. We believe that our supporters should be rewarded with the
choice of what global cause we support. At the end of every year this third charity will rotate and a new one will be chosen by our community.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We
don’t stop there. Every part of our supply chain, right down to our uniforms,
does good. We are striving to meet rigorous standards of social performance,
accountability, and transparency to attain B-Corp certification, which is a certification
from the nonprofit B Lab. Where feasible, our supply chain will be sustainable
and fair trade. We will start with our uniform for good, where each product
purchased provides a social benefit to the world. </p>

<p><b>“Bo
knows DC”</b></p>
<p>Our guide, Bo, couldn't have been nicer,
friendlier, more knowledgeable, and more patient/humorous with the kids
peppering him with questions! Walking pace is easy enough, and the kind of
unofficial info passed along really enhanced the tour. </p>
<p><b>""Bo
soldiered on and didn't let the rain shorten our experience""</b></p>
<p>On Friday night we did the Monuments Tour
with Bo. He was engaging, very knowledgeable, and very genuine. The tour was
well paced. It started pouring rain with about 45 minutes to go- but Bo
soldiered on- and didn't let the rain shorten our experience. (Even though he
was getting wet- after he kindly let some of our fellow tourists use his
umbrella that he had brought along!)</p>
<p><b>“I
am learning stories that I didn’t even know”</b></p>
<p>I teach at a high school in the Bronx. I
am here on this tour today and it has been absolutely fantastic. The tour guide
has been extremely informative. I have been teaching U.S. history and
government for the last five years and I am learning stories that I didn’t even
know. I’m going to take them back to the classroom. It’s been fantastic and the
kids have loved it. It’s funny. It’s engaging. They have had plenty of
time to see all of the exhibits and all of the monuments. It’s just been a
blast! </p>
<p><b>“Our
guide Bo, was a history grad and it showed!”</b></p>
<p>For a city teeming with rich history, a
guided tour was a must-do for a history buff like me. Our guide Bo, was a
history grad and it showed! At every memorial/monument, we were treated to it's
fascinating back story, and those of the great men and women who've been
honored there. It was a bleak rainy day, but Bo kept us in good cheer with
his narration, interspersed with funny and interesting historical anecdotes. Overall
highly recommended.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1156200/files/20150117202323-Screen_Shot_2014-11-04_at_10.00.14_PM.png?1421555003"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<div>
<h3>Are there any risks? </h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>We’d be lying if we said there
weren’t any risks. There is the potential that tourists will not care if their
tour helps people or not. We believe that people are inherently good and that
given the chance to help others they will.  Building a startup is full of
challenges and it might fail, but the world will spin on.  If we
succeed then we can do our part to improve the world for years to come. 
We have a year to lose or everything to gain. As Franklin Roosevelt wrote,
“The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.”</p><p></p><h3>Who are your guides? </h3>
<p>Our guides are passionate about
history, educated and want to make the world just a little
better. </p><p>

Hotel, Star Saloon, US Treasury Building   Are our tours any good?   

No. They’re *!$%ing great!
We’ve already given a few tours and here’s what people are saying about us: 
“Bo
knows DC”
Our guide, Bo, couldn't have been nicer,
friendlier, more knowledgeable, and more patient/humorous with the kids
peppering him with questions! Walking pace is easy enough, and the kind of
unofficial info passed along really enhanced the tour. 
""Bo
soldiered on and didn't let the rain shorten our experience""
On Friday night we did the Monuments Tour
with Bo. He was engaging, very knowledgeable, and very genuine. The tour was
well paced. It started pouring rain with about 45 minutes to go- but Bo
soldiered on- and didn't let the rain shorten our experience. (Even though he
was getting wet- after he kindly let some of our fellow tourists use his
umbrella that he had brought along!)
“I
am learning stories that I didn’t even know”
I teach at a high school in the Bronx. I
am here on this tour today and it has been absolutely fantastic. The tour guide
has been extremely informative. I have been teaching U.S. history and
government for the last five years and I am learning stories that I didn’t even
know. I’m going to take them back to the classroom. It’s been fantastic and the
kids have loved it. It’s funny. It’s engaging. They have had plenty of
time to see all of the exhibits and all of the monuments. It’s just been a
blast! 
“Our
guide Bo, was a history grad and it showed!”
For a city teeming with rich history, a
guided tour was a must-do for a history buff like me. Our guide Bo, was a
history grad and it showed! At every memorial/monument, we were treated to it's
fascinating back story, and those of the great men and women who've been
honored there. It was a bleak rainy day, but Bo kept us in good cheer with
his narration, interspersed with funny and interesting historical anecdotes. Overall
highly recommended.

Are there any risks?  

We’d be lying if we said there
weren’t any risks. There is the potential that tourists will not care if their
tour helps people or not. We believe that people are inherently good and that
given the chance to help others they will.  Building a startup is full of
challenges and it might fail, but the world will spin on.  If we
succeed then we can do our part to improve the world for years to come. 
We have a year to lose or everything to gain. As Franklin Roosevelt wrote,
“The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.”Who are your guides? 
Our guides are passionate about
history, educated and want to make the world just a little
better.",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

I have my Bachelor's of Urban Planning &amp; Design and I am currently pursuing my Master's of Community Development while in Peace Corps. Since arriving here I have been shown the town through the locals eyes and how fickle the government is in implementing social service projects. I am fortunate to have my friend Abderrahmane Ait Lqous (Bachelor of Sociology of Enterprise) guide me through how bureaucracy works in Morocco.</p>
<p>I have been working with locals, students and associations on how to solve the current environmental issue in Tameslohte, Morocco. The initial plan was to address the trash management problem in our town. Thanks to the funding we were able to stir up enough talk that the local government beat us to the punch; installing 15 trash cans in the center of town. However, it was ill planned and there is no policy set in place. Fortunately, they are now asking for help to create a long term waste management policy. We are working on this now. Thank you for all your support!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Plan</h3> <p></p>As promised, the excess funds are being used for projects  associated with our Environmental Club. These projects will include buying trash bags, gloves and transport of trash with our <b>trash pick-ups</b>/Buying paint and materials for implementing <b>environmental murals</b> throughout town/Gathering craft materials for executing <b>educational environmental projects</b> within local schools/orphanage which we will rotate throughout every month. <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Since our local government has finally done something about our trash can company simply from word of mouth of our recent trash can project we are going to continue pushing the envelope.</div>
<div>We started with one of the largest project ideas ever and it is starting to unravel in front of our eyes. Now, this isn't a project to say, ""Ope! Great! Did my deed, now I can go!"" The most important key in community development is sustainability. Meaning, what keys can you leave to easily open the locks to resources left behind.</div>
<div>We plan to implement this not only through pick-ups, murals, and projects but also something more tangible such as workshops. We will create step by step tool-kits in english and Moroccan arabic. For incoming volunteers and Moroccans. These will include, but not limited to, Project Design Management/CV &amp; Resume Building/Personal Marketing &amp; Design/Environmental Club Projects/Project Fundraising and others if need-be.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As any project entails there is always the risk of participation. For our Environmental Club it is our initiative to bring in students, associations and stakeholders to support our projects. </p>
<p>Currently, there is an attempt to establish a You Council on the local Commune Board. This will act as an adversary to projects and ideas created by the underrepresented youth in our town.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is working with the local government. Our local government is corrupt, like most small towns in developing countries. They only give project money to those who are willing to vote for them. Fortunately, for establishing a youth council we will have a voice on the commune board. With adequate support from resources such indiegogo and creating a project proposal It just comes down to their support. </p>
<p>This is why I prefer to use crowdfunding sites to fundraise for my projects while here because 1) It helps streamline the process of completing projects. 2) The local government will approve anything if they don't have to pay for it.</p>
<p><b>Monthly Trash Pickups: </b>400 DH = 43 $</p>
<p><b>One Mural: </b>1000 DH = 106 $</p>
<p><b>Monthly Educational Projects: </b> 350 DH = 37 $</p>
<p>The reason I have made this a continuously running campaign is because  this doesn't end at on project or mural but is more powered by the people pushing for these changes. I know the potential is here and I am ready to establish the project competency here.</p>

<p>Depuis 2010, le Gisement tempère du chocolat afin de perfectionner cet art et d’en faire un produit fin. Le tempérage du chocolat est la base de la création du chocolatier. Pour un volume important, un espace adéquat prêt à accueillir l’équipement spécialisé est nécessaire. <br/></p>
<p>Le 57 rue Principale répondra à ce standard en nous permettant une production à la hauteur de la demande. D'importantes sommes seront investis pour l’équipement, l’aménagement, les moules professionnels, les accessoires et le système de contrôle de la température de cette pièce.</p>
<p>Aidez nous à mettre en marche notre
laboratoire en nous encourageant sur place ou par le biais de cette campagne de

<br/><p></p></div>","Ce n’est plus un secret, afin d’élever d’un cran son potentiel de service, le Gisement Bistro-chocolaterie déménage. Bien que nous misions sur une recette familière et déjà appréciée par notre clientèle, le Gisement raffinera son art de travailler et de marier les délices du chocolat dans un tout nouvel établissement.
Nous prévoyons vous accueillir dans notre nouvel environnement dès juin, au 57 avenue Principale.Vous y retrouverez une boutique renouvelée et foisonnante de produits et un point de vue sur la raison d’être du déménagement : le laboratoire de chocolats.En plus, avec des heures d'ouverture prolongées, un menu novateur, un service de bières en fût et une nouvelle ambiance engageante, le bistro saura, nous l’espérons, vous charmer et consolider votre appétit pour les petites voluptés.  

>> Consultez le plan du futur établissement






Depuis 2010, le Gisement tempère du chocolat afin de perfectionner cet art et d’en faire un produit fin. Le tempérage du chocolat est la base de la création du chocolatier. Pour un volume important, un espace adéquat prêt à accueillir l’équipement spécialisé est nécessaire. 
Le 57 rue Principale répondra à ce standard en nous permettant une production à la hauteur de la demande. D'importantes sommes seront investis pour l’équipement, l’aménagement, les moules professionnels, les accessoires et le système de contrôle de la température de cette pièce.
Aidez nous à mettre en marche notre
laboratoire en nous encourageant sur place ou par le biais de cette campagne de
financement. Toutes vos contributions de départ serviront à l’achat, à la mise en
marche et au rodage de nos appareils tout en nous assurant une première vague
de production.





Vous désirez nous aider autrement? Contribuez à la visibilité de notre projet en partageant notre page avec vos proches! Ce coup de pouce est tout autant apprécié.

<p>In business everything takes twice as long, costs twice as much and yields half the result.</p>
<p>                But sometimes the unexpected expense hits you hard when you least expect it.</p>
<p>                We are three months away from opening our Literary Themed Bed and Breakfast in Gwenyfar’s childhood home.  The renovation has been a long marathon to get here – but it has been rewarding. Last week, the downstairs A/C system died a noble death.  It gave 31 years of service.  But it went gently into that good night and has left us without climate control in July. The price tag for a new system is coming in at about $8,000.00.  Not only do we need to pay for the unit itself, the down payment has eaten up much of the capital we had set aside for the big bills on the horizon: insurance and taxes.</p>
<p>                We could pursue a bank loan, and we might still have to… however, we would rather not if at all possible.</p>
<p>                We are not asking for a donation or a hand out.</p>
<p>                We are trying to pre-sell the services of the B&amp;B, The Loft and the Tour to raise the money to finish the B&amp;B project.  Because we would rather owe our community than a bank. We would rather connect with you and give you our promise, than a bank. We would rather have a date to see you, talk with you and share our love of books, people and community, than fill out payment coupons to the bank.</p>
<p>                If you have been considering the Literary History Walking Tour or a night in The Loft, please think about it now! Do you have family coming to visit this fall? Or over the Holidays? Would you consider purchasing tickets for the Walking Tour now to have in hand for when they arrive?  Would you like to have a super awesome place for them to stay where you can play life size scrabble or chess? A place where someone else cleans and does the laundry?  Please consider us and please consider purchasing a tour or stay package now. We would really appreciate it. Thank you.</p>

<p>All funds raised will be used for the B&amp;B's A/C system.  If, by some miracle, we pre-sell more than the goal, the additional funds will go to replenish the taxes and insurance fund (not sexy, but necessary).</p>
<p>We have been steadily working on this project for over three years. We are so close to putting it all together and showing you what it can be. Please join us as we cross the finish line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But most important- please come by the bookstore and see us.  Seeing you, talking books with you, going on the Walking Tour with you, and sending you home with the book you have been looking for - those are the reasons we open the doors everyday.</p>

                                            Flash Mob 12/20/2015 Performance:
 


What We Need & What You Get  Our goal is $10,000: half to donate another 1,000 MetroCards to our Distribution Partners and half to produce MetroCard collection boxes. We are a volunteer-based organization and all net proceeds go to the cause.  Beyond the good karma of contributing to this worthy cause and helping unprivileged New Yorkers, you will also receive tangible satisfaction from our creative perks. In contributing, you have the opportunity to support not only our own efforts but those of local artists as well. We are partnering with local artists Carlos Pinto and Thomas McKean to bring you unique perks that embody our mission. Like NeXT Stop, these artists extract value from discarded MetroCards, elevating the hidden sparks within. Check out the calendar and original artwork!

  The Impact  Your contributions would help New Yorkers get back on their feet. Your support offers them hope, encourages them to keep trying, and inspires them with the knowledge that someone out there wants them to succeed. Help them get to their NeXT Stop! Every MetroCard is another opportunity.

We have already had a big impact on people's lives over the past three years and with your help we can continue. Our donors will receive update emails with video testimonials from our Distribution Partners and MetroCard recipients. We want to keep you in the loop and grow the NeXT Stop community because
the real magic happens when we do good together.



Transportation is often overlooked relative to other vital resources like food, shelter, healthcare, education, and employment, but one must be able to access those resources and transportation is the missing link. And in a city so abundant in resources like New York, physical mobility is related to social mobility. We aim to shrink the opportunity gap by focusing our efforts on the transit deficit that plagues so many New Yorkers. 
Any amount we raise will be used to buy MetroCards and collection boxes. The more we raise, the greater the impact.     Risks & Challenges.
  It can be a challenge to get businesses to agree to house a collection box. Fortunately, we have already established a footprint and our boxes are all over Manhattan. We are making progress every day and working hard to collect more MetroCards.



With enough support from the community we can overcome even the largest obstacle and show the MTA it is in their best (PR) interest to support the cause.
For a proof of concept check out FareShare DC - they have had remarkable success with a similar program in Washington DC for over a decade.


    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Want to help us place MetroCard collection boxes all over NYC or interested in volunteering somehow? Contact us via this page or our website, we will bring you aboard the NeXT Stop train! 
Whether you are a one-time NYC tourist with a leftover MetroCard or a kindhearted New Yorker who wants to help their neighbor, please mail us your MetroCards: 115 Hartsdale Avenue, White Plains, NY 10606. Americans have mailed in cards from over 20 states around the country! Every mailed-in-MetroCard brightens our day and the generosity of NYC visitors is inspiring. Check out some examples in the photo gallery. 


Share with your network to spread the good word!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our Catholic Bookstore is more than just a retail business.  It is a place to gather, grow in the faith and pass the faith on to others.</p>
<p>We are the only store in the country known to deal in both new and used Catholic books.  We provide a respectful environment for people to sell used/pre-loved Catholic Books.  Our used books allow patrons to obtain good Catholic reading material at a significant discount.</p>
<p>Our store also offers traditional Catholic gifts and handcrafted jewelry, artwork, rosaries, crucifixes, cards and handbags.  We give local artists and craftsmen a place to sell their articles to the public.</p>
<p>We support monastic societies by offering items crafted by monks/sisters.  The purchase of these items supports their charitable work and religious orders.</p>
<p>Catholic Book Exchange opened almost 5 years ago against all odds.  The economy was struggling and Amazon and other online book and gift sellers were booming.</p>
<p>When we opened there was plenty of room on the bookshelves, and hot coffee samples brewed daily.  We have greatly expanded our selection of books and gifts since we opened and we have officially run out room.</p>
<p>We are faced with sharply increasing business expenses such as rent, utilities and insurance costs.  The only way for us to remain open is to expand our inventory and services in order to increase foot traffic and sales.</p>
<p><strong>What we want to do to better serve you and our community:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a place where our customers and community can gather.</li>
<li>Provide timely access to the newest Catholic books, gifts and devotional items.</li>
<li>Help you find gifts and books that will nourish souls as well as entertain.</li>
<li>Host events like author book signings, children's story hour and book/bible study groups</li>
<li>Serve you a cup of amazing Mystic Monk Coffee and perhaps a something sweet.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have set our flexible goal at $35,000.</p>
<p><strong><i>The direction we will go is driven by the amount raised in this campaign.  So your contributions are our compass.  We would love to GROW but that would be up to you!</i></strong></p>
<p>In order to continue operating in our current space we will need to reformat the floor plan and streamline fixtures.  That is our <strong>STAY</strong> option.   If we raise $10,000 to $20,000 we will <strong>STAY</strong> in our current 1,000 sq ft space and redesign the layout and fixtures to better serve our community.  </p>
<p>How we will use the funds if we <strong>STAY</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,000 for new streamlined bookcases and floor displays.</li>
<li>$2,500 for wall display units and associated display fixtures.</li>
<li>$800-$1,000 to update lighting to improve merchandise visibility.</li>
<li>$1,000 -1,500 to cover operation expenses while closed to remodel.</li>
<li>$3,500 + for new inventory and expansion of available stock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <strong>GROW </strong>option will include moving to a new, larger space.  We would like to upgrade to a space between 2,000 &amp; 2,500 square feet.  If we raise $20,000 to $35,000 we will <strong>GROW</strong>.</p>
<p>How we will use the funds if we <strong>GROW</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>$8,000 to initiate new lease and increased rent for larger property.</li>
<li>$4,500 for new shelves and fixtures.</li>
<li>$2,000 to cover initial impact of increased insurance and utilities for larger space.</li>
<li>$1,500 for new signage.</li>
<li> $800 moving expenses.</li>
<li>$4,500 + increased inventory, selection and available stock.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, all funds raised will go to improve the store and increase our selection of books and gifts to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>Finally, if we <strong>EXCEED</strong> our goal.....</p>
<p>All additional funds will be used to place a <strong>COFFEE SHOP</strong> in our store featuring Mystic Monk Coffee!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As you may know, Catholic bookstores are few and far between.  Many of theses stores have had to close in the time we have been open.  These closings leave Catholic/Christian communities with large void.  It is our firm resolve to provide the Allen and the surrounding areas with a place to grow their faith with deep roots.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Operating any small business comes with risk.  Although Catholic bookstores are a unique breed, we recognize the threat posed by online resellers.  It is promising to hear that the American Booksellers Association reports an increase in opening of independent bookstores. We fully understand that our customers are the most valuable ingredient.   Our challenge is to reach out to our customer base and bring them into the store.  We have plans to expand our reach using social media advertising, increased direct email access and an updated web presence.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone is able to contribute financially.  We would be honored if you could help us in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help spread the word.  Use your social media, email and word of mouth to get our campaign out to as many people as possible.  </li>

</p><p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>ABOUT
ME</u></b></p>
<p>My name is Mulewa
Johychim from Uganda. I’m aged 23 (born 04/03/1993).</p>
<p>I’m in my last year at college.
I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration – Majoring in
Accounting. My college name is Bugema University (<a href=""http://www.bugemauniv.ac.ug"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bugemauniv.ac.ug</a>). I’ll be
graduating in October. I’m the last child of eight children born to my parents.
My parents are cultivators. None of my brothers and sisters got chance to reach
college. Since I’m the last child, my parents sacrificed their belongings to
meet my education requirements. They sold half of their land in the village so
they could sponsor my studies.</p>
<p><b><u>BACKROUND OF THE
BUSINESS IDEA </u></b></p>
<p>In Uganda, the rate of unemployment is
so high. 90% of the youth above 24 years are unemployed. Getting a job here in
Uganda is extremely hard. There is a lot of corruption and bribery in the
employment system. After graduating from University, many youths are lured into
bribing employers in promise of getting a job. Very many graduates end up not
getting the jobs promised to them even after bribing the employers. Every year,
tens of thousands of college graduates finish their studies. Majority of them
don’t know where to start since the jobs are not there</p>
<p>Due to the above situation, I decided to
do something. I want to start up my own business, become an entrepreneur,
employ myself and when my business/firm grows and expands, I could employ many
other youths.</p>
<p><b><u>TYPE OF BUSINESS</u></b></p>
<p>I want to start a Real Estate Business Firm
on small scale. With time, I hope it will expand and grow into a big Real
Estate Business. I have already made a survey and research about how and where I’m
going to start the business. </p>
<p>Land appreciates in value on a monthly
basis and the price of a piece of land will be much higher 6 months from now.</p>
<p><b><u>START UP CAPITAL
BUDGET</u></b></p>
<p>I will start with one plot of land, with
time, when my business firm expands; I will be dealing in both land and houses.
</p>
<p>I need a minimum start-up amount of
$2500, whereby;</p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>$1500
is to buy the Real Property (one plot of land). I will buy one plot of land in
town (Kasese Town) at $1500. I will put some innovations on the piece of
land/plot. The innovations include:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Creating
a pathway connecting the piece of land to the main road</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Extending
a water line to the piece of land</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Designing
the land (portraying where a house, garden, etc could be set up)</p>
<p>After putting the above innovations, I
would sell the plot of land at a much higher price to earn a profit which I would
again reinvest in another bigger plot of land, put the above innovations and
again sell it at a much higher price. This is possible since the price of land
in a town increases in a very short time.</p>
<p>The plot of land which I will buy at
$1500, would be sold at not less than $2000 in few months after putting the
above innovations.</p>
<p>Land in a town appreciates in value on a
monthly basis. So I’m certain my business will work out.</p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>$300
will cater rent for a small office which I would use as the center of operation.
This amount would pay for rent of 6 months period.</p>
<p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>$700
will cater for innovation expenses ($500), registering the firm with the local
government authority ($100), Publicizing and Marketing the Plot of Land ($100)</p>
<p><b>PUBLICITY AND MARKETING</b></p>
<p>-I plan to set up a small office and design a
post to indicate the name of the firm.</p>
<p>-I will make a post written on "" LAND FOR
SALE"" and put it on the piece of land. </p>
<p>-I will put announcements on a local radio to
advertise the plot.</p>
<p>-I will upload pictures of the plot on social
media to reach potential buyers. With time, I would design a website for the
firm.</p>
<p>By doing the above, I would reach many potential
buyers.</p>
<p><b>N.B</b>, In Uganda here, the value of land in
a town increases quickly. The price of a piece of land in a town here will be
much higher after few months. </p>
<p>So I'm sure I will sell the plot of land at a
higher price and earn good profit and then continue with the business of dealing
in plots of land and houses.</p>
<p><b>I call upon everyone to help me achieve this
dream. Donate any amount you can afford, however little it may be, donate it
and I will make a big change. Share my campaign with your friends, relatives,
workmates, and neighbors among others.</b></p>

<p>We are Check The Waves! </p>
<p>We are lifelong surfers and are very passionate about the ocean and measuring waves.  As all surfers do we have relied on forecasts and a scattering of NOAA buoys, mostly far offshore, to assist us in deciding when or where to surf and as we all know forecasts and distant buoy observations quite often don't match what we see when we get to the beach.  As a result our mission is to enhance the decision making capabilities of surfers, fishermen, boaters, engineers and the like by providing real-time information about the nearshore ocean conditions.</p>
<p>We currently have 4 wave buoys deployed off the east coast of Florida and the current data from these stations can be freely viewed on our website at <a href=""http://www.checkthewaves.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.checkthewaves.com</a>.  The information our buoys provide is being used by water sports enthusiasts, coastal engineers, wave forecast modellers and academia to name a few.  Our immediate goal is to install a fifth nearshore real-time wave buoy off West Palm Beach in Palm Beach County to report the actual nearshore wave conditions for the benefit of anyone who does anything on the water. </p>

<p>We are a for-profit company with a social good mission, in other words we are mission driven not profit driven.  We are looking for like minded individuals and businesses to support this mission and become part of our team!</p>

<p>We are seeking a total of $14,000 to manufacture and deploy buoy number 5.  We anticipate the costs to be as follows:</p>
<p>$3,500 - Estimated cost of perks, Indiegogo fees and payment processing fees.</p>
<p>$8,000 to build one full system including spares for wave gauge and data transmitter.</p>
<p>$2,500 for installation of anchor system and deployment of buoy, mainly boat rentals.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal the net money after perk costs and platform fees will be spent first on building buoy number 5.  What is left will go towards deployment and finally any remains will be spent on the spare equipment.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal we will use the money in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will begin to build another full system as a spare for the network.  This will enable us to react to buoy outages much quicker and cheaper.  If a buoy fails for whatever reason then without a spare we have to recover the buoy, repair it then re-deploy it which involves 2 boat trips as well as prolonged data outages.  If we have a spare system then we simply swap out buoys saving one boat trip and getting the data streaming again much quicker!</li>
<li>We will begin app development for a customizable surf alert that will be based on our real-time data.  We will be looking for beta testers once app development begins and preference will be given to registered users of Check The Waves.  So if you are interested in being a beta tester for our products or just want to be kept in the loop about news and developments go to <a href=""https://www.checkthewaves.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.checkthewaves.com</a> and register!</li>
<li>More money = more buoys!  We currently have 8 permits for buoys in various parts of Florida and have used 4 so far.  While we will continue to install buoys based on our permits if you have a preferred location for a buoy and would like to fund the installation (buoy and deployment) we can easily obtain a permit and get it going.  If you do want to fund the entire installation of a buoy please contact us directly as it would be more financially efficient that way. </li>

<p>Your contribution will help support the manufacture and deployment of our 5th wave buoy to be located off West Palm Beach in Palm Beach County.  This buoy will become the first nearshore real-time wave buoy ever located south of Martin County which is currently the location of the southern most nearshore real-time wave buoy off the East coast of Florida.  As with the other wave buoys this buoy will also provide critical decision making information to all maritime concerns.  </p>
<p>One of the more significant impacts is that we are entering a critically under-served section of Florida as described to us by several contacts inside the National Weather Service (NWS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  We have been invited by these entities to join in a proposal to install up to 5 of our buoys in the Southeastern portion of Florida to provide this critical information directly to the NWS and NOAA which will be incorporated into their forecasting and warning products as well as ongoing research.  The problem is that these proposals typically take from 1 to 2 years to receive funding once submitted and there is no guarantee the project will be funded.  The need is there now and we are trying to fill that void one buoy at a time!</p>
<p>While small, another sign of validation that the information we provide is of high quality is that the local NWS office in Melbourne, FL has included a link to our website on their website for nearby observations.  This is by no means an endorsement of Check The Waves by the NWS it simply means that they view us as a credible outlet for accurate nearshore wave information.  Regardless we are stoked to have that link!   </p>

<p>Working in the ocean is inherently a risky, challenging and expensive endeavor.  The ocean relentlessly tests your equipment 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. </p>
<p>One of the largest risks for our equipment are severe storms like hurricanes.  Recent Hurricane Matthew had the worst possible track for our current network of 4 buoys with the potential to take out the entire network in a 24 hour span.  Fortunately we only had one station suffer major damage, one minor damage and two unharmed.  Other risks include accidental boat strikes and vandalism, however to date we have not had any vandalism.  The initial version of the buoy was struck by a boat once but has since been redesigned to provide far more visibility and since then we have not had any boat strikes.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we face are the logistics and expense of operation and maintenance.  While we try to do as much field work as possible by kayak sometimes the weather is not on our side and we have to find a suitable boat to hire to get us on the water especially for initial installation and any full recovery operation.  To date we have been very fortunate to have a network of people who have been willing to provide very low cost boat trips to help us out, and we greatly appreciate them!  However, since we strive for minimal down time for our buoys we sometimes have to hire a boat to get the data streaming again as quickly as possible and this can run $1000-$2000 depending on the location, so any realistic budget must include some cost for boat rental.</p>
<p>To mitigate the risks and challenges we have designed the whole system to be as inexpensive as possible while still providing high quality information to the end user.  This greatly eases the financial burden of replacement when buoys are lost or damaged for whatever reason.  They have also been designed to be small and light enough to be deployed by kayak once the anchor has been installed provided the conditions are flat enough to safely do so.  We can also perform basic repairs by kayak such as swapping out the wave gauge or data transmitter because they are modular and connectorized in waterproof housings.  </p>

</div></div>","We are Check The Waves! 
We are lifelong surfers and are very passionate about the ocean and measuring waves.  As all surfers do we have relied on forecasts and a scattering of NOAA buoys, mostly far offshore, to assist us in deciding when or where to surf and as we all know forecasts and distant buoy observations quite often don't match what we see when we get to the beach.  As a result our mission is to enhance the decision making capabilities of surfers, fishermen, boaters, engineers and the like by providing real-time information about the nearshore ocean conditions.
We currently have 4 wave buoys deployed off the east coast of Florida and the current data from these stations can be freely viewed on our website at https://www.checkthewaves.com.  The information our buoys provide is being used by water sports enthusiasts, coastal engineers, wave forecast modellers and academia to name a few.  Our immediate goal is to install a fifth nearshore real-time wave buoy off West Palm Beach in Palm Beach County to report the actual nearshore wave conditions for the benefit of anyone who does anything on the water. 

We are a for-profit company with a social good mission, in other words we are mission driven not profit driven.  We are looking for like minded individuals and businesses to support this mission and become part of our team!
 


We are seeking a total of $14,000 to manufacture and deploy buoy number 5.  We anticipate the costs to be as follows:

Mr. Hunt
has worked as a consultant and designed analytics, defined KPIs, and developed
onboarding strategies for social media messaging apps that have been featured
by MacWorld, Geekwire, MIT, CNBC, and others. He found that giant coupon
websites were forcing businesses to reduce the cost of their products or
services by 20% - 30% and pocketing 50% of the remaining transaction, leaving
the businesses with 20% of the remaining revenue. Mr. Hunt performed market
research and found that small to medium size businesses, both online and local,
were forced to either use coupon websites that pocket 50% of each customer
purchase, cost per-click methods, or costly coupon mailers. </p>

<br/>The primary challenge of our Indiegogo will be to create a clear understanding in a wide customer base that our services offer a substantially larger savings than mega coupon companies and any other advertising solution. The secondary challenge is to create the public realization that Wizhunt tools can be used in an unlimited variety of businesses ventures such as real estate, automotive, Indiegogo campaigns, online stores, and local business, etc. Indiegogo will be to create a clear understanding that our business tools are multifaceted and can save both time and money. The challenges of our Indiegogo will be getting the word out and convincing users to participate, share, and adopt Wizhunt's opportunity. Thank You<br/>

Social
Media Autoposting in 17 SecondsVerify Deals in Seconds Why IndiegogoWell simply Indiegogo is best method for us to get the word out to the public and for us to raise funds. The Indiegogo community is supportive and engaged. Our small team created this innovative concept which eliminates
the middleman and takes deals directly from business to the consumer. Over the past few
years, we have perfected our model and added more powerful tools. As a
supporter, you will receive our service at a fraction of the retail price while
helping us improve our platform and enhance our development process. Goals 
Your financial support of our project will address four of our
goals in a timelier manner than we are currently able. We need to employ a Graphic UI/UX designer. We need to recruit another MVC.NET developer to help refine and update our product. We need a place of business to conduct our daily operations. Your support will enable
us to complete development of our mobile apps on iOS and Android, and ramp up our ability to polish our product and take it to market with momentum.  Better UI/UX and Graphics Another Part-Time MVC.NET Developer Office to Conduct Our Business                                    Scott Hunt is the owner, founder, and CEO of Wizhunt. Mr. Hunt
has worked as a consultant and designed analytics, defined KPIs, and developed
onboarding strategies for social media messaging apps that have been featured
by MacWorld, Geekwire, MIT, CNBC, and others. He found that giant coupon
websites were forcing businesses to reduce the cost of their products or
services by 20% - 30% and pocketing 50% of the remaining transaction, leaving
the businesses with 20% of the remaining revenue. Mr. Hunt performed market
research and found that small to medium size businesses, both online and local,
were forced to either use coupon websites that pocket 50% of each customer
purchase, cost per-click methods, or costly coupon mailers. 
Fulfillment
Plan
Upon completion of our Indiegogo campaign promotion codes will
be disbursed and operational on or before September 30th. On a link at the
bottom of Wizhunt Locals homepage contributors will be able to find their
names. The link will go to: https://www.wizhuntlocals.com/Indiegogo/aug/2016
Your FREE business website will be available
immediately after sign up.Challenges 
The primary challenge of our Indiegogo will be to create a clear understanding in a wide customer base that our services offer a substantially larger savings than mega coupon companies and any other advertising solution. The secondary challenge is to create the public realization that Wizhunt tools can be used in an unlimited variety of businesses ventures such as real estate, automotive, Indiegogo campaigns, online stores, and local business, etc. Indiegogo will be to create a clear understanding that our business tools are multifaceted and can save both time and money. The challenges of our Indiegogo will be getting the word out and convincing users to participate, share, and adopt Wizhunt's opportunity. Thank You

<li>
<strong>Hello!</strong> We are Himalayan Mushroom Firm. My name is Tika Ram Aryal, I am a botany professor at Tribuvhan University here in Pokhara, Nepal. From my passion and curiosity for mycology I started a small culture lab out of my home 13 years ago to practice mycelium culture propagation and seed spawn creation. My small project has turned quite the operation!</li>
<li>
<strong>Himalayan Mushroom Firm</strong> mushroom spawn and culture lab is the main provider of mushroom seed spawn in Western Nepal. We are unique because we are the only seed spawn lab in Nepal that creates mushroom seeds from pure cultures. This method helps the mushrooms become more resistant to disease and resilient to local environmental conditions. Himalayan Mushroom Firm provides seeds to farmers across 30 western districts of Nepal and we currently operate out of my home! Because space is limited it is difficult to achieve and maintain laboratory standards of cleanliness. The demand for seed is growing quickly and we have outgrown our current operation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Once funded</strong> the lab will be able to produce more spawn, provide support and education opportunities to mushroom farmers, produce higher quality spawn, and preserve new varieties of cultivable mushrooms. Our lab will help support more mushroom farmers across Nepal and preserve a diverse array of mushroom varieties.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><ul>
<li>We need $25,000 to achieve our goal.</li>
<li>The full cost of lab renovations and new equipment is $40,000. We have received $15,000 from the Agricultural Ministry Department of Nepal for the equipment and now we need the remaining $25,000 for building renovations, first two years rent, and shelving.</li>
<li> This money will be used to cover the first two years of rent on our new space and to outfit and renovate the lab to the highest sanitary conditions. This includes: new tile flooring, fresh paint, stainless steel tables and racks, plumbing, lighting, and an air conditioning unit.</li>

</ul><p><strong>The Why</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>We believe this is important because </strong>though only the size of Tennessee, Nepal is home to 30 million people. 70% of these people, make their income from agricultural work as subsistence farmers, meaning they must farm to make ends meet and also to feed their families. Because much of Nepal’s arable land lies on steep slopes and marginalized areas Nepali’s struggle to produce enough food. Rates of malnutrition, stunting, and anemia are staggeringly high within Nepal’s population, especially with women, young mothers, and children under five.</li>
<li>
<strong>According to the WHO </strong>over 40% of children under the age of five suffer from stunting, 11% of children suffer from wasting and 29% are underweight.      </li>
<li>Because of these issues the farmers of Nepal have turned to high value and specialty crops such as mushrooms to meet both the need for income generation and personal nutrition. Mushroom farming is desirable because it has low production cost, high market value and easy to grow from agricultural waste products. Mushrooms are also a good source of protein and vitamins.</li>
<li>Only two types of mushrooms exist in Nepal for cultivation: Oyster and Shiitake. While these are nutritious and easy to grow diversity in a system begets resilience. To help ensure that mushroom farmers can mitigate risks of crop failure from climate change and other environmental factors.</li>

<li>Himalayan Mushroom Firm is an existing and successful business. We have been creating and selling mushroom spawn for 13 years.</li>
<li>We have a long-standing relationship with the Nepal’s Ministry of Agriculture Department and have a wide spread reputation among mushroom farmers for having the best and most reliable source of seed spawn.</li>

<h3>Here We Go</h3>
<p>My name is Benjamin Woodard and I am the owner of Woodard Rod Company. I started fly fishing at the age of 12 in Texas with my dad. We snuck around the Middle Bosque River nailing bass and brim. Fast forward several years and I am sitting at a coffee shop in Arkadelphia, Arkansas where I have lived for the past 3 years. I have been wrapping rods since my teens, and been a trout guide since I moved up here. </p>
<p>I am sitting in this coffee shop writing out this dang thing for the 3rd time now. This campaign is my dream, and it is a dream that can succeed, and is on the verge of just that. I am that guy that does not stop moving and thinking about how I could make things better or how I can make a good impact. This rod company, I'm pretty sure, will make quite the positive impact. Bringing a chrisitan based rod company home, to make <strong>beautiful, quality, affordable, unique rods</strong> in a community that is as obsessed about trout as me. <strong>That</strong> is the dream. And I wouldn't be here writing this if it was not for my Family, my brothers Kyle, Chase, Beau, B-Ball, Stephen, and Jake.</p>
<p>By helping me achieve this dream, You will be supporting a company that will be producing quality USA made fly fishing rods, that will cost no more than $400 dollars. That is something no other company is doing. Major companies are asking $800-1200 dollars for a rod made in the USA. I pledge to also make a higher quality product. Basically, you are supporting a  better product, USA Made, and half the cost.</p>
<p>How can I do this? you'll just have to wait and see. Or order one of my rods already out in hands, and see for yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So. $18,256. That is the exact number we need to get everything off the ground. I am talking 300 blanks (100 of each rod series), corks, reel seats, eyelets, guides, tip tops, tootsie rolls, handtools, drying racks, graphics, some marketing through facebook and AdWords, some fan gear for our backers,  and 12 wrapping machines. We are choosing the best of the best, and not sacrificing quality for the sake of cutting costs. I decided to just make them in my apartment, to cut out the cost of opening a store front or shop. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What Do You Get?</p>
<p>A Dang sweet USA Made Fly Rod, a shirt or hat, some crazy cool stickers, and maybe a trip for two the Little Red river on a guided expedition for those sweet pigs, guided by me, Benjamin Woodard.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>First of all, the challenge with projects is always money or time, and in this case it is both. Making a fly rod takes a lot of time, and I've already succumbed to the idea of 24 hour work days. But money is the real issue here, and to bring production of a rod to the USA is a costly manor, and every little penny helps.</p>
<p>Quality in the rod business is a major risk. Blanks are usually rolled graphite, and imperfections in blanks are more common than should be. Fortunately, I have been wrapping rods since I was 17, and I am more than qualified to produce a quality fly rod.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help us.</p>
<p>We need to get the word out, in every way possible. For every share, you are entered to win a  free rod. Sharing on all platforms is encouraged, but we are on Facebook and Instagram. Winner will be announced at the end of the project. </p>

<p><strong>The story for WTSQ starts in 2015...</strong><br/><br/>Charleston’s independent community radio station started operating with a mission to bring a breath of fresh air to the radio waves. In the years since, WTSQ has become well known for its anniversary parties and member mixers, hosting local and national musical acts in non-traditional settings. WTSQ has also hosted live broadcasts of Charleston’s summer live music series, <i>Live on the Levee </i>every year. Over the last half a decade, the station has grown into a central part of the creative community in Charleston, curating a unique mix of music and personalities that give a local voice in a medium that has come to be dominated by national interests or out of state corporate media empires. WTSQ lives and breathes Charleston, and that’s how we like it!<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Pandemic Rock</strong><br/><br/>Like most everyone else, we’ve been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only did we have to quarantine our studios, but we also saw a lot of our opportunities for funding dry up. <u>Since March, we’ve been relying almost entirely on our sustaining members</u>.<br/><br/>Through it all, keeping your favorite hosts on the air was our priority. By modifying existing technology at the station, <i>Founder &amp; President Chris Long</i> developed a process that enabled DJs to broadcast from home. Thanks to this, since the start of the lockdown, WTSQ has been one of the only Charleston radio stations that has continuously broadcast live content. We do this because we know it matters to our listeners. Especially in these difficult last few months, we understand how important it is to have something consistent. If we can help it, we’re not going anywhere.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Become a part of WTSQ.</strong><br/><br/><u>July 10th - 17th is our 2020 Annual Fund Drive - during this time we want to raise $12,000</u>. That money goes directly to our operating costs - everything from rent, utilities, music licensing, and web hosting, to microphones, computers, and cables. Moreover, during the pandemic response, we have relied on a number of technologies in order to keep broadcasting live content and a homemade listening experience to you. All of this together isn’t a huge amount of money, especially when compared to the quality and quantity of what we create with it. Yet, simply put, <u>we cannot do it without the support we're asking for</u>.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>What do you get when you give?</strong><br/><br/>Donating to WTSQ supports the arts and enriches your community. Community radio provides a creative outlet and platform for area artists, as well as regional and touring acts. We are the only local radio station that plays WV artists every single day. Supporting WTSQ makes the town you live in a better place to live because it has a great radio station. WTSQ keeps you informed of events happening in your hometown.<br/><br/>Supporting WTSQ keeps <i>Josh Gaffin’s Afternoon Show</i> on the air. Josh has been coming to you weekdays since the station started - even during a pandemic. Gaffin provides basic news headlines and a specially curated mix that combines new wave and indie with just a hint of classic rock, soul and reggae. Amazing DJs like <i>Mya Ross</i> keep you up-to-date with the best new music from the best artists in the world. There are nearly 40 other shows that are broadcast weekly on WTSQ. All of this is offered free of charge to you, on 88.1 FM, streaming, or on our app. Listen all day if you want :)<br/><br/>There’s always something new or an old favorite coming up next. WTSQ is also your home for independent, progressive perspectives on the news of the day. We bring you Democracy Now! every weekday morning in the 8 o’clock and 9 o’clock hours because we know you want and need a fresh take on the news in the frankly insane world we live in these days. Our own <i>Mountain State Update with Dan Heyman</i> is also meant to offer a progressive take on local news. None of this is available from any other local source.<br/><br/><strong>WTSQ exists because we believe that local community radio makes Charleston and the Kanawha Valley a better place to be.

</div></div>","The story for WTSQ starts in 2015...Charleston’s independent community radio station started operating with a mission to bring a breath of fresh air to the radio waves. In the years since, WTSQ has become well known for its anniversary parties and member mixers, hosting local and national musical acts in non-traditional settings. WTSQ has also hosted live broadcasts of Charleston’s summer live music series, Live on the Levee every year. Over the last half a decade, the station has grown into a central part of the creative community in Charleston, curating a unique mix of music and personalities that give a local voice in a medium that has come to be dominated by national interests or out of state corporate media empires. WTSQ lives and breathes Charleston, and that’s how we like it! 
Pandemic RockLike most everyone else, we’ve been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only did we have to quarantine our studios, but we also saw a lot of our opportunities for funding dry up. Since March, we’ve been relying almost entirely on our sustaining members.Through it all, keeping your favorite hosts on the air was our priority. By modifying existing technology at the station, Founder & President Chris Long developed a process that enabled DJs to broadcast from home. Thanks to this, since the start of the lockdown, WTSQ has been one of the only Charleston radio stations that has continuously broadcast live content. We do this because we know it matters to our listeners. Especially in these difficult last few months, we understand how important it is to have something consistent. If we can help it, we’re not going anywhere. 
Become a part of WTSQ.July 10th - 17th is our 2020 Annual Fund Drive - during this time we want to raise $12,000. That money goes directly to our operating costs - everything from rent, utilities, music licensing, and web hosting, to microphones, computers, and cables. Moreover, during the pandemic response, we have relied on a number of technologies in order to keep broadcasting live content and a homemade listening experience to you. All of this together isn’t a huge amount of money, especially when compared to the quality and quantity of what we create with it. Yet, simply put, we cannot do it without the support we're asking for. 
What do you get when you give?Donating to WTSQ supports the arts and enriches your community. Community radio provides a creative outlet and platform for area artists, as well as regional and touring acts. We are the only local radio station that plays WV artists every single day. Supporting WTSQ makes the town you live in a better place to live because it has a great radio station. WTSQ keeps you informed of events happening in your hometown.Supporting WTSQ keeps Josh Gaffin’s Afternoon Show on the air. Josh has been coming to you weekdays since the station started - even during a pandemic. Gaffin provides basic news headlines and a specially curated mix that combines new wave and indie with just a hint of classic rock, soul and reggae. Amazing DJs like Mya Ross keep you up-to-date with the best new music from the best artists in the world. There are nearly 40 other shows that are broadcast weekly on WTSQ. All of this is offered free of charge to you, on 88.1 FM, streaming, or on our app. Listen all day if you want :)There’s always something new or an old favorite coming up next. WTSQ is also your home for independent, progressive perspectives on the news of the day. We bring you Democracy Now! every weekday morning in the 8 o’clock and 9 o’clock hours because we know you want and need a fresh take on the news in the frankly insane world we live in these days. Our own Mountain State Update with Dan Heyman is also meant to offer a progressive take on local news. None of this is available from any other local source.WTSQ exists because we believe that local community radio makes Charleston and the Kanawha Valley a better place to be. Your support makes it possible, now more than ever!

Πλέον, πρόκειται για ένα όραμα για την παραγωγή φρέσκων προϊόντων, τη διατήρηση της γης και την έμπνευση για μια νέα γενιά αγροτών, σε μια χώρα που αγωνίζεται να ξεφύγει από την οικονομική κρίση. Με τη βοήθεια και την υποστήριξή σας μπορούμε να τα καταφέρουμε!</strong></p><p><strong>Για την ελληνική έκδοση της υπόλοιπης ιστορίας μας, παρακαλούμε μεταβείτε στο κάτω μέρος της σελίδας.</strong></p><h3><strong>FarmFresh Hellas history</strong></h3><p>Here at FarmFresh Hellas we operate a small scale hydroponic greenhouse operation that was originally founded in 2009 by an ambitious and experienced Greek agronomist and farmer and his best friend. The company operated under a Greek name and was meant to deliver high quality vegetables for the local markets in Greece. Located in the heart of Greece, close to the stunning rock formations and monasteries of Meteora, with a mild, Mediterranean climate, clean and ample water and power supplies, as well as a perfect road infrastructure to the main cities Athens and Thessaloniki, the project was on a good road to success. The two partners took entrepreneurial risk at a time when Europe was struck by a deep economic crisis and Greek in particular went into an economic tailspin, that brought the country close to bankruptcy.</p><p>The farming project of the two partners started off well and after building the greenhouses and the state-of-the-art climate control systems, the production commenced and first harvests were sold. However, the deepening economic crisis in Greece, tax increases for the agricultural sector and skyrocketing unemployment let prices for vegetables and fruits fall significantly. Increasingly cheap and low-quality imports from Turkey and Northers Africa hit all farmers in Greece but the game-changing event for our farmers came in the form of a severe late spring thunderstorm that did not only destroy the greenhouses but wiped out the whole production of the year. Since this moment, the farm operated in a state of emergency, barely surviving with very low scale production.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509880654/w9dpgzepr6f6sjy4zjyi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The situation changed in 2015, when the farmers met a foreign idealist, who was fascinated by the idea of high-quality hydroponic vegetable production. They drafted a plan to revive the farm and ramp up production. Producing and selling high-quality, healthy, nutritious and savory vegetables and lettuce was just one part of the plan. Greece is still in crisis mode with capital controls in place since more than 2 years and unemployment still above 20%. So, the plan was also to create employment opportunities for local people and help the local community to pull themselves out of the dire economic situation.</p><p>FarmFresh Hellas was established in January 2016 and it took over the farming operations. Investors’ money helped to finance the first and most important repairs of the greenhouses and farming premises. Step after step, the farm improved and production started again.</p><h3>
<br/>FarmFresh Hellas today</h3><p>FarmFresh is in its second year of production now. All greenhouses enjoyed the most urgent repair works and currently we are in the middle of the peak harvest season. FarmFresh focuses on the production of tomatoes, green and colored peppers, chili peppers, lettuce and herbs. We are using hydroponic cultivation methods. These methods allow us to save up to 80% of water compared to traditional farming, making farming more sustainable. Hydroponics also allows to exactly tailor the combination and amount of fertilizer used for the plants, thus avoiding over-fertilization of soil. Hydroponics operate in a closed-circuit system, i.e. fertilizers are not dumped on the soil but re-used in a circulatory system. This way, we make farming more sustainable. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509829863/ljerz8m0snpj4pxs6nya.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The flip-side of Hydroponics is, that we will never get an “organic”-certificate because in almost all countries worldwide, organic certificates are only granted to traditional farmers. FarmFresh produces premium quality, healthy and nutritious vegetables without use of pesticides or herbicides. In our modern greenhouses our plants don’t easily develop and spread diseases, which makes the use of herbicides unnecessary. Greenhouse farming allows full climate-control throughout the year, i.e. we can create the climate that our plants need to enable best growth and perfect harvest results.</p><h3>How do we use the funds?</h3><p>FarmFresh started its production in 2016 and will have a first full year of production in 2017. We have invested lots of money, hard work and sweat to bring the greenhouses back to production. The most urgent repairs have been done, but more improvements need to be done.</p><p>The greenhouses plastic film for the other two greenhouses needs to be replaced. This is important for protecting our plants and production and to preserve energy during winter time. These old films might not hold another storm or severe wind which will bring us back to where we started. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509806559/x3nsyvhyjadnwaxvmmzf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The old pumps, a critical part of our production systems, need to be replaced. Our plants need their water and nutrients continuously and these pumps have done this for a long time. We repaired them, but now they have to be replaced by new plastic ones that will not errode.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509805861/g4fzegnagpghqlk0je9j.jpg"" src=""""/> </p><p>Our old forklift, that used to load pallets full of produce on the trucks delivering them to the market, is now almost dead. We have a plan to restore it, and we need it before new harvesting season starts. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509807596/ogbol8qttu1ldmbt0fde.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Furthermore, we have an outside nethouse area, that needs to be repaired. We also need to do investments in the packaging and the logistics process, with necessary repairs of the warehouse, the old truck and the cooling storage still waiting.</p><h3>Why this project is important</h3><p>As we mentioned above, Greece is still in economic crisis and FarmFresh wants to be an example of how investments in this beautiful country can create change. Domestic investments by local companies are crucial to create employment opportunities especially for the young people (youth unemployment rate in Greece is around 40%) and local production of healthy and high-quality food should help to balance the cheap and low-quality imports from other countries and offer a healthy food alternative to the Greek people. Finally, sustainable (hydroponic) farming concepts should contribute to the environment, water conservation and the reduction of fertilizer use. </p><h3>Our project is not risk-free</h3><p>Like other entrepreneurial activities, this project is not risk-free. Our major risk factors are:</p><ul>
<li>Very adverse weather conditions, leading to significantly reduced harvest yields.</li>
<li>Pests or diseases in the greenhouses.</li>
<li>Lack of skilled workers.</li>
<li>Low sales prices for a longer period of time (e.g. due to low-quality imports).</li>
<li>Change in consumer preferences.</li>

Η εταιρεία λειτουργούσε κάτω από ελληνική επωνυμία και είχε ως στόχο την παραγωγή υψηλής ποιότητας λαχανικών για την ελληνική αγορά. Τοποθετημένο στην καρδιά της Ελλάδας, κοντά στους επιβλητικούς σχηματισμούς και τα μοναστήρια των Μετεώρων, με ένα ήπιο, μεσογειακό κλίμα, καθαρά και μεγάλα αποθέματα νερού και ενέργειας, καθώς και άριστες οδικές υποδομές προς τις μεγαλύτερες ελληνικές πόλεις, της Αθήνας και της Θεσσαλονίκης, το έργο ήταν στον σωστό δρόμο προς την επιτυχία. Οι δύο συνέταιροι ανέλαβαν τον επιχειρηματικό κίνδυνο σε μια εποχή που η Ευρώπη χτυπήθηκε από μια βαθιά οικονομική κρίση, και ιδίως η Ελλάδα που βρέθηκε σε μια οικονομική δίνη, φέρνοντας την χώρα στα πρόθυρα της πτώχευσης.</p><p>Το επιχειρηματικό εγχείρημα των δύο συνεταίρων ξεκίνησε ομαλά και μετά την ολοκλήρωση της κατασκευής των θερμοκηπίων και την εγκατάσταση συστημάτων ελέγχου κλίματος και παραγωγής τελευταίας τεχνολογίας, η παραγωγή ξεκίνησε. Ωστόσο, η επιδείνωση της οικονομικής κρίσης στην Ελλάδα σε συνδυασμό με την αύξηση της φορολογίας στον αγροτικό τομέα και την εκτίναξη της ανεργίας, προκάλεσε την πτώση των τιμών στα φρούτα και τα λαχανικά. Τα όλο και περισσότερα φθηνά και χαμηλής ποιότητας εισαγόμενα προϊόντα από την Τουρκία και την Βόρειο Αφρική έπληξαν το σύνολο των παραγωγών στην Ελλάδα. Αλλά το κυριότερο πλήγμα για την επιχείρηση εκδηλώθηκε με τη μορφή μιας σφοδρής καταιγίδας που όχι μόνο κατέστρεψε τα θερμοκήπια, αλλά αφάνισε το σύνολο της τρέχουσας παραγωγής. Από εκείνη τη στιγμή, η μονάδα λειτουργεί σε κατάσταση έκτακτης ανάγκης, και επιβιώνει μόλις και μετά βίας, με μια πολύ μικρής κλίμακας παραγωγή.</p><p>Η κατάσταση άλλαξε το 2015, όταν οι δύο παραγωγοί συνάντησαν έναν ξένο ιδεαλιστή, ο οποίος γοητευμένος από την ιδέα της παραγωγής λαχανικών υψηλής ποιότητας μέσω της τεχνικής της υδροπονικής καλλιέργειας αποφασίζει να συνεργαστεί μαζί τους προκειμένου να αναβιώσει το αγρόκτημα και να επανέλθει η παραγωγή. Οι τρεις πλέον συνεργάτες, αποφασίζουν να συντάξουν ένα σχέδιο βασισμένο, τόσο στην παραγωγή και προώθηση υψηλής ποιότητας θρεπτικών λαχανικών όσο και στην δημιουργία ευκαιριών απασχόλησης για την τοπική κοινότητα, την στιγμή που η Ελλάδα εξακολουθεί να βρίσκεται σε κατάσταση κρίσης με τους ελέγχους κεφαλαίων να ισχύουν περισσότερο από 2 χρόνια και την ανεργία να υπερβαίνει το 20%.  </p><p>Η FarmFresh Hellas ιδρύθηκε τον Ιανουάριο του 2016 αναλαμβάνοντας την γεωργική εκμετάλλευση. Η χρηματοδότηση των επενδυτών βοήθησε να πραγματοποιηθούν οι αρχικές και πιο σημαντικές επισκευές και συντηρήσεις στα θερμοκήπια και στις λοιπές εγκαταστάσεις. Βήμα βήμα, το αγρόκτημα βελτιώθηκε και η παραγωγή ξεκίνησε και πάλι.</p><h3>Η FarmFresh Ελλάς σήμερα</h3><p>Σήμερα η FarmFresh βρίσκεται στο δεύτερο έτος παραγωγής της. Όλα τα θερμοκήπια δέχονται τις πιο επείγουσες εργασίες επισκευής και αυτή τη στιγμή διανύει στο τέλος της καλλιεργητικής περιόδου. Η FarmFresh επικεντρώνεται στην παραγωγή τομάτας, πράσινων και έγχρωμων πιπεριών, πιπεριών τσίλι, μαρουλιού και αρωματικών φυτών, χρησιμοποιώντας υδροπονική μέθοδο καλλιέργειας. Η μέθοδος αυτή μας επιτρέπει να εξοικονομούμε έως και 80% του νερού σε σύγκριση με την παραδοσιακή γεωργία, καθιστώντας την παραγωγή βιώσιμη. Η υδροπονία μας επιτρέπει επιπλέον να προσαρμόσουμε ακριβώς το συνδυασμό και την απαιτούμενη ποσότητα σε θρεπτικά στοιχεία για τα φυτά, αποφεύγοντας έτσι την άσκοπη λίπανση του εδάφους.

Οι εγχώριες επενδύσεις από τις τοπικές επιχειρήσεις είναι ζωτικής σημασίας για τη δημιουργία ευκαιριών απασχόλησης, ιδίως για τους νέους (ποσοστό ανεργίας των νέων στην Ελλάδα είναι περίπου 40%). Επιπλέον, η τοπική παραγωγή υγιεινών και υψηλής ποιότητας τροφίμων θα πρέπει να συμβάλει στην εξισορρόπηση των φθηνών και συνάμα χαμηλής ποιότητας εισαγόμενων από άλλες χώρες και να προσφέρουν μια υγιή εναλλακτική λύση διατροφής. Τέλος, η ιδέα της βιώσιμης (υδροπονικής) γεωργίας πρέπει να συμβάλει στη διασφάλιση του  περιβάλλοντος, την εξοικονόμηση νερού και τη μείωση της χρήσης λιπασμάτων.</p><h3>Το εγχείρημά μας ενέχει ρίσκο</h3><p>Όπως και άλλες επιχειρηματικές δραστηριότητες, το εγχείρημα αυτό δεν είναι χωρίς κινδύνους.

Πλέον, πρόκειται για ένα όραμα για την παραγωγή φρέσκων προϊόντων, τη διατήρηση της γης και την έμπνευση για μια νέα γενιά αγροτών, σε μια χώρα που αγωνίζεται να ξεφύγει από την οικονομική κρίση. Με τη βοήθεια και την υποστήριξή σας μπορούμε να τα καταφέρουμε!Για την ελληνική έκδοση της υπόλοιπης ιστορίας μας, παρακαλούμε μεταβείτε στο κάτω μέρος της σελίδας.FarmFresh Hellas historyHere at FarmFresh Hellas we operate a small scale hydroponic greenhouse operation that was originally founded in 2009 by an ambitious and experienced Greek agronomist and farmer and his best friend. The company operated under a Greek name and was meant to deliver high quality vegetables for the local markets in Greece. Located in the heart of Greece, close to the stunning rock formations and monasteries of Meteora, with a mild, Mediterranean climate, clean and ample water and power supplies, as well as a perfect road infrastructure to the main cities Athens and Thessaloniki, the project was on a good road to success. The two partners took entrepreneurial risk at a time when Europe was struck by a deep economic crisis and Greek in particular went into an economic tailspin, that brought the country close to bankruptcy.The farming project of the two partners started off well and after building the greenhouses and the state-of-the-art climate control systems, the production commenced and first harvests were sold. However, the deepening economic crisis in Greece, tax increases for the agricultural sector and skyrocketing unemployment let prices for vegetables and fruits fall significantly. Increasingly cheap and low-quality imports from Turkey and Northers Africa hit all farmers in Greece but the game-changing event for our farmers came in the form of a severe late spring thunderstorm that did not only destroy the greenhouses but wiped out the whole production of the year. Since this moment, the farm operated in a state of emergency, barely surviving with very low scale production.The situation changed in 2015, when the farmers met a foreign idealist, who was fascinated by the idea of high-quality hydroponic vegetable production. They drafted a plan to revive the farm and ramp up production. Producing and selling high-quality, healthy, nutritious and savory vegetables and lettuce was just one part of the plan. Greece is still in crisis mode with capital controls in place since more than 2 years and unemployment still above 20%. So, the plan was also to create employment opportunities for local people and help the local community to pull themselves out of the dire economic situation.FarmFresh Hellas was established in January 2016 and it took over the farming operations. Investors’ money helped to finance the first and most important repairs of the greenhouses and farming premises. Step after step, the farm improved and production started again.
FarmFresh Hellas todayFarmFresh is in its second year of production now. All greenhouses enjoyed the most urgent repair works and currently we are in the middle of the peak harvest season. FarmFresh focuses on the production of tomatoes, green and colored peppers, chili peppers, lettuce and herbs. We are using hydroponic cultivation methods. These methods allow us to save up to 80% of water compared to traditional farming, making farming more sustainable. Hydroponics also allows to exactly tailor the combination and amount of fertilizer used for the plants, thus avoiding over-fertilization of soil. Hydroponics operate in a closed-circuit system, i.e. fertilizers are not dumped on the soil but re-used in a circulatory system. This way, we make farming more sustainable. The flip-side of Hydroponics is, that we will never get an “organic”-certificate because in almost all countries worldwide, organic certificates are only granted to traditional farmers. FarmFresh produces premium quality, healthy and nutritious vegetables without use of pesticides or herbicides. In our modern greenhouses our plants don’t easily develop and spread diseases, which makes the use of herbicides unnecessary. Greenhouse farming allows full climate-control throughout the year, i.e. we can create the climate that our plants need to enable best growth and perfect harvest results.How do we use the funds?FarmFresh started its production in 2016 and will have a first full year of production in 2017. We have invested lots of money, hard work and sweat to bring the greenhouses back to production. The most urgent repairs have been done, but more improvements need to be done.The greenhouses plastic film for the other two greenhouses needs to be replaced. This is important for protecting our plants and production and to preserve energy during winter time. These old films might not hold another storm or severe wind which will bring us back to where we started. The old pumps, a critical part of our production systems, need to be replaced. Our plants need their water and nutrients continuously and these pumps have done this for a long time. We repaired them, but now they have to be replaced by new plastic ones that will not errode. Our old forklift, that used to load pallets full of produce on the trucks delivering them to the market, is now almost dead. We have a plan to restore it, and we need it before new harvesting season starts. Furthermore, we have an outside nethouse area, that needs to be repaired. We also need to do investments in the packaging and the logistics process, with necessary repairs of the warehouse, the old truck and the cooling storage still waiting.Why this project is importantAs we mentioned above, Greece is still in economic crisis and FarmFresh wants to be an example of how investments in this beautiful country can create change. Domestic investments by local companies are crucial to create employment opportunities especially for the young people (youth unemployment rate in Greece is around 40%) and local production of healthy and high-quality food should help to balance the cheap and low-quality imports from other countries and offer a healthy food alternative to the Greek people. Finally, sustainable (hydroponic) farming concepts should contribute to the environment, water conservation and the reduction of fertilizer use. Our project is not risk-freeLike other entrepreneurial activities, this project is not risk-free. Our major risk factors are:
Very adverse weather conditions, leading to significantly reduced harvest yields.
Pests or diseases in the greenhouses.
Lack of skilled workers.
Low sales prices for a longer period of time (e.g. due to low-quality imports).
Change in consumer preferences.

Η ιστορία της FarmFresh Ελλάς Η FarmFresh Ελλάς διαχειρίζεται μία μικρής κλίμακας υδροπονική, θερμοκηπιακή εγκατάσταση, που ιδρύθηκε αρχικά το 2009 από έναν φιλόδοξο και έμπειρο Έλληνα γεωπόνο και τον καλύτερό του φίλο και συνεργάτη. Η εταιρεία λειτουργούσε κάτω από ελληνική επωνυμία και είχε ως στόχο την παραγωγή υψηλής ποιότητας λαχανικών για την ελληνική αγορά. Τοποθετημένο στην καρδιά της Ελλάδας, κοντά στους επιβλητικούς σχηματισμούς και τα μοναστήρια των Μετεώρων, με ένα ήπιο, μεσογειακό κλίμα, καθαρά και μεγάλα αποθέματα νερού και ενέργειας, καθώς και άριστες οδικές υποδομές προς τις μεγαλύτερες ελληνικές πόλεις, της Αθήνας και της Θεσσαλονίκης, το έργο ήταν στον σωστό δρόμο προς την επιτυχία. Οι δύο συνέταιροι ανέλαβαν τον επιχειρηματικό κίνδυνο σε μια εποχή που η Ευρώπη χτυπήθηκε από μια βαθιά οικονομική κρίση, και ιδίως η Ελλάδα που βρέθηκε σε μια οικονομική δίνη, φέρνοντας την χώρα στα πρόθυρα της πτώχευσης.Το επιχειρηματικό εγχείρημα των δύο συνεταίρων ξεκίνησε ομαλά και μετά την ολοκλήρωση της κατασκευής των θερμοκηπίων και την εγκατάσταση συστημάτων ελέγχου κλίματος και παραγωγής τελευταίας τεχνολογίας, η παραγωγή ξεκίνησε. Ωστόσο, η επιδείνωση της οικονομικής κρίσης στην Ελλάδα σε συνδυασμό με την αύξηση της φορολογίας στον αγροτικό τομέα και την εκτίναξη της ανεργίας, προκάλεσε την πτώση των τιμών στα φρούτα και τα λαχανικά. Τα όλο και περισσότερα φθηνά και χαμηλής ποιότητας εισαγόμενα προϊόντα από την Τουρκία και την Βόρειο Αφρική έπληξαν το σύνολο των παραγωγών στην Ελλάδα. Αλλά το κυριότερο πλήγμα για την επιχείρηση εκδηλώθηκε με τη μορφή μιας σφοδρής καταιγίδας που όχι μόνο κατέστρεψε τα θερμοκήπια, αλλά αφάνισε το σύνολο της τρέχουσας παραγωγής. Από εκείνη τη στιγμή, η μονάδα λειτουργεί σε κατάσταση έκτακτης ανάγκης, και επιβιώνει μόλις και μετά βίας, με μια πολύ μικρής κλίμακας παραγωγή.Η κατάσταση άλλαξε το 2015, όταν οι δύο παραγωγοί συνάντησαν έναν ξένο ιδεαλιστή, ο οποίος γοητευμένος από την ιδέα της παραγωγής λαχανικών υψηλής ποιότητας μέσω της τεχνικής της υδροπονικής καλλιέργειας αποφασίζει να συνεργαστεί μαζί τους προκειμένου να αναβιώσει το αγρόκτημα και να επανέλθει η παραγωγή. Οι τρεις πλέον συνεργάτες, αποφασίζουν να συντάξουν ένα σχέδιο βασισμένο, τόσο στην παραγωγή και προώθηση υψηλής ποιότητας θρεπτικών λαχανικών όσο και στην δημιουργία ευκαιριών απασχόλησης για την τοπική κοινότητα, την στιγμή που η Ελλάδα εξακολουθεί να βρίσκεται σε κατάσταση κρίσης με τους ελέγχους κεφαλαίων να ισχύουν περισσότερο από 2 χρόνια και την ανεργία να υπερβαίνει το 20%.  Η FarmFresh Hellas ιδρύθηκε τον Ιανουάριο του 2016 αναλαμβάνοντας την γεωργική εκμετάλλευση. Η χρηματοδότηση των επενδυτών βοήθησε να πραγματοποιηθούν οι αρχικές και πιο σημαντικές επισκευές και συντηρήσεις στα θερμοκήπια και στις λοιπές εγκαταστάσεις. Βήμα βήμα, το αγρόκτημα βελτιώθηκε και η παραγωγή ξεκίνησε και πάλι.Η FarmFresh Ελλάς σήμεραΣήμερα η FarmFresh βρίσκεται στο δεύτερο έτος παραγωγής της. Όλα τα θερμοκήπια δέχονται τις πιο επείγουσες εργασίες επισκευής και αυτή τη στιγμή διανύει στο τέλος της καλλιεργητικής περιόδου.

<p>We are a group of final year Media students at the University of Brighton engaged in an action-based learning course in which students utilise their skills, knowledge and expertise to develop community technology partnerships and activities with a view to empower and meet the needs of disenfranchised communities in Kenya. For the past 3 years the University have been developing an active partnership with community development projects in Kenya, to provide training and advice to an increasing number of communities, NGOs, and networks.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is the problem? How are we going to fix it?</span></strong></p>
<p>There is a growing desire in Kenyan communities to enrich and shape their futures in a world increasing influenced through information communication technologies (ICT) through education and training. Unfortunately, many Kenyans find themselves disenfranchised from participating as citizens of the technological world through lack of access to the technological infrastructure and the literacy required to use ICTs. We seek to address this disenfranchisement by empowering &amp; supporting local communities, NGOs and youth networks through capacity building activities. Each year community media students plan, organise and implement a diverse range of ICT related ‘training the trainers’ workshops through regular dialogue with our Kenyan partners who conduct local needs analysis to inform this planning.  Our participatory learning workshops (PLWs) are especially designed to meet the needs articulated by our Kenyan partners. For example, last year’s workshops was influenced by the desire of Youth NGOs to bring young Kenyans together to discuss and promote peace in the run up to, and after, the upcoming General Election and avoid the tragic inter-tribal violence of 2007/08. The workshops, held in 3 different locations, taught over 70 young Kenyans from 6 different tribes the art of digital video production. The aim was to enable diverse voices of young Kenyans to be heard through their own stories told in their own way. The powerful stories told in the video resulting from these workshops has been used in Kenya to organise community peace forums and illustrate how people from different tribal cultures share common experiences and hopes for peace.</p>
<p>This year we have been asked to design training workshops to illustrate how a range of social media applications can be used to support young entrepreneurs grow their businesses; farmers in rural Kenya share agricultural information and musicians learn video and audio editing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How will the money help fix the problem? / How much do we need?</span></strong></p>
<p>The more money we can raise, the more students we can assist in community capacity building. For example, if student can teach 10 Kenyans and each of those trainees become trainers and teach another 10 then the knowledge and skills can be spread swiftly and in a manner that honours and respects local culture and customs. The community benefits of these workshops are enriched by the number of students able to share their skills and expertise as trainers. We receive no formal funding for these activities, which are totally dependent on the money we raise if they are to take place. We are currently engaged in awareness raising and promotional activities so that we raise the funds necessary to meet workshop and equipment costs, transport costs, pay subsistence costs to families we stay with.  Breaking these costs down, each fieldtrip needs to raise £1000 per student in order to organise our interventions effectively. Currently, we are hoping to take 6 students to Kenya, which means we need to raise £6,000. Students are actively engaged in fund raising activities ranging from research poster design competitions; proposal writing; scholarship applications; organising gigs and club nights; sponsored walks; cake sales and community fun days to name but a few.</p>

We call on your generosity to support us in this work. All contributions are greatly appreciated and go a long way to supporting the project. By supporting us you are actively making a difference to the quality of people’s lives in Kenya.

<p>We are attempting to create a local Buisness called: Game hub. </p>
<p>Game Hub will serve as so much more than just a videogame shop. It will serve as a constant social mixer, involving: music, movies, books, comics, cards, collectibles, and videogames. It will serve as a fun and safe establishment for people of all ages and tastes. It will be a fun place where you can be with your friends and family in a very awesome relaxing atmosphere of entertainment and enjoyment. We want Game Hub to be the community core for all things video games and collectibles in the Sonora area and beyond. We want to extinguish the stigma that video gamers aren't social and live in the basement. We are highly driven and passionate individuals that love these various artistic mediums for all that they have given to us over the years. We hope to educate and enrich people's knowledge of these things and sustain the local Indie community as much as possible. We want to have a community where fundraisers for causes are constant, fruitful, and elated through the charitable nature of people everywhere. We want to be something more than just a small business; we want to be a part of the future of gaming, collecting, and openhandedness.</p>
<h1>FUNDING</h1>
<p>What we're asking for is pretty simple-</p>
<p>We are now in a situation where Game Hub might be able to open within a reasonable amount of time if we have a successful fundraiser , because at the moment our funds would be too thin to operate effectively. Any funds we gain are very usable. So, depending on how much people donate, Game Hub will open..., but we just aren't sure how long we will be able to stay open without a solid cushion. It all really depends on the people. The more funding we receive the more prestigious the project will become and For the cost of one night out with your friends you could heavily influence the success of this project.</p>
<p>If you can't donate a lot, that's fine. Just donate what you can and remember: Every dollar that we get puts us closer to our goal. </p>
<h1>What's In It For Me?</h1>
<p>Good question. Well, take a look to the right and see the different rewards that are available for different pledge amounts. You'll notice that most of them include a newly-devolped Game Hub 'PrizeCards', which will ship once they've been reprinted. Depending on how much people contribute,  we will section off a large piece of the wall space in Game Hub and put the names (or Screen Names) of the contributor who bought that perk on the ‘CREDITS’ wall- which we think is pretty cool, in our highly biased opinion.</p>
<p>Below are some of the awesome Limited Edition perks you can buy. </p>
<p>REMEMBER: It cost's Game Hub money to profide these perks. If you like a perk and can afford the price, Buy It! But- If you can afford a perk, but don't care for the item, contribute that amount, but don't claim the perk. </p>

<h3>Help Us Light Up the Night</h3>

<p>What our new location doesn't have is a beautiful Toy Joy sign!  In fact, there is no sign there at all!  In order to complete our move to this amazing new location, we are asking for your help!  $10,000 will cover the costs and installation of a locally crafted, environmentally friendly Toy Joy sign.  </p>

We will offer individuals the opportunity to purchase pigs and turkeys as babies, the ability to come to the farm to visit and share in the growing cycle progress until they are ready to be processed.

<p>In all that we do, we purpose to exhibit the following values;</p>
<p>Natural – As much as possible we will work with nature and not against it. This includes free ranging animals, staying clear of antibiotics and hormones in our livestock, utilizing natural pest prevention systems, and natural fertilizers.</p>
<p>Health – We will work our hardest to produce the highest quality and the healthiest food we are capable to produce, and work to ensure that people of all income levels have access to high quality, healthy, local food.</p>
<p>Hands on learning – We believe that learning with the head, the heart, and the hands is the best way to learn. In that way, all of our education will engage all three elements and be person centered.</p>
<p>Community – We believe that food is at the heart of the community and commit to regularly working with the local community to plan and design our services. We will market exclusively to individuals and businesses within 80 miles of the farm in an effort to invest in the local economy and ensure that we support those on low or no income.</p>

<p>The Republican and Democratic conventions are fast approaching. The host cities, Tampa, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina, are rolling out the red carpet for thousands of delegates, reporters, and partisans who will amass for days downtown. It would be nice if the same were true for those who plan to attend without the benefit of a convention badge.</p>
<p>But if recent news is any guide, protesters will face big barriers to making their voices heard. Both cities have already passed ordinances that restrict movement near the convention, allow police to search people without cause, and ban a dizzying list of household items, all in the name of security. Charlotte police are busy spending $25 million on new equipment, while Tampa's police department has already test-driven a tank down the streets of the city's financial district.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>The National Lawyers Guild (NLG) has experience with this kind of thing. For three quarters of a century now, the NLG has been defending social justice movements, from labor to civil rights to Occupy. In recent years we’ve seen protesters subjected to preemptive raids, mass arrests, gassing, and plain brutality by law enforcement, all in an effort to scare dissent off of the streets.</p>
<p>We hope these scenes don’t replay in Tampa and Charlotte but if they do, we’ll be ready. The NLG will have legal teams on the ground during the conventions in both cities.

<p><strong>What We Do<br/></strong></p>
<p>Over decades of developing our Legal Observer® program we've found again and again that just the presence of Legal Observers® is enough to make police think twice about abusing the badge. And when the cuffs and clubs do come out, we don't just document brutality. That is an important part of it, but our legal help line enables Legal Observers® and protesters to call in up-to-the-minute information to an office of lawyers, law students, and legal workers. The office team, in turn, tracks people through the legal system, begins work on defense strategy, and makes sure there's a lawyer waiting in court when arrested protesters first appear.</p>
<p>The impact of this work goes beyond securing not guilty pleas: NLG protest lawsuits have prompted major changes to police practices in cities around the country.</p>
<p>NLG members will converge on Tampa and Charlotte with unmatched experience at and dedication to doing this work.</p>
<p>But we can’t do it without your help.</p>
<p>The NLG is a non-profit, membership organization, and our RNC/DNC legal team will be made up entirely of volunteers. Still, a legal support effort this large costs money.

<p>Think back. Has the NLG ever helped you or someone you know through a protest arrest? Have you ever been comforted by the sight of our green hats at a demonstration? Do you want to help fight for a world where human rights are valued over property interests? If so, please consider giving today.</p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly toward the nuts and bolts we need to defend protesters’ rights at the RNC and DNC.

<h3> </h3></div>","What's Happening
The Republican and Democratic conventions are fast approaching. The host cities, Tampa, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina, are rolling out the red carpet for thousands of delegates, reporters, and partisans who will amass for days downtown. It would be nice if the same were true for those who plan to attend without the benefit of a convention badge.
But if recent news is any guide, protesters will face big barriers to making their voices heard. Both cities have already passed ordinances that restrict movement near the convention, allow police to search people without cause, and ban a dizzying list of household items, all in the name of security. Charlotte police are busy spending $25 million on new equipment, while Tampa's police department has already test-driven a tank down the streets of the city's financial district.
Who We Are
The National Lawyers Guild (NLG) has experience with this kind of thing. For three quarters of a century now, the NLG has been defending social justice movements, from labor to civil rights to Occupy. In recent years we’ve seen protesters subjected to preemptive raids, mass arrests, gassing, and plain brutality by law enforcement, all in an effort to scare dissent off of the streets.
We hope these scenes don’t replay in Tampa and Charlotte but if they do, we’ll be ready. The NLG will have legal teams on the ground during the conventions in both cities. Our trained Legal Observers® will be in the streets for as long as protesters are, recording arrests and police misconduct, backed by a coordinating office and 24-hour hotlines.
What We Do
Over decades of developing our Legal Observer® program we've found again and again that just the presence of Legal Observers® is enough to make police think twice about abusing the badge. And when the cuffs and clubs do come out, we don't just document brutality. That is an important part of it, but our legal help line enables Legal Observers® and protesters to call in up-to-the-minute information to an office of lawyers, law students, and legal workers. The office team, in turn, tracks people through the legal system, begins work on defense strategy, and makes sure there's a lawyer waiting in court when arrested protesters first appear.
The impact of this work goes beyond securing not guilty pleas: NLG protest lawsuits have prompted major changes to police practices in cities around the country.
NLG members will converge on Tampa and Charlotte with unmatched experience at and dedication to doing this work.
But we can’t do it without your help.
The NLG is a non-profit, membership organization, and our RNC/DNC legal team will be made up entirely of volunteers. Still, a legal support effort this large costs money.

Why Indiegogo?
The NLG is a grassroots organization and we figured, what better way to fundraise than a grassroots campaign?
How You Can Help

<h3>An Invitation</h3>
<p>This is an invitation to join us in one of the most exciting journeys: To help us be able to host our four month <a href=""http://kufunda.wordpress.com/16-2/youth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kufunda Youth Programme</a>, or in other words: to help us to be able to forever change the lives of 24 young Zimbabweans and ourselves in the process :). <br/><br/>Because this - in a nutshell - is what we do. We help young people wake up to who they are, to a passion and a sense of possibility that many of them had barely suspected before. Make no mistake - it is their passion and their brilliance, but we are a place - a learning village - which gives them an experience of another way of being - as a human being and as a community. We live and learn beside them for four months - during that time intentionally working to draw out and ignite their spark, their beauty, and their gift to the world.<br/><br/><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kufunda.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kufunda</a> is a Learning Village in Zimbabwe, which for the past 10 years has worked with Zimbabwean communities around practical experiences of what it takes to create healthy vibrant communities. During the last two years, our emphasis and focus has moved to work with young people during longer immersive programmes at Kufunda where we experience together  how to live sustainably, how to create nourishing and resilient community and how to use projects as the vehicle to live our dreams.</p>
<p>And in the process our learning village has itself been ignited and brought to life, as the energy and learning of the young Zimbabweans infuses us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Receive</h3>
<p>The programme will cost us a total of 20,168 USD. We have raised a small part of that, and need to raise an additional 17,268 USD before the end of October.</p>
<p>Each participant has to find $50 as a personal contribution to the programme which in rural Zimbabwe is a large sum of money.  But the cost of putting one young person through the entire 4 month programme is 850 USD.  </p>
<p>Most of the funds cover the food and board of the youth, a stipend for four facilitators who devote their time to this programme during the four months it runs, and some funds for guest facilitators and materials.</p>
<p>We offer you the opportunity to be part of our community of learning. You will receive monthly news from the youth while they are here, taking a peek into the unfolding journey that they are on with us. </p>
<p>Most importantly perhaps is the knowledge that you are part of an initiative, which believes in the value and beauty of these young people - and their power to be part of shifting their communities to more connected vibrant places.</p>
<p>No contribution is too small.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p><span>From evaluation of our most recent programme, there are three keys areas that the participants particularly value:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>a significant shift in their sense of self,</span></li>
<li><span>a very different understanding of sustainability and working with nature, and </span></li>
<li><span>a deeper appreciation for community, and what becomes possible in a connected community. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>In their words:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“This programme helped me to get to know myself. ‘Who am I? What do I expect from my life, what is my focus and passion for my life?’ It brought in a new beginning.""</em></p>
<p><em>""The Sustainable Living practicals helped me to have some ideas about what I can do to live a life sustainably, and it created the love bond between me and the nature/environment. I can now consider it to be the greatest wealth I have.”</em></p>
<div>
<p><em>“When I saw the herbal garden it made me very happy and excited. In my community there is no such garden or herbs. I feel I need to bring these to my people.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>“</strong>Appreciative Inquiry in Community Development was helpful because it promotes diversity among people. In appreciating the talent or skill I am encouraging others in their talent to earn a better living. Some of our cultures are breaking down and I feel that in using Appreciative Inquiry I can rebuild a vibrant community."" </em></p>
<p>Several of past participants have begun their own projects, as well as hosting community gatherings, sharing what they have learnt and seeking to organise young people, and the community more generally, towards community sustainability initiatives. Our ability to bring more young people from these same communities will enable us and them to grow the group of people able to enable these developments.</p>

A finalized system is required to show content providers that the XCINEX Audience Detection Sensor is unmistakably accurate and that content uploaded to the platform is completely secure. To achieve this task within the timeline we have set and successfully launch the XCINEX Platform by December 25, 2015; we are looking to raise, in our first round of funding, $155,000 through crowd-funding. Our goal is to raise $3 Million Dollars within the next 12 months through various funding campaigns. Rather than running one single campaign for the entire amount of $3M, we've decided to take things step by step utilizing numerous funding platforms, with smaller funding goals, to reach our milestones. Funds will be used to perfect the XCINEX Audience Detection Sensor making audience detection fool-proof and finalizing the Global Cinema Platform by developing and fine-tuning its full spectrum of operational functions, features and communication with other devices.

Once the final product is complete, funds will be used to travel and meet with studios to present them the XCINEX Global Cinema Platform. By demonstrating its ingenious security features and fool-proof audience detection sensor capability, XCINEX will obtain content commitments. XCINEX will increase the revenue of studios tremendously giving them instant 24/7 access to hundreds of millions of consumers world wide.

This is our main reason for choosing the option for flexible funding. XCINEX is evolution and it is unstoppable! This is the natural progression of the market as internet becomes faster, more readily available and home entertainment technologies become more enhanced.

the first global cinema platform, XCINEX has a tremendously beneficial impact
on the film industry as well as consumers worldwide. XCINEX provides a level
playing field for all production companies, major and independent, to instantly reach mass
audiences world wide. Consumers all over the world can instantly access content and studios can get the most recognition and value for their
work. Until now, going to a movie theater and catching a showtime was your only
option to watch 1st run movies in optimal quality. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After about a week of the
theatrical release, you can get illegal torrents from online with terrible
audio/video quality. Couple weeks more, you can buy a pirated copy of the movie
with so-so audio/video quality with subtitles you don't need and probably can't
remove. By the way, this is an illegal act which we do not condone and are working to eliminate. A couple
more weeks and the movie is now available on Netflix, DVD or illegally online. Well, XCINEX provides instant satisfaction and removes the need for consumers to settle for pirated content or endure the long wait between theatrical release and DVD releases.   </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/>
With the XCINEX Platform, studios will upload their latest content onto a
secure platform for everyone to enjoy instantly. With an audience detection
sensor, studios have no risk of losing revenue because just like the theater,
each person watching the movie is required to have a ticket. In fact, studies show that XCINEX will increase 1st run, DVD and Soundtrack revenue for studios. Working with some
of the best in the industry, XCINEX also eradicates piracy utilizing numerous
technologies designed specifically to ensure digital content security. Finally, a
product designed specifically for the film industry with both the studios and
the consumers in mind. XCINEX also offers studios a fixed 90% of each ticket sale for as long as the content is on the platform. This is much better than the sliding scale used in the industry today.    <br/><br/>
XCINEX Members world wide will have the luxury of streaming first run movies,
direct from studios from all over the world, in full HD or 3D, right to the comfort
of their homes. Grab your favorite drink, order your pizza, slip into your favorite PJ's, sit or lay on your own couch and enjoy the latest 1st run movie. Need a break? Pause the movie or save it to watch it later. XCINEX works on many devices anywhere with
high-speed internet. Enjoy the latest motion picture entertainment on your TV,
tablet or phone. Access the XCINEX Platform from your home, RV, yacht or vacation cabin. XCINEX is perfect for commercial application as well bringing 1st run movies to hotel
rooms, hospitals, dorm rooms pretty much any location with internet. Remember, each person in the room must purchase a ticket so studios never risk losing revenue!  <br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can help in many ways!

remove. By the way, this is an illegal act which we do not condone and are working to eliminate. A couple
more weeks and the movie is now available on Netflix, DVD or illegally online. Well, XCINEX provides instant satisfaction and removes the need for consumers to settle for pirated content or endure the long wait between theatrical release and DVD releases.   

With the XCINEX Platform, studios will upload their latest content onto a
secure platform for everyone to enjoy instantly. With an audience detection
sensor, studios have no risk of losing revenue because just like the theater,
each person watching the movie is required to have a ticket. In fact, studies show that XCINEX will increase 1st run, DVD and Soundtrack revenue for studios. Working with some
of the best in the industry, XCINEX also eradicates piracy utilizing numerous
technologies designed specifically to ensure digital content security. Finally, a
product designed specifically for the film industry with both the studios and
the consumers in mind. XCINEX also offers studios a fixed 90% of each ticket sale for as long as the content is on the platform. This is much better than the sliding scale used in the industry today.    
XCINEX Members world wide will have the luxury of streaming first run movies,
direct from studios from all over the world, in full HD or 3D, right to the comfort
of their homes. Grab your favorite drink, order your pizza, slip into your favorite PJ's, sit or lay on your own couch and enjoy the latest 1st run movie. Need a break? Pause the movie or save it to watch it later. XCINEX works on many devices anywhere with
high-speed internet. Enjoy the latest motion picture entertainment on your TV,
tablet or phone. Access the XCINEX Platform from your home, RV, yacht or vacation cabin. XCINEX is perfect for commercial application as well bringing 1st run movies to hotel
rooms, hospitals, dorm rooms pretty much any location with internet. Remember, each person in the room must purchase a ticket so studios never risk losing revenue!  Other Ways You Can HelpYou can help in many ways!

<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
<p>We are Nebulous Technologies. Mike has been a designer and entrepreneur for 30 years. Jonathan makes games and apps for mobile devices. We've been working together on a project for the past 5 years in our spare time.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS OUR IDEA?</h2>
<p>Our starting point was the observation that all animatronic ('robot') toys on the market were without exception boring, predictable and inane. We set out to change that by asking the question: If mobile animatronic toys could talk to each other, what would they say, and what would they do?</p>
<p>Well, they could share data about their environment, they could learn from each other, they could develop adaptive behaviours, and collaborate to achieve objectives which are impossible individually.</p>
<h2>WHAT HAVE WE DONE?</h2>
<p>We have developed a small, cheap wireless device (patent pending) which, inserted into any animatronic toy design, enables such toys to form social groups spontaneously and provides dynamic spatial awareness. The device is user-programmable, <span>providing full control of all the toy's features</span> in the context of shared data, and therefore infinite variation of personality and capability.</p>
<p>The working title of this technology has been CUI, but we know that's lame. Get involved and help us come up with a better name!</p>
<h2>WHAT IS OUR PLAN?</h2>
<p>We intend to sell this device in large quantities to major toy manufacturers.</p>
<p>But applying this device to EXISTING animtronic toys barely scratches the surface of its potential applications. This technology gives rise to an entirely new genre of animatronic products where socialization, collaboration and dynamic spatial awareness are central to the design.</p>
<p>Any product built around this technology can be responsive, adaptive and unpredictable to its human user. And these capabilities multiply exponentially when many toys interact with each other, and with their human users.</p>
<p>The opportunities for end-user-programmability are substantial, and applications extend well beyond entertainment.</p>
<h2>WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?</h2>
<p>Imagine, for instance, an animatronic puppy dog which follows you around wherever you go (sometimes even when you tell him not to), who will mimic your movements, learn the tricks you try to teach him, and <span>play fetching a ball, or hide-and-seek, with you if you ask nicely</span>. A puppy dog who is just as happy to amuse himself, to gambol and <span>play hide-and-seek or ball games with other puppy dogs</span>, and who will also take himself off for a nap in his basket when he gets tired.</p>
<p>Imagine a squadron of six animatronic tanks attacking an enemy position over any terrain you care to construct. You decide your battle plan, but it may have to be torn up soon after engagement with the enemy begins. Your friend will have his own plan on how to deploy his squadron of tanks to defend the position, and he may have decided on a pre-emptive strike. Battle orders are delivered to the squadron by mobile app or PC, but then they’re on their own and anything could happen.</p>
<p>Imagine intelligent spatially-aware inter-communicating toy weapons in the hands of a human operator, fighting with other humans in a squad against either an animatronic enemy or a similarly empowered human enemy, and you have the makings of a new participation sport.</p>
<p>Imagine how powerfully the web can be used to share experiences, videos, ideas and end-user-developed software.</p>
<h2>WORLD DOMINATION?</h2>
<p>This is a mass market technology. By Christmas 2015 we want all of the most popular animatronic toys world-wide to be enpowered to reach their full potential.</p>
<h2>WHAT DO WE NEED THIS MONEY FOR?</h2>
<p>This project has been a labour of love for many years. We put food on our table by other means, and have devoted all our spare time and money to get the idea to this stage. </p>
<p>What we need now is to move to the production engineering stage so that we can manufacture the <span>device </span>in large quantities. We will establish a worldwide standard so that we can guarantee the inter-operation of all devices powered by it. Imagine your dinosaur playing with your tank, and puppy and helicopter...</p>
<p>To be absolutely clear, none of the money raised will go on anything except getting to the production engineering stage. We will continue to earn money for food and bills with day jobs, and even running costs and expenses for Nebulous Technologies we're pay for out of our own pockets.</p>
<p>The goal of $24,000 is what we need to get most of the way there. If we get more, then we have loads of plans for how we can make it a bigger success. If we get less, then we can still do it, but we know it's going to take longer and be less effective.</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>We want you to get involved, contribute if you can, and above all spread the word if you think toys deserve better.</p></div>","Check the Updates to:

<p><br/><strong>Revitalization Campaign</strong><br/>At present, the Sleepless Goat is seeking support from the community to help continue the revitalization of our space. As many of our customers are aware, we have undergone significant renovations in the past months, and we are looking to further improve our space in the coming months.<br/><br/>The money raised during the Revitalization Campaign will be used to acquire new equipment, as well as continue with several renovations already underway.<br/>Some immediate concerns are:</p>
<p><br/>1) Blenders: We are looking to purchase two new commercial blenders in order to make blended drinks- especially smoothies, which are popular during the summer months. Commercial blenders cost in the area of $600.00 each, and at least two will be necessary for effective and efficient service.<br/>2) Washrooms: Our washrooms were renovated at the beginning of the year, however, we recognize that further improvements are necessary. Donated funds will be put towards labour and materials to repair both washrooms.<br/>3) Storefront Sign: The front sign above our entrance is in a rather weathered condition, and needs to be repaired. We would like to restore it to its former glory, with hopes that the improved aesthetic will draw attention to our business.<br/><br/>If money is raised above and beyond our goal, we have many other items that need to be purchased, such as:</p>
<p><br/>- a new cappuccino machine- for faster service and better coffee.<br/>- a POS system- will enable us to better track sales and adapt quickly to customer preferences, as well as directly send orders to the kitchen which will save time.<br/>- repairs to the front entrance- first impressions are important!</p>

We are Bakersfield Burrito Project

We go into the community and feed the hungry and the homeless. We do this without requiring anything of the people we help. No song or dance, just take the food, water or clothing and we ask for nothing in return.
Every Sunday afternoon, we meet at Weill Park on the corner of James and Q Street, assemble burritos from rice, beans, tortillas, cheese (and whatever else is donated that week).

Every Sunday takes about three hours to assemble, and deliver the food we collect through the week.

What We Need & What You Get


We need to get our 501(3)(c)

$500 dollars will help us get through all the processes and paperwork that is needed to file the paperwork to get our non-profit status.
Once we gain our non-profit status, we can request bigger donations from companies and other non-profits that concentrate on helping people in the community. This means being able to solicit donations toward establishing a soup kitchen, or a catering truck to better deliver food into the community.
If we do not reach our goal, all money will be used to purchase more food. Bulk beans, bulk rice goes a long way, and can be stored indefinately until we need it. Please be generous with your donations, for if we go over our goal, we can also use the excess money for food and water.
What do you get? The warm, happy feeling that you are using your money to help a group help local people. Every penny stays within the community in food purchases, and not a red cent goes into any of the members pockets. We use everything to fund feeding people who need food, water and clothing.

We are Agora Collective; a platform that empowers individuals through multi-disciplinary collaborative creation, a gathering space of professionals, driven by the urge to explore new ways of interaction and collaboration in todayâ€™s context. We are dedicated on creating intelligent forms of producing, working and living - artistically, socially and economically.

Our approach to this is looking at the process and not just the final product. Seeking the balance between individuality and collectivity.
Not only an airport of ideas; making bridges, connecting talented and engaged people. Agora is also an incubator; developing and supporting artistical, social, environmental and economical projects.
The Impact
We are re-designing the present.
Concentrating on solutions instead of on problems, Agoraâ€™s mission is to re-think ways of relating to working and living in our actual context. In the process of multidisciplinary co-creation we try to come to creative solutions on actual issues.

And hope to reach as many people as we can with our projects. The impact is making a step forward, together, in a time that its hardly needed. We have been working with what we have, and plan on continuing doing this, but we are growing fast and need the financial support in this moment to keep up with this growth in a healthy way.

What We Need & What You Get
Basically what we are asking for is two months of our rent. Rent that is really weighing on our shoulders and making it hard for us to move forward. We are asking for financial help to give us some more breathing space. So you are directly helping us finance our ideas and keep this space going.
Our ongoing projects:Currently we are working on several projects including:Agora Business Incubation Program is a new business incubation program in Berlin focusing on aiding Innovative Social, Educational and Sustainable startups to develop their ideas into functioning businesses.Agora Residency Program aims to provide an opportunity for creative development inall areas of the arts.The program facilitates comfortable studios, living spaces, contact with Berlin based artists and Agoraâ€™s active community offering discussions, media exposure and the opportunity for creative development in a thriving collective environment. CSA projectCommunity Supported Agriculture consists of a community of individuals who pledge support to a farm operation so that the farmland becomes, either legally or spiritually, the community's farm, with the growers and consumers providing mutual support and sharing the risks and benefits of food production.
Helping us does not mean only in a financial way, we hope you can see the cause of this, exchange ideas with us and who knows, be part of this movement. Your help means a lot to us and we will try to show this gratitude in the best possible way, so please, check out our perks, and if you just want to contribute in a smaller way, every dollar counts. The idea is that we do this together with as many people as we can reach!

<h3>Solar Lights for Haiti</h3>
<p>In 2007 I came up with an idea that I thought would change the world and maybe its still not to late. I invented and patented a product called a solar sign light:</p>
<p>My name is Thomas Meyers the inventor of Sslite.</p>
<p>I want to turn what was a financial disaster for me into something that can help people living in a real life natural disaster in Haiti. Instead of looking at these things everyday feeling sorry for myself and wondering what if I did this or that differently, I just want to give them to people in need. I am doing it to put it all behind me. The whole Sslite project was a disaster. It cost me my home at the time and nearly my marriage. I want to turn what’s left into beacons of hope for people I have never met and at the same time help me to heal</p>
<p>By donating to this cause or by purchasing a solar sign light you will help people living in the dark. As Americans we really don’t know what dark is. I can go out my front door at midnight and because there are street lights and porch lights it never really gets dark. Just the ambient light from metro Atlanta reflecting off the atmosphere makes it less than dark. Please help me help others out of the dark.</p>
<p>Make a donation to help people living without out power or lights in the poorest part of the world. All I ask is to help with shipping, I will donate 850 solar lights.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>I need to raise $8500</strong></p>
<p>That is $10 to ship 850 sign lights to people in Haiti:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding is going directly to shipping cost!</li>
<li>For every light you purchase I will ship 2 free Haiti!</li>
<li>Not only will you be helping people living in the dark but help me feel like I did not do all of this for nothing.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact will be felt</strong></p>
<p>We are so blessed in this country. Even the people struck by Sandy have begun to see things starting to improve. Little by little streets are being cleared and power is coming back on. In Haiti nothing has changed and nothing will change in any time soon if ever. Just imagine what that must feel like?</p>
<p>I don’t know a better way donate $10 than this.</p>
<p>If you have any doubt about my sincerity or my product please visit <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.uspto.gov</a> and search my patent number 7,357,527.</p>
<p>Help me turn my financial disaster into helping others deal with a natural disaster.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Solar Lights for Haiti
In 2007 I came up with an idea that I thought would change the world and maybe its still not to late. I invented and patented a product called a solar sign light:
My name is Thomas Meyers the inventor of Sslite.
I want to turn what was a financial disaster for me into something that can help people living in a real life natural disaster in Haiti. Instead of looking at these things everyday feeling sorry for myself and wondering what if I did this or that differently, I just want to give them to people in need. I am doing it to put it all behind me. The whole Sslite project was a disaster. It cost me my home at the time and nearly my marriage. I want to turn what’s left into beacons of hope for people I have never met and at the same time help me to heal
By donating to this cause or by purchasing a solar sign light you will help people living in the dark. As Americans we really don’t know what dark is. I can go out my front door at midnight and because there are street lights and porch lights it never really gets dark. Just the ambient light from metro Atlanta reflecting off the atmosphere makes it less than dark. Please help me help others out of the dark.
Make a donation to help people living without out power or lights in the poorest part of the world. All I ask is to help with shipping, I will donate 850 solar lights.  
 

I need to raise $8500
That is $10 to ship 850 sign lights to people in Haiti:

The funding is going directly to shipping cost!
For every light you purchase I will ship 2 free Haiti!
Not only will you be helping people living in the dark but help me feel like I did not do all of this for nothing.
The Impact will be felt
We are so blessed in this country. Even the people struck by Sandy have begun to see things starting to improve. Little by little streets are being cleared and power is coming back on. In Haiti nothing has changed and nothing will change in any time soon if ever. Just imagine what that must feel like?
I don’t know a better way donate $10 than this.
If you have any doubt about my sincerity or my product please visit www.uspto.gov and search my patent number 7,357,527.
Help me turn my financial disaster into helping others deal with a natural disaster.

<h3>Giant Leap of Faith!</h3>
<p>I am a small business owner of a photographic services company in Virginia Beach, VA. A career in the arts has always been my dream.  It wasn't until my family lost the most amazing woman that this planet has ever known, that I realized how important photographs are to the memory. </p>
<p><br/>After working in serveral portrait studios, for several different companies, they all had one thing in common.  SALES.  Finally, I gained the confidence, took a giant leap of faith, and started working on my business full-time in February.  I have made it my goal to never turn any family or couple away because of a tight budget.  Now that I have built a steady clientele; consisting of wonderful, supportive, return customers, it is time to upgrade my equipment and provide them with better quality images!</p>
<p><br/>I started this ""Indiegogo"" campaign in search of funds for better quality equipment to service the largest military community in the world!  These people deserve it!  There is no feeling greater than providing tears of joy for a 80 year old man's birthday or a mother or father overseas getting to be a part of their child's first birthday!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Break-Down</h3>
<p>Here is a ""Reader's Digest"" version of the shopping cart of neccessary tools my company needs to make it all happen.  My poor 8 year old camera is in need of a replacement and to best service my clientele, purchasing the Canon 5D Mark ii is of the upmost importance. Along with that, a 50 mm lense to provide the best portraits, a wide-angle lense for those wonderful weddings, and a fish-eye lense for those fun, creative shots.  Also, on the list are new lights and a backdrop or two, in order to decrease costs of studio rentals. </p>
<p><br/>The equipment above will cost just under $10,000 for everything. The remaining will be used for flyers and promotions for my upcoming Family Portrait Month in October. A portion of the preceeds from all family sessions in October will be donated to Operation Smile!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
Your contribution will go towards solidifying memories for all types of families in beautiful, quality portraits.  You are also helping a small business support our troops and charities! </div>

<p> </p>
<p>Bahia is located on the east coast of Brasil, right below the Equator. For the past thirty years my family and I have owned this property. Years ago we had our amazing artist friends like Keith Haring, Tseng Kwong Chi, Kenny Scharf, Bruno Schmidt, Steve Muller, come to the house and enjoy and make art. This is such an inspiring place, and it has become a treasure for artists and those who love and appreciate art and nature.</p>
<p><span>We have eight amazing structures built on the land. As </span><span>the global community is going through a fine tuning, we see the need for a communal safe space that can be used by artists, teachers, and healers. We want to make an educational environment geared toward bringing back the consciousness of the mind, using art therapies (movement, visual art, music) to create brighter and wiser human beings. It has been proven that human beings must be creative to feel complete. Around Paraiso Verde, the main concern of the community is to survive on a daily basis. They are not aware of their own creativity. Creating a space will bring back the community awareness to the region and the spark and joy of life that creativity brings.</span></p>

<p>An oca is a typical type of habitat/ living space of indigenous people. They are typically built collectively with the help of several members of the tribe.

<p><span><strong>The Story of Urban Run Club</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Back in 2008 a few friends got together with the bright idea of forming a community running group, fit for all ages, shapes, and different. Here we are 4 years later and we are still running. We didn't really think we would last this long when we started, but here we are. Our daily goal is to inspire people to live healthier lives through exercise and being actively visible in our neighborhoods. Yes we are Urban Run Club, however we support all types of activity. Running, walking, healthy eating, camping, kayaking, hiking, anything to get us moving is on the list including dancing. Join our one song dance party every Friday at 11 am where ever you are to get your heart rate up and oxygen moving head to toe. </span></p>
<p><span>As the organizer, I have participated in many different types of races, some short distances, some team races, and loads of fun neighborhood races. in talking to a great number of our run club members I have started to hear a good number of our runners state they would love to do particular races, but the races cost too much money. I myself slacked off a steady race calendar because I realized those race bibs add up at the end of the year and it wasn't always been in my budget, so I understand other run club members when they share their honest feed back about their light race calendars.</span></p>
<p><span>By reaching our goal we will take 24 racers to 3 different races to challenge themselves in ways they may have never dreamed about. All three races are multi day events and require lots of planning and more funds than your average neighborhood 5k. The lasting memories and the feeling of great accomplishment will forever be on the list of some of the best experiences to date for most of the team members.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p><span>So, here is where your help comes in. We need $5500. Race registration is $2840 for three races, the remaining $2660 is part of what it cost to make the race actually happen...rent vans, hotel rooms, van supplies, gas for vans, and other small cost. We have organized many teams before and the calculations are spot on.   Just think, you might look up in your town and see a pack of smiling runners and a walker or two and say to yourself, ""I helped make this happen!"" make sure you check out the perks!</span></p>
<p><span>Here are links to the races:</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Why Does This Matter?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Urban Run Club has always been a free running group to join. Over the years we have attracted thousands of runners from the Metro Atlanta area.  We have staged our own free race. We have been very successful with only missing 3 Tuesdays in 4 years (Due to ice on the ground and 2 lightning storms.) We have consistently provided support to runners during races. We want to help a hand full of people feel the joy of the race. A race they may have never been able to join.</span></p>
<p>At the end of the day, by supporting this campaign will help a number of racers enter races the can not afford to run. Just because you may not have seen any of these runners take first place in races, they still run hard and are dedicated to living healthy and this always earns reward. </p>
<p><span><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></span></p>

<h3>Mobile technology is integrated into everyday life all over the world; Help us show people how to make the most of it!</h3>
<p>We are organizing a workshop and hackathon that’s going to take place during the <a href=""http://www.appropriatetech.net/?q=content/5th-international-conference-appropriate-technology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""5th ICAT"">5th International Conference on Appropriate Technology</a> in Pretoria, South Africa in late November.</p>
<p>The goal of the workshop is to give participants an introduction to mobile tech applications that enable new approaches to issues such as urban and community planning, economics and markets, political participation, and personal and environmental health.  We want participants to leave with ideas of what’s possible and what some of the successes and pitfalls people have experienced are.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to get workshop participants interested in incorporating mobile tech into their own appropriate technology work. We'll arm them with information about projects that we (the organizers and panel presenters) and others have done, and also give them practice in constructing a project idea and working with mobile developers during a <a href=""http://icathack.eventbrite.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hackathon</a> to start to bring it to life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What We'll Do</h3>
<p>We need funding to cover several aspects of these events:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to bring workshop presentors and facilitators who represent a variety of project areas and target users.  We need about $2400 for travel and lodging.</li>
<li>The rest of the funds will go toward video documentation production, and hackathon operational expenses -- materials, meals, and awards.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, funds will first go toward travel for the workshop presenters.  Facilitating a good workshop experience is highest on our priority list.</p>
<p>From these events, we are going to produce:</p>
<ul>
<li>A website cataloging the ideas and applications developed as a part of the workshop and hackathon. The site will also contains detailed information about the proceedings during the workshop and the hackathon.</li>
<li>
<strong>If we surpass $4000</strong> we will also produce a video documenting the workshop and hackathon.</li>
<li>All donors from $25 up will be listed in the credits on the site. Donors at the $100 level also get special mention in our workshop materials.</li>
<li>Funders over $500 will receive their name and logo of choosing in a dedicated space on the site.</li>

<h3>Introducing the brains behind GrowSmart....</h3>
<p>Hi.I'm Saren - a busy mother of three from New Zealand and I care about what I feed my kids because I want them to have the best start in life. The problem is with life being so busy it can be hard to find a quick snack for them that </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1. They all like to eat</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">2. That isn't full of the usual nasty chemicals which makes convenience snacks for kids taste good. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">So I came up with a solution. A nutritional and TASTY biscuit made from New Zealand's finest milk powder and manuka honey. </p>
<h3>Tell us about the biscuit! </h3>
<p>I'm no newbie when it comes to business so what was once just a pipe-dream in my mind is now a reality. With the help of a well known NZ food technology company this biscuit has already been produced, tasted and ENJOYED in a test quantity. The biscuits featured in the video are the REAL DEAL!!! They are ready to go and the kids really do LOVE them. </p>
<p>They contain</p>
<p>*35% New Zealand's finest milk powder - desirable for it's high calcium content to meet the needs of growing strong bones and minds! </p>
<p>*New Zealand Manuka honey - a uniquely flavoured honey known for it's healing and health properties. </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What's next?</span></h3>
<p>The next step?? Well, this is what I need your help with. I really want to share this little slice of New Zealand goodness with families around the world. The biggest step is to do a larger production and establish our distribution channels and marketing to ensure we meet our target sales and fund the ongoing production of the biscuit factory. This is going to take a lot of work and require a significant amount of funding. With your help I know we can get there!</p>
<p>We are already in negotiation with a major food chain in Australasia and a second in Asia. To get across the globe we are going to need to employ two full-time staff members and complete the next round of marketing and packaging for export. </p>

</ul></div>","Short Summary
A honeymoon in hell with a 6 months (Flat -rent) contract


My self and my wife young couple (age 26-20) married three months ago. To have a private and independent life we worked very hard to pull funds together and rent a flat (no honeymoon). We bounced back to work a day after marriage. My wife juggle two jobs together working 70 hours a week and my self longer shift sales assistant so that our rent can be paid. Unknown to us the flat we thought could be a home for us has damaged floor above us and sign of water leakage, both were covered up with fresh white paint before we moved in and sign 6 months contract. 

 


We started to notice foot step which later become a very loud kick/noise from the top floor because any step made above us no matter how slight it was became a kick or a cracking- wood- sound- like. We were unable to sleep without using earplugs which became uncomfortable. It was later that I went to the floor above us and realise the floor was in a bad shape/ damaged and our rooms start to show sign of water leakages coming out of the white paint.


I develop constant headache and nose bleed follow.


Our marriage almost got to a break up point because we were always in a tense mood because of that.


Our landlord claim no wrong doing and try to keep us in base on contract signed, all these with the agent support and backing.
  


We decided to put together online an editable database of tenants experiences in flats and tenants experiences with Landlords and Agents so that things which are not visible during flat viewing can be looked upon online before another tenant become a victim like us.

 


This will help lots of tenants with independent information about the flat they are moving in


It will also keep both the landlords and agents in check . They will for once know there is an online database where all their acts and misconduct can be reported.
 


Your help raising the funds will greatly help us achieve these aims and goals which will in return save a whole lots of tenants like us the hassle and save them from become a victim


What You Will Get:
I am an up and coming songwriter and performer. I write about social problems and inequality. Video above.
Copy paste this link for my work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5doM8oR6fg


I have a written piece about our experience in this flat which will be recorded


Donors will be given a free download link for the finished song and opportunity to read the lyrics and contribute before final recording. 


Your name on the websites.

Albinism
is an inherited condition characterized by a lack of melanin in the skin, hair
and eyes, usually accompanied by impaired vision.  Albinism occurs in Tanzania at a
rate that is ten times higher than the rate in developed countries.  People
with albinism (PWA) in Tanzania are stigmatized and marginalized by their
families and communities, and sometimes killed at birth.This is due largely to superstitions that albinism is a curse from God, albino body parts bring wealth and that PWAs are born after a woman sleeps with the devil. Since 2007 in NW Tanzania, albinos have been hunted, mutilated and even killed for their body parts.   In that time, the murder of more than one hundred albinos has been documented, in addition to hundreds of mutilations and grave-robberies.                                       Diana, a 17-year-old Tanzanian PWA, is finishing her final year of high school and hopes to attend university. She is also a talented netball player.
The Plan

To date, governing bodies have not been effective at prosecuting these crimes, so alternative actions must be taken. We worked with Albino human rights groups in Tanzania, led by Sister Martha – an Albino herself and stalwart defender of Albino rights in Tanzania, to design and begin implementation of a participatory media project.Goals:(1) Sensitize
communities to the issues faced by PWA through a video created by PWA
themselves, telling their stories in ways that humanize them among people who
believe they are a curse from God and question their humanness;
(2) Educate
communities about the facts and myths regarding albinism, facilitate
integration of new information and implications for the future;
(3) Destigmatize
albinism and enhance the integration of PWAs within villages, and sometimes
even within their own families;(4) Help give PWAs in Tanzania voice to tell their stories.
The
program launched last year with focus groups aimed at identifying the root
causes for the many problems albinos face. Focus group participants said that
the best way to improve their security and debunk these myths is to demonstrate
to their communities that they too, are human. We went to Tanzania and led a storytelling workshop with albinos and traditional healers. The workshop participants then interviewed each other, off the record, to identify the stories that best address the root causes of their marginalization. Finally, we turned on the cameras, and recorded these interviews, with albino interviewers.                                               Start of storytelling workshop with PWAs and natural healers.
Moving ForwardWhen we finish editing
the video (with feedback from our Tanzanian partners), Sister Martha,
traditional healers, and other albinos will travel to 40 villages along Lake
Victoria to screen the video and engage in community discussion to:
(1) Ground
people in their own experiences of albinism;
(2) Offer
a new, humanizing vision of people with albinism through a video created by and
featuring PWA telling their own stories, as well as a few facts (versus myths)
presented by credible sources;
(3) Facilitate
the processing and integration of new information through questions and
discussion, and;
(4) Assist
in articulating changes and exploring implications for the future.
The Impact
This
video is a key to helping change the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about
albinos in Tanzania.                   Saiede and Sada are brother and sister. Saiede runs a successful fish market and Sada owns a small business selling baskets and raw weaving materials out of her home. 
What We Need
After
we left Tanzania, Sister Martha became gravely ill (but is slowly recovering!).
She volunteered to translate the fourteen interviews from Swahili to English,
but is too weak to do so. We need funds to pay a professional translator to
take on this work. 
We
will also pay for the production of a short animated segment explaining how

Hi! I'm Lucy.
I'm a longstanding member of the Dreamwidth community, where folks know me as randomling. Over the past two years, I've been volunteering as a developer for this excellent open-source project: contributing patches, writing documentation, cheerleading, and holding the hands of new programmers (or “babydevs”, as we like to call them in Dreamwidth slang) through their first steps towards coding.
I'm relatively new to software development myself. I was originally trained in linguistics, and have a professional background in administration. I've always had an interest in computers and especially the web, so when the opportunity to learn to code – and help out my favourite site at the same time – came up, I jumped at the chance. Dreamwidth has been incredibly supportive.
I've now been offered a fantastic opportunity: to attend my very first technical conference with some of my fellow Dreamwidth developers. I'm one of the volunteers that Dreamwidth has chosen to fly out to Austin, Texas for YAPC::NA and the associated Dreamwidth hackathon. My contributions to this project will be enhanced enormously by this opportunity to attend a conference focusing on the language Dreamwidth is written in – but unfortunately, the financial side is a bit tricky.
Health issues mean I am not able to work, and the current UK Government's attitude to sickness and disability means I was recently turned down for benefits I am entitled to. I am appealing the decision, but this will take an enormous amount of time, effort and stress.
To get the most out of this opportunity, I'm asking for your help. Dreamwidth is generously paying for my flight, accommodation and conference registration, but my lack of income means that I will struggle to feed myself while I'm out there (my family are kindly taking care of me financially at home) – never mind attend the lunchtime and evening social events that are a key benefit of attending a professional conference.
With your help, I'll be able to invest more effort and more productivity into Dreamwidth – and any leftover funds will be donated straight back to the project, to support other volunteers having a tough time.
What I Need & What You Get
What I Need
I'll be in Austin for 7 days. $500 should cover:


$50 a day. This should be more than enough to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner, a reasonable contribution to gas and car rental (I'll be making use of someone else's rented car), and any incidental expenses that might come up.


$150 emergency money. This obviously won't cover a major medical emergency, but it'll be helpful if unexpected expenses come up. I'm hoping that I won't need this extra money, and I'll be able to feed it straight back into the Dreamwidth project.

What You Get
When it comes to offering perks, I have two major skills to use. One, obviously, is programming. The other is writing.


If you're a Dreamwidth user

 I'm offering to fix bugs for cash, on a sliding scale! You can pick any one (or several, depending on the amount donate) of the bugs on this list of easy bugs, and I will hack away and get them fixed! Obviously this is most relevant if you use Dreamwidth on a regular basis, because this has the potential to improve your experience of the site.


If you like stories

 I'm offering to write a story for you – one you help to create yourself! This could be a fan fiction story (have a look at my list of fandoms) or an original one. Provide me with a prompt, a paragraph about what you like, or a list of things you'd like to see included, and I'll write something just for you based on your idea.
The Impact
Getting the most out of this conference will make a huge difference to me – and, I think, to the users of Dreamwidth.
Programming is my dream job. I love the challenge of trying to understand a forest of code, or of working out how to make something new behave just the way you want it to. I love looking at a site and being able to point to the features I wrote, and I love the enormous amount of learning that I've done over the past two years. This conference is my first contact with the wider world of professional programming – and I want to make the most of the opportunity. It brings me one step closer to my goal of a career in software development.
I like to think that my participation in the conference, and more importantly the hackathon, will make a difference to Dreamwidth. One bug I'm hoping to devote lots of time to while I'm in Texas is a quick-account-switch system which would make a huge positive difference to many DW users (including myself; then again, it's no surprise that programmers like to scratch their own itches). A fellow programmer has already done lots of work on this, and it would be fantastic to get it up and running.
Ultimately, I want to use my programming skills to change the world. Fully engaging with this conference will really increase my chances of being able to do that – improving my skills, putting me in touch with a wider circle of developers, and broadening my experience.
Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone has the financial wherewithal to donate – but you can still help out! Use the Share tools to tell your friends about the campaign, and boost the signal any way you can. I appreciate every single post and tweet.

<p>Crowdknitting is a <b>social network</b> with an amazing growth potential: sign up, get to know people and become their friend, share and exchange advice, join others in groups, arrange meetings, suggest projects, create events, get people to know you, build a movement... change the world!</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/405005/files/20140302093227-CK_Image_cornice_1.jpg?1393781547"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<h2 style=""color: #8F83C6;""><br/></h2><h2 style=""color: #8F83C6;"">About us</h2>
<p>Crowdknitting is a social network for the knitting lovers and for all those who wish to learn more about this activity; children, teenagers, adults, mothers and grandmothers, schools and companies, creative people or knitter wannabe. A new way of meeting and connecting, a thread that links, creating relationships and new opportunities</p><p style=""display: inline !important;""></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""display: inline !important;"">The name CrowdKnitting is a mixture of the word <em>crowd</em>, an <em>assembly of people</em> and a word often used in the marketing field to indicate something that implies sharing and collaboration, and the word <em>knitting</em>, an activity we all enjoy doing.</p><p>Thus, the original goal of CrowdKnitting was to create collective and shared yarn bombing projects to characterise the urban landscape and support social projects. Almost necessarily, this idea quickly evolved into a knitcommunity; people who make of their passion for knitting a way of expressing themselves and a business opportunity.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/405007/files/20140302093342-IMG_2316_cornice.jpg?1393781622"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<h2 style=""color: #E35E01;"">The Project</h2>
<p>Crowdknitting is a Social
Network which aims at helping the innovation and growth of the
""hand-knitted in Italy"" industry with new ideas and challenges coming
from the variety of its <b>Community</b>.
The social<b> platform</b> goal is to help
its members get in touch with other people in order to create relations and
professional opportunities, a place where individuals with a common interest
can interact with the support of technology.</p>
<p>With this idea in mind, we
created the You4Knitting Project, with the objective of giving stylists,
knitwear designers and creative talents the opportunity to meet colleagues as
well as to find companies interested in buying their work, while giving
companies the possibility of accessing new ideas and creative innovation. </p>
<p>We are thus about to launch an <span>e-commerce<b>
platform based on ideas coming from the community </b>, products that are
handmade by our 'certified knitters'.  </span></p>
<p>Thanks to the You4Knitting project and
to the short distribution chain (community-knitters-customers), everyone will
benefit ; turning a passion into a job, selling high-quality products at a fair
price. </p>
<p>Original handmade items with a soul, <b>recognizable</b> through their own identity
card and specific features.  </p>
<p>Crowdknitting will also become a market
place opened to everyone willing to offer its products.</p>
<p>Every knitter has his/her own history,
but we all share one passion: knitting.</p>
<p>Crowdknitting is not only web!</p>
<p>We started a net of <b>Crowdknit Cafes</b>, a new way of
perceiving knitting, a synthesis between an event and a starting point for the
circulation of a new culture; a group of people who meet to knit and share
ideas and projects, but also promotional events for businesses that see
knitting as an innovative way of <b>socializing.
</b></p>
<p><b>At the moment,
we have 22 Crowdknit Cafes all over Italy, but we dream to see them spread to
other countries too! </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p></p>
<h2 style=""color: #A3C84A;"">What do we need?</h2>
<p></p><p>Crowdknitting is a project based on
highly customized open source technology which needs continuous graphic
development and UI support to make it as user-friendly and intuitive as
possible.</p>
<p>These interventions, that so far we
have financed ourselves, need continuous funding.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the manufacturing of
handmade items designed by our creative talents need an initial investment to
start the production chain. </p><p><b>Therefore, our objectives are:</b></p>
<p>- to implement new modules to
further develop our Social Platform and the Market Place;</p>
<p>- to manufacture at least 2 collections
of handmade clothes in 2014 in order to start off this type of business.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""color: #E35E01;"">Goal:</h2>
<p><b>15.000 EUR</b></p>
<p><b>Why contribute to this project</b></p>
<p>We firmly believe in Crowdknitting;
first of all, for its social nature, meaning that sharing ideas and being a
community are an essential part of it. Secondly, because we believe that
knitting can catalyse economical growth by starting new business processes. </p>
<p><b>What do you get by helping us?</b></p><p>Every single contribution is essential
to us, so we'll be thankful to anyone making a donation, however small. As a
thank you, once you make a donation we will send ou our thank you as follows:</p>

Crowdknitting is a social network with an amazing growth potential: sign up, get to know people and become their friend, share and exchange advice, join others in groups, arrange meetings, suggest projects, create events, get people to know you, build a movement... change the world!
About us
Crowdknitting is a social network for the knitting lovers and for all those who wish to learn more about this activity; children, teenagers, adults, mothers and grandmothers, schools and companies, creative people or knitter wannabe. A new way of meeting and connecting, a thread that links, creating relationships and new opportunitiesThe name CrowdKnitting is a mixture of the word crowd, an assembly of people and a word often used in the marketing field to indicate something that implies sharing and collaboration, and the word knitting, an activity we all enjoy doing.Thus, the original goal of CrowdKnitting was to create collective and shared yarn bombing projects to characterise the urban landscape and support social projects. Almost necessarily, this idea quickly evolved into a knitcommunity; people who make of their passion for knitting a way of expressing themselves and a business opportunity.
The Project
Crowdknitting is a Social
Network which aims at helping the innovation and growth of the
""hand-knitted in Italy"" industry with new ideas and challenges coming
from the variety of its Community.
The social platform goal is to help
its members get in touch with other people in order to create relations and
professional opportunities, a place where individuals with a common interest
can interact with the support of technology.
With this idea in mind, we
created the You4Knitting Project, with the objective of giving stylists,
knitwear designers and creative talents the opportunity to meet colleagues as
well as to find companies interested in buying their work, while giving
companies the possibility of accessing new ideas and creative innovation. 
We are thus about to launch an e-commerce
platform based on ideas coming from the community , products that are
handmade by our 'certified knitters'.  
Thanks to the You4Knitting project and
to the short distribution chain (community-knitters-customers), everyone will
benefit ; turning a passion into a job, selling high-quality products at a fair
price. 
Original handmade items with a soul, recognizable through their own identity
card and specific features.  
Crowdknitting will also become a market
place opened to everyone willing to offer its products.
Every knitter has his/her own history,
but we all share one passion: knitting.
Crowdknitting is not only web!
We started a net of Crowdknit Cafes, a new way of
perceiving knitting, a synthesis between an event and a starting point for the
circulation of a new culture; a group of people who meet to knit and share
ideas and projects, but also promotional events for businesses that see
knitting as an innovative way of socializing.

At the moment,
we have 22 Crowdknit Cafes all over Italy, but we dream to see them spread to
other countries too! 
What do we need?
Crowdknitting is a project based on
highly customized open source technology which needs continuous graphic
development and UI support to make it as user-friendly and intuitive as
possible.
These interventions, that so far we
have financed ourselves, need continuous funding.  
Furthermore, the manufacturing of
handmade items designed by our creative talents need an initial investment to
start the production chain. Therefore, our objectives are:
- to implement new modules to
further develop our Social Platform and the Market Place;
- to manufacture at least 2 collections
of handmade clothes in 2014 in order to start off this type of business.
Goal:
15.000 EUR
Why contribute to this project
We firmly believe in Crowdknitting;
first of all, for its social nature, meaning that sharing ideas and being a
community are an essential part of it. Secondly, because we believe that
knitting can catalyse economical growth by starting new business processes.

</div><p>So... I’m a
foodie.  This gluten free, soy free, dairy free thing is kinda tricky when you’re a foodie at heart.  But let me back up a little.</p>
<p>5 years ago
my body rebelled.  I was in pain, and
swollen, and exhausted... all the time. 
They worked me up for bone cancer... multiple sclerosis... lupus... lyme
disease... negative.</p>
<p>Thankfully :)</p>
<p>But, I still
felt awful.  I couldn’t drag myself out
of bed.  I hurt.  Everywhere. 
Hugs from my kids... hurt.  My
brain was foggy.  My body was
swollen.  They finally settled on
fibromyalgia... with IBS... with ADHD.... with depression.  </p>
<p>And they
medicated me.  A lot.</p>
<p>For the next
3 years symptoms got worse, medications increased, and I gradually lost
me.  I missed myself.  I missed my life.</p>
<p>Then I tried
gluten free eating.</p>
<p>One week
later most of my symptoms were gone.  3
weeks later the medication were gone.  All of them. 
Kicked to the curb.  I had food
testing done and discovered soy and dairy intolerance, too.  I sent them all packing.  After all, they weren’t very nice to me.</p>
<p>I felt alive
again.  Sassy even :)</p>
<p>Which brings
me here.  Baking yummy stuff... ‘cause
I’m a foodie.  A complicated one, but a
foodie none the less.  Everything I bake
is food I miss... soft sandwich buns... chewy sugar cookies... bagels that feel
like a bagel… thick pizza crust.</p>
<p>For the love
of all that is awesome... REAL FOOD! </p>
<p>My hope is to bake more than just food for you, I hope
together we can bring fun back into food. 
When you have a food sensitivity, social events can be isolating.  You can’t share tapas, go in on a pizza,
snitch a bite of pasta.  Food is no
longer a source of social connection... you’re left on the sidelines of the
dinner table, eating plain salad alone.  </p>
<p>My mission is to change all of that.  I envision a bakery and café that serves
amazing gluten free and allergy friendly food so good everyone will want to
share.  I envision an environment that
will make you and your friends want to linger over a cinnamon roll.  A café where you can share a pizza and order
anything from the bakery case.  A place
where everyone will love the food, love the ambience, love the company, and
people with food intolerances will feel safe and free to love food again.</p>
<p>So, now you know my long term vision and mission.  My goal is to be in a position by spring of
2015 to start looking for the perfect location. 
I love the brick and wood buildings of Kalamazoo, where the floors creak
just right and the ceilings are tall, where it’s big enough for a poetry slam
stage, but small enough to hear the whisper of your best friend. </p>
<p>The next phase in this journey is to start producing a few
products through a commercial kitchen. 
Thankfully, Fair Food Matters in Kalamazoo supports a shared commercial
kitchen which I am now a part of.  Pizza
crust and soft sandwich buns will make their debut first to local restaurants
and small grocery stores.  This phase will
further establish the success we’ve enjoyed with our booth at the Farmers’
Market and help finance the next phases leading to a café.  Check out the photo gallery of this campaign!</p>
<p>I love that you’re here, reading this, wanting to share in
this journey with me.  I love that I get
to bake great food for people who have been missing their favorites.  I love when my customers take a bite and say…
“Oh my gosh… this is gluten free??”  </p><p>I
love my customers, I love great food, I love what I do.  You’re support helps me continue to do that,
and helps me head to the next phase…. I can’t wait to get started!</p><div>

<p>This next

expenses and three months of recurring expenses.  We’ll still move forward with this project if
we don’t receive full funding, it will just be at a slower rate and a smaller

</div></div>","What's the Story Mornin' Glory??? 
So... I’m a
foodie.  This gluten free, soy free, dairy free thing is kinda tricky when you’re a foodie at heart.  But let me back up a little.
5 years ago
my body rebelled.  I was in pain, and
swollen, and exhausted... all the time. 
They worked me up for bone cancer... multiple sclerosis... lupus... lyme
disease... negative.
Thankfully :)
But, I still
felt awful.  I couldn’t drag myself out
of bed.  I hurt.  Everywhere. 
Hugs from my kids... hurt.  My
brain was foggy.  My body was
swollen.  They finally settled on
fibromyalgia... with IBS... with ADHD.... with depression.  
And they
medicated me.  A lot.
For the next
3 years symptoms got worse, medications increased, and I gradually lost
me.  I missed myself.  I missed my life.
Then I tried
gluten free eating.
One week
later most of my symptoms were gone.  3
weeks later the medication were gone.  All of them. 
Kicked to the curb.  I had food
testing done and discovered soy and dairy intolerance, too.  I sent them all packing.  After all, they weren’t very nice to me.
I felt alive
again.  Sassy even :)
Which brings
me here.  Baking yummy stuff... ‘cause
I’m a foodie.  A complicated one, but a
foodie none the less.  Everything I bake
is food I miss... soft sandwich buns... chewy sugar cookies... bagels that feel
like a bagel… thick pizza crust.
For the love
of all that is awesome... REAL FOOD! 
My hope is to bake more than just food for you, I hope
together we can bring fun back into food. 
When you have a food sensitivity, social events can be isolating.  You can’t share tapas, go in on a pizza,
snitch a bite of pasta.  Food is no

anything from the bakery case.  A place
where everyone will love the food, love the ambience, love the company, and
people with food intolerances will feel safe and free to love food again.
So, now you know my long term vision and mission.  My goal is to be in a position by spring of

I love the brick and wood buildings of Kalamazoo, where the floors creak

</h3> <p>Earl Foolish is a small independent jewelry brand, based in Sweden but doing business worldwide. </p>
<p>The company was formed in November 2013, and all tech going into the company was things that I already had, like a laptop, a drawing tablet and a printer.

<p>And then shit went down.</p>
<p>The 2011 MacBook Pro that has been the work horse in all this, crapped out. Google reveals that it is a common problem with that generation of the MBP, but Apple won't institute a replacement program and the only solution is to replace the logic board.

<p>I have an older replacement laptop that is decent for day to day use like staying on top of orders, checking emails, etc - but it's not cut out for any heavier work, and since all jewelry is designed in photoshop and illustrator,<b> it's put a stop to the creative process</b>. This right in the middle of my work on the upcoming collection for the fall/winter season 2014, as well as other projects. Not only that, but all work files, from jewelry designs to promotional material, is stuck on the harddrive of the broken down MBP with no other backups (my fault that, I know)</p>

<h3>Our Story:</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Right now, you or someone you know and care about may be confronting experiences commonly labeled as mental illness. For some, mainstream strategies are effective. But far too many of us wind up alienated by mainstream responses, rather than feeling seen and supported. If you’re like us, you know someone, or many people, who have struggled to find care that resonates with their experiences, particularly if they’re a person of color, a woman, LGBTQTS-identified, disabled, or working class, among many other marginalized identities.</span></p>
<p><b>And we know that you, like us, want to see a world where everyone can be well, no matter their status, abilities, or identities.</b></p>
<p><b>You believe that alternatives are not just possible, but necessary.</b></p>
<p><b>So do we. At The Icarus Project, we’ve spent the past twelve years creating radical alternatives to the mental health mainstream. We’ve seen first hand how community support and tools like Mad Maps (described in the video above), can heal individuals, and how in turn individuals can transform the traumatizing conditions of their communities. And we need your help to keep making this life-saving work happen.</b></p>
<p>With 15,000+ members in our online communities, and 15 local chapters across the country, we have been a lifeline for thousands of people who feel stigmatized by conventional mental health approaches. We equip our membership with resources like Mad Maps - wellness documents that help chart out paths to healing - in ways that uplift mutual aid and self-determination.</p>
<p>Today, the Icarus Project is at an exciting and critical moment. Your contribution will help us to keep centering people of color in our leadership and confronting oppression within our movement, in a long-term decolonization process. With your support, our Mad Maps program will become more ambitious and more impactful than ever before. Inspired by participatory action research, Mad Maps are in part a collection and compilation of hundreds of our members’ strategies for navigating and improving on a mad world. And over the the next year, we will produce four Mad Map guides that examine the intersections between madness and issues of oppression, intergenerational trauma, personal experiences, and collective liberation. And we can’t do any of this without collaborators like you.</p>
<p>Your support will help us to research, produce, and print Mad Maps, and to enhance our other programs, especially capacity building for racial justice and community organizing work at the local level. As we move to a model of community investment and greater sustainability, and work to decolonize Icarus, we need your participation to ensure that Mad Maps - and all of our essential, life-changing programs - continue to thrive.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What You'll Get:</h3> <p></p>

<p></p>
<ul>

<div>Additionally, we will be combining all 4 guides and releasing them in book form, slated for June of 2016. The design, editing, printing, and distribution costs total $4,000.<p></p>

<p>These figures don't incorporate the many hours of staff time that go into gathering information and transforming it into meaningful, cohesive guides, just the bare bones costs of getting them out into the world. We thank you for helping us to make these publications a reality!</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Who We Are:</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>The Icarus Project is a support network, media project, and social change organization by and for people who experience the world in ways that are often diagnosed as mental illness. We advance social justice by fostering mutual aid practices that reconnect healing and collective liberation. We transform ourselves through transforming the world around us.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Want:</h3> <p><span>The Icarus Project seeks to overcome the limitations of a world determined to label, categorize, and sort human behavior. We envision a new culture that allows the space and freedom for exploring different states of being, and recognizes that breakdown can be the entrance to breakthrough. We aim to create a language that is so vast and rich that it expresses the infinite diversity of human experiences. We demand more options in understanding and navigating emotional distress and we want everyone to have access to these options, regardless of status, ability, or identity.</span><br/></p>

Where Your Donations Are Going:
We want to be as transparent as possible about what your donations are actually going to support. Each Mad Maps guide, 4 in all, will cost $2,750 to design and print, for a total of $11,000:


Design & Layout: $500
Artwork: $500
Editing: $250
Printing: $1,500

Additionally, we will be combining all 4 guides and releasing them in book form, slated for June of 2016. The design, editing, printing, and distribution costs total $4,000.

These figures don't incorporate the many hours of staff time that go into gathering information and transforming it into meaningful, cohesive guides, just the bare bones costs of getting them out into the world. We thank you for helping us to make these publications a reality!

    Who We Are: 
The Icarus Project is a support network, media project, and social change organization by and for people who experience the world in ways that are often diagnosed as mental illness. We advance social justice by fostering mutual aid practices that reconnect healing and collective liberation. We transform ourselves through transforming the world around us.

    What We Want: The Icarus Project seeks to overcome the limitations of a world determined to label, categorize, and sort human behavior. We envision a new culture that allows the space and freedom for exploring different states of being, and recognizes that breakdown can be the entrance to breakthrough. We aim to create a language that is so vast and rich that it expresses the infinite diversity of human experiences. We demand more options in understanding and navigating emotional distress and we want everyone to have access to these options, regardless of status, ability, or identity.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In addition to raising funds to operate the fundraiser, we are also looking to raise money to help publish our Funnies book.  The years of hard work and creative thoughts put into this book are just waiting to be released to the public.  Without donations, this book might have to lie in the dark for a while longer as people yearn for its release.  The backs of toilets will remain barren while the book basket beside the toilet overflows with the dusty remains of Reader’s Digest long forgotten as the reader waits for the much anticipated arrival of their shiny new CAPS Funnies bathroom reading material!</p>One of the biggest challenges with a small campaign like ours is getting the word out there.  With YOUR help, we can spread the word about this campaign, raise the funds we need, and raise awareness about conditions that have been locked behind kitchen pantries and bathroom doors for too long. Through your donations and sharing this campaign with your friends and families, we can also boost our ticket sales to make this the best birthday fundraiser ever!<p></p>
<p><b>Overcoming the Dumps:</b></p>
<p></p>In order to make this fundraiser as big of a success as we can, we are working together as a team to try and bring in as much local support as possible.  We have a very dedicated and hardworking group of local volunteers that vary in specialities ranging from artists, scholars, media and business managers.  But what matter more than any of that is our passion.  This project is very close to our hearts &amp; our determination to see this through will see us overcome any hurdles that may try to slow us down.  But we know we aren’t invincible superheros and we need your help to make this possible.<ul></ul>

<p>We started out with a dream to keep bees and a great old friend gave us the tools to do just that. We started with one single hive and have grown to 5 hives. It doesn't seem like a whole lot of growth, but for us, small has been better. We maintain the health and happiness of our hives by natural means and never introduce unnatural weirdness into our hives via feed or medication for any reason. That does not mean we do not feed our bees in the fall or whenever they need it and that also does not mean we don't medicate our hives if they catch a cold...it just means we use natural methods; feeding them sugar syrup or honey they produced the season before and treating them with essential oils and other preventative methods that benefit the bees when they are ill.  Our bees and other fabulous busy little pollinators are free to graze on our wide variety of fruit producing trees, various berry bushes and plants, medicinal wildflowers, veggie blossoms and herbs. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our love of bees and all things natural brought us to realize the amazing health benefits of honey and other hive products both internally and on the surface of our skin which in turn led us to learn the different medicinal properties of the herbs and flowers our bees were foraging upon. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> All of our growing practices are done without the use of insecticides, pesticides, herbicides or any kind of harmful chemicals for that matter  so our bees are happy and healthy!!!  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our love also led us to realize just how important bees and other pollinators are to life on Earth!  Honey bees account for 80% of all insect pollination; without such pollination we would see a dramatic decline in the available fruits and vegetables that depend on pollinators.  We have already began to see such a decline due to the ever declining numbers of healthy bees.

We will have a place that will be a positive impact on our community!  We have many programs to help put fruit trees and raw honey in the hands of local families.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Fruit

trees and following agroeconomic and apicentric practices ensures food independence for future generations long after we are
gone and can serve as a remembrance and our foresight to our kids and grand
kids as they walk and enjoy the fruits of their labor.  My kids will walk with their kids and pick
fruit from the trees we planted together long after we are gone and there is an
indescribable feeling of security that comes with that.  It could be the best investment you ever make; an investment in yourself, in the Earth, in our pollinators, and in future generations.

from 100% dependence on large box stores and reward you with the pride and satisfaction
that comes with that.  Planting fruit
trees and following agroeconomic and apicentric practices ensures food independence for future generations long after we are
gone and can serve as a remembrance and our foresight to our kids and grand
kids as they walk and enjoy the fruits of their labor.  My kids will walk with their kids and pick
fruit from the trees we planted together long after we are gone and there is an
indescribable feeling of security that comes with that.  It could be the best investment you ever make; an investment in yourself, in the Earth, in our pollinators, and in future generations. The best time to plant and grow is 10 years ago and today.  
As a big thank you we are offering perks! These perks come from our apiary! They are produced by the people and bees of Dancing Be Apiary right here in Eatonville, Washington! We are as organic as nature allows! So you are guaranteed products free from harmful chemicals and other unnatural weirdness and produced and harvested using organic means! All materials and ingredients we are not able to grow ourselves are purchased from local businesses who's mottos on organic and sustainable farming mirror that of our own! It is important to us that we provide you with only the most healthful products because as we always say ""You are what you eat and healthy bellies feed healthy minds!""
And please remember...just because you cannot make a monetary donation does not mean you can't contribute to our cause! The power of word-of-mouth is an amazing thing!!! So SHARE SHARE SHARE!!!
In the event we are unable to reach our goal, 100% of the funds will go into an interest bearing account where they will patiently await the day when they are put towards the end goal!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>After reaching our goal in a mere 3 days, thanks to unprecedented support from our friends and followers of our work, we realised the potential to raise more money to bring our end goal of equipping ourselves for more types of jewellery production that bit closer was very much within our grasp. Rather than editing the mission statement we started out with, here is an update of what we are hoping to raise and what it will be put towards!</div>
<div>We are now aiming to raise $1500. The final goal is to be fully equipped with tools and materials with which to begin production of sterling silver jewellery, alongside our upcoming copper collection. The additional $800 will be allocated as follows:</div>
<div>- $450 will be used to buy in a decent bench tool selection. This will by no means be entirely comprehensive but it will certainly be a strong starting point and more than enough to enable us to make a start on our jewellery and altar tool collection.</div>
<div>- $200 will be used to buy in soldering equipment.</div>
<div>- $ 150 will be used to buy in a small amount of silver with which to begin making.</div>
<div>We could set our goal higher and list off countless items we could certainly use, but we do not wish to work our business that way. The whole idea of this campaign is to afford the kit to enable us to produce new products, the profits of which will then be used to expand our business and our product line. We have built up what we have from the ground so far and intend to continue expanding and growing through hard work and giving back. So, once again, any help we can garner will be much appreciated!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are a husband and wife small business specialising in beautiful, magical and functional handmade and natural items. From candles to crystals, incenses to spell kits, we cater to an array of different needs. Whether you need altar or ritual supplies, wonderful, high quality crystal and mineral specimens, or even just beautifully scented, handmade candles to enrich your home, we have it all!</p>
<p>We often receive requests to add jewellery to our product list, and with a background in jewellery design and manufacture, it is something we are passionate about and keen to bring to our business. As we are building our business up from nothing, we need to find funding in order to add new product lines to our repertoire that require special equipment to make. We are looking to buy in an electroplating system, tools, chemicals, precious metals and gems to work with in order to breathe life into our vision of beautiful, unusual and functional jewellery, in keeping with our existing product line.</p>
<p>With any money we raise from this campaign, we intend to buy in the equipment we need in order to make this dream a reality. The ability to revive our passion for jewellery design and manufacture, add a new facet of creative expression to our business and open the door to many new and beautiful products not just limited to jewellery would mean the absolute world to us and, we hope, our customers as well. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have worked out exactly what we need to get started. The amount we have decided to aim for is $700. This will go towards the following:</p> <ul> <li>Electroplating system and tools- $300</li> <li>Materials, findings and packaging supplies- $200</li> <li>Crystals and minerals to work with beyond what we already have in stock- $200</li> </ul>
<div>Our goal is to buy in the equipment we need in order to start making jewellery using some of our favourite materials such as copper (for its health benefits and magical properties), crystals and semi-precious gemstones. We eventually wish to incorporate sterling silver, gold and precious gemstones as well but we are starting out with the basics in order to establish ourselves and work our way up from there. Once we start selling our initial creations, we will use the profits from those to buy in more equipment, training and materials.</div>
<div>We have put together a list of very exciting perks for our contributors. We have numerous discount code options for anyone who might like to do a bit of shopping in our Etsy store, including a 10% code that never expires! We have taken some of our most popular products and services and added extras to them or set a special Indiegogo campaign lower price, and we have decided that our very first 10 pieces of copper and natural crystal jewellery that we make will be super limited edition exclusives, just for those who buy the jewellery perk. We are particularly excited about that one.</div>
<div>Any funds we raise via this campaign will go towards our jewellery project, so even if we do not reach our goal of $700, we will still use the proceeds that we do take to buy in the equipment and materials required. Our goal is set at this amount so that we can afford to buy in the things we need to make an immediate start. Of course, if all goes well and we end up reaching, or even exceeding, our goal, we will buy in everything we need right away. If we do exceed our goal, we will be able to start moving on to the other materials that we plan to add in future that little bit quicker.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Our project represents something extremely important, not just to us but also to our customers and contributors for a number of reasons. First and foremost, small businesses are a vital addition to the economy. By supporting small businesses, you are ensuring that creatives and professionals who choose to go the route of small business self-employment are able to continue offering their products and services to the world and support themselves and their communities by doing so. In a market dominated by mass produced, soulless, disposable products, handmade, carefully and lovingly produced items supplied by independent companies, artists and designers are a valuable and desirable addition to the marketplace, both online and on the high street.</div>
<div>This is our first foray into the world of crowd funding and we are excited to see how it turns out. Your support is greatly appreciated and we are keen to make a start on our project and begin delivering the products that we are working on and that people are asking us for. As a husband and wife team that relies on our business to support ourselves and our ever growing animal family, we are immeasurably grateful to those who choose to patronise our business and cannot express how much every purchase, custom order and commission means to us.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>We know that a campaign such as this is not without its risks and we are also extremely aware that we are only two people, doing everything that we can to deliver our products and our promises in a timely and professional manner.</div>
<div>We foresee a lot of work ahead of us with this campaign, not least in delivering the perks that we have put together for our contributors. We have tried to be as realistic as possible with our estimated delivery times for the perks that we will be sending out, be it physically or via email, but we would like to take this opportunity to say that occasionally there are unforeseen delays. As such a small business, we rely on other, larger companies for small batches of supplies that we buy in in order to make our items. Occasionally we are at their mercy if they are out of what we need etc. Though this is seldom an issue, it has happened and it has a knock-on effect through us, to our customers. For the sake of transparency and honesty, we wish to make it known that though we have an extremely good track record (we maintain a 5-star rating on our chosen selling platform), we are only two people working non-stop to deliver our goods and occasionally there are small delays. We pride ourselves on our fast communication and our openness so we encourage you to message us if you have any questions or concerns at any point along the way.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help! If you wish to help us out but cannot afford to make a contribution to our campaign, please consider the following:</p> <ul> <li>Get the word out to your friends! Tell people about our campaign! Use the hashtag #houseofildjewels to talk about what we're trying to do. Facebook, twitter, tumblr, instagram... it's all good and it all helps.</li> <li>Don't forget about the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p>Thank you SO much for reading.

There were fewer than four turkeys to go around and we ran out of food in less than an hour.

<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
<p>The Ugandan Women Entrepreneurs Association Limited (UWEAL) has
spent 25 years supporting women entrepreneurs, and women leaders for a better
Uganda. <b>Our mission is to empower women entrepreneurs to create wealth through capacity building, networking and advocacy. Our vision is to envisage a wealthy woman responsibly contributing to national economic development. </b></p>
<p>UWEAL offers training, mentorship and business counseling services.
We also organize various networking events such as business exchange visits,
exhibitions, seminars, business forums and conferences locally, regionally and
internationally to facilitate knowledge and experience sharing in addition to
advocating for a favorable environment for women to do business.</p>
<p>In Uganda, agriculture is the biggest sector of the
economy, and women farmers play an
important part in it.  To excel in their
essential role of food production and grow their livelihoods, they need support
and training. Working with these businesswomen farmers, we have identified
several of their needs:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Access to training on
national regulations to access farming resources; </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Training done in their local
languages and in English;</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Training on broader
business topics such as gender and cultural norms, and leadership; </span></li></ul></span></h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>

a woman"". </b>
</h2>
<p>Most of
the food in Uganda is produced by women, but women rarely have the opportunity
or the necessary resources to turn their skill into a profitable business. While
women support their households and their communities through agriculture, this
important contribution has not been recognized at the national level. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">OUR PROJECT</b><br/></p>
<p>As
part of its activities, UWEAL has been carrying out a <b>Leadership</b>, <b>Entrepreneurship
and Development</b> (LED) training program across the country targeting
women in agriculture for the past one year. Participants in the program
receive training and coaching in business, collective marketing and
leadership development. During this 3-day training, Ugandan women farmers
learn how:  </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To transition
from subsistence farming to commercial farming; </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To
fully access and utilize government agricultural resources and services; </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To form
farming groups for collective marketing and increased productivity. </span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We
have so far successfully trained <b>140 women in 7 districts</b>. The
partnership which facilitated these trainings is coming to an end with the
funding it came with. However, we have received tremendous feedback from farmer
participants after the trainings. <b>They appreciated UWEAL’s ability to translate
news and regulations on agriculture in a more accessible manner, thanks to  local trainers who are both experienced and
able to speak the local languages. They also reported increased knowledge in
farming practices and they felt more confident as professional farmers. Finally,
women farmers took advantage of the training to build relationships and plant
the seeds for future cooperatives. </b></p>
<p>There
are 111 districts in Uganda and our goal is to organize trainings in all of
them. We need additional funds to reach more women in agriculture, build their
capacity, and continue our initiative. We already see how these women are improving their leadership skills and are
able to stand for their economic rights.</p>

<h2><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></h2>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>We are asking for $27,000 to fund this project</b>. </span>After running the program for a year, we have
estimated that it costs $4500 to train 25 women farmers in one district. Our plan, for 2015, is
to reach 6 new districts; </p>
<p>The budget is allocated as follow: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Trainers fee: <b>$1,600</b></span><br/>

</li>
</ul>
<p>As we hold these trainings, we are also engaged in continuous advocacy efforts to bring light to the conditions of women farmers in Uganda, working with other non-profit partners and government agencies. We are looking to influence legislation to bring more equal support to women farmers.</p>
<h2></h2>
</div><h2><b>The IMPACT</b></h2>
<p>The participation in the training has shown great
results so far; women farmers have had the opportunity:</p>
<ul>
<li>To refresh their farming knowledge</li>
<li>To learn new and innovative farming
     practices;</li>
<li>To meet other women farmers and share
     their experiences;</li>
<li>To improve their leadership skills as
     entrepreneurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We
see our training as a way to create real and durable change in Uganda. Women
becoming empowered have a direct impact on several levels. </p>
<p>On an
economic level, <b>more women farmers entering in commercial agribusiness will
increase food production, and by the same opportunity, food security for the
country.  </b></p>
<p>In
Uganda, women are in charge of taking care of the family, and it is estimated
that on average each family counts 7
members. In most cases, their
subsistence depends solely on the success of the woman farmer. We
therefore see these dependents as
directly and positively impacted by these changes. <b>The associated
financial security for rural women leads to notable improvements in the well
being of their families regarding their children’s health and education.</b></p>
<p>On an
individual level, gaining access through training to innovative approaches and
awareness of state regulations, and the resulting increase of their production
and therefore business power, reinforces the women farmers’ standing in their communities.
Financial autonomy plays an important role for women’s decision making
abilities. Already acting as family support, they also now have a safe space to
exercise their leadership qualities. <b>Women who participate in our training
recommend it to other women farmers and start organizing in farming groups to
better address common issues in their industry. </b></p>
<p><b>We

</div><p><br/></p></div>","WHO WE ARE
The Ugandan Women Entrepreneurs Association Limited (UWEAL) has
spent 25 years supporting women entrepreneurs, and women leaders for a better
Uganda. Our mission is to empower women entrepreneurs to create wealth through capacity building, networking and advocacy. Our vision is to envisage a wealthy woman responsibly contributing to national economic development. 
UWEAL offers training, mentorship and business counseling services.
We also organize various networking events such as business exchange visits,
exhibitions, seminars, business forums and conferences locally, regionally and
internationally to facilitate knowledge and experience sharing in addition to
advocating for a favorable environment for women to do business.
In Uganda, agriculture is the biggest sector of the
economy, and women farmers play an
important part in it.  To excel in their
essential role of food production and grow their livelihoods, they need support
and training. Working with these businesswomen farmers, we have identified
several of their needs:


Access to training on
national regulations to access farming resources; 
Training done in their local
languages and in English;
Training on broader
business topics such as gender and cultural norms, and leadership; 



 ""8 times out of 10, the farmer feeding the nation is
a woman"". 

Most of
the food in Uganda is produced by women, but women rarely have the opportunity
or the necessary resources to turn their skill into a profitable business. While
women support their households and their communities through agriculture, this
important contribution has not been recognized at the national level. 
OUR PROJECT
As
part of its activities, UWEAL has been carrying out a Leadership, Entrepreneurship
and Development (LED) training program across the country targeting
women in agriculture for the past one year. Participants in the program
receive training and coaching in business, collective marketing and
leadership development. During this 3-day training, Ugandan women farmers
learn how:  



To transition
from subsistence farming to commercial farming; 


To
fully access and utilize government agricultural resources and services; 


To form
farming groups for collective marketing and increased productivity. 


We
have so far successfully trained 140 women in 7 districts. The
partnership which facilitated these trainings is coming to an end with the
funding it came with. However, we have received tremendous feedback from farmer
participants after the trainings. They appreciated UWEAL’s ability to translate
news and regulations on agriculture in a more accessible manner, thanks to  local trainers who are both experienced and
able to speak the local languages. They also reported increased knowledge in
farming practices and they felt more confident as professional farmers. Finally,
women farmers took advantage of the training to build relationships and plant
the seeds for future cooperatives. 
There
are 111 districts in Uganda and our goal is to organize trainings in all of
them. We need additional funds to reach more women in agriculture, build their
capacity, and continue our initiative. We already see how these women are improving their leadership skills and are
able to stand for their economic rights.


WHAT WE NEED
We are asking for $27,000 to fund this project. After running the program for a year, we have
estimated that it costs $4500 to train 25 women farmers in one district. Our plan, for 2015, is
to reach 6 new districts; 
The budget is allocated as follow: 



Trainers fee: $1,600


Venue hire for 3 days (includes room, meals for staff, trainers and women farmers) : $1600


Transportation for whole training team and staff: $700


Training material for 25  women: $600


As we hold these trainings, we are also engaged in continuous advocacy efforts to bring light to the conditions of women farmers in Uganda, working with other non-profit partners and government agencies. We are looking to influence legislation to bring more equal support to women farmers.

The IMPACT
The participation in the training has shown great
results so far; women farmers have had the opportunity:

To refresh their farming knowledge
To learn new and innovative farming
     practices;
To meet other women farmers and share
     their experiences;
To improve their leadership skills as
     entrepreneurs.

We
see our training as a way to create real and durable change in Uganda. Women
becoming empowered have a direct impact on several levels. 
On an
economic level, more women farmers entering in commercial agribusiness will
increase food production, and by the same opportunity, food security for the
country.  
In
Uganda, women are in charge of taking care of the family, and it is estimated
that on average each family counts 7
members. In most cases, their
subsistence depends solely on the success of the woman farmer. We
therefore see these dependents as
directly and positively impacted by these changes. The associated
financial security for rural women leads to notable improvements in the well
being of their families regarding their children’s health and education.
On an
individual level, gaining access through training to innovative approaches and
awareness of state regulations, and the resulting increase of their production
and therefore business power, reinforces the women farmers’ standing in their communities.
Financial autonomy plays an important role for women’s decision making
abilities. Already acting as family support, they also now have a safe space to
exercise their leadership qualities. Women who participate in our training
recommend it to other women farmers and start organizing in farming groups to
better address common issues in their industry. 
We
believe our training is an essential public service allowing women farmers to
access public resources, to play their part in the economy of their country,
and become full citizens. 


Risks
& Challenges
Several
risks exist inherent to the management of nonprofit organizations. 
Staff
turnover could cause some delays in the roll out of the training. We however
have board members who are deeply committed to our mission,  are women
farmers but also advocates working with the government to change policy at the country level. They are a sure resource for our participants to receive accurate
information and professional counseling regarding farming practices, business
creation and management and advocacy related questions. 
As of

and continue such a promising initiative. We see this risk being suffered by
the women farmers who will be left with very few opportunities to receive the
individual support they get through our intervention. As we mentioned

</div><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Thank you for checking out our campaign! I guess we should introduce ourselves and our idea:</p><ul>
<li>Helder Hills is the name that myself (Casey) and my partner (Justin) have come up with for the name of our soon-to-be alpaca farm. I grew up on a beef farm in rural Ontario and have an Agricultural High Skills Major on my side, so I know my way around a farm. Justin has several summers worth of experience working hard on his grandfathers dairy farm so he's been able to get his hands plenty dirty in the agricultural world, too! We both love the farming life but knew cash-cropping just wasn't for us, for starters we didn't want to grow corn. We like things a little more off-centre than that!</li>
<li>We did our own research and one day Justin asked if I wanted to raise alpacas. That was the turn-around point. I'm a crafter by nature (I taught myself how to crochet) and I knew how wonderful alpaca fiber is. Softer than wool, warmer too; it's so great to work with! We wanted to be able to bring this quality to others, either by making yarns for other crafters or finished products like scarves and duvets to those who don't know how to make their own.</li>
<li>Here's where you come in! Justin and I currently do not own a farm but we have an agreement set up to rent an existing alpaca farm. Everything infrastructure-wise is already in place, all we need is the alpacas and supplies. Every dollar earned will go towards purchasing supplies (including food, emergency cria [baby alpaca] kits, vet bills, harnesses, shears, etc.) and the alpacas themselves. We're looking to start off with a modest 30 alpacas; 25 females and 5 males. This will give us plenty of breeding room (we can't have crossing bloodlines!) while starting us off at a decent pace.</li>
<li>With your donations we will be able to start this company before the spring shearing to provide our products in the first year of business!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are asking for $50,000 to get this farm up and running. Here's the breakdown:</p><ul>
<li>$18,000 for one year of property rental</li>
<li>$24,000 for the starting herd (estimating $800 per alpaca X30 alpacas)</li>
<li>$4,500 for livestock insurance (approx. $300 for our top 15 alpacas)</li>
<li>$2,000 for supplies (includes first-year vet fees, nail trimmers, shears, emergency kits, fence repairs, etc.)</li>
<li>$500 for business operations</li>
<li>$500 for feed (pellets all year, hay only when pasture is unavailable)</li>
<li>$500 for marketing</li>
</ul><div>Now this is all fine and dandy, but you're probably wondering ""what's in it for me?"". Well we decided to make 6 grades of perks, seeing as there are 6 grades of alpaca fiber. All alpaca products are made by our mentors at Alpaca Central and the Grand Valley Fiber Company:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Grade 1: For $15 you will receive photographs of our starter herd (photos by Justin).</li>
<li>Grade 2: For $50 you will receive a pair of alpaca-local wool blend insoles.</li>
<li>Grade 3: For $100 you will receive a Bear Buddy kit (essentially a build-your-own teddy; includes bear-shaped felt cutouts, stuffing, and yarn all made with alpaca fiber).</li>
<li>Grade 4: For $150 you will receive a skein of alpaca-merino blend yarn (sock weight).</li>
<li>Grade 5: For $500 you will receive an afghan made by myself.</li>
<li>Grade 6: For $1000 you will receive an invitation to our very first spring shearing. Don't worry, we won't put you to work! Learn how to shear alpacas through the attempts made by Justin and I, meet the herd, and learn as much about alpacas as you can!</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we not reach our total end goal we will focus on purchasing the supplies required. If we earn more than what will purchase our starter supplies we will look into boarding a herd at another farm instead of renting our own to reduce our property costs. We hope to earn enough to start off with 30 alpacas, but we will start off with less and add to our herd along the way if necessary.</p>
</div><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>As we have found with the alpaca business there is really only one great risk factor: loss of an alpaca. Fortunately, these animals have very few health risks; however, we intend to insure 15 of the top animals in the initial herd until the point in which our herd has grown significantly and we become profitable so as we can afford the risk and have developed our skills to the point where we feel comfortable without the insurance.</p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We know times are tight and we don't expect anyone to give us everything they have. If you can't donate but still would love to see a large-scale, complete-cycle alpaca farm become a reality please share our campaign with your friends and family! </p><p>We're on Facebook!

<p>We are in the business of renting
49cc motor scooters, mostly to vacationers, to enhance their holiday
experience.  In markets where our rental
center is in a pedestrian area, we will also rent mobility scooters so seniors and
the disabled can enjoy their vacation experience as well.  Surprisingly, the economics (cost, etc.) of
mobility scooters is very similar those of motor scooters.  </p>
<p>We also sell new and our slightly used
scooters (discussed later).  And we rent
helmets in cities where the law deems them optional equipment (in cities where
they’re required, we include them), and we sell souvenir hats, t-shirts,
sunglasses, suntan oil and other accessories.</p>
<p>In most states and Caribbean
countries, only a regular driver’s license (no motorcycle endorsement) is
required to operate 49cc scooters.  They
are rated to operate between 30 and 40 miles per hour depending on the altitude
of the city and other factors.</p>
<p>Although there are lots of motor
scooter rental outlets throughout the country and the Caribbean, no company
owns more than a few outlets.  This is an
industry in its infancy!  Scoot Over
America will be the only national chain, allowing renters to get on line and reserve
the city and scooter they want to rent, or call a toll free number and speak to
a reservations agent.</p>
<p><b><u>What will you do with the money?</u></b></p>
<p>Most of the money we raise will be
used to massively increase our fleet of motor scooters.  We will be recruiting “independent agents”
(just like U-haul, one of the business models we are seeking to emulate) in
vacation spots throughout the country and the Caribbean.  These scooters will become our agents’ stock
and trade.  We will also be acquiring
computer tablets to accommodate our “Scooty Rental Program” (our proprietary
point-of-purchase rental software), computer printers for contract preparation,
flat screen TVs for providing scooter operation and safety procedures to
renters.</p>
<p><b><u>The Caribbean?</u></b></p>
<p>Millions
of cruise passengers are transported to various Caribbean ports annually. The cruise lines aggressively sell excursions
in each of these ports, yet none currently offers “scooter tours”.  This is because the industry is very
splintered.  It would be difficult for
the cruise lines to deal with dozens of different independent operators.  We believe that by working with and offering
sales commissions to these cruise lines, they will begin pre-selling guided,
narrated scooter tours in each of these destinations, which will be managed and
operated by our local Caribbean agents.  </p>
<p><b><u>What are you doing to improve our global environment?</u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/796443/files/20140818154257-Water-Pollution-Facts.jpg?1408401777"" src="""" style=""width: 359.576px; height: 301px;""/></p><p>We are
significantly reducing the carbon footprint left by visitors in cities in which
we operate by substituting the use of tour buses, automobiles, etc, with highly
efficient motor scooters (100+ miles per gallon) and electric mobility
scooters.  In cities particularly
troubled by pollution (E.g. New York, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, Houston, etc.) we
will provide our agents ELECTRIC motor scooters, eliminating even the smallest
carbon footprint.</p>
<p><b><u>Isn’t scooter renting a seasonal business?</u></b></p>
<p>In most states the scooter rental
season is six months long, mid-April through mid-October.  However, at JUST these times, vacation hot
spots in California, Florida and the Caribbean go into their busy season.  Aided by our computer program, each fall, we
will simply relocate our scooters from cold climates to those cities which
enjoy heavy winter tourism.</p>
<p><b><u>Exactly how big are you now, and how big do you plan to get?</u></b></p>
<p>We have been in business for three
years.  We became profitable the first
week.  The economics of our business are
impressive:  While it typically takes a
car rental company 150 rental days to recoup their cost of the rental vehicle,
we can recover our cost of a scooter within a week!</p>
<p>During our first season, we
operated a 10 motor scooter fleet in the captivating mountain town of Ruidoso,
New Mexico.  Within the first twelve
months we expanded our fleet four-fold to 40 scooters, operating in three
locations (we added Albuquerque, NM and Santa Fe, NM).  During this time we perfected our business
model, creating the “Scooty Rental Program” a point-of-purchase computer
program that allows us to monitor and audit rental transactions in an unlimited
number of remote locations.  </p>
<p>  We deem
36 states “friendly” to motor scooters (allowing vacationers to rent without a
motorcycle endorsement on their driver’s license).  Each of these states has anywhere from one to

We are in the business of renting
49cc motor scooters, mostly to vacationers, to enhance their holiday
experience.  In markets where our rental
center is in a pedestrian area, we will also rent mobility scooters so seniors and
the disabled can enjoy their vacation experience as well.  Surprisingly, the economics (cost, etc.) of
mobility scooters is very similar those of motor scooters.  
We also sell new and our slightly used
scooters (discussed later).  And we rent
helmets in cities where the law deems them optional equipment (in cities where
they’re required, we include them), and we sell souvenir hats, t-shirts,
sunglasses, suntan oil and other accessories.
In most states and Caribbean
countries, only a regular driver’s license (no motorcycle endorsement) is
required to operate 49cc scooters.  They
are rated to operate between 30 and 40 miles per hour depending on the altitude
of the city and other factors.
Although there are lots of motor
scooter rental outlets throughout the country and the Caribbean, no company
owns more than a few outlets.  This is an
industry in its infancy!  Scoot Over
America will be the only national chain, allowing renters to get on line and reserve
the city and scooter they want to rent, or call a toll free number and speak to
a reservations agent.
What will you do with the money?
Most of the money we raise will be
used to massively increase our fleet of motor scooters.  We will be recruiting “independent agents”
(just like U-haul, one of the business models we are seeking to emulate) in
vacation spots throughout the country and the Caribbean.  These scooters will become our agents’ stock
and trade.  We will also be acquiring
computer tablets to accommodate our “Scooty Rental Program” (our proprietary
point-of-purchase rental software), computer printers for contract preparation,
flat screen TVs for providing scooter operation and safety procedures to
renters.
The Caribbean?
Millions
of cruise passengers are transported to various Caribbean ports annually. The cruise lines aggressively sell excursions
in each of these ports, yet none currently offers “scooter tours”.  This is because the industry is very
splintered.  It would be difficult for
the cruise lines to deal with dozens of different independent operators.  We believe that by working with and offering
sales commissions to these cruise lines, they will begin pre-selling guided,
narrated scooter tours in each of these destinations, which will be managed and
operated by our local Caribbean agents.  
What are you doing to improve our global environment?
 We are
significantly reducing the carbon footprint left by visitors in cities in which
we operate by substituting the use of tour buses, automobiles, etc, with highly
efficient motor scooters (100+ miles per gallon) and electric mobility
scooters.  In cities particularly
troubled by pollution (E.g. New York, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, Houston, etc.) we
will provide our agents ELECTRIC motor scooters, eliminating even the smallest
carbon footprint.
Isn’t scooter renting a seasonal business?
In most states the scooter rental
season is six months long, mid-April through mid-October.  However, at JUST these times, vacation hot
spots in California, Florida and the Caribbean go into their busy season.  Aided by our computer program, each fall, we
will simply relocate our scooters from cold climates to those cities which
enjoy heavy winter tourism.
Exactly how big are you now, and how big do you plan to get?
We have been in business for three
years.  We became profitable the first
week.  The economics of our business are
impressive:  While it typically takes a
car rental company 150 rental days to recoup their cost of the rental vehicle,
we can recover our cost of a scooter within a week!
During our first season, we
operated a 10 motor scooter fleet in the captivating mountain town of Ruidoso,
New Mexico.  Within the first twelve
months we expanded our fleet four-fold to 40 scooters, operating in three
locations (we added Albuquerque, NM and Santa Fe, NM).  During this time we perfected our business
model, creating the “Scooty Rental Program” a point-of-purchase computer
program that allows us to monitor and audit rental transactions in an unlimited
number of remote locations.  
  We deem
36 states “friendly” to motor scooters (allowing vacationers to rent without a
motorcycle endorsement on their driver’s license).  Each of these states has anywhere from one to
a few dozen tourist locales, providing us over 150 target markets
nationwide.  Additionally, there are over
30 popular Caribbean cruise ports for the conquering!Are you “giving back” to our community?Since our inception, we have had a particular soft spot for the brave men and women who defend our country, offering them generous military discounts when they rent motor scooters or, in the case of injured veterans, mobility scooters.  We proactively seek out veterans for employment, have discounts for veterans to open their own Scooter Over America location, and even our General Manager is a veteran who was deployed to Iraq for 12 months.  In preparation for our national expansion, we have committed to donating a portion of our proceeds to the Wounded Warrior Project.

I realized it wasn't his fault.  Even though we didn't grow up in the same house, I personally knew it was hard to balance all of those decisions.  </p><p>I grew up with my grandmother who was retired, diabetic, had heart disease, and cancer.  As a result, I often ate fast food for sustenance.  When I left home at 17, it was hard to budget and plan my meals, and yes, I had no concept of what was proper nutrition.  </p><p><b><i>This life experience motivated me to begin Stretch Recipes to solve 5 key challenges:</i></b></p><p>1)  I have only 'X' dollars and I need them to last 'Y' days before I get my next paycheck.</p><p>2)  I want to eat something other than ramen, junk food, and/or the same 5 things my mother cooked for me.  </p><p>3)  I always forget the coupons, or I'm an extreme couponer and if my mobile device would take care of it, I'd be in heaven.  </p><p>4)  I'm trying to save for (insert) goal and the only place I can cut is my food and budget.  </p><p>5)  I've recently had to change my diet.  My funds are limited and it's just a lot of stress trying to plan everything out.  </p><p><b>HOW WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP?</b></p><p>We're raising funds to help us to reach our next milestone, the MVP (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Minimum Viable Product</a>).  This MVP will enable us to test our product with a group of 100 people to fine tune for a great experience and make sure it's amazing when we go to launch the Beta.  These funds will cover:</p><ul>

Her hobbies include top golf, dancing, and traveling.<br/></p><p>It was recognizing the cyclical budget and nutrition patterns within her own life that led her to found Stretch Recipes, Inc.   She created Stret¢h because she wanted to make a tool that actually helps people with tight budgets maximize their dollar and have access to more nutritional recipes. She herself grew up in a low income household without the tools to learn how to budget for groceries, nor to prepare healthy meals.</p><p>In August/September of 2013, the answer to providing help came in the thought to build an actual tool.  Already working in mobile apps, it seemed the best form to create a self-governed solution.  In November 2013, she began looking more into the problem and seeking help to pull it off.  In March 2013, she began landing partnerships with the SNAP program and local food banks in an effort to ensure the application would work for the tightest of budgets.  In early April, Lauren resigned from her full-time job in Real Estate Sales at Meritage Homes to found and build Stretch Recipes full-time.  Later that month, she also met CTO Ben Shank who would eventually become her Technical Co-Founder equally obsessed with creating a solution to help everyone eat better and save more.</p><p><br/></p><p>Ben Shank began programming when his third grade teacher cut a deal with him: pay attention in class and receive computer mentoring after school.

For every $1,000 contributed, we will host a 1-on-1 Stret¢h cooking class for a family or individual in need.WHY DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS APP, LAUREN?Because Cheetos, Potato Chips, and Ground Beef changed my life.  A few years ago, when I was in graduate school, my youngest brother came to live with me.  I couldn't afford to feed him.  As a result, he had to sign up for food stamps.  In his first trip to the grocery store, he exhausted his entire month's budget.  After I finished yelling at him and cursing the system for being foolish enough to give him a full months funding in one shot... I realized it wasn't his fault.  Even though we didn't grow up in the same house, I personally knew it was hard to balance all of those decisions.  I grew up with my grandmother who was retired, diabetic, had heart disease, and cancer.  As a result, I often ate fast food for sustenance.  When I left home at 17, it was hard to budget and plan my meals, and yes, I had no concept of what was proper nutrition.  This life experience motivated me to begin Stretch Recipes to solve 5 key challenges:1)  I have only 'X' dollars and I need them to last 'Y' days before I get my next paycheck.2)  I want to eat something other than ramen, junk food, and/or the same 5 things my mother cooked for me.  3)  I always forget the coupons, or I'm an extreme couponer and if my mobile device would take care of it, I'd be in heaven.  4)  I'm trying to save for (insert) goal and the only place I can cut is my food and budget.  5)  I've recently had to change my diet.  My funds are limited and it's just a lot of stress trying to plan everything out.  HOW WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP?We're raising funds to help us to reach our next milestone, the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).  This MVP will enable us to test our product with a group of 100 people to fine tune for a great experience and make sure it's amazing when we go to launch the Beta.  These funds will cover:

Front-end design (UX and UI):  Easy to use and intuitive.  No clutter, no questions on how to use, and no numerous questions asked to get it to work.  We want only the best experience for our users.  

Hosting Costs:  We have a database and algorithms designed to help you maximize the experience.  We need hosting to ensure delivery and no down times.

Content Creation:  Pictures of food make it more fun to browse recipes.  We also need groceries and photographers.  Licensing fees quickly add up. 

Marketing and Research:  Truthfully, by contributing to this campaign, you effectively tell us the most important answers - Is what I am doing really needed?
Now, are you ready to Stret¢h your dollar to eat better and save more? RISKS AND CHALLENGESMy co-founder and I work full-time on this project – living off our small savings to bring our idea to life.  We believe in this that much.  We have designed your contribution levels to ensure that we can achieve the goals we have outlined above on time.We've estimated dates for delivery based on our current timeline for getting the product completed and launched and have aligned these to the target contribution levels.With your support and our commitment we plan to have the MVP completed by September 2014.We promise to  always keep you updated on our progress.Our TeamLauren Foster is the Founder, CEO/President of Stretch Recipes, Inc. an Austin based start-up.  A proud Chicago native and first generation college student and MBA, she is an Entrepreneur with over 15 years sum total experience in Media, Telecommunications, and Real Estate. Her hobbies include top golf, dancing, and traveling.It was recognizing the cyclical budget and nutrition patterns within her own life that led her to found Stretch Recipes, Inc.   She created Stret¢h because she wanted to make a tool that actually helps people with tight budgets maximize their dollar and have access to more nutritional recipes. She herself grew up in a low income household without the tools to learn how to budget for groceries, nor to prepare healthy meals.In August/September of 2013, the answer to providing help came in the thought to build an actual tool.  Already working in mobile apps, it seemed the best form to create a self-governed solution.  In November 2013, she began looking more into the problem and seeking help to pull it off.  In March 2013, she began landing partnerships with the SNAP program and local food banks in an effort to ensure the application would work for the tightest of budgets.  In early April, Lauren resigned from her full-time job in Real Estate Sales at Meritage Homes to found and build Stretch Recipes full-time.  Later that month, she also met CTO Ben Shank who would eventually become her Technical Co-Founder equally obsessed with creating a solution to help everyone eat better and save more.Ben Shank began programming when his third grade teacher cut a deal with him: pay attention in class and receive computer mentoring after school. He was later mentored by his little league baseball coach, the 23rd employee of Sun Microsystems, and further taught by a lead engineer of Microsoft's TerraServer (now MSR Maps) who also introduced him to Miles Davis.Ben went on to win a $250,000 sole-source software development contract with the State of Washington, integrate the computer vision subsystem leading to the first successful flight test and continuation of funding for ARGUS-IS, and lead development of AOL's internal content aggregation platform, spanning over 500 media properties including TechCrunch and Huffington Post.He is working to complete his MS in applied mathematics through Columbia University in 2015, and completed his GSD in the mid 1980's. Ben is an avid motorcyclist, a fun uncle, enjoys playing jazz and progressive rock guitar, and has read one Philip Roth novel.Acting on a deep-seated need to effect positive change in people's lives, Ben aligned immediately with Lauren's mission to maximize the choice of nutritional eating options to those with limited financial resources and left AOL to help realize her vision.FAQ'SWe've done our best to anticipate questions you may have.  Please feel free to message us through Indiegogo and we will be more than happy to reply and update the FAQ's.  Will this work for me if I am on Food Stamps?  Absolutely!  We are always working with partners to serve you.  When we say help everyone eat better and save more, we mean EVERYONE.  We have partners in Austin such as the Sustainable Food Center (SFC) and are always looking forward to growing more partnerships in markets that have similar programs.  What we love about SFC is that they offer Double-Dollar incentives at Farmers Markets for Seasonal Fresh Produce for SNAP and WIC recipients.  This means, your SNAP or WIC dollars go twice as far.  How are servings calculated?   We base servings on recommendations based on the recipe.  However, that's what this MVP is for, to test to ensure that the servings are not only appropriate, but don't leave you feeling shorted at meal times.Will you have Gluten-free Recipes?  YesWill you have Paleo Recipes?

</div><p><b>Adoption Fundraising Campaign Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello! Thank you for visiting our
adoption fundraising campaign! We are “The Reverends Pendergrass” because both
of us are, well, reverends! We both serve churches as pastors. Put simply, we
want to open up our home and family to an infant. We cannot have children of
our own and we know that there are many courageous parents out there who are
choosing to place their newborns into the adoption process. We trust that God
will connect us with a child whose needs for love and care can be met in our
household. Down to the details: adoption can be expensive ($20,000-$40,000 for
a domestic adoption), and we want to offer you a chance to help us prepare to
welcome an infant to our home! Your gifts go straight into our “adoption fund”
which will go directly to adoption process expenses. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $5,000 (just
a small part of the estimated total cost of adoption). Like we said above, all
money raised will go straight into our “adoption fund” (a savings account) to
be used ONLY for expenses directly related to adoption such as the home study,
agency fees, legal fees, finalizing expenses, etc. If we don’t reach our goal,
that’s where the funds will still be going (Indiegogo just gets a bigger
percentage of whatever funds we do raise). </p>
<p><br/>
What do you get? Check out the perks! You will get a personalized thank you
(electronic or handwritten depending on your giving), a photograph of the
actual newborn once we adopt a child, a framed photo, a painted handprint, a
video of the baby, or even a photo book of the baby!</p>
<p>Keep in mind, anything having to do
with the baby (like the photos, video, or handprint) won’t get to you until
AFTER we adopt a child! That could be as long as a couple years from now. We
will, of course, keep ALL of our supporters updated on our adoption process so
you won’t feel like we’ve forgotten about you. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Why
should you give? There are so many children in the world that need parents and
families who will love them and are capable of supporting them. Recognize that
many children who are put up for adoption are born to parents who deeply care
for their child’s wellbeing. They love their child so much that they would
rather see another family raise them. That’s downright amazing! Yes, your gifts
help <i>us </i>to adopt a child, but your
gifts give a child a home and family forever! </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Before we can adopt, we have some
things to do first. We have to have a home study done where a social worker
comes to our home, interviews us, examines our financial records, does deep
background checks on us, and interviews our families, friends, neighbors,
coworkers, and others. Then, we begin applying to adoption agencies and
networkers. Different agencies have different needs based on the children and
families coming to them. Some agencies may not need or want us. It is a matter
of being connected to the right agency at the right time. That will require
prayer, patience, and perseverance. The biggest challenge to us: time. It can
take one to two years <i>after </i>applying
before being matched with an expectant mother looking for someone to adopt her
child. Just know that when you donate to this campaign, your money will only be
used for the adoption process, no matter how long it may take. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>MOST IMPORTANTLY: Share this
campaign with your friends and family!!! The more the word gets out, the better
our chances of reaching our goal! </p>
<p>What if you can’t (or don’t) want to
contribute money to the adoption campaign? There’s plenty you can do, still!
First, pray for us. Remember us in your regular prayers. Pray that we will be
connected with the child (or children) that God might intends to bring into our
family. Pray for us as we go through this process. It is emotional, it is slow,
it is full of uncertainty. We will need encouragement from time to time. We
will need to learn how to be parents in the meantime. We will need to continue
to prepare our home to receive an infant. No matter how you help with our
campaign, through gifts or prayers or encouraging words, thank you! We
appreciate you and whatever you bring! It truly takes a village to raise a
child. Our village just tends to be a little larger and a little more spread
out these days, doesn’t it?</p>

<h3>Dear Friends and Family, </h3>

<p>As you may or may not know, I am a chapter president in an amazing organization called I AM THAT GIRL. I AM THAT GIRL is a community, and a movement inspiring girls to LOVE, EXPRESS, and BE who they are. This organization has been, and continues to be, a source of inspiration and encouragement in my daily life.</p>
<p>I decided to start the IATG chapter here at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) because I felt a community where girls could come together and just BE, was lacking. We as females can be so competitive with one another that we forget to just stop and tell each other how great we are. We forget that although we may be different in numerous ways, if we only come together and TALK, we could break barriers! The IATG chapter at VCU has been a huge blessing to me. I've learned so much about myself in the short year that we have been an established group on campus and it continues to make me grow as a woman everyday.</p>
<p>The IATG chapter at VCU has bi-weekly meetings where we discuss issues that really matter to young women like ourselves - topics vary every meeting and each is full of laughter, love, and FOOD! Also, as a chapter we conduct confidence building workshops with young girls in the surrounding Richmond community that not only helps them, but is also a blessing to us. We are currently in the process of planning a Heels 2 Heal mini-marathon for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, where women, men, and children will come together and run a short distance in heels to symbolize the ability of overcoming something terrible, TOGETHER.</p>
<p>I AM THAT GIRL is hosting it's first leadership retreat this October in Los Angeles, California and has chosen 15 chapter leaders out of 100 chapters around the world. I am HONORED to be one of the 15 chosen for this once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
<p>This retreat will provide us with leadership training and connections to other local chapters around the world - helping us to strengthen our own community and the IATG community as a whole. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In order for to attend the leadership retreat I need to raise $1,000. The money will go directly to the organization to continue the powerful programming they provide. EVERY dollar counts and is greatly appreciated!</span></p>
<p>Also, I AM THAT GIRL is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization - and that means your donation is tax-deductible! So I ask you, to please take a moment and donate to help me gain the tools to help others! </p>

<h3>OmniBazaar -- Removing Middlemen and Bankers from E-commerce</h3>
<p>OmniBazaar is a new type of e-commerce marketplace that <b>removes the middlemen and bankers from e-commerce</b>. OmniBazaar will allow users to buy and sell <b>directly among themselves</b> (rather than through a middleman site like Amazon or eBay), <b>using Bitcoin and OmniCoin</b> (instead of credit cards or PayPal). By using a distributed structure to eliminate the middlemen, and using Bitcoin and OmniCoin to eliminate the bankers, OmniBazaar will be able to charge users about <b>80% lower fees</b> than existing e-commerce sites like eBay and Amazon. </p>
<p>OmniBazaar will also serve the 2.5 billion ""un-banked"" people world-wide who cannot use existing e-commerce sites, because those sites require users to have credit cards and bank accounts. </p>
<p>Participants anywhere in the world will be able to buy and sell in the OmniBazaar marketplace <b>without bank accounts, credit cards, application forms, or credit checks</b>, using only their <span style=""background-color: initial;"">computer</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">smartphone, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">or tablet.</span></p>
<p>Individuals and small businesses will transact business among themselves using a free version of the OmniBazaar software to list and shop for products and services. Users will pay <b>no fees to join</b> the marketplace, <b>no fees to shop or post listings</b>, and <b>no monthly or annual membership fees</b>. Users will pay only a small (~1%) fee on each transaction to support service providers in the marketplace network.</p>
<p>The marketplace technology to accomplish this has been designed, programmed, and a <b>working prototype</b> created. Funding we receive in this campaign will enable us to complete the development of OmniCoin and the OmniBazaar marketplace software.</p>

<h3>CryptoBazaar -- Enabling Anonymous E-commerce</h3>
<p>The CryptoBazaar upgrade for the OmniBazaar software will allow you to <b>buy and sell anonymously</b> through the OmniBazaar marketplace, by using advanced software that can ""cloak"" your computer's internet address, and allow you to preserve as much personal privacy as you choose.</p> <p>The CryptoBazaar upgrade will include access to a <b>peer-to-peer escrow service</b>, provided cooperatively by other CryptoBazaar users, that will allow secure transactions between buyers and sellers who don't know or trust each other.</p>
<p>CryptoBazaar will also provide a secure, escrowed,  <b>distributed  cryptocurrency  exchange</b>. Imagine being able to buy and sell  cryptocurrencies  without relying on a centralized exchange.</p>

<h3>New Currency for a New Marketplace</h3>
<p>OmniCoin (XOM) is the digital currency of the OmniBazaar marketplace. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">People will use Bitcoins and OmniCoins to buy and sell goods and services in the OmniBazaar marketplace. The value of OmniCoins will “float” freely compared to other currencies, and the value of OmniCoins will be based on the value of the goods and services they can buy in the marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">OmniCoin is <b>simple and secure</b> to use. It is <b>privacy-friendly</b>, because it allows you to choose to conduct transactions that are either transparent or anonymous. Transaction processing takes seconds instead of minutes, so OmniCoin is <b>business-friendly</b>. Transaction processing uses relatively little computing power, so OmniCoin is <b>eco-friendly</b>. And, with OmniCoin, you can do transactions using an account name instead of a string of numbers. This makes OmniCoin <b>user-friendly.</b></span><br/></p>
<p>Beginning at the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">launch of </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">OmniBazaar and OmniCoin, </span><strong style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">we will start giving away all 20,000,000,000 OmniCoins</strong><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> to users of the OmniBazaar marketplace. Each new user will receive a few thousand OmniCoins when they register, and additional coins when they refer a friend or do transactions in the marketplace.</span></p>
<p>We want tens or hundreds of millions of people to eventually become owners of OmniCoin and users of the OmniBazaar marketplace. So, we will give away<b> billions of coins to millions of people</b> who join, refer their friends, do transactions in the marketplace, and provide the services and infrastructure for the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>In the beginning, OmniCoins will be free.</strong> But, as thousand, millions, or billions of people use them in the OmniBazaar marketplace, OmniCoins will find a value, as any currency does, based on the confidence people have that they can use OmniCoin to purchase valuable goods and services.</p> <h3>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>
<h4>Why create another cryptocurrency? Why not just use Bitcoin?</h4>
<p>There are several reasons. Bitcoin is not particularly anonymous, so we are designing OmniCoin to be <b>more private</b>. An address for receiving Bitcoin looks like this: <b>15r8p9bbciYyjn3Jo1o4UEne7XKAXPCTM3</b>, while an address for receiving OmniCoin looks like this: <b>Alice_B</b>. Bitcoin takes up to an hour to generate six confirmations of validity for a transaction, whereas OmniCoin will generate <b>six confirmations in under a minute. </b>Confirming Bitcoin transactions is very energy-intensive, but confirming OmniCoins is done using <b>a small fraction of the energy</b> and a fraction of the time. OmniCoin is also designed to be better than Bitcoin at accommodating the<b> ""micro-payment"" transactions</b> that will occur when marketplace service providers are paid a small percentage of the transaction fees from a transaction. We're also building OmniCoin with a simple, <b>automated escrow</b> feature that doesn't exist in other Bitcoin wallets, and a <b>reputation tracking feature</b> that doesn't exist anywhere in Bitcoin (that we know of). Finally, by creating a token specifically for the OmniBazaar marketplace we believe we can make the marketplace more useful and robust.</p>
<p>Having said all that, we are building OmniBazaar to operate with <b>both</b> <b>Bitcoin and OmniCoin.<br/><br/></b></p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Wait a minute! Are you saying you plan to dump 20 billion OmniCoins onto the market when OmniBazaar launches?</h4>
<p>No. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>The number of coins in circulation will be completely determined by how many people join and use the OmniBazaar marketplace. We will give only a small (relative to the eventual 20 billion) number of coins to each person who joins OmniBazaar, and an even smaller number of coins for referring a friend. We will distribute half the coins in this manner, over the span of as many months or years as it takes to distribute them all. We will distribute the other 10 billion coins as<b> ""reverse transaction fees"" </b>when users conduct transactions with each other in the marketplace. In other words, during the initial distribution period, we will essentially pay users a small OmniCoin bonus to buy or sell something in the marketplace.</p>
<p>We haven't finalized the numbers yet, but let's say we give 1,000 OmniCoins to each new user who joins OmniBazaar. This represents one twenty-millionth (1/20,000,000) of the total eventual coin supply. That would be a <b><i>much slower</i></b> emission rate than most other coins have. We could give 10,000 coins to each new user and still have a slow emission rate. We think this is infinitely more rational and fair than most other recently introduced cryptocurrencies (especially the ones that generate all the coins in just a few weeks to enrich the developers and their friends). And we believe this distribution plan will <b>add liquidity at the rate that is needed by the marketplace</b>. As more people join, more OmniCoins will come into circulation. Similarly, we estimate that users will do hundreds of millions of transactions in the marketplace before the ""reverse transaction fee"" pool of coins is completely distributed.</p>
<br/><h4>How can OmniCoins have value if you are giving them away?</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">When most cryptocurrencies launch, they make a point of promoting the wonderful new features of the coin itself, with the idea that those features are somehow the basis of its value. We are taking a completely different (and radical) approach. We believe that the value of <b><i>any</i></b> currency lies <b><i>only</i></b> in the confidence people have that it can be <b>used</b>, today or in the near future, to acquire valuable goods and services. People can come to perceive a unit of currency as an investment, if they believe it will be more useful (valuable) in the future. But that is a different concept than its value (usefulness) as a currency today.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">We are giving away 20 billion OmniCoin to emphasize the fact that any cryptocurrency,<i> <b>by itself</b></i>, is absolutely worthless. It is nothing more than some bits and bytes pushed across the Internet. Only the<b><i> usefulness</i></b> of a cryptocurrency gives it any value. So, we are creating a simple, secure, cooperative, distributed marketplace where OmniCoins can easily be used, and allowing OmniCoin to find its own value. If we do a good job of making the marketplace easy, safe, and inexpensive to use, and create OmniCoin with advanced features that make it <b>useful</b> in that marketplace, we feel certain that both OmniBazaar and OmniCoin will prosper. The price of OmniCoins may be low in the beginning. But, the more they become useful (and are used), the higher the value (and price) will become.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Why charge transaction fees for services? If the marketplace is cooperative, why isn't it free?</h4>
<p>Without charges for consumers of services, and incentives for providers of services, the OmniBazaar marketplace would experience a phenomenon known as the <b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""tragedy of the commons""</a></b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a>    The creator of Bitcoin avoided this problem, with respect to transaction processing and network security, by providing a financial incentive for the Bitcoin ""miners"" who provide these services. OmniBazaar extends this concept to also include incentives for those who publish listings for others, provide escrow services, facilitate privacy in the network, etc. We strongly believe that without such a system of fees and incentives, a marketplace economic system like OmniBazaar would fail, due to the ""tragedy of the commons"".</p>
<p>There is an open-source distributed marketplace project under development that aims to operate without any fees. We believe this effort is doomed to fail for the reasons given above.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>How will the developers benefit?</h4>
<p>The development team is a ""service provider"" in the marketplace, just like the Publishers, Escrow Agents, Promoters, and Privacy Facilitators. So, the developers will receive <b>a portion of the transaction fees</b> from marketplace transactions, just like other service providers. We are planning for that fee to be one fourth of one percent <b>(0.25%)</b> for both buyers and sellers. And yes, we are planning to make it mandatory -- at least in the beginning. We understand that some people may be incensed (or even enraged) by this. But we believe that most users of the marketplace will consider it reasonable and fair. After all, OmniBazaar will save sellers about 80% of the fees they would pay if they sell on Amazon or eBay. This will naturally also result in lower prices for buyers.</p>
<br/><h4>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How will you avoid criminals and terrorists? </span><br/>
</h4>
<p>We believe people are basically good, and that the vast majority of people have no interest in engaging in criminal activities. So, we are focused on protecting the rights and privacy of the honest majority, instead of worrying about the criminal few. Attempts to ""stop criminals"" have too often been used as an excuse to decrease personal privacy and freedoms. </p>
<p>We are building into OmniBazaar a <b>self-policing</b> system that will allow users to flag prohibited content. If a product receives a certain number of flags, that product will (essentially) be removed from the system. We have also designed a ""reputation"" system that will <b>penalize sellers who list prohibited content.</b></p>
<p>We have designed OmniBazaar to be a better alternative to Amazon and eBay, not to be the next Silk Road.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>When did the OmniBazaar/OmniCoin/CryptoBazaar project start?</h4>
<p>The first complete technical description of the peer-to-peer shopping marketplace concept was <b>published in August, 2013</b>. OmniBazaar Inc. was incorporated in September 2013, to develop the project. By December 2013 we put together our core team, had a Private Placement Offering ready, further developed the technology, created two videos describing the project, and generated various marketing materials. In <b>January 2014, we introduced OmniBazaar and the cooperative distributed marketplace concept at ""Bitcoin Miami"".</b> Since that time, we have been working largely ""under the radar"", and have now programmed the core marketplace application and the wallet for OmniCoin.</p>

<h3>Why $50,000?</h3>
<p>We are raising this money to complete the development of OmniCoin and the OmniBazaar software. We need to hire several programmers to complete various parts of the project.</p>
<p>Good programmers are expensive, and we need good programmers. We're close to releasing OmniCoin and OmniBazaar, but there is still some programming left to do. Achieving our goal here in the crowd-funding phase will allow us to complete the release versions of OmniCoin and the marketplace software. That will help us raise the rest of the money to make the marketplace successful. It will also show potential equity investors that we have community interest<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> and user </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">support</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>

</div></div>","We're raising money for a peer-to-peer marketplace that will revolutionize the way e-commerce is done. Contributors will receive OmniCoins to spend in the OmniBazaar marketplace. We already have a working Windows prototype of the software. Donations will fund further development of OmniBazaar and OmniCoin software. Please watch the videos and read the campaign.Seen On:





OmniBazaar -- Removing Middlemen and Bankers from E-commerce
OmniBazaar is a new type of e-commerce marketplace that removes the middlemen and bankers from e-commerce. OmniBazaar will allow users to buy and sell directly among themselves (rather than through a middleman site like Amazon or eBay), using Bitcoin and OmniCoin (instead of credit cards or PayPal). By using a distributed structure to eliminate the middlemen, and using Bitcoin and OmniCoin to eliminate the bankers, OmniBazaar will be able to charge users about 80% lower fees than existing e-commerce sites like eBay and Amazon. 
OmniBazaar will also serve the 2.5 billion ""un-banked"" people world-wide who cannot use existing e-commerce sites, because those sites require users to have credit cards and bank accounts. 
Participants anywhere in the world will be able to buy and sell in the OmniBazaar marketplace without bank accounts, credit cards, application forms, or credit checks, using only their computer, smartphone, or tablet.
Individuals and small businesses will transact business among themselves using a free version of the OmniBazaar software to list and shop for products and services. Users will pay no fees to join the marketplace, no fees to shop or post listings, and no monthly or annual membership fees. Users will pay only a small (~1%) fee on each transaction to support service providers in the marketplace network.
The marketplace technology to accomplish this has been designed, programmed, and a working prototype created. Funding we receive in this campaign will enable us to complete the development of OmniCoin and the OmniBazaar marketplace software.
Screen shots from our working prototype Windows application:






Our Mission
We are creating a new economic and financial system “of the people, by the people, for the people”. We are enabling e-commerce without the middleman, and payment without bankers.
We are building a secure, efficient, decentralized, online marketplace, where individuals trade directly with other individuals, instead of with multinational corporations. Participants will use currency based on mathematics and technology, instead of belief in a central government, and interact within a monetary system based on production and assets, instead of debt created by central banks.


Our Values

Individual liberty, Internet privacy, market freedom, and financial responsibility 
Building a sustainable, asset-based, independent economic system
Bringing e-commerce to half the world's population who don't have bank accounts
Getting cryptocurrencies into broad use by average people around the world
Encouraging and promoting local, mobile, and social commerce







CryptoBazaar -- Enabling Anonymous E-commerce
The CryptoBazaar upgrade for the OmniBazaar software will allow you to buy and sell anonymously through the OmniBazaar marketplace, by using advanced software that can ""cloak"" your computer's internet address, and allow you to preserve as much personal privacy as you choose. The CryptoBazaar upgrade will include access to a peer-to-peer escrow service, provided cooperatively by other CryptoBazaar users, that will allow secure transactions between buyers and sellers who don't know or trust each other.
CryptoBazaar will also provide a secure, escrowed,  distributed  cryptocurrency  exchange. Imagine being able to buy and sell  cryptocurrencies  without relying on a centralized exchange.







New Currency for a New Marketplace
OmniCoin (XOM) is the digital currency of the OmniBazaar marketplace. People will use Bitcoins and OmniCoins to buy and sell goods and services in the OmniBazaar marketplace. The value of OmniCoins will “float” freely compared to other currencies, and the value of OmniCoins will be based on the value of the goods and services they can buy in the marketplace.
OmniCoin is simple and secure to use. It is privacy-friendly, because it allows you to choose to conduct transactions that are either transparent or anonymous. Transaction processing takes seconds instead of minutes, so OmniCoin is business-friendly. Transaction processing uses relatively little computing power, so OmniCoin is eco-friendly. And, with OmniCoin, you can do transactions using an account name instead of a string of numbers. This makes OmniCoin user-friendly.
Beginning at the launch of OmniBazaar and OmniCoin, we will start giving away all 20,000,000,000 OmniCoins to users of the OmniBazaar marketplace. Each new user will receive a few thousand OmniCoins when they register, and additional coins when they refer a friend or do transactions in the marketplace.
We want tens or hundreds of millions of people to eventually become owners of OmniCoin and users of the OmniBazaar marketplace. So, we will give away billions of coins to millions of people who join, refer their friends, do transactions in the marketplace, and provide the services and infrastructure for the marketplace.
In the beginning, OmniCoins will be free. But, as thousand, millions, or billions of people use them in the OmniBazaar marketplace, OmniCoins will find a value, as any currency does, based on the confidence people have that they can use OmniCoin to purchase valuable goods and services.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Why create another cryptocurrency? Why not just use Bitcoin?
There are several reasons. Bitcoin is not particularly anonymous, so we are designing OmniCoin to be more private. An address for receiving Bitcoin looks like this: 15r8p9bbciYyjn3Jo1o4UEne7XKAXPCTM3, while an address for receiving OmniCoin looks like this: Alice_B. Bitcoin takes up to an hour to generate six confirmations of validity for a transaction, whereas OmniCoin will generate six confirmations in under a minute. Confirming Bitcoin transactions is very energy-intensive, but confirming OmniCoins is done using a small fraction of the energy and a fraction of the time. OmniCoin is also designed to be better than Bitcoin at accommodating the ""micro-payment"" transactions that will occur when marketplace service providers are paid a small percentage of the transaction fees from a transaction. We're also building OmniCoin with a simple, automated escrow feature that doesn't exist in other Bitcoin wallets, and a reputation tracking feature that doesn't exist anywhere in Bitcoin (that we know of). Finally, by creating a token specifically for the OmniBazaar marketplace we believe we can make the marketplace more useful and robust.
Having said all that, we are building OmniBazaar to operate with both Bitcoin and OmniCoin.


Wait a minute! Are you saying you plan to dump 20 billion OmniCoins onto the market when OmniBazaar launches?
No. Absolutely not.
The number of coins in circulation will be completely determined by how many people join and use the OmniBazaar marketplace. We will give only a small (relative to the eventual 20 billion) number of coins to each person who joins OmniBazaar, and an even smaller number of coins for referring a friend. We will distribute half the coins in this manner, over the span of as many months or years as it takes to distribute them all. We will distribute the other 10 billion coins as ""reverse transaction fees"" when users conduct transactions with each other in the marketplace. In other words, during the initial distribution period, we will essentially pay users a small OmniCoin bonus to buy or sell something in the marketplace.
We haven't finalized the numbers yet, but let's say we give 1,000 OmniCoins to each new user who joins OmniBazaar. This represents one twenty-millionth (1/20,000,000) of the total eventual coin supply. That would be a much slower emission rate than most other coins have. We could give 10,000 coins to each new user and still have a slow emission rate. We think this is infinitely more rational and fair than most other recently introduced cryptocurrencies (especially the ones that generate all the coins in just a few weeks to enrich the developers and their friends). And we believe this distribution plan will add liquidity at the rate that is needed by the marketplace. As more people join, more OmniCoins will come into circulation. Similarly, we estimate that users will do hundreds of millions of transactions in the marketplace before the ""reverse transaction fee"" pool of coins is completely distributed.
How can OmniCoins have value if you are giving them away?

When most cryptocurrencies launch, they make a point of promoting the wonderful new features of the coin itself, with the idea that those features are somehow the basis of its value. We are taking a completely different (and radical) approach. We believe that the value of any currency lies only in the confidence people have that it can be used, today or in the near future, to acquire valuable goods and services. People can come to perceive a unit of currency as an investment, if they believe it will be more useful (valuable) in the future. But that is a different concept than its value (usefulness) as a currency today.
We are giving away 20 billion OmniCoin to emphasize the fact that any cryptocurrency, by itself, is absolutely worthless. It is nothing more than some bits and bytes pushed across the Internet. Only the usefulness of a cryptocurrency gives it any value. So, we are creating a simple, secure, cooperative, distributed marketplace where OmniCoins can easily be used, and allowing OmniCoin to find its own value. If we do a good job of making the marketplace easy, safe, and inexpensive to use, and create OmniCoin with advanced features that make it useful in that marketplace, we feel certain that both OmniBazaar and OmniCoin will prosper. The price of OmniCoins may be low in the beginning. But, the more they become useful (and are used), the higher the value (and price) will become.
Why charge transaction fees for services? If the marketplace is cooperative, why isn't it free?
Without charges for consumers of services, and incentives for providers of services, the OmniBazaar marketplace would experience a phenomenon known as the ""tragedy of the commons"".    The creator of Bitcoin avoided this problem, with respect to transaction processing and network security, by providing a financial incentive for the Bitcoin ""miners"" who provide these services. OmniBazaar extends this concept to also include incentives for those who publish listings for others, provide escrow services, facilitate privacy in the network, etc. We strongly believe that without such a system of fees and incentives, a marketplace economic system like OmniBazaar would fail, due to the ""tragedy of the commons"".
There is an open-source distributed marketplace project under development that aims to operate without any fees. We believe this effort is doomed to fail for the reasons given above.

How will the developers benefit?
The development team is a ""service provider"" in the marketplace, just like the Publishers, Escrow Agents, Promoters, and Privacy Facilitators. So, the developers will receive a portion of the transaction fees from marketplace transactions, just like other service providers. We are planning for that fee to be one fourth of one percent (0.25%) for both buyers and sellers. And yes, we are planning to make it mandatory -- at least in the beginning. We understand that some people may be incensed (or even enraged) by this. But we believe that most users of the marketplace will consider it reasonable and fair. After all, OmniBazaar will save sellers about 80% of the fees they would pay if they sell on Amazon or eBay. This will naturally also result in lower prices for buyers.

How will you avoid criminals and terrorists? 

We believe people are basically good, and that the vast majority of people have no interest in engaging in criminal activities. So, we are focused on protecting the rights and privacy of the honest majority, instead of worrying about the criminal few. Attempts to ""stop criminals"" have too often been used as an excuse to decrease personal privacy and freedoms. 
We are building into OmniBazaar a self-policing system that will allow users to flag prohibited content. If a product receives a certain number of flags, that product will (essentially) be removed from the system. We have also designed a ""reputation"" system that will penalize sellers who list prohibited content.
We have designed OmniBazaar to be a better alternative to Amazon and eBay, not to be the next Silk Road.
When did the OmniBazaar/OmniCoin/CryptoBazaar project start?
The first complete technical description of the peer-to-peer shopping marketplace concept was published in August, 2013. OmniBazaar Inc. was incorporated in September 2013, to develop the project. By December 2013 we put together our core team, had a Private Placement Offering ready, further developed the technology, created two videos describing the project, and generated various marketing materials. In January 2014, we introduced OmniBazaar and the cooperative distributed marketplace concept at ""Bitcoin Miami"". Since that time, we have been working largely ""under the radar"", and have now programmed the core marketplace application and the wallet for OmniCoin.

Why donate?


Would you like to pay less for stuff when you shop on-line?

Would you like to help us bring e-commerce to half of the world's population?
Do you support the development and use of alternative currencies?

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, please show your support with a donation of any size.

Why $50,000?
We are raising this money to complete the development of OmniCoin and the OmniBazaar software. We need to hire several programmers to complete various parts of the project.
Good programmers are expensive, and we need good programmers. We're close to releasing OmniCoin and OmniBazaar, but there is still some programming left to do. Achieving our goal here in the crowd-funding phase will allow us to complete the release versions of OmniCoin and the marketplace software. That will help us raise the rest of the money to make the marketplace successful. It will also show potential equity investors that we have community interest and user support.
(If you are a ""rock-star"" programmer, and believe OmniCoin and OmniBazaar are exciting, please contact us. You might be able to help us revolutionize the way e-commerce is done.)

OmniCoin is still also still under development. The images (coming soon) on this page are actual screen shots of the wallet, but that wallet is not yet completely functional.
OmniBazaar Inc. has been developing OmniBazaar and OmniCoin for over a year. We are building OmniBazaar and OmniCoin using technology and algorithms that have already been proven to work. We have a team of talented developers, each of whom is an expert in his field. We are therefore confident in our ability to complete the project as it has been described here.
The following tasks remain to complete OmniBazaar and OmniCoin:



Program, test and debug the OmniCoin multi-signature distributed escrow system. 


Program, test and debug the OmniBazaar/OmniCoin distributed user reputation system. 


Create “lite” clients for Windows, OSX, Android, and iPhone. 


Compile full-node executables for Linux and OSX. 


Integrate IP obfuscation for complete anonymity.


Integrate “OmniChat” secure communication module. 


Increase scalability of the OmniBazaar distributed database. 


Design and program the OmniCoin initial distribution system.


Risks:



Our software design, engineering, and test processes are rigorous and focused on producing high quality, well tested products. As we move towards final integration and testing of OmniBazaar and OmniCoin, we may learn that additional revision is needed to meet our quality standards. This may delay the delivery schedule.


The remaining tasks may take longer than expected to complete.


The rate at which we are able to complete the remaining tasks to launch OmniBazaar and OmniCoin will be determined to a considerable extent by the success of this IndieGoGo campaign. Meeting or exceeding our goal will allow us to launch more quickly.
