<p>The Rock &amp; Roll Parody Musical of Flash Gordon Featuring the Music and Songs of QUEEN!</p>
<p>My name is Steve Coker.  I am the creator and producer of Flash Ah-Ahhh!!!  I live in Portland Oregon and have been producing original works and parody stage productions for the past six years. Our first two productions were live adaptations of my own original works: Varsity Cheerleader Werewolves From Outer Space:</p>

<p>After that we started working on Parodies of 80s and 90s comedies such as: Xanadu, John Water's Cry-Baby and The Three Amigos.  We have had great successes with all of our shows... but Flash Ah-Ahhh!! seems to be tho one people most gravitate to.  Each time we run it, people will pay to see the show several times. One person even bought a ticket for every performance in 2016.</p>
<p>We are going to mount Flash Ah-Ahhh!!! in November this year... it will be the fifth anniversary of the show and seemed the perfect time to bring back many of the original cast.  It is our goal to make the costumes and props better than ever and to film a professional 4 camera shoot of the show to use for proof of concept to producers and investors. We'd love to see this show get all the attention it deserves. </p>
<ul>
<li>A wider audience for such an incredible show..</li>
<li>The ability to obtain the music rights for the 14 Queen songs featured in the show.</li>
<li>Possible productions outside the Pacific Northwest.</li>
<li>And really, just a kick ass video to share.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise at least $5000.00 for this production.  We will be spending the funds in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3000.00 for Video Production Costs: <ul>
<li>Camera/Sound Rentals</li>
<li>Proficient Professional Crew</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$2000.00 for Stage Production Costs<ul>
<li>$500.00 for Costume Design and construction</li>
<li>$150.00 for Prop Design and construction</li>
<li>$500.00 Printing of fliers, posters and handbills</li>
<li>$350.00 for Print/Media Advertising</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For your generous contribution, you will receive some fun merchandise and perks... listed on the Fund Project page.</li>
<li>If we do not achieve the entire amount we are seeking, we will still use the funds for the show and we will still make a video, but the quality of the camera equipment may need to be of lesser value.  IF we make more than the set goal, we will apply it toward increasing the quality of the production, additional promotional materials and to pay our cast and crew for their talent and time.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks in investing in artistic endeavors, but i can assure you that I know how to budget and use funds in amazing ways.  Generally I create impactful productions with limited budgets. I was the Production Manager for Chambers Productions/KEZI News in Eugene and was constantly working under high time pressure and budget restraints.  I have a long record of producing quality work on a budget. You can feel safe knowing your contribution will go to making the finest quality production possible</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometime people aren't in the position to contribute monetarily, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share this project page with people in your world... friends, neighbors and business leaders who might resonate with this project.  You can easily do that by using the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<h3>HOW TO HELP ""HERE OR THERE: A NEW MUSICAL""</h3>
<p>Matt Clark and Liam Searcy (with help from Jordy Searcy) are bringing a new musical to life. We need your help- the next step for our show to come to life is paying an arranger to help chart the chords we have for the song into real-life sheet music. Arrangers charge roughly $100 a song, and with 8 songs in ""Here or There"" that's an $800 expense. We truly believe in this project, and any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Here or There"" follows Kate, in the bus station of the small town she's called home for the past 28 years as she decides whether or not to get on the bus out of town- leaving her life behind her, and starting fresh. Throughout the course of the one-act musical, featuring 8 brand new songs by Liam Searcy, Kate discovers more of who she is as she's forced to face her past, present, and future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyone who donates will receive a personalized thank you message from the first rehearsal after we have sheet music, as well as an inside look at us playing the music off of sheet music for the first time!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.houseofdov.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>House of DOV</strong></a> has been working with collaborators over the past 9 months to create a new work entitled ""delirium (honesty)"" set to <strong>premiere July 23rd</strong> at the <strong>Adler Planetarium</strong> in Chicago, IL. We have brought together an incredible group of artists across mediums including dance, film, photography, fashion, and DJ. The project includes a fabulous cast of dancers Ingrid Ferdinand, Maddy Joss, Alexandra Webb, and Hannah Marcus, handmade costumes by Jeremy Miller, and live DJ set by Tushrik Fredericks. The evening of dance will also include special guests HOMESICK Productions (NY) and <a href=""https://www.clubshamoun.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">C-LS/Club Shamoun</a> (NY).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have been so lucky to be working with various organizations to put on this event, including the Adler Planetarium, Momenta Performing Arts Company, The Academy of Movement and Music, Palette &amp; Chisel Art Academy, and See Chicago Dance. There are many budget line items that we are asking for help with. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Venue and Catering Fees</strong></li>
<li>Stage Rental</li>
<li><strong>Artist Fees</strong></li>
<li>Handmade Costumes by Jeremy Miller</li>
<li>Travel costs for out of town performers</li>
<li>Documentation Fees</li>
<li>Sound Equipment Fees</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>During a time where we all are so starved for live performance and the community energy that it creates, we feel more than ever that Chicago needs this. As a group of <strong>emerging artists</strong>, we are truly on the precipice of crossing a <strong>major threshold</strong> in our careers. After my own career performing in New York and touring nationally and internationally since graduating college in 2016, I have pivoted during this time to focus on movement research, pedagogy, and my own creations. This event is both the <strong>World Premiere</strong> of a <strong>life-giving work</strong>, but also my debut as a Chicago Dancemaker with an ensemble group. </p>
<p>House of DOV is also committed to the concept of artwork as a way of forming community. That is why this performance will also be including performances by two other performing arts companies: <strong>HOMESICK Productions</strong> presenting a new solo ""Show &amp; Tell"" and <strong>C-LS</strong> with the return of acclaimed work ""NO FALSE IDOLS."" Both companies bring an exciting and bold language of movement, and represent the ethics and commitment to community, diversity, and innovation that House of DOV holds close.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Rewards</h3>
<p>As you can imagine, it been incredibly difficult to put together a show during the pandemic. In debuting this work I was intent on producing a live piece of performance, not something virtual. I spent months searching for an outdoor venue that could handle the capacity of a large audience, and was willing to work with me on something like this during the time of COVID. That is how we landed on the <strong>Adler Planetarium</strong>, with it's beautiful outdoor space that faces the <strong>Chicago Skyline</strong>. I hope that you will help us actualize this show and realize that, especially at a time like this, we need your help. It is always difficult getting a show off the ground, but this season has come with its own special difficulties. Help us to reimagine the possibilities of live performance in this city; the payoff is going to be incredible.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>My name is G.R. Smith. I run The Washington Shakespearean Festival. To get into the mind of an Elizabethan poet/playwright, I have written over 2,000 sonnets, and more than one Shakespearean-style script.

That way, no matter what the audience wants to have happen, the piece responds in a way that furthers an artistic dialogue rather than devolving into a meandering choose-your-own-adventure. We believe that this type of interactive experience is absolutely necessary to effectively communicate with new audiences in this age of digital connectivity and personalization.</span><br/></p><p>The software we hope to eventually build is incredibly complex, and to fully flesh it out requires much more time and money. In this limited engagement we hope to use our resources to develop a highly functional prototype of the system to see if at it's core it is an engaging experience. If so, we hope to seriously continue developing this on a larger scale with high quality documentation of this version serving as serious proof of concept for further steps.</p><p><br/></p><p>We deeply appreciate any and all contributions you'd be willing to make to our crazy and harebrained endeavor.</p><p><br/></p><p>Can't join the circus this time?

You’re probably asking — well, where’s my money going? Here’s how we’re spending it:$4,000 goes to SALARIES! For our performers, designers, stage managers, technicians and stagehands.
$1,400 goes to our performers

$1,400 goes to our designers and their assistants

$600 goes to our stage management team
$600 goes to our technicians who will construct and load in the show’s set, and light and sound systems
$1,000 goes to Budgets for our scenic and costume designers to purchase materials to fabricate their brilliant designs$400 goes to Budgets for our lighting and sound designers to rent lighting and sound equipment that can work with our interactive voting system$700 goes to a marketing budget that will help us develop an audience$700 goes to salaries and resources to develop a smartphone voting system that can interact with our lighting and sound systems in the theaterThat last item is critical because this will all be made possible by an elaborate software we're designing which processes dozens of signals from each audience member, evaluates their decisions and then sifts through all the subsequent narrative possibilities to find the ones that make the most dramatic sense based off of the audience's previous input. That way, no matter what the audience wants to have happen, the piece responds in a way that furthers an artistic dialogue rather than devolving into a meandering choose-your-own-adventure. We believe that this type of interactive experience is absolutely necessary to effectively communicate with new audiences in this age of digital connectivity and personalization.The software we hope to eventually build is incredibly complex, and to fully flesh it out requires much more time and money. In this limited engagement we hope to use our resources to develop a highly functional prototype of the system to see if at it's core it is an engaging experience. If so, we hope to seriously continue developing this on a larger scale with high quality documentation of this version serving as serious proof of concept for further steps.We deeply appreciate any and all contributions you'd be willing to make to our crazy and harebrained endeavor.Can't join the circus this time?

<p>Ibuka Dance Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, provides a scholarship training program called ""A Chance to Dance"" for talented young East Africans from disadvantaged backgrounds. Ibuka is the Swahili word meaning ""to rise"", and we believe that anyone 
regardless of socioeconomic class can rise through Dance! In Tanzania, there is much untapped talent; dancers lack professional training and opportunities. Our mission is to secure a place in society for dance to be accepted as a
 profession, requiring full time dedication to attain an international level worthy of funding and support. We serve as a hub for dance to promote and preserve culture in East Africa, and provide a much needed space for dance to be taught, created and performed.<br/></p><p><em>You can learn more about us at <a href=""http://ibukadance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ibukadance.org</a>.</em></p><p><em>                                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432025776/dbzxz3wlfa2g6nohlkte.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 277.58680555555554px; height: 295px;""/></em></p><p></p><div>

<b>Ibuka's Impact</b>
</h3>
<br/>Arusha is a pivotal fast-growing town in the heart of  East 
Africa, and is the seat of the East African Community. As it thrives on safari tourism, support for the arts is minimal, and Ibuka is a key player in this emerging field. With a shortage of cultural institutions and an abundance of talent, Tanzania has inspired Ibuka to establish a hub for culture, creating a network and a space for artists in East Africa. </div><div>Our training program feeds into our dance company and creates top level dancers and teachers, who then disseminate dance through our outreach workshops and educational pieces. We support the community projects by performing at commercial events and functions, and by teaching the general public with our daily open classes at the centre. All the pieces of the puzzle fit together, and each branch of Ibuka supports the others. It is an ideal model for a sustainable cultural organization that enriches society through promoting and preserving traditions, creating cross-cultural bridges and alliances, and through education and employment.</div><div>
<b>Outreach Workshops &amp; Edutainment</b><br/>
<p>Ibuka creates dance pieces that provide community education,
addressing issues such as violence, environmental issues, gender 
equality, and health, which are often difficult or taboo to talk about. 
We do workshops with children based on the theme of the performance they
 viewed, using non-verbal
communication as a powerful tool for healing, understanding, expression,
 and social change. We call this ""Dance Activism"" and have done outreach
 at children's homes, orphanages, schools and community centers.</p>

<h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
<p>Ibuka was founded by Canadian Anna Bussey in April 2014. She 
graduated with honors from the ballet high school of Les Grand Ballets 
Canadiens in Montreal and went on scholarship to the renowned 
John-Cranko Shule academy of the Stuttgart Ballet (Germany) and 
completed her 
dance education with a degree at the Rotterdam Dansacademie (Holland). 
She has danced and 
taught in world class companies such as:  The Copenhagen International 
Ballet (Denmark), La Compagnie Thor (Belgium), the Cirque du Soleil 
(Canada) and Compagnia Zappala 
Danza (Italy).</p>

<p>After 3 decades of thriving as a dancer in the West, 
she knew it was her time to give back, and realized that the 
opportunities she had received in Canada and Europe 
throughout her dance education and career were not a 
reality for the talented, tenacious and inspirational artists she met in
 Africa. After many return visits to Tanzania, initially to visit her 
sister who lived in Arusha,  Anna took the initiative to fulfill her 
vision and fill a cultural gap, and she began mobilizing people to 
create a center for dance and the performing arts. </p>
<p>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432029533/pvhxuhuptwzpnxs3ljap.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>She is dedicated to building a platform for a dance community to 
thrive and giving performing artists a structure required to reach their
 maximum potential.  The momentum that this has gathered in the East 
African community has been remarkable over the past year, showing 
Ibuka's team we are on the right path and that an infrastructure for 
dance is indeed sorely needed. We are inspiring each other!</p>

<h3>Pamoja, Swahili for Together</h3>
<p>Pamoja, we can rise! Your involvement gives these incredible young artists a chance to dance!</p>
<p> Whether big or small, your donation will go directly to rebuilding a home for dance for so many, so that they can reach their full potential. <br/></p>
<p>Finally, some good news from Africa! The rebuilding of a pioneering Tanzanian theater from the ground up is about to happen right now, with you! So please be the change you want to see, make your money matter, and receive some wonderful perks in the process, like an Ibuka Dance calendar and a place on our plaque at the new venue. </p>
<p>Another great way to help us reach our crowd funding goal is to spread the word to your family, friends, and people you know who are committed to changing the world for better through art.</p>
<p> Sharing is caring, so please take a moment to do so through Facebook, Twitter, e-mail and the Indiegogo share tools. Ibuka cannot rise alone!<br/></p>

We  have 10 full time staff organizing and dancing for the foundation, and plan to create 10 more jobs in the next year.

Students will receive a certificate on completion of the first year, and we are working toward offering a diploma. By 2017 we aim to have set up a Dance degree program with the local university, Makumira.

create a center for dance and the performing arts. 
                                 
She is dedicated to building a platform for a dance community to 
thrive and giving performing artists a structure required to reach their
 maximum potential.  The momentum that this has gathered in the East 
African community has been remarkable over the past year, showing 
Ibuka's team we are on the right path and that an infrastructure for 
dance is indeed sorely needed. We are inspiring each other!
Anna choreographing in the original space before the rainy season began...

Pamoja, Swahili for Together
Pamoja, we can rise! Your involvement gives these incredible young artists a chance to dance!
 Whether big or small, your donation will go directly to rebuilding a home for dance for so many, so that they can reach their full potential. 
Finally, some good news from Africa! The rebuilding of a pioneering Tanzanian theater from the ground up is about to happen right now, with you! So please be the change you want to see, make your money matter, and receive some wonderful perks in the process, like an Ibuka Dance calendar and a place on our plaque at the new venue. 
Another great way to help us reach our crowd funding goal is to spread the word to your family, friends, and people you know who are committed to changing the world for better through art.
 Sharing is caring, so please take a moment to do so through Facebook, Twitter, e-mail and the Indiegogo share tools. Ibuka cannot rise alone!
With Heartfelt gratitude from the whole Ibuka Dance Team

<strong>Free Lunch Academy</strong> is a <strong>non-profit artistic outreach program</strong> that is dedicated to deterring violence, diminishing bullying, and mentoring students through the use of <strong>performance arts</strong>. Founded in October of 2012 by Creative Director, Calvin King,<br/>who sought to provide students in Chicago with the necessary tools to safely<br/>mediate the occurrence of violence and bullying that is too often experienced<br/>in classrooms, through artistic expression. Our programs are designed to both<br/>entertain and educate students on various methods that can be used to safely<br/>resolve issues of anger, resentment and threats of violence. </div><div>
</div><div>One way in which this objective is reached is by partnering with schools throughout the Chicagoland area to provide their students with the one of a kind stage<br/>experience known affectionately as, <strong>“The Greatest Teacher”</strong> (anti-bullying stage<br/>play). To date we have performed at over <strong>25</strong> different schools in the city of Chicago and we have received such tremendous feedback from our school partnerships and their students. We want to continue our efforts by growing our number of school performances and take “The Greatest Teacher” on the road. However, producing these shows across the Chicagoland area can be quite expensive -from transportation costs, video editing, branding material, and student giveaways.  </div><div>
</div><div>Our goal for this campaign is to raise <strong>$15,000</strong> in 45 days to cover all<br/>costs related to successfully producing our show, The Greatest Teacher, during<strong> </strong>the <span><strong>2015-16</strong> academic school. The funds raised will help us produce an awesome show for students who need it most, at <strong>no cost to them</strong>! Through your support we can reach <strong>over fifty (50) schools,</strong> that's at least <strong> 20,000</strong> students in the Chicagoland area! Bullying is a issue, and far too many times it is looked over. We believe there is an indirect correlation between the rise in bullying and the increase in violence our city has been experiencing over the last few years. </span>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes || What we need and what you get<br/>
</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>El
mayor problema surgido es causado por los vestuarios, al ser 9, no
todas cuentan con el fondo económico necesario para poder pagárselos
y por eso se recurre a la opción de crowdfunding, aparte de recaudar el dinero, nos daríamos más a conocer.<br/></p>
<p>Con la financiación pedida (500USD) podríamos hacernos cargo de:</p>
<ul>
<li>Los vestuarios de las chicas que no se lo pueden financiar.</li>
<li>Ayudar económicamente con el traslado de algunas chicas, que no son de la provincia y son indispensables por su talento.</li>
<li>Merchandising: queremos comercializar con nuestra imagen y así no volver a depender de un crowdfunding, que supone un esfuerzo para todo el mundo, a la par que seguir promocionándonos.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><i>Tened en cuenta que si se llega a la meta de 500$, nunca
recibiremos ese dinero íntegro debido a las tasas e impuestos que
genera hacer un crowdfunding.</i><br/>=======================================================</i><br/>The biggest problem encountered is due to the outfits. Not all of us 
have the money necessary for paying them, so we have to turn to 
crowdfunding, as besides raising the money, it'll help make ourselves 
better known.<br/><br/>With the requested funding (500USD) we could take care of:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The costumes for the girls that cannot buy them themselves.<br/>
</li>
<li><p>Help transport some girls who aren't from the province and are needed for their talent.</p></li>
<li><p>Merchandising: we want to commercialize our image, and thus not have to 
rely on crowdfunding. At the same time we want to keep promoting 
ourselves.<br/>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p><i>If we reach the goal of 500USD, keep in mind that we will never receive 
all of the money due to fees and taxes generated by making a 
crowdfunding.</i><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>El impacto || The impact<br/>
</h3> <p>Nuestro objetivo es participar como animadoras en lo mayormente posible de eventos manganime que haya en España, marcando un hito ya que anteriormente no se ha hecho una actividad como esta, de tal calibre.<br/></p>
<p>Con vuestra colaboración, conseguiremos aumentar nuestra credibilidad, ya que una buena presencia es un gran factor, sumando que nos daremos más a conocer con la promoción de este crowdfunding.<br/></p>Contamos con el respaldo de la popularidad de una de las líderes, quien ya tiene experiencia en el mundo del espectáculo y en la cultura idol. Añadiendo que no es la primera vez que servidora organiza un evento, ya que ha participado en la creación de un mercado artesanal y en actividades orientadas a la cultura maid. <br/><i>=======================================================</i><br/><p></p>
<div><div><div><span><span>Our goal is participate as entertainers in most of manganime conventions in Spain, marking a milestone because there hasn't been much of that kind of activity on our country.<br/>With your help, we will increase our credibility, because a good presence is a big factor, adding that we will become more known due to the promotion of this crowdfunding.<br/>We have the support of one of the leaders, who already has experience in the entertainment world and the idol culture and is rather popular. Adding that it isn't the first time that I organize an event, I took part in the making of a craft market and maid culture oriented activities.</span></span></div></div></div>
<br/><h3>Recompensas || Rewards<br/>
</h3>Sobre las recompensas, una vez que hayamos adquirido los trajes, nos pondremos de inmediato con la sesión de fotos para que recibais vuestras recompensas lo antes posible. En todo caso, mientras se vayan recibiendo las solicitudes, el merchandising que no sean fotografías, será realizado de inmediato para evitar retrasos.<br/>Poco a poco iremos actualizando con imágenes del merchandising. 
Ｏ(≧▽≦)Ｏ<br/>========================================================<br/><p>About rewards, once we've acquired the costumes, we 
will immediately do a photoshoot so you can receive your rewards as soon
 as possible. As we get applications for rewards, non-photo 
merchandising will be crafted immediately to avoid delays.</p>
<p>Step by step, we'll update with pictures of merchandising. O(≧ ▽ ≦)O</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Riesgos y desafíos || Risks and Challenges</h3>El mayor riesgo para no conseguir nuestra meta sería no
llegar a recaudar todo el dinero que necesitamos.  Pero realmente, eso no sería una novedad y nosotras no estamos dispuestas a que eso nos sea un impedimento, así que una vez que comience la campaña, todas haremos la mayor promoción posible (ya a raíz de nuestra gran base de popularidad), incluso pidiendo ayuda a las grandes empresas relacionadas con este mundo. Contamos con el gancho del merchandising de las recompensas, algo asequible y que se facilita su envío a todas partes del país e incluso internacional.<br/>========================================================<br/>There's always the risk that we don't reach the amount of funding we 
need. But really, that wouldn't be a novelty and we aren't going to 
give up because of it. Every one of us will promote the campaign as much
 as possible, even asking large companies for help. We have the hook of 
merchandising rewards, cheap and easy to deliver across Spain and even 
internationally.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar || Other ways you can help<br/>
</h3>Si ves que no puedes ayudar
económicamente, aún puedes ayudarnos haciendo promoción y
difundiendo este evento para que salga adelante. Te lo agradeceremos
de corazón, y si nos lo comunicas, te lo agradeceremos
manuscritamente en el tablón de los agradecimientos que pensamos
crear.<br/><p>========================================================<br/>If you see that you can't help financially, you can still help by 
promoting and sharing this event. We'd appreciate that from the bottom 
of our heart, and if you show us you've spread information about this 
campaign, we'll express our gratitude by writing your name on a ""Thank 
you"" board we're planning on making.</p>

idols from ""Love Live School Idol Project"". After nine girls gathered to
 fill the roles, they've been rehearsing the choreographies and 
practicing to do their best.
Las chicas || The cast





   Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes || What we need and what you get
 

El
mayor problema surgido es causado por los vestuarios, al ser 9, no
todas cuentan con el fondo económico necesario para poder pagárselos
y por eso se recurre a la opción de crowdfunding, aparte de recaudar el dinero, nos daríamos más a conocer.
Con la financiación pedida (500USD) podríamos hacernos cargo de:

Los vestuarios de las chicas que no se lo pueden financiar.
Ayudar económicamente con el traslado de algunas chicas, que no son de la provincia y son indispensables por su talento.
Merchandising: queremos comercializar con nuestra imagen y así no volver a depender de un crowdfunding, que supone un esfuerzo para todo el mundo, a la par que seguir promocionándonos.

Tened en cuenta que si se llega a la meta de 500$, nunca
recibiremos ese dinero íntegro debido a las tasas e impuestos que
genera hacer un crowdfunding.=======================================================The biggest problem encountered is due to the outfits. Not all of us 
have the money necessary for paying them, so we have to turn to 
crowdfunding, as besides raising the money, it'll help make ourselves 
better known.With the requested funding (500USD) we could take care of:

The costumes for the girls that cannot buy them themselves.

Help transport some girls who aren't from the province and are needed for their talent.
Merchandising: we want to commercialize our image, and thus not have to 
rely on crowdfunding. At the same time we want to keep promoting 
ourselves.


If we reach the goal of 500USD, keep in mind that we will never receive 
all of the money due to fees and taxes generated by making a 
crowdfunding.
  El impacto || The impact
 Nuestro objetivo es participar como animadoras en lo mayormente posible de eventos manganime que haya en España, marcando un hito ya que anteriormente no se ha hecho una actividad como esta, de tal calibre.
Con vuestra colaboración, conseguiremos aumentar nuestra credibilidad, ya que una buena presencia es un gran factor, sumando que nos daremos más a conocer con la promoción de este crowdfunding.Contamos con el respaldo de la popularidad de una de las líderes, quien ya tiene experiencia en el mundo del espectáculo y en la cultura idol. Añadiendo que no es la primera vez que servidora organiza un evento, ya que ha participado en la creación de un mercado artesanal y en actividades orientadas a la cultura maid. =======================================================
Our goal is participate as entertainers in most of manganime conventions in Spain, marking a milestone because there hasn't been much of that kind of activity on our country.With your help, we will increase our credibility, because a good presence is a big factor, adding that we will become more known due to the promotion of this crowdfunding.We have the support of one of the leaders, who already has experience in the entertainment world and the idol culture and is rather popular. Adding that it isn't the first time that I organize an event, I took part in the making of a craft market and maid culture oriented activities.
Recompensas || Rewards
Sobre las recompensas, una vez que hayamos adquirido los trajes, nos pondremos de inmediato con la sesión de fotos para que recibais vuestras recompensas lo antes posible. En todo caso, mientras se vayan recibiendo las solicitudes, el merchandising que no sean fotografías, será realizado de inmediato para evitar retrasos.Poco a poco iremos actualizando con imágenes del merchandising. 
Ｏ(≧▽≦)Ｏ========================================================About rewards, once we've acquired the costumes, we 
will immediately do a photoshoot so you can receive your rewards as soon
 as possible. As we get applications for rewards, non-photo 
merchandising will be crafted immediately to avoid delays.
Step by step, we'll update with pictures of merchandising. O(≧ ▽ ≦)O
  Riesgos y desafíos || Risks and ChallengesEl mayor riesgo para no conseguir nuestra meta sería no
llegar a recaudar todo el dinero que necesitamos.  Pero realmente, eso no sería una novedad y nosotras no estamos dispuestas a que eso nos sea un impedimento, así que una vez que comience la campaña, todas haremos la mayor promoción posible (ya a raíz de nuestra gran base de popularidad), incluso pidiendo ayuda a las grandes empresas relacionadas con este mundo. Contamos con el gancho del merchandising de las recompensas, algo asequible y que se facilita su envío a todas partes del país e incluso internacional.========================================================There's always the risk that we don't reach the amount of funding we 
need. But really, that wouldn't be a novelty and we aren't going to 
give up because of it. Every one of us will promote the campaign as much
 as possible, even asking large companies for help. We have the hook of 
merchandising rewards, cheap and easy to deliver across Spain and even 
internationally.

<strong>
</strong><p>presents STRANGEr | AJNABIA : a devised performance piece tracking two characters in search
of their identities liberated from their cultures, spanning two languages. The
actors, Mohammed and Elizabeth met in 2012 in Bethlehem, Palestine. One is an
American raised in Texas and living in California who often feels at home in
Palestine. One is a Palestinian living in Cyprus. Both are taking a step back
from their cultural identities to question how much of who they are is merely a
product of their environment, challenging each other’s claims on truth. How
deeply can a Christian American Feminist White actress and an ex-Muslim Atheist
Arab actor access each other? What are our unexamined prejudices?<span>  Does it matter? This piece is an experiment
in leaving cultural identity behind, picking it back up, and seeing what of
value, if anything, remains. </span>STRANGEr will not only confront Elizabeth and Mohammed’s beliefs and
identities but also their friends’ and families’ through conducted interviews,
aiming to create fictional characters from these merged stories. The characters
find themselves stranded on an island and will fall in love only to discover
that the divide between them is as vast as the water that separates them from
their homelands. In the rehearsal room, Elizabeth and Mohammed will begin by
experimenting with dialogue and movement leading themselves through the
exercises of Augusto Boal, Viola Spolin, the Viewpoints, and Wangh’s <i>Acrobat of the Heart</i>. STRANGEr will be
the culmination of a highly personal process that demands the actors to
confront their judgments of themselves and each other in a powerful piece of
theater that beckons audiences to open up in a talk-back about their own
experiences and fears of the Other.<span>  </span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>This project can impact the world, because in times of uncertainty, violence and conflict people are in need of something inspirational.  </li>
<li>The youth need a positive outlet to utilize when they are frustrated or are trying to get away from negative outside influences.</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.memyselfandmime.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Me, Myself and Mime"" </a>offers both spiritual entertainment and inspiration, sharing a unique way of expression to the next generation in hopes to shape the world for the better.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>If funds are not raised we run the risk of other theater companies taking the time slots that are already on hold. which would force dates to change and/or the tour to be potentially put on hold. </li>
<li>We chose a flexible option on Indiegogo, because any little bit will help and if we don't raise all the funds, the funds that we do raise will go toward the production.</li>
<li>if the funds are not raised, <a href=""http://www.memyselfandmime.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Me, Myself and Mime""</a> could potentially only be seen in one city or none at all, which would defeat the purpose of the mission: ""Inspiring the world and sharing the gospel through mime!""</li>
<li>We could also risk missing out on an entire generation of youth that may not see the potential that is possible if only they had been exposed to something like mime dancing  that could appeal to their unique interests and talents. Mime could also allow them to grow and develop the skills and character traits they need to contribute to society in a positive way.</li>
<li>You also risk missing out on witnessing very talented and gifted people who put their heart, mind, body and soul into this craft and deserve a chance to show the world their gift and for you to be ispired as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The plan on solving these challenges is to continue to save as much money out of pocket as possible to cover the expenses. </li>
<li>The first show is set for August 6th in Dallas, TX at the Dallas Performance Arts Hall. If we can make Dallas happen, the next phase would be the snowball effect. Based off of the suceess from Dallas we should be able to cover the expenses for the coming shows until the tour is over. </li>

<div>
<p>I am a choreographer, performer and teacher working within contemporary dance. I currently create work on my company Moxie Brawl and solo work on myself, in addition to accepting commissions and work with other people as an Assistant Choreographer and Movement Director.</p>
<p>Moxie Brawl is a fresh all female inclusive dance theatre company that creates work for outdoors, indoors and places where dance shouldn't be. We are currently supported by Candoco Dance Company, DanceEast, South East Dance, GLYPT and Trinity Laban.</p>
<p>The work I make sits on the perimeter of both theatre and dance. I want to continue to explore both art-forms but be able to push the theatricality of my work much further.  My work has been described as dance meets stand up meets theatre that is able to interact with and draw an audience in without alienating and terrifying them. I enjoy talking about real events but filtering them through an unexpected form. I enjoy combining diverse bodies, a movement language and honest stories. As an artist I am passionate about working with diverse casts. Both my solo practice and my work with Moxie Brawl, reflect my desire to create work that connects with people, that people can experience and engage with.</p>
<p>I have always experimented with British Sign Language (BSL) within my choreography. Working with Mark Smith on my outdoor work <a href=""https://sarahblanc.com/work/sit-back/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Sit Back</i></a>, Nadia Nadarajah on family show <a href=""https://sarahblanc.com/work/windibops/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Windibops</i></a> and now Jemima Hoadley on new group work <i>History Of Ireland</i>. </p>
</div>
<p><u><strong>The Project and Why It's Important to Me</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Over the coming months, I want to explore how I can make my company’s new and existing work accessible to Deaf audiences. My key question to explore is how do I do this in an artistic way that also ensures access? I want to see how I can embed interpretation into my work so its not an ‘add on’ but an exciting artistic possibility</strong>.  </p>
<p>I'm currently creating a new group show, <i>History of Ireland</i>, that is fully accessible to deaf audiences. Unlike in previous processes, we have had a Sign Language Interpreter in the rehearsal process from the outset. I am also wanting to make my solo work accessible; <a href=""https://sarahblanc.com/work/it-started-with-jason-donovan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>I</i></a><i><a href=""https://sarahblanc.com/work/it-started-with-jason-donovan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">t Started with Jason Donovan</a></i><a href=""https://sarahblanc.com/work/it-started-with-jason-donovan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>which already exists without interpretation and a new solo show, <a href=""https://sarahblanc.com/work/my-feminist-boner/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>My Feminist Boner</i></a> which I want to experiment with sign language from the outset.  </p>
<p>This process will not only impact on my own artistic practice but will also enhance the knowledge on how to enhance accessibility within the creative team, which they can take with them to future employment, promoting inclusive practice across the sector.  From previous experience, I believe that building in accessibility enhancing elements to my work will strengthen my inclusive practice as I continue to grow as an artist. I feel both things come hand in hand and essentially it is all part of my artistic practice.</p>
<p>I currently have Jeni Draper working with me on the development of <i>History of Ireland</i> and both solo works as an Access Adviser and Mentor. I also plan to work with deaf and disabled artists, either performing within the work or as Access Advisers.</p>

<p><u><strong>What we need</strong></u></p>
<p>We have been very lucky to receive £26,000 from Arts Council England to support the next development of my company, Moxie Brawl.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Nikoo Mamdoohi, a graduating Directing MFA from UMass Amherst. I'm from Iran and for my thesis I directed a play named Ta'zieh - Between Two Rivers. Ifa Bayeza, award-winning African-American playwright, wrote the play from an English translation into a versed version based on Persian poetic meters.Ta'zieh is a traditional Iranian performance. The theme of all Ta'zieh plays is standing up for what you believe in and speaking truth to power. The story of Ta'zieh performances rotates around the death of Imam Hussein, an iconic Islamic Imam and martyr who died because he did not want to pledge allegiance to the elected governor at the time, early after the prophet’s death in 680 CE. A story that is historic, yet contemporary.</p>
<p>Our production is not a traditional Ta'zieh performance, it is an intercultural performance for today. Between Two Rivers as between the Euphrates and Mississippi. We have created our version, with a woman director, woman playwright and women characters played by women actor, all in a tradition that is solely performed by men. And it is intercultural as we have echoed the African-American cry for justice and invited the contribution of a diverse ensemble as this production has been created through a devised theater process. Our play is comprised of two one hour acts, the first act showing the story of Hurr a soldier who is sent to kill Imam Hussein but upon meeting him, joins on his side and dies defending him. In the second act we see Zeynab, Hussein's sister who has witnessed the unjust death of her brother and his soldiers and when took as a captive to the new governors court, she stands up and speaks to everyone, shedding light on what the truth of the killings were, and by doing this, changing the course of the history to how we know it today. Both of these acts showing activism in face of the governing power, with courage.</p>
<p>After performing this play at UMass, and seeing how this play resonated with the audience -people from very diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, races and religions- I felt strongly that this play should be performed for a larger audience. BU professor Shahla Haeri was our invited guest at our talkback session in UMass. After seeing the play, she was greatly moved and introduced me to the Boston University Iranian Student Organization (BUISO) who then invited us to perform in BU.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This remount, and your contribution in making this happen is extremely important for us, for a multitude of reasons. It gives the students of UMass a rare opportunity to perform what they have passionately created, outside of UMass and for a bigger audience. It is a great opportunity for the students of BU to see a play, be exposed and get immersed in stories and arts of another culture, in an intercultural experience. Apart from these, this performance is doubly special because it is done on the actual Ashura day, the 10th day of Muharram, on the day of the martyrdom of Hossein. All around the world, muslims commemorate his death on this day, and in Iran many Ta’zieh performances will happen. We are joining all on this day, and bringing the Muslim and Iranian community of Boston a rare chance of attending a Ta’zieh performance on Ashura.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money we raise will help us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for an accessible venue that will allow us to bring our message of peace to Boston</li>
<li>Transport and accommodate our hard-working cast and crew, as well as our set and props</li>
<li>Ensure Vaahe is able to continue to create important and meaningful stories that promote unity and love. As a contributor, you become a part of the spreading of that message</li>

<p><span style=""font-style: normal;""><b>About ""La Dottoressa"" </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">""La Dottoressa"" is a new musical about the legendary educator, feminist and advocate for World Peace, Maria Montessori, one of the first woman doctors in Italy whose teaching methods changed the world.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The musical, set at the end of the 19th century, begins with Montessori's seemingly insurmountable challenges in becoming a woman doctor in Italy at a time when most professions, especially medicine, were exclusively male-dominated.

</div></div>","About ""La Dottoressa"" 
""La Dottoressa"" is a new musical about the legendary educator, feminist and advocate for World Peace, Maria Montessori, one of the first woman doctors in Italy whose teaching methods changed the world.
The musical, set at the end of the 19th century, begins with Montessori's seemingly insurmountable challenges in becoming a woman doctor in Italy at a time when most professions, especially medicine, were exclusively male-dominated. This did not phase Maria, who took her plight directly to Pope Leo XIII and persuaded him to write a letter on her behalf, to open those tightly shut doors.
The emotional heart of ""La Dottoressa"" centers around Maria's relationship with her young son, Mario, whom she gave birth to out of wedlock. Faced with the impossible choice to either send her newborn child to distant relatives or be forced to give up her career and destiny amid scandal, Maria chose to remain as a ""special aunt"" to  her young Mario.  As he grew older, he instinctively knew who this special visitor was... and yearned to be with her.  Their ultimate reunion is tender and profound... echoing the painful decisions we all  make in our lives.

A new musical in two acts
Book by Mark Mc Quown
Music and Lyrics by Buddy Mix

         In the city of Transylvania, Romania, is the tourist attraction of Bran Castle which is rumored and reported to be Dracula’s Castle.  Living in the castle today is a coven of vampires whose head is called Dragula and they live off of the stray tourist who gets lost now and then in the castle walls.

         Jordan and Melissa are a young to middle age couple, about to be married and on their pre honey moon visiting Bran Castle but what they really want to do is spend the night in Dracula’s bed.  The couple hides from the tour and before the tour leaves for the day they find themselves in Dracula’s Bedroom facing Dragula, dressed as a Security Guard.

        Dragula discovers that Jordan studies bats for a living and tells Jordan and Melissa that they may return that evening and be part of a dinner party for other members of a society who also study bats.  Jordan and Melissa leave with the tour but return that evening by taxi and are ushered into the bedroom, now a dining room, and unbeknownst to them – they are on the menu.

        At the end of act one, Jordan and Melissa have discovered that they are in a coven of vampires and try everything to escape but Dragula, unwittingly falls in love with Jordan and spares their lives until Dragula is forced to bite Melissa who then, for a brief period, turns into the Queen of the coven and Dragula loses his powers and is restored to human form. 

       Act two brings Jordan and Dragula together to fight the menacing Melissa and Jordan slowly feeling like he is falling in love with a man.  In that moment, Melissa is struck by a silver arrow from a bow gun and returns to her human form and now Dragula, Melissa and Jordan are all running from the coven.  The coven finally corners them all and one of them bites Dragula who immediately returns to his former stature and the ruler of this coven and this castle.

       Dragula realizes how impossible it is for him to fall in love with a human and also how much he misses his lost humanity.  He hypnotizes Jordan and Melissa so they won’t remember what happened and he sends them back to America to enjoy their lives and American television.  He then sends coven members out seeking fresh blood but only gets an apple in return as he retires again for a long night’s sleep in Bran Castle, Transylvania, Romania.

        This is an incredible story with great music and we are undertaking a staged reading, dance and singing presentation of this new show in order to find a home and a continuing life for the production.  Any donation you make will go directly to the production of ""Dragula"" on October 2, 3, at 7:30 pm to 9:15 pm in The Complex Theaters on Santa Monica Blvd, in Hollywood in The Ruby Theater.  Tickets are $20.00 and the Ruby Theatre only holds 55 people so if you also wanted to see it, buy your tickets early, they go on sale in mid August according to the Los Angeles Theater Festival.

We are committed to creating accessible, thought-provoking, and fun performance experiences that general audiences will  enjoy as much as dance enthusiasts. Inspired by modern dance icons-and-sometimes-social-activists like Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Katherine Dunham, Jose Limon, Alvin Ailey, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp and Doug Varone, we  believe in the power of dance to move, to motivate, to challenge, and to spark charge. We have been  mentioned in Philadelphia Weekly for our “dynamism and trademark accessibility” and “provocative staging,” and our work has been described in Campus Philly as “sure to provoke an emotional response.” We are ready to keep modern dance relevant in today's society - but we need your help to do so! </p>
<p>We are in the process of creating our <b>third Philaldephia FringeArts concert</b> - a follow up to last year's SOLD OUT performance. <i><b>Structurally Sound </b></i>is a collaborative evening length work set to 100% live music by <b>The Radical Sound</b>, including a world-premiere commission by composer <b>Tomek Regulski</b>. Original movement created by choreographers <b>Krista Armbruster </b>and <b>Shannon Dooling </b>in collaboration with a cast of ten dancers will take place in a custom-built set piece. This dynamic performance experience begs the question  <b>""Just what are we made of - and how stable is, anyway?""</b></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Here's more information on the production Bad Manners at the Dinner Table!</p>
<p><u><i>The Writer: </i></u></p>
<p>Renee Necole  - New to the game for sure, but making her mark nonetheless! Play write, poet &amp; visionary, Renee Necole lives to create out of the box revelations for the present day church; relaying the bold and uncut reality of the spiritual realm, fleshly conflict and mental awareness of them both.</p>
<p>Renee Necole is not ashamed to say that her visionary works didn’t start in the Christian handbook of holy. She toured the world from 2001 until 2010 with a burlesque poetry ensemble; until she heard the call of God and dedicated her life and her talents to Christ. Renee Necole has been writing poetry, plays, skits and small productions since she can remember; but put her plan into action for the Lord in 2009. Since then she has created such memorizing skits as ""Out of the Box"" and ""Unveiled""; a stage play dedicated to our female ancestors, which has starred Gospel legend Shirley Murdock.</p>
<p>Renee Necole is currently working on a series of Theater Productions including “Bad Manners at the Dinner Table” as well as a new production coming to a venue near you next spring entitled “Sticks &amp; Stones"" a drama filled stage production with twist and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. No doubt, her works are truly compelling! Her productions, poetry and skits are all written on a personal level to connect with the community and especially broken women.</p>
<p>Renee Necole has written, co-produced, casted &amp; co-casted a body of work which includes: Ladies Room with DNR Productions, A House Full of Secrets with William Alexander Productions, Stuck with Jesonda Productions, Be A Lion with Brand New Sheriff Productions and Ferguson the Musical with Pechanda Dubose.</p>
<p>She is the Owner and Creative Director of Cast Me Not Full Service Agency where her model stands as ""Providing Provision for Your Vision. A full service company that provides assistance with casting, directing, procurement, event planning and script consulting of films, theater and promotional events. When she’s not writing, Renee Necole is giving to the community with her charity “A.C.T.S” (Acts of Compassion Thespian Society) which provides volunteers for community events; associated with actors who are compelled to help in acts of humanity.</p>
<p>Mother of 2, Israel and Isaiah and wife of Brian Stringfield, her life is busy; but the call that God has placed on her life keeps her feet moving in the footsteps of her destiny. Keep your eye out for this playwright, author, poet and activist!</p>
<p><i><u>About Bad Manners &amp; it's Importance:</u></i></p>
<p>Denise lived an exciting life full of drama, excitement and inevitably misfortune. Ride along with Denise as she explains the ups and downs that landed her in the lowest place ever. Denise pleads with the audience to help her solve the age old tale of ""who done it"" as she quest to find the sin who waged her death. Meet Denise’s sins as they round table to discover who the culprit is. Listen to the pleas from Greed, Envy, Lust, Sloth, Wrath, Pride and Gluttony as they try to convince the audience that they are innocent. This is an interactive stage play that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats and brings some of their very own truths to light when they find out what happens when you invite your sins to dinner.</p>
<p><u><i>Why this production is important: </i></u></p>
<p>Renee Necole created P31 Productions to open the door for true to life stage productions that hit home for the Christian community and those they are trying to reach. She wanted to embody true ministry through arts while bringing soul stirring, realty based stage productions with comedic flair and audience interaction. Bad Manners at the Dinner Table is just that! While entertaining and not strictly bible belt material, Bad Manners at the Dinner Table touches on many variables to everyday life in combination with the seven deadly sins that touch us daily (Greed, Envy, Gluttony, Pride, Sloth, Wrath &amp; Lust). While humorous, the truth shines through revealing our inner most secrets and demanding us to face our reality.</p>
<p><u><i>Providing Provision for the Vision: </i></u></p>

Here's more information on the production Bad Manners at the Dinner Table!
The Writer: 
Renee Necole  - New to the game for sure, but making her mark nonetheless! Play write, poet & visionary, Renee Necole lives to create out of the box revelations for the present day church; relaying the bold and uncut reality of the spiritual realm, fleshly conflict and mental awareness of them both.
Renee Necole is not ashamed to say that her visionary works didn’t start in the Christian handbook of holy. She toured the world from 2001 until 2010 with a burlesque poetry ensemble; until she heard the call of God and dedicated her life and her talents to Christ. Renee Necole has been writing poetry, plays, skits and small productions since she can remember; but put her plan into action for the Lord in 2009. Since then she has created such memorizing skits as ""Out of the Box"" and ""Unveiled""; a stage play dedicated to our female ancestors, which has starred Gospel legend Shirley Murdock.
Renee Necole is currently working on a series of Theater Productions including “Bad Manners at the Dinner Table” as well as a new production coming to a venue near you next spring entitled “Sticks & Stones"" a drama filled stage production with twist and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. No doubt, her works are truly compelling! Her productions, poetry and skits are all written on a personal level to connect with the community and especially broken women.
Renee Necole has written, co-produced, casted & co-casted a body of work which includes: Ladies Room with DNR Productions, A House Full of Secrets with William Alexander Productions, Stuck with Jesonda Productions, Be A Lion with Brand New Sheriff Productions and Ferguson the Musical with Pechanda Dubose.
She is the Owner and Creative Director of Cast Me Not Full Service Agency where her model stands as ""Providing Provision for Your Vision. A full service company that provides assistance with casting, directing, procurement, event planning and script consulting of films, theater and promotional events. When she’s not writing, Renee Necole is giving to the community with her charity “A.C.T.S” (Acts of Compassion Thespian Society) which provides volunteers for community events; associated with actors who are compelled to help in acts of humanity.
Mother of 2, Israel and Isaiah and wife of Brian Stringfield, her life is busy; but the call that God has placed on her life keeps her feet moving in the footsteps of her destiny. Keep your eye out for this playwright, author, poet and activist!
About Bad Manners & it's Importance:
Denise lived an exciting life full of drama, excitement and inevitably misfortune. Ride along with Denise as she explains the ups and downs that landed her in the lowest place ever. Denise pleads with the audience to help her solve the age old tale of ""who done it"" as she quest to find the sin who waged her death. Meet Denise’s sins as they round table to discover who the culprit is. Listen to the pleas from Greed, Envy, Lust, Sloth, Wrath, Pride and Gluttony as they try to convince the audience that they are innocent. This is an interactive stage play that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats and brings some of their very own truths to light when they find out what happens when you invite your sins to dinner.
Why this production is important: 
Renee Necole created P31 Productions to open the door for true to life stage productions that hit home for the Christian community and those they are trying to reach. She wanted to embody true ministry through arts while bringing soul stirring, realty based stage productions with comedic flair and audience interaction. Bad Manners at the Dinner Table is just that! While entertaining and not strictly bible belt material, Bad Manners at the Dinner Table touches on many variables to everyday life in combination with the seven deadly sins that touch us daily (Greed, Envy, Gluttony, Pride, Sloth, Wrath & Lust). While humorous, the truth shines through revealing our inner most secrets and demanding us to face our reality.

<h3>As Is at Bedlam Theatre, 2015</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Mice
On A Beam is a not-for-profit business partnership working to challenge,
educate and entertain audiences through the medium of excellent theatre. We
believe good art is inescapably valuable to provide information without being
aggressive or forcing a political agenda, to provoke and stimulate discussion, creating
a safe space to start not being afraid of the big issues anymore – and we are
going to support our audiences to come with us on that journey.</p>
This
year we are taking our first full-length show, As Is by William M. Hoffman, to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. <i>As Is</i> was one of the first plays to stand up and talk about the AIDS crisis and its devastating impact on the people of New York City. In its 30th anniversary year, Mice On A Beam Theatre Company transports 1980s New York to the Edinburgh Fringe.</div><div>This play is so important to us because it tells the story of the politics and crisis of AIDS in the US in the 1980s - but that's not all it is. It's a human story, about a community of interlinked people and the impact of the crisis on them, and how to build an unconventional family around you in difficult times. Most importantly, it's a story about love - and how to love someone 'as is', whatever's going on, whoever they are.</div><div>
<h3>As it is, as it was... about the play</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>I was at
the gym soaking in the hot tub when I first heard about AIDS. It was how many
years ago now? My friend Brian - remember him? - was soaking, too, and he told
me about a mutual friend who had died the week before. It was
""bizarre"" he said. Brian died last week of the same thing. And he and
I once soaked in the same hot tub, making a kind of human soup...</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>New York, 1985. Rich, a writer who is
beginning to find success, is breaking up with Saul, his long-time partner.
However, his idyll with his new lover is short-lived when Rich is diagnosed
with AIDS and turns back to Saul for sanctuary.</p>
<p>Greenwich Village was the centre
for movements that have challenged the wider American culture and the
cradle of the modern LGBT movement (as well as the original site for the
Off-Off-Broadway Theatre movement and a rejection of commercial theatre!). <i>As Is</i> brings it rekindles 1980’s Village
life to life in Edinburgh this year, through lights, textures, graffiti and a
vibrant 80s soundtrack. Prejudice and injustice, ignorance, compassion and
understanding are played out in a sparkling and rhythmic tapestry, confronting
us with the stark realities of Rich’s life and the people around him. Packed
with determination in the face of adversity, the ensemble cast <span>highlight the immediacy of a time in which a whole
community feared for its life.</span></p>
<p>Ground-breaking when it premiered, <i>As Is</i> remains an honest, unsparing and
sharply funny examination of sexuality, death, and what it means to love
someone for now, for the moment, for always, in sickness and in health – as is.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We are thrilled
to be paying our team for <i>As Is</i>
national minimum wage, plus profit share up to Equity/ITC minimum. But with
a cast of eight, plus a stage manager, director, producer, designers... it adds up. Factor in audiovisual costs, set, props, costume,
box office guarantees, royalties, accommodation and travel, marketing and
publicity costs, rehearsal space and we are looking to raise at least £35,000
to be able to get our show up and running.</p>
<p>We need your help - in fact, we can't do this without you. Every contribution will go straight towards the show, from set building to costumes to rehearsal space hire to fees for our amazing team to that Barcelona chair they keep talking about.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
need your help to act as ambassadors of our mission, and to donate towards
making this work happen. Cuts are ravaging the creative heart of the arts
industry. The best way to fight back is to have the courage and ambition to
keep practicing, and ethically – but your financial reinforcement is the only
way to progress this.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Make
a gift towards <i>As Is</i> and let us bring you closer to our work in a number of ways. We'd also like to offer some special <i>As Is</i> souvenirs - let us know what you'd like and we'll see if we can make it happen!</p>
<p>We
are also happy to discuss more personalised approaches to acknowledge the
incredible support of a leadership gift for more information on this please contact milla@miceonabeam.co.uk.</p>
<p>Just
to give you some context:</p>
<p><b>£10 could pay for an hour of rehearsal
space hire</b></p>
<p><b>£60 could get one of our actors to
Edinburgh</b></p>
<p><b>£100 could get our set to Edinburgh</b></p>
<p><b>£300 could mean we have publicity
materials for the show</b></p>
<p><b>£600 could pay for our set</b></p>
<p><b>£1,000 could pay an actor’s fee at
National Minimum Wage</b></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>We want
HIV/AIDS back on the agenda - and we want it coming from a place of love and understanding.</b></p>
<p>We want to use our show to create a new discussion platform through the arts. Arts and information work well together, to be provocative, raise difficult issues in a way that's more accessible than a public information talk, and stimulate discussion. To achieve this, we need to make powerful and beautiful art, with a real story at its heart - and we believe <i>As Is</i> is the way to do it.</p>
<p>Live storytelling has always been the most powerful tool for people to broach subjects difficult to fully understand or talk about. We want people to leave this play talking about HIV/AIDS - not in fear, but wanting to find out more.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone can contribute financially - but you can still support the show!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As our aim is that people will

Mice
On A Beam is a not-for-profit business partnership working to challenge,
educate and entertain audiences through the medium of excellent theatre. We
believe good art is inescapably valuable to provide information without being
aggressive or forcing a political agenda, to provoke and stimulate discussion, creating
a safe space to start not being afraid of the big issues anymore – and we are
going to support our audiences to come with us on that journey.
This
year we are taking our first full-length show, As Is by William M. Hoffman, to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. As Is was one of the first plays to stand up and talk about the AIDS crisis and its devastating impact on the people of New York City. In its 30th anniversary year, Mice On A Beam Theatre Company transports 1980s New York to the Edinburgh Fringe.This play is so important to us because it tells the story of the politics and crisis of AIDS in the US in the 1980s - but that's not all it is. It's a human story, about a community of interlinked people and the impact of the crisis on them, and how to build an unconventional family around you in difficult times. Most importantly, it's a story about love - and how to love someone 'as is', whatever's going on, whoever they are.
As it is, as it was... about the play 
I was at
the gym soaking in the hot tub when I first heard about AIDS. It was how many
years ago now? My friend Brian - remember him? - was soaking, too, and he told
me about a mutual friend who had died the week before. It was
""bizarre"" he said. Brian died last week of the same thing. And he and
I once soaked in the same hot tub, making a kind of human soup...

New York, 1985. Rich, a writer who is
beginning to find success, is breaking up with Saul, his long-time partner.
However, his idyll with his new lover is short-lived when Rich is diagnosed
with AIDS and turns back to Saul for sanctuary.
Greenwich Village was the centre
for movements that have challenged the wider American culture and the
cradle of the modern LGBT movement (as well as the original site for the
Off-Off-Broadway Theatre movement and a rejection of commercial theatre!). As Is brings it rekindles 1980’s Village
life to life in Edinburgh this year, through lights, textures, graffiti and a
vibrant 80s soundtrack. Prejudice and injustice, ignorance, compassion and
understanding are played out in a sparkling and rhythmic tapestry, confronting
us with the stark realities of Rich’s life and the people around him. Packed
with determination in the face of adversity, the ensemble cast highlight the immediacy of a time in which a whole
community feared for its life.
Ground-breaking when it premiered, As Is remains an honest, unsparing and
sharply funny examination of sexuality, death, and what it means to love
someone for now, for the moment, for always, in sickness and in health – as is.
   What We Need & What You Get 

We are thrilled
to be paying our team for As Is
national minimum wage, plus profit share up to Equity/ITC minimum. But with
a cast of eight, plus a stage manager, director, producer, designers... it adds up. Factor in audiovisual costs, set, props, costume,
box office guarantees, royalties, accommodation and travel, marketing and
publicity costs, rehearsal space and we are looking to raise at least £35,000
to be able to get our show up and running.
We need your help - in fact, we can't do this without you. Every contribution will go straight towards the show, from set building to costumes to rehearsal space hire to fees for our amazing team to that Barcelona chair they keep talking about.


We
need your help to act as ambassadors of our mission, and to donate towards
making this work happen. Cuts are ravaging the creative heart of the arts
industry. The best way to fight back is to have the courage and ambition to
keep practicing, and ethically – but your financial reinforcement is the only
way to progress this.


Make
a gift towards As Is and let us bring you closer to our work in a number of ways. We'd also like to offer some special As Is souvenirs - let us know what you'd like and we'll see if we can make it happen!
We
are also happy to discuss more personalised approaches to acknowledge the
incredible support of a leadership gift for more information on this please contact milla@miceonabeam.co.uk.
Just
to give you some context:
£10 could pay for an hour of rehearsal
space hire
£60 could get one of our actors to
Edinburgh
£100 could get our set to Edinburgh
£300 could mean we have publicity
materials for the show
£600 could pay for our set
£1,000 could pay an actor’s fee at
National Minimum Wage   The Impact 
We want
HIV/AIDS back on the agenda - and we want it coming from a place of love and understanding.
We want to use our show to create a new discussion platform through the arts. Arts and information work well together, to be provocative, raise difficult issues in a way that's more accessible than a public information talk, and stimulate discussion. To achieve this, we need to make powerful and beautiful art, with a real story at its heart - and we believe As Is is the way to do it.
Live storytelling has always been the most powerful tool for people to broach subjects difficult to fully understand or talk about. We want people to leave this play talking about HIV/AIDS - not in fear, but wanting to find out more.

    Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone can contribute financially - but you can still support the show!


As our aim is that people will
leave this play wanting to talk and find out more about HIV/AIDS, we want to
complement this with outreach work and collaboration with other organisations. We are seeking sponsors to be able to provide free condoms, information
materials, and HIV home testing kits for our audience members, and for them to
be able to distribute further afield should they wish to. 
If you can help with any of the above, or organising an event, or just spreading the word about our campaign and our show, your contribution will really help us!

</div><p><b>Short Summary</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;""> </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p>During a recent photography workshop in Cuba, I attempted to capture the unique images and vibrant colors of this wonderful culture. The photographer’s “usual suspects” included the Malécon overlooking Havana harbor, the stalled-in-time automobiles, and the extraordinary architecture. These served up daily feasts for the eyes and the lens, but the unexpected highlight of my trip (and the purpose of this appeal) is best represented in this image: a tattered ballet slipper worn by an extraordinary young dancer.</p><p>The youth rehearsals of ProDanza, Havana’s 460-member ballet academy, are as breathtaking as any other vista in Cuba. Music and dance are Havana’s primary cultural expression and I came away from my trip determined to honor this cultural jewel and unconditional artistic gener<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">osity in a tangible way. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p><p>The young members of ProDanza sorely (literally and figuratively) need the kinds of basics that dancers elsewhere take for granted. Watching these beautiful young artists practice their craft in such distressed equipment- or with no support whatsoever- galvanized me.  Please read this inspiring story to learn more about the situation at ProDanza.</p><p><a href=""http://www.worldartstoday.com/dance/dancing-dreams-thrive-at-pro-danza/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.worldartstoday.com/dance/dancing-dre...</a><br/></p>
<p>As Cuba begins to reconnect with the outside world. the gift of proper pointe shoes would speak volumes about our hopes for the school’s future, and for our support of the arts in its country.</p>
<p>Currently, the best way to get supplies to these dancers is hand-carried in travelers’ luggage. I have found a great partner in Malia Everette of AltruVistas, who sends many travelers to Cuba each month, who are each able to take a couple of pairs of shoes in their luggage.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary During a recent photography workshop in Cuba, I attempted to capture the unique images and vibrant colors of this wonderful culture. The photographer’s “usual suspects” included the Malécon overlooking Havana harbor, the stalled-in-time automobiles, and the extraordinary architecture. These served up daily feasts for the eyes and the lens, but the unexpected highlight of my trip (and the purpose of this appeal) is best represented in this image: a tattered ballet slipper worn by an extraordinary young dancer.The youth rehearsals of ProDanza, Havana’s 460-member ballet academy, are as breathtaking as any other vista in Cuba. Music and dance are Havana’s primary cultural expression and I came away from my trip determined to honor this cultural jewel and unconditional artistic generosity in a tangible way.   
The young members of ProDanza sorely (literally and figuratively) need the kinds of basics that dancers elsewhere take for granted. Watching these beautiful young artists practice their craft in such distressed equipment- or with no support whatsoever- galvanized me.  Please read this inspiring story to learn more about the situation at ProDanza.http://www.worldartstoday.com/dance/dancing-dre...
As Cuba begins to reconnect with the outside world. the gift of proper pointe shoes would speak volumes about our hopes for the school’s future, and for our support of the arts in its country.
Currently, the best way to get supplies to these dancers is hand-carried in travelers’ luggage. I have found a great partner in Malia Everette of AltruVistas, who sends many travelers to Cuba each month, who are each able to take a couple of pairs of shoes in their luggage.
By contributing to this campaign, you will allow these young dancers to pursue their dreams. Some Cuban ballet dancers have become members of American and international ballet companies.  Some examples are Alicia Alonso, Jose Manuel Carreño, Lorena and Lorna Feijoo, Julio Arozarena, Vladimir Alvarez, Alahydee Carreño and Xiomara Reyes. After retiring, Cuban dancers have even founded American Ballet Schools.

</div><div> <p>We need $5,000 dollars (flexible) to make this production as historically accurate and high quality as possible.

</div></div>","The beloved 1975 musical ""A Chorus Line"" (Music by Marvin Hamlisch, Lyrics by Edward Kleban, Book by James Kirkwood Jr, and Nicholas Dante) turned 40 in 2015!  We are celebrating the 9 time Tony Award winning musical with a fresh adaptation directed by Tom Rowan this coming February at The Secret Theatre in Long Island City!  In order for this record breaking musical to have a New York production once again, we need funds to make the jazz hands happen! 
Why do a funding campaign?
 We need $5,000 dollars (flexible) to make this production as historically accurate and high quality as possible. Unfortunately the facts of life for an off off Broadway production at a off off house are that its extremely difficult to finance and guarantee a profit. Equity rules restrict us to $18 top ticket price so even if we sell out a lot of nights it will be a very close shave between losing, breaking even or making [a little] money. 
You get to invest in a spectacular production directed by an official A Chorus Line expert and author on the subject and one of the fabulous perks listed in our perks section!

<p><b><i>Family Archive</i> </b><b>by Ann Marie Shea</b></p>
<p>Ginny, a successful family practice lawyer, and her beloved younger sister, Molly, are at odds as to how to handle the physical detritus cluttering their late mother’s house.

</p><p><b><i>Fiancé(e)</i> </b><b>by Siobhan O’Hara</b></p>
<p>This play follows the story of Daniel and Rebecca, two people who are both eager to spend the rest of their lives together but not before hitting a few bumps. When confronted with his girlfriend's proposal of marriage in front of his friends and family during Thanksgiving, Daniel's manhood is threatened, causing a riff in the young couples love life and putting a strain on the family dinner.

<h2>Helluva WHY?</h2>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>Out of the 40 plays Luigi Pirandello wrote, most can only name a few, with the most popular being: ""Six Characters in Search of an Author""</p>
<p></p>The production of <em>Six Characters</em> in Paris in 1923 made Pirandello widely known, and his work became one of the central influences on the French theatre. French drama from the existentialistic pessimism of Jean Anouilh and Jean-Paul Sartre to the absurdist comedy of Eugène Ionesco and Samuel Beckett is tinged with what is called “Pirandellianism.” His work has been acknowledged as a major influence by such accomplished playwrights as Harold Pinter and Edward Albee. His <span style=""background-color: initial;"">influence can even be seen in the religious verse dramas of T.S. Eliot.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>Pirandello's work is still widely produced in Europe but a major Pirandello work has not been seen on the Broadway stage for 42 years!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It's baffling. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Luigi Pirandello wrote great plays, with great characters that are constantly changing,
both in their eyes and our own. Pirandello's plays are fascinating and challenging -- and
many are genuinely funny. Laugh out loud FUNNY!</span><br/></p>
<div><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Today, traditional social and gender roles are changing. These changes are attuned to
Pirandello’s theme of truth vs. illusion. In the words of the prominent critic, playwright, and
scholar Robert Brustein, “The basic Pirandellian conflict is internal – between the mask one
shows to the world and the actual face of the suffering individual. The truth of one’s
character must remain forever concealed if one is to survive in society.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
</div></div>We think it is the right time to bring new audiences to Pirandello and re-establish his position in the evolution of the dramatic arts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Helluva WHEN?</h2>

<p><b>2017 </b>is a Milestone Anniversary! It marks 150 years since the birth of Luigi Pirandello.</p>

Helluva WHAT?

Pirandello150 is a year-long festival commemorating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Luigi Pirandello.It will bring 14 one-act plays, five major productions, a film program, panel discussions and academic seminars to New York City beginning in January 2017.Luigi Pirandello (1867-1936) was an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet and short story writer. He has written over 40 plays and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for ""his almost magical power to turn psychological analysis into good theatre."" Pirandello's tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd as his work explores the boundaries between reality and illusion. With his invention of the “theater within the theater,” Luigi Pirandello became an important innovator in modern drama. Not only did Pirandello alter the face of theatre forever through his plays, but he also instilled discipline in his actors and placed special emphasis on their work as an ensemble, a radical notion at the time.

The more people we talk to about Pirandello150 (www.pirandello150.org) the more interest it has generated and suddenly we seem to have one Helluva Advisory Board...

Helluva WHY?


Out of the 40 plays Luigi Pirandello wrote, most can only name a few, with the most popular being: ""Six Characters in Search of an Author""
The production of Six Characters in Paris in 1923 made Pirandello widely known, and his work became one of the central influences on the French theatre. French drama from the existentialistic pessimism of Jean Anouilh and Jean-Paul Sartre to the absurdist comedy of Eugène Ionesco and Samuel Beckett is tinged with what is called “Pirandellianism.” His work has been acknowledged as a major influence by such accomplished playwrights as Harold Pinter and Edward Albee. His influence can even be seen in the religious verse dramas of T.S. Eliot.


Pirandello's work is still widely produced in Europe but a major Pirandello work has not been seen on the Broadway stage for 42 years!


It's baffling. 
Luigi Pirandello wrote great plays, with great characters that are constantly changing,
both in their eyes and our own. Pirandello's plays are fascinating and challenging -- and
many are genuinely funny. Laugh out loud FUNNY!

Today, traditional social and gender roles are changing. These changes are attuned to
Pirandello’s theme of truth vs. illusion. In the words of the prominent critic, playwright, and
scholar Robert Brustein, “The basic Pirandellian conflict is internal – between the mask one
shows to the world and the actual face of the suffering individual. The truth of one’s
character must remain forever concealed if one is to survive in society.”

We think it is the right time to bring new audiences to Pirandello and re-establish his position in the evolution of the dramatic arts. 



Helluva WHEN?

2017 is a Milestone Anniversary! It marks 150 years since the birth of Luigi Pirandello.
2017 will be marked the high point for a cultural relaunch of interest and awareness in Pirandello.
Projected 2017 Timeline

~January
The Film Forum Pirandello Series highlighted by a restoration showing of “Kaos” by the Taviani Brothers.
~February
The One-Act series kicks off. We will present all 14 of the known one-act plays by Pirandello, in four separate programs with different casts, directors, and in different venues and involving different Off and Off-Off Broadway companies throughout the city.



~March
The Living Theatre revival of their landmark production of “Tonight We Improvise”
~April/May
Productions #1 & #2 open*

~Wednesday, June 28
A Gala celebrating the 150th Birthday of Luigi Pirandello for the benefit of all the sponsoring and participating companies/societies of Pirandello150.
~Fall
Productions #3 & #4 open*
*In addition to The Living Theatre production of “Tonight We Improvise” the plays that are currently under consideration are: 
“Six Characters in Search of an Author”, “Right You Are (If You Think You Are)”, “Enrico IV”, “The Rules of the Game”, “As You Desire Me”, “Each in His Own Way"", and “Liola”
Productions will be scheduled subject to the availability of actors, directors, theaters and, of course, financing. We hope that at least one of these plays will be given a Broadway production!

Most of our selection of full-length and one-act plays will be in recent or new translations.


~Throughout the year
We also plan:


A series of lectures and panel discussions on all aspects of Pirandello’s life, work and influence;

Readings of as many of the full-length plays as possible that are not being given full productions;
Podcasts of noted actors, writers and other individuals reading selected short stories, plays and segments of novels that will be available on our website at www.pirandello150.org starting from this Fall, 2016.
An outreach to high schools and colleges in the tri-state area through academic conferences, lectures and workshops. 



Helluva WHERE?

New York City!

As the preeminent city for the American theater, New York is the perfect center for the Pirandello150 festival. Italian government and cultural institutions are active in New York’s cultural life. Major Italian corporations have important and growing operation centers. Educational institutions focus on Italian art, history, language and design, while enthusiasm about Italian cuisine grows ever more popular. 


We would like to start introducing Pirandello150 in NYC this year, 2016, with two very exciting events that are also featured in our fundraising perks...
(1). A Pirandello Potpourri 
At 6:00pm on Tuesday, June 28, we will celebrate Luigi Pirandello's 149th birthday with a ""Pirandello Potpourri"": a special ""kick-off"" event to officially and publicly announce Pirandello150. The Italian Cultural Institute has generously donated their lovely meeting room where we will present a short program of readings and remarks that will preview our plans for 2017. This will be followed by a reception.

<p><b>Into Some Woods</b></p>
<p><i>Into the Woods</i> is a musical with book by James Lapine and music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and it's going up at Bard College! <i>Into the Woods </i>combines several fairy tales, such as those of Cinderella, Jack (and the Beanstalk), Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood... and a very important cow. Along with an original story of the Baker and the Baker's Wife, these characters meet and interact in the woods, until they get what they're searching for. And once that happens, everything goes to pieces. Overall, it is a show about wishes, family, and growing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What It Will Look Like:</b></p>
<p><i>Into the Woods</i> is already not your typical fairytale. And this is not your typical version of <i>Into the Woods</i>. To begin with, we have an 11 person cast for a 21 character lineup, which means that more than half of the cast is playing more than one character. Because of that, each actor will have a base costume, and will add on other pieces for each character. The costumes are detailed, with each actor having about four separate pieces for each base costume. This is also a prop-heavy show, with upwards of twenty props needed. The set is fairly minimal, and will take advantage of black box theater we will be in. It basically comes down to props and costumes for the visuals of the show.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What We Need:</b></p>
<p>All funding will be going into this show. We will be using donated money for every aspect of the show: costumes, set, lighting, sound, makeup, and props. Our project has support from the Bard Musical Theatre Club, but all of that money went into obtaining the rights for the show.

<p>The first presentation of the show took place at the Fringe Festival San Miguel de Allende (<a href=""http://fringesanmiguel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fringesanmiguel.com</a>) Mexico, in March 2016, at The Skot Foreman Gallery (<a href=""http://www.skotforeman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.skotforeman.com</a>) - to a terrific response.   </p>
<p>Three actors brought eleven poems by the Spanish poet, Federico Garcia Lorca to life, with projections of both the eleven Terry Frost etchings (created in response to these favorite poems of his), and the poetry text in Spanish and English.  Stories and musings on Sir Terry and Lorca, and their work, were woven between the poems. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Skot Foreman gallery also housed an exhibition of all the etchings, making it a wonderful  collaboration of an art exhibition and performance.  (""A new and exciting way of experiencing visual art"", Skot Foreman said).</p>
<p><b>HOW THE SHOW WAS BORN..</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Janet Prince, one of the actors,  had a ""Frost &amp; Lorca""  portfolio rather languishing in a cupboard.  She showed the portfolio  to her friend who started reading the Lorca poems in Spanish.  A memory occurred to Janet - Terry Frost had always wanted to create a theatre set.  What if this entire portfolio could be ""brought to life""?     Janet knew that Fringe San Miguel theatre festival (<a href=""http://fringesanmiguel.com)%C2%A0were"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fringesanmiguel.com</a>) were always in pursuit of bilingual work, having been a part of the festival with her one woman show in 2015.   Frost &amp; Lorca seemed like the perfect piece to present to them... <b> </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>John Morrow and Kate Lowenstein, founders and directors of the Fringe SMA, jumped at the submission of this idea, and just a few weeks later, brought the good news that a British sponsor (who owned two Terry Frost paintings!) wanted to support the first ""presentation"" at Fringe San Miguel, 2016.  </p>

The first presentation of the show took place at the Fringe Festival San Miguel de Allende (http://fringesanmiguel.com) Mexico, in March 2016, at The Skot Foreman Gallery (http://www.skotforeman.com) - to a terrific response.   
Three actors brought eleven poems by the Spanish poet, Federico Garcia Lorca to life, with projections of both the eleven Terry Frost etchings (created in response to these favorite poems of his), and the poetry text in Spanish and English.  Stories and musings on Sir Terry and Lorca, and their work, were woven between the poems. 


The Skot Foreman gallery also housed an exhibition of all the etchings, making it a wonderful  collaboration of an art exhibition and performance.  (""A new and exciting way of experiencing visual art"", Skot Foreman said).
HOW THE SHOW WAS BORN...

Janet Prince, one of the actors,  had a ""Frost & Lorca""  portfolio rather languishing in a cupboard.  She showed the portfolio  to her friend who started reading the Lorca poems in Spanish.  A memory occurred to Janet - Terry Frost had always wanted to create a theatre set.  What if this entire portfolio could be ""brought to life""?     Janet knew that Fringe San Miguel theatre festival (http://fringesanmiguel.com) were always in pursuit of bilingual work, having been a part of the festival with her one woman show in 2015.   Frost & Lorca seemed like the perfect piece to present to them...  


John Morrow and Kate Lowenstein, founders and directors of the Fringe SMA, jumped at the submission of this idea, and just a few weeks later, brought the good news that a British sponsor (who owned two Terry Frost paintings!) wanted to support the first ""presentation"" at Fringe San Miguel, 2016.  
Within a few weeks, the British contingent of the cast, Janet Prince (London) and Henrietta Weekes (New York), arrived in San Miguel, with John Morrow, a veteran theatre actor and director from New York, wearing the director's hat.   A local resident, the Peruvian actor, Enrique Argumedo, was signed up as the Spanish speaking actor. Eric Oliva, a renowned projectionist from Mexico City, jumped in to work with the images and text. Javier Estrada, a gypsy/flamenco guitarist, provided a soundscape.  They had three weeks to create something worth watching, and began rehearsals in the gorgeous Belles Artes (http://www.elnigromante.bellasartes.gob.mx)
THE SHOW and THE RESPONSE....
People loved it!  We thought we'd  illustrate this direct from the audience's mouths....  
""I'm a visual arts guy, but this really moved me - I actually got teary eyed, which I never do.  I saw my gallery transformed, and how much the audience responded...""  Skot Foreman, gallerist

<div>Hey there! My name is Lawrence Dandridge and I am the writer and composer of Something Like a Fairytale The Musical. This show has been apart of my life since it's conception in 2009. It started as a senior project that I forced onto my high school and it has slowly turned into what I honestly feel like is my life's purpose. I have written multiple musicals since then but Something Like a Fairytale is my baby!</div>
<div>A story within a story, A mother decides to tell her young daughter the story of how she and her husband came to be together. She turns the story into a fairytale so the little girl understands it better. In the fairytale world, we meet a princess who is faced with the decision to love as her heart desires or to put the needs of her family and kingdom above her own. Something Like a Fairytale holds a mirror up to honest love, friendship and what it truly means to follow your heart.</div>
<div>This show not only touches on universal subjects like parental pressure, love triangles, domestic disputes, and divorce (to name a few) but it also shines light on what it means to have a fairytale ending, specifically from the African American perspective. Through music that is influenced by many genres, this show takes us on a relatable journey that bridges the gap between the version of love we all long for and the version of love most of us actually get. It's fun, it's honest,  and it allows the audiences to see a piece of themselves in each character.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are aiming to raise $3,000! Because this is a huge show (with a cast about 26), we want to make sure that we are able to adequately create this world, visually on stage, just as much as we have on paper. This money will go towards set needs (wood, paint, lights, wheels, etc.) as we as costumes and wigs, rehearsal space fees, and other technical elements that this show requires . We have been given only a short 4 weeks to cast and mount this show and we have a $0 budget to pull from.  We really don't want to sacrifice the beauty of this show (or scrap it all together) due to monetary reasons.</p>
<p>Thankfully, because this show has been workshopped in many different ways over the past 6 years, we have a fully produced soundtrack recording of the show. If you pledge a donation of $100 of more, you can win a complete cast recording of Something Like a Fairytale! All of the music was written and arranged by me (Lawrence Dandridge) and was fully produced by Shaquan Welsh. This cast can saaaaang too so it's definitely worth the investment!</p>
<p>If we don't raise our entire goal, we may have to cut out majority of the show for the festival, or worse, not be able to participate in the festival at all. It's just too big of a show not to do on a full scale. Things can easily get lost in translation if the same actress playing the mom (wearing jeans and a T-shirt) is also seen on stage as the princess (In different jeans and a nicer T-shirt). You get me!? </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I think this is an opportunity that doesn't come around often for young men of color in the land of Musical Theatre. Lin Manuel Miranda (In The Heights, Hamilton) has definitely pushed down some doors in that regard but a black playwright in contemporary musical theatre hasn't emerged yet and I would love to be that guy! I think it's important for kids to go see shows and be able to think ""He looks like me... I can do that one day!"" </p>
<p>I am no stranger to the stage myself. I recently finished the second national tour of Sister Act The musical (TJ) and was featured in the 2015 National Black Theatre Festival.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>If I am being totally honest, this opportunity has come in the height of me being without a steady living space. I have been ""house hopping"" as I like to call it, with friends trying to save up enough to get my own place after my living arrangement fell through.

</div></div>","Short Summary.

What can an ancient fairy tale teach us about how human beings recover?
""My child, if I do not chop off both of your
hands, then the devil will take me away, and in my fear I have promised him to
do this. Help me in my need, and forgive me of the evil that I am going to do
to you.""
(from The Handless Maiden by the Brothers Grimm)
Over the last 18 months I have been researching variants of the story ""The Handless Maiden"" (you can read one version of it here), a huge, enigmatic tale about a girl whose father cuts off her hands in order to save himself from a  bad deal. The story describes how she travels to find a place of safety in a wild forest, marries a king, learns to create and in the process grows her hands back.
As part of the research I have been making contact with people who are healing in some way from something whether it be from illness, mental illness or addiction across the addiction recovery and asylum seeker communities. I want to make visible what I find out and share it with you!
Over the coming months I will be recording interviews with some of people I have met who have something to say about recovery. I'll also be responding creatively to what I find and turning it into immersive experiences in person and online which you (generous supporters) will to get to experience most of first!

<p></p>

<br/> <p><b><a href=""http://arachnepress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arachne Press</a></b> is a small publisher with big ideas. We publish mainly short stories and we love reading them aloud to an audience. Last year we launched<b> <a href=""http://arachnepress.com/solstice-shorts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Solstice Shorts Festival</a></b>, a hugely successful, free, live short story and folk music event that celebrated the winter solstice and short story day (21st December) on the prime meridian in Greenwich. It was all about TIME and ran from sunrise to sunset, with actors reading a new short story every half hour, and short sets of folk music in between. The event was funded partly by The Arts Council and partly by Crowdfunding.</p>

<p>We really want to keep the concept alive and growing, with plans afoot for another big event in 2019 (the next time the Solstice is at the weekend) and possibly a dawn reading event around the world,  (I said we have big ideas!) but this year we are aiming at a more modest event as the Solstice (and Short Story Day) fall on a Monday. As a result the theme this year is LONGEST NIGHT.</p>

<br/><p><b>Actors</b></p>
<p>We haven't cast the actors yet, we need to have some money committed before we can do that. We work regularly with some really fine but as yet  insufficiently appreciated actors - help us save them from being forced to be Santa or an Elf  this pre-christmas run!</p>
<p><b>Why you might want to help</b><br/></p>
<p>By contributing to the campaign you will make it possible to keep the event free, and accessible to everyone; at the same time as supporting writers, musicians and actors by not expecting them to give their time and talent for free.<br/></p>
<p>Solstice Shorts is celebratory - winter can be grim and the shortest day of the year is a turning point, the true new year, when the days finally start to lengthen again, if we can convince the sun to do its thing... We are keeping the tradition of winter storytelling alive and supporting new writing and local musicians. It's great fun too!</p>

</div></div>","What is Solstice Shorts?


 Arachne Press is a small publisher with big ideas. We publish mainly short stories and we love reading them aloud to an audience. Last year we launched Solstice Shorts Festival, a hugely successful, free, live short story and folk music event that celebrated the winter solstice and short story day (21st December) on the prime meridian in Greenwich. It was all about TIME and ran from sunrise to sunset, with actors reading a new short story every half hour, and short sets of folk music in between. The event was funded partly by The Arts Council and partly by Crowdfunding.


You can watch the videos of last year's event on Youtube

 Sunset in Greenwich on 21st December 2014
We really want to keep the concept alive and growing, with plans afoot for another big event in 2019 (the next time the Solstice is at the weekend) and possibly a dawn reading event around the world,  (I said we have big ideas!) but this year we are aiming at a more modest event as the Solstice (and Short Story Day) fall on a Monday. As a result the theme this year is LONGEST NIGHT.


We have the stories (and poems this year) chosen, and we have musicians planning their sets. Everything is about night and winter!
Authors & Poets

We have stories from David Mathews, David McVey, Frances Gapper, Neil Brosnan, Pauline Walker,Sarah Evans, Wendy Gill.
and poems from Abigail Beckel,Bob Beagrie, Sarah James.
Musicians
Ian Kennedy & Sarah Lloyd (folk duo with a great line in surprising lullabies), 


Vassilis Chatzimakris Trio (Cretan folk music, specialise in songs about the night), Vocal Chords (Local community choir with a repertoire of midwinter and night songs).


Actors
We haven't cast the actors yet, we need to have some money committed before we can do that. We work regularly with some really fine but as yet  insufficiently appreciated actors - help us save them from being forced to be Santa or an Elf  this pre-christmas run!
Why you might want to help
By contributing to the campaign you will make it possible to keep the event free, and accessible to everyone; at the same time as supporting writers, musicians and actors by not expecting them to give their time and talent for free.
Solstice Shorts is celebratory - winter can be grim and the shortest day of the year is a turning point, the true new year, when the days finally start to lengthen again, if we can convince the sun to do its thing... We are keeping the tradition of winter storytelling alive and supporting new writing and local musicians. It's great fun too!

What happens if we don't get enough...
 Obviously we hope we will get all the money, but if we don't we will scale back the event even more, but we really want it to happen - it is essential that we keep the concept going or we won't be able to achieve the 2019 extravaganza. 

We have to promote, but we could manage without the banner, just. We must pay the performers, and the licences and the insurance. Most other things are people's time, the most valuable commodity on earth! 

If we really can't put on the show this year, we'll use the funds collected towards next year - having money already allocated would help enormously with getting Arts Council funding.
  

   The ImpactLast year we created an anthology from the short stories we read at the event - they were all new stories and for many of the authors it was their first time in print. Nearly 200 people attended at least part of the festival, which on the last Sunday before Christmas was quite something. (We had people queueing to get in at 8am, to get the sunrise reading.) If we can keep the festival going it greatly improves our chances of Arts Council funding in the future.

  Risks & ChallengesIt's always a risk putting on a single event - we have all our eggs in one basket. That's why we include insurance.

<div>
<i>Raisins in a Glass of Milk</i>  is a one act play that brings the hilarious, heart-breaking and shocking stories and experiences of actors of color from across the country, out of the darkness and into the spotlight. Through this collection of scenes and monologues we aim to show that People of Color should finally be seen as a standard, essential part of storytelling as opposed to stereotypes, controversies, and out of date statements.</div>

<ul> </ul> </div> <p>Thank you so much for all your support, see you at the Fringe!</p></div>","Hello! It's Madison Maylin and James Lawrence of Black Sheep Productions, here - a new film and theatre company that seeks to tell important, thrilling, and bold stories. Thanks for taking a look at our fundraising page.
We're the team behind Tyke - a gripping new play by Rebecca Monks that imagines the events leading up to the true story of an abused circus elephant’s tragic break for freedom. We're taking the show to this summer's Edinburgh Fringe Festival for a full (month-long) run, with three previews at Above The Arts Theatre in Leicester Square. 10% of all our takings at the Fringe will go to a (soon to be chosen) animal welfare charity.


So, what's it about?

Proudlove’s world-famous circus is crumbling. Faced with a financial crisis, his enterprise could fold within a year. The ringmaster knows he needs to bring in the crowds to save it, and for this, he’s relying on his prize attraction: Tyke the elephant.

Stefan – Proudlove’s protégé – is tasked with teaching Tyke new and more demanding tricks. He hires a skilled and passionate apprentice, Veronica, to assist him. The two fall in love, but their relationship is tested when she rebukes the circus’ brutal training methods.


This touching new play is grounded in the true story of Tyke – who killed her trainer in front of thousands of circus spectators, escaped, and died in a hail of gunfire. The play uses puppetry to explore love, power, morality, and animal nature.


Why does it matter?
The play revisits and explores one of most infamous deaths of a wild animal in captivity - asking questions about our morality and power as human beings. 


Our treatment of animals and our reasons for keeping them in captivity is still at the forefront of a global conversation. You may have heard of Harambe, the Gorilla shot dead in Cincinnati Zoo last month; or you may have watched Blackfish, a documentary that changed how the world viewed Killer Whales in Seaworld. 


Sharing Tyke's story is important because wild animals are still mistreated all over the world, and right here in the UK, it's still legal to use wild animals in circuses. 



   Why are you fundraising?
Taking a show up to the Fringe is expensive, and our project requires a big team to pull it off.  As a company, we aim to be completely open with everyone who works with us, and those who help fund us can expect the same transparency. Below you can see how far your donation could go.



Puppet: Tyke is a beautiful life-size elephant puppet which is being built by the extremely talented Maia Kirkman-Richards. Approx £400 for materials

Accommodation and travel: We have to get our 6 performers and Tyke up to Edinburgh, and put a roof over their heads for a month. Approx £2,250

Marketing / flyers / posters / listings in apps and magazines: With so many shows at the Fringe, getting the word out is essential: Approx £600

50% of all donations will go directly to our performing company
40% to recouping production expenses (if we don't raise enough here)
10% to an animal welfare charity




How can I help?


We hope to create stimulating and moving theatre whilst contributing to a vital global discussion on animal welfare. We want to raise money and awareness for an amazing cause. And we don't want Tyke's story to finish in Edinburgh, we are aiming to secure a transfer or tour of the show, and your contribution helps us reach a potential audience of thousands.
But to do this, we need your help. We have a range of really exciting perks for those who contribute to our campaign:

 Free tickets and a glass of prosecco to our West End previews
Signed posters and memorabilia from the show
Free photoshoot
Free 1-hour puppet workshop with Tyke herself
1 week stay in a luxury villa for 8 people in Puerto Banus, Marbella

Can't contribute financially? We totally get it. Really, we do. But could you help us make some noise around the show?

<h3>Hi!  I'm Jadrian, and this is my beard.</h3>
<p>I've done all kinds of stupid things with my facial hair over the years...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474052229/armjmjqnz1pgsc5xilj7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>... but in 2011 I wondered what would happen if I just stopped trying to shape or trim it at all. I've always just kept new facial hair designs until I got sick of them, and I figured I'd get tired of having a big, unruly beard within about a year or so. Turns out I was wrong. It kept growing and growing, untrimmed and untamed, for five years.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474055814/cugc1hew6i7nfcbozqxq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Though the time has finally come to cut it off, I've always thought it would be fun if it were detachable, so I could lend it out to other folks who've told me they wished they had a big weird beard like mine. I had a dream of secretly making it into a wig, continuing to wear it so people thought I still had a beard, and then ripping it off dramatically at the end of my dissertation defense. (Turned out that wasn't in the cards.) I wanted to lend it out to drag-king friends in Minneapolis to use in shows, or to baby-faced North Carolinians or Brooklynites who couldn't grow their own but needed some beard cred.</p>
<p>Really, my belief has always been that the primary purpose of facial hair is to add weirdness to the world, and now I have an opportunity to keep that going beyond my own face. I'd love to get your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474306704/iyz5yvkc03ogkyiokeoq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $500 to cover the costs of turning my beard into a wig. The vast majority of it (probably about $400) will go to a professional theater costume / make-up artist to cut off my beard, make a mold of my face, and then build a wig from the beard hairs to fit the mold and replicate the original. It's very important to me to pay artists fairly, and building a wig is a specialized and time-consuming task.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will cover my travel costs in case I have to contract an out-of-state artist. I will donate any extra money to the <a href=""http://srlp.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sylvia Rivera Law Project</a>, which does wonderful work to support trans*, intersex, and gender-non-conforming people across the USA.</p>
<p>This is a ""flexible funding"" campaign, so if donations fall short of the goal, I'll still use your money: I'll donate 10% of it to the SRLP, pay the rest to the artist, and make up the remaining pay for the artist and other costs with my own funds.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In return for your donation, you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first photos of my chin in more than five years</li>
<li>A behind-the-scenes look at the process of making the wig</li>
<li>A postcard with (optional) beard hair</li>
<li>Updates on the campaign and photos of other people with the beard wig</li>
<li>A reservation to borrow my beard for two weeks!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's hard for me to say goodbye to this beard, but this project is a fun way to send it out with a bang, to make a small positive impact for trans rights, and to share the weirdness and wonder of having a big beard with more people. A big beard is always a conversation starter, and has a surprising way of bringing people together. Think of how much stranger those conversations would be if you could let someone else try it on for a moment!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have only second-hand knowledge of making wigs, so I'm contracting out that task to a yet-to-be-determined artist. This means that, though I'll do my best, I can't personally guarantee the quality of the outcome. It's entirely possible that the wig will turn out not to be sturdy enough to ship or to wear often, or it might just be ugly. (Well, uglier than my beard already is.)</p>
<p>The main things I can do to mitigate this risk are carefully research an artist, clearly explain what I'm going for, and pay them to take their time. Through many years of friendships, volunteering, and dabbling, I have a lot of experience communicating with artists, so I think this process will be successful.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you think this idea sounds fun, there are a few things (other than contributing) that you can do to help it come to fruition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow your own wacky beard, turn it into a wig, and get it out into the world! The beardier the merrier!</li>
<li>Share this page with your friends!</li>
<li>If you know a theater artist with experience building wigs, get them in touch with me! (Especially if they live near Philadelphia.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, and spread the word!</p>

  Risks & ChallengesTimes are tough for small collectives such a Dry with a Twist, and the cost of producing in New York City, even at an independent level, is sometimes crippling. Without your support we will not be able to given these actors, designers and musicians the opportunity to showcase their craft for an audience made up of industry, fellow artists, global companies and our beloved friends and family as afforded in this incredible opportunity by participating in the Festival.

<p>The majority of funding will go to covering the cost of postcards (lots and lots and lots of postcards, as that's the main mode of advertisement in the Fringe.)

<h3>Hold Up. Specifically: Where's The Money Going?</h3>
<div>So glad you asked! Here's the breakdown:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Production Fee - $450</div>
<div>Postcards - $300 (approx. 30 postcards per venue x 16 venues x 9 days)</div>
<div>Programs - $100</div>
<div>Stipends for Cast and Crew - $250</div>
<div>Featured Show Status - $100</div>
<div>Set Design - $150</div>
<div>Costumes - $150</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These numbers are as close of approximations as we can make right now, and of course, are subject to change depending on how much funding we get. Of course, the more funding we get, the better we can advertise our show and increase the production value. If we get more than our projected amount, that money will be spent towards additional promotion and paying our cast and crew more than just the box office payout.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>So What's Stopping Us?</h3> <p>We've received financial assistance with the production costs for this show. The Fringe typically requires a $450 production fee be paid upfront. Due to us being college students without $450 at the helm, the Fringe delayed the payment and will take that money out of the box office at the end. Delaying payment like this can be a risk, if a show doesn't get many people in the doors and receives under $450 in box office sales. That would mean the artist gets no money and the Fringe loses money. That's bad.</p>
<p>While that is a potential risk, it's a risk we shouldn't have to worry about. While it's not critically necessary, it would be ideal to be able to pay some (if not all) of the production fee from fundraising. That would mean more money from the box office going directly to the artists. That's good.</p>
<p>But the biggest challenge is the time constraint. We're trying our darnedest to make a spooky, beautiful (spookily beautiful? beautifully spooky?) show in a month and a few days. And we'll make it. But we'll be working on it every day from now until August. We're working on a strict schedule. And with you on board with us, we can ensure that that month-and-a-few-weeks go by in smooth sailing.</p>

<p>""How?"" you ask.</p>
<p>""Well,"" we say, leaning forward in our chair, assuming a dramatic voice. ""The <i>internets.""</i></p>
<p>Yes: the internet. Social media is incredibly powerful and waayyyyyy cheaper than print. We'd love it if you could boost our show on whatever social media platforms you use. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, Yelp, Foursquare (idk, whatever you use.)</p>
<p>If you're interested in joining our street team, get in contact with us! (We don't actually have a street team yet, but that could totally be a thing that happens.)</p>
<p>I guess what we're trying to say is: make noise. If you can't donate, or even if you can: get the word out there.

Five astronauts are trapped inside a spaceship en route to terraform a distant planet. Discussions of memories evolve into heated discussions on whether or not ghosts and aliens exist. Then, when the lights begin to falter, they gradually begin to expect the worst. Then the unimaginable happens.
Merkur and Venera has gone through several revisions in a short span of time. A little over a year ago, the first draft was hastily written in between classes.

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>“It started when a friend sent me a written copy of a breakup conversation,” says artist Clint Bagwell. “I was challenged to find actors who would re-create the real-life event and interpret it in their own way.” The six scheduled shows use the same script, but each is uniquely delivered by a different set of performers.</p>
<blockquote style=""color:DeepPink;"">
<span style=""font-size:30px;"">""Artist Clint Bagwell has lifted the virtual messages of an ending relationship, into a heightened theatrical piece that is memorably gender-defied.""</span><br/><span style=""font-size:20px;"">--Benjamin Dennis, DC Metro Theater Arts</span>
</blockquote>
<p>The play follows “Cameron” and “Dale” as they rehash the their brief but intense encounter. <i>A Breakup Is Swift</i> promises nothing profound in the words that are spoken; instead the actors offer a hyper-realistic portrayal of two people talking in an honest way. The artist recounts the early stages of his creative process: “when I read the text, I didn’t want to alter anything, but I did change names and references to specific locations. I found that if I also made the gender of each character open, we could play with those possibilities.”</p>
<p>Actor <strong>Ben Kleymeyer</strong> plays “Dale” in two different performances; once against a male “Cameron” then again with a female version. “Creating two different characters from the same text is not something I’ve done before. They ultimately have the same goals/needs/character traits, but what is different is how these things manifest themselves… and how they interact with the other character. I imagine it to be like what would happen if you watched the same person in two different relationships,” he explains.</p>

<p>7 Doors is a story of loss, pain and hope told through powerful choreography and dynamic original music</p>
<p><i><strong>The Impact</strong></i></p>
<p>The idea of 7 Doors came to me through my own painful experience of loss. A divorce that felt like a death! I was so devastated and thought, how am I even existing? How will I ever feel normal again? It was one of the hardest things I've been through. But being on the other side of that loss I am stronger, wiser and my ability to love is greater. Surviving that pain showed me how fragile and precious life is and how powerful LOVE can be.  - <i><strong>Alessandro Pellicani, creator and director/choreographer</strong></i></p>
<p>I've had similar life experiences, as have so many others. Through this show we believe we can bring the human experience to the stage in a way that hasn't been done before. It was so incredible to share the beginning of this project with an audience back in April at BAM studios. The response was so overwhelmingly positive that we know this project will succeed. Our ultimate goal is to eventually bring it on a Broadway Stage. Be a part of our dream!  -<i><strong>Jesse Brewster, co-creator and composer/lyricist</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>What are we asking:</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking for $43,000 so that we will be able to continue our developmental journey to a full production stage, paying for the performance and rehearsal space, the cast and creative team, stage manager, and travel for our composer, aerial choreographer and videographer </li>
<li>we are excited to offer you unique perks in exchange for your generous donation, check them out. Especially if you like to dance and Italian cusine.</li>
<li>In case we don't reach our goal we will use the funds to record and master as many songs as possible that will be featured on a full length album of the show's soundtrack.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're All Friends Here present <strong>In. A. Hoop.</strong>, the first production in a body of works created through verbatim montage. Writer Darren Yorke, director Sarah Bradley and aerial performer and actor, Kate Finegan have collaborated on this piece. </p>
<p><strong>In. A. Hoop.</strong> has been accepted to be showcased as part of the <strong>Scene + Heard Festival</strong> of new works in progress in <strong>Smock Alley</strong> in February 2017. </p>
<p>The <strong>Scene + Heard Festival</strong> graciously provides an excellent platform for developing work, allowing it to be critiqued by its audience who give honest feedback through a variety of mediums. </p>
<p><b>In. A. Hoop. </b>will have the opportunity to be seen by a number of representatives from producing companies, venues and festivals, who, if they see potential in the project, are in a position to support it as it develops further towards full production stage.</p>
<p>Your donation would contribute to covering the logistical costs of safely staging an aerial performance, which are outlined in more detail below :-)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are running this project on an incredibly low budget, but due to the collaborative nature of this unfunded festival, potential income from box office will still not be sufficient to cover our costs.</p>
<p><strong>We are raising €500</strong> to cover our expenses for staging <strong>In. A. Hoop.</strong> at the <strong>Scene + Heard Festival</strong> this February.</p>
<p>This money will go towards hiring a <strong>professional aerial technician</strong> to rig the aerial hoop in the venue in compliance with health and safety standards, the hire of aerial performance <strong>rehearsal space</strong>, <strong>flyers </strong>and<strong> costume</strong>.</p>
<p>Although we have a small amount to raise, we are still offering some great perks for your donation. You can get <strong>tickets for the show</strong> and a <strong>free flexibility class</strong> with Kate, our performer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>In. A. Hoop.</strong> is innovative art in its exploration of <strong>verbatim montage</strong> as a form of dramatic writing and as a <strong>combination of aerial dance and theatre</strong> in a one-woman style show.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will covering the logistical costs</strong> of staging this formally inventive  production. </p>
<p>Projects like this are increasingly difficult to acquire funding for as the arts are now funded on a project-by-project basis in Ireland, leaving little room for the development of scripts and the invaluable amount of audience feedback that comes with the <strong>Scene + Heard Festival</strong>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are almost there! A wise person once said that the hardest thing was coming up with an idea. </p>
<p>The folks at <strong>Scene + Heard certainly think we've got something great to give</strong> and we have been working our socks off developing the script and performance. With a <strong>proven track record in successful theatre and performance work</strong>, our cast and crew are sure to knock it out of the park.</p>
<p>The big risk facing us is that <strong>without this money, we would be unable to safely prepare the theatre</strong> for the show, and therefore, could face cancelling the performance. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

In this masterful performance, AmyJo skillfully guides her audience through an experience of ancient sacred stories from the voice of the feminine that remaps the shape of how we have been told to view the world and be in it; shifting the painful stories of domination, scarcity, separation and control to a tale of abundance, co-creation, sensuality and unity.</p><p>This transformational work retells the stories that divide, separate and breed fear in our collective consciousness, inspiring all who see the performance to become cultural and societal change agents. Please help this master storyteller, biblical scholar and agent of inspiration bring <i>From Eve to Me</i> to the stage!</p><p><strong>LIVING INTO A NEW STORY  - At a time when our world appears fragmented, hostile and unbelievably misogynist, a new foundational story is necessary. You can be a part of this movement to heal the world!</strong></p><p>As a Lutheran Pastor, AmyJo heard the stories of her congregants burdened with the belief that no matter what they did, they were not good enough. As a university professor, she read the life-stories of students who routinely struggled with the idea that they were flawed and had to prove their worth. Living and working around the world taught her that this is a shared phenomenon. You may have struggled with these feelings yourself.</p><p>Story is the way we learn. We are shaped in spirit and mind by the narratives we tell as well as by the collective stories that have shaped society. The Creation Myth is the foundation of Western Civilization. Shared by three world religions, this story has done more to disconnect and separate individuals from their true, authentic heart and from each other, than any story ever told.</p><p>Re-telling this story from the long-silenced voice of Eve allows us to experience Her story live, to connect with the wisdom and reality of Love, and to remember the creativity and abundance of our souls. Retelling the most potent and foundational story of our civilization will profoundly alter the reality of our world today.</p><p>Contributing to <i>From Eve to Me</i> is making possible the dissemination of badly needed medicine for a society sick from the story of domination, judgement, separation and scarcity.</p><p>Funding <i>From Eve to Me</i> brings healing to individuals who struggle with the dis-ease of self-doubt and to the wider community by dissolving the illusion of separation and weaving a web of interconnection through Love. </p><p>If you haven’t seen the show, but would <a href=""https://vimeo.com/190152945/9f00be9650?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=vimeo-cliptranscode-201504&amp;utm_campaign=29220"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">love to experience it vicariously </a>… here’s what people are saying about <i>From Eve to Me</i>:</p><p><strong><i>""I laughed, I cried, I grieved the pain of all women who were never able to share their stories, or who were never witnessed for their truth and love.  Thank you for bringing these women to life, so we might see them in a different way.  Finally HERstory is being told!""</i></strong> Cindy Ma, Founder and Host, SHE Living TV. Berkeley CA</p><p><strong><i>""Mesmerizing. Energetic. Honest. Empowering. Inspiring.""</i> </strong>Heather, CA.</p><p><strong><i>“Damaging patriarchal stories were re-told in a way that was actually healing; no one was made wrong. It was truly an opening up to love.”</i></strong>  Brian, CA.</p><p><strong><i>“The combination of AmyJo’s scholarship, years of experience, skills and deep believing in how it was, allows her to transform a very old, limiting and often degrading story, into Love, allowing us to see More than One Side of the Story.”</i></strong> Brenda, CA.</p><p><strong><i>“To say I was captivated the moment AmyJo started speaking, would be an understatement. She has a real authentic gift for creating meaning through metaphor and every sense of my being was wrapped up in the words she spoke, as she told the spiritual tale. Time stood still, and it felt as though we were all holding our breath…watching, waiting as AmyJo relived the story and made it understandable and real.”</i> </strong>Karen, England</p><p><i><strong>“AmyJo is riveting as a sacred storyteller. As she weaves the story, she transports you back in time and into the thoughts and emotions of the main character so that you too, experience the event on a visceral level. I was mesmerized during her performance and have reflected back on her teaching numerous times.”</strong> Bonnie, Indiana</i></p><p><strong>CALL TO ACTION!</strong></p><ul>

In this masterful performance, AmyJo skillfully guides her audience through an experience of ancient sacred stories from the voice of the feminine that remaps the shape of how we have been told to view the world and be in it; shifting the painful stories of domination, scarcity, separation and control to a tale of abundance, co-creation, sensuality and unity.This transformational work retells the stories that divide, separate and breed fear in our collective consciousness, inspiring all who see the performance to become cultural and societal change agents. Please help this master storyteller, biblical scholar and agent of inspiration bring From Eve to Me to the stage!LIVING INTO A NEW STORY  - At a time when our world appears fragmented, hostile and unbelievably misogynist, a new foundational story is necessary. You can be a part of this movement to heal the world!As a Lutheran Pastor, AmyJo heard the stories of her congregants burdened with the belief that no matter what they did, they were not good enough. As a university professor, she read the life-stories of students who routinely struggled with the idea that they were flawed and had to prove their worth. Living and working around the world taught her that this is a shared phenomenon. You may have struggled with these feelings yourself.Story is the way we learn. We are shaped in spirit and mind by the narratives we tell as well as by the collective stories that have shaped society. The Creation Myth is the foundation of Western Civilization. Shared by three world religions, this story has done more to disconnect and separate individuals from their true, authentic heart and from each other, than any story ever told.Re-telling this story from the long-silenced voice of Eve allows us to experience Her story live, to connect with the wisdom and reality of Love, and to remember the creativity and abundance of our souls. Retelling the most potent and foundational story of our civilization will profoundly alter the reality of our world today.Contributing to From Eve to Me is making possible the dissemination of badly needed medicine for a society sick from the story of domination, judgement, separation and scarcity.Funding From Eve to Me brings healing to individuals who struggle with the dis-ease of self-doubt and to the wider community by dissolving the illusion of separation and weaving a web of interconnection through Love. If you haven’t seen the show, but would love to experience it vicariously … here’s what people are saying about From Eve to Me:""I laughed, I cried, I grieved the pain of all women who were never able to share their stories, or who were never witnessed for their truth and love.  Thank you for bringing these women to life, so we might see them in a different way.  Finally HERstory is being told!"" Cindy Ma, Founder and Host, SHE Living TV. Berkeley CA""Mesmerizing. Energetic. Honest. Empowering. Inspiring."" Heather, CA.“Damaging patriarchal stories were re-told in a way that was actually healing; no one was made wrong. It was truly an opening up to love.”  Brian, CA.“The combination of AmyJo’s scholarship, years of experience, skills and deep believing in how it was, allows her to transform a very old, limiting and often degrading story, into Love, allowing us to see More than One Side of the Story.” Brenda, CA.“To say I was captivated the moment AmyJo started speaking, would be an understatement. She has a real authentic gift for creating meaning through metaphor and every sense of my being was wrapped up in the words she spoke, as she told the spiritual tale. Time stood still, and it felt as though we were all holding our breath…watching, waiting as AmyJo relived the story and made it understandable and real.” Karen, England“AmyJo is riveting as a sacred storyteller. As she weaves the story, she transports you back in time and into the thoughts and emotions of the main character so that you too, experience the event on a visceral level. I was mesmerized during her performance and have reflected back on her teaching numerous times.” Bonnie, IndianaCALL TO ACTION!

Re-Telling the Story of Struggle to Grace! Anyone who has ever given birth to a new project or raised a child knows that there is a risk that your idea will stumble. As an artist and a mother, the challenge is to live from the belief and tenacity that it is time for From Eve to Me to go out into the world.As a creator, AmyJo strives to live into the story of endless possibility, grace, ease, abundance and trust that when we follow our hearts and listen to our instinct, the path is opened and connections with all that we need align.There are so many stories to re-tell and so many people to reach! If we do not receive additional funding, we will not be able to expand, to hire support staff or to focus on creating more sacred stories.To address these challenges, the team at From Eve to Me is committed to the following:1)  Creatively sourcing performances so that From Eve to Me has a consistent schedule of shows for individuals to attend.2)  Remembering that From Eve to Me is bigger than any one person and engaging others in this movement.3) Focusing on building and expanding the show’s reach using whatever means possible.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What we're up to</h3>
<p>Simply put, we have set out to create the best show that we can offer you. We believe in the power of live theater to remind ourselves and our audiences that we're not as separate as we might appear to be, and that genuine communion between people is still possible. Live theater creates this communion, and now more than ever we see this as necessary and beautiful—even integral to our survival.</p>
<p>We also seek to entertain, pure and simple. Since we don't do shows very often and don't have the foundational support of an established, year-round theater company, we need your support. You can help in three easy ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come see our show</li>
<li>Contribute to this campaign</li>
<li>Spread the word like wildfire (via word of mouth, social media, personal emails, and the Indiegogo share tools)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel compelled and can help in any way, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. </p>

<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>We are committed to paying each artist that works on this show. And we're equally committed to putting on one of the BEST shows you'll ever see. In order to achieve these two goals, here's how our funding needs break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The play's budget is $9,185. That includes space rental; paying six designers (theatrical and marketing), a stage manager, two board operators, two stage hands, a box office manager; set, props and costumes; marketing (posters, programs and a newspaper ad); and our promo video. (The actors and show creators are deferring payment.)</li>
<li>We expect (fingers crossed) to make $4000 in ticket sales.</li>
<li>That means we need to raise at least $5,185 to cover our costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for this, you get to see a show that you won't soon forget, know that you are an integral part of supporting this one-of-a-kind experience that will bring people closer together, and maybe even get a poster and/or a Treefort Pass.</p>
<h3>Why help?</h3>
<p>Instead of us telling you why, we'll let our friends and community tell you why:</p>

Although we started working on the concept of this piece in Spring of 2016 it has become more evident that the differences that make up our country need to be better understood. We know that through performance we are able to open up lines of communication that were once closed, encourage people to see things in new ways and open up a different dialogue.
We have done much with very little since 2014 and we know we can have an even greater impact with your support.
Dance depends on people like you and your generous support. 


Risks & Challenges
The Van Dyke Performance space is a brand new state of the art dance theatre that can seat  200 patrons. It will be challenging to fill the house for our Greensboro Fringe Run. But we know our work is not just for the art community and often touches people from all walks of life.
After filling The Crown Space at the Carolina Theatre in March 2016 we are up for the challenge of filling this space.  We are so excited to reach audience members from many backgrounds and all ages.

<p><strong>The Lost Teaspoons by Vincent N. D’Onofrio</strong> is part of the emerging wave of twenty-first century American plays, written in the classic style that looks back in order to see forward.  The play is the journey of a teen- Doug, navigating his way through the urban mine fields of the 1950s Bronx.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Lost Teaspoons</strong></i>  is topical and universal in its themes: Youth, Struggle, Broken Homes, First Loves, Forlorn Dreams, PTSD Veterans, Dementia in old age, and of course Hope.</p>
<p>Under the direction of <strong>WENDY TONKEN</strong>, we've assembled a cast of top-notch actors who will bring this play to life!  OBIE Award winner <strong>ROSINA FERNHOFF*</strong>, <strong>ROBERT FUNARO*</strong> (The Sopranos, Vinyl, American Gangster,) <strong>CHRISTIAN MUSTO*, PATRICK HERAGHTY, WILFREDO ROLDAN, EMILY DALTON, MARY LAHTI, </strong>and <strong>LOUIS HERRERA.</strong></p>
<p>* Appearing Courtesy of Actors Equity Assoc. </p>
<p><strong><u>Why This Matters</u></strong> </p>
<p>Theater is the magic carpet of civilization where  humble lives are ennobled and inspiration is on display. With the help of scenery, lights and makeup, the stage becomes a mirror  to see ourselves.  Join the cast of the Lost Teaspoons who peer into that mirror and... </p>
<p>This is  the dark side of the fabulous 50s- without the rock n roll and ‘fifteen cents a slice pizza’. The Bronx was a tough place to be sixteen and independent with no family to fall back on- Where every day was a struggle to survive. Yet, armed with a dream and ferocious determination, Doug learns to accept the hand he was dealt and sail by the winds of his faith, hope and courage.</p>
<p>This is a story of urban struggle- showing a teen trying to make something of himself even when no one else believes he can! <i><strong>The Lost Teaspoons </strong></i>is a story with a dual message: Never lose <i>hope</i> in yourself  and  believing that, can  change anything. </p>
<p>That's the message we are asking you to support! </p>
<p><strong><u>A Note About the Play</u></strong></p>
<p> <i><strong>The Lost Teaspoons  </strong></i>has been a labor of love - three years in development with two  well received readings that included talk backs with the audience.</p>
<p>Now, it's time for you to witness the journey, feel the passion and the excitement as Doug slowly unravels the mysteries of growing up, even as his world is falling down around him.</p>

<h3>What Are We Doing?!</h3>
<p>We are <strong>Double Blind Productions</strong> a new collaborative group of performers - aerialists, clowns, jugglers, dancers, actors, musicians + a writer and visual artist. We are dedicated to telling complex stories through circus and provoking our audiences to make meaningful choices as part of the work.</p>
<p>We are based in Pittsburgh, Boulder, and New York City.</p> <p>Escape Velocity is our first production and we are thrilled to have a confirmed performance and venue as part of the New Hazlett Theater’s CSA series. Three members of our group - Mandy Hackman, Moriah Ella Mason, and Angela Whalen - grew up in southwestern PA reading tarot and imagining future experimental performances. Now over 10 years later we are joined by an all-star cast of collaborators (Miles Wilder, O’Ryan the O’Mazing, John Hackman, Robert Guido, and the Bombyx Collective) returning to our roots and crafting a multiple-choice narrative circus.</p>
<p><br/>With your support we will have the resources to create and document a polished, professional performance. We will be able to premiere Escape Velocity to the crowds in Pittsburgh and then pursue touring the production around the country.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need From You! </h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costume our cast of 10 ($700)</li>
<li>Purchase props to fill out our world under the Big Top ($250)</li>
<li>Purchase additional rigging for our aerial acts so we can replace older parts and stay safe! ($600)</li>
<li>Provide a travel stipend for our Boulder-based artists to travel to Pittsburgh ($1,000)</li>
<li>Rent a projector ($400)</li>
<li>Purchase additional documentation in photos and videos ($500)</li>
<li>Offer stipends to our artists (because paying artists is important! And many of us will have to take some time away from our day jobs to make this show happen) ($5,500)</li>
</ul> <p>We have been fortunate to receive two small grants, but we still need to raise $5,500 in order to cover the gaps. That’s why we’re turning to our community. If you love the circus, risk-taking art, immersive theater, tarot decks, chance operation, or people dressed up as dancing bears, we are asking you to donate today and help Escape Velocity take flight!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are doing something unique in the world of theatre by expanding the role of circus arts on a modern American stage. We hope this is the first of many such productions meshing live music performance with circus arts contained within an original story. </p>
<p>We also have lots of ways to say thank you to our supporters and super-fans including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original artwork buttons so you can deck out your backpack or favorite jean jacket</li>
<li>A signed Midway poster of your favorite sideshow</li>
<li>A copy of the original tarot deck used in the show (The Wayfarer’s Deck) signed by the principles</li>
<li>Tickets to a work-in-progress showing and cocktail party in Denver/Boulder or Pittsburgh</li>
<li>An in-person or skype Tarot reading</li>
<li>An in-person or skype “circus strong” personal training session so you can run away and join us under the Big Top</li>
<li>Invitation to the dress rehearsal in Pittsburgh where you will get to see all three endings of the show (this is the only way you are guaranteed to see every ending!)</li>
<li>Downloadable vimeo link to the show after its premiere (so you can keep it forever like the precious treasure it is ;)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>We’ve chosen a flexible-funding campaign. Even if we don’t raise our goal the show will go on! . . . But we’ll have to compromise on artist stipends, costumes/props, and documentation. We believe that artists deserve to be paid for their work and that audiences deserve the fullest realization of a project’s vision. Please help us make that happen today by donating at whatever level you can.</p>

<h3>The Push Comedy Theater</h3>
<p>In 2014, The Push opened in Norfolk's <strong>NEON</strong> district.  In that time, we have brought Hampton Roads hundreds of shows, classes and workshops.  The Push has become home to the <strong>Norfolk Comedy Festival</strong>, <strong>The 666 Project: The Horror Anthology Show</strong>, <strong>Panties in a Twist: The All-Female Comedy Show</strong>, <strong>Who Dunnit: The Improvised Murder Mystery</strong>, <strong>Tales from the Campfire</strong>, <strong>Tell Me More Storytelling</strong> and countless other improv, sketch and stand-up comedy shows. </p>
<h3>Why A Crowdfunding Campaign?</h3>
<p>To be perfectly honest... we've starting to outgrow our space.  We have simply run out of room at the Push.  Currently, classes are taught Sunday through Thursday and shows on Fridays and Saturdays.  We have some great new shows in the pipeline, but nowhere on the schedule to put them.  We have the demand for more classes and workshops, but nowhere to teach them.</p>
<p>That's where the <strong>Push Comedy Theater Training Center</strong> comes in.  With the new <strong>Training </strong><strong>Center</strong>,<strong> </strong>we can now have shows Wednesday through Sunday.  It means we can have classes going on simultaneously at the Push and the Training Center.  It means our groups and house teams will need a place to rehearse.  It means more awesome comedy for Hampton Roads.</p>
<h3>The Push Comedy Theater Training Center</h3>
<p>The Training Center will be located at 2710 Granby Street in Norfolk, VA.  It will consist of 2 large classrooms that can be used for improv, sketch and stand-up classes, as well as rehearsals.  We will be able to have 2 classes going on at the Training Center while shows or additional classes are going on at the theater.  Our office, which currently resides at the theater, shares the same space as our props and costumes.  We will move the office to the training center, which will give us more space for and the ability to better organize our props and costumes.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We've found the perfect spot, we've signed the lease and construction has begun.  But we need help making our training center a home.  We need lobby furniture, chairs for the classrooms, computers for the office, tv for the sketch room, refrigerator for the break room, lighting fixtures, sign, permits and the myriad of little things that quickly add up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a lot of fun and exciting gifts for those who donate.  They run the gamut from useful (tickets, classes, t-shirts) to weird (vegan lunch with Ed Carden, a game of Risk with the Pushers) to the downright unnecessary (a poetry reading by Brad McMurran).</p>
<p>We're making sure that no matter how much or how little you give, you'll walk away with something awesome... or at least somewhat memorable.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>The Push Comedy Theater </strong>has quickly become an important part of the <strong>City of Norfolk</strong> and the Hampton Roads arts community.  With your help, we can ensure that the Push Comedy Theater continues to grow and continues to bring great comedy and comedians to the 757.</p>
</div><div><h3>I Want To Help But I'm Broke</h3></div><div>
<p>We understand.  Which is why we have pledge levels as low as $2.  But there are other ways you can help besides giving money.  Spread the word about the Push Comedy Theater Training Center and our Indiegogo campaign.  Share it on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Heck, you can even share it on Google +.  Tell your friends and relatives about it.  Make it the subject of conversation on your next Tinder date.  Believe it or not, there are still some people out there who don't even realize the Push Comedy Theater exists.  So please help spread the word.</p>
<h3>If I Donate, When Will I Get To See The Training Center</h3>
<p>If all goes according to plan... and the contract gods smile favorably upon us, the Push Comedy Theater Training Center will be open for business in January 2018.</p>

<h3><i><strong>The Impact</strong></i></h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong><i>The Maya in Me</i></strong> seeks to educate and inspire audiences by telling a story of transparency, faith, and resilience, through artistic expression and the wisdom of Dr. Maya Angelou. We plan to begin production in the city of Los Angeles in the Summer of 2018. Based on research, there has not been a one-person stage production of one's personal story where Dr. Angelou shares similar experiences and advice. </p>
<p>Set in New Orleans, Louisiana, the story begins with an all too familiar scenario during childhood, walks the audience through her young adult life as 1/2 of a dysfunctional relationship, and progresses to an escape marriage, all while working toward a Doctorate degree. There are many twists and turns during this ride of love and life.  </p>
<p>The first stage play produced by Dr. Bob, titled ""It's a Man's Thing"" received rave reviews. Audiences were pleased with the manner in which she was able to connect the life of the Black male with their contribution to society. She has since gone on to produce, direct, and write meaningful works, leaving the audience in awe. </p>

<p>33 1/3 – House of Dreams, by Jonathan Rosenberg and Brad Ross, is the story behind the most prolific and successful independent recording studio in history and the visionary who helped create it, Stan Ross. Gold Star Recording Studios served as a “mecca” for the West Coast music scene from 1950 to 1984—a period of tremendous social and political change in our country. Over 120 Billboard Top 40 hits and hundreds of other memorable songs were produced in this small Hollywood studio on the corner of Santa Monica Blvd and Vine Street, including the number one most frequently played song in the history of radio, The Righteous Brothers’ “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’.” This unparalleled success was due to the efforts of Stan and his dedicated team of employees including Grammy Award-winning engineer, Larry Levine.</p>
<p>The innovations of Ross’s creative engineering methods and his unabashed charisma put Gold Star on the musical map as the studio where hits were made..

</div></div>","33 1/3 – House of Dreams, by Jonathan Rosenberg and Brad Ross, is the story behind the most prolific and successful independent recording studio in history and the visionary who helped create it, Stan Ross. Gold Star Recording Studios served as a “mecca” for the West Coast music scene from 1950 to 1984—a period of tremendous social and political change in our country. Over 120 Billboard Top 40 hits and hundreds of other memorable songs were produced in this small Hollywood studio on the corner of Santa Monica Blvd and Vine Street, including the number one most frequently played song in the history of radio, The Righteous Brothers’ “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’.” This unparalleled success was due to the efforts of Stan and his dedicated team of employees including Grammy Award-winning engineer, Larry Levine.
The innovations of Ross’s creative engineering methods and his unabashed charisma put Gold Star on the musical map as the studio where hits were made.. So, it wasn’t surprising when in 1958, a young producer by the name of Phil Spector came to their studio to record his first hit, “To Know Him is to Love Him” and never looked back. Gold Star's one-of-a-kind custom-designed echo chamber, combined with the genius of Spector and the creativity of Ross and Levine, brought to the world the now-famous “Wall of Sound.”
Gold Star’s existence spanned the four most important decades in American pop music, which included the turbulent 60’s, psychedelic 70’s, and into the 80’s when punk rockers paid homage to the studio that helped put “Rock and Roll” on the main stage.

The ability to weave a tale and take an individual to far off distant lands (and even some we've been familiarized with) is a skill that I've admired for many years and worked hard to garner the ability of performing.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Now, as for the campaign itself: I've had the opportunity to workshop this hour-long, full length piece in front of fairly large audience, as well as deliver a few shorter pieces from the production to smaller groups. All have been met with rousing vocal support and an overwhelming craving for more. Not just that. I've received the same response the world over: </p>
<p><b><i>""I have/know someone who needs to see/hear/read that.""</i></b></p>
<p>It's one thing to give compliment and acknowledge a person's artistic integrity or contribution... But, when you hear those words... when you've been told that your work NEEDS to be shared... you know that it's time to work HARDER. I always been taught ""You have not because you ask not"". Another way of putting it: ""Closed Mouths Don't Get Fed."" So, I open my mouth and ask you, the Reader, to become the Contributor and assist me in the furthering of my goal for this campaign: <b>to raise a minimum of $5,000.</b> It's with your assistance that <b>I hope to prepare this production for an official Chicago Mounting, as well as a flexible touring piece, giving me the ability to share the message of the production in a continual manner. </b>The Rough Breakdown of what these funds will achieve can be found below. But first, I want to introduce you to an idea that keeps me pursuing... <b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">"" Live in 3D: Desire, Drive &amp; Destiny""</b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As an Entertainer, this is one of my mantras.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">:</span></b><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>DESIRE </b>Inspires You... </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>DRIVE </b>Propels You... </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>DESTINY </b>Embraces You.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It's the combination of these three factors that led me to the overall initiation of this campaign. I have ONLY one <b>Desire</b>... and that's to continue to be an inspiration through the work that I have the good fortune of creating &amp; contributing my time to... And this production encompasses alot of that. The <b>Destiny </b>I see for this piece is to be able to openly tour it in large and small venues for the audiences that need to see it:  I want this piece to be seen in communities where the idea of being successful is clouded with the idea that ""making it"" in itself is nothing more than a dream deferred. That's where My <b>Drive </b>kicks into high gear... I want to be able to tell that young child whose been convinced that they are not talented... have no gifts... don't fit in.... and don't reflect the norm... that they, in fact, have talents, have gifts, are an individual and have more inside of them than they could ever imagine. I want to teach youth and young adults to tap into their inner voice and start following whatever dreams they are hot-wired for. I want people to learn to captain their own ships and to remind them, especially folks within the overpopulated, urban areas, that they have more worth than they give themselves credit for and deserve to be the successes they see when they look in the mirror, daydream of better and fall asleep at night. I believe this production has the ability to give that kind of hope back to the people... <b><i>All creeds, colors, religions and backgrounds.</i></b></span>

</ul>
<p>This is a rough breakdown of budgeted funds for not only the first production, but the continual production of this piece in many venues, large and small. Fund breakdowns have been determined through research of multiple venues around the Chicagoland area as well as the rates for rental vs ownership of equipment necessary for the mounting of the full length production. Commonly,  Renting equipment can be very costly, so my eye is set on ownership of all technical properties. My hope is that by alleviating all future rental costs, sans future venues, I'll be allowed more flexibility in the aspect of touring to various locations and mounting the story for multiple audiences. In the event that the minimal $5000 goal isn't reach, I will continue with the mission of mounting the piece within the perimeters of resources garnered and promotions thereof.</p>
<p>Any and all donations made will be recognized with a production credit in the playbill and on Social Media. Your name will be listed as a donor, based upon the level of your donation! You will also receive special, limited edition gifts for your generous contribution. (Please see the Perks for more information.)</p>

In this non-fictional, one man show, I've left no stone unturned. I cover the broad base of a lot of the expected subject matter... Danger. Drugs. Violence. But, more than that, the writing, and the delivery therein, keeps an inspired, hopeful stance, proving that adversity may alter us, but has no overall say on what we will become & what we can achieve as individuals, persistent to follow our dreams. Below, you'll find some of the promotional language of the piece and a more in-depth description of my background.

About The Production:




(From the Press Release)

Covered Music, it's journey you don't want to miss.

“We live in many worlds on a day to day basis... and our worlds vary depending on the scope through which we see and live our lives... created from the underlying fabric of the worlds we were delivered into and brought up in... This is the story of the start my world, my scope, some of my view on some of the things that have shaped me into the individual that I am today. Now, I was always taught that the truth will set you free so, as I hold you hostage for the next hour or so, you’ll hear all my truth... Whether you like it or not!”

About The Campaign:

Now, as for the campaign itself: I've had the opportunity to workshop this hour-long, full length piece in front of fairly large audience, as well as deliver a few shorter pieces from the production to smaller groups. All have been met with rousing vocal support and an overwhelming craving for more. Not just that. I've received the same response the world over: 
""I have/know someone who needs to see/hear/read that.""
It's one thing to give compliment and acknowledge a person's artistic integrity or contribution... But, when you hear those words... when you've been told that your work NEEDS to be shared... you know that it's time to work HARDER. I always been taught ""You have not because you ask not"". Another way of putting it: ""Closed Mouths Don't Get Fed."" So, I open my mouth and ask you, the Reader, to become the Contributor and assist me in the furthering of my goal for this campaign: to raise a minimum of $5,000. It's with your assistance that I hope to prepare this production for an official Chicago Mounting, as well as a flexible touring piece, giving me the ability to share the message of the production in a continual manner. The Rough Breakdown of what these funds will achieve can be found below. But first, I want to introduce you to an idea that keeps me pursuing... "" Live in 3D: Desire, Drive & Destiny""
As an Entertainer, this is one of my mantras.:


DESIRE Inspires You... DRIVE Propels You... DESTINY Embraces You.


It's the combination of these three factors that led me to the overall initiation of this campaign. I have ONLY one Desire... and that's to continue to be an inspiration through the work that I have the good fortune of creating & contributing my time to... And this production encompasses alot of that. The Destiny I see for this piece is to be able to openly tour it in large and small venues for the audiences that need to see it:  I want this piece to be seen in communities where the idea of being successful is clouded with the idea that ""making it"" in itself is nothing more than a dream deferred. That's where My Drive kicks into high gear... I want to be able to tell that young child whose been convinced that they are not talented... have no gifts... don't fit in.... and don't reflect the norm... that they, in fact, have talents, have gifts, are an individual and have more inside of them than they could ever imagine. I want to teach youth and young adults to tap into their inner voice and start following whatever dreams they are hot-wired for. I want people to learn to captain their own ships and to remind them, especially folks within the overpopulated, urban areas, that they have more worth than they give themselves credit for and deserve to be the successes they see when they look in the mirror, daydream of better and fall asleep at night. I believe this production has the ability to give that kind of hope back to the people... All creeds, colors, religions and backgrounds.


What We Need & What You Get
 Here are the specifics of where your money goes.
All Production Costs for the First Full Length Mounting of ""Til The World Blow Up: A South Side Love Story"" featuring all technical elements. Production Costs Include, but are not limited to:



Venue Rental for a minimum of Three Performances: $1250-$1500


Furnishing/Maintenance of Stage Properties (Props): $250


Furnishing/Maintenance of Proper Costuming: $500


Collapsible/Movable Set Design & Construction: $500-$1000


Multimedia Tools (Projectors, Add'l Tech  Equipment): $2500


Videographer for Documetation of Performance, used for Future Promotional Material


This is a rough breakdown of budgeted funds for not only the first production, but the continual production of this piece in many venues, large and small. Fund breakdowns have been determined through research of multiple venues around the Chicagoland area as well as the rates for rental vs ownership of equipment necessary for the mounting of the full length production. Commonly,  Renting equipment can be very costly, so my eye is set on ownership of all technical properties. My hope is that by alleviating all future rental costs, sans future venues, I'll be allowed more flexibility in the aspect of touring to various locations and mounting the story for multiple audiences. In the event that the minimal $5000 goal isn't reach, I will continue with the mission of mounting the piece within the perimeters of resources garnered and promotions thereof.
Any and all donations made will be recognized with a production credit in the playbill and on Social Media. Your name will be listed as a donor, based upon the level of your donation! You will also receive special, limited edition gifts for your generous contribution. (Please see the Perks for more information.)
   
Other Ways You Can Help

 I do understand that sometimes, people cannot contribute in a financial sense, but in sharing my vision, you are still a very important factor in this campaign. Many of you may have been present for the first workshop. Your support of the piece is crucially critical to its continuation. So, please, SHARE this campaign with friends and family. POST it in your social media outlets. TALK to people about the production and give feedback to those it may impact, including myself. You can also send people to my facebook business portal, driving folks to show their support of the entity. The more this piece and the home entity (Darius ""T.Q."" Colquitt & Company) are promoted, the more assistance we have the opportunity of receiving.

</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>Tellin’ Man </i>is a play written by Rudy Gray. It takes
place on a plantation and portrays a would be slave revolt that is averted
because the ""tellin’ man"" (one of the slaves working on the plantation) informs
the master of its impending occurrence before the actual event. The plantation
owner has in his employ a particularly cruel and adulterous overseer who
attempts to rectify the problem. It is
the actions of the overseer that brings to light the racial hatred and bigotry
that existed then and we still see remnants of today. Also experiencing financial difficulties, the plantation owner is faced with possibility of selling the plantation. A rescue
attempt disguised as a sale of the plantation ends in the death of the
overseer. The slaves conspiring to revolt escape and some slaves remain behind.
The play encompasses a full spectrum of
human emotions from love to hate and really exemplifies the triumph of the
human spirit. <br/></p>

</div><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Help Bring <i>Spamalot</i> to Tulsa!</b></p>
<p><b>Why We Need Your Help:</b></p>
<p>Theatre Pops was launched in 1989 and is an original member of SummerStage Tulsa. Our mission is to provide theatre by the community, for the community, while focusing on shows with great stories and strong messages. In June 2014, Theatre Pops earned its first Tulsa Award for Theatre Excellence (TATE) for its production of <i>Seminar</i> by Teresa Rebeck. We recently closed a critically lauded production of <i>August: Osage County</i> at the Tulsa Performing Arts Center.</p>
<p>We're always looking for shows that are different, exciting and new to our community. When we decided to venture into the wide world of musicals, we knew not just any show would do. It had to be funny, smart and something we haven't all seen a million times. In other words, it had to be <i>Spamalot</i>, a musical comedy ""lovingly ripped off from"" the 1975 film<i> Monty Python and the Holy Grail. </i></p>
<p>With your tax-deductible contribution, you will be helping Theatre Pops bring this hilarious, exciting and irreverent show to life. We believe that Tulsa, and Oklahoma, deserves the best community theatre around, and we swear by Excalibur that with your help, we will give the community we love the theatre it deserves! </p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></b></p>
<p>You may be wondering “Why do you need money and how will my donation be spent?” We need $5,000 to pay for some of the up-front costs. Musical theatre isn’t cheap, folks. And while we have been working diligently to secure the funding for the remainder of the production, your donation will ensure that <i>Spamalot</i> is secured and on its way to a theatre near you (The Tulsa Performing Arts Center)! Every dollar you donate towards our goal of $5,000 will go directly to paying for <i>Spamalot</i> up-front costs. Any funds raised in excess of our goal will be directly applied to other production costs. If we don’t reach our goal, your generous contribution will still go towards making the production that much better and never in the pockets of knaves or folks having coffee on the company dime.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We welcome the opportunity to partner with you in this community arts endeavor, realizing that a creative and thriving arts environment will produce citizens who are a transforming influence in their community and their world.  We’ve been building momentum season over season in bringing you innovative and exciting works of theatre.

<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Theatre Pops is dedicated to bringing professional-quality theatre to the Tulsa community. In keeping with this ideal, we're always looking for a challenge! <i>Spamalot</i> will be our very first musical, and we are delighted with our inaugural choice. </p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is funding. The up-front costs of producing a musical are extensive, from securing rights, to performance and rehearsal space, to securing the best creative minds for our team that Tulsa has to offer. We know that Tulsa has the talent and passion to make this project a success, and with funding secured, not even the Black Knight could stand in our way. </p>

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>The Rocky Horror Picture Show has
been a Cult Classic for decades, 2015 marking the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary
of the film’s release in 1975.  All
around the nation, and the world even, groups of people come together in a
theatrical setting and Shadowcast the film. 
What is “shadowcasting” you may ask? 
Well, to put it simply, people dress up as the actors in the film and
perform the alongside the film, shadowing the actors.  However, the fans of Rocky Horror have made
much more of it, creating an Audience Participation aspect to the experience,
where folks in the audience are given things to throw and prompted when to
throw them.  </p>
<p>We, the Unconventional Conventionists of Greensboro, NC, are
a RHPS shadowcast who celebrated our 3<sup>rd</sup> anniversary in January 2015.  Over the past three years, we had been
gathering props and costumes from all over the place, ranging from local thrift
shops to custom made costume pieces from both online and in-the-cast
seamstresses.  We have been building our
audience, working on our performances, building up our presence within the
community and making sure that the folks who pay to see us go home feeling good
about what they saw.  Almost all of our
funding as come out-of-pocket of the performers within the cast, up until
around June of 2014 when we acquired merchandise to sell at our shows.  Even still, with the selling of merch and
Prop Bags, everything we made went back into the show, either to replenish Prop
Bags or buy materials for props or costumes. 
Everything we have done has been purely volunteer work on the part of
the cast.  The only thing we get is the
joy of working together as a cast and performing for people who share a similar
passion: Rocky Horror Picture Show.  </p>
<p>Everything had been going great since we started, up until
the few weeks before our Anniversary show. 
At the end of 2014, we learned that the theater which used to house us,
formerly the Carousel Luxury Cinemas, was changing ownership and being
renovated.  We were all in a panic
because we did not know if our show was going to continue at the theater or
what was going to happen with our cast, we just knew that we would not let this
slow us down and tear us apart.  Weeks
passed until we finally received word from one of the managers of the theater
saying we were given the “Okay” to go ahead with our January shows as
scheduled.  We were all excited to
continue, but nervous, not knowing what to expect.  A few days before the show, we called the
theater to check on our props and costumes, which the old management had
allowed us to store in the theater.  The
new manager assured us that everything was fine. </p>
<p>The night of our Friday night show, we arrived early at the
theater, in case there were any issues. 
The theater had been going through many noticeable renovations in just
the lobby alone, and we knew more were to come. 
Upon arrival, we were mortified to find that our props and costumes had
been misplaced during the renovations.  The
managers searched the theaters, the upstairs areas, storage closets, even the
dumpsters outback, to no avail.  That
night, we performed our show with the props we had brought with us and the
lighting of 3 cell phone flashlights. However, it did not stop us from
performing. In fact, it fueled us to prove we are more than just our props and
costumes.  </p>
<p>In the following weeks, after meeting with the new theater
management, there was nothing that could be done about everything that had been
misplaced.  <br/>
</p><p><b>TL;DR: </b></p>
<p><b>All of our Props and
Costumes that we used to perform in our Rocky Horror Shadowcast were misplaced
and lost during theater renovations and we need help.</b></p>
<p>And that brings us here. 
</p>
<p><b>What We Need:</b></p>
<p>After assessing the items which were misplaced and their
value, we came up with over $1,600 worth of things which we had compiled over
the past 3 years.  We are basically
starting from scratch as a cast, except the only difference between now and 3
years ago is you—the Community. </p>
<p>Our goal for this funding campaign is <b>$2000 </b>so that we can try to replace the things which were taken and
also build onto that to make us a more “legit” cast.  All money donated to the cause will go
towards creating/buying costume pieces, such as our golden Space Suits, as seen
in the pictures, or the beautiful, yet short lived, Columbia Sequin Tail
Coat.  We will also be using funds to go
towards props which went missing, like our amazing “Sonic Transducer” Panel
Shower Curtain (also pictured).  Other
uses of the money will be to create new props that we had been planning, like a
foldable “Tank” prop to be used during the lab scenes, the Grandfather clock
from the Time Warp scene, and other props and costumes.  Basically, we will be using this to create a
better show for the audience.  </p>
<p>Absolutely none of the funding goes into anyone’s personal
pocket.  Everything we get from you guys,
even if we don’t reach our goal, will be used to replenish costumes and props
once had. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The impact of the success of this campaign would mean that
we could get our show back to where it was a lot faster with much less financial
stress put on the people within the cast. 
Without this campaign, our funding relies on the sales of Merchandise
and Prop Bags at our shows (and the contribution of dedicated cast members).  On average we make approximately $60 (on a
generous night) in sales, which puts at about $120 a month from sales
alone.  Donations would help us up those
numbers to get us back on our high-heeled feet faster.  </p>
<p>If you have seen one of our shows, then I would you could
attest to how much we enjoy the performance aspect and how much the audience
enjoys it.  Being able to afford our
props and costumes would allow us to focus more of our attention on the
performance aspect and cater to the audience each night, giving them a show
they paid for.  The more accurate and
well-performed the better.  We’ve got the
performance aspect down, we just need the screen-accuracy that every Rocky
Horror Shadowcast craves. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>One of the challenges of building our costumes
and props back up is that so much of our stuff we once had was thrifted.  Some of it was close to the screen-accurate
and others did just enough.  The issue
that we are going to run into is trying to find more semi-screen accurate props
and costumes.  In the Greensboro area
alone, there are many thrift shops which we can look through.  We just have to think about what can be used
“as is” and what needs to be worked on. 
Luckily, we have a few folks within the cast who are handy with needles
and can help us alter things we have bought using the funds.  </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Another major challenge is deciding what props
and costumes are more important and need to be found first.  As a cast, we discuss which costumes/props
are necessary to having a good performance and decide which pieces we need to
look for or have custom made.  We are
also open to feedback from our community members as to what they feel is the
most important aspect to making our show run and look better.  </p>
<p><b>Why should I fund this? </b></p>
<p>This is a community project that has been in the works since
2012.  We have come a long way since our
first show and we have had most of that noticeable progress ripped away from
us.  Any funding will help us to gain
that back and give our performance back to the community.  </p>
<p><b>How else can I help? </b></p>
<p>Advertising is always a thing we need help with, be it for
the campaign itself or our cast/show as a whole.  Sharing the campaign link on your Social
Media is a great way to help contribute, because even if you can’t, you might
know someone who can.  Sharing our
Facebook page is also a great way to help because it gets the word out that
there is an active cast in Greensboro, NC who performs on a regular, monthly
basis.  </p>
Another, more direct, way that you could help is
by donating your skills for sewing, building, acting, or anything that you
think could help. We are very receptive to people wanting to join our cast and

Everything matt<p></p></div>","Our Story
The Rocky Horror Picture Show has
been a Cult Classic for decades, 2015 marking the 40th anniversary
of the film’s release in 1975.  All
around the nation, and the world even, groups of people come together in a
theatrical setting and Shadowcast the film. 
What is “shadowcasting” you may ask? 
Well, to put it simply, people dress up as the actors in the film and
perform the alongside the film, shadowing the actors.  However, the fans of Rocky Horror have made
much more of it, creating an Audience Participation aspect to the experience,
where folks in the audience are given things to throw and prompted when to
throw them.  
We, the Unconventional Conventionists of Greensboro, NC, are
a RHPS shadowcast who celebrated our 3rd anniversary in January 2015.  Over the past three years, we had been
gathering props and costumes from all over the place, ranging from local thrift
shops to custom made costume pieces from both online and in-the-cast
seamstresses.  We have been building our
audience, working on our performances, building up our presence within the
community and making sure that the folks who pay to see us go home feeling good
about what they saw.  Almost all of our
funding as come out-of-pocket of the performers within the cast, up until
around June of 2014 when we acquired merchandise to sell at our shows.  Even still, with the selling of merch and
Prop Bags, everything we made went back into the show, either to replenish Prop
Bags or buy materials for props or costumes. 
Everything we have done has been purely volunteer work on the part of
the cast.  The only thing we get is the
joy of working together as a cast and performing for people who share a similar
passion: Rocky Horror Picture Show.  
Everything had been going great since we started, up until
the few weeks before our Anniversary show. 
At the end of 2014, we learned that the theater which used to house us,
formerly the Carousel Luxury Cinemas, was changing ownership and being
renovated.  We were all in a panic
because we did not know if our show was going to continue at the theater or
what was going to happen with our cast, we just knew that we would not let this
slow us down and tear us apart.  Weeks
passed until we finally received word from one of the managers of the theater
saying we were given the “Okay” to go ahead with our January shows as
scheduled.  We were all excited to
continue, but nervous, not knowing what to expect.  A few days before the show, we called the
theater to check on our props and costumes, which the old management had
allowed us to store in the theater.  The
new manager assured us that everything was fine. 
The night of our Friday night show, we arrived early at the
theater, in case there were any issues. 
The theater had been going through many noticeable renovations in just
the lobby alone, and we knew more were to come. 
Upon arrival, we were mortified to find that our props and costumes had
been misplaced during the renovations.  The
managers searched the theaters, the upstairs areas, storage closets, even the
dumpsters outback, to no avail.  That
night, we performed our show with the props we had brought with us and the
lighting of 3 cell phone flashlights. However, it did not stop us from
performing. In fact, it fueled us to prove we are more than just our props and
costumes.  
In the following weeks, after meeting with the new theater
management, there was nothing that could be done about everything that had been
misplaced.  
TL;DR: 
All of our Props and
Costumes that we used to perform in our Rocky Horror Shadowcast were misplaced
and lost during theater renovations and we need help.
And that brings us here. 

What We Need:
After assessing the items which were misplaced and their
value, we came up with over $1,600 worth of things which we had compiled over
the past 3 years.  We are basically
starting from scratch as a cast, except the only difference between now and 3
years ago is you—the Community. 
Our goal for this funding campaign is $2000 so that we can try to replace the things which were taken and
also build onto that to make us a more “legit” cast.  All money donated to the cause will go

Coat.  We will also be using funds to go
towards props which went missing, like our amazing “Sonic Transducer” Panel
Shower Curtain (also pictured).  Other
uses of the money will be to create new props that we had been planning, like a
foldable “Tank” prop to be used during the lab scenes, the Grandfather clock
from the Time Warp scene, and other props and costumes.  Basically, we will be using this to create a
better show for the audience.  
Absolutely none of the funding goes into anyone’s personal
pocket.  Everything we get from you guys,
even if we don’t reach our goal, will be used to replenish costumes and props
once had. 
The Impact
The impact of the success of this campaign would mean that
we could get our show back to where it was a lot faster with much less financial
stress put on the people within the cast.

generous night) in sales, which puts at about $120 a month from sales

five college students decide to hit the road for spring break, their
trip is perfectly lined from D.C. to L.A. In plain view, there are no
bumps in the road, no inclement weather, and no stopping for
directions. However, it’s difficult to notice how smooth the road
is when each of them has their own windy path to maneuver. Logan sees
the trip as an adventure, and hopes to make amends with Zach, who,
since high school, has become a completely different person. Zach
insists on bringing his girlfriend, Katie, along who is clueless
about Zach's past. Logan’s best friend Rose tries to keep
everything steady without worrying about her own problems, and Teddy,
well, is seemingly just along for the ride. After days of traveling,
reminiscing, and arguing, a sudden obstacle in the road forces the
friends to gain some perspective. They must keep traveling, and as
they move forward their trip becomes a lesson. The group may not know
exactly what direction they’re going, but at least the wheels are
turning. 
</i></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHEELS
WILL TURN</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>After
graduating college I found myself driving around in a white passenger
van for TheatreIV, a subdivision of Virginia Repertory Theatre that
mounts hour long theatrical spectaculars across the United States in
everywhere from elementary school cafeteriums  to large Renaissance
theatres. Being trapped in the cold tin walls of van can be daunting
if you don't have supportive and caring cast. Luckily I was able to
find Kelsey Fehlner in my passenger seat and a friendship was born.
After directing Kelsey Fehlner in Stage B Theatre Company's latest
production, Kelsey accepted a new tour offer while I took a job at
Richmond Triangle Players. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time
went by and more tours passed before Samuel Tolley and Kelsey came to
me with a proposal for  a thought provoking and exciting idea for a
musical they had been writing. Kelsey and Samuel had been toying
around with the idea of writing a new musical for some time, but the
wheels began to turn for the writing duo when Kelsey lost her
favorite stuffed animal during a trip on tour. During a drowsy,
late-night creative session an important question was posed: What if
we took the setting of  a cold, claustrophobic, cramped van and told
the story of high school friends reclaiming a part of their
childhood? With this idea a tale of love, a race for time, and an
adventure of friendship was born: Wheels Will Turn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What
you will witness opening night is a polished and fully realized
musical that is the result of a culmination of countless hours of
hard work. But it cannot be done without your help. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHY
DO WE NEED MONEY?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>It
goes without telling that production means a lot to each member
attached to the production. This is a world premiere musical and the
audience will be hearing this material for the first time. With hopes
of this being the first stop of a fantastic journey we anticipation
to take, we would consider this the first workshop production. We
want to shape and mold this production to be the very best it can be
with the resources and ideas that are given to us. With a heavy
mixture of dedication, hard work, passion, and real life events we
are all approaching this production with open minds letting the work
blossom into the garden it's meant to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mounting
a brand new theatrical production is a daunting and seemingly
impossible task. The risks are endless every step of the way and most
of the time we put our faith in the unknowing. Will the audience walk
out at intermission? Will a strong gust of wind in the theatre blow
the set over? Will the projector work the way we want it to every
performance? Will our microphones pop and buzz throughout the
production? The creative team can do everything in our power to
answer “NO!” to these questions but there will always be a factor
inexpediency. Actors might be forced to drop out, a winter storm
might bury the East Coast, someone might get an unforeseeable
illness, etc. With each dollar you donate you are closing the gap on
that inexpediency and helping us reach a finished and lustrous
production. We have the dates and the space and without a doubt the
production will occur. Because no matter what, the wheels continue to
turn. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ticket
sales rarely are able to fund theatrical productions nowadays based
upon the myriad reasons of economical downfall. Due to the
spontaneous nature of Stage B Theatre Company's productions in the
past we are left with a low budget and big dreams. While in the past,
Stage B has made little out of nothing we really do want to give this
production all we have. We have big plans for “Wheels Will Turn.”
For example, we have plans for  making a edited video of the full
production, a CD of the original performing cast, and many more
exciting things planned so please take the time to donate now! We
have many different perks that you will receive for any amount of
donation. Even donating just two dollars will give you access to our
behind the scenes blog. Feeling generous? For donating a whopping
thousand dollars you will receive a sponsorship credit for the

</p><p><b>STAGE
B THEATRE COMPANY</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>In
the fall of 2010, Tommy Callan and Lucian Restivo met with Graduate
student Justin Amellio in a small office on the Virginia Commonwealth
University campus. At first it was just an Advanced Directing class
in hopes to further their education but it soon came to fruition that
this class would mean more. Inspired by the words and wisdom of
Justin, Lucian and Tommy one day would hope to create their own work
as well as showcase the many talented friends. While the two
brainstormed, an idea formed. What started as mere coffee chatter
soon become constant conversation that led to bigger ideas. With idea
after idea flowing, it was hard to keep up. This dynamic duo needed
someone to level them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After
discussing company members and weighing their options, it was
concluded that Lisa Hardt was the best fit. With her stage managing
expertise and aspirations to be a future Production Manager, she was
asked to join the team. With an enthusiastic “yes,” this team was
pumped and roaring to go!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
first show came about through the ever-ticking clock of the duo's
senior year. With everyone moving away, Lucian strived to work with
his classmates as much as possible before parting to separate states.
Lucian approached Ashley Keeter about her undying love for Neil
LaBute in hopes that he could direct her in reasons to be pretty. It
was settled. The first show was set and it was on to creating the
rest of the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now
in our fourth year, we've been producing central new works as well as
regionally premieres centering with Generation Y issues. Stage B
Theatre Company was awarded with the 2012 Richmond Theatre Critic
Circle award Best Locally-Developed Work with our devised work “Brew:
Locally Grown Stories from Richmond's Coffee Community” by Ian Page
as well as produced “Peter Pan: The Boy Who Hated Mothers” by
Michael Lluberes in Chicago, IL directed by Josh Chenard. To learn
more about Stage B Theatre Company's past productions please visit

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In
Richmond, Virginia university theatre students are often left with a
loss of professional experience due to time constraints within their
curriculum and a lack of characters for their age range. Stage B has
been created to aid these students and other young actors as an
extension of university learning and as a stepping stone when they
approach the professional world. Lucian and Tommy fully believe it is
the right time and place to make a mark on the Richmond and Chicago
theatre scene. By creating Stage B Theatre Company, Lucian and Tommy
promise to approach shows with minimalism in mind, while still
producing quality theatre.</p>

</p> </div>","When
five college students decide to hit the road for spring break, their
trip is perfectly lined from D.C. to L.A. In plain view, there are no
bumps in the road, no inclement weather, and no stopping for
directions. However, it’s difficult to notice how smooth the road
is when each of them has their own windy path to maneuver. Logan sees
the trip as an adventure, and hopes to make amends with Zach, who,
since high school, has become a completely different person. Zach
insists on bringing his girlfriend, Katie, along who is clueless
about Zach's past. Logan’s best friend Rose tries to keep
everything steady without worrying about her own problems, and Teddy,
well, is seemingly just along for the ride. After days of traveling,
reminiscing, and arguing, a sudden obstacle in the road forces the
friends to gain some perspective. They must keep traveling, and as
they move forward their trip becomes a lesson. The group may not know
exactly what direction they’re going, but at least the wheels are
turning. 


WHEELS
WILL TURN

After
graduating college I found myself driving around in a white passenger
van for TheatreIV, a subdivision of Virginia Repertory Theatre that
mounts hour long theatrical spectaculars across the United States in
everywhere from elementary school cafeteriums  to large Renaissance
theatres. Being trapped in the cold tin walls of van can be daunting
if you don't have supportive and caring cast. Luckily I was able to
find Kelsey Fehlner in my passenger seat and a friendship was born.
After directing Kelsey Fehlner in Stage B Theatre Company's latest
production, Kelsey accepted a new tour offer while I took a job at
Richmond Triangle Players. 


Time
went by and more tours passed before Samuel Tolley and Kelsey came to
me with a proposal for  a thought provoking and exciting idea for a
musical they had been writing. Kelsey and Samuel had been toying
around with the idea of writing a new musical for some time, but the
wheels began to turn for the writing duo when Kelsey lost her
favorite stuffed animal during a trip on tour. During a drowsy,
late-night creative session an important question was posed: What if
we took the setting of  a cold, claustrophobic, cramped van and told
the story of high school friends reclaiming a part of their
childhood? With this idea a tale of love, a race for time, and an
adventure of friendship was born: Wheels Will Turn.

What
you will witness opening night is a polished and fully realized
musical that is the result of a culmination of countless hours of
hard work. But it cannot be done without your help. 


WHY
DO WE NEED MONEY?

It
goes without telling that production means a lot to each member
attached to the production. This is a world premiere musical and the
audience will be hearing this material for the first time. With hopes
of this being the first stop of a fantastic journey we anticipation
to take, we would consider this the first workshop production. We
want to shape and mold this production to be the very best it can be
with the resources and ideas that are given to us. With a heavy
mixture of dedication, hard work, passion, and real life events we
are all approaching this production with open minds letting the work
blossom into the garden it's meant to be.

Mounting
a brand new theatrical production is a daunting and seemingly
impossible task. The risks are endless every step of the way and most
of the time we put our faith in the unknowing. Will the audience walk
out at intermission? Will a strong gust of wind in the theatre blow
the set over? Will the projector work the way we want it to every
performance? Will our microphones pop and buzz throughout the
production? The creative team can do everything in our power to
answer “NO!” to these questions but there will always be a factor
inexpediency. Actors might be forced to drop out, a winter storm
might bury the East Coast, someone might get an unforeseeable
illness, etc. With each dollar you donate you are closing the gap on
that inexpediency and helping us reach a finished and lustrous
production. We have the dates and the space and without a doubt the
production will occur. Because no matter what, the wheels continue to
turn. 


Ticket
sales rarely are able to fund theatrical productions nowadays based
upon the myriad reasons of economical downfall. Due to the
spontaneous nature of Stage B Theatre Company's productions in the
past we are left with a low budget and big dreams. While in the past,
Stage B has made little out of nothing we really do want to give this
production all we have. We have big plans for “Wheels Will Turn.”
For example, we have plans for  making a edited video of the full
production, a CD of the original performing cast, and many more
exciting things planned so please take the time to donate now! We
have many different perks that you will receive for any amount of
donation. Even donating just two dollars will give you access to our
behind the scenes blog. Feeling generous? For donating a whopping
thousand dollars you will receive a sponsorship credit for the
production and several extra rewards all laid out on the perks page,
so check it out!

DID
YOU KNOW?



A
little under 30 percent of any donation will go to the technical
elements of the show?


22
percent of any donation will go towards the performers for the show
and 30 percent of your donation will go towards musicians?


Just
under 20 percent will go towards the promotional materials and
miscellaneous purchases throughout the production?



OTHER
WAYS TO HELP

We
understand. Times are tough and you don't have it in your budget to
throw money at us. There are other ways to help! Just simply sharing
our campaign or promotional materials on social media or by word of
mouth is fantastic. We'll also need plenty of volunteers to hang
posters, usher, work our box office, or even working on the
production! To volunteer or offer any help with the production shoot
us a message or email at stagebtheatrecompany@gmail.com. 



STAGE
B THEATRE COMPANY

In
the fall of 2010, Tommy Callan and Lucian Restivo met with Graduate
student Justin Amellio in a small office on the Virginia Commonwealth
University campus. At first it was just an Advanced Directing class
in hopes to further their education but it soon came to fruition that
this class would mean more. Inspired by the words and wisdom of
Justin, Lucian and Tommy one day would hope to create their own work
as well as showcase the many talented friends. While the two
brainstormed, an idea formed. What started as mere coffee chatter
soon become constant conversation that led to bigger ideas. With idea
after idea flowing, it was hard to keep up. This dynamic duo needed
someone to level them out.

After
discussing company members and weighing their options, it was
concluded that Lisa Hardt was the best fit. With her stage managing
expertise and aspirations to be a future Production Manager, she was
asked to join the team. With an enthusiastic “yes,” this team was
pumped and roaring to go!

The
first show came about through the ever-ticking clock of the duo's
senior year. With everyone moving away, Lucian strived to work with
his classmates as much as possible before parting to separate states.
Lucian approached Ashley Keeter about her undying love for Neil
LaBute in hopes that he could direct her in reasons to be pretty. It
was settled. The first show was set and it was on to creating the
rest of the company.

Now
in our fourth year, we've been producing central new works as well as
regionally premieres centering with Generation Y issues. Stage B
Theatre Company was awarded with the 2012 Richmond Theatre Critic
Circle award Best Locally-Developed Work with our devised work “Brew:
Locally Grown Stories from Richmond's Coffee Community” by Ian Page
as well as produced “Peter Pan: The Boy Who Hated Mothers” by
Michael Lluberes in Chicago, IL directed by Josh Chenard. To learn
more about Stage B Theatre Company's past productions please visit
our website at www.stage-b.org. 


In
Richmond, Virginia university theatre students are often left with a
loss of professional experience due to time constraints within their
curriculum and a lack of characters for their age range. Stage B has
been created to aid these students and other young actors as an
extension of university learning and as a stepping stone when they
approach the professional world. Lucian and Tommy fully believe it is
the right time and place to make a mark on the Richmond and Chicago
theatre scene. By creating Stage B Theatre Company, Lucian and Tommy
promise to approach shows with minimalism in mind, while still
producing quality theatre.

</h3> <p>Welcome to our IndieGogo Campaign for ""A Young Lady from Rwanda - A Play"" (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/YoungLadyFromRwanda"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/YoungLadyFromRwanda</a>)!</p>
<p>We have two actors and one director who are working very hard right now to memorize the script, and produce this wonderful play by Sonjia Linden. We find this work so powerful, so moving, and with current events where issues of social inequality and discrimination against race and gender crop up daily. We knew we had to produce this show of healing. <br/></p>
<p>Hence our tagline: ""Presenting a theatrical play to help heal the wounds of all genocide.""</p>
<p>This is not something that has just happened in Rwanda, or Bosnia, or Cambodia, or during the Holocaust. This is happening now. Out in the world, and where we live. We wanted to do something to make this more visible and we wanted to do something to help in the best way we know we can - through art.</p>
<p>We know that WE KNOW a lot of people in the New River Valley and Virginia who would want to see this show and help bring these issues to light and engage in conversations to heal our communities. We think our campaign, and this show, can do just that.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What do you want?</h3>
<p>We need $6000 to initially produce this show. This money will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase the rights for an initial 5 productions from Dramatic Publishing</li>
<li>Pay our cinematographer, who made our great IndieGogo campaign video!</li>
<li>Pay our director for her time in bringing these characters and their stories to life</li>
<li>Pay our actors who have donated their own time and money to work on, not just learning lines, but investing in the technical elements in the show</li>
<li>Tour the show - The New River Valley is a big place, with many venues ranging from 15 minutes to an hour away. We will need to be able to cover any gas and venue costs to bring this show to our community</li>
<li>Printing costs for our programs, promotional and educational materials<br/>
</li>
<li>Funding sister show, a reader's theatre piece entitled ""Upstanders"". We believe that reader's theatre is the key in attaining education and empathy with our audiences for this production and we would love to be able to offer this for free to anyone who will see our show.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>What will I get?<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have some great educational and promotional materials that we have developed along with this show, and we know, not everyone will do theatre for social justice, but there are a lot of folks who are interested in peace, social justice and global issues, let our work be your gain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every little bit helps, and we are grateful for every dollar, so for smaller donations, you will get things like immortal internet fame for backing our show! (Along with more tangible options like buttons and postcards featuring our logo.)<br/>
</li>
<li>As donation sizes increase, so do the rewards, we can offer posters and t-shirts, or a whole collection of promotional materials for you to own!</li>
<li>Another donation option is that we will help you produce ""Upstanders"" for your group! If you make a small donation, we can give you our work on the reader's theatre electronically, so you can do it at your own school, church, or other advocacy organization.

<li>Finally, you can bring a show to you, anywhere within 2-3 hours of driving time! For just $500 that will cover our production costs and you've allowed us to have a wider audience. We see this as the best win-win ever!<br/>

<h3>What will this do?</h3>In the New River Valley, there is a strange dichotomy to live theatre. It is always well attended and beloved, but never makes a huge profit to be fiscally viable by larger organizations. What this means is, a show with two actors don't amount much to a hill of beans in this crazy, mixed-up world.<br/><br/>But there are so many shows out there that are not children's shows, or murder mysteries, or comedies, or musicals, that can influence and change audiences. Shows that can open up dialogue in communities to make them better. Serious shows with small casts that audiences will want to see they just have to start somewhere.<br/><br/>We want this to start here and now. With your support, you are voting that we need this type of work and art in our community. You are saying you need us. We know we need you, but if you have always wanted to see or do this type of work, we critically need your support.<br/><br/>We will be able to use ""Young Lady From Rwanda"" as a launching pad for small, socially conscious theatre in the area, and we can cater to smaller audiences in smaller places. This cannot happen without direct community support. The city cannot do it, the state cannot do it, the schools cannot do it. ONLY. YOU. CAN.<br/><br/>We would love to take your hand in this exciting new partnership and have you run forward with us. Help us grow this small theatre movement in our area and produce a truly great show with some long-term New River Valley artists.

</div> <div> <h3>What if we fail?<br/>

<p>We know it won't be easy, but many of us have been doing theatre and making art in the New River Valley for many years now. We know what this community is like, because we live and work here, and because of that we know we will never be able to have actor or artist be our only profession. Those are the facts.<br/></p>
<p>But there IS community support. We have experienced that. And we know that if we do not produce theatre and art, it will not exist in this community. We have seen droves of neighbors just like you come out and support us. We are asking you to do that again.</p>

The focus of our work is firmly based in contemporary plays and physical theatre, as well as radical adaptations of classic writing. This year we are taking on two plays by Sarah Kane, Cleansed and Phaedra's Love, and we need your help to bring these shows to the Edinburgh Fringe festival.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;""><br/></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;""><b>SARAH KANE</b></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;"">Sarah Kane is easily one of the most influental playwrights of recent times. She studied drama at Bristol University, graduating in 1992, and went on to an MA course in playwriting at the University of Birmingham, led by playwright David Edgar. Her life and career was turbulent, and after finishing five plays and a short film, she committed suicide in 1999. Although celebrated across the world, her plays are not often staged in Britain. Fear No Colours identifies with the passionate way her plays approach universal themes such as love, sex, death and pain - both emotional and physical. The company draws on these themes in our aesthetic work, looking at ways to stage catastrophe through movement, technologically mediated performance and stylised representation.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;""><br/></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;""><b>WHY THESE TWO PLAYS</b></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal;"">Cleansed and Phaedra’s Love are Kane’s least performed plays in Britain. Both texts challenge their director and performers through ‘impossible’ stage directions, and pushes the limit of theatrical representation to the extreme.

The focus of our work is firmly based in contemporary plays and physical theatre, as well as radical adaptations of classic writing. This year we are taking on two plays by Sarah Kane, Cleansed and Phaedra's Love, and we need your help to bring these shows to the Edinburgh Fringe festival.SARAH KANESarah Kane is easily one of the most influental playwrights of recent times. She studied drama at Bristol University, graduating in 1992, and went on to an MA course in playwriting at the University of Birmingham, led by playwright David Edgar. Her life and career was turbulent, and after finishing five plays and a short film, she committed suicide in 1999. Although celebrated across the world, her plays are not often staged in Britain. Fear No Colours identifies with the passionate way her plays approach universal themes such as love, sex, death and pain - both emotional and physical. The company draws on these themes in our aesthetic work, looking at ways to stage catastrophe through movement, technologically mediated performance and stylised representation.WHY THESE TWO PLAYSCleansed and Phaedra’s Love are Kane’s least performed plays in Britain. Both texts challenge their director and performers through ‘impossible’ stage directions, and pushes the limit of theatrical representation to the extreme. Cleansed posed an exciting challenge to the company’s director Julia Midtgard, and after a successful directing exam presentation at the University of Glasgow we decided to challenge ourselves further by taking on Phaedra’s Love. Both plays expose the tragedies of characters who will do anything to stay in love, whatever the cost.It will be devastatingly hard work and the blood might not always be entirely fake, but we are hoping to be able to offer a truly experiential afternoon in the theatre.With 2015 marking the 20th anniversary of Kane's debut play Blasted, we feel this is the perfect time to immerse ourselves in the work of this extraordinary playwright.WHAT ARE THE SHOWS ABOUT?Cleansed:In a torture institution of the heart, seven lovers are faced with the impossible: love is indestructible and to stay in love, they must survive anything.Our main intentions with Cleansed are to explore the catastrophe and violence of love, as well as investigating ways of representing the 'impossible' stage directions in the play. We want to reach into the core of the play and attempt to bring the base conflict and themes of the text to the surface.What our audience said about Cleansed:'An engaging and affecting interpretation of the text''An extremely thoughtful and committed engagement with the material''A powerful, raw and fresh interpretation of Sarah Kane, which poignantly reaches the humanity of her work'Phaedra's Love:When queen Phaedra falls madly in love with her stepson Hippolytus, disaster is inevitable. The prince has no interest in anyone's affections, and his apathy soon throws the nation's morals into irreparable turmoil.Through a bold and passionate approach to the material we attempt to expose the pain of a love strong enough to cause catastrophe to an entire nation. By using movement and video, we are exploring how skin and flesh can be used as a visceral site of performance.

<p>Charity Clark-Anderson and Angela G. King first met as members of the all-female cast whose rendition of venerated author and playwright Pearl Cleage's <i>A Song for Coretta</i> was voted ""Best Play of the Season"" by the subscribers to the Detroit Repertory Theatre. From then on, the two would often bring up the possibility of starting a group to help nurture aspiring local playwrights whenever they would run into each other at various theater events. Leah Smith, marketing and development director for the Rep, eventually overheard just such a conversation and piped up, ""You can meet here!"" From that extraordinary proposition emerged The Detroit Playwrights' Lab (""The Lab"").</p>
<p>More than 20 individuals came out to Detroit's oldest professional theater on July 25, 2016, for the first-ever meeting that Clark-Anderson and King held for The Lab. Individuals who included nationally renowned local playwright and retired Wayne State University English professor, Bill Harris. And, by Skype from Los Angeles, author of the award-winning ""Detroit Project"" trilogy of plays highlighting her hometown, Dominique Morisseau.</p>
<p>Meeting every other Monday since then at either the Rep or office space provided by member Doreen McArthur, The Lab now counts the likes of Jeffry Chastang, author of <i>Dauphin Island</i>, the dramedy produced for the Rep's 2017-18 season to rave reviews, among its ranks. Clark-Anderson received an Audience Favorite nod for the one-act excerpt from her <i>Legacy</i> that was produced during Planet Ant Theatre's 2017 BoxFest Detroit festival. Member Collette Cullen's <i>The Encore</i> was a semifinalist in the 2018 Detroit New Works Festival. Her <i>Dressed to Kill, Dressed to Die</i> monologue is a finalist for the 2018 Women's Theatre Festival in Raleigh, North Carolina. And Emilio Rodriguez' <i>Swimming While Drowning</i> has been selected for the 2018-19 season of Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston.</p>
<p>The Lab is sustained not only in our mission as a forum for playwrights of varying levels to come together and hear their works read and critiqued. We also offer writing exercises, group theater outings and other related undertakings to help cultivate the full creative development of our members' unique individual voices. </p>
<p>Encouraged by the undeniable success of our first stage showcase in July 2017, The Lab will be joined by some of Metro Detroit's most promising stage directors and aspiring actors to present our upcoming sophomore showcase!</p>

And Emilio Rodriguez' Swimming While Drowning has been selected for the 2018-19 season of Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston.
The Lab is sustained not only in our mission as a forum for playwrights of varying levels to come together and hear their works read and critiqued. We also offer writing exercises, group theater outings and other related undertakings to help cultivate the full creative development of our members' unique individual voices. 
Encouraged by the undeniable success of our first stage showcase in July 2017, The Lab will be joined by some of Metro Detroit's most promising stage directors and aspiring actors to present our upcoming sophomore showcase!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Founded in 2017 by a group of dedicated artists, our professional theatre company strives to help increase the ever-growing interest for the arts in Vancouver. By producing gripping, contemporary theatre with a heavy focus on up-and-coming Canadian playwrights, we seek to reignite the community’s passion for live performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We believe that the theatre should be a place open to everyone and not only the rich and retired. Live performance is so important in our community, especially in the technological world that drives us and we want to give people the chance to see ground-breaking stories acted out on stage in front of them. Our goal is to produce high-quality, professional theatre while making it accessible to our community by keeping our ticket prices at $20.00.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>Our Artists</h3>
<p>The Vagrant Players theatre Society acts as a creative shelter for everyone regardless of race, gender, sexuality, and religious or political views; we welcome all artists who have a desire to bring important, impactful stories to the forefront of our community, and an audience that is eager to make that community a part of the North American theatre conversation.</p>
<p>Our team is led by creative directors Cody Kearsley (Riverdale, Power Rangers) and Megan Peta Hill (Supernatural, X-Files, The Magicians).</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to produce professional theatre we need funding for a variety of things, including: sets, theatre rental, artist fees, marketing and more. As a new company that has been around less than 2 years, it can be difficult to get certain grant funding and therefore have had to rely on donations from our community, fundraising and our own back pockets. We are looking to raise <u>$10,000</u> for us to achieve this goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2018/19 Season:</h3>
<p>KILL ALL POLITICIANS by Thomas Yungerberg   -  **Closed</p>
<p>Stu and Ben are bored, stoned, and spending another night inexpertly dissecting senatorial vote-trading when a parking ticket sends Stu over the edge. As he plots to rid America of political misbehaviour once and for all, Ben begins to wonder if his friend’s vehemence stems from problems closer to home.</p>
<p>FEATURING LORETTA by George F. Walker  -  **Opens August 6th, 2018</p>
<p>Loretta is the kind of girl you would do anything for. Dave and Michael are in love with her. Dave wants to take her shopping. Michael wants to make her a star! A porn star. What is a woman to do in a man’s world?</p>
<p>PRAIRIE LILY by Ryan Bruce  -  **Opens November, 2018</p>
<p>Written by up and coming playwright, Ryan Bruce, this play will explore the life of a small town, Canadian family in the prairies and their journey through family connection, self-medication and the cultural clash of our widely-diverse country.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a new theatre company that has been incorporated for less than two years, it can be difficult to receive government funding. Because we are trying to build the platform for edgy, hard-hitting contemporary plays in Vancouver, the support from our fellow creatives has been incredible. Our first season was completely funded by ourselves and like-minded artists giving us the building blocks of our society. As our company builds, almost to the point of getting support from various arts councils, we find ourselves needing to reach out to our community to ask for support.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have a passion for live performance but are unable to financially contribute, we are always looking for volunteers to help with upcoming productions and events. Please email us at vagrantplayers@gmail.com for more information.</p>

<h3><i>Lora, an incarcerated woman in solitary confinement reflects on the circumstances that have brought her there. Far more complex than “I committed a crime and am guilty”, the story she unravels is a hapless history… one laced with violence, betrayal, heartbreak, and regret.</i></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About the Project:</h3>
<p><i>Caged</i> is a brand new play that, unfortunately, is based on a true story. Not (just) events from my own life, but experiences from the lives of tens of thousands of women around the world.</p>
<p>The narrative deals with some heavy topics: murder, domestic violence, judicial abuse of power, even animal neglect. It doesn't shy away from these things or make light of them, nor does it excuse them or soften them. Instead, it provides a candid, first-person point of view as to how easily anyone's life can veer wildly off-course. People like you and me. Like our sisters, girlfriends, best friends, daughters, and mothers. </p>
<p>Despite her circumstances, the character of Lora is written not as a sad victim, but as an intelligent woman. A smart observationalist with an off-the-cuff and blunt point of view, who tells it how it is, and who owns her past experiences. The language and story of <i>Caged</i> is all very real, very accessible. And, as previously mentioned, the story is 100% grounded in real-life events.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, producing a Fringe show comes with no guarantees. Audiences could love my show and it could sell out, or I could find myself playing to a house of less than ten audience members.</p>
<p>What I'm asking for is help covering a portion of my out of pocket costs. This doesn't cover any of my time in researching, writing or rehearsing the show, only what I am actively spending to bring this show to PEI.</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 - plane fare to PEI</li>
<li>$250 - Fringe entry fee</li>
<li>$250 - cost of hiring a stage manager</li>
<li>$50 - wardrobe</li>
<li>$100 - printing costs for flyers and posters</li>
<li>$100 - estimated Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Any money donated here will go toward helping me break even on this production. Should I generate a profit with this show, that money will go toward helping me bring <i>Caged</i> to other venues in other cities, to other folks who need to see the show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Put simply, theatre is a tool that allows us to create a comfortable and safe space to explore situations where people may feel uncomfortable and unsafe.</p>
<p>My hope with this show is to make a much larger audience aware of the small, private crimes that happen every day between people, the ones that aren't publicized in the news. To make people think about others' lived experience when it seems so drastically different from their own... even if it's not. To help people recognize and unlearn harmful patterns in their own lives. And beyond that, to start a serious discussion about judicial reform, which we so desperately need.</p>
<p>My last Indiegogo campaign resulted in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LifeandtheArtofLying/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an award-winning 26 minute short film</a> that has now screened at close to ten festivals. I've already proven that I can do a lot with a little... and now I'd like to do something amazing and fantastic with a reasonable amount. Launching this campaign is step one of that plan.</p>

<p>We need your help to put on an amazing performance. </p>
<p>70 years ago a psychologist became famous for his day-in-the-life study of a seven year-old boy.

<p>It's also expensive. We're producing a week-long run of performances in June 2018. It may not seem like much, but even a small theatre production takes a big team.

I knew the title. I knew I wanted to take a deep, soul level look at the Black American experience. I instinctively knew this was not a play that I wanted to approach how I’d approached others. I wanted the words to come from an excavation, an emotional exploration. I wanted them to erupt from the deep sense of outrage and sorrow I was feeling about Eric Garner, Mike Brown, and then there was Lennon Lacy. Lennon was a Black boy of 17 found hung by a belt under suspicious circumstances in Bladenboro NC, just a three hour straight drive from where I’d raised my own Black son. This modern day lynching, the lynchings of the past, and the trend of devaluing and desecrating of Black bodies instilled in me the desire to create something an audience could feel, for it is at the level of emotion that change is generated.

He and She, spellbound and enlightened by the power of Gyp's magic, succumb to their truth and ultimately accept their part in the cyclical madness of The Station.The Danger will have a six performance showcase run October 4 - 6 & 11 - 13 at JACK in Brooklyn, NY.The TeamWritten  by Stacey RoseDirected by  Tiffany Nichole GreeneMusic Supervision by  Elijah Caldwell​Assistant Director Heidi BreedenProducer: Stacey RoseGraphics: Danielle Brockington, Marcus Kiser Videography: Danielle Brockington What your money will help us doWithout your support this project will not be possible.

<p>I'm Jenifer Toksvig, and I'm directing a workshop of a new piece of community musical theatre written by my friend Niall Ashdown.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The story is told around the first world war poems of A.E. Housman, set to music very beautifully by Niall.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We've received a Grants For The Arts grant from Arts Council England for this development process, which is brilliant. It will pay for us to do a two-week R&amp;D workshop on the show.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During that workshop, I'd like to include two kinds of R&amp;D on my own process for making work, and that's what this crowd-funding appeal is all about.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>1. Archivist</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I'd like to have someone in the room with us whose purpose is to capture the process of the workshop and the final presentations. The Archivist will make process notes and observations on brown paper on a wall, where everyone can see them, and encourage the rest of us to do the same when we want to capture things. The Archivist will also take photos and video of the process, and upload them to social media as we go. The notes, photos, videos, and anything else they capture, will then form part of our evaluation of the workshop, both for ACE and for us as a company.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Having an Archivist present means we can continuously embrace the objective view, not only as part of the making process, but also as part of performing the show. I imagine we will find that their job is part capture and part critic: having someone do this job for two weeks will allow us to explore what the job actually involves, and how best to facilitate it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>2. Responders</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I would like to invite a series of creative practitioners into the process for a day each, to spend some time responding to the us and the work we're making, in their own unique medium.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If we achieve our funding goal here, then we'll be able to invite multiple people to join us, and hopefully that will at least be: a painter/illustrator; a poet/writer; a paper/fabric crafter; a fragrance designer; a game maker.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>These responses in alternative media will be displayed throughout the process and performances, becoming as much part of the work as any other, and adding an additional way to access the work, for the company and the audience.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Having Responders in the process will reflect back to us that we are all doing exactly that: responding to the work as artists, and also as audience members. Since my goal is ultimately to encourage contact between the audience and the characters, I hope that the artists can act as intermediaries and help to make connections as they work.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>IndieGoGo will allow us to keep any monies we raise, so our individual goals go up in £90 / day increments. The more lots of £90 we get, the more days in which we can have an Archivist and a Responder in the room during our two week period. It would be absolutely fantastic if we could have them present all the way through, to really explore what we can achieve.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Any help you can give us, no matter how small, will go towards making more discoveries about 'The Copenhagen Interpretation' method of engaging in the making of work, and involving audiences in the story.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hot on the heels of their smash hit touring production of AS YOU LIKE IT, the newly-minted Rogue Ensemble Theater Company is set to tackle Shakespeare's most violent tragedy, TITUS ANDRONICUS. Adapted by Rogue Ensemble Artistic Director Christine Reisig and directed by Joey Nasta, this new socially-distant production reimagines the Bard's bloodiest tale as a macabre, ghostly requiem on the horror of revenge.</p>
<p>Performed at the steps of General Ulysses S. Grant's tomb, TITUS channels a corrupt, crumbling republic haunted by the ghosts of its failed caretakers. As the violent demon of revenge wreaks havoc in Rome, characters slowly forget themselves, changing from face to face until the carnage leaves little to be recognized.</p>

<p>KATY HAGELIN dance project is a contemporary ballet dance company in the Seattle area and we are fundraising for EXPOSURE 2017. Our goal is to raise $13,000 and we could use any support in this campaign -even if it is only a few dollars! We could use even  $2 or $5 donation!</p>
<p>Our mission is to enrich people's lives through the language of dance. We believe in speaking to audiences of all backgrounds and we want people to -not only enjoy the show, but also to understand and comprehend the message and stories. Some modern dance is not easy to grasp, but our company strives to really connect with our audience; we want people to go away excited and with hope for change in their own lives. Our dances are meant to be compelling and tell stories that invoke a passion that the choreographers want to share. These messages are ones of hope for life and community. Sometimes we perform for underprivileged audiences as well (like nursing-homes, hospitals and prisons) but if we can't to go them, we offer discounts for students and others who would not normally be able to afford a dance show. KHDP also has a mission to contribute to the dance world and the arts by working with the dancers and choreographers themselves and creating relationships with the dance community.</p>
<p>Donating to KHDP will not only help us cover our costs, but you will be contributing to the outreach ministry of KHDP Company and its dedicated members. Our mission is bigger than simply dancing -although we will surely be dancing!</p>
<p>KATY HAGELIN dance project Co. will present EXPOSURE 2017, an evening presenting contemporary ballet and modern dance pieces by four choreographers: Megan Becker, Victoria Gutierrez, Wade Walthall -restaged by Rachel Gonsalves and Katy Hagelin. 3 pieces will be world premiers and 2 will be reptertoire.</p>
<p>EXPOSURE will be presented on September 8th, 9th and 10th 2017 at 8:00pm each evening at Everett PUD Auditorium. It is a contemporary ballet and modern dance show where four choreographers and ten company dancers will present work exploring imbalances within society and offer ideas, hope and empowerment for change. The goal is to not only ""expose"" truth and hope about what we examine, but we also desire to place ourselves within our community and become ""exposed"" ourselves -revealing what is inside our own hearts desires and struggles as human beings. We want our audiences to leave the show informed and encouraged to continue to making positive changes in the world around them. We feel as artists, it is important to expose what our culture is dealing with in regards to this current day and age. It is one of our goals to translate truths and make present history more understandable.</p>
<p>$13,000 is our goal and the breakdown involves costs such as:</p>
<p>Theatre $2500, Dancer stipends $5K-$7K, Stage Managers/other technicians $500+, Marketing $300-$500, Insurance $350-$400, Costumes/shoes $700+, Rehearsal space $500+, Other misc: Ticket stubs, Tape, Supplies, Rent Projector, Flowers/gifts, and much more.. that adds up!</p>
<p>Our tickets sales usually only produce around 2,000$ as attendance is not in the hundreds. A good sized audience for KHDP would be between 50-100, although we would want and encourage hundreds. If we market well, we may be able to cover the costs of the theatre with the ticket sales. We don't expect that we can raise all of our money on our campaign here, but we hope to raise possibly 10K at least in donations, so that our ticket sales cover the rest. Any extra will probably honestly not even be ""extra"" but will go as a stipend to some of our workers (like videographer, costume designer/taylor, stage manager, music editor and more) who have already donated their time to us.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions regarding costs! You can also visit our website at <a href=""http://www.katyhagelindanceproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.katyhagelindanceproject.org</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if you are able to give $2 or $5, that would be such a huge contribution! Anything can help!</p>
<p>We appreciate your support so much and would love to also see you at the show.</p>

We feel as artists, it is important to expose what our culture is dealing with in regards to this current day and age. It is one of our goals to translate truths and make present history more understandable.
$13,000 is our goal and the breakdown involves costs such as:
Theatre $2500, Dancer stipends $5K-$7K, Stage Managers/other technicians $500+, Marketing $300-$500, Insurance $350-$400, Costumes/shoes $700+, Rehearsal space $500+, Other misc: Ticket stubs, Tape, Supplies, Rent Projector, Flowers/gifts, and much more.. that adds up!
Our tickets sales usually only produce around 2,000$ as attendance is not in the hundreds. A good sized audience for KHDP would be between 50-100, although we would want and encourage hundreds. If we market well, we may be able to cover the costs of the theatre with the ticket sales. We don't expect that we can raise all of our money on our campaign here, but we hope to raise possibly 10K at least in donations, so that our ticket sales cover the rest. Any extra will probably honestly not even be ""extra"" but will go as a stipend to some of our workers (like videographer, costume designer/taylor, stage manager, music editor and more) who have already donated their time to us.
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding costs! You can also visit our website at www.katyhagelindanceproject.org!
 
Even if you are able to give $2 or $5, that would be such a huge contribution! Anything can help!
We appreciate your support so much and would love to also see you at the show.

<h3><strong>About us</strong></h3>
<p>After relocating from Los Angeles in the fall of 2017, we found that the Portland dance community was teeming with potential and we were eager to join the erupting scene. As we immersed ourselves further in the community, we noticed many dance and movement based spaces in the city were closing. We also noticed an influx of hungry dancers from across the country. Considering those two pieces of information, we decided the next thing on our agenda would be to open a space welcoming all ages and abilities. </p>
<p>Floor aims to foster a creative environment that pushes the boundaries of contemporary dance. We strive to enrich Portland’s dance scene by supporting the city’s rapidly growing dance community and will welcome national and international dance artists to create in our space. We will engage and educate the community and make viewing and participating in dance more accessible. Our schedule offers a wide range of styles and technical foundation for all ages, levels and abilities. We will provide consistent performance opportunities to our students, along with local and visiting artists of varying modalities. Floor is a place to discover, nurture and reconnect to the passion of movement and physical expression.</p>
<p>With your contribution, we will be able to bring the Portland dance community a high quality movement facility with the capability of providing space to train, create, and perform. </p>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The Regular Theatre is a non-profit theatre ensemble, founded in 2017 by friends and students then attending Xavier University. We strive to create opportunities for local artists and new friends to work on engaging and relevant projects that speak to a diverse audience of regular people.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Season</h2>
<p>This season, our goal is to challenge both our audiences and ourselves by producing work that is complex, thoughtful, and daring. As young artists, we believe that we can bring a unique perspective to our audiences.</p>
<p>This season's productions include:</p>
<p>Edward Albee's <i>The Zoo Story</i>, directed by Hannah Sgambellone, starring Micah Price and Sam Martini</p>
<p>Rajiv Joseph's <i>Gruesome Playground Injuries</i>, directed by Kyle Daniels</p>
<p>Maxim Vinogradov's <i>A Night of Stars With Tennessee Williams, </i>a regional premiere directed by Ellie Conniff</p>
<p>Arthur Miller's <i>The Crucible</i>, directed by Hannah Sgambellone</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>The Regular Theatre seeks to create work that broadens the scope of the Cincinnati theatre scene, as well as makes the arts accessible for a diverse audience. We pride ourselves on being a community-based organization that has found success in past productions through the collaboration of many fellow artists, friends, sponsors, and patrons. What we do is not possible without the support of our community.</p>
<p>With this year's season, our goal is to raise $3000 to cover the cost of productions, from obtaining rights to building sets, as well as being to pay our actors, designers, and other collaborators for all of the hard work they do. No contribution is too small, and any contribution is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>

<strong>fabe Dance -Drugs Can't Buy premiere</strong> </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Mallory Fabian and I am the Artistic Director of fabe Dance. fabe is nearing the end of our second year with our 3rd evening length work Drugs Can’t Buy premiering at Highways Performance Space on October 11 &amp; 12. In two years fabe has performed in 7 dance festivals, taught masterclasses, workshops, have performed in over 10 venues in Los Angeles, and we're just getting started! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Get to know fabe Dance! </h3>
<p>With fabe, I want to help change the way audience members witness dance. I am most interested in work that creates a space for a performer to be seen as extraordinarily human. My goal is to achieve real and raw emotion on stage that comes from pushing through exhaustion and emotional turmoil in a meditative state. My work is feminine conscious, explores dry humor, and is generationally specific. The performers are real and present, just as audience members are, inherently aware and thinking through every movement, otherwise the work is flat and artificial.</p>
<p>Drugs Can’t Buy is a new, dark, and deeply personal dance-theatre work exploring what love can do to someone. </p>
<p>I am looking to raise funds for the extremely talented collaborators working on this project with me. These collaborators, designers, performers, my support system have been working very hard on this project for months and they deserve to get paid a lot more than anyone can provide them. </p>
<p>Making work in Los Angeles is hard, exciting, and I will continue to bring my audience fresh, fun, thought provoking, unimaginative work. I am dedicated to my practice as an art maker and dancer and I cannot do it without your support. If you decide to fund this project not only will you be supporting my collaborators, you will be contributing to keeping art alive in Los Angeles. </p>
<p> We would not survive without your continued support. Thank you so much for everything you've already done and continue to do. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With this campaign we are asking you to help us raise $5,500 to support the creation and performance of Drugs Can’t Buy. This campaign isn’t anywhere near the amount it will take to put on this show. Along with artist compensation for the rest of this project, not including what has already been paid, plus scenic design elements, costumes, technical elements, administrative support, etc, we budgeted for this show to cost over $20,000. I am very dedicated to bringing a world into the theatre the second the audience walks through the door. I’m from Las Vegas... so I’ve definitely seen and have been inspired by what shows there do. We are interested in creating that world but it takes funds beyond my support to achieve. Your donations will directly help the artists working on this show and making that world for you possible. </p>
<p>We want to give you some fun things for your contributions! No donation is too small. For just $1 you can get fabe to do a 30 second jam sesh in one of our rehearsals in honor of your donation. For just a little more we will post videos of us improvising on our story to say thank you to you. You can get a sneak peak of a music track we are using for our show with a little background on why we’re using it for $50. You can potentially get a print that was drawn by Sam Maurer in the making of our newest film “altered/seen”. Some donations even come with a gift bag of many treats. For $1000 Tom E Kelley will create a small replica of a music box we will be using in the show! </p>
<p>We want you to have all of these things as a tiny gesture for what you make possible. We cannot thank you enough! </p>

My name is Mallory Fabian and I am the Artistic Director of fabe Dance. fabe is nearing the end of our second year with our 3rd evening length work Drugs Can’t Buy premiering at Highways Performance Space on October 11 & 12. In two years fabe has performed in 7 dance festivals, taught masterclasses, workshops, have performed in over 10 venues in Los Angeles, and we're just getting started! 
 
Get to know fabe Dance! 
With fabe, I want to help change the way audience members witness dance. I am most interested in work that creates a space for a performer to be seen as extraordinarily human. My goal is to achieve real and raw emotion on stage that comes from pushing through exhaustion and emotional turmoil in a meditative state. My work is feminine conscious, explores dry humor, and is generationally specific. The performers are real and present, just as audience members are, inherently aware and thinking through every movement, otherwise the work is flat and artificial.
Drugs Can’t Buy is a new, dark, and deeply personal dance-theatre work exploring what love can do to someone. 
I am looking to raise funds for the extremely talented collaborators working on this project with me. These collaborators, designers, performers, my support system have been working very hard on this project for months and they deserve to get paid a lot more than anyone can provide them. 
Making work in Los Angeles is hard, exciting, and I will continue to bring my audience fresh, fun, thought provoking, unimaginative work. I am dedicated to my practice as an art maker and dancer and I cannot do it without your support. If you decide to fund this project not only will you be supporting my collaborators, you will be contributing to keeping art alive in Los Angeles. 
 We would not survive without your continued support. Thank you so much for everything you've already done and continue to do.

<p>Along with my co-producing partner, Mark Sutherland, and the rest of our team, we are asking for your help with our next project, <i>A Kid Like Jake</i> by Daniel Pearle, opening on April 23, 2020 at the PAL Studio Theatre in Vancouver.</p>
<p><u><strong>About the Play: <i>A Kid Like Jake</i> by Daniel Pearle </strong></u></p>
<p><i>A Kid Like Jake</i> is about a mother and father trying to do right by their 4-year-old son, Jake, who from an early age shows signs of gender-variant behaviour that becomes highlighted during the process of applying to private schools in New York. Although this play is about Jake, we never actually meet him onstage. Instead, we hear the way Jake is described by his teachers, and experienced by his parents, and from this it becomes clear that Jake doesn’t fit into the gender binaries that are the constructs of the worlds his parents grew up in.</p>

<p>Queer stories told through the lens of the parents and extended community of a gender-creative child are rare. So at a time when transgender rights and issues are making headlines in the news, <strong>this play can help to shoulder the burden of explanation, education, and relationship reconstruction between the queer community and their families. We see the theatrical setting</strong> as an ideal place of congregation for the LGBTQ2S+ community, and their allies. It can be a place of exploration and healing: <strong>a safe place to begin to confront one’s own relationship to their gender, their self, their partner(s), and their children, in a way that places the responsibility on the ally to ask themselves the hard questions, and seek answers.</strong> </p>
<p>Our venue, the <a href=""http://www.palstudiotheatre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PAL Studio Theatre</a>, is located on the 8th floor of the Performing Arts Lodges (PAL Vancouver), a unique social housing and theatre complex providing aging performing artists and those with disabilities the space and community they need to stay creative and engaged. <strong>Rental of this space plus $1 from each ticket sold goes to PAL and helps subsidize the living costs for their residents.</strong></p>

<p><u><strong>Our Personal Connection</strong></u><br/>For Stefania, who grew up in a traditional Italian family with a brother who would later come out as gay, and Mark, who is a gay male, the story of <i>A Kid Like Jake</i> resonated on many levels - primarily how the “coming-out” process can affect the parent-child relationship. While parents are always trying their best to do the right thing by protecting their children from a world that can be cruel towards people who don’t appear to be normal, their actions and choices may not be the right thing for that child. As with our experiences, the characters of <i>A Kid Like Jake</i> are forced to examine their beliefs and values while being constrained by the system for which they have been cultured. The intersection of these themes within the context of <i>A Kid Like Jake</i> is powerful, beautiful and at times devastating. <i><strong>This play has the potential to spark dialogue between audience members, their families and communities in the hope of helping us to love each other unconditionally.</strong></i></p>

<p><u><strong>The impact of your contribution</strong></u></p>
</div><div>
<p>As an independent actor-run theatre company, the reality of producing in today's artistic climate calls on producers to take on a significant amount of financial risk. <strong>With this risk comes the potential for immeasurable artistic rewards, and a great impact on the health of the community we are serving.</strong> As an independent company that functions in the vein of a not-for-profit organization, we have the freedom to choose the kind of work that we would like to produce, but the avenues by which we might obtain funding are slightly out of reach. As a young company, we are still working towards not-for-profit status, and as such, we are dependent upon friends, family, colleagues, and referrals, for the majority of our fundraising. </p>
<p><u><strong>Where is your contribution is going</strong></u></p>
<p>To give you an idea of our expenses (without putting you through the process of reading a spreadsheet), we are responsible for all costs associated with:<strong> the venue; staffing the venue; insurance for the venue; the licensing of the play; the licensing of the bar; paying our artists and creative team <i>something</i>; marketing; publicity; advertising; rehearsal space; printing fees, etc. The larger companies in town have entire departments devoted to all of these jobs. <u>As a small independent company, you basically have to do it all. </u></strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary!</h3>
<p>Something For The Buoys: A New Musical Comedy! Has had two sold out staged readings and is now ready to be produced! With book, music and Lyrics by Eli Pasic, this parody of nautical musical comedies of the 1930s is guaranteed to entertain!</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong><br/>A starry-eyed sailor named Jimmy feels lonely and wants nothing more than to find his true love. Accompanied by Larry, his womanizing best pal, he sneaks ashore and enters the wonderful world of New York City. Of course, Jimmy immediately stumbles upon his true love. But between a big-time Broadway offer and a cranky captain with an Alka- Seltzer addiction, will Jimmy sail into the sun and live happily ever after before the final curtain? Who knows!</p>
<p><strong><u>A bit about us:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>ELI PASIC</strong> is a playwright, screenwriter, and book writer/composer-lyricist of musical comedies. He studied piano and composition at Berklee College Of Music and was mentored by Broadway orchestrator Larry Blank as well as Broadway conductor Eric Stern. He’s been involved in countless productions as a rehearsal pianist and pit musician, and he’s a ubiquitous performer on the Toronto jazz scene. He recently wrote the book and lyrics to a new musical comedy with composer Henry Krieger (co-author of “Dreamgirls” and “Side Show”), which has been published by Broadway Licensing. If show business fails, he will move to Greece and become a dairy farmer.</p>
<p><strong>ROBERTO</strong> <strong>SAPIENZA</strong> is an actor, musician, director, producer, writer and Co-Founder of Sapling. He graduated from the Randolph College of Performing Arts in 2016 and has been working consistently in theatre since. Some of his recent credits include: Davey in <i>Newsies, </i>Lefou in <i>Beauty and the Beast, </i>Jake Laurents (George Bailey) in <i>It's A Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play </i>and Chef Pisghetti in <i>Curious George and the Golden Meatball. </i>He played <i>Jimmy </i>in the second staged reading of <i>Something For The Buoys.</i> He will also be making his directorial debut this summer in the Toronto Fringe Festival for <i>Tales Of A Cocktail </i>by Breakaway Entertainment. </p>
<p><strong>BRYAN KLING </strong>has been working in theatre and pushing himself as a singer and an actor since his graduation from the Randolph College for Performing Arts in 2014. Since first endeavoring into this industry, Bryan dreamed of one day running a production company of his own. He is absolutely thrilled to present this next step forward for both himself and the industry that has continuously brought him so much joy.</p>
<h2><strong>OUR CAMPAIGN!</strong></h2>
<p>We started our journey with what we know best — Theatre. Not only is this show close to our hearts, but it is a huge stepping stone towards Saplings future. Our goal, however, is to expand into a hub for all forms of artistry. We can't give away all of our ideas just yet..but trust us when we say our vision is clear and our plans are set. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary!
Something For The Buoys: A New Musical Comedy! Has had two sold out staged readings and is now ready to be produced! With book, music and Lyrics by Eli Pasic, this parody of nautical musical comedies of the 1930s is guaranteed to entertain!
SYNOPSISA starry-eyed sailor named Jimmy feels lonely and wants nothing more than to find his true love. Accompanied by Larry, his womanizing best pal, he sneaks ashore and enters the wonderful world of New York City. Of course, Jimmy immediately stumbles upon his true love. But between a big-time Broadway offer and a cranky captain with an Alka- Seltzer addiction, will Jimmy sail into the sun and live happily ever after before the final curtain? Who knows!
A bit about us:
ELI PASIC is a playwright, screenwriter, and book writer/composer-lyricist of musical comedies. He studied piano and composition at Berklee College Of Music and was mentored by Broadway orchestrator Larry Blank as well as Broadway conductor Eric Stern. He’s been involved in countless productions as a rehearsal pianist and pit musician, and he’s a ubiquitous performer on the Toronto jazz scene. He recently wrote the book and lyrics to a new musical comedy with composer Henry Krieger (co-author of “Dreamgirls” and “Side Show”), which has been published by Broadway Licensing. If show business fails, he will move to Greece and become a dairy farmer.
ROBERTO SAPIENZA is an actor, musician, director, producer, writer and Co-Founder of Sapling. He graduated from the Randolph College of Performing Arts in 2016 and has been working consistently in theatre since. Some of his recent credits include: Davey in Newsies, Lefou in Beauty and the Beast, Jake Laurents (George Bailey) in It's A Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play and Chef Pisghetti in Curious George and the Golden Meatball. He played Jimmy in the second staged reading of Something For The Buoys. He will also be making his directorial debut this summer in the Toronto Fringe Festival for Tales Of A Cocktail by Breakaway Entertainment. 
BRYAN KLING has been working in theatre and pushing himself as a singer and an actor since his graduation from the Randolph College for Performing Arts in 2014. Since first endeavoring into this industry, Bryan dreamed of one day running a production company of his own. He is absolutely thrilled to present this next step forward for both himself and the industry that has continuously brought him so much joy.
OUR CAMPAIGN!
We started our journey with what we know best — Theatre. Not only is this show close to our hearts, but it is a huge stepping stone towards Saplings future. Our goal, however, is to expand into a hub for all forms of artistry. We can't give away all of our ideas just yet..but trust us when we say our vision is clear and our plans are set. 
To help you understand what your contribution would mean, let us say this. You're not just contributing to one production. Your contribution will be the force that pushes the first snowball down the hill. If we can get this project moving, it will be the launching point for everything else. This project will help us plant our feet firmly into the ground and help us green light all of our plans. We wouldn't be able to express how grateful your contribution to this project would mean..so, we're also offering perks!

Goals and Rewards!
We can't do it alone!

To green light the project, we're looking for another $8,000. In our previous ""Gofundme"" we raised $2220! Which, is absolutely amazing. We've switched platforms, so we can reward our donors!
We will have many stages of perks to show our thanks!
If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will be used to workshop and further other projects. We're looking to get as many works as possible shown to the public and other producers and investors.

<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>Woven Theatre was started in 2016 by a trio of young directors yearning to create. Together they put on their first season, producing four projects in the span of three months. Unlike many theatre companies, Woven Theatre strayed away from the standard model involving a board of directors and instead created an Artistic Council. Being founded by three directors, the thought of an Artistic Director didn't seem to make sense. Woven Theatre wanted to be a collection of artists that came together to create and grow. </p>
<p> Young artists are hungry. They strive to be everywhere and do everything at once because opportunities are precious, and they fear passing them up. Woven Theatre gives them a chance to create art on nothing but that tenacity. Woven Theatre seeks to provide unique, artistic opportunities for young people to explore and find their artistic identity and tell the stories they are passionate about. </p>
<p>We love what we do and feel as though we provide unique and authentic perspective for the Nashville Community. No other theatre company in Nashville focuses on the production of New Plays as much as Woven. No other theatre company in Nashville focuses so heavily on the voices and stories of the LGBT+ community. </p>
<p>A contribution to our campaign goes further than just putting another show on the stage. It ensures we can pay our actors and designers and playwirghts. It ensures that new plays and artistic experiences have a chance to make it in front of audiences. New Plays are one of the most important facets in the theatre. They allow the art form to march on and grow and evolve. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We tend to keep our shows small and tight and quick. We are seeking $3,000. That's about what it costs to produce one play for us. The major of everything raised will go straight to paying our people. It will pay:</p>
<p>Actors</p>
<p>Designers</p>
<p>Stage Managers </p>
<p>Playwrights </p>
<p>Dramaturgs </p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Basically it helps to employ people. When we started Woven Theatre making sure artists got paid for their work was of the upmost importance. We are proud to say we have continued to do that for 4 years now. </p>
<p>With $3,000 we can put $1,500 toward each show to cover 1/2 of the cost. This puts us in a safe zone in case ticket sales for a night are down or if we have to cancel a perfromance. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal any funds we receive will first go to paying our people, plain and simple. </p>

<p>David has cancer. It's aggressive. And terrifying.</p>
<p>He looks at his life and all he sees are holes; the moments he won't be able to have, if this cancer is successful in its malign task. He sees one way out: Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>Dave has a circle of friends that still play, and as he thinks back on the moments they've experienced in game, he doesn't remember sitting around a table, rolling dice. He remembers every spell cast, every enemy vanquished, and every cataloged item.</p>
<p>So, the new quest: to play through potential “memories” Dave might miss. His three friends, Tyrone, Benny, and Sky, sit down with Dave's girlfriend, Meg (a gaming newbie) and chart out a path to victory.

<h3>Why it Matters</h3>
<p>As company we have been producing plays for 4 years. As individuals we have been making theatre for a decade or more a piece. It's who we are. It's what we do. And honestly we've gotten pretty good at it. You can check out our website woventheatre.org or our facebook page and see some of what we've done.  </p>
<p>With all that being said it doesn't mean we don't need help to get there! Every person who works with us in any compacity gets us closer to our final product. Maybe it's someone letting us borrow a truck to pick something up or volunteering to help sell tickets or coming to a show. Everything gets us closer. Basically, everyone is important in the creation of art. </p>
<p>As stated above almost every dime will go to paying our people. From the beginning making sure we can compensate our people has been of the upmost importance. If we had the chance to perform in the best theatre in town but we couldn't pay our actors and designers and team members, we wouldn't do it. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564598442/ba7k4zumb4qkrobxqsia.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>__________________________________________________________</h3>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Putting together live performances is hard and new plays present their own unique challenges. As a company we produce at least one World Premiere every year. Last year, including our New Works Festival, we presented 8 brand new plays. This season proves to be almost the same, with 6 Plays slotted for our New Works festival and 2 brand new, fully staged plays.</p>
<p>New works are risky from the start. Since they have never been produced there is no name recognition to pull people into the door. It's also a scary and vulnerable time for the playwright and actors. This is often the first time the playwrights have ever seen their play staged and for actors they are in many ways originating the roles. Much of what happens in the first production solidifies many aspects and stays with the play going forward. </p>
<p>These new works we do could go on to be the next off Broadway hit, or Broadway hit. They could become staples of colleges and regional theaters. This play could help launch a writers career and they could become the next Arthur Miller. Anything is possible. </p>
<p>We are a company that embraces hazard and danger when it comes to creating theatre. We are not new to the adversity it takes to run a small theatre company and produce new plays and take on the subject matter we do. As a company we have made a stand and pledge to embrace the voices and stories of the LGBTQ+ community and hire people from the community. Many of us that currently run and have run the company are a part of the LGBTQ+ community and representing it's people and culture has become near and dear to our hearts. </p>
<p>As a community we must champion and advocate for new plays and new artistic experiences. Theatre is a living, breathing, and ever evolving art form. We must continue to create new pieces or the art form will stagnate and slowly die.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
We tend to keep our shows small and tight and quick. We are seeking $3,000. That's about what it costs to produce one play for us. The major of everything raised will go straight to paying our people. It will pay:
Actors
Designers
Stage Managers 
Playwrights 
Dramaturgs 
etc.
Basically it helps to employ people. When we started Woven Theatre making sure artists got paid for their work was of the upmost importance. We are proud to say we have continued to do that for 4 years now. 
With $3,000 we can put $1,500 toward each show to cover 1/2 of the cost. This puts us in a safe zone in case ticket sales for a night are down or if we have to cancel a perfromance. 
If we don't reach our goal any funds we receive will first go to paying our people, plain and simple.

As company we have been producing plays for 4 years. As individuals we have been making theatre for a decade or more a piece. It's who we are. It's what we do. And honestly we've gotten pretty good at it. You can check out our website woventheatre.org or our facebook page and see some of what we've done.  
With all that being said it doesn't mean we don't need help to get there! Every person who works with us in any compacity gets us closer to our final product. Maybe it's someone letting us borrow a truck to pick something up or volunteering to help sell tickets or coming to a show. Everything gets us closer. Basically, everyone is important in the creation of art. 
As stated above almost every dime will go to paying our people. From the beginning making sure we can compensate our people has been of the upmost importance. If we had the chance to perform in the best theatre in town but we couldn't pay our actors and designers and team members, we wouldn't do it.

Risks & Challenges
Putting together live performances is hard and new plays present their own unique challenges. As a company we produce at least one World Premiere every year. Last year, including our New Works Festival, we presented 8 brand new plays. This season proves to be almost the same, with 6 Plays slotted for our New Works festival and 2 brand new, fully staged plays.
New works are risky from the start. Since they have never been produced there is no name recognition to pull people into the door. It's also a scary and vulnerable time for the playwright and actors. This is often the first time the playwrights have ever seen their play staged and for actors they are in many ways originating the roles. Much of what happens in the first production solidifies many aspects and stays with the play going forward. 
These new works we do could go on to be the next off Broadway hit, or Broadway hit. They could become staples of colleges and regional theaters. This play could help launch a writers career and they could become the next Arthur Miller. Anything is possible. 
We are a company that embraces hazard and danger when it comes to creating theatre. We are not new to the adversity it takes to run a small theatre company and produce new plays and take on the subject matter we do. As a company we have made a stand and pledge to embrace the voices and stories of the LGBTQ+ community and hire people from the community. Many of us that currently run and have run the company are a part of the LGBTQ+ community and representing it's people and culture has become near and dear to our hearts. 
As a community we must champion and advocate for new plays and new artistic experiences. Theatre is a living, breathing, and ever evolving art form. We must continue to create new pieces or the art form will stagnate and slowly die.

<p>Grab ahold of your Pocketballs! The Bardic Bastards return to the Hollywood Fringe after the success of their critically derided production “The Midnight Menagerie” with Pocketmon! an adult parody musical.</p>
<p>Hilariously funny and heartwarmingly nostalgic, Pocketmon is a 90 minute special journey into the dark and zany world of Soot Snag’em as he attempts to battle his way to the RobLo League.

<p>Due to strong language and mature situations, Pocketmon is recommended for audiences over the age of 16.</p>

<p><strong>The Goal:</strong><br/>To produce an outrageous and original one-act dark comedy in the Hollywood Fringe Festival.</p>
<p><strong>How To Help:</strong><br/>Empty the entirety of your bank account into the campaign fundraiser, and then move to Los Angeles to work for the production as an unpaid intern.

We hope you'll watch the video above, but we've included a transcript here as well:</i></p><p> </p><p>Hi, I’m Lauren Ash-Morgan, and I’m the artistic director of Seoul Shakespeare Company. After three comedies, it’s time for us to tackle what many consider to be Shakespeare’s greatest tragedy: <i>King Lear</i>.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Introduction to Seoul Shakespeare Company, and Updates for This Year</u></strong></p><p> </p><p>Every year since 2011, Seoul Shakespeare Company has put on a mainstage production in the spring, self-funding our shows with the help of donations and ticket sales. We serve several main communities in Seoul: audience members in the English-speaking foreign community, Korean audience members who want to experience Shakespeare in the original language with Korean surtitles, students from universities and international schools, and theatre artists in the local English-speaking community. One of our primary goals is to produce theatre of a calibre that helps local theatre artists develop their craft to a high standard, and in the last four years, we’ve been especially focusing on training and developing our casts. Talented people have been able to spend time in our company, and use that experience to further their career goals in theatre in their home countries. Alumni from our company have gone on to start their own theatre companies, go to graduate school programs in theatre, teach at university, work as actors and stage managers, and teach Shakespeare to young people. At the same time we have cultivated a core resident company of actors who have worked together consistently and developed the skills and relationships of an experienced, resident company.</p><p> </p><p>This year, for the first time, we have also been branching out internationally, connecting with top Shakespeare practitioners from around the world, in order to train and pass on training methods to our Seoul community, connect Seoul Shakespeare Company with other Shakespeare companies around the world, and develop personal connections with other Shakespeare artists. This winter, Charles Jeong, Michael Downey, and I represented Seoul Shakespeare Company at the Shakespeare Theatre Association’s annual conference, and last summer, Michael and I trained and performed in Prague Shakespeare Company’s Summer Shakespeare Intensive, studying with some of the world’s top Shakespeare practitioners. We’ve been taking the skills that we developed there, and in our own research, and applying them to our Seoul theatre community, through workshops for the public and rehearsal techniques with our <i>King Lear</i> cast. As we engage more with the global Shakespeare community, we hope to form stronger bridges between Seoul Shakespeare Company and the wider Shakespeare world.</p><p> </p><p>This is my fifth and final year as artistic director of Seoul Shakespeare Company. In these recent years, with Michael Downey as stage director and myself as artistic director, producer and designer, we’ve accomplished everything that we set out to do, and it’s time for Michael and me to use the skills that we’ve developed here and begin working on the next stage of our careers, forming our own small theatre company that can travel with us, while leaving behind a strong Seoul Shakespeare Company for the Seoul community, and hopefully, if we’re successful in our endeavors, opening up opportunities for others through our work, furthering the legacy of Seoul Shakespeare Company, and paving the way for others’ success as well as our own. In order to start preparing for that, it’s important that we allow time for a smooth transition of Seoul Shakespeare Company to its new leadership, so although Michael and I will still be around for a while, we’ll be transitioning away from Seoul Shakespeare Company after this year’s production in order to allow our new artistic director and team to take on their new roles. </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Why King Lear this year? </u></strong></p><p>I’ve been acting in this company for eight years, and for my final production as artistic director, rather than appearing onstage, I’m directing. Michael Downey, who has been directing our productions for the last four years, and who in earlier years played Macbeth, Prospero, and Titus Andronicus, will be playing King Lear, with a wonderful cast of experienced Seoul Shakespeare Company members and very talented newcomers.</p><p> </p><p><i>King Lear </i>is considered by many to be Shakespeare’s greatest play, and the most challenging play for a company to put on, and so it seems a fitting finale for Michael’s and my chapter of Seoul Shakespeare Company’s history.</p><p> </p><p>This play contains a wide variety of fascinating and challenging roles. It was written for a group of actors who were mature in their craft and had been working together in Shakespeare’s acting company for many years. It’s been said that this play requires a company of actors who have worked together on Shakespeare’s plays for a long time, and this year, we have such a company.</p><p> </p><p>In the last four years, Michael and I have really transformed this company, by developing actor training methods, nurturing talented people with a variety of levels of experience, insisting on a degree of excellence that satisfies both the actors and the audience so that both come back from year to year, and taking inspiration from the aesthetics, techniques, and pragmatism of Shakespeare’s Globe in London, including energetic pacing, continuous action without blackouts, minimal sets and props, effective use of music, attention to the text as the center of the play and mining the text for its possibilities, and creating a feeling of ensemble.</p><p> </p><p>As a result of those four years, we now have a core ensemble of actors who have been working together since our very popular first production in this style, <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, in 2016. We have all grown phenomenally through the work that we’ve done in this company, and, like Shakespeare’s original company of actors, for whom these plays were written, each actor contributes their own unique strengths to this group, perfectly complementing each other. To that core of actors, for this production, as in past years, we have added a wonderful group of new actors, some of whom had worked with us in the past and are coming back, and some of whom are new to our company. They all bring wonderfully unique qualities to this amazing ensemble cast.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>How are you approaching the play?</u></strong></p><p>Many people think of <i>King Lear</i> as a grim, very dark, very philosophical play, but in the hands of actors who are familiar with embodying Shakespeare’s work, it’s actually striking how entertaining this play is. It’s a brilliant piece of theatre, rich with feeling and intense connections between people: love and the need for love, fear, and hatred that results from feeling unloved and afraid. This play is also about the nature of suffering alone versus sharing one’s suffering with others, and the ability of others to help alleviate one’s pain.</p><p> </p><p>It’s also about how separation and non communication can breed fear and paranoia, and deepen feelings of enmity between people. In the Folio version of the play, on which our production is based, we don’t get a weak, feeble king; there is an emphasis through the revisions between the Quarto and Folio versions of the play on the fact that Lear’s daughters actually fear him, and that their fear is what motivates their viciousness towards him. </p><p> </p><p>At its heart, the play is about a king discovering his humanity. In the highly religious Jacobean era in which this play was written, the king was considered to be near-divine, and in <i>King Lear </i>we have a king who believes that he can talk to the gods, that he has a direct line of communication with them, and in the storm scene he begins to realize that he isn’t divine, that the gods aren’t listening to him, or maybe don’t exist, and that he’s just a man. And that breaks him, and makes him empathize with other people’s suffering for the first time. It’s not about a weak old king whose mind goes because of the physical shock of one night in a storm. It’s about a once-powerful king realizing that he’s just a man.</p><p> </p><p>I’ve had the general concept for this production for a number of years. I’ve trained for many years in Korean traditional music and dance (gugak), and a lot of my artistic instincts are influenced by that background. Each year I’ve included subtle references to Korean traditional music and dance in the design of our productions, through costuming, sound design, or choreography, but we’ve never approached any of our productions in a way that highlights the fact that our home is in Korea, and that everyone involved in the production lives in a hybrid cultural world. One of the reasons that I was initially drawn to <i>King Lear</i> is its sensibility that feels a lot like the Korean concept of <i>han</i> and lends itself well to the rough, earthy, cathartic  sounds of gugak. The play also has an ancient, timeless quality, and a purposeful disorientation from any particular historical period, taking place in a completely made up mythical period in Britain’s ancient history, supposedly Bronze Age, but having many features of later periods, and it has a sense of both the barbaric and the opulent. In the design of our production, I’m taking advantage of the built-in weirdness of that setting by using a combination of different styles of dress, influenced by both Korean and European historical styles, with music that features the sounds of the Korean traditional instruments geomungo and gayageum.</p><p> </p><p>All of Michael’s and my productions have included a beginning that helps to build the world of the play, either through music or through an opening scene. In this production, we’re including a beginning and ending that make use of the fact that we are in Korea, in the 21st century, and that will help us to dive into the world of <i>King Lear</i> and then re-emerge from that world, having shared an experience together. </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>Our annual crowdfunding campaign</strong></u></p><p>While ticket sales make up the majority of our budget, each year a significant portion of our budget comes from our annual crowdfunding campaign. This is a chance to show your support for what we are doing, help us continue to do this work in the future, and this year in particular, to give our next artistic director a strong foundation on which to build the next chapter of our company’s history.</p><p> </p><p>And of course, if you’re in Korea, we hope you’ll come see <i>King Lear</i>!</p><p> </p><p>Lauren Ash-Morgan</p><p>Artistic Director, Seoul Shakespeare Company</p><p> </p><p>---------------------------------</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p><p>Even if you can't give directly to our production, you can help us by sharing our campaign through social media, and, if you're in Korea, coming to our show!  </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>Korean Bank Transfer Option</strong></u></p><p>If you have a Korean bank account, you can contribute via bank transfer.  Your contribution won't show up in our Indiegogo total, but we can still send you the perks listed above.  Send us an email to let us know that you've contributed, and whether you would like to receive the associated perks, and we'll add you to our list of donors.  Here is a link to our bank information: <a href=""https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-contribution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-...</a> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Show page for<i> King Lear</i>: <a href=""https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/king-lear-2019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/king-le...</a> </p><p>Ticket Reservation Form: <a href=""https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/ticket-reservation-form"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/ticket-...</a></p><p>Facebook event page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/2231884110463342/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/2231884110463342/</a></p><p> </p><p>Seoul Shakespeare Company Home Page: <a href=""https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/</a></p><p>Seoul Shakespeare Company Facebook Page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/seoulshakespeare/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/seoulshakespeare/</a></p><p>Join our email list to receive announcements directly to your inbox:  <a href=""http://eepurl.com/bQZM9v"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://eepurl.com/bQZM9v</a></p><p> </p><p>Seoul Shakespeare Company Email: </p><p>info@seoulshakespeare.com</p><p> </p><p>Email for questions about ticketing:</p><p>sscticketing@gmail.com </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CAST</p><p>Earl of Kent: Jason Cutler</p><p>Earl of Gloucester: Martin Boswell</p><p>Edmond: Louis Groves</p><p>King Lear: Michael Downey</p><p>Gonerill: Wendy Moore</p><p>Regan: Jennifer Waescher</p><p>Cordelia: Maria Fernanda Silva</p><p>Duke of Albany: Jeffrey Wagner</p><p>Duke of Cornwall: Daniel Kennedy</p><p>Duke of Burgundy/Knight 2/Servant to Cornwall/Captain: Joshua Cate</p><p>Oswald/King of France: Stewart Gray</p><p>Edgar/Hospital Nurse: Charles Jeong</p><p>Knight: Claudia Tumba</p><p>Fool/Herald: Chris Zaczek</p><p>Curan: Amanda Conkey</p><p>Hospital Nurse/Servant to Gonerill/Soldier to Cordelia: Jiwoon Ha</p><p> </p><p>CREW</p><p>Director: Lauren Ash-Morgan</p><p>SSC Artistic Director &amp; Producer: Lauren Ash-Morgan</p><p>Stage Manager: Kathryn Dunn</p><p>Assistant Stage Managers: Makrenna Sterdan, Coral Kim, Inseo Yeo</p><p>Fight choreographer: Jason Cutler</p><p>Costume Design/Construction: Lauren Ash-Morgan</p><p>Surtitles Translator: Charles Jeong</p><p>Sound Design: Lauren Ash-Morgan</p><p>Blood FX: Amanda Conkey</p><p>Interpreter/Translator: Charles Jeong</p><p>Venue Coordinator: Charles Jeong</p><p>Surtitles English Transcription: Jamie Horan</p><p>Poster concept: Lauren Ash-Morgan</p><p>Graphic Design: Charles Jeong</p><p>Props painting, drawing, and calligraphy: Charles Jeong</p></div>","****If you would like to receive a perk, please be sure to click on ""Get This Perk."" If you accidentally donate without selecting a perk, and you would like to receive the associated perk, email us to let us know: info@seoulshakespeare.com.**** Hello to our supporters around the globe!

We’ve been taking the skills that we developed there, and in our own research, and applying them to our Seoul theatre community, through workshops for the public and rehearsal techniques with our King Lear cast. As we engage more with the global Shakespeare community, we hope to form stronger bridges between Seoul Shakespeare Company and the wider Shakespeare world. This is my fifth and final year as artistic director of Seoul Shakespeare Company. In these recent years, with Michael Downey as stage director and myself as artistic director, producer and designer, we’ve accomplished everything that we set out to do, and it’s time for Michael and me to use the skills that we’ve developed here and begin working on the next stage of our careers, forming our own small theatre company that can travel with us, while leaving behind a strong Seoul Shakespeare Company for the Seoul community, and hopefully, if we’re successful in our endeavors, opening up opportunities for others through our work, furthering the legacy of Seoul Shakespeare Company, and paving the way for others’ success as well as our own. In order to start preparing for that, it’s important that we allow time for a smooth transition of Seoul Shakespeare Company to its new leadership, so although Michael and I will still be around for a while, we’ll be transitioning away from Seoul Shakespeare Company after this year’s production in order to allow our new artistic director and team to take on their new roles.  Why King Lear this year? I’ve been acting in this company for eight years, and for my final production as artistic director, rather than appearing onstage, I’m directing. Michael Downey, who has been directing our productions for the last four years, and who in earlier years played Macbeth, Prospero, and Titus Andronicus, will be playing King Lear, with a wonderful cast of experienced Seoul Shakespeare Company members and very talented newcomers. King Lear is considered by many to be Shakespeare’s greatest play, and the most challenging play for a company to put on, and so it seems a fitting finale for Michael’s and my chapter of Seoul Shakespeare Company’s history. This play contains a wide variety of fascinating and challenging roles. It was written for a group of actors who were mature in their craft and had been working together in Shakespeare’s acting company for many years. It’s been said that this play requires a company of actors who have worked together on Shakespeare’s plays for a long time, and this year, we have such a company. In the last four years, Michael and I have really transformed this company, by developing actor training methods, nurturing talented people with a variety of levels of experience, insisting on a degree of excellence that satisfies both the actors and the audience so that both come back from year to year, and taking inspiration from the aesthetics, techniques, and pragmatism of Shakespeare’s Globe in London, including energetic pacing, continuous action without blackouts, minimal sets and props, effective use of music, attention to the text as the center of the play and mining the text for its possibilities, and creating a feeling of ensemble. As a result of those four years, we now have a core ensemble of actors who have been working together since our very popular first production in this style, Much Ado About Nothing, in 2016. We have all grown phenomenally through the work that we’ve done in this company, and, like Shakespeare’s original company of actors, for whom these plays were written, each actor contributes their own unique strengths to this group, perfectly complementing each other. To that core of actors, for this production, as in past years, we have added a wonderful group of new actors, some of whom had worked with us in the past and are coming back, and some of whom are new to our company. They all bring wonderfully unique qualities to this amazing ensemble cast. How are you approaching the play?Many people think of King Lear as a grim, very dark, very philosophical play, but in the hands of actors who are familiar with embodying Shakespeare’s work, it’s actually striking how entertaining this play is. It’s a brilliant piece of theatre, rich with feeling and intense connections between people: love and the need for love, fear, and hatred that results from feeling unloved and afraid. This play is also about the nature of suffering alone versus sharing one’s suffering with others, and the ability of others to help alleviate one’s pain. It’s also about how separation and non communication can breed fear and paranoia, and deepen feelings of enmity between people. In the Folio version of the play, on which our production is based, we don’t get a weak, feeble king; there is an emphasis through the revisions between the Quarto and Folio versions of the play on the fact that Lear’s daughters actually fear him, and that their fear is what motivates their viciousness towards him.  At its heart, the play is about a king discovering his humanity. In the highly religious Jacobean era in which this play was written, the king was considered to be near-divine, and in King Lear we have a king who believes that he can talk to the gods, that he has a direct line of communication with them, and in the storm scene he begins to realize that he isn’t divine, that the gods aren’t listening to him, or maybe don’t exist, and that he’s just a man. And that breaks him, and makes him empathize with other people’s suffering for the first time. It’s not about a weak old king whose mind goes because of the physical shock of one night in a storm. It’s about a once-powerful king realizing that he’s just a man. I’ve had the general concept for this production for a number of years. I’ve trained for many years in Korean traditional music and dance (gugak), and a lot of my artistic instincts are influenced by that background. Each year I’ve included subtle references to Korean traditional music and dance in the design of our productions, through costuming, sound design, or choreography, but we’ve never approached any of our productions in a way that highlights the fact that our home is in Korea, and that everyone involved in the production lives in a hybrid cultural world. One of the reasons that I was initially drawn to King Lear is its sensibility that feels a lot like the Korean concept of han and lends itself well to the rough, earthy, cathartic  sounds of gugak. The play also has an ancient, timeless quality, and a purposeful disorientation from any particular historical period, taking place in a completely made up mythical period in Britain’s ancient history, supposedly Bronze Age, but having many features of later periods, and it has a sense of both the barbaric and the opulent. In the design of our production, I’m taking advantage of the built-in weirdness of that setting by using a combination of different styles of dress, influenced by both Korean and European historical styles, with music that features the sounds of the Korean traditional instruments geomungo and gayageum. All of Michael’s and my productions have included a beginning that helps to build the world of the play, either through music or through an opening scene. In this production, we’re including a beginning and ending that make use of the fact that we are in Korea, in the 21st century, and that will help us to dive into the world of King Lear and then re-emerge from that world, having shared an experience together.  Our annual crowdfunding campaignWhile ticket sales make up the majority of our budget, each year a significant portion of our budget comes from our annual crowdfunding campaign.
