<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In 2011, the <strong>year-end exhibition</strong> will be an integrated event presenting both the <strong>Design and Computation Arts student works</strong>. The idea behind this approach is to strengthen the connections and collaborations between both programs. In the current semester, professor <strong>Martin Racine</strong> is giving a new course (Cart 498) focussed specifically on the principles of Exhibition Design and on the planning of the year-end show. We have the desire of trying to go beyond the typical graduation show.</p>

<p>I see Multiplex as a place to share, create and interact with the community. Even working full time, I still can't afford some of the more expensive things this space would truly benefit from. Although Multiplex has been running fine, I would love to improve the experience people have when they come here and truly give to the artists that inspire me and those around them.</p>
<p>I am asking for $7000 to transform the space. Mulitplex needs new lighting and fixtures, a projector, a camera for documentation, tools for gallery repairs, a website, and funds for artists, workshops and other events. Even if we do not raise all the money, every dollar earned will go into improving this space. I have grown up in the arts community and now I am at the point where I feel it necessary to faciliate art and music to a community that has supported me. This is my true passion and I feel so lucky to have this many people to share it with!</p>
<p>Not only will we continue to host music and art monthly, we will now be open on the weekends to feature hand-made work from Portland artists and beyond, workshops, talks and much more,</p>
<p>We have some amazing perks for donating to Multiplex! Goods and services from Emotional, Virgin Blood, Tom Whalen, Mel Paget, Alex Ian Smith, Alex Mackin Dolan, Taryn Tomasello as well as some higher donation perks that involve the space. Check them out and feel free to send me any questions you may have!</p>
<p>I know this is just the beginning of this space and I appreciate anything you can offer. There are some amazing artists and musicians in the next few weeks, please stop in anytime!</p>
<p><br/><strong>If you cannot donate,</strong><br/>but want to help, feel free to share this page with people who may be interested. There are Indiegogo share tools that will help boost who sees the page. Even if we don't reach our goal, I would still love for more people to know this space exists so they can come experience it and share with all of us!</p>

<h3>My name is Michael Jursic. I am an artist, father and schoolteacher living in Toronto, Ontario. My students and I exhibited paintings of haiku poems rendered into QR codes at various downtown Toronto locations for last year's Nuit Blanche.</h3>
<h3>This year, I'm going it alone.</h3>
<h3>The project is called, ""Voices of Fire.""  It will consist of two parts; one auditory, one visual. The first part will be supplied by a karaoke station. The second part is a Standing Wave Flame Tube, also known as a Rubens Tube. The vocal output from the karaoke station will be directed into the Rubens tube, such that the singer will be able to see his voice transformed into in the elemental form of the fire which emanates from the top of the Rubens tube.</h3>
<h3>If you're anything like me, then you'll get goosebumps over the idea of belting out ""Disco Inferno,"" on a Rubens tube/karaoke machine combo! Or givin' 'er on ""Come on Baby Light my Fire!""</h3>
<h3>I am highly committed to public art, and especially art designed for the rest of us. This installation is designed to be fun and highly interactive. More importantly, it doesn't take itself too seriously.</h3>
<h3>Your contribution to this project will help create the opportunity for potentially thousands of people to interact with this outdoor piece of art.   As well, part of my ethos as an artist is the fact of my being an Outsider, or vernacular artist. Last year, with ""The QR Poetry Project,"" we found that great art can be created by collective. I'd like to invite you to become part of the collective effort to create this great piece of art. In other words, I'd like to fire up your enthusiasm--but I'll need your help.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<h3>Well, in short, we need about $1400.00 in cash to get the fire started on this project. This will cover the following: materials to make the Rubens tube; propane; karaoke machine and PA rental; safety clothing and equipment (like fire extinguishers); pizza for volunteers. This includes about 10% extra for unexpected expenses. You will be kept abreast of the entire campaign's success and a detailed breakdown of expenses, including copies of all receipts if you wish, will be given to all contributors.</h3>
<h3>Any extra money will be donated to a children's charity. </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>As you know, I had a very successful run last year with ""The QR Poetry Project."" I am hoping to bring my artistic talent and project management skills to ""Voices of Fire,"" and take a right turn from QR, to inject a sense of fun into the whole thing.</h3>
<h3>In donating to Voices of Fire, you'll be helping to make a difference to public art. Remember, when we think of ""Art,"" we often think of highbrow art-school snobs talking about things we can't even understand, or don't think of as art. Well, helping out with this project, you'll be helping to explore the possibilities of art--small ""A"" art; outsider art--to people who would otherwise sneer at it. Plus you'll be helping lots of people--yourself included--to have lots of fun in the process of learning about public art and its possibilities.</h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<h3>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help. Here's what YOU can do to help get Voices of Fire off the ground:</h3>
<h3>Help spread the word! Twitter, facebook, or email it to your friends. You can also use share-tools and links here on Indiegogo.</h3>
<h3>Volunteer for the night of October 6th. It's going to be lots of fun, and you'll be hanging out with some really cool people who have already offered to help.</h3>
<h3>If you have any questions or suggestions as to how to make this go more smoothly, email me! I'd love to have your input and help.</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a contemporary multi-media artist living and working in Colorado's Sangre de Cristo Mountains. My studio practice is centered on the tenuous relationship between humans and the natural world and examines such issues as the human impact on ecological systems and the influences of visual representations of nature on our interaction with the land.</p>
<p>This summer, I have been offered an Aldo and Leonardo Wilderness Science and Art Collaboration residency through Colorado Art Ranch that will allow me to spend one month living in California's Sierra National Forest while I work with scientific researchers to collect data about human impacts on wilderness and make artwork about the data. The project will culminate in a public exhibition of the artwork created during the residency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I Need &amp; What You Get:</p>
<p>I am trying to raise $1500.00 that will help me realize this project. Purchasing an artwork through this campaign will allow me to fund this project by providing money to purchase art supplies, camping gear, food, and fuel for travel.</p>
<p>The items I am offering as perks are original artworks created by me! Some of the works are part of previous projects or series that explore the relationship between nature and culture; other artworks being offered will be created during or in response to my residency in Sierra National Forest.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that collaboration between artists and scientists is important in broadening our human understanding of the natural world. Scientists and artists both bring different skill sets and knowledge to the project of deciphering the world, and through the collaboration between these fields I believe that we can achieve a more vibrant and complete understanding of our place in and impact on nature. I am very excited about participating in this project and hope that through my artwork viewers might be able to attain a more intense and personal understanding of the scientific data that describes their role the natural world.  </p>

<p>The purpose of starting this IndieGoGo campaign is to raise enough money to be able to have Chest reconstructive surgery with the surgeon of my choice.</p>
<p>.....Some information on the surgery: Chest reconstructive surgery is the most common surgical procedure for female-to-male transsexuals. The most common types of FTM chest surgery are 1) the double incision bilateral mastectomy with nipple grafts, and 2) the  keyhole/periaeriolar incision. Most FTMs who have medium to large breasts opt for the double-incision mastectomy. Two large incisions are made below the nipples, that run across the chest. The surgeon will remove the breast tissue without disturbing the pectoral muscles. The nipples will be completely removed and resized to create the appearance of male nipples, which are smaller than most females. [ref. <a href=""http://www.femaletomale.org/female-to-male-surgery/chest-surgery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://www.femaletomale.org/female-to-male-surgery/chest-surgery/</u></a> ] ....</p>
<p> </p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Well, where to begin...... I'm not the best at expressing myself but to be able to educate people in turn for an opportunity to have one of my goals in life come true, would be a blessing in disguise. As well as putting myself out there for the whole world to read my story is SO comforting. Haha, just kidding.</p>
<p><br/>Anyway, hello there, my name is Alex[andra] Garita. I was born in New Jersey to a Costa Rican mother and Puerto Rican father and have two awesome older brothers as well. </p>
<p><br/>I've always known I was different since I was in Kindergarten. Yes, I know, that is young BUT when feelings and thoughts occur without any thought.... almost like basic instinct, then it should not be questioned; only embraced.. Not to say that I wanted to jump anyone's bones at that age but it was very clear to me that I was in the wrong body. For example, I remember thinking once (in kindergarten) that if I was a boy then the girls would talk to me. Lest I repeat that this was in kindergarten. </p>
<p><br/>Needless to say, this pattern of thinking followed me throughout most of my elementary, middle and high school.</p>
<p><br/>Middle and high school was probably the hardest if not the worst part of growing up as a lesbian-transgendered. The term ""trans"" was not popular or only partly accepted by our social culture mostly in part of its lacking expression in our mainstream media. </p>
<p><br/>I was the weird one in class that always sat gym out because I didn't want to change in the girls locker room. In my head I was a boy and couldn't understand why everyone else didn't see it the same way. I went as far as asking the gym teachers if I could change in their office to participate but it seemed as if that was TOO much to ask. (Mind you this was already in high school.) </p>
<p><br/>Backtracking a bit to middle school, is where I began to bind my breasts down, or what little bit of them was coming in at the time, LOL. Of course it was a half ass job and I was still called names nonetheless. ""Nipple-i-tis"" was my favorite! Ahh, I loved school. Even with the binding, I still did not feel comfortable enough to participate in gym or any physical activity in school even though it was still obligatory. </p>
<p><br/>Being hunched over just to hide my small lady lumps really affected me in many different ways that till this day I am feeling the effects from. For example, my posture paired with my gait are horribly off balance. One side of my torso is more toned then the other due to the overcompensation when wearing different binders assembled with the appropriate attire. </p>
<p>I exercise as much as can specifically for my chest but the same rules apply to breasts as they do to abs: you can do a lifetime of crunches but that belly fat isn't going to disappear by only doing crunches. My mammary gland-filled-flap-jacks aren't going anywhere unless Samantha from Bewitched comes and twitches her cute button nose for these babies to turn to pecs. </p>
<p><br/>Since the likelihood of that happening is close to none, I am here, putting my personal story on IndieGoGo with the chance that you, the reader, can relate to my story or have someone close to you that you can relate this story with. </p>

<h3> Summary</h3> <ul>
<li>My name is Kristian White, I am 15 years old. I also have beautiful red hair ;)</li> <li>I decided to start this campaign because I am very passionate about Special Effects makeup. Halloween showed me my skill in this field and I feel that going to a school at a young age will benefit my future career. </li> <li>If I attend this makeup school, not only will I have a head start that most makeup artists in the industry don't get, but I will have the ability to take advanced classes others my age don't generally get to take. It will also open the door for great networking opportunities as well as teach me important skills that are vital in this industry. </li> </ul>
<p>This is an opportunity for me to create an amazing life. A little background on me...My mom gave birth to me when she was sixteen, however she was too young to take good care of me.

 Summary 
My name is Kristian White, I am 15 years old. I also have beautiful red hair ;) I decided to start this campaign because I am very passionate about Special Effects makeup. Halloween showed me my skill in this field and I feel that going to a school at a young age will benefit my future career.  If I attend this makeup school, not only will I have a head start that most makeup artists in the industry don't get, but I will have the ability to take advanced classes others my age don't generally get to take. It will also open the door for great networking opportunities as well as teach me important skills that are vital in this industry.  
This is an opportunity for me to create an amazing life. A little background on me...My mom gave birth to me when she was sixteen, however she was too young to take good care of me. After a while, I was taken from her and a drug infested home and went to live with my great grandma, who then adopted me. My great grandmother, however, was too old for me and I found my days being wasted away in front of video games (although...I'll be honest...they were pretty fun). Eventually, my Aunt took me in to live with her. When I was in 8th Grade, my biological mom died of a heroin overdose, with my 4 year old brother in her arms. This, obviously shook me up, and it was 2 months later that I found a way to express my artistic, deep emotions. I believe makeup is a passion. I am driven by this passion and I would very much like to see where my journey will end up in this industry. I see people and wonder, ""How can I make him a zombie?"" or I see a scene in a movie and ask, ""How can I do that?"" Forgive the cheesy comparison, but much like Beethoven, this isn't a passing fad. This is real.      What I Need 
To start, I need around $2,000  to afford my first class, an intro Special effects makeup course, which is what any money I receive will fund. Anything over that goal will be saved for future classes to continue my education in this field. Like I previously stated, not many people attend a makeup school at this age, and the opportunities available to me would be much greater the earlier I attend.  If I do not reach my goal here, the funds will still go to my attendance at Ruby Makeup Academy, as I have other money making opportunities outside of Indiegogo. 
  The Impact 
This is a valuable fundraiser because it provides me with a rare chance to show the world what I'm made of. One day I could be working on zombies for the 9th season of the Walking Dead and you could be like, ""Hey, I helped that guy get to where he is today,"" and I know that would be a great feeling. I know that this is the job for me, as I have done makeup on so many people and every time I am more and more passionate about it. I know I won't get bored of it and I will always be as passionate as ever. I started this whole thing simply as me being a zombie for Halloween, and my friends saying, ""Wow, that's amazing."" Ever since then I've been inspired to do the best I can and I honestly feel this will set me apart from a majority of other makeup artists. This would be a life changer for me! 
  Risks & Challenges 
The problems I have now are mainly financial, but I feel that shouldn't stop me from doing what I enjoy. Outside of Indiegogo, I am trying to find a job so I can afford this class as well as other classes within this school. While I'm searching though, I thought I would see who would be willing to help me out. I mean to make this happen, I really need your help. 
  Other Ways You Can Help 
If you can't donate money, then please try to help me out and see who can. Spread the word about me and my quest for movie magic greatness and tell them my story! Also, don't forget Indiegogo has a share tool, so remember to use it on your Social Media pages!

<h3>What is this Project?</h3>
<p>Imagine that you are pregnant and you do not want to be. You are a diligent and caring parent of a two year-old and you just lost your job. You are struggling to make ends meet and your family is helping you pay your bills. Now imagine that you call to make an appointment for an abortion. You can get an appointment for tomorrow, but you are told that it costs $650. Your health insurance doesn't cover this, even though it covers your other medical expenses and it covered prenatal care when you were pregnant with your son. You don't know how you are going to pay your rent. How are you going to pay for an abortion? </p>
<p>This is the situation that thousands of people are faced with each year in the United States. The Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, blocks people from using Medicaid to cover abortion. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I founded the Repeal Hyde Art Project in 2011 to raise awareness and create dialogue about the Hyde Amendment. Since then, I've taken the project to 15 college campuses, community settings, and conferences. The Project is a colorful, optimistic, and interactive response to Hyde that reflects the self-determination of the people who have overcome it and the hope for change. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Participating is easy: 1. Print the template from <a href=""http://www.repealhydeartproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.repealhydeartproject.org</a> and cut out the bird; 2. Write a message on the bird about why you think that the Hyde Amendment should be repealed; and 3. Hang the birds in a public space.</span></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? It is. One conversation leads to another conversation leads to another conversation. The more we are talking, the more politicians will listen to us, and the more likely we are able to make change. We are strong and we fly together. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>So, why do you need this money?</h3>
<p>I have been running the Project for two years as a volunteer because I love what I do and I am passionate that art can spark creative change. But I need money to purchase supplies and posters to keep the Project going! The Project is slated to appear at the American Public Health Association annual conference and at Simmons College so far in 2013/2014. I need materials to be able to take it to the conferences and campuses who have extended invitations to me. </p>
<p>Here's how the funding will break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm asking for $800.</li>
<li>$250 will go towards posters, $415 will purchase markers, paper, ink, glitter, etc. so that I have materials to take to conferences/campuses/events.</li>
<li>10% of the total proceeds will benefit the <b>National Network of Abortion Funds</b>.</li>
<li>7% will go to IndieGogo/PayPal</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>What cool stuff do I get?</h3>
<p></p>

<li>Everyone who donates over $15 gets an awesome, unique Repeal Hyde Art Project postcard.</li>
<li>Everyone who donates over $25 gets an awesome postcard plus a chance to win an autographed Repeal Hyde 18x24 poster.</li>

However, ""I believe in it 100%, and I can't think of a better way to save the Indonesian land that is being destroyed by corporate greed than by arming the people that inhabit that land with the knowledge, confidence, and desire to maintain and strengthen the culture that sustained that land. The loss will be unimaginable. The land and the flora, much of which has never been discovered, will be gone. The animals -the last of their species in the wild - are being killed off. <br/><p></p>
<p>If I had money I would donate it myself. Money is worthless without great purpose. Unfortunately, I don't have money, but I do have great purpose. I have talent. I have the ability to make art objects the likes of which wealthy individuals have proven to be valuable, and if I can take that one thing I have, that one revered ability, and use it to save the rainforest and the animals within it, then I will do everything in my power to do so. <br/></p>
<p>This fundraiser is in the arts section not because I believe artists care more about animals than would animal lovers. No, it's here because I believe that art lovers care about art, and that art lovers are human, and human beings care about life and history and the planet and whatever fledgling existence of their long lost childhood is left within their contemporary bodies. <br/></p>
<p>I think back to my first painting, the one that first received notable recognition; it was a dinosaur. I painted a dinosaur, a Dilophosaurus, the one with the frilled neck. I remember thinking about how incredible it might have been to see one in person; maybe not that one, but one of the larger, more gentle dinosaurs, absolutely, and not in a cage or in the form of bones in a museum, but in the wild. Well, if we don't act now and empower somebody to protect the Indonesian rainforest in Sumatra then in less than 10 years, that's right, before many of your children will be old enough to drive or go to college or fall in love for that matter, species such as Sumatran Orangutan, Sumatran Elephant, and the White-handed Gibbon will all be dinosaurs. <br/></p>
<p>Future natural history books will know them not as living breathing creatures, but instead as mere history, and we will be remembered as the generation that valued cheap lumber and vegetable oil and alternatives to gasoline more than the existence of a beautiful species or the health and stability of a unique natural wonderland, which is what the rainforest is. Similar tropical environments only exist in maybe two other places, and they are being destroyed too... <br/></p>
<p>Please understand that I can donate art and time and effort but I have no money. I need you to take interest and donate money so that we can help Indonesia Culture Exploration save the rainforest and in doing so, save the animals with it. Thank you for your time.""   <br/></p>

I wake up. I paint what inspires me, and I follow my instincts religiously. A few years ago while working at a gallery in Detroit, I humbly made the
 acquaintance of a remarkable young women. She was roughly my age at the
 time - less than 30 - strong , mild mannered, and noticeably shy. 
Deceivingly so, because beneath the surface of her reserved exterior 
slept an iceberg of a story. <br/><p></p>Amity, this powerhouse young woman filled with heart warming passion and breathtaking purpose, the girl  that I met in a Detroit gallery that somehow managed to inspire me for three years, and is continuing to do so now in 2014, is the founder of <a href=""http://www.culturexploration.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indonesia Culture Exploration</a> (I.C.E), a <a href=""U.S.%20Charity%20ID#%20CH010014"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">non-profit 501c3</a>; ""that strives to extend and protect the borders of imperiled tropical habitats within Indonesia"", the very same areas that are threatened by palm oil and tropical timber companies.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/399436/files/20140227162111-logoslong.jpg?1393546871"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>The decimation of Indonesia's rainforest by <a href=""http://www.rainforest-rescue.org/topics/palm-oil"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">palm oil</a> and <a href=""http://www.rainforest-rescue.org/topics/tropical-timber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tropical timber</a> companies is a global threat.

It was her almost maternal, or perhaps more accurately, familial connection with Orangutan that lead her to their rescue when she founded Indonesia Culture Exploration. That's right, think less Tarzan and more Jane Goodall. <br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/399436/files/20140227162111-logoslong.jpg?1393546871"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>THE STORY (AMITY)<br/>
</h3><p>I was introduced to the world of conservation and environmentalism when I was eight years old. I was assigned a class project having to do with  family history, but instead of focusing on my own family, I decided to go to the zoo. I was entranced by the orang-utan as I observed and recorded them for 60 hours total. I found them to be majestic creatures. <br/></p><p>Upon completing my 60 hours of observation I turned to my father and declared, “This is what I want to do for the rest of my life!” <br/></p><p>He sensed my excitement and asked, “A primatologist?” <br/></p><p>To which I responded, “If that is what you call it, then yes, a primatologist.” <br/></p><p>I stayed true to those goals throughout my life, eventually becoming a primatologist, working both in captivity and in the wild. I still remember the first time I saw a wild orang-utan; I became as entranced as I was that day at the zoo. And it was then that I vowed to never return to captivity, and to do everything in my power to help the orang-utan population that remained in the wild.<br/></p><p>Later I learned of a missing species of fish. A fish that was once native to the Indonesian rainforest had all but vanished. The implications were obvious. The locals and I immediately sensed the negative impact this would have on the local ecosystem, for humans, orang-utan, and all animals alike.<br/></p><p>The village elders asked me to talk to the younger generation, to convince them not to give up their cultures and traditions for foreign ways, the same ways that resulted in the missing fish (and eventually the plummeting population of orang-utan and other species). I met with four locals from various villages and pitched my vision of Indonesia Culture Exploration; a non-profit that uses local people and their culture as a platform to protect the rainforests from destruction. They unanimously supported the idea.  It was then that Indonesia Culture Exploration was born, a way to 
protect the culture, the rainforest, and the animals.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/399436/files/20140227162111-logoslong.jpg?1393546871"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>THE ANIMALS (ENDANGERED SPECIES)</h3><p>Below is a list of the North Sumatran animals in the Gunung Leuser Ecosystem that can and will be protected by your donation to this fundraiser and the efforts of Indonesia Culture Exploration:<br/><br/><a href=""https://worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-tiger"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sumatran Tiger</a>                  <a href=""http://worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-orangutan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sumatran Orangutan</a>               <a href=""http://worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-rhino"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sumatran Rhinoceros</a></p><p><a href=""http://worldwildlife.org/species/sumatran-elephant"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sumatran Elephant</a>            <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lar_gibbon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White-Handed Gibbon</a>              <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/12.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Malay Sun Bear</a></p><p> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Argus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Argus Pheasant</a>                  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18-xvIjH8T4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slow Loris Langurs</a>                 Tomas-leaf monkey</p><p>Silver-leaf monkey              Siamang                                  Muntjack</p><p>Mouse

However, ""I believe in it 100%, and I can't think of a better way to save the Indonesian land that is being destroyed by corporate greed than by arming the people that inhabit that land with the knowledge, confidence, and desire to maintain and strengthen the culture that sustained that land. The loss will be unimaginable. The land and the flora, much of which has never been discovered, will be gone. The animals -the last of their species in the wild - are being killed off. 
If I had money I would donate it myself. Money is worthless without great purpose. Unfortunately, I don't have money, but I do have great purpose. I have talent. I have the ability to make art objects the likes of which wealthy individuals have proven to be valuable, and if I can take that one thing I have, that one revered ability, and use it to save the rainforest and the animals within it, then I will do everything in my power to do so. 
This fundraiser is in the arts section not because I believe artists care more about animals than would animal lovers. No, it's here because I believe that art lovers care about art, and that art lovers are human, and human beings care about life and history and the planet and whatever fledgling existence of their long lost childhood is left within their contemporary bodies. 
I think back to my first painting, the one that first received notable recognition; it was a dinosaur. I painted a dinosaur, a Dilophosaurus, the one with the frilled neck. I remember thinking about how incredible it might have been to see one in person; maybe not that one, but one of the larger, more gentle dinosaurs, absolutely, and not in a cage or in the form of bones in a museum, but in the wild. Well, if we don't act now and empower somebody to protect the Indonesian rainforest in Sumatra then in less than 10 years, that's right, before many of your children will be old enough to drive or go to college or fall in love for that matter, species such as Sumatran Orangutan, Sumatran Elephant, and the White-handed Gibbon will all be dinosaurs. 
Future natural history books will know them not as living breathing creatures, but instead as mere history, and we will be remembered as the generation that valued cheap lumber and vegetable oil and alternatives to gasoline more than the existence of a beautiful species or the health and stability of a unique natural wonderland, which is what the rainforest is. Similar tropical environments only exist in maybe two other places, and they are being destroyed too... 
Please understand that I can donate art and time and effort but I have no money. I need you to take interest and donate money so that we can help Indonesia Culture Exploration save the rainforest and in doing so, save the animals with it. Thank you for your time.""   
-message from Craig Paul Nowak
THE ARTISTMy name is Craig Paul Nowak, and I'm just a normal guy, an 'average joe' artist based out of Detroit, Michigan. I wake up. I paint what inspires me, and I follow my instincts religiously. A few years ago while working at a gallery in Detroit, I humbly made the
 acquaintance of a remarkable young women. She was roughly my age at the
 time - less than 30 - strong , mild mannered, and noticeably shy. 
Deceivingly so, because beneath the surface of her reserved exterior 
slept an iceberg of a story. Amity, this powerhouse young woman filled with heart warming passion and breathtaking purpose, the girl  that I met in a Detroit gallery that somehow managed to inspire me for three years, and is continuing to do so now in 2014, is the founder of Indonesia Culture Exploration (I.C.E), a non-profit 501c3; ""that strives to extend and protect the borders of imperiled tropical habitats within Indonesia"", the very same areas that are threatened by palm oil and tropical timber companies.THE PROBLEMThe decimation of Indonesia's rainforest by palm oil and tropical timber companies is a global threat. Not only do the actions of these companies threaten our planet, but perhaps more importantly, due to an impending threat of extinction, is the threat on the lives of endangered species within the Indonesian rainforest,
 all of whom depend on the rainforest for survival. And while our planet
 is arguably strong enough to live through this destruction, authorities
 have already predicted the likelihood that countless native species will become extinct (est. 1,206 threatened species in Indonesia alone) if the palm oil and tropical timber companies persist.THE INSPIRATIONNational Geographic predicts that wild orangutans may become extinct as early as 2023. That's less than 10 years from now. We have destroyed well over 80% of their natural habitat. To continue this destruction will surely change the world as we know it.Not only do orangutan serve as the inspiration for this fundraiser via paintings, drawings, and prints as perks, they are also what spurred Amity's decision to lead a peaceful fight against ongoing rainforest commodification and subsequent destruction. It was her almost maternal, or perhaps more accurately, familial connection with Orangutan that lead her to their rescue when she founded Indonesia Culture Exploration. That's right, think less Tarzan and more Jane Goodall. THE STORY (AMITY)
I was introduced to the world of conservation and environmentalism when I was eight years old. I was assigned a class project having to do with  family history, but instead of focusing on my own family, I decided to go to the zoo. I was entranced by the orang-utan as I observed and recorded them for 60 hours total. I found them to be majestic creatures. Upon completing my 60 hours of observation I turned to my father and declared, “This is what I want to do for the rest of my life!” He sensed my excitement and asked, “A primatologist?” To which I responded, “If that is what you call it, then yes, a primatologist.” I stayed true to those goals throughout my life, eventually becoming a primatologist, working both in captivity and in the wild. I still remember the first time I saw a wild orang-utan; I became as entranced as I was that day at the zoo. And it was then that I vowed to never return to captivity, and to do everything in my power to help the orang-utan population that remained in the wild.Later I learned of a missing species of fish. A fish that was once native to the Indonesian rainforest had all but vanished. The implications were obvious. The locals and I immediately sensed the negative impact this would have on the local ecosystem, for humans, orang-utan, and all animals alike.The village elders asked me to talk to the younger generation, to convince them not to give up their cultures and traditions for foreign ways, the same ways that resulted in the missing fish (and eventually the plummeting population of orang-utan and other species). I met with four locals from various villages and pitched my vision of Indonesia Culture Exploration; a non-profit that uses local people and their culture as a platform to protect the rainforests from destruction. They unanimously supported the idea.  It was then that Indonesia Culture Exploration was born, a way to 
protect the culture, the rainforest, and the animals.THE ANIMALS (ENDANGERED SPECIES)Below is a list of the North Sumatran animals in the Gunung Leuser Ecosystem that can and will be protected by your donation to this fundraiser and the efforts of Indonesia Culture Exploration:Sumatran Tiger                  Sumatran Orangutan               Sumatran RhinocerosSumatran Elephant            White-Handed Gibbon              Malay Sun Bear Argus Pheasant                  Slow Loris Langurs                 Tomas-leaf monkeySilver-leaf monkey              Siamang                                  MuntjackMouse

<p>Let me begin by telling you a little bit about myself since I suppose you could call me one of the main men behind the curtain so to speak that is bringing <b>The Art Of Big 'O' </b>book project to you here on indiegogo.com My name is <b>Michael Fishel</b>, and I am an artist, and a <b>Big 'O'</b> artist too. Without going into a full biography mode here I will just say that I have pretty much made my living over my lifetime with my art. I have been painting creatively since 1968. I had my paintings published by <b>Big 'O' </b>as posters and art card sets in 1975. I worked for <b>TSR</b> <b>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </b>as a book illustrator for books with cover art by master fantasy artists like <b>Keith Parkinson</b> and <b>Jeff Easley</b> in the 1980s and have painted book cover art for authors <b>H.P.

<p>As I said previously while I could be considered the main man behind the curtain that is bringing this exciting art book project to you, I certainly haven't been back there alone however!

<p><b>You funded The Art Of Big 'O' Book on Kickstarter. Why are you using Indiegogo for The Art Of Big 'O'?</b></p>
<p>There are a few reasons. First, the experience I had on Kickstarter taught me a valuable lesson: I needed more experience in the fine art of crowd funding! I wanted to use Indiegogo for the benefit of a new experience. Second, I'm moving more quickly than Kickstarter wants. It turns out that they wouldn't allow me to do a second campaign in such rapid succession. Third, Almost all of the wonderful people who pledged on Kickstarter who are partners with me in realizing the dream of getting this amazing book printed informed me that they will help out no matter where the campaign is! So, hello Indiegogo!</p>

With your help I will use what is raised in this campaign to finish the final touches on the layout and design of the book, and then I will go ahead with the printing of the book to deliver to you the highest quality product that is possible.
I have brought together this collection of amazing artists and would like your support in my effort to preserve these iconic pieces of 1960’s and 70's album cover and fantasy and fantastic art history and to be a part of the journey with me to help finish this lavish full color coffee table book which will not only be treasured now but for future generations to come.

Frequently Asked Questions:
I've changed my mind. Can I get a refund?
Sorry, Indiegogo’s policy is No Refunds. Unfortunately, there’s nothing we can do about this. When your contribution is deposited into our PayPal account, it comes from Indiegogo, not from you. So if we were to refund your contribution, it wouldn't make it back to you. Please see Indiegogo’s rules here.
Can I get multiple perks?
Yes! You can back our campaign as many times as you want, choosing as many perks as you want.
Can I change my perk?
Unfortunately, not during the campaign. But a few weeks after the campaign closes, we will send you an email with a link to a system that will help you manage your perk, input your shipping information, and purchase add-ons if you choose.

You funded The Art Of Big 'O' Book on Kickstarter. Why are you using Indiegogo for The Art Of Big 'O'?
There are a few reasons. First, the experience I had on Kickstarter taught me a valuable lesson: I needed more experience in the fine art of crowd funding! I wanted to use Indiegogo for the benefit of a new experience. Second, I'm moving more quickly than Kickstarter wants. It turns out that they wouldn't allow me to do a second campaign in such rapid succession. Third, Almost all of the wonderful people who pledged on Kickstarter who are partners with me in realizing the dream of getting this amazing book printed informed me that they will help out no matter where the campaign is! So, hello Indiegogo!",28.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><i>My name is Alycia D’Avino  </i>I am currently an Artist and Owner of Yummi Studios. In 2007 I graduated with a BA in Art Education but was unable to secure a teaching position due to the uprise in the industry. In 2010 I decided to start my own Arts &amp; Crafts company. While managing the business Part Time I maintained a FT position as a Arts &amp; Recreation Director within the healthcare industry. <br/><br/>In September of 2015 I decided to run the business full time and began taking my Arts &amp; Crafts classes mobile, delivering artistic fundraisers on a large scale, instructing 40-100 guests per class. We were able to donate $26,645 to 30 different charities within the first year alone. Eventually, hauling around such a large amount of metal easels took its toll on my back, which inspired me to create The Pop-Up Canvas. </p>
<p>Since inception, we have received a tremendous positive response and have had countless requests to bring the product to schools, homes and classrooms of all kinds, not just art classrooms. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this funding and ability to fulfill purchase orders, we will be able to distribute The Pop-Up Canvas and Kit to schools, recreation centers and homes worldwide. We hope these products will help bring back The Creative Arts to budget cut schools and make Art making experiences more accessible and appealing to all. These products are designed to be used by anyone, not just artists.</p>
<p>We are producing 2 products. The Pop-Up Canvas, and The Pop-Up Kit which comes with all painting materials necessary and video painting instruction, which is accessible from any smart device, and allows for a session of creative expression anytime, anywhere. </p>
<p>This product will also enable others to host their own Painting Fundraising Events. Many schools and recreation centers have talented art instructors but have been unable to host their own painting events because they are unable to invest in the quantity of easels and brushes needed.</p>

<p></p></div>","Why Does Fun-A-Day Matter?Fun-A-Day is one of the largest, all-ages, non-curated art shows in the entire state of Delaware and - with your help - we can continue to put on this amazing community event. We are not a formal organization but a volunteer-run collective of artists and art enthusiasts - Kati Driscoll, Sarah Houghton, Sheila Master, Valerie Thiel and Alan Brown form the Delaware Fun-A-Day team.Delaware Fun-A-Day has doubled its size year over year which is awesome news! 2014 has seen a further increase in participants - which also means an increase in costs. In 2012 and 2013 100% of Fun-A-Day up-front costs were provided by the people organizing the event, with donations helping to alleviate a fraction of the expense.If you loved being a part of such an epic art project and show last year, if you enjoyed attending the event, or if you're in support of accessible and affordable community art shows then please make a donation.  We would easily reach our goal if...Every artist who is participating donated $15 - $25OR all our Facebook fans donated just $10 OR every attendee from last year's show donated only $5!We are doing something amazing & totally different. Be a part of it!Where Does My Donation Go?To accomplish our goal of keeping Fun-A-Day free and accessible to persons of all income levels, we are asking for your financial support. Your donation helps us pay for:
Space rental 
Web maintenance 
Hanging supplies 
Paint and repair materials
A/V supplies 
Event supplies
Food & beverage
Administration 
Although we reuse items year after year and use recycled items for display or decoration purposes, we still have new or unexpected costs involved with an event of this scale.  Any additional funds received or not used in 2014 will be rolled over to support future Fun-A-Day events.What Rewards Are Being Offered?We are glad you asked! Prizes range from a virtual head nod to an extravagant evening on the town, curated art collection and champagne toast at the 2014 show. Scroll down for more details or if you really, really love GIFs!

<p>     Snow blanketing the landscape outside my middle school classroom windows each northern winter fueled my desire for sunny skies and warm vistas without a snow shovel in sight!  Finally stepping off that plane at Southwest Florida Regional Airport felt like coming home.  Walking through the vast expanse of lobby I was immediately captivated by the way in which art is used to announce the cultural diversity and visual impact of this tropical paradise. </p>

<p align=""LEFT"">     Currently I am preparing a proposal to exhibit at the Southwest Florida Regional Airport as part of their ""Ärt in Flight"" program.  I will need about 20 pieces of original work to accommodate the exhibit space.  To that end I have completed the first seven:  ""Magnolia in Leaves"", ""Passionflower Party"", Ünder the Coconut Palm"", ""Plumeria in Sunlight"", ""Night-blooming Cereus"", ""Pink Bromeliad with Pup"" and ""Birds-of-Paradise "". </p>
<p align=""LEFT"">    I am focusing on the flora surrounding me in this southwest paradise.  Additional pieces will showcase the Gloriosa Lily, the Hibiscus varieties, Water Lily, the Canna, the Mahoe as well as foliage plants that include Croton, Purple Queen, and Copperleaf and other succulents similar to ""Pink Bromeliad"".  The seven completed pieces for this Florida series can be viewed on the Gallery page as well as in the video on this site and at my website link below, where you will find other images of my work also.</p>

<h3>Why a Badass Women Calendar?</h3>
<p>I was blown away with the support that the 2017 Badass Women Calendar received, and I'm so excited that y'all want more!</p>
<p>A little about last year's calendar:</p>

<p>I'm using this project to specifically lift up Badass Women of color, queer Badass Women, and people who may not usually get as much attention for being badass, even though they have made awesome contributions to the fight for equality.</p>
<p>This feels like an important and fun project to me because I get to celebrate Badass Women and hopefully inspire people throughout the year (plus I get to draw and learn about some incredible humans).</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you pre-order a calendar, you will definitely receive one (unless some unforeseen circumstances prohibit the whole project from finishing, in which case, you'll receive a refund).</p>
<p>There is a small general risk your delivery could be delayed by USPS. (If you do not receive your calendar by Thanksgiving, please contact me)</p>

<h3>Other Ways to Be Involved</h3>

<li>Even if you can't pre-order a calendar right now, you can totally share this with your mom and hint that it would make a GREAT gift, or tip off your local badass boutique to order some wholesale.</li>

 Continuing!

I have made it so far to just start my first stop-Boston. And I am one step closer now because I reach out to you. Your support will be so much appreciated by the people along this project who need this experience, which includes you. The fund will be going to:

Borrowing Gears: projectors, projector screens, sound systems.
Getting Accessories: projector cables, speaker cables, power strips, and extension chords.
Constructing Materials: woods, cars, staple gun, staples, screws,nails, drills, fabrics for constructing the gallery into a black box.
Rent fee for the Gallery throughout different cities and countries.
Travel expense throughout the whole journey.



  The Impact! 
This project drives to pass on the encouragement to those who need to take the pressure in order to finish missions or carry on their losses. I want as many as you can experience the installation, and zooms in yourselves, continuing believing
 in who you are, continuing the unknown pressure that were there or will be there in your life.


   Challenges! 
Through the process of putting everything together includes borrow gears, asking for help to construct, searching for gallery who is interested in starting my first installation, I met tremendous challenges and countless rejects from people or institutions due to many reasons including that I am a young artist and just start my first art installation. However, I still receive a lot of helps from many individuals, and I will not give up this project and cannot wait to have it exhibit elsewhere besides Boston. I hope that those who have the interest in hosting the exhibition in their cities will contact me and continue this project with me together.

As the longest-running and most influential integrated media arts festival in Canada Images is dedicated to moving-image art in all its forms. The Images Festival is a venue for moving image art that provides artists with a supportive and professional forum in which to present their work and to connect with each other, with curators and programmers, as well as with audiences that expect and appreciate the unusual, the surprising, and the inventive.




Images was created in
response to issues of accessibility, breaking down barriers created by industry
conventions. From the beginning, the organization championed alternatives to
commercial media, and fought to open up critical dialogue about power,
representation and censorship. 
2016 Images Festival April 14-23 full catalogue:

When was the last time you looked up at the moon?
Divine and serene, the moon is a resting place for our heart. 
After a long day, we sometimes want to take a glimpse at the moon for a sense of relief, only to find skyscrapers in the city...
But now, you can bring the moon along with you.
Inspired by the moon, the artwork ─ Luna, hopes to bring more delight and content into your life. Indulge yourself into the moonlight. Let Luna illuminate your space, and your mind.





It's the design decor that turns your space into a magical world. It's the lamp that lightens up your favorite reading corner. You decide what Luna is, and how you want to make your life prettier with it.



When Luna joins a space...






When Luna meets people...













Luna is mainly made of glass fiber and non-toxic latex. Its luminosity ranges from LUX1 to LUX5.
If you want to hang Luna on the ceiling, simply install a hook on the ceiling, use a durable string (nylon string is recommended here - it's strong and transparent), pass the cord through the ring on top of Luna and hang it on the hook. 
7 Sizes of Luna



Every Luna comes with a cord, and a device to adjust luminosity. Luna M (and smaller) uses E27/28W/110V Halogen bulbs; Luna L (and bigger) uses E27/42W/110V Halogen bulbs.

Luna XXS is an exception: the unique mini lantern is equipped with an LED bulb and a battery instead of a Halogen bulb and a cord. The luminosity is not adjustable, and it's not suitable for hanging. 





Aiming to bring rich imagination to people about their spaces ─ living rooms, studios, yards and so on, we want to overcome the limits of conventional decoration. The moon has been a divine and enchanting symbol in human history, and it brings you mystery, delight, relief and romance. Luna unveils the potential of a space.

I have already exceeded my goal.All money will be distributed throughout these categories.  I intend to use a special account to keep track of all the monies.Perks! oh we've got Perks!I am drawing on my artistic skills to provide you with thank-you perks. Examples of the puppets can be found in the gallery.Here is my pastels website:       www.amyzingarts.com   Why Amy?
 I am overwhelmed by the flow of support coming out of both the puppet and Improv communities in Portland.  Thank you all.

Where's it going?
 The funds raised will be 
invested in several aspects of my art.  I would like to purchase some tools for 
my workbench.  I would like to get more prints of my work made, and enter
 into more art fairs. And I would like to get a car share membership, to
 help me perform my shows around town. 
In fact, I am open to 
suggestions, but treating your gifts ethically is my main 
concern and I will keep you posted about how all the money is spent.
On the other hand, If a miracle presents itself, I will say YES to it.  I will not give up entirely or easily.  This is too important.

   BROKE?  That's Okay!
 If you can't make a $$ contribution, you can still help me out, by sharing and spreading my campaign.  Use the share tools on this page.  You can send me cheerful messages, I really appreciate them.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is The Art Cart?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Art Cart  is a rolling gallery that brings the work of
contemporary artists to various communities in Charleston, and the larger South Carolina Community. It's
primary goals are to: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1 - support contemporary artists in Charleston, SC by providing an alternative exhibition space. <br/></p>
<p>2 - expand the artist and community experience of contemporary art by offering exhibitions of invited artists from around the country.<br/></p>
<p>3 - introduce various communities to new artwork by bringing the
artwork to them. Communities will include the downtown area, public
parks/gathering places, and traditionally non-art viewing neighborhoods.</p>
<p>4 - Provide a rolling workshop where exhibiting/participating artists can bring art-making projects to the local community including seniors, families, and students. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Art Cart is an artist-led project, founded by Jonell Jaime Pulliam.  Pulliam is an artist and educator with over 13 years of experience working in museums, colleges, and community based organizations in New York City and  Charleston, SC. </p>

It means the world to me, thank you so much!</p><h3><u><strong>HISTORY</strong></u></h3><p>In 2014 my good friend and Burning Man campmate, Moki, had the idea of acquiring some rocking horses to tie up outside of our camp Shangri-Lawless as an ode to the western half of our namesake. I instantly loved the idea and although we were not able to make it happen that year, in 2015 I made it my mission to see the project through. </p><p>Originally I planned on collecting rocking horses to bring, but quickly discovered that rocking horses are not only expensive, but they are almost never adult sized or big enough to be enjoyed by a large group of people... I had to design my own.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469729199/nygt53lemxavsbbgwilf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> With the financial backing from my theme camp I was able to achieve my goal and bring my newborn 6 foot tall, 6 foot long rocking horse to the 9:30 and B corner of Black Rock City.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469656659/ats1udzajzmvsj79rxrw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>She was a beautiful horse, but she, like many of us at our first burn, was lacking steezy style, and the kind of finery that could help her reach her full potential.

Visitors to our camp were brought back to their childhood as they climbed aboard this magical stallion. It is hard to tell before experiencing for yourself, but she is super fun to ride. Maybe it is the danger of being so high off the ground, her unique design that allows for creative riding styles including standing, sitting, wheelies, and more. She is designed in a way that makes it very difficult to take it too far, even if it feel like you might be close to the edge.</p><h3><u><strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong></u></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469655323/jwacshpdrtyenjqrwlnc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The horse was made by using a CNC to precisely cut the high quality baltic birch wood pieces. The pieces were then glued and bracketed together to form the working horse. Using this process made the horse stronger and more durable as well as less likely to warp under the high temperatures of the Black Rock Desert. The horse is made up of 2 double reinforced sides with support pieces down the center that hold the sides at a slight inward angle. She is completed by a 2 inch thick acrylic block with an ornate heart laser etched into it that is visible from the front of the horse.</p><p> </p><h3><u><strong>BURNING MAN 2016 VISION: A REAL SPARKLE PONY</strong></u></h3><p>With the exception of some minor repairs and reinforcements, the structure is still in great shape thanks to a really strong original design.

What is That Which Is Most Beautiful? (referred to with affection as ""TWIMBY"")


You approach a radiant and beautiful circular
structure with vibrantly colored walls that glow from within.  At night, the colors fluoresce and resonate under
black lights.  A sign above the entrance
entices you with the words, â€œTHAT WHICH
IS MOST BEAUTIFUL.â€ You enter into the glowing labyrinth filled with wonder
and anticipation. What will I find in
here? Your â€œwalk in beautyâ€ is inspired by the DinÃ© peopleâ€™s
understanding that we create the world around us, and if we walk with beauty in
our hearts and minds, the world will be a more beautiful place.
This interactive art installation is designed
to allow participants to fully immerse in a beautiful and moving experience of
color, music, and inspirational words. 
As visitors travel through the labyrinth, they will read beautiful,
powerful words of wisdom written upon the walls â€“ pearls which have been shared
with us by some of the worldâ€™s respected indigenous leaders, healers and
wisdom keepers. Those who are
walking within the labyrinth will also hear blessings, songs, chants and drumming from many
of these wise people. All of these recordings were given to the Ringing Rocks
Foundation to be shared with the people of the world. 
â€œDuring my time at Ringing Rocks, I was blessed
to spend time with many of the worldâ€™s Wisdom Keepers.  It was an unbelievable privilege to sit with these
elders and listen to the powerful words they shared. It is my sincerest wish,
that, as people walk through this labyrinth, they feel a bit of the magic
one experiences when listening to the deep wisdom of our elders,â€ says Stephen
DeNorscia, co-creator of That Which is
Most Beautiful. â€œThis is not a religious experience - the wisdom these
elders are sharing is nothing new to us. It is wisdom we ALL hold in our
hearts. It moves us because it is TRUE. The goal of this project is to allow
all who experience it to be moved in a deep, personal, and beautiful way.â€


The Impact
We anticipate that TWIMBY will have numerous positive impacts - many impossible to anticipate and we're excited to find out!



* For visitors to the installation, it will provide a stimulating and joyful sensory environment, as well as having the potential to be a profound psychological and emotional catharsis - a vivid reminder of our spiritual connection with all beings, and a validation of our intrinsic value and uniqueness, as individual members of the human family.

* For the indigenous leaders who have shared with us some of their wisdom and prayers, we honor their wishes that we pass this on to others in our community.



*We'd love to make the labyrinth available to people outside of the Apogaea Festival on other occasions


* For the co-creators who build this project with us, there will be friendships forged, community strengthened, skills learned and practiced in a non-judgemental atmosphere of creative play, repeated cycles of productivity and celebration.. the joy of Getting Big Stuff Done With Friends And Having Fun While Doing It!

Nice to meet you :) We are two designers who have been together for almost(!) two years now. We are taking the <b>trip of our dreams</b> very soon, and we are calling upon the powers of the internet and friendship to help us!
<br/><br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/0xhOU1h.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><p>We met in the glorious spring of 2012. Well, we met on the internet way before that, but our first real hug was in the spring of 2012. It was like this—Christian was traveling around North America, and was in Toronto at the time. Ali offered him a place to stay in Calgary, just to hang out as friends and see a new exciting place, so he found a touring band who was driving from Toronto to Calgary and hitched a ride with them. </p>
<p>We fell in super love. We liked being around each other a lot and decided to do whatever it took to be around each other all the time. So we spent the rest of the spring, summer and fall in Calgary, and then left Canada to spend the winter holidays with Christian’s family and friends in Georgia. Since then, we've been working in our own respective countries and visiting each other across the border as often as we can.</p>
<p>Our time together has been <b>amazing</b>, but not without some tough life stuff along the way. There was the time Christian was denied entry to Canada due to a lack of proper visa and return plane ticket. We cried as we parted ways, not knowing when we would ever see each other again. Then there was the time Calgary flooded lots and lots, and our beautiful love nest of an apartment was destroyed. But we’ve stayed very happy, very excited to live life together and experience the world. We’ve been trying to stay in the same country together for as long as possible, but money and immigration laws make it difficult.  A few months ago, Christian decided to try and apply for school in Calgary. AND GUESS WHAT?! Just last week, he found out he was accepted to the University of Calgary!!  :)</p>

It’s one of the reasons  we got along so well when we first met. It’s been Ali’s dream to visit since she was 11, when she first started learning Japanese. Christian has been to Tokyo once, many years ago, and has desperately wanted to return ever since. A couple of months ago, we finally gathered together the money to afford the trip, bought plane tickets and booked our accommodations.</p>
<p>Our departure is date approaching quickly! But, as everything always seems to happen at once, a lot of unexpected expenses have come up. The flood last year made it exceptionally difficult to find an affordable place to live in Calgary, but Ali recently found a fantastic place to rent—though, sealing the deal meant handing over a hefty damage deposit and first month’s rent. And Christian being accepted into the University of Calgary means having to fork over some big fat tuition bucks soon. We are very fortunate, and these are expenses that we are happily paying, but their timing is kinda stinky. So, the way it’s looking now, we probably won’t get to experience very much of Japan during our two weeks there. I mean, we’ll be mainly staying in Tokyo—I don’t think it’s possible to have a BAD time in Tokyo (unless you’re arrested?), but there are SO many things we would love to see and do while we are there. Nothing crazy or lavish, no expensive meals, just modest trips and places we’ve always wanted to visit (<a href=""http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ghibli Museum!</a>), and fellow artists we would like to meet and support while we are there.</p>

Be a part of sending the first ever Tourettes Without Regrets Slam
Team to the 2011 National Poetry Slam in Boston.  
The long:
 Tourettes Without Regrets- The Fight Club of
Underground Art  “is a bare-ass free-for-all under the guise of a poetry slam”* ""Tourettes is sex, drugs, and spoken word,""
says show host and National Poetry Slam Champion Jamie DeWolf. ""It's like
a party for poets, sort of a debaucherous celebration of id. Ultimately, it's a
poetry show at heart -- it's just a much more renegade form of poetry."" 
Tourettes is
taking the irrepressible ferocity and talent it’s been bringing to the bay for
11 years to the stage in Boston for the 2011 National Poetry Slam Championships
FOR THE FIRST TIME.  
Your donation
will help us get 4 teammates and a manager from California to Boston and put em
up in a hotel for the week of competition. 
The less we have to fret about how we get there, the more we can focus
on killing stages once we arrive, so every little bit helps.
This is slam
history, be a part of making it. 
 About
the National Poetry Slam:
 The National Poetry Slam is America's
biggest team poetry slam. Held every year since 1990, it is the definitive showcase
for competitive performance poetry. Billed as ""the competitive art of
performance poetry,"" Slam was invented in Chicago in July 1986 by
construction worker-turned-poet Marc Smith. It is a fast-paced competition
where poets have a limited amount of time to impress judges randomly selected
from the audience. Storytelling, lyricism, and stand-up  comedy all come together in what’s evolved to
a modern oral tradition. This year, the 22nd annual National Poetry Slam will
be held in Boston, Massachusetts, and expects to draw a record number of teams.

My journey started twenty-seven years ago, when I was suspended from the Virginia Military Institute and returned to my home town in North Carolina. I was academically ruined, demoralized, and casting about aimlessly, unsure of what to do next.</p>
<p>Then, on a morning that I still remember in detail, I was at work in an industrial supply warehouse when the idea to teach myself how to paint suddenly popped into my head. It was such a clear calling, and for the first time in my life, I felt a sense of direction. Everything snowballed from there. I returned to school and graduated with honors, with a BFA in sculpture. I sold out my student show and have had many more moments of success, as well as enthusiastic collectors and supporters of my earlier work.</p>
<p>But from that fateful morning, I felt that I had been put on a specific path of self-discovery. I've always had faith that I was working towards a moment when mature work, timing and opportunity would all converge and that only then<em> </em>would I be ready to run with what I had.</p>
<p>That moment finally came just before Christmas 2011. A huge job had just cancelled on me at the last minute. I was despondent, but I had a ton of time on my hands. On a whim, I combined two of my most recent materials to create my first plastic jewelry, and I saw the life I had been waiting for right in front of me. It was an amazing moment of recognition. I was already slated to show my zip tie sculptures at a gallery during the citywide Fiber Philadelphia biennial in March 2012, and my jewelry turned out to be the hit of the show. I worked on commissions all month, sought out advice from friends in the field, and began setting things in motion to make this my full-time career. I'm seeking to raise money to offset the costs of:</p>
<p>-Designing and building a new website and printing new business cards</p>
<p>-Time and materials to create a cherry-picked body of work and build inventory</p>
<p>-Travel to select cities that I see as viable markets and where I have established support networks - Houston, TX; Nashville, TN; Chicago; and New York to start. In each of these cities I will continue to work, develop networks and seek venues.</p>
<p>As a contractor (my day job), I was financially ruined by the Great Recession. I'm now a full-time gypsy. Eventually, I would like to be able to settle down again and have an established studio, so any amount I raise will have a huge impact by giving me the financial power to bring this vision to life. All contributions, regardless of size, will be personally acknowledged! I will always be eternally grateful for the strength and faith it has taken to get me to this point.

<p>Hi, my name is Nora Delgado and I am a volunteer for Encuentro Latino Community Art Center. I found out about this organization about 18 months ago, and since then I realize the undeniable level of passion and commitment from Miguel Angel Rios – the founder, and the rest of the volunteers that keep fueling this organization with their in-kind donations.</p>
<p>Encuentro Latino was founded in 2007 by Mexican artist, Miguel Angel Rios with the mission to provide a space for upcoming Latino Artists. Over the years it has evolved into an artistic community outlet for children, teenagers and adults alike, offering art, dance, and baile folkorico classes; organizing free family events and serving as a cultural mecca in Lynwood, CA and its surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Since its doors opened, Encuentro Latino has impacted the lives of 100,000 people!!! It offers a yearly average of 200 art workshops, caters to 4,000 students, organizes 8 art &amp; cultural events reaching 2,000 community members per event, and recruits over 1,000 volunteers throughout the year; this impact cannot be overlooked!</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>I have worked with many wonderful non-profit organizations that I support to this day, however,  I can genuinely say that Encuentro Latino is what I call a grassroots movement. Every month Miguel, his wife Karin Guerra, his brother Fernando Rios, and the volunteer team devote hundreds of labor hours and donate from their personal funds knowing that they are positively impacting at-risk youth and providing a cultural space for the community. </p>
<p>Your donations will not only ensure that the Art Gallery remains open throughout 2013 but it will help us secure the operating costs of upgrading from a single room to a Community Art Center in Lynwood. Our limited space does not allow us to adequately serve the community and offer dance classes which are highly solicited. In order to continue offering affordable classes to the community at large we need your donations to subsidize the operating costs. We are currently in the process of officially becoming a non-profit 501 c(3), this will allow us to become eligible for state and federal grants but until then we kindly ask you to donate.</p>
<p>Help us upgrade from one room to a community center and impact 20,000 people throughout 2013. The following is the breakdown of the operating expenses for one year:</p>
<p>***As you will see this does not include a salary or monetary compensation for Miguel, the volunteer instructors, and all the supporting artists that share their skills &amp; talent every single day.</p>
<ul>
<li>$16,000  (rent, utilities &amp; insurance)</li>
<li>$20,000  (art materials for all in house and community event students – reaching 4,000)</li>
<li>$8,000 to (tents, chairs, tables, &amp; sound equipment for 8 FREE community events (2,000 expected guests)</li>
</ul><p>*Our fundraiser will culminate with a Cultural Art Celebration on Sunday, April 21st, <sup> </sup>2013 at Plaza de la Raza. Featuring local artists, musicians, vendors, ethnic food, and lots more! We hope you can join the celebration, it’s completely FREE!</p>
<h2><strong>Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Encuentro Latino represents the heart of the Lynwood community. It is here, that at-risk children are offered the opportunity to freely express their emotions through art, learn about specific artistic techniques, harness their passion, and develop their innate talents. It is here, that volunteer teachers become mentors to students and parents. It is here that thousands have witnessed the healing of physical, emotional, and spiritual wounds. It is here, that the right brain breaks free from the left while reaching into the heart and manifesting a vision for a better tomorrow.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially to this cause, we are still grateful for taking the time to learn more about us. There are many ways you can become a part of this movement:</p>

Hi, my name is Nora Delgado and I am a volunteer for Encuentro Latino Community Art Center. I found out about this organization about 18 months ago, and since then I realize the undeniable level of passion and commitment from Miguel Angel Rios – the founder, and the rest of the volunteers that keep fueling this organization with their in-kind donations.
Encuentro Latino was founded in 2007 by Mexican artist, Miguel Angel Rios with the mission to provide a space for upcoming Latino Artists. Over the years it has evolved into an artistic community outlet for children, teenagers and adults alike, offering art, dance, and baile folkorico classes; organizing free family events and serving as a cultural mecca in Lynwood, CA and its surrounding communities.
Since its doors opened, Encuentro Latino has impacted the lives of 100,000 people!!! It offers a yearly average of 200 art workshops, caters to 4,000 students, organizes 8 art & cultural events reaching 2,000 community members per event, and recruits over 1,000 volunteers throughout the year; this impact cannot be overlooked!
What We Need & What You Get
I have worked with many wonderful non-profit organizations that I support to this day, however,  I can genuinely say that Encuentro Latino is what I call a grassroots movement. Every month Miguel, his wife Karin Guerra, his brother Fernando Rios, and the volunteer team devote hundreds of labor hours and donate from their personal funds knowing that they are positively impacting at-risk youth and providing a cultural space for the community. 
Your donations will not only ensure that the Art Gallery remains open throughout 2013 but it will help us secure the operating costs of upgrading from a single room to a Community Art Center in Lynwood. Our limited space does not allow us to adequately serve the community and offer dance classes which are highly solicited. In order to continue offering affordable classes to the community at large we need your donations to subsidize the operating costs. We are currently in the process of officially becoming a non-profit 501 c(3), this will allow us to become eligible for state and federal grants but until then we kindly ask you to donate.
Help us upgrade from one room to a community center and impact 20,000 people throughout 2013. The following is the breakdown of the operating expenses for one year:
***As you will see this does not include a salary or monetary compensation for Miguel, the volunteer instructors, and all the supporting artists that share their skills & talent every single day.

$16,000  (rent, utilities & insurance)
$20,000  (art materials for all in house and community event students – reaching 4,000)
$8,000 to (tents, chairs, tables, & sound equipment for 8 FREE community events (2,000 expected guests)
*Our fundraiser will culminate with a Cultural Art Celebration on Sunday, April 21st,  2013 at Plaza de la Raza. Featuring local artists, musicians, vendors, ethnic food, and lots more! We hope you can join the celebration, it’s completely FREE!
Impact
Encuentro Latino represents the heart of the Lynwood community. It is here, that at-risk children are offered the opportunity to freely express their emotions through art, learn about specific artistic techniques, harness their passion, and develop their innate talents. It is here, that volunteer teachers become mentors to students and parents. It is here that thousands have witnessed the healing of physical, emotional, and spiritual wounds. It is here, that the right brain breaks free from the left while reaching into the heart and manifesting a vision for a better tomorrow.

The phrase ""Puech Ikots"" means ""words of our people"" in the indigenous Huave language of Oaxaca.</p>
<p>The collective creates alebrijes, which are brightly colored, traditional Mexican folk art sculptures of animals and fantastical creatures. The artists carve these sculptures out of wood and then paint them by hand.  Puech Ikots is fiscally sponsored in the United States by Cuentos Foundation in Chicago, IL, and their art is sold in both Oaxaca and Chicago. (If you would like to make a tax-deductable donation to this project via Cuentos Foundation, that is definitely possible!)</p>
<p>The finished film will be shown in Oaxaca and in Chicago to promote and support Puech Ikots. The artists are very eager to do this!  They created an 8-minute video about 2 years ago, with support from people in the United States (the Youtube link showing 2 minutes of this video is included in this campaign). They had no experience whatsoever with making videos, and creating the video was a very empowering experience for them.  The artists who have joined the collective since then were inspired by the video and want to create their own longer version, to share not only their art form but their lives and their community.</p>
<p>The funds from this campaign will go to pay for food and travel costs for the 2 main organizers of the collective to travel from Oaxaca City to the Oaxacan sierra, and spend a week visiting collective members and filming.  Any funds received above what is needed for the travel costs of the film will be given to the artists collective to buy artistic supplies (copal wood and paint), and/or better quality carving tools (as you can see from the video, the artists work with machetes and rough blades).</p>
<p>UPDATE: We are so grateful for the outpouring of support and for having reached our goal!  Some of the artists of Puech Ikots have been monitoring the progress of this campaign from Oaxaca via the internet and are very moved by the response we have had.  So THANK YOU!  Anyone who sees this campaign and feels moved to donate, please do, because although we have reached our $500 goal there is still so much that is needed for this project.  </p>
<p>The artists will use at least $100 (20% of the $500 we have raised so far) to buy paint, wood, and tools.  At least 20% of what we raise over $500 will go directly to the artists for that purpose.  But there are still supplies that must be purchased in Oaxaca in order to make the video recording- for example a tripod to hold the camera steady, and reflectors to maximize the light when recording the video (the surroundings will be very rustic, with natural light only, so reflectors must be used to maximize the sunlight/firelight that is being used for recording).  So, any donations beyond this point will be deeply appreciated and definitely put to good use.  Every donation makes the collective's lives easier.  Thank you again for your interest in this campaign, and please spread the word!</p></div>","We are raising funds for indigenous artists in the sierra of Oaxaca, Mexico to make a short film about their lives and their art.  The Puech Ikots artists collective was founded in Oaxaca, Mexico in 2009 to provide opportunities for these artists to improve their economic situation while also preserving their artistic heritage, and to share the culture and art of Oaxaca with a larger audience.

<span style="""">For the last six of those ten years we have been dreaming about combining our passions and our work. We knew they fit together, we just didn't know how. And so we waited and dreamed, went on long walks and planned hundreds of different kinds of shows and tours and visions. We followed our separate paths confident that someday they would merge again. </span><span style="""">And finally, that moment is here! As Jenstar worked on her sound healing work in Denver and Lou continued Priestess training and her art practice in Portland, the paths finally connected as we realized our vision of this tour: to share the power of sound and our voices with each other to create healing while being supported in a sacred installation altar. To blur the lines of a healing session and a musical show. To blur the lines of showing art while it is in process, letting it be shaped by the people around it and the experiences we share together. To not totally know what is going to happen, but to trust that what is supposed to be, will be. </span>

She believes in the power of vibration to help people tune into their truths, break through blocks, and activate/live your potential and purpose. Drawing on her background as a theater performer, musician and singer, she sees ritual and ceremony as a space to express ourselves fully. After working with the land and faerie energies for 10 years in Portland, Oregon, she now offers her healing services in Denver, Colorado. Though she misses the watery green of the NW, the expansive sun and rocky mountains is just what she needs to fully launch forth her business, JAHA Vocal Sound Healing. </span></div>

She loves helping others do that too. She weaves magic, ritual, and healing into her art practice in the creation of installations, book making, and fiber works. She is a dream analyzer, an animal communicator, and a maker of things. She is listens to the wind and to the water. She tends a home and the land in Portland, Oregon, where she hopes to someday soon understand the squirrels that climb around on the Elm tree.</span></p></div>

</div></div>","Who/What is JAHA+LOU?

JAHA+LOU is a collaboration between two queer witch priestesses: jenstar and her aura (JAHA) and lou lamotte. We are co-creating a healing ceremony / group sound healing session / sacred art installation / multi-media performance piece that we are taking on tour through 6 cities: 


Denver, Colorado
Santa Fe, New Mexico
Albuquerque, New Mexico
Tucson, Arizona
Los Angeles, California
Oakland, California

Funds raised from this campaign will cover:

Gas
Airfare (for Lou who is based out of Portland Oregon to Denver)
Food 
Printing shirts/totes to sell on tour
Design Services (to pay the artist drawing our images)
Materials to make Essences/Medicine on tour (bottles, alcohol, glycerine etc)
Materials for the Installation
Space/Venue Rental for 6 cities 


Our Dream
This September when we launch our tour is also our 10 year friend anniversary!

For the last six of those ten years we have been dreaming about combining our passions and our work. We knew they fit together, we just didn't know how. And so we waited and dreamed, went on long walks and planned hundreds of different kinds of shows and tours and visions. We followed our separate paths confident that someday they would merge again. And finally, that moment is here! As Jenstar worked on her sound healing work in Denver and Lou continued Priestess training and her art practice in Portland, the paths finally connected as we realized our vision of this tour: to share the power of sound and our voices with each other to create healing while being supported in a sacred installation altar. To blur the lines of a healing session and a musical show. To blur the lines of showing art while it is in process, letting it be shaped by the people around it and the experiences we share together. To not totally know what is going to happen, but to trust that what is supposed to be, will be. 

We are so excited to share this unique experience with you! To create it with you and let it expand and grow as we do.  Your support will directly affect our ability to rent spaces to hold our event. Many of these spaces require a deposit and your contribution will help us secure these places, as well as put gas in the car and pay for promotion materials to help get the word out. 
About us:
Jenstar and her Aura or JAHA, is a queer witch priestess who offers sound healing via the frequencies of her powerful voice. She believes in the power of vibration to help people tune into their truths, break through blocks, and activate/live your potential and purpose. Drawing on her background as a theater performer, musician and singer, she sees ritual and ceremony as a space to express ourselves fully. After working with the land and faerie energies for 10 years in Portland, Oregon, she now offers her healing services in Denver, Colorado. Though she misses the watery green of the NW, the expansive sun and rocky mountains is just what she needs to fully launch forth her business, JAHA Vocal Sound Healing. 
Lou LaMotte is a Queer Witch Priestess in training at the Blue Iris Mystery School in Portland, Oregon. She sees patterns in all things, from the feelings we feel to the connectedness of all that is, and loves to find them, untangle them, and purposefully reconnect them. She loves helping others do that too. She weaves magic, ritual, and healing into her art practice in the creation of installations, book making, and fiber works. She is a dream analyzer, an animal communicator, and a maker of things. She is listens to the wind and to the water. She tends a home and the land in Portland, Oregon, where she hopes to someday soon understand the squirrels that climb around on the Elm tree.

Real mail! Please check out the perks we are offering! 
We are looking at this as a sort of market place where you can purchase some of the amazing things we have to offer while also knowing that your money is going directly to helping us realize our dreams! 
If we don't realize our goal, we are still going on tour, so every bit helps. It might be a harder road to travel, but we know that we are called to this work! The bulk of our funds are going towards gas and venue rentals. In some cities we are renting out yoga or dance studios and they require deposits, and your support can help use secure these spaces for our tour. 
With your help we know we can make our goal! If you are unable to financially help, we totally understand, but we would love help sharing this campaign and letting people in your community know about it.
It is really so beautiful that with just a little bit we can all help each other live our dreams! 
Thank you so much! We send you so much love and gratitude!
Xoxo JAHA + Lou

<p>Hello all! My name is Dale Dupre' and I'm a 19 year old San Diego native with a bit of an issue. Currently I attend the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary, Alberta, Canada as a first year traditional art and jewelry student. I am now facing a situation considering money which is why I'm asking you all for your help. I have received a half-ride scholarship to ACAD along with financial aid, but I still fall short with funds. By being an international student, I am only able to pull out federal loans which has caused myself to pay the remaining funds out of pocket, which at this moment is not feasible. I have been practicing my craft for 16 years of my life, and this campaign will help me not only make it up to Canada, but will get me closer to becoming a professional artist. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>For this campaign, I'm very appreciative for whatever amount I can make especially in the economy we're currently in. This $2,000 campaign will all go towards getting myself up to Canada and paying off the remaining tuition I have left for this upcoming semester which starts in August. I will need to raise about $500 for my plane ticket to get to ACAD from San Diego, then $1500 will be used to pay off the last bit of my tuition. If this can be achieved, I will continue to attend ACAD in the fall and will be one step closer to completing my degree.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3>Through the remainder of the summer break, I will be working and selling artwork, but I'm relying on the last $2000 to get me all settled before returning to ACAD in the fall. <br/> <br/>

With our new location at 9:30 &amp; Esplanade we plan on making additions to our camp as well as upgrades to the Heart Phoenix bus.</p><p>Our Esplanade-facing space will include a standalone art piece with shaded structures for day events as well as a Dome for daily morning yoga classes, workshops, and night time sanctuary. We are upgrading the lighting on our bus to enhance the rising Heart Phoenix emblem on top, which serves as a beacon for our project and camp. We are in the process of upgrading the design for our bus to continue the experience all the way around our mobile structure. With these additions we will be greatly enhancing our home base events as well as our excursions into the open playa for day &amp; night escapades.</p><p>At our events in San Francisco over the past year, a lot of you have asked how you could help. Now is your chance to make Heart Phoenix more beautiful than ever.

</div></div>","Our story...Heart Phoenix is a group of veteran burners, artists, and creators with a unified mission of creating an experience for people to open their hearts and connect with one another through art & music.In 2013 we brought a bold vision to Black Rock City in hopes of spreading love and amazing music across the playa. The project was a success and we left with a overwhelming feeling of gratitude to the people who helped us along the way, and who danced with us from sunrise to sunset.
Our intent for 2014...From the day we left the playa we have been dreaming, planning, and constructing an improved design intended for Burning Man 2014. With our new location at 9:30 & Esplanade we plan on making additions to our camp as well as upgrades to the Heart Phoenix bus.Our Esplanade-facing space will include a standalone art piece with shaded structures for day events as well as a Dome for daily morning yoga classes, workshops, and night time sanctuary. We are upgrading the lighting on our bus to enhance the rising Heart Phoenix emblem on top, which serves as a beacon for our project and camp. We are in the process of upgrading the design for our bus to continue the experience all the way around our mobile structure. With these additions we will be greatly enhancing our home base events as well as our excursions into the open playa for day & night escapades.At our events in San Francisco over the past year, a lot of you have asked how you could help. Now is your chance to make Heart Phoenix more beautiful than ever. With your contribution to Heart Phoenix we can realize the experience we wish to bring to black rock city and it’s patrons of open minded people like you. What we need to raise money for…
Design: We are upgrading the design and lighting on the back-facing side of the vehicle with a beautiful new motif (see below). 

Lighting: A big lighting upgrade to increase illumination
of the Phoenix at night and to enhance musical performances by DJ’s and live
performers. We will be adding 4 moving-head robotic lights, lasers, and additional fixed lighting to make Heart Phoenix really pop at night.
Restoration and Maintenance: Additionally, our 40-year old British double-decker needed some additional love this year in the form of maintenance and upgrades. 
Transport: Finally, we are also funding the transportation needed to bring Heart Phoenix from SF to the playa this year. 







How you can help…
This year we
still need to raise $10,000 to bring back this immense work of mobile art and sound to the
playa.
Please
consider being a contributor to our campaign, and help us bring a magical
experience back to Burning Man for you in 2014. 
Love &
Gratitude,

<h3>What's Typecase?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Typecase Industries is a tight-knit design firm thought up and executed by three close friends. Based out of Washington DC, TCI is the cumulative aspiration to be the bosses we’ve always wanted. Specializing in letterpress, we offer full-scale design services and letterpress printing services for creative, inspired, like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise funds to move into a new (to be determined) location.... We are currently housed in a building of artists studios, but have definitely outgrown our space. In our new space, we will be able to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>offer more community workshops, including events for educators and students</li>
<li>participate and host community-wide art events</li>
<li>offer press and studio rental time</li>
<li>increase the amount and variety of our workshops</li>
<li>grow as a business</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money we're raising is going into any build-out costs and the moving expenses for a new location... these presses are heavy ya'll!! Anything after those expenses will go towards new and exciting equipment like a foil stamping machine, drill press, plate maker and tons of new type!! If we don't reach our entire goal, the money will still be put towards the building, and we will supplement the rest with loans.</p>
<p>From prints and cards to workshops and wedding suites, for your financial support, we've got a ton of great perks. Donate the full amount and we'll literally throw you a party in our new space!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since we started TCI a little over a year ago, business has been soaring! Your contribution will help us grow even more.</p>
<p>We believe that we are more than just a business and we are looking for a space that will help us engage with the DC community. In our new space, we will be able to offer more workshops - including letterpress, screenprinting and binding - as well as provide studio space for guest artists to run workshops, such as calligraphy and papermaking. We are also looking into some large community printing events as well as partnering with DC area schools to inspire and introduce young adults to the world of printmaking and discuss what its like to create and operate your own business.</p>
<p>We have never asked for financial contributions before, and have started our business with no loans and no debt. We are hoping that our past year of success will convince you all to believe in us as we take this huge step forward.</p>

<p>Dad and I have been invited to participate in a group show, titled<span><span><span><span><span> 'Re-generating Tradition', </span></span></span></span></span> featuring multi-generational collaborations. <br/>The show takes place in July 2013, in the Czech Republic, at Galerie Califia, in Horažďovice, about 3 hours South of Prague, by train.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.galeriecalifia.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.galeriecalifia.net/</a></p>
<p>For this installation, Ian Everard and I will construct a ship, made of driftwood, found on the shore of my home town of Santa Cruz, California. This is a re-enactment of a ritual from my childhood, when Dad and I used to gather driftwood, kelp and scraps of litter on the beach, in order to construct ""ships"", which we then christened, often with my grandmother's name, and set them sail, only to witness them disintegrate into the breakers.</p>
<p><span>""This year, in boat-form, I invoke our ritual.<br/> At the shore we gather driftwood and detritus.<br/> Your Cornwall recall blends with mine, of Capitola.<br/> We invoke our ritual of shibuilding, christening, casting off. S.S. Gwendolyn, for Grandmum.<br/><br/> Her ship surrenders to the waves.<br/> The cycle of work and inevitable loss.<br/><br/> I will hang a ghost of our ritual, in a Bohemian gallery, and wish for you.

Hi! My name is Pippa Possible. I am a Portland-based artist. I received my BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where I focused my practice in time-arts, and sculptural installation.
http://www.artslant.com/global/artists/show/168473-pippa-possible
http://www.saatchionline.com/pippapossible
recent exhibit: 2012 http://www.tanneryartscenter.org/ai1ec_event/art-as-experience-performance-art/?instance_id
 
My father is California-based artist, Ian Everard. 
http://www.artslant.com/global/artists/show/16847-ian-everard
http://ianeverardart.wordpress.com/
 
The Show, 'Re-generating Tradition', aka the reason for this campaign
Dad and I have been invited to participate in a group show, titled 'Re-generating Tradition',  featuring multi-generational collaborations. The show takes place in July 2013, in the Czech Republic, at Galerie Califia, in Horažďovice, about 3 hours South of Prague, by train.
http://www.galeriecalifia.net/
For this installation, Ian Everard and I will construct a ship, made of driftwood, found on the shore of my home town of Santa Cruz, California. This is a re-enactment of a ritual from my childhood, when Dad and I used to gather driftwood, kelp and scraps of litter on the beach, in order to construct ""ships"", which we then christened, often with my grandmother's name, and set them sail, only to witness them disintegrate into the breakers.
""This year, in boat-form, I invoke our ritual. At the shore we gather driftwood and detritus. Your Cornwall recall blends with mine, of Capitola. We invoke our ritual of shibuilding, christening, casting off. S.S. Gwendolyn, for Grandmum. Her ship surrenders to the waves. The cycle of work and inevitable loss. I will hang a ghost of our ritual, in a Bohemian gallery, and wish for you. Our ghosts will be projected onto her sail.""
The ship will hang from the ceiling of the gallery, as if floating, with a video of us beach-combing, and building the ships, projected onto the sail.
This is a collaborative piece, though I will be responsible for transporting and installing the work. This is my first opportunity to exhibit internationally. I am very excited to make this journey, and share this campaign with you!
 

What I Need & What You Get

In order to make my exhibition happen, I need to raise at least 2800 US dollars.    •    Travel expenses ie. planes, trains, and automobiles, hostels, etc: $2000     •    Materials: $300    •    Perks production: $500                                           Now, for those of you who wonder what you get out of your contribution, I would like to lay it out for you:
 
The satisfaction of supporting a huge, and fun, opportunity for me to exhibit internationally. It is my first international exhibit.
 
Giving me the opportunity to use that one semester of Czech I studied in College.
 
I have mutiple tiers of donor perks, and tears of eternal gratitude! it all depends on your budget, of course.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Having studied Art History in University, learned jewellery manufacturing, and working in an Electrical Engineering firm, I find myself in a unique position to create concepts that experiment with various materials and ideas. Over the past few years, I have dedicated a large amount of my own personal funds into creating and realizing concepts for paintings and sculptural paintings, and more recently, LED lighting pieces that bring together what has been developed with my structural paintings.</p>
<p><br/>With a long list of concepts for paintings unrealized, and a hope to create new prototypes for LED lamps, I hope, with your help, to finally give life to these unborn creations. You can visit my site at <a href=""http://www.MiesMo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MiesMo.com</a> for a glimpse into my own world and style.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>An estimated requirement for funding is $5,000. The majority of funding will be used for materials. Such materials include:</p>
<p><em>Paints (oil, acrylic, latex), Canvases, Electronics, Building Materials (Basswood, Cherrywood, etc.)</em></p>
<p>As I do create high quality prints of my pieces, contributors of any amount will be entitled to 10-15% discounts for any print(s) they wish to purchase, and/or other hand-made artisan pieces that catches you attention on my site. Other perk(s) are also available.</p>
If the goal of $5,000 is not reached, the funds that have been accumulated will be used to realize and complete as many of the concepts that can be afforded</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have had the blessing of having several of my works, be they paintings, structural paintings, lighting fixtures, contribute to the beauty and uniquness of several friends and clients home. I do strongly believe that the creativity and wealth of experience and knowledge that I have gained in the various, and seemingly unrelated facets of life, gives me an advantage in creating novel works of art that can contribute to artistic discourse and how we think about the role of art in our lives.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>My name is Ronny. I am a hobby photographer and motorcycle enthusiast. So I had the idea to combine these 2 favourite hobbies of mine and do something for a good cause in the process. This is how this 'hot girls on bikes' calendar came about.<br/><br/>At this point I am almost finished with the photo shoots. Each month of the calendar will have a different model on a different motorbike. All shoots are done on locations all over Ireland, so there's a bit of Ireland to be seen as well. All the bikes for the shoots were provided by Irish bikers free of charge . I have paid all models a modelling fee and have full copyright ownership of all images - so it's all above board.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Now here is where I need your help. All monies raised from the sale of this calendar should go to charity. The members of the biker community who supplied the bikes for the shoots voted for the National Council for the Blind in Ireland.<br/><br/>The plan is to print and sell 2000 of these calendars at a price of €10 each. I have already spent several 100 euros paying the model fees and travel expenses. The bikers who took part have supplied their bikes free of charge - now I need to get the printing financed. For this I need €2.200.<br/><br/>You can help in several ways. Obviously you can make a donation - however small or large - every $, €, £ or whatever your currency, helps and is much appreciated. You can just tell friends, family, or anyone else about this and ask them to help. Or you can just buy the calendar (or buy a few to sell on or give to people as presents) - see perks!<br/><br/>If I don't get the entire amount I will have to print less calendars, but the general idea will be the same. Please help me to make it a nice round number for charity though!<br/><br/>The sale of the calendar is already all but guaranteed (sale will be through a number of shops, online and a number of friends and family will sell them at work and to their friends, etc.)<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>By the nature of this campaign - being a calendar - the entire donation will be available to the charity by the start of the new year. Or, if it goes really well, maybe even for Christmas!<br/><p></p>

<h3>Association KROKODIL - Short History</h3>
<p><strong>KROKODIL</strong> <strong>started in 2009</strong> with the first edition of its literary festival. (Btw, you probably had no way of knowing that K.R.O.K.O.D.I.L is actually an acronym. In translation from the language of the region of the Western Balkans (formerly known as Serbo-Croatian) it stands for <strong>""Literary Regional Gathering Which Alleviates Boredom and Lethargy""</strong>. This was and still remains a perfect definition of our core mission - to help reconnect literary scenes of the region  ravaged by ethnic nationalism, series of brutal bloody wars that span throughout the 1990's and the violent disintegration of the former multicultural country known as Yugoslavia into petty ethnic states that sadly replaced it. Immediately after the success of our very first regional literary festival, we formed our <strong>i</strong><strong>ndependent and non-profit Association KROKODIL </strong>(<a href=""http://www.krokodil.rs/eng/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.krokodil.rs/eng/</a>), and under the aegis <strong>KROKODIL Engaging Words</strong> we introduced a myriad of different and unique activities of engaging words (KROKODIL's Writer-in-Residence program, KROKODOKODIL festival of literature and illustration for children, annual Belgrade Debate on Europe etc.), grew bigger in both size and importance for the whole decade and recently celebrated our tenth anniversary in a big way. </p>

<p><strong>Association KROKODIL</strong> positioned itself somewhere in the middle of the road between culture and activism. this formula helped us to become one of the most credible cultural institutions not only in Serbia and the region of the Western Balkans but in Europe too. Not so long ago we were <strong>awarded with the European Communications Award</strong> for our achievements in bringing audiences back to literary events.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>KCCL or KROKODIL's Center for Contemporary Literature</h3>
<p>The inauguration of <strong>KROKODIL's Center for Contemporary Literature</strong> is a next logical step in our development. Recently we rented a place in the middle of Belgrade's vibrant and dynamic Savamala creative district and now we dearly need your help in order to renovate it, transform it into a literary center, acquire necessary equipment and have it all set up and ready to launch as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We intend to turn these premises into a friendly venue for regular events, workshops, different readings and presentations of regional, European and global writers. The doors of <strong>KROKODIL's Center for Contemporary Literature</strong> will be open to our partners, visitors and fans, friends and curious minded individuals throughout the year. This will be a great new place to come and meet your favorite authors, attend different meetings, happenings and other cultural events but also to simply hang out with your friends.  </p>
<p><strong>KROKODIL's  Center for Contemporary Literature </strong>will be a non smoking, baby and pet friendly place that will provide high quality literary and cultural programs for all.</p>

</div></div>","Association KROKODIL - Short History
KROKODIL started in 2009 with the first edition of its literary festival. (Btw, you probably had no way of knowing that K.R.O.K.O.D.I.L is actually an acronym. In translation from the language of the region of the Western Balkans (formerly known as Serbo-Croatian) it stands for ""Literary Regional Gathering Which Alleviates Boredom and Lethargy"". This was and still remains a perfect definition of our core mission - to help reconnect literary scenes of the region  ravaged by ethnic nationalism, series of brutal bloody wars that span throughout the 1990's and the violent disintegration of the former multicultural country known as Yugoslavia into petty ethnic states that sadly replaced it. Immediately after the success of our very first regional literary festival, we formed our independent and non-profit Association KROKODIL (http://www.krokodil.rs/eng/), and under the aegis KROKODIL Engaging Words we introduced a myriad of different and unique activities of engaging words (KROKODIL's Writer-in-Residence program, KROKODOKODIL festival of literature and illustration for children, annual Belgrade Debate on Europe etc.), grew bigger in both size and importance for the whole decade and recently celebrated our tenth anniversary in a big way. 

Association KROKODIL positioned itself somewhere in the middle of the road between culture and activism. this formula helped us to become one of the most credible cultural institutions not only in Serbia and the region of the Western Balkans but in Europe too. Not so long ago we were awarded with the European Communications Award for our achievements in bringing audiences back to literary events.
 
KCCL or KROKODIL's Center for Contemporary Literature
The inauguration of KROKODIL's Center for Contemporary Literature is a next logical step in our development. Recently we rented a place in the middle of Belgrade's vibrant and dynamic Savamala creative district and now we dearly need your help in order to renovate it, transform it into a literary center, acquire necessary equipment and have it all set up and ready to launch as soon as possible.

We intend to turn these premises into a friendly venue for regular events, workshops, different readings and presentations of regional, European and global writers. The doors of KROKODIL's Center for Contemporary Literature will be open to our partners, visitors and fans, friends and curious minded individuals throughout the year. This will be a great new place to come and meet your favorite authors, attend different meetings, happenings and other cultural events but also to simply hang out with your friends.  
KROKODIL's  Center for Contemporary Literature will be a non smoking, baby and pet friendly place that will provide high quality literary and cultural programs for all.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>""Love. Not loss."" These three powerful words, put together by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), have profoundly changed the way I look at my work. For the past four years, my paintings have reflected my grief about the loss and degredation of ocean species and ecosystems. But it's love that makes us human, and love that ignites our passion to want to protect the natural world.</span></p>
<p>My new artwork, funded by this campaign, will find ways to talk about my passion and love for the ocean. It will explore the incredible life forms in coastal marine environments along the west coast of North America, from Baja Mexico to British Columbia. It will focus on the interconnections between species in specific local ecosystems, and also follow the migratory paths of both grey whales and Brant geese. Both these species winter in Baja, Mexico, and then migrate to north for the summer. Both arrive at Vancouver Island, BC, in March and are greeted by locals and conservationists alike.</p>
<p>This campaign will fund my time for three months of research and creation of new work, from January through the end of March. I'll spend February with the whales and geese in Baja, while learning more about the marine ecosystems there that support them. I'll then return north and head to Vancouver Island to see the whales and geese when they arrive in March, which also corresponds with the Pacific herring spawn. Wherever I am, I will continue to seek out local scientists and conservationists to learn more about different species and how they are interconnected.</p>
<p><span>My hope with the new work is to inspire others to learn more about the ocean and actively protect marine ecosystems for future generations. To this end, I will be donating the use of any of the images I create to non-profit ocean conservation organizations for their advocacy and awareness work.</span></p>
<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm an independent visual artist and writer based in Vancouver, BC, on the west coast of Canada. My art reflects my passion about the ocean as well as my concerns about climate change, habitat loss, pollution and overfishing. With my work, I support local environmental organizations engaged in ocean advocacy. I recently completed a successful Indiegogo campaign to fund the design and printing of a calendar of my ocean paintings and am donating part of the proceeds to The Dogwood Initiative and the Georgia Strait Alliance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding I receive will cover my regular living expenses so I can dedicate my time to research and creating new work. Because I'm ready to create a whole new series of work, an intensive period of study where I'm not working on other projects is essential.  </p>
<p>I'm looking to raise $6,000 to cover three months of living expenses. This is pretty bare bones but I'll make it work. I'm fortunate that my travel expenses to Baja and my accommodation there are already covered. If I raise less, I'll shrink my research time. If I raise more, I'll extend the amount of time I can keep creating and also be able to pay for guided boat excursions and snorkelling trips to see life underwater. </p>
<p>In return for your support, I'm offering a range of perks from personalized thank you cards and regular email updates to original artwork. All contributors will have the option of being recognized on a new ""Patrons"" page on my website.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
""Love. Not loss."" These three powerful words, put together by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), have profoundly changed the way I look at my work. For the past four years, my paintings have reflected my grief about the loss and degredation of ocean species and ecosystems. But it's love that makes us human, and love that ignites our passion to want to protect the natural world.
My new artwork, funded by this campaign, will find ways to talk about my passion and love for the ocean. It will explore the incredible life forms in coastal marine environments along the west coast of North America, from Baja Mexico to British Columbia. It will focus on the interconnections between species in specific local ecosystems, and also follow the migratory paths of both grey whales and Brant geese. Both these species winter in Baja, Mexico, and then migrate to north for the summer. Both arrive at Vancouver Island, BC, in March and are greeted by locals and conservationists alike.
This campaign will fund my time for three months of research and creation of new work, from January through the end of March. I'll spend February with the whales and geese in Baja, while learning more about the marine ecosystems there that support them. I'll then return north and head to Vancouver Island to see the whales and geese when they arrive in March, which also corresponds with the Pacific herring spawn. Wherever I am, I will continue to seek out local scientists and conservationists to learn more about different species and how they are interconnected.
My hope with the new work is to inspire others to learn more about the ocean and actively protect marine ecosystems for future generations. To this end, I will be donating the use of any of the images I create to non-profit ocean conservation organizations for their advocacy and awareness work.
About me
I'm an independent visual artist and writer based in Vancouver, BC, on the west coast of Canada. My art reflects my passion about the ocean as well as my concerns about climate change, habitat loss, pollution and overfishing. With my work, I support local environmental organizations engaged in ocean advocacy. I recently completed a successful Indiegogo campaign to fund the design and printing of a calendar of my ocean paintings and am donating part of the proceeds to The Dogwood Initiative and the Georgia Strait Alliance.


What I Need & What You Get
The funding I receive will cover my regular living expenses so I can dedicate my time to research and creating new work. Because I'm ready to create a whole new series of work, an intensive period of study where I'm not working on other projects is essential.  
I'm looking to raise $6,000 to cover three months of living expenses. This is pretty bare bones but I'll make it work. I'm fortunate that my travel expenses to Baja and my accommodation there are already covered. If I raise less, I'll shrink my research time. If I raise more, I'll extend the amount of time I can keep creating and also be able to pay for guided boat excursions and snorkelling trips to see life underwater. 
In return for your support, I'm offering a range of perks from personalized thank you cards and regular email updates to original artwork. All contributors will have the option of being recognized on a new ""Patrons"" page on my website.

<p><strong> Why Luxury Metal Prints are Super Fine like Cameron Diaz</strong></p>
<p>     I've been in the photographic industry for a long time now, most of my life in fact. When the metallic papers came out as a public option for printing, we photographers were super excited by the magical look they produced. </p>
<p>      Metal prints are a hi-def look into photographic print media, The technique creates the reaction you see when looking at a hi-def television.  I remember the first time I watched hi-def t.v. and saw all those rain drops falling on a football field during a game. When slowed down how surreal the impression was. It was like time stood still and you cold reach in and grab them.</p>
<p>      Trying to describe these prints is very difficult, so I will share a little personal story to illustrate the impact of a metallic print.  A few years ago at the back entrance to Yosemite, I ran into Justin Timberlake and some pro snowboarders chillen' on a park bench. This was a precursor of what was about to happen in the store.</p>
<p>      While waiting for the bathroom, I heard the lock click and suddenly like out of a movie everything slowed down, the door opened, smoke poured out of the room, an abundance of back light created a shadowy silhouette as a tall female figure moved towards me. A wind started to blow her hair as she entered the hallway with a giant smile..... I realized Cameron Diaz was walking right at me.</p>
<p>   I was thinking, ""Wow, I get to meet her"" when suddenly out of a side door, the store manager steps in front of me. I heard the sound of screeching tires as my lil moment crashed to a halt.</p>
<p>   It was rather surreal and very weird, sorta like an 80's teen movie. A weird science moment. (Kelly Lebrock anyone?)  MY jaw dropped because, as a fashion photographer, I have always respected the beauty of that young lady. The experience was forever trapped in my mind. It was awesome!</p>
<p>    These metal prints do the same thing for me and I hope that they convey a similar feeling or pattern of thought for those creative types out there that can touch, see and feel them. An eye gouging effect!</p>

<p> <strong>About the Artist's Journey through Life</strong></p>
<p>     My magnificent journey in art started more than 30 years ago in Northern California and has landed me in Los Angeles.  Visual aesthetics have been the driving force of who I am while I live my short existence in this lifetime.</p>
<p>         This Journey, has been inspired by art, fashion, design, music and an active lifestyle. I capture our world from this perspective.  My pictures are made and tuned by the magnificence of organized chaos mixed with technologies of various mediums.  Years of production practice, assisting other photographers, filming and making commercial art and visuals have paved the way for my own passion</p>
<p>      I see the world thru hyper-sensitive involvement.  I am on a constant search for ethical value, integrity, truth and dignity found in the knowledge collected by the greats from throughout history. I study not just how the masters use their tools, but also about their world beliefs and the system that afforded them a way of survival. Without getting political, I believe that I, as an artist, must capture our moments in time with my art.</p>
<p>      I lurk somewhere in the universe between black holes (shadows) and sunbursts (light) with integrity and intent to manipulate a vision with the light and shadows. I am constantly In-search of very clean / sterile environments of light or super dark and dirty cinema-graphic environments. Plus all of the varieties found in the middle.</p>
<p>     As a photographer, I love the subtle wrap of gradient that confirms form.  I love how the metal print and its reflective surface is elegant and compliments the fashion, yoga and dance inspired poses. These valuable and luxurious prints are a sign of our time and will be cherished for long after both the muse and I've been gone.</p>
<p>      I have been lucky to travel down some light and dark alleys and I have come out unscathed with a much deeper appreciation for integrity and purpose. I want you to have a piece of my journey. Made with love, integrity and truth, from my heart and soul.</p>

<p>Please help us launch an exciting art project off the ground, into the clouds and then back down to earth at dOCUMENTA(13)!  <strong><em>Itinerant Structures: Traveling Medicine Show &amp; Empanada Stand</em></strong> is a pop-up sculptural cafe and performance space operating in a fictitious economy, where theater, food and beauty are offered in exchange for ideas. The work will involve seven artists and premier August 2012 in Berlin with a gallery exhibition, curated dinner and public events. It will then go on to join the global discourse of art and thought at dOCUMENTA(13) in Kassel, Germany. We are running with the state of mind of dOCUMENTA, breaking down hierarchies between cultures and art forms. Join us in this endeavor to bust open intellectual, artistic and culinary straightjackets by contributing money to the <em>Traveling Medicine Show and Empanada Stand</em>!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for making a wild and beautiful idea possible,</p>

<h2><strong><em>About Us</em></strong></h2>
<p>Over the last 20 years, Elizabeth Dorbad and Ann Schnake have made sculpture, installation and performance works in museum and gallery settings, junkyards, health centers, meat lockers and street corners. With a lifelong interest in traveling circus and sideshows, Elizabeth had her first solo exhibition in a medical museum that specializes in human oddities. Her current installation works deconstruct theatrical forms and dissolve the boundaries between the space of sculpture and that of performance. Ann engages with the poetics of the body in failing economies by making installations, spare organs and parts, and performative meals, a labor informed by decades of work in hospitals and county clinics. We see the gates of art as permeable and are intrepid in bringing our friends, families, other artists and total strangers along with us. We operate with a premise of mixing mediums, stretching possibilities and doing what it takes to enact ideas while following singular threads to the ends of the earth. Our work and biographies may be viewed at:</p>

<h2><strong><em>Locations</em></strong></h2>
<p>This project’s nomadic trek will take us to three locations: the San Francisco Bay Area and the German cities of Berlin and Kassel.  We will begin in the Bay Area July 2012 and premiere in Berlin during the month of August with a gallery exhibition, choreographed artist dinners and pop-up events in public venues.  In late August, we will travel to Kassel to build a temporary installation and performance piece curated by the Critical Art Ensemble for dOCUMENTA(13). We are honored and delighted to intertwine the gustatory and the aesthetic as we become a part of the conversation, artistic production and ripple effect of dOCUMENTA(13) --this is a huge artistic endeavor for us! </p>
<p>Artists formed the first documenta in 1955 as an action that represented the banishment of the cultural darkness of Nazism.  Now attended by over 750,000 visitors, documenta occurs every 5 years, and lasts for precisely 100 days; it is considered by many to be the most important exhibition and site for ideas in the contemporary art world. Every documenta has wrestled conceptually and politically with the issues of its times and historically has become a source for defining and revolutionizing contemporary culture. </p>
<h2><strong><em>The Art!  </em></strong></h2>
<p>We are building a mobile installation and creating vignettes in various locations, from gallery to lecture hall to park, while bringing a five other artists into the mix. Imagine a visually evocative tent made of discarded materials, as installation, with props and characters to flesh out the scenario: wooden masks and limbs to create mobile identities; scrolls of essential questions such as recipes for potions to cure the ills of failing economies and social systems; a large tornado puppet that represents contemporary wilderness and upends order; soapboxes for standing on and walking over. </p>
<p>Performance artists in Berlin will help us enact these characters, from a confused waitress playing a violin to a bureaucrat grilling customers for illuminating thoughts. In this whirling space, we will periodically serve empanadas and slivovitz in exchange for ideas and create an atmosphere that invites chewing over thoughts. We have chosen empanadas, as a quintessential nomadic food, convenient for a traveler’s pocket. Since we will be enacting the project as travelers ourselves, the view from the road gives us playful boldness to build inclusive creative acts on an international platform. We imagine our empanadas and other tarts as an opening to conversations and engagements, a magical agent of erosion to artistic, social, economic, and geographic boundaries. </p>
<p>The <em>Traveling Medicine Show</em> is a mythologized tent, a mobile station, a symbol of the American Spring and of the people living on the borders of cities and economies worldwide. Early medicine shows hawked snake oil and ”Indian medicine” for curing ills, bringing ideas of the wild, magic and entertainment to the bored and the desperate of small towns. We will peddle the occult, cacophony and suggestion of the types of far reaching possibility that emerge from hurricanes and erratic weather systems, feminine wilderness, domestic kindness gone feral and good empanadas. </p>
<p>We are particularly excited about our collaboration as a convergence of our interests in itinerant structures…both architectural and societal, economies run amuck, and the physicality of eating and performance  --all wrapped around the colorful social platforms of both café and traveling medicine show! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By August 21st, we need to raise $8,000 to support the materials, travel, and logistics of this project, involving seven artists and thousands of viewers. </strong>Your  <strong>tax deductible</strong> contribution will support the making of sculpture, puppets, masks, a tent, a mobile cooking and serving unit and all the physical and performative elements of the <em>Traveling Medicine Show</em>. It will also support the airfare, train and other transport of the project along with support for our collaborators in Germany. Access to a kitchen and a studio will allow us to make sculptural pieces as well as hundreds of empanadas. In some instances there will be a charge for the food served, but the economy of a café where food is paid for with ideas offers a provocative platform; thus your donation will support a lively international discourse and a reimagining of value, exchange and property in dramatic economic times. </p>
<p>As artists we are enchanted to make art and products directly related to these themes specifically for you, to show our appreciation for your contribution. From cakes to Joseph Beuys handkerchiefs to theater and disaster photographs to cast bronze sculpture, we see these products as a rich part of our artistic production and an interweaving of objects with ideas that symbolize this particular body of work.  If you are interested in purchasing art and you do not see it here, now would be an excellent and helpful(!) time to do this.  Please contact us if interested!</p>

<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Please pass the word to people you know and ask them to do the same!  More support = more performance possibility and further exchange between artists and viewers internationally. You can also help us by giving us ideas—what do you think are the most pressing and radical questions to ask artists today? Send us suggestions of questions to pose to viewers at dOCUMENTA(13). </p>
<h2><strong>What Next? </strong></h2>

<p>Please help us raise money for Hope University’s YarnBombing Project!  Hope University is a fine arts program for adults with intellectual disabilities located in Anaheim, California.</p>
<p>At Hope University, we love to knit and make things with our hands.  One of our instructors, Sandra Carter, is a yarnbomber from Long Beach, California.  This made us think… We thought about coming up with a project that would make an impact on the community, let us use our talents and abilities, and let us share those skills with others.  What could be more perfect than a giant, massive YARNBOMBING made by people with and without disabilities?!  We wanted to create a physical and visual representation of how we are all part of the whole, and together we weave a beautiful fabric.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We pitched our idea to the Orange County Community Foundation and OC Arts, and they liked it and gave us $7,500!  The project will be installed at the Westfield MainPlace Mall in Santa Ana the day before the VSA Festival (a festival that celebrates the contributions of artists with disabilities), and then will be presented to the public on the day of the Festival, April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2013.  Although we received the grant, we need to raise an additional $7,500 to cover the cost of outreaching to at least 10 other organizations who serve people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The money you give us will provide for the cost of teaching others, providing the tools and materials they need to participate, and much more!  It will also provide funding for the first phase of the creation of a documentary about this project by filmmaker, Stephanie Serna.</p>
<p>What you will get , besides some of our great artistic perks, is the great feeling that comes from knowing you helped to put a smile on the faces of hundreds of people, both with and without disabilities.</p>

<h3>Saving The Art in Kids' Souls</h3>
<p>This campaign means the world to me!</p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to raise enough money and take my first steps to living out my dreams by having my very own art show in December 2012 which will directly benefit my mentoring group for teenagers where they can be exposed to the arts by attending a variety of arts and music events around the city on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As a high school teacher in Philadelphia for over 5 years, I was surrounded by teenagers that had so much talent and creativity in their souls but not enough resources and support to develop their skills in order to take them to the next level. I also spoke to many teens who told me stories about what went on after-school and during the weekends in their communities and how many of them had to stay in the house to stay safe and out of trouble. They were sort of like prisoners in their homes, sometimes left alone or to watch younger siblings, only to be entertained by tv or the internet. And many times I could see the dreams in their souls slowly fading away. I cannot, and will not, stand by and watch their dreams die! And neither should you.  </p>
<p>Saving The Art in Kids' Souls will eventually be a non-profit organization, a community center where teens can come after-school, on weekends, and during the summer to stay out of trouble, be creative, be successful, and achieve their dreams. Please help me take the first step in supporting our young people and help me to save the art in their souls by making a pledge and spreading the word to everyone you know! StaskinStudios thanks you for your support!</p>

<h3>Did You Know?</h3>
<p>Did you know that arts and music programs are being cut in schools across the city and nation? This is a travesty and it is one of the main reasons I am starting a mentoring group for teenagers involving the arts. The arts help to build creativity, problem-solving skills, and higher-order thinking skills in teenagers. And mentoring programs help teens to develop positive relationships with peers and adults while keeping them off the streets and out of trouble. Saving The Art in Kids' Souls will provide teens with access to caring adults while enriching their lives through the arts. </p>
<h3>Who Are You? A Tale Of Two Loves</h3>
<p>I am Shannon, also known as Staks, and I am a former high school teacher and an artist/photographer from Abington, Pa. a suburb outside of Philadelphia. When I was 10 years old I decided I wanted to be a teacher and I never veered off of that path until I resigned from teaching 3 years ago. At the same time I decided to be a teacher I would be at home setting up my dolls and toys for ""photo shoots"" and begging my mom to buy me black and white film. I tried to stay on both paths but somehow made a turn away from art. But your heart always brings you back to your true love and so StaskinStudios was born. My passion for art and photography grew stronger with the digital age but a part of me still missed the young people. So I decided to join my two passions together and here we are!</p>
<h3>About The Art</h3>
<p>I create music-inspired art and photography. I get a creative vision in my mind, I set up a photo shoot using everyday objects as well as elements from the musical world (I use lots of vinyl records!), take the picture, then alter it digitally using Photoshop until I get the look and feel of the art that I saw in my mind. My paintings are a fusion of art, music, and life. They are joyful and full of soul and I know that you will love them!</p>

<h3>Why An Indiegogo Campaign?</h3>
<p>I'm like Diddy but without the money or the people. Diddy is an ""idea man"". Love him or hate him, he has great ideas. I'm an idea woman. And now with Indiegogo I have the people (all of you!) and you have the money (or know people who do!). I have so many creative ideas to make really cool art for you all to enjoy and I have tons of ideas to help the young people in Philly be successful. I believe that Indiegogo is a great way to get people together for great causes and to help each other achieve our dreams!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/502587/pictures/full/20121022195617-DJ_Reign_copy.jpg?1350961015"" src="""" style=""width: 311px; height: 346px;""/></p>
<p>I have 1,100 facebook friends. If every friend gave just $4.55 to my campaign, I will reach my goal! OR if 200 people pledge $25, I will reach my goal! It's really not that much money if you have a lot of friends... so please be my friend and make your friends be my friend too! And don't forget...</p>
<p>WHEN YOU GIVE, YOU ALSO GET.</p>
<p>You will receive fabulous perks as a THANK YOU for your donation, as well as that awesome feeling you get when you make a difference in someone's life and they love you forever! Because...</p>
<p> I. WILL. LOVE. YOU. FOREVER. </p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/502568/pictures/full/20121022194801-godismusic.jpg?1350960488"" src="""" style=""width: 303px; height: 329px;""/>                                                                                                          </p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal (which is silly because I plan on surpassing it wth all of your help!) then I will still keep whatever funds I raise, you will still receive your perks, and I will still have an art show and follow my dreams.... but I may have to take on extra soul-sucking jobs that will leave me with no time, no energy, and no joy to fulfill my passions and make a difference in the wonderful ways I know I can! (Not to make you feel bad or anything.. )</p>
<h3>What Will The Money Be Used For?</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $5,000 in 40 Days. This is the absolute minimum needed.</p>
<p>4% goes to Indiegogo if I reach or surpass my goal. 9% if I don't reach it.</p>
<p>15% goes to the Thank You PERKS</p>
<p>20% goes to S.T.A.K.S. mentoring group</p>
<p>40% goes to getting my art put on canvas for the art show</p>
<p>15-20% goes to renting space for art show, marketing and promotions, misc.</p>
<p>**If I surpass my goal then I can give you more fabulous perks, I can give more money to my mentoring group, I can make more art, and buy some much needed art/photo equipment that I do not have.**</p>
<p>ALSO, 20% OF ALL MY ART/PHOTO SALES FROM HERE ON OUT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO MY MENTORING GROUP. SO PLEASE SUPPORT THE YOUNG PEOPLE!</p>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1) You can contribute funds and receive cool perks. Every dollar counts!</p>
<p>2) You can spread the word to your friends, family, co-workers, and random people you meet on the street!</p>
<p>3) Share my link on facebook, twitter, your blog, everywhere!</p>

<p>$5,000 in 40 Days....</p>
<p>WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER!! I BELIEVE IN YOU, ME, AND THE TEENAGERS!</p>
<h3>
<br/>P.S. FUN FACT</h3>
<p>Where did the name S.T.A.K.S. come from? I see it everywhere!</p>
<p>Well... Staks is actually my nickname. It is a play on my last name, Staskin, and friends and students used to see me working hard (and STACKING my cash) years ago to make more money and I was always making plans for my art so the name was created and it just stuck! It's catchy and interesting and so more and more people started calling me Staks, and I love it! Then, a few months ago, the English teacher inside of me saw an acronym in my nickname when I was thinking of a name for my youth mentoring group. It came so quickly and it was exactly what my vision for the mentoring group was... Saving The Art in Kids' Souls. I took it as a sign to move forward with my dreams and so that's what I'm doing! Right now!  </p>

The Impact


As we extend our support to small press and independent experiments in publishing and ephemera, we also attempt an aesthetic mix of the art of the moment. We borrow and cultivate the art and artists influencing us currently; the impact of such a process is always fresh, always varied.



Our process serves and exemplifies the visions and choices of alternative doing and making.





What We Need & What You Get


We need to cover our expenses, which are primarily day calls for technical assistance—lights, sound board, sound designs, set-up/strike, agent tabling and door/admissions. Additional underwriting we’ll use to pay for our supplies, including film and paper. We structure intended compensation along the lines of day stipends with priority given to technical assistance and facilitation of our core production values.


We definitively raise people’s labor over the acquisition of stuff!


With your donation you will receive an admissions voucher to Paper Kingdom along with a CD mix of collaborating friends’ music (originally a companion to the small press project Fragments). Packaged by hand with attention and care, the CD includes tracks by Marefumi Komura, Gretta Harley directing the Seattle Chamber Players, Climax Golden Twins, and a rare banjo solo by Jeffery Taylor.


For our voucher/CD incentive we ask for a minimum donation of $15. 
You also receive our sincere appreciation and thanks.


Other Ways You Can Help


We like reasonable volunteers. We also plan to present and serve oranges, tangerines, tangelos, etc., between media presentations. Consider bringing organic citrus fruit to share on August 11.

We have been interns with the North Carolina Art Therapy Institute since September, namely working twice a week in local schools with refugee children and autistic children. We have both learned a whole whole lot, namely that we both want to pursue expressive arts therapy as a career. Brian will be applying to Lesley University and Kaitlin will be applying to Appalachian State University for the fall of 2012. 

Do you know about expressive arts therapy? It is the jam. The International Expressive Arts Therapy Association defines expressive arts as the following:

<p>Roanna Shaundiin Shebala, aka Rowie Shebala, a Native American Spoken word poet from Fort Defiance, AZ, (7 miles north of the Capital of the Navajo Nation, Window Rock, AZ) is trying to find her way to Minneapolis, Minnesota to compete in <strong>the Women of the World Poetry Slam (WOWPS). </strong>WOWPS is a national poetry slam event where women from all over the country and Canada will be representing their poetry scene. After winning The Women of Phoenix Poetry Slam, she was honored to represent Phoenix Slam at this prestigious event. Though poetry is her passion she needs help getting to the competition. This is where you lovely people can help.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Asking for Your Help</strong></p>
<p>Please help me by donating to my fundraising campaign. I need to get to the Women of the World Poetry slam in Minneapolis, Minnesota from March 7-10, 2013. This will be covering my; plane tickets, hotel room, transportation (cab fare, bus tickets etc), and food.</p>
<p><strong>How Your Money Will Help</strong></p>
<p>I know when you're putting your money out there you would want to know where it is going, so here is a break down on what your generosity will be going towards.</p>
<p>Break down in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airplane Ticket: $500+</li>
<li>Hotel Room: $404.85</li>
<li>Food estimate: $120</li>
<li>Transportation (cab fare, bus tickets, etc.): $90</li>
</ul><p>Hope for the best and prepare for the unexpected is what I have always been taught. My estimate for this trip is about $1,120.</p>
<p>Whatever help I receive will be going towards me getting to WOWPS, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p><strong>Info on the Poet</strong></p>
<p>The first time I could remember writing poetry and enjoying the art was my sophomore year in high school. Since then I have been writing trying to grow and strengthen with my poetry, as well as my performance. In 2004 is when I first attended my first poetry slam in Flagstaff, AZ. I had no idea that poetry was turned into a sport where scores were given, performance and writing was judged, and most importantly the audience was involved. Later that year is when I first stepped on a stage and performed my first poem at a Poetry Slam. I remember being so scared that you could hear the paper as I shook on stage. After overcoming the fear of public speaking I have enjoyed my time performing my poetry on stage. Since then I have been on the 2011, and 2012 National Team, and this is my first year representing my venue at Women of the World Poetry Slam.</p>
<p>From the time in Flagstaff, AZ, I have moved to Phoenix Arizona, and have been a host, organizer, advocate, and poet to the Poetry scene here in my city. Poetry is part of my identity. So being able to represent Phoenix at the Women of the World Poetry Slam, I find this a great blessing in my life.</p>
<p><strong>How Else Can You Help</strong></p>
<p>I know there are times in everyone’s life where they have no money to help, but want to help, so what you can do is spread the word about my campaign. Send them this link, and let everyone you know, know. Thank you so much for your support.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Collaborative Artistic Experience:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Artist. Family. Community. Culture.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi!  My name is Amira.  I am an artist.  And I hope to reveal the power of a collaborative artistic experience within a family, a community, and a culture.</p>
<p>I used to think making art needed to be a solitary practice; that in order to fully focus and engage with the work, I had to be alone.  However, recent collaborative drawing and painting has inspired me to explore how an artistic collaboration can affect the people involved, and the final creation.</p>
<p>I started inviting family members to draw and paint with me.  My mom and I made several drawings using a blind collaborative process, wherein one person begins by drawing or painting a portrait of the other, and covers the work. Then the other person draws or paints a portrait of the first person.  The process is repeated until the paper is full of marks. Finally, the piece is uncovered, and the artists cooperate to resolve visual conflicts.</p>
<p>In alternative collaborative works, my mom and I worked simultaneously on one canvas using photographs of various family members, and children’s books from my childhood, as reference material.  Working side by side, this collaborative experience provided opportunities to observe each other’s technique and thought process the entire time.</p>
<p>I also collaborated with my father, brother, sister and nieces, and found meaning and inspiration in each experience. We were vulnerable, and we supported each other with mutual respect. We faced indecision and doubt, and were provided opportunities to help each other through confusing visual challenges. Throughout the process we paused for moments of reflection, observation, and communication.  We exercised patience and trust.  We abandoned control allowing for pleasant and unexpected surprises.  And in the end, both artists were excited to see how well each other’s portraits fit together to create a resolved composition.</p>
<p>I used to think making art needed to be an independent practice.  But I have seen that the risk of sharing a canvas or paper with another person can foster the creation of a truly intimate and raw finished work.</p>
<p>These collaborations have inspired me to wonder. Who else could benefit from sharing an intimate, trusting, and open-ended creative experience?  I believe there are people within families who could communicate better, connect more deeply, and love each other more after sharing a collaborative artistic experience.  Every single person has a different mind, frame of thought, pattern of reasoning – What if we provided a safe space in which people could create art together sharing their inspirations and beliefs?   I hope to discover that in collaboration we can resolve conflict.  By sharing the experience of making art with the people in our families, in our communities, and in our cultures, we can all learn something positive, something beautiful and something profound.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do I need your help?</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways your support will help me achieve my goals.  To continue exploring the artistic collaborative experience, I need:</p>
<p><strong>MORE ART SUPPLIES:</strong></p>

</div></div>","The Collaborative Artistic Experience:
Artist. Family. Community. Culture.
 
Hi!  My name is Amira.  I am an artist.  And I hope to reveal the power of a collaborative artistic experience within a family, a community, and a culture.
I used to think making art needed to be a solitary practice; that in order to fully focus and engage with the work, I had to be alone.  However, recent collaborative drawing and painting has inspired me to explore how an artistic collaboration can affect the people involved, and the final creation.
I started inviting family members to draw and paint with me.  My mom and I made several drawings using a blind collaborative process, wherein one person begins by drawing or painting a portrait of the other, and covers the work. Then the other person draws or paints a portrait of the first person.  The process is repeated until the paper is full of marks. Finally, the piece is uncovered, and the artists cooperate to resolve visual conflicts.
In alternative collaborative works, my mom and I worked simultaneously on one canvas using photographs of various family members, and children’s books from my childhood, as reference material.  Working side by side, this collaborative experience provided opportunities to observe each other’s technique and thought process the entire time.
I also collaborated with my father, brother, sister and nieces, and found meaning and inspiration in each experience. We were vulnerable, and we supported each other with mutual respect. We faced indecision and doubt, and were provided opportunities to help each other through confusing visual challenges. Throughout the process we paused for moments of reflection, observation, and communication.  We exercised patience and trust.  We abandoned control allowing for pleasant and unexpected surprises.  And in the end, both artists were excited to see how well each other’s portraits fit together to create a resolved composition.
I used to think making art needed to be an independent practice.  But I have seen that the risk of sharing a canvas or paper with another person can foster the creation of a truly intimate and raw finished work.
These collaborations have inspired me to wonder. Who else could benefit from sharing an intimate, trusting, and open-ended creative experience?  I believe there are people within families who could communicate better, connect more deeply, and love each other more after sharing a collaborative artistic experience.  Every single person has a different mind, frame of thought, pattern of reasoning – What if we provided a safe space in which people could create art together sharing their inspirations and beliefs?   I hope to discover that in collaboration we can resolve conflict.  By sharing the experience of making art with the people in our families, in our communities, and in our cultures, we can all learn something positive, something beautiful and something profound.
 
Why do I need your help?
There are several ways your support will help me achieve my goals.  To continue exploring the artistic collaborative experience, I need:
MORE ART SUPPLIES:
I currently use high quality acrylic paint, but now need to incorporate oil paint.  Oil paint has greater luminosity and more vivid color, both elements essential in creating art that strikes the viewer, affects emotion and allows for greater personal connection.
One of my goals for this project is to create several large-scale collaborative paintings, which require custom-built stretcher bars using wood and canvas.  I will need to purchase more high quality paper for drawings and watercolors.
SPACE: I now more than ever feel a deep need to pursue familial and collaborative painting and drawing themes.  I will need to pay for a larger studio space to create larger works and store the accumulated paintings and drawings.  In addition, the larger space will accommodate multiple people working collaboratively.
TIME: Painting takes time and hard work, from researching the subject, drafting preliminary sketches, preparing the canvas, mixing all the colors, taking time to reflect, and then paint, and then reflect again.
EXHIBITION: After completing a collection of paintings and drawings, and resolving my thoughts and observations, I want to share the work with you!  My goal is to rent a large space and visually convey what I have discovered.  I want this work to literally bring people together.  I hope this show will tell this story – in collaboration, we may solve problems and find truths.  There will be one large blank canvas on which all whom attend will make a mark.  We can be a community sharing a creative moment of vulnerability, honesty and positivity.
COMMUNITY OUTREACH:  Painting and drawing with my family is just the beginning.  I hope to further the collaborative artistic experience and include members of our community and beyond.  This will eventually involve applying for grants, volunteering with other families, renting community space, hiring assistants, and marketing.

<h3>LITTLE PHARAOH ARTS CENTER</h3>
<p>We've been offered an historic 6000 sq/ft building in the center of town, right in the center of Little Egypt. It will begin as an art gallery/event space and grow to become our performing arts center, complete with rotating gallery and community arts space.</p>
<p>Our President and Chief Executive Officer, John Clancy, spent thirty years in New York City with his wife Nancy Walsh working in and helping to create the independent theater sector. They ran venues in downtown Manhattan, presenting both new and acclaimed artists such as Leigh Silverman, Richard Maxwell and Sxip Shirey. They also produced their own work including Brian Parks’ AMERICANA ABSURDUM  <i>(“Perhaps the best combination of playwriting and production to come out of New York downtown theater in the 90s</i>.” Paper Magazine) and C.J. Hopkins’ HORSE COUNTRY (<i>a brilliant (and hilarious) critique of the emptiness of American life and the meaninglessness of the popular culture that attempts to fill the void.”)</i> Toronto Globe and Mail. They then toured their productions around the world winning six Scotsman Fringe Firsts at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and two Best of the Fringe Awards at the Adelaide Fringe.</p>
<p>John was honored with an OBIE award from the Village Voice in 2006 for Sustained Excellence in Direction and was the Founding Executive Director of the League of Independent Theater and Founding Board President of the Independent Theater Fund.</p>
<p>Now they have returned to John’s home (technically his grandparents’ Eugene and Eleanor Powers home, but John spent summers here as a boy in the 1970s) to launch their next adventure: Little Pharaoh Enterprises, Celebrating the Art in the Heartland.  </p>
<p>We welcome all ideas and counsel to help us accomplish our goals. If you are a local artist or know a local artist, please contact us. If you own or operate a local business and wish to help promote the area to a new outside market, please contact us. If you are a patron of the arts either locally or anywhere else and wish to hear more about our plans or wish to support our efforts, please contact us.</p>

<div> 
<p>ARTs East New York has supported the community of East New York for the past seven years; with
quality art programing, exhibitions, cultural exchange programing, and our
latest large scale project [re]New Lots Vendor Market &amp; Artist Incubator.
Our founder Catherine Green a resident of East New York started the organization
with the idea of providing quality art programing children in East New York.
ARTs East New York's mission has grown to use art as a way to address socio-economic
issues that affect East New York. Our capacity as an organization has grown and
so has our impact on the community. We at ARTs East New York focus our efforts
around 3 pillars; Economic Development, Health &amp; Sustainability, and
Community Life and Safety. </p>


We have named this campaign, ""Metamorphosis"" because our once
small arts organization is transforming. ""Phase II"" as we call it, is the transitions of ARTs East New York from a small local organization into a
regional leader of organizations  using art to change the
socio-economic issues of a neighborhood.<span> We see ourselves as leaders in the development of holistic health in low-income neighborhoods.</span> Due to the success of our
economic and social focused initiatives, ARTs East New York's impact and reach
in the community has increases greatly. Last years our programs &amp;

This mobile model for neighborhood revitalization activated two vacant lots towards leveraging socially engaged artists, supporting local entrepreneurs, and building community. As a one-stop shop anchored in the arts and rooted in community, [re]New Lots created a constant interplay between the arts and entrepreneurship, resulting in a renewable cycle of creativity, trade, and social exchange. All economic and artistic activity were cultivated by a professional development support system consisting of training’s, workshops, lectures, and networking events. </span>

</div></div>","The Metamorphosis of ARTs East New York
 
ARTs East New York has supported the community of East New York for the past seven years; with
quality art programing, exhibitions, cultural exchange programing, and our
latest large scale project [re]New Lots Vendor Market & Artist Incubator.
Our founder Catherine Green a resident of East New York started the organization
with the idea of providing quality art programing children in East New York.
ARTs East New York's mission has grown to use art as a way to address socio-economic
issues that affect East New York. Our capacity as an organization has grown and
so has our impact on the community. We at ARTs East New York focus our efforts
around 3 pillars; Economic Development, Health & Sustainability, and
Community Life and Safety. 


We have named this campaign, ""Metamorphosis"" because our once
small arts organization is transforming. ""Phase II"" as we call it, is the transitions of ARTs East New York from a small local organization into a
regional leader of organizations  using art to change the
socio-economic issues of a neighborhood. We see ourselves as leaders in the development of holistic health in low-income neighborhoods. Due to the success of our
economic and social focused initiatives, ARTs East New York's impact and reach
in the community has increases greatly. Last years our programs &
Initiatives included:



[re]New Lots Vendor Market and Artist Incubator -  This year as an organization marked an exciting period of dramatic growth as we launched the [re]New Lots Vendor Market & Artist Incubator. This mobile model for neighborhood revitalization activated two vacant lots towards leveraging socially engaged artists, supporting local entrepreneurs, and building community. As a one-stop shop anchored in the arts and rooted in community, [re]New Lots created a constant interplay between the arts and entrepreneurship, resulting in a renewable cycle of creativity, trade, and social exchange. All economic and artistic activity were cultivated by a professional development support system consisting of training’s, workshops, lectures, and networking events. 














Neighborhood Beautification
Mural
Mile - A mural and installation program that commissions artist from within the
community and abroad to produce vibrant and community reflective public arts
works in a designated corridor of East NY. 





Mi Tierra


AENY took a vacant lot in East New York and turned it into a community arts and recreation space. 




Education Programs 
YAI ""Young
Artist Institute""- Is our high quality art programing initiative that puts
talented and impactful artist-teachers in High School, Secondary and Elementary
Schools in East NY. The program includes after- school and Saturday programs. 



Apprenticeship


Our
apprenticeship initiative pairs artist with High School students, who learn the
the artists respective crafts, while discover themselves and their own art.








Artist Registry


Our
artist registry initiatives aims to map and create directory of every artist in
East NY and abroad who desires to be an active member of the art community of
East NY. 






Events 

ARTsPLOSION - Our Holiday Tree Lightening  is a
community celebration during the winter holiday season featuring live
performances, toy giveaways, and a tree lighting ceremony.



Summer Saturdays

Summer
Saturdaze & Nightz is an 8-week event series that combines a

<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>Listed below are some information about myself, the project and the significance of the work. </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Michael Mayosky and I have been painting murals for 30 years. Painting several historic murals across the country raging from Lincoln to Route 66 ranging in all styles and sizes.</li>
<li>I was commissioned by the U.S. Army to paint at the very spot the Revolutionary War started. The Military is paying for the mural but will only reimburse the supply costs upon completion of the work. The budget to get all tools needed is out of my own funds and contributors. I have reached my maximum budget already spent (3100.00), and  we need just a few more things to be able to paint the mural to completion.  </li>
<li>This mural is a total honor for myself and my family to be involved with. I want this to go as smooth as possible and there are always hurdles to jump towards the completion of the work. I have painted over a thousand murals and know what to do and what not to do. What to get, and what is not needed. Painting this quickly and accurately is only possible with the appropriate tools just outside my current budgets. </li>
<li>The paints I am using are extremely expensive but will be able to last at least 500 years. I want to do this mural without cutting any corners on cheaper paints. We want this to last decades upon decades.</li>
<li>This mural is depicting the scene that took place during the Battle of Brooklyn which started on July 4th, 1776. I am creating the work at the very spot it took place. To read up on the fascinating history of Fort Hamilton please start with this link, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Hamilton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Hamilton</a>
</li>
<li>Within the restrictions of the contract for the mural, I am not allowed to paint any side projects. This would be the normal procedure for me to raise more money for another project if budgets fall short. This is not an option for getting more supplies for this mural.</li>
<li>The real complicated part of this hurdle is that I recently lost my entire studio and personal tools due to a fire last summer. It has been very difficult to recover from the loss due to the fact all my tools and supplies were destroyed.  I have built up some, but I do need help at this point.</li>

<h3>Cold Weather Equipment Needed</h3>
<p>The purpose of the crowd funding campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaffolding. The wall is 12 feet high and under a larger awning. We will need to safely reach as far as we can go to get all surfaces clean and painted.  </li>
<li>Tarps and plastic. Creating a enclosed area to keep warm through the process will be outside my personal budget. I have already gotten the paint, several pieces of wood to build the structure and attached the tarps.</li>
<li>Rollers, brushes, spray tips, and other general items.</li>
<li>I have already purchased the paint and several other things. There is no specific goal so much as I just need everything I can get to help with the costs of the mural. The target I put is the absolute most I would need realistically. </li>
<li>The project has already started. I have cleaned and scrapped sections of the wall and the time to start priming and painting is coming within days. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Army is reimbursing us with the material costs when the project is completed. Some of the contributors, (if they choose to) will get the funds back. This will be arranged through a separate contract outside of Indigogo.  Please write me at michaeljmayosky@gmail.com for more information. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Artists need patron and sponsors sometimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>In this particular project, the amount of funding needed to paint this mural is greater than I can cover at once. I had lost all my tools earlier this year in a fire and I am still am recovering. However, even building back from devastation. you still need to create and work. This mural will be able to build my studio back in time but the tools still need to be immediately available. I unfortunately need help to replace these items to continue in my work.</li>
<li>Prints will be made of the is work and the people who help out will have the first prints made. Each print will be signed and numbered by myself and will surely be a great piece of history to share with your friends and family.</li>
<li>The history of this base goes all the way back to the first organized military action by the colonists in 1776.  Think of the thousands of soldiers who passed through this base on their way to the world stage is fascinating, from the Revolutionary, the Civil, and to modern engagements.

I imagined subscribers getting a package in the mail every few months, and opening it like a gift. I wanted it to be art that you could hold and touch and move.</p><p>So, I decided to publish editions of artist's books. I called my project <a href=""http://themetamerquarterly.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Metamer Quarterly</a>, picked the equinoxes and solstices for shipping dates, and started selling subscriptions in 2016. Issue #3, ""The Book of Love,"" will ship in June.</p><p>You could describe an artist's book as a book that is an art object. It borrows from the attributes of books – covers, hinges, pages, text – but also expands the idea of what a book can be. Artists' books don't reproduce art or images – they <i>are</i> the art. The subject is often reflected in how an artist's book is made, and what it is made of, as well as in text and image. </p><p>This format gives me both license, and some challenging boundaries. Each issue strikes a balance between originality and the need for reproduction. I plan to continue to use manual forms of reproduction as much as possible, like screenprinting and letterpress, and to always include elements that are drawn, collaged, handmade, and unique to each copy in the edition. This project is analog; its design and purpose are about physicality, objects, feel, and weight. It is art you can hold in your hands.</p><p>The first issue, “Metamerism”, came out in December of 2016: an accordion book made with heavyweight drawing paper, gel transfers, paint, rubber stamps, and containing a real glass prism. The second issue, “Maps and Diagrams”, shipped in March. It is covered in a durable bookcloth used for library editions. Inside, a folder with a star-shaped opening holds soccer coaching diagrams, an airport map turned poem, the night sky in gold leaf, and maps of childhood.

I imagined subscribers getting a package in the mail every few months, and opening it like a gift. I wanted it to be art that you could hold and touch and move.So, I decided to publish editions of artist's books. I called my project The Metamer Quarterly, picked the equinoxes and solstices for shipping dates, and started selling subscriptions in 2016. Issue #3, ""The Book of Love,"" will ship in June.You could describe an artist's book as a book that is an art object. It borrows from the attributes of books – covers, hinges, pages, text – but also expands the idea of what a book can be. Artists' books don't reproduce art or images – they are the art. The subject is often reflected in how an artist's book is made, and what it is made of, as well as in text and image. This format gives me both license, and some challenging boundaries. Each issue strikes a balance between originality and the need for reproduction. I plan to continue to use manual forms of reproduction as much as possible, like screenprinting and letterpress, and to always include elements that are drawn, collaged, handmade, and unique to each copy in the edition. This project is analog; its design and purpose are about physicality, objects, feel, and weight. It is art you can hold in your hands.The first issue, “Metamerism”, came out in December of 2016: an accordion book made with heavyweight drawing paper, gel transfers, paint, rubber stamps, and containing a real glass prism. The second issue, “Maps and Diagrams”, shipped in March. It is covered in a durable bookcloth used for library editions. Inside, a folder with a star-shaped opening holds soccer coaching diagrams, an airport map turned poem, the night sky in gold leaf, and maps of childhood. I had five collaborators on this issue, which was a real joy.Why Do You Need Funding?I am looking to make some things happen that require more time and money.

<p>DocNow
appeals to a diverse and expansive audience across Toronto and beyond. This
year’s festival pushes the boundaries of documentary by presenting the work of
international artists using new technologies, community partnerships, and
artistic innovation to tell unheard narratives from across the globe. </p>
<p>A sample of
what will be shown at DocNow 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li>An
     investigation into the impact of human rights violations in Kashmir</li>
<li>The
     challenges and tribulations of immigration for a modern Iranian-Canadian
     family</li>
<li>Intergenerational conversation
     around cultural traditions on the Sudanese-Canadian community</li>
<li>The
     significance of music within urban development </li>
<li>The
     history of a little known flight that uprooted a group of Vietnamese
     children from Saigon </li>
<li>A
     sensory immersive installation that explores the concept of ‘flow’ in
     sports</li>
<li>A
     project that uses 360-degree camera to observe a refugee family seeking
     sanctuary in a Vancouver-area church</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is
to showcase and support the hard work of all our graduating artists by making
an excellent arts festival in Toronto. Your donation will help make this a

</div>
<div>Every year we add something new to the course, growing it as best we can.  This year, we want to bring much more to the course, and to realize all our plans and dreams, we could use your help.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To get a little specific, here's what we have in mind:</div>
<div>We would like to increase the number of mushrooms in the forest, for which we need rebar, PVC piping, cloth, wire, and paint.</div>
<div>We would like to upgrade our lighting scheme from cheap solar garden lights to a deep-cycle-battery-powered LED system for our large obstacle mushrooms.</div>
<div>Transporting all this from the Bay Area costs us quite a bit, too.  Our trusty van, Preggers, has made the trip out the past two years, and we need to keep her well in shape to safely bring us out again this year.</div>

<h3>Bringing The Awesome</h3>
<p>A donation to our project will help us tremendously!  Be it $5, $50, or $500, every penny we receive will go in to making our course even better than previous years.  It is a wonderful feeling to bring our passion to the Playa and meet people who love the sport as much as we do and are surprised and stoked to see our project there.</p>
<p>Everything we can do to make everyone's experience better, we want to do.  Please donate today and come visit us this year at 2:00 and G!</p>

For the past four years, we, the Black Rock Disc Golf Club, have been dedicated to setting up on the 2:00 avenue our custom 9-hole disc golf course for players of all skill levels to enjoy.  We bring a mix of donated discs and our own custom-stamped BRDGC discs for everyone to use.  Last year we doubled our efforts and brought a light-up mushroom forest as scenery and obstacles for the course, to much acclaim.
We host two tournaments during the week (one during the day, one at night with LED-ed discs) and are expanding to offer technical clinics and putting challenges as well.
You can check us out on Facebook (linked below) to see pictures of our past courses and events.
