<h3>Refugee Fund</h3>
<p>Theatre is expensive and can be seen as exclusive. Many people don't think theatre is for them.  We are hoping, with your help, to make our play and the stories we tell, as accessible as possible to the people whose voices are represented on stage. </p>
<p>The simple plan for our refugee fund is to <strong>pay for 100 refugees to come to see our play, pay for them to get there and get home and participate in a series of workshops</strong> designed to explore journey, authenticity and communication. </p>
<p>The workshops will be practical and explore how we speak without language. We have experienced workshop facilitators and will provide a translator where necessary.</p>
<p>The show will run at <strong>The Space, London from 3rd - 14th April</strong> with the workshops taking place throughout that period. We will also travel to <strong>Brighton Fringe</strong> where we hope to continue this work.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3>What We Need</h3></div>
<div>
<p>The maths for this is extremely simple. We need <strong>£3000</strong> to pay the tickets, travel and workshop expenses for <strong>100</strong> refugees. The breakdown of this is as follows:</p>
<p>Ticket: <strong>£14</strong></p>
<p>Travelcard: <strong>£6</strong></p>
<p>Workshop Expenses: <strong>£10</strong></p>
<p>Total for one person: <strong>£30</strong></p>
<p>Our aim is to be able to pay for 100 people over the course of a the run. If we don't raise all the money, we will still be able to use whatever we have raised to fund as many people as we can.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution, however large or small, is absolutely crucial. </strong></p>
</div>
<p>There's also no need to stop at 100. Every pound we raise after our target will be used in exactly the same way! The more we raise, the more successful this will be!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Sleeper</h3>
<p><i>The Sleeper</i> is a play by, about and for refugees. <strong>It uses real testimony, real experience and asks some very real questions. </strong>Over the course of three years we have put together an hour-long experience which evokes the harrowing experience of hundreds of thousands of refugees, stuck somewhere between leaving home and finding a new one. It also recognises that we all need to do more than just watch a play about a crisis and urges people to take positive action. It's also, we must say, a cracking piece of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>The plot: </strong>An overnight train, somewhere through Europe. Karina, a very British writer, naively reports a woman sleeping in her bunk. Then it happens again. Forever connected by this simple action, these two women are played and replayed in the mind of a writer who examines the stories we tell each other and how we choose to tell them. This provocative and poignant new play weaves together the real testimony of Syrian refugees and the personal experience of writer Henry C Krempels.</p>

<h3>Anima Theatre Company </h3>
<p>Anima Theatre Company is focused on the faltering line between fact and fiction. Working in the realms of experimental theatre and new writing, we came together through our mutual interest in inclusive theatre and giving voice to those who struggle to be heard.</p>
<p><i>The Sleeper</i> (Theatre 503, Edinburgh Festival 2017, The Rosemary Branch Theatre, The Space and Brighton Fringe 2018) is a minimal portrait of a woman struggling to find refuge. But do we need to know someone in order to help them?</p>
<p>In each project we undertake, our aim is to promote cross-collaboration, conversation and connection while bringing new ideas and new audiences to theatre.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Will be huge! Our experience working with people who have been affected by the refugee and migrant experience has shown us the enormous benefits of seeing people like them represented through art. So far, we have had feedback which has, at times, been overwhelming and driven us to go further than ever before. </p>
<p>If we are able to reach out to 100 people, we are creating a new community of friends and a support network for people who need it. The impact of the play itself we hope will allow both people with different experiences to share a space, to develop a common language and appreciate our differences. </p>
<p><strong>If you pay for one person to get to the play, see it and participate in our workshop. You are building one more bridge. </strong></p>
<p>Our aim, as with all the projects, is to give a voice and a platform to stories that may otherwise go unheard. The simple reason for doing this play again is that we realised the positive impact it had on a small scale. We now need to reach farther and wider than ever before and, without this fund, we simply won't be able to do that. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over the past year we have gone deep into this story. It is, in our opinion, the defining question of our generation and we feel like these are things need to be talked about.And now! Our play relies on refugees being in the audience. It is about them. It is for them. It is by them. If we can't get people who have been through the refugee and migrant experience experience into the room, we will feel like we have failed. </p>
<p>We are already working with a number of charities who support refugees including The Refugee Women's Association. However, we can't rely on them. They are busy and have plenty on their plate. We have a dedicated 'outreach' strand to our production and the best way to ensure we can get to our goal is through there.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have experience. We just need the funds!</p>

<li>8 Performers $200 Stipend each = $1,600</li>
<li>10 Hours Rehearsal Studio Rental = $200</li>
<li>1 $200 Stipend to Hokum Arts to cover production costs = $200</li>

<p>The $200 stipend to Hokum Arts goes to the director/choreographer to cover the production fee (to the festival to rent the theatre).</p>
<p>We have several perks!</p>
<p>From mentions in the program and social media and exclusive background info and open rehearsal invites, we want you to be a part of the process. This is just the beginning of the work and we can't do it without you. The ultimate goal is to compose an evening of theatre based on the original script written by Louis DeVaughn Nelson. This festival will present dance excerpts from the larger piece. Help us develop this work by providing your feedback directly to us. </p>
<p>Overall you'll be helping to raise awareness about a very important issue - and this piece could travel to community centers and organizations to help raise awareness and to prevent others from falling victim to this common problem. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your contribution, all parties involved will be compensated and the work-in-progress will gain momentum for development of a larger work. </p>
<p>This project is important because this is a specific epidemic that isn't getting as much attention as the opioid crisis is in mainstream media. </p>
<p>Many of my works have had elements of sociopolitical issues and have raised awareness about topics including (but not limited to) domestic abuse/violence, eating disorders, bullying, sexual violence, racism, mental health issues and forms of discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the work will be disseminated to audiences proactively engaged in community building, as this is so much of what culture is about and much of the audience will be artists and members of the cultural community. </p>
<p>According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), crystal meth abuse and meth related deaths have been steadily on the rise for the past 5 years. </p>
<p>And with recent pending (possible) legislation in regards to opening ""safe injection sites"" spearheaded by NYC Mayor De Blasio, many outreach organizations are reaching out to the community about reducing the stigma of substance abuse illness and the need for more programming to save lives. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risqué subject matter is not the easiest to seek funding for though being excepted into a renown dance festival that has been running for five years gave me the courage and validation that this is an important work of merit and deserves a stage on which to be presented. </p>
<p>Male dancers are a hot commodity and get cast by bigger companies and are paid a salary for rehearsals. It's imperative that independent choreographers secure funding to get high caliber dancers. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge is finding folks who support the outreach aspect of this work (exposition of the tragedy of drug abuse amongst the gay community) in a meaningful way. </p>
<p>Because this work was accepted to be presented under a larger umbrella organization (The Sans Limites Company) it creates a set of obstacles for gaining support directly. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you own a local business or know someone who does - we would love to connect with you! By offering discount or gift cards we can promote your organization.

In our provocative work we depict the wounds we sustain fighting in the postmodern trenches in times of still existing patriarchy, neo-nationalism and fundamentalism. As ‘babys’ we reveal our vulnerability as humans.And now we are ready to make our next big step into the international art world. Your support will make this step much easier for us.We are bringing our immersive performance installation 'Baby Paradise' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the biggest festival for independent performing arts in the world. The Fringe is a platform for free artistic expression, following its mission of 'defying the norm' since 1947.Some people say that participating at the Fringe is a rite of passage for young artists. And yes, that's what it feels like: All will start with a road trip, when we travel the more than 1000km from Regensburg, Germany to Baby Paradise's new home in Edinburgh.For the full 27 days of the festival a bizarre underworld of desire and oppression will come to life: each day we will perform two shows – 'Baby Paradise - Part One' and 'Baby Paradise – Part Two'. By the time we return, we will truly be warriors. What we have to offer - Baby Paradise, a Barbie doll-playing playing prostitute in a surreal peep show'Baby Paradise' is a challenging feminist piece about power, sex, control. In our immersive performance installation nothing is safe or pretty. Baby is a prostitute and every person in the audience becomes her customer. A surreal peep show begins: As a specialist in interacting with Barbie dolls Baby uses them in surprising ways, as dildos, as cigarettes, as women's razors, as a toothbrush or a microphone. Over the course of two hours, Baby performs a grotesque revue of female roles and stereotypes, until she becomes a doll herself.'Baby Paradise' gives a voice to people that are marginalized in our society. Part of the inspiration for 'Baby Paradise' came from artistic director Anna's relationship with a sex worker.Especially sex workers face difficult living conditions everywhere in the world. And the fight against patriarchy and the angry white man’s rulership is not over yet. With 'Baby Paradise' we are joining this fight.'Baby Paradise' is a project we have been working on for the last three years. It all began, when Anna was attending a Master class for 'self-generated theatre' at Stella Adler Studio of Acting New York City three years ago. Since then we have been refining it and have also created the short film 'Baby Paradise'.Meet 'Baby Paradise' at C venues during the Fringe Why support us?We ask for your support, because - apart from the challenges most independent artists have to face when it comes to funding their projects - we are currently cut off from any local funding.After in March 2018 the Regensburg Department of Culture censored our performance ‘My home is not my home’, we have been heavily attacked by the local press and several institutions. Since then we have become outcasts in our own community, as reported by Regensburg Digital and Puls, Bayerischer Rundfunk.      In our current position we can only rely on the support of a community of like-minded people who believe in the freedom of art.We will bring 'Baby Paradise' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in any case, because this is our calling. To follow this vision, however, we will have to use up pretty much all resources we have left. Our friends and family support us in every way possible but this will only get us this far.We have to pay for travel, accommodation, set and venue. At this point our helpers (and ourselves) have to work for free, although they deserve some compensation for the effort they put in.By supporting ‘Baby Paradise’ you become a part of a unique artistic project that gives a voice to the ‘others’ in our society. Our promise is to make art that isn't there to be likeable, to be compliant, to please the needs of institutions or that compromises.If you support us, you support freedom of art and people that fight for their vision, not only for ourselves but to share it with others. For a better world to come! How you can help?Every financial contribution you could make, however big or small, makes a big difference to our project.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This is a very big year for Kybele Dance Theater (KDT) as it's a very important chance to leap from a small local-based company to more of an established, touring company. We are invited to perform at the Peridance Capezio Showcase at New York's Association of Performing Arts Presenters (APAP) in January 2016. This is the largest convention in the world where all the big companies, venues, presenters, and producers meet to find out about new companies they could be interested in to present in their upcoming festivals, events and performances for upcoming seasons. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Beside performing at Peri Dance, KDT is producing 3 more half evening shows at City Center and Ailey Studios open to the public for FREE</span>. </p>
<p>Our campaign is to take KDT's 6 dancers and company manager to New York to perform and network.</p>
<p>Contributors are not only helping to get the company to travel to New York for the performances but also molding and shaping the future of the company ... and fulfilling an American dream</p>
<div></div>
<div>I'm Seda Aybay. I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey. I found my passion for dancing when I was 5 years old and began my journey with ballet, jazz and tap. After graduating from high school, I begged my parents to let me go to the States to continue studying dance/choreography and discovered modern and contemporary dance. After studying at Santa Monica College, UCLA, Alvin Ailey and performing with various companies and choreographers, I found my creative artistic voice and started to create contemporary pieces to tell stories by fusing Turkish imagery. I am the founder, artistic director, and choreographer of Los Angeles-based contemporary dance company Kybele Dance Theater (KDT) since 2003. These past 12 years I have created many works and have been refining my creative, unique vision. My works have been performed and toured thoughout different parts of the USA.<br/>
</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Goal</h3> <p>Our goal is $14, 615 to take the company to New York and be a part of the APAP Conference, January 15-19, by performing as well as attending the conference and its various workshops and sessions while also networking and spreading the word about this young, exciting, new dance company.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Airfare: $3200 </p>
<p>Hotel: $4000</p>
<p>Conference fee: $2495</p>
<p>Conference Badge Device: $500 </p>
<p>Showcase Listing: $70</p>
<p>PR materials: $1000  </p>
<p>Rehearsal: $1,500</p>
<p>Per diem: $1,850<br/></p>
<p>————————————————————</p>
<p>$14, 615</p>
<p><br/></p>Our stretch goal is $24,000 to pay the performers and everybody who worked so hard to create this project. It is sad that while usually the production's venue is supported, the dancers, choreographer, costume designer, lighting designer, and company manager who create the production are not. We believe everyone should be paid for their hard work. So if we can get past the bare bones of just getting to New York and performing, we would like to support all the artists who made that dream a reality.</div><div>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use whatever funds we do get towards the airfare and conference fees. If we must couch-surf and spend 5 days ramen noodle-eating, it will still be worth it!  Dance is the dream and every penny counts towards making that dream come true.<br/><ul> </ul> </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>Dance is living, breathing poetry.  It is being created at that moment to be experienced live.  Dance reflects the inner soul of the artist and mirrors the world we live in, giving meaning to our society and bringing beauty and depth to it and to all who participate in it.  Contributors are not only helping to shape society's better self but by extension are also the audience for this piece. I live to dance but it cannot have meaning without the audience.  My contributors are my audience and together we are breathing new life into the arts, keeping it fresh, modern and cutting edge.</div><div>
<br/><div>KDT has produced full-evening programs, been invited to festivals, as well as commissioned to create pieces in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Fresno, Concord, San Jose, Palm Desert, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and New York.</div>

This is the largest convention in the world where all the big companies, venues, presenters, and producers meet to find out about new companies they could be interested in to present in their upcoming festivals, events and performances for upcoming seasons. 
Beside performing at Peri Dance, KDT is producing 3 more half evening shows at City Center and Ailey Studios open to the public for FREE. 
Our campaign is to take KDT's 6 dancers and company manager to New York to perform and network.
Contributors are not only helping to get the company to travel to New York for the performances but also molding and shaping the future of the company ... and fulfilling an American dream

I'm Seda Aybay. I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey. I found my passion for dancing when I was 5 years old and began my journey with ballet, jazz and tap. After graduating from high school, I begged my parents to let me go to the States to continue studying dance/choreography and discovered modern and contemporary dance. After studying at Santa Monica College, UCLA, Alvin Ailey and performing with various companies and choreographers, I found my creative artistic voice and started to create contemporary pieces to tell stories by fusing Turkish imagery. I am the founder, artistic director, and choreographer of Los Angeles-based contemporary dance company Kybele Dance Theater (KDT) since 2003. These past 12 years I have created many works and have been refining my creative, unique vision. My works have been performed and toured thoughout different parts of the USA.
    Our Goal Our goal is $14, 615 to take the company to New York and be a part of the APAP Conference, January 15-19, by performing as well as attending the conference and its various workshops and sessions while also networking and spreading the word about this young, exciting, new dance company.

Airfare: $3200 
Hotel: $4000
Conference fee: $2495
Conference Badge Device: $500 
Showcase Listing: $70
PR materials: $1000  
Rehearsal: $1,500
Per diem: $1,850
————————————————————
$14, 615
Our stretch goal is $24,000 to pay the performers and everybody who worked so hard to create this project. It is sad that while usually the production's venue is supported, the dancers, choreographer, costume designer, lighting designer, and company manager who create the production are not. We believe everyone should be paid for their hard work. So if we can get past the bare bones of just getting to New York and performing, we would like to support all the artists who made that dream a reality.If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use whatever funds we do get towards the airfare and conference fees. If we must couch-surf and spend 5 days ramen noodle-eating, it will still be worth it!  Dance is the dream and every penny counts towards making that dream come true.    The Impact Dance is living, breathing poetry.  It is being created at that moment to be experienced live.  Dance reflects the inner soul of the artist and mirrors the world we live in, giving meaning to our society and bringing beauty and depth to it and to all who participate in it.  Contributors are not only helping to shape society's better self but by extension are also the audience for this piece. I live to dance but it cannot have meaning without the audience.  My contributors are my audience and together we are breathing new life into the arts, keeping it fresh, modern and cutting edge.
KDT has produced full-evening programs, been invited to festivals, as well as commissioned to create pieces in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Fresno, Concord, San Jose, Palm Desert, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and New York.

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I was born 6 months before the Genocide in Rwanda began and my family was marked for slaughter. We escaped to Scotland and after living there for almost 10 years we returned to Rwanda. I returned to a home that I had never known and that I struggled so painfully to understand. How could the genocide have happened? Why did it happen? Could it happen again? Where was the international community? In face of what happened in 1994, what was the meaning of humanity? At the age of 12, I was blessed to join Mashirika Performing Arts Group and the rest, as they say, is history. Through Mashirika I learned about my culture, my history and more importantly, I learned about myself. Music, dance and drama woke me up to a deep and profound understanding of humanity and the role we all <b>MUST</b> play  (no pun intended) to recognize, affirm and love all humanity. </p>

In school performances by Full Radius Dance are designed to reinforce curriculum, such as character education and science, and can also serve as a meaningful way to get students of all ages involved in discussing critical issues such as negative beliefs about self-image/identity and disability awareness. PLUS it’s very entertaining to watch!   What We Need 

As we ramp up for the 2015/16 school year, we need your support to help us reach our goals to reach kids through dance in the following ways:

Studio space rental for choreographing and rehearsing our programs for the 2015/16 school year
Props and costumes for performances
Transportation funds
Outreach materials to raise awareness of our school performances


   The Impact 
 In the 2014/2015 school year, our two programs reached well over 2000 students.  We are on track to triple that number next year.  ""The Legend of the Dragon,"" designed for K -5, provided a message of cooperation and empowerment, featuring audience participation and conflict resolution techniques.  Our second program ""Let's Get Physics, Y'all!"", developed in partnership with the Georgia Institute of Technology, illustrated basic principles of physics in an unforgettable way, while also demonstrating the power of teamwork and diversity.

<br/></div>","We're excited to let you know about the
world premiere of Never Never, a play by Alexandra Petri that Barabbas Theatre is producing  in the 2015 Capital Fringe Festival. This will be the first play produced by Barabbas
Theatre!
Known for past Capital Fringe hits such
as Miss Emma’s Matchmaking Agency for Literary Characters and
Tragedy Averted, and for her
humorous opinion pieces in the Washington Post, playwright Alexandra Petri takes a dark
turn with Never Never. The play, which draws parallels to J.M.
Barrie’s Peter Pan stories, is about a man with deviant tendencies. He’s worked
hard to keep from acting on his predilections but now faces his greatest
temptation. It’s a poignant, troubling drama, but, like all of Alexandra’s
writing, it’s also hysterically funny. To perform Never Never, we’ve cast four of the best young actors in the DC area: Lizzi Albert, Seth Rosenke, Matthew Sparacino, and Latia Stokes.

The Alba Method was developed in the 1970s by psychologist Susana Bloch. Alba presents the actor with a combination of breathing patterns, postural attitude and facial expressions, enabling the actor to have access to these six basic emotions; Tender Love, Anger, Sexual Love, Fear, Joy and Sadness. Exploring these six emotions with a different intensity, on a scale of 1-5, enables the performer to access a wide variety of emotions. The actor can also explore combinations of the 6 in order to find a wider range. Alba is believed to give the actor more control over their emotions and leaves the actor with more mental stability, Alba requires the actor to portray the emotion physically which will then enable the actor to feel the emotion inside. Wanting to explore Alba even further we had the idea to create a piece of theatre using Alba as a starting point. The idea we had was to get ourselves into a workshop space, put ourselves into an emotion of our choosing, by using the Alba technique, then improvising a scene while in that emotion. The pure reason for this being our initial idea of creativity is that we had researched a lot about actors using Alba in TV, film and theatre as a way of them approaching a text and portraying their character's emotions within the text, but we had never come across any use of Alba as a creative and writing tool. So that is exactly what we wanted to do. I’d say 80% of our final performance was created this way, the rest being written without the aid of Alba in order to link certain parts together to enable them to flow.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

The founder is honoured figure of culture of RA Gagik Ginosyan. The group has gathered a number of ancient dances and songs and raised them on the stage. But there are a number of material which are needed to be digitalized. Now the Scientific Center wants to this work.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I am Charlotte Johnson a Dance Artist here in the St. Petersburg and Tampa Bay area of Florida. I was blessed to grow up in a community that supported the education of young dancers, however when it comes to thriving as a professional dance artist, we have a long way to go. After Studying in New York City and returning back to my hometown, I believe my purpose and desired obligation it to help build the professional dance community. My gift has always been to draw the audience into my world and the world that I create while on stage. I know that God has called me to evoke a shift and a movement in someone's life which is my true heart's desire with the vision of Journey to Freedom. This project will also offer more opportunities for the professional dancers and performers in the area.</p>
<p>As a backer your contribution will help bring this passion project to life and really aide the artist and audience members who are desperate for a change, and a shift in their lives.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>

<p>All of these components cost money and are a necessity for this work. JTF may struggle moving forward with out your help.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I know that JTF will have a positive impact on the community because I believe that this is a project that speaks to one's own personal battles, and struggles and literally portrays life on stage. Whether they are apart of the work in a creative way or someone in the audience, this work will not only plant a seed but actually begin to evoke a movement in their lives.</p>
<p>Journey to Freedom was first performed on Sarasota Contemporary Dance Company in December of 2018 and prior to that it was work shopped on SCD's summer intensive dance students. In both of the creative opportunities some dancers and audience members shared with me the impact that it had on them emotionally and what it meant for them to be apart and/or a witness to this work.</p>
<p>This is my hope for all who are evolved.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Amelia Sciandra, I founded the company Borderline Confrontational, and I need your help to make my dream come true. I wrote a play that is an adaptation of the Trojan War myth. An LGBT love story between Achilles and his companion Patroclus, <i>Glorious, but Brief</i> is a collision of the classics with seemingly modern themes. </p>
<p>The show will have its world premiere at the Bread &amp; Roses Theatre in Clapham. They're a great space for showcasing new work because they don't charge companies with rental fees. But they do take a split of the box office. So we need your help to fund the show. </p>

<p>Borderline Confrontational has a track record of success. Indiegogo contributions helped us make our show <i>Fugitive Songs </i>a great success at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, and helped fund our terrifically successful run of <i>Godspell </i> at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2016. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Thread is the new play by provocative playwright Freya Alderson. Directed by Veronica Quilligan and produced by The XV Theatre Company.  At the heart, Thread is about family ties and how they sometimes weave a tangled web of conflicting emotions, particularly when the family is fractured by the ricochet of dementia and secrets from the past. A story about those who suffer from dementia and those who care for them. </p>
<p>A personal piece of theatre for many of the creatives involved, as they have family members suffering with dementia. We aim to educate and challenge perceptions, whilst providing an evening of electric theatre with some of the best talent the UK has to offer. </p>
<p>We are delighted to have been offered a 3 week run at the award winning The Hope Theatre, Islington, but we need your help to truly bring this important piece to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your support!</h3>
<p>Helping support this piece will allow us to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're raising funds to pay all our actors the Equity Minimum Wage, so we can bring as much awareness about the disease as possible. </li>
<li>We set a target goal of £4500 (though we'd love to raise even more!)</li>
<li>The productions costs will be approx £7000 but we are investing in this project ourselves. </li>
<li>Whilst we are confident the box office will be a success, £4500 will ensure that all our creatives are paid Equity Minimum Wage, something the XV Theatre feels passionate about. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Theatre Company is not aiming to take any profits from the show. After covering costs all the profits will be reinvested into future productions. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we performing this play? </h3>
<ul>
<li>Around 850,00 in the UK have dementia, though those suffering stories are rarely heard</li>
<li>Unpaid carers supporting someone with dementia save the economy £11 billion a year. This is driven by their love and friendship for the sufferers -  something that is honoured and highlighted in this play. </li>
<li>Research and understanding is vital. This play aims to show solidarity to carers and seeks to educate those who have misjudged those with the disease. </li>
<li>We aim to raise awareness for this vital cause. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Us?</h3>
<p>We are an emerging theatre company and have already managed to produce some plays with some lovely reviews: Here are some reviews of our previous works:</p>
<p>“Baby Mine is a quiet show with stewing, building suspense. A bona fide<br/>thriller... ” Broadway World </p>
<p>“ Her final decision right before the blackout, hit the audience like a<br/>powerful wave, and I even shed a tear. Baby Mine Is a good show, but<br/>what’s more important is that it truly has the potential to be outstanding.” Fringe Review</p>
<p>“Beautifully nuanced and complex writing about sex, love, power and<br/>obsession.” Simon Nelson, BBC Writers Room</p>
<p>""The set is beautiful,""The set design of Erini Kariori is quite masterful. The use of Umbrellas is brilliant."" Richard Brain, London Pub Theatres (Perfect Pitch, The Tabard Theatre 2018)</p>
<p>""A smashing production!"" Penny Flood, ChiswickW4.com (Perfect Pitch, The Tabard Theatre 2018)</p>
<p>Why You?</p>
<p>Any help you can offer us will be so gratefully received. We are passionate about theatre, writing, and paying our artists a fair wage. We feel this play is an important comment on the dementia crisis that is too often hidden behind closed doors.</p>

<p>(<i>Wahine Group</i>) <span>When Kamanu first discovered the beauty of hula she had believed it was a gift reserved for the natives of the land. Sadly pushing away any dreams of learning hula, she went on to study jazz, ballet, tap, hip hop, modern dance as well as her native Chilean Cueca dances. It wasnʻt until she settled into an acting career in Los Angeles that she reconnected with an old college friend Kehaulani who was studying to be Alakaʻi at Hula Hālau Nā Mamo O Panaʻewa. It was there she learned that hula was for anyone with a passion to learn it and perpetuate the culture.  After over 20 years of dance and 2 years of papa hula, she finds herself in her second E Hula Mau® competition and just as in love with the art as she was as a child.

<h2><b>Pits: The Unauthorized Holes Musical</b></h2>
<p>The Yelnats
family has been having a string of bad luck. Well, that’s putting it mildly. They’ve
been cursed since Elya Yelnats forgot to carry Madame Zeroni up that dang
mountain. Elya didn’t realize that someday his mistake would send his
great-great-grandson Stanley to a youth correctional facility in the middle of a
seemingly endless desert. Now, an innocent Stanley has to dig holes for
eighteen months - all the while dealing with antagonistic
juvenile delinquents, a devilish warden, and a mysterious search for
a lost treasure. And don’t forget the yellow-spotted lizards!  What a
riot!</p>
<p><i>PITS: The Unauthorized Holes
Musical</i> is an original show that pays hilarious tribute to Louis
Sachar’s brilliant story while simultaneously celebrating the weirdness,
passion, imagination, and innovation of our creative team. We’ve assembled an
amazing cast of triple-threat superstars to create the musical we’ve all dreamt
of since middle school. On April 15, the show will finally come to life - and
we hope you’ll be there to see it.</p>

<h3><b>Where the Money is Going</b></h3>
<p>You might be
thinking, “That budget sounds wild. How long have you been stranded in the
desert, deliriously eating sploosh?” But we thought it out, I swear. Our primary
expense is theater space; our goal is to put the show on in a professional
theater. You might be thinking “Just put it on at NYU! You go to school there,
right?” RIGHT! But NYU only gives performance space to theater clubs. Even
then, the spaces available are not fit for musical theater. Unfortunately, we
are not a registered theater club and have no way of getting to that point
without waiting out a very long process. The most inexpensive space available  for our performance schedule costs about $3,000.</p>
<p>In addition to
that, we have to pay for costumes, props, set design, lighting, and sound
equipment, all of which puts us back another $2,000. Thus, we arrive at our
budget of $5,000.</p>
<p>Admission to
the show will be totally <b>FREE</b>! I said it, <b>FREE</b>! But by donating, you can land yourself
a guaranteed reserved ticket to the performance of your choice! </p>
<p>If we don’t
reach our intended goal, our funding will go entirely to performance space.</p>

<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>I first saw <i>Holes</i> in movie theaters when I was
eight. It immediately became my favorite movie. My obsession didn’t falter
through middle school, and in high school it was something my friends wouldn’t
let me live down.  So when junior year rolled around, no one surprised
when I waltzed into school on Halloween dressed as Stanley Yelnats, blasting the
movie’s theme song from speakers in my backpack.

<p>When I got to
college, as a film major, my late nights were filled with cliché philosophical
conversations and the occasional snooty film question of “What’s your favorite
movie?” I avoided the classic answers like <i>The
Shining</i> and the blatant lie of <i>Citizen
Kane</i>. Instead I embarrassingly blurted out, “<i>Holes</i>!” before thinking of a lie that would have given me more
credit.</p>
<p>I
wrote the first song of the show my junior year of high school. Not long after,
my writing lost steam and the song was left alone for four more years.
 But on one magical day last year I nostalgically remembered my experience
in high school musical theater and sat down at the piano to finish what I
started.</p>
<p>I ended up with a show that pays tribute to one of my favorite
stories of all time, while also poking a good deal of fun at it. It's a show
that can make any millennial feel nostalgia for their days of Tamagotchis and
 middle school crushes. We hope to make you fall in love with Holes all
over again.</p>

<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
<p>Preparing and
performing a full-blown musical production is no easy task. Although we've
started with a great story and wonderful characters, there are <i>literally
</i>MILLIONS of hurdles we have to jump.</p>
<p>From creating
an original score, to choreographing complex dance numbers, to working out
budgets and creating an interesting set with authentic props, the process of
creating a show of this magnitude is rife with difficulties.</p>
<p>Over the course
of the next month, the amazing cast and crew of <i>Pits </i>is going
to be toiling tirelessly away to bring to life a truly unique and delightful
musical. The challenges along the way will (hopefully) only make the final
product that much better!</p>

 middle school crushes. We hope to make you fall in love with Holes all
over again.

Risks & Challenges
Preparing and
performing a full-blown musical production is no easy task. Although we've
started with a great story and wonderful characters, there are literally
MILLIONS of hurdles we have to jump.
From creating
an original score, to choreographing complex dance numbers, to working out
budgets and creating an interesting set with authentic props, the process of
creating a show of this magnitude is rife with difficulties.
Over the course
of the next month, the amazing cast and crew of Pits is going
to be toiling tirelessly away to bring to life a truly unique and delightful
musical. The challenges along the way will (hopefully) only make the final
product that much better!




Other Ways You
Can Help

If you can't
chip in here because you've blown all your cash on trying to find a cure for
smelly feet, there are still so many ways you can help!
First and
foremost, come check out the show! It's going to be a blast, and we know you'll
love it. Also, if you want to help spread the word, tell some friends about the
project. You never know how quickly news can spread!




Finally, if
you really want to help out, you can get involved artistically
in your own community. This is a story about friendship, camaraderie, and
overcoming the roles that society has thrust upon you. Music and theater have
an incredible power to make the world a better place, so do your best to spread
it around!

Three seemingly disconnected characters search for a sense of community in London's rapidly disappearing gay scene.

Louie sleeps on the circle line all day in-between finding work as a male prostitute.

Why this show would suit The Edinburgh Fringe 
It’s current. It’s about contemporary issues that are affecting people right now. With 25% of London LGBT venues having shut since 2009 the play attempts to foresee what could happen if London's gay scene disappears at the current rate.
The play not only examines this crisis in relation to the increase in London property prices but also the rise of gay social media. Since London was the most popular city in the world for Grindr in 2013 (with 947, 000 users) we feel the play is not just current but urgently needs to be told.


With two characters in their teens and one in his late 50s the play depicts the changing faces of London’s gay scene and how ‘normal’ means of communication have been replaced with instant messaging, photos and unsolicited offers of sex. The age difference between the characters also seeks to capture the contrast between old and new attitudes towards HIV and the play foregrounds this within the current refugee crisis, considering how migrants could so easily be denied HIV treatment given Nigel Farage’s comments in the build up to the 2015 election.


However the play also tells a very personal story. It is a story about society’s outsiders, their battles with loneliness and their search for belonging in a world that does not want to necessarily accommodate them.

As an organisation that was set up due to the exclusion of those not included in the 1947 International Festival, The Fringe appeals to us as the perfect place to perform this play.

Who is Shake on the Lake? 
 Professional Shakespeare Outdoor Festival and company based on Silver Lake, New York
Founded by Josh Rice, a theatre artist born, raised, and practicing are on Wyoming County's Silver Lake
Produced four seasons of live theatre: The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged), The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Nights Dream, and The Tempest

Host a cast and artists from Little Rock, Chicago, New York City, Nashville, Jacksonville, and Perry Donations from people like YOU! help us bring Shakespeare's Twelfth Night to Western New York this summer!

What is Shake on the Lake planning for 2016?


Twelve Shows of Twelfth Night! That's right, we are producing the fantastic fête of Twelfth Night a dozen times in Western New York. With your support, we can share this magical party throughout the region. Help bring Shake on the Lake back to our rural venues by contributing to this campaign!


Shake on the Lake visits Arcade, New York (Wyoming County)   What We Need & What You Get What do we need with this holiday fundraiser?  We need at least $2,000 to fund our traveling show: production costs, travel costs, sound system, marketing, and staffing!
Shake on the Lake pays its theatre artists. We not only believe that art contributes to the quality life of our festival towns, but also believe artists should be paid for their craft.  Shake on the Lake is launching educational programming and needs support with programming costs and artists fees to develop curriculum and our first ever student actor ""Green Shows"" that will premiere before some of our Twelfth Night shows. No matter if we meet or exceed this goal, the funding will go towards festival expenses.  


We travel to perform rain, shine, and extreme heat! The Tempest at Mt. Morris, New York (Livingston County)
   The Impact Your contribution will impact:  Our local residents: some seeing Shakespeare on stage for the first time in their communities Our communities: Shake on the Lake draws audiences from the immediate community as well as regional and national audiences making towns a theatre destination while we are in town increasing traffic to local businesses and visits to the wonderful communities and venues we perform in Our company: we host several actors from throughout the country who temporarily call Silver Lake and Western New York their home.  
   Challenges & Opportunities

<p>Once upon a time, a band of weirdos found each other in the muck and tumble of San Francisco.  They built themselves a cardboard palace called Circus Automatic.  In this palace, they created terrible things, beautiful things, things that had never before seen the light of day.  Stories too real to be true, and feats too rare to exist.  Circus Automatic is stirring with a new creation for the Great Star Theater that challenges you to delve further into the labyrinth of the Raised by Wolves series.</p>
<p>If you’re local to the Bay Area, perhaps you have joined us for some of our <a href=""http://www.circusautomatic.com/upcoming.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previous creations</a>.  </p>
<p>For our newest show we are pulling out some big ideas that have been years in the planning; this is definitely our most ambitious project to date, and we need you and your kind support to help us bring it to life!</p>
<p>Into the Mouth of the Wolf debuts October 13th at the Great Star Theater, in the heart of the China town district of San Francisco.  Production is well under way, and we have 30 days to raise enough funds to bring our giant to life before our preview date of August the 20th.</p>
<h3>What we need to pay for:</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $7,800....WHOA!  These funds are needed for the following production costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>No biggie we just plan to envelop the Great Star Theater in a giant starscape, that's all. (you'll see)</li>
<li>Giant trees that create creepy shadows on stage</li>
<li>Materials and construction costs for inspiring costumes</li>
<li>Printing and promotion to get the word out</li>
<li>Rigging costs to fly people in the air</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why you should support this production:</h3>
<p>Supporting Circus Automatic means:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>THIS IS A BIG THING - there are a lot of moving parts to this production and resources are always thin- our people and supplies juggle multiple responsibilities to pull off our shows. Each production is a labor of love that manages to assert itself every time.  Staging a full length production in the United States is no small feat, and we want to continue pushing the boundaries of our art forms, not simply produce something that will pass.  We need your help to make this one the best ever!</li></ul>

Fools!</h3> <p><span>We are the Department of Fools!!!!  We are a new Commedia dell’Arte troupe presenting an original production titled A HISTORY OF SERVITUDE as part of the 20th Annual New York International Fringe Festival this August! <br/></span></p>
<p><span>We are very excited to announce that all of our performances at the Fringe are absolutely FREE to the public!!!  While we are thrilled to offer free comedy to NYC audiences this summer, we still have costs to cover.  Not a single artist is being paid for this project, nor will audiences have to pay to see it.  This is a labor of love in the purest sense.  Please help us in providing free hilarity this summer?<br/></span></p>
<p><span>A bit more about us:  The Department of Fools is internationally diverse, with performers from<span> India, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Morocco, Norway and the United States</span>.  We all share a passion for satire, social justice, and the unique hilarity of mask work. </span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Starting in January of this year, we spent several weeks of workshopping through improvisation, physical exercises, mask work and learning the history of Commedia dell'Arte.  Since then, we have developed a few original shows and started to share them with the public. After two very successful productions at the NYU Gallatin Arts Festival and at the prestigious Lee Strasberg Film &amp; Theatre Institute we are bringing A HISTORY OF SERVITUDE to the NY International Fringe Festival this summer! </span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span></span><i>A History of Servitude</i> is a comic survey of world
history, from the dawn of man to the present.<span> 
The play examines and celebrates the eternal struggle of the
underdog.  History remembers men (and to
a much lesser extent women, which we point out as well) of greatness, who
through conquest, innovation and accomplishment have left an indelible mark on
the story of man.  But what about the
servants of these giants?  Using the
boldly physical slapstick comedy of Commedia dell’Arte, we bring attention to
the contributions of the working class throughout history, which all too often goes
unnoticed.  What if Einstein’s maid is
actually responsible for inspiring the General Theory of Relativity?  What if Shakespeare got most of his ideas
from the janitor at the Globe?  Slaves
built the pyramids, but it’s the pharaohs whose names live on.  <i>A
History of Servitude</i> posits a comic reminder that ‘the little people’ are
the ones on whose back much of history rests, despite the fact that the masters
get all the credit.</span></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>We need your help in providing free comedy to NYC audience this summer! So what will your hard earned money be used for? We are looking to raise $3500 for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Press Rep and Public Relations ($2000) <br/></p></li>
<li><p>Costumes and Props ($750)</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing ($500)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>AND if we exceed our goal, maybe we can buy a meal for our hungry actors (who are all working for free)!!! #artistlife</p>
<p>Literally every dollar you give (and yes, even one dollar helps) make a huge difference!<br/></p>
<ul><br/></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your donations will help us to costume our actors, get the show reviewed by major press outlets, and help spread the word about our very special show. But most importantly, you will be supporting free theatre for NYC audiences.  While our great city offers some of the finest theatrical performances in the world, few people can afford the exorbitant ticket prices.  Providing free theatre is part of our commitment to serving our community regardless of commercial concerns.  You can help us achieve that!</p>
<p>From the very inception of our company, all of our productions have been free to audiences.  Audiences have roared with laughter and loved our shows.  We want to continue to bring quality comedy to audiences for free, but we can't do it without your help.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The Department of Fools is a company of a dozen gifted and highly trained actors, who have worked on TV shows like QUANTICO and have appeared on stages around the world.  However, all of the Fools work for free on our shows because they love the work and want to bring the work to audiences without having to charge an arm and a leg.  In order to do that, we rely on the generosity of like-minded individuals who love comedy, mask work and just being silly!  <br/><br/>If we don't meet our goal, we will survive.  We are a scrappy and resourceful bunch.  We will find a way to get the basics needed to bring a fine show to Fringe audiences this August.  However, literally every dollar you donate will help to improve the production values of the show, but even more importantly your donations will help us spread the word about our show to audiences and press alike.  We want to let people know about what we are doing, and continue to do it for free.  Please help us make that possible?<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some of you might not be able to contribute, and that's really ok.  Times are tough for many, and as actors in NYC we know how precious every dollar can be.  But even if you can't give, you can still help us!  Please consider doing one or more of the following:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Help make some noise about our campaign.  Link to it on your Facebook or Twitter accounts!</li>
<li>Help us get the word out about the show!  Again, post on your Facebook or Twitter about this fun and free production happening this summer:  <a href=""http://fringenyc.org/special-events/fringeal-fresco/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fringenyc.org/special-events/fringeal-fresco/</a>

Starting in January of this year, we spent several weeks of workshopping through improvisation, physical exercises, mask work and learning the history of Commedia dell'Arte.  Since then, we have developed a few original shows and started to share them with the public. After two very successful productions at the NYU Gallatin Arts Festival and at the prestigious Lee Strasberg Film & Theatre Institute we are bringing A HISTORY OF SERVITUDE to the NY International Fringe Festival this summer! 


A History of Servitude is a comic survey of world
history, from the dawn of man to the present. 
The play examines and celebrates the eternal struggle of the
underdog.  History remembers men (and to
a much lesser extent women, which we point out as well) of greatness, who
through conquest, innovation and accomplishment have left an indelible mark on
the story of man.  But what about the
servants of these giants?  Using the
boldly physical slapstick comedy of Commedia dell’Arte, we bring attention to
the contributions of the working class throughout history, which all too often goes
unnoticed.  What if Einstein’s maid is
actually responsible for inspiring the General Theory of Relativity?  What if Shakespeare got most of his ideas
from the janitor at the Globe?  Slaves
built the pyramids, but it’s the pharaohs whose names live on.  A
History of Servitude posits a comic reminder that ‘the little people’ are
the ones on whose back much of history rests, despite the fact that the masters
get all the credit.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We need your help in providing free comedy to NYC audience this summer! So what will your hard earned money be used for? We are looking to raise $3500 for:

A Press Rep and Public Relations ($2000) 
Costumes and Props ($750)
Marketing ($500)

AND if we exceed our goal, maybe we can buy a meal for our hungry actors (who are all working for free)!!! #artistlife
Literally every dollar you give (and yes, even one dollar helps) make a huge difference!
   The Impact Your donations will help us to costume our actors, get the show reviewed by major press outlets, and help spread the word about our very special show. But most importantly, you will be supporting free theatre for NYC audiences.  While our great city offers some of the finest theatrical performances in the world, few people can afford the exorbitant ticket prices.  Providing free theatre is part of our commitment to serving our community regardless of commercial concerns.  You can help us achieve that!
From the very inception of our company, all of our productions have been free to audiences.  Audiences have roared with laughter and loved our shows.  We want to continue to bring quality comedy to audiences for free, but we can't do it without your help.

  Risks & ChallengesThe Department of Fools is a company of a dozen gifted and highly trained actors, who have worked on TV shows like QUANTICO and have appeared on stages around the world.  However, all of the Fools work for free on our shows because they love the work and want to bring the work to audiences without having to charge an arm and a leg.  In order to do that, we rely on the generosity of like-minded individuals who love comedy, mask work and just being silly!  If we don't meet our goal, we will survive.  We are a scrappy and resourceful bunch.  We will find a way to get the basics needed to bring a fine show to Fringe audiences this August.  However, literally every dollar you donate will help to improve the production values of the show, but even more importantly your donations will help us spread the word about our show to audiences and press alike.  We want to let people know about what we are doing, and continue to do it for free.  Please help us make that possible?
  Other Ways You Can Help Some of you might not be able to contribute, and that's really ok.  Times are tough for many, and as actors in NYC we know how precious every dollar can be.  But even if you can't give, you can still help us!  Please consider doing one or more of the following:  Help make some noise about our campaign.  Link to it on your Facebook or Twitter accounts!
Help us get the word out about the show!  Again, post on your Facebook or Twitter about this fun and free production happening this summer:  http://fringenyc.org/special-events/fringeal-fresco/

  Nuff' said. If you don't laugh, we'll give you a full refund!! Guaranteed!!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><a href=""http://playfulsubstance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Playful Substance</a> is excited to present <strong>Frank</strong>, a play by Grant Harris, as a full stage production in October of 2016. </p>
<p>Grant Harris is a writer and actor residing in Brooklyn, New York. Grant's written works have been percolating with the encouragement of LAByrinth company members as well as LAB's extended family for the better part of two years. Most recently, his play <i>The Boy Finds Love</i>, enjoyed a reading at LAByrinth's theater on Bank Street in Manhattans West Village. As a co-founder and artistic director of Playful Substance, Bree O'Connor has worked as a producer, writer, director and teaching artist for nearly 20 years. Both Midwesterners at heart, Harris and O'Connor struck a creative partnership during LAByrinth's 2014 Intensive retreat in Connecticut. <strong>Frank </strong>will be their first public collaboration.</p>
<p><i><strong>Frank</strong></i> has enjoyed two well-received public readings in 2016. The cast for these readings featured young veterans of the downtown scene, including </p>

<p>We are indebted to them for the contributions they have made to the development of <strong><i>Frank</i></strong>!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need!</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $15,000 to cover expenses for a limited run of 8 performances in a unique space that will transport you from the streets of New York City to a Midwestern world of homecoming dances, cornfield keggers, angry guitars, and a sky so wide and empty that it may open up and swallow you whole.</p>
<p>Here's what that entails:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal and Performance Space Rental plus Insurance Costs = 30% of total budget</li>
<li>Stipends for Creative and Production Staff = 20% of total budget</li>
<li>Materials for Sets, Costumes, Props, Lighting and Make-Up = 20% of total budget</li>
<li>Promotions, Printing Costs,  and Graphic Design = 15% of total budget</li>
<li>Guest Services: Concessions, Applicable Licenses, Servers = 10% of total budget</li>
<li>Miscellaneous = 5% of total budget</li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution will provide materials necessary to explore creative lighting design, the unique use of sound to define both time and space (possibly a new pop tune or two?!), as well as a small stipend for our every member of our staff and creative team.</p>
<p>More importantly, your contribution helps keep our ticket price affordable!</p>
<p>Our perks to you, our generous supporters, will include tickets to performances, producer credits, signed memorabilia, and even an invitation to peek behind the curtain at our final dress rehearsal and enjoy dinner with the cast!</p>
<p>In the event we do not reach our goal, we will need to pare down our operation to the bare minimum to make it happen. We will first apply our funds toward our rehearsal and performance space costs as well as our mandatory insurance. After that, we will need to provide for creative solutions to the technical needs of the show including sets, costumes, props, lights, etc. We may be unable to bring in designers to help realize the vision of our show and we may have to ask our actors and our production staff to donate their time to make <i><strong>Frank</strong></i> a reality.</p>
<p>And <strong><i>Frank </i></strong>needs to be a reality.</p>
<p>Playful Substance and No Name Theater Company are committed to bringing this examination of rage and American promise to the stage. Yes, <strong><i>Frank </i></strong>is entertaining, It's fun! However, one of the greatest benefits of storytelling is how the good stories <i>stick. </i>They get under your skin and you can walk out of the theater a little different than when you came in.</p>

WHEN: Tues. Aug. 2, 9:00 PM, Wed. Aug. 3, 6:15 PM, Sat. Aug. 6, 6:00 PM


WHERE: Hudson Guild Theatre, 441 W. 26th St., NYC NY




THE PLAY:  After a fall off the bluff behind her house, 40-year-old pregnant Jude Black descends into a coma, confined to a hospital room. The identity of her child’s father and the circumstances surrounding her pregnancy remain a mystery. As the play unfolds, the families of her best friend and her nurse
unexpectedly collide, forcing them to uncover the festering secrets that bind
them all. Yet, even in this twilight state, she comes to grips with the failures and traumas of her life that led her to attempt suicide.
There hasn't been a play like BLUFF in a very long time and it's sure to cause a stir. 
Our creative team is passionate, diverse, connected and experienced enough to get this play to the finish line... with a little help from you, of course!



    The Impact As tender as it is intense, BLUFF is more than just a play about six people whose lives intersect and implode. It's a door to a discussion that will continue long after you leave the theatre.  If you've ever wondered if someone in a coma knows you're there, then this play will have special meaning for you. It's built on the premise that not only can someone in a coma understand what's happening around them, they can synthesize that experience.
End of life issues are especially timely and the debate over coma consciousness continues to divide the medical community. BLUFF takes a look at the unknown, stretching the possibilities and challenging us to rethink what we know.
With recent reports that the suicide rate in this country is at an all time high, we have to ask ourselves why and subsequently open the door to a public discourse about a topic that continues to be taboo. Those who suffer from mental illness and severe depression often find suicide their only option. They need to have a voice in this discussion.  
The overarching theme of this play is a look at acceptance. Through the eyes of the characters, BLUFF explores the damaging effects of judgment and petty differences that only prevent us from honoring each other and respecting each other's choices. 
How we live our lives individually and collectively is a daily decision we all make. Whether this is an active or passive choice is up to us. But lying on our deathbeds may not be the best time or place to first evaluate that.     Win, Win  There is no downside to investing in this play. Or the arts. Ever. PLEASE know that your investment allows you:  Accessibility. You're singlehandedly bringing new theatre to an Off Broadway stage. This is nothing to sneeze at. And you're doing it for far less than if you were an investor in a professional production with a normal run.  A very unique investment. When can you actually see your hard-earned dollars play the role of hard-earned dollars for someone else? That's right! You're actually paying salaries with your investment and directly supporting actors in exhibiting their craft.
Far-reaching support. This just doesn't impact one theatre and one play. It affects the larger theatre industry as a whole in New York City, which in turn, impacts the rest of the country. As small theaters thrive in the Big Apple, new plays get a chance to be aired, and eventually, made available to theaters everywhere. Most of the powerful and important plays that you see today in your community theaters or even high schools were developed in Off Broadway venues.
You're more than just a number. But numbers do indeed matter. We need to show future Broadway producers we can attract investors. And the more people who show their support by donating--even at the minimum level--the better the show looks as an investment vehicle.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span><i>Death for Five Voices</i>  is an original musical drama that explores the 
complex artistic personage of Prince Carlo Gesualdo, a groundbreaking composer 
of the late Renaissance.  The story is based on a historic event:  On October 16, 1590<br/>
Carlo entrapped and brutally murdered his wife, Maria 
D’Avalos, and her lover, Fabrizio Carafa, at the Gesualdo home, the 
Palazzo San Severo in Naples.  At the time, the murders were widely known and documented,  
but nothing was done to apprehend Carlo who, as an Italian nobleman, and
 having caught the lovers <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, was within his rights.</span></p>This new work investigates how the composer's creative internal life
 and subsequent compositions may have been related to his brutal 
external actions.  Peter Mills' sophisticated score, which 
incorporates musical themes from Gesualdo's compositions, blends period 
musical style with contemporary theater storytelling to create a 
compelling portrait of a troubled artist, living at a moment in history 
when complex political and religious forces collided and changed our 
perceptions of the possibility of art.  
<br/><br/>A
 cast of seven actor-singers and a chamber ensemble of four musicians will 
bring to life this gripping drama and psychologically thrilling tale of 
the voices that lived within Carlo Gesualdo.<br/>   
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this project, we are specifically in need of support to assure we 
can accomplish the musical aspects of this production, in keeping with Gesualdo's legacy as an outstanding musician and composer.  Funds we 
raise through this campaign will be used to assure the best possible aural experience for both 
Gesualdo's and Peter Mills' music.  We've already raised funds for this production, including receiving a special design grant which will support scenic, costume and lighting needs.  However, we still are 
seeking critical funds to meet our production budget, and help the show 
realize its potential.   </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $15,000 through this campaign, to cover expenses related to the music and sound design for this production, including renting a piano and sound equipment, and hiring personnel including musicians and technicians.<br/>

<br/><h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<div>We are 60 Grit Theatre Company, a young experimental cohort of theatre makers exploring the darkest corners of human experience.  We strive to push the boundaries of traditional theatre by fearlessly dissecting what it means to be human.  60 Grit's inaugural production, Adam Rapp's Blackbird (a gritty tale  of addiction), opened in London March 2016 to 4 star reviews.  Now, we need your help to bring Sarah Kane's brutal and beautiful <i>B L A S T E D  </i>to the Portland Stage Studio Theatre.  The story is a technically ambitious production and we can not do Kane justice without your help.</div>
<div><h3>About the Show: </h3></div>
<div>
<b> Confined Spaces.  War.  Complacent bystanders.  Tabloid Journalists.  These are just a few components of B L A S T E D. </b>  </div>
<div>20 years ago, Sarah Kane’s début play set the modern theatre on its ear: her work was championed by some and condemned by others for its violence and fearless presentation of the darkest facets of human nature.  This haunting, and eerily prescient play has lost none of its ability to stir and move us.  Many said that <i>B L A S T E D</i> overplayed the scenario of violence and was quickly  branded  a ""... disgusting feast of filth."" by the Daily Mail.   60 Grit Theatre Company intends to prove that Kane's story is more than senseless brutality.   Underneath lies a powerful exploration of human experience fiercely relevant to modern politics.   Kane shines a light on complacency, proving culture is wrong to assume distant wars have nothing to do with us and we are safe. </div>
<div>
<i> B L A S T E D </i> tackles extreme themes of sexual and physical violence and we do not take our responsibility lightly.   60 Grit will collaborate with the community and local trauma organizations to hold vital post-show discussions regarding trauma, specifically PTS related.  We hope to use this production to actively engage the community in important healing, awareness, and discussion.  Your donation will reach far beyond this production, allowing us resources to further engage the community and partner with vital trauma centres.    </div>

<p>What is KWP Productions?</p>
<p>KWP productions was formed to inspire the next generation of
performers and theatre goers. We are dedicated to providing performance and training
opportunities for actors young and old alike. We provide the community with
high quality theatrical programming for all ages. </p>
<p>Our Story:</p>
<p>KWP Productions was created 5 years ago at the request of a
local theatre that wanted to provide family oriented programming. After a 4
year collaboration with the theater their programming goals changed and we
found ourselves, at the last minute, without a facility in which to produce our
plays and musicals. Subsequently we thought we arranged for another facility
only to unexpectantly lose that space as well. There are very few appropriate
performance venues in the northern end of Palm Beach County. As a result, the
next year we rented a local high school theatre. Finding that this was not a
good fit we realized that the best way to serve the community and continue our programming
was to find our own space that we could use to produce our own plays as well as
host events and programming for other groups who struggle with the gypsy life
as we do.</p>
<p>Our current small studio (1100 square feet) is inadequate to really meet our needs and allow us to grow. Being
nomads for performances is difficult. </p>
<p>We have found a place to call our own (4500 square feet!), a place where we can
create our own theatre and share that space with a myriad of other
organizations struggling as we are to find a cost effective and intimate performance
space. In addition the venue would be available to private individuals for
events. </p>
<p>We are entering our 6<sup>th</sup> season!! This is an
exciting time for us. Your support will allow us to expand programming, build
audience, keep producing high quality productions, provide a venue for others
in need of a performance space and keep a roof over our heads! We are planning
to produce numerous shows on our black box stage next year (2016-2017 Season).

<p><b>What is Geekenders?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><br/>
Geekenders is a semi-professional theatre and event troupe with the simple goal of expanding the demographic that musical theatre, vaudeville, and burlesque appeals to, and to provide fun and safe venues for all people, nerdy or not, to mingle in. We do shows based on things that geeks (that’s us!) love, and are one of the only non-union theatre groups in Canada that regularly pays its actors. <br/>
<br/>
We are feminist, queer-positive, and body-positive.<br/>

<p><b>What is Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical?</b><br/>
<br/>
Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical was the first all-ages show Geekenders ever put on. We were just doing it for fun, because we love the video game, and hoped some of our fanbase from our burlesque shows would come and see it.<br/>
<br/>
Reddit, tumblr, and the internet at large got ahold of the show and the world exploded for us! Now, we want to put on a bigger, better production of the show that changed all of our lives. <br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466444304/13446154_10153948772258001_2095055814_o_oxgjdv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Costume design concept art by Shayan Naziripour. Prints available in the perks list!</span></p>
The musical itself takes familiar songs from the musical theatre canon and parodies them to reflect the world of Aperture Science and one test subject’s journey from a stasis chamber to the surface of the earth. Combining stage magic with two parallel stories of betrayal, love, and science, Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical tells the story of the second game in the Portal franchise with humour, heart, and tremendous chutzpah from a dedicated group of fans. While the show is a parody (as we turn the genre of musical comedy on its head and parody theatre tropes and classic tunes), the piece also treats the source material as the serious, beloved property it is. The resulting show is fast-paced, wacky, nerdy, and so much fun.
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>17,000 dollars pays for the production of the show at its barest minimum. It includes paying a stage manager and lighting designer and operator, and the cast, crew, and larger band with honourariums. It includes a budget for all-new costumes, as the ones from the original show have scattered to the winds and we wish to design something a little more magical. It includes a budget for publicity and a new, more immersive set. Additionally, it will cover new props; we didn’t plan to do the show again, and the original Portal guns were signed and presented to children who attended our original show. It also covers our rehearsal space and microphone rental, as well as paying a tech person for running those mics.<br/><br/></p>

Prints available in the perks list!</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Having already established critical and commercial success in Vancouver, Canada, Geekenders Theatricals' Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical will be going on to set the standard for independent Vancouver theatre. As one of Canada’s only ‘amateur’ companies paying its actors, Geekenders Theatricals is ready to strip away the precedents of what it means to be doing theatre on an ""indie"" level. Geekenders Theatricals shows have established a reputation for good humour, warmth, and inclusiveness, and now wan to add the highest production values to that reputation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>EMPOWERMENT. Geekenders is proudly people-positive, casting artists based on passion and talent rather than weight, gender identity, appearance, LGBT-identity, or any other aspect of their self.<br/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466444478/13446090_10153948772193001_1823631665_o_iyscl6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Costume design concept art by Shayan Naziripour. Prints available in the perks list!</span></p><p></p>
Further, Geekenders practices a mentorship program, wherein in any given show, a passionate individual with either no stage experience or no specific experience with the genre of theatre we’re producing at the time, will be cast and mentored by the entire team. Donation to this crowndfund will help make an individual cast member’s dream of performing come true.<br/>
<br/>
Further, The story of Portal 2 is, in some aspects, a cautionary tale about the powers of emotional abuse and romantic predators. These themes are explored in a frank way that is safe for all ages, but doesn’t shy away from the horrors that many men and women go through in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
‘Portal 2: The Unauthorized Musical’ is a show with many layers, safe for children, with a message that adults can relate to on a different level.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466443338/13467603_10153956469338001_724718595_o_ti1tke.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Personality core clips -- available as an indiegogo-exclusive perk!</p>
We believe that Geekenders’ message of acceptance is timely, but the mission of Geekenders is an important one as well. Geekenders puts on shows and events with specific pop culture themes so as to encourage audience members who have never experienced theatre before, to give it a try. 
<p>
</p>
<p>Performed this January 2017 at Vancouver’s historic Rio Theatre, ‘Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical’ will be reaching 1500+ audience members of various ages, ethnicities, and gender identities - everyone is welcome at Geekenders shows. And that only describes the live audience. On youtube, Geekenders has over 500,000 total views, with the original production of ‘Portal 2: the (Unauthorized) Musical’ reaching over 150,000 people.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We will be mounting this production whether we reach our fundraising goals or not, but as we pay for show expenses out of pocket, always, it’s hard for us to do anything but live from show to show. This crowdfunding experience will help us to create a nest egg with which we can pay for future shows without as much risk. <br/><br/></p>

Combining high-octane choreography by established dancer/choreographer Patrice Bowler and stunning direction by Fairlith Harvey and Andrew Lynch, ‘Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical’ presents a first-rate adaptation of a beloved video game in an effort to discuss topics of feminism, abusive relationships, PTSD, and body positivity.Teaser trailer for the original production:
What is Geekenders?
Geekenders is a semi-professional theatre and event troupe with the simple goal of expanding the demographic that musical theatre, vaudeville, and burlesque appeals to, and to provide fun and safe venues for all people, nerdy or not, to mingle in. We do shows based on things that geeks (that’s us!) love, and are one of the only non-union theatre groups in Canada that regularly pays its actors. 

We are feminist, queer-positive, and body-positive.

Past shows we’ve done include Jurassic Parody: The Musical!, a pantomime-style show for all ages, Vegas-style spectacular takes on the Star Wars universe, and an interactive Batman-themed dinner event in a spectacular mansion on Halloween.

What is Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical?

Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical was the first all-ages show Geekenders ever put on. We were just doing it for fun, because we love the video game, and hoped some of our fanbase from our burlesque shows would come and see it.

Reddit, tumblr, and the internet at large got ahold of the show and the world exploded for us! Now, we want to put on a bigger, better production of the show that changed all of our lives.

The musical itself takes familiar songs from the musical theatre canon and parodies them to reflect the world of Aperture Science and one test subject’s journey from a stasis chamber to the surface of the earth. Combining stage magic with two parallel stories of betrayal, love, and science, Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical tells the story of the second game in the Portal franchise with humour, heart, and tremendous chutzpah from a dedicated group of fans. While the show is a parody (as we turn the genre of musical comedy on its head and parody theatre tropes and classic tunes), the piece also treats the source material as the serious, beloved property it is. The resulting show is fast-paced, wacky, nerdy, and so much fun.

   What We Need & What You Get 
17,000 dollars pays for the production of the show at its barest minimum. It includes paying a stage manager and lighting designer and operator, and the cast, crew, and larger band with honourariums. It includes a budget for all-new costumes, as the ones from the original show have scattered to the winds and we wish to design something a little more magical. It includes a budget for publicity and a new, more immersive set. Additionally, it will cover new props; we didn’t plan to do the show again, and the original Portal guns were signed and presented to children who attended our original show. It also covers our rehearsal space and microphone rental, as well as paying a tech person for running those mics.

Having already established critical and commercial success in Vancouver, Canada, Geekenders Theatricals' Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical will be going on to set the standard for independent Vancouver theatre. As one of Canada’s only ‘amateur’ companies paying its actors, Geekenders Theatricals is ready to strip away the precedents of what it means to be doing theatre on an ""indie"" level. Geekenders Theatricals shows have established a reputation for good humour, warmth, and inclusiveness, and now wan to add the highest production values to that reputation.


EMPOWERMENT. Geekenders is proudly people-positive, casting artists based on passion and talent rather than weight, gender identity, appearance, LGBT-identity, or any other aspect of their self.

Further, Geekenders practices a mentorship program, wherein in any given show, a passionate individual with either no stage experience or no specific experience with the genre of theatre we’re producing at the time, will be cast and mentored by the entire team. Donation to this crowndfund will help make an individual cast member’s dream of performing come true.

Further, The story of Portal 2 is, in some aspects, a cautionary tale about the powers of emotional abuse and romantic predators. These themes are explored in a frank way that is safe for all ages, but doesn’t shy away from the horrors that many men and women go through in their lives.

‘Portal 2: The Unauthorized Musical’ is a show with many layers, safe for children, with a message that adults can relate to on a different level.Personality core clips -- available as an indiegogo-exclusive perk!
We believe that Geekenders’ message of acceptance is timely, but the mission of Geekenders is an important one as well. Geekenders puts on shows and events with specific pop culture themes so as to encourage audience members who have never experienced theatre before, to give it a try. 


Performed this January 2017 at Vancouver’s historic Rio Theatre, ‘Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical’ will be reaching 1500+ audience members of various ages, ethnicities, and gender identities - everyone is welcome at Geekenders shows. And that only describes the live audience. On youtube, Geekenders has over 500,000 total views, with the original production of ‘Portal 2: the (Unauthorized) Musical’ reaching over 150,000 people.   Risks & Challenges  
We will be mounting this production whether we reach our fundraising goals or not, but as we pay for show expenses out of pocket, always, it’s hard for us to do anything but live from show to show. This crowdfunding experience will help us to create a nest egg with which we can pay for future shows without as much risk.

With the show's established financial viability, secured run this January in Vancouver, and established partnership with the Rio, ‘Portal 2: The (Unauthorized) Musical has already set the stage for Vancouver’s most exciting show this winter!

We believe we can learn anything, and we can help you learn it to.    We want our festival to grow along with its team and so we decided to ask everyone for help.We would be pleased with any help that you can give, maybe a share, a facebook like, or a kind word, is all you have to give right now, and we really appreciate it. Thank you,OKaua Theatre Company.  Website: http://festivalulokaua.ro/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FestivaluldeTeatruOKaua_____________________________________________________ Festivalul de Teatru OKaua este cea mai mare realizare a Companiei noastre  În spatele acestui succes, se ascund 12 ani de muncă grea și eforturile enorme ale fiecăruia dintre membrii care au sperat că într-o zi ar putea crea un ""loc de joacă"" de care iubitorii de teatru ,și iubitorii de artă în general, ar putea beneficia. Prima ediție, în 2012, a fost baza solidă de care aveam nevoie pentru a construi o competiție puternică, natională și chiar internatională în următorii ani.  Scopul nostru este chiar deviza care definește trupa noastră: ""Educația prin teatru""În țările occidentale, această formă de educație este implementată în curriculumul școlar, în timp ce în România se produce numai datorită ambiției unor oameni cu adevărat devotați artei.Începând cu cea de-a doua ediție, a fost introdusă o nouă secțiune, alături de secțiunea ""Liceeni"": ""Studenți"", unde spectacolele realizate de UNATC (  Universitatea Națională de Teatru și Cinematografie ""I.L. Caragiale"" ,București) și Universitatea Hyperion au încântat publicul și UNARTE ( Universitatea Națională de Arte, București) și-a prezentat machetele de decor și măștile de teatru. Astăzi vrem să facem încă un pas și să schimbăm statutul festivalului în ""internațional"", dar acesta este doar un vis, și de aceea avem nevoie de ajutorul tău.Știm că orice ajutor mic poate face diferența dintre vis si realitate și dorim să vă oferim șansa de a face acest lucru. Cine suntem? Numele trupei noastre, ""OKaua"", arată crezul nostru de a măsura totul folosind o scară unică, scara VALORII REALE ȘI A COMPETIȚIEI. ""Ocaua"" este în limba română o unitate de măsură din secolul al XIX-lea.        Acest crez, inspirat de lucrările lui William Shakespeare, a dat naștere motto-ului festivalului:""Măsură pentru măsură""Suntem singura trupă de liceu din România invitată să participe la festivaluri profesioniste, inclusiv la Festivalul Internațional ""Shakespeare"", pentru trei ediții la rând, deci știm cât de important este pentru un festival să invite atât profesioniști cât și amatori profesionalizați.Stadiul actual al festivalului  Perioada: 10 - 12 mai 2017Locația: Palatul Național al Copiilor - Sala Ion CojarStructura: Două secțiuni competiționale:- Liceeni (pe lângă spectacolul din concurs, va exista și un ""Scenariu impus"")- Studenți (pe lângă spectacolul din concurs, va exista o probă de improvizație)- Momente de dans și teatru prezentate in afara concursului- Workshop-uri- Creații plastice (Costume și Măști de Teatru și Machete de Decor – Secțiune rezervată studenților la scenografie și la arte plastice).Juriul :  actori, profesori U.N.A.T.C. și din domeniul pedagogiei teatrale, oameni de radio și televiziune, cântăreți.Trofeul festivalului poate fi câștigat atât de o trupă de liceeni cât și de o trupă de studenți.  De ce și cum poți să ne ajuți?    Festivalul nostru dorește să devină internațional și să adauge și mai multe forme de artă la viitoarele ediții, cum ar fi: teatru-dans, teatru de animație, teatru-sport, pantomima sau musicalul.Ne autofinanțam prin contribuția fiecărui membru și astfel am finanțat cea mai mare parte a festivalului nostru, foarte mulți oameni/sponsori mici s-au alăturat cauzei noastre, dar nu sunt suficienți pentru ceea ce vrem să construim.Vindem obiecte handmade încă de acum 4 ani pentru a putea plăti pentru o parte din ultimele ediții ale acestui eveniment. Am avut, de asemenea, spectacole, jucate special pentru strângerea de fonduri pentru acest festival, am făcut voluntariate ca să promovăm festivalul nostru și am câștigat câteva premii în bani de-a lungul timpului cu spectacolele trupei noastre.   Avem nevoie de această strângere de fonduri pentru a plăti pentru:- transportul, mâncarea și cazarea pentru fiecare trupă internațională sau națională care ar dori să se alăture nouă și tuturor celor care doresc să vadă spectacolele, dar care nu au mijloace să o facă- anunțuri si reclame care pot promova festivalul nostru și ne pot aduce mai multă publicitate- plata pentru juriul nostru prestigios- mâncarea pe care o oferim la eveniment- toate materialele promoționale, cum ar fi roll-up-uri, autocolante și postere.Știm cum să facem față obstacolelor pentru că am pornit de la nimic. Am învățat cum să lucrăm cu oamenii, cum să ne promovăm ideile, cum să construim lucruri cu mâinile noastre, cum să facem materiale promoționale și cel mai important : cum să construim ceva de la zero. Credem că putem învăța orice și ca vă putem ajuta si pe voi să învățați.     Vrem ca festivalul nostru să crească odată cu echipa sa și astfel ne-am decis să cerem ajutor tuturor. Ne bucurăm de orice ajutor pe care îl puteți oferi, poate că un share, un like pe facebook sau un cuvânt bun este tot ce aveți să oferiți acum și îl apreciăm cu adevărat.  Mulțumim,Compania de Teatru OKaua.  Website: http://festivalulokaua.ro/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FestivaluldeTeatruOKaua",10.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>BEAVER by Claudia Dey: a CO-PRO BETWEEN WeWillMeet Productions and The Storefront Theater #indieunite</h3>
<p>I'm Chala Hunter, Artistic Director of WeWillMeet Productions. I am an actor, writer, and producer living in Toronto, ON, and I'm originally from Saskatoon, SK. I studied as an actor at The Univserity of Toronto, and The National Theatre School of Canada, and have been working as a professional actor, as well as producing and making my own work for ten years. I have a profound to see my ethic, politics and aesthetics upheld and fostered in the cultural ecology of this country.  This includes a devotion to female driven content, where the protagonists are women, and the stories foster a perspective other than the male gaze. I'm equally motivated to invest belief, time, and money into a Canadian aesthetic that reflects the landscape and people of this country, and their interactions and experiences, which includes people of all cultural backgrounds, including the first keepers of this land. I want to support, produce, and foster Canadian talent so that people are compelled to stay in this country.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My campaign is towards the full production of Beaver, a classical Canadiana story, with a renegade female hero.  In order to mount this show, and to do justice to the rich script and complex vision in a way that is inventive, highly stylized and bold I needed to hire designers and actors of the highest skill level. I have an enormous vision for this play, which is ultimately Claudia's vision, which she articulates with humour, love, poetry and intense specificity and skill in her text, capturing family relationships and the struggle to find one's way in the world in a way that everyone can relate to.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The same way a bank, or a new condo, or any new product needs investment to get it off the ground, this team and this story needs people who are passionate about making female driven stories a priority in our culture to help get this play off it's feet. Any contribution you make will go towards compensating these artists who are coming together from diverse communities and backgrounds to make this coming of age story for girls come to life.  </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Because of the turn around time between programming and production is under six months, the</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> opportunities to apply for government</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> funding are</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">  very limited. This show will sell out, and the box office sales will cover our basic production costs, including rehearsal space and rentals.</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> The Storefront endeavours to make theatre tickets accessible and affordable, and that means an incredible diversity of audiences members are able to, and DO walk through it's doors. But it also means</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> this large team of primarily</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> women needs outside support in order to make this project sustainable for these incredibly devoted and talented artists. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?</h3>
<p>Your contributions will allow the team to cover some production costs and contribute to the compensation of the performers, who will be working fast and hard over three weeks. </p>
<p>We will be transforming The Storefront Theatre with a design that will make the space nearly unrecognizable.  We are interested in pushing forward a growing desire for an inventive and modern aesthetic in the theatre culture of Toronto, that moves outside of traditional forms of narrative realism, alongside our European and American counterparts, who are WELL ahead of us in this regard. We need so much paint to do this. So much.</p>
<p>Our lightning designer, Kaileigh Krysztofiak is coming from The Stratford Festival to work on Beaver, and because The Storefront has a limited lighting set up, we will need to rent external light fixtures in order to uphold her incredible vision for the lights, which play such an important part of Claudia's highly aesthetic play, in which light and sound are described in articulate and precise detail. </p>
<p>Rehearsal space, rights to the brilliant play (writers need to get paid also), and a membership to TAPA (Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts) so that we can be included in the official Dora Jury Nomination selection are addition production costs that will allow this story of a young woman struggling, and ultimately succeeding, to overcome family trauma, inhabit her own life, and personal power, to be produced with the level professionalism it deserves.</p>
<p>After all our production costs are met, all remaining funds will be divided equally according to The Equity Artist's Collective Policy, among all artistic members of the team, which includes the director, stage manager (invaluable!), designers, and the actors.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>BENEFITS/PERKS</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY DOES THIS PLAY MATTER IN THE GRAND SCHEME?</h3>
<p>Joseph Campbell, mythologist and writer of “The Hero With a Thousand Faces”, says we need stories to exist so that we can feel their relevance to what is happening in our own lives. So what happens if you grow up, mature, and continue to exist still being show primarily male hero myths?  Certainly much of the theatre STILL being produced in this country (and the world) depict female experiences of being alive as constructed by men. If we tell these stories again and again, no matter how we frame and re frame them, they still largely feature women who are demonized for their desires, or punished for ambition, anger, strength--characteristics celebrated in the men inside these same stories. This is part of what makes Beaver, a story that delves into the lives of five women struggling to “fly their own flag”, so special and essential at this time in our cultural ecology, as Canadians. The opportunity to make a difference in the way we allow women to think about their lives is at our fingertips, and as an artist who contributes to culture I feel this responsibly acutely.</p>
<p>Language is a site of cultural and political struggle. So then what are the cultural and political ramifications of continually putting up plays, or creating content that reinforces gender roles and replays (literally re-plays) traumatic or oppressive situations and circumstances? What does is mean that the word HERO is still associated with maleness?

</div></div>","BEAVER by Claudia Dey: a CO-PRO BETWEEN WeWillMeet Productions and The Storefront Theater #indieunite
I'm Chala Hunter, Artistic Director of WeWillMeet Productions. I am an actor, writer, and producer living in Toronto, ON, and I'm originally from Saskatoon, SK. I studied as an actor at The Univserity of Toronto, and The National Theatre School of Canada, and have been working as a professional actor, as well as producing and making my own work for ten years. I have a profound to see my ethic, politics and aesthetics upheld and fostered in the cultural ecology of this country.  This includes a devotion to female driven content, where the protagonists are women, and the stories foster a perspective other than the male gaze. I'm equally motivated to invest belief, time, and money into a Canadian aesthetic that reflects the landscape and people of this country, and their interactions and experiences, which includes people of all cultural backgrounds, including the first keepers of this land. I want to support, produce, and foster Canadian talent so that people are compelled to stay in this country.
WHAT IS THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT?
My campaign is towards the full production of Beaver, a classical Canadiana story, with a renegade female hero.  In order to mount this show, and to do justice to the rich script and complex vision in a way that is inventive, highly stylized and bold I needed to hire designers and actors of the highest skill level. I have an enormous vision for this play, which is ultimately Claudia's vision, which she articulates with humour, love, poetry and intense specificity and skill in her text, capturing family relationships and the struggle to find one's way in the world in a way that everyone can relate to.
The same way a bank, or a new condo, or any new product needs investment to get it off the ground, this team and this story needs people who are passionate about making female driven stories a priority in our culture to help get this play off it's feet. Any contribution you make will go towards compensating these artists who are coming together from diverse communities and backgrounds to make this coming of age story for girls come to life.  Because of the turn around time between programming and production is under six months, the opportunities to apply for government funding are  very limited. This show will sell out, and the box office sales will cover our basic production costs, including rehearsal space and rentals. The Storefront endeavours to make theatre tickets accessible and affordable, and that means an incredible diversity of audiences members are able to, and DO walk through it's doors. But it also means this large team of primarily women needs outside support in order to make this project sustainable for these incredibly devoted and talented artists. 

WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?
Your contributions will allow the team to cover some production costs and contribute to the compensation of the performers, who will be working fast and hard over three weeks. 
We will be transforming The Storefront Theatre with a design that will make the space nearly unrecognizable.  We are interested in pushing forward a growing desire for an inventive and modern aesthetic in the theatre culture of Toronto, that moves outside of traditional forms of narrative realism, alongside our European and American counterparts, who are WELL ahead of us in this regard. We need so much paint to do this. So much.
Our lightning designer, Kaileigh Krysztofiak is coming from The Stratford Festival to work on Beaver, and because The Storefront has a limited lighting set up, we will need to rent external light fixtures in order to uphold her incredible vision for the lights, which play such an important part of Claudia's highly aesthetic play, in which light and sound are described in articulate and precise detail. 
Rehearsal space, rights to the brilliant play (writers need to get paid also), and a membership to TAPA (Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts) so that we can be included in the official Dora Jury Nomination selection are addition production costs that will allow this story of a young woman struggling, and ultimately succeeding, to overcome family trauma, inhabit her own life, and personal power, to be produced with the level professionalism it deserves.
After all our production costs are met, all remaining funds will be divided equally according to The Equity Artist's Collective Policy, among all artistic members of the team, which includes the director, stage manager (invaluable!), designers, and the actors.
 
BENEFITS/PERKS
 
WHY DOES THIS PLAY MATTER IN THE GRAND SCHEME?
Joseph Campbell, mythologist and writer of “The Hero With a Thousand Faces”, says we need stories to exist so that we can feel their relevance to what is happening in our own lives. So what happens if you grow up, mature, and continue to exist still being show primarily male hero myths?  Certainly much of the theatre STILL being produced in this country (and the world) depict female experiences of being alive as constructed by men. If we tell these stories again and again, no matter how we frame and re frame them, they still largely feature women who are demonized for their desires, or punished for ambition, anger, strength--characteristics celebrated in the men inside these same stories. This is part of what makes Beaver, a story that delves into the lives of five women struggling to “fly their own flag”, so special and essential at this time in our cultural ecology, as Canadians. The opportunity to make a difference in the way we allow women to think about their lives is at our fingertips, and as an artist who contributes to culture I feel this responsibly acutely.
Language is a site of cultural and political struggle. So then what are the cultural and political ramifications of continually putting up plays, or creating content that reinforces gender roles and replays (literally re-plays) traumatic or oppressive situations and circumstances? What does is mean that the word HERO is still associated with maleness? It’s easy to just throw around phrases like “girl power” and “strong woman” (as if the word ‘woman’ doesn’t already include strong in its meaning) but what we really need to work on is getting active about understanding that a female hero myth is just a hero myth, with a female hero. 
WeWillMeet Productions has a history of producing feminist theatre experiences, (Five Fingers, Amy: La Reine des Morts, and Fresh Water) and I have cultivated an acting and producing career were every project I take on integrates my social and political values, I am constantly investigating how I can question the gendered implications within every role I play, because I know that what I put out there, will affect younger women watching me. When I first read Beaver, and discovered Claudia's writing, which is both poetic, playful, funny, and bitterly honest, I felt as though someone had finally given my spirit water to drink. The sense of feeling represented and recognized, of being reflected back to myself was life changing, literally.  All the women who have read this play, including the ones who are going to work on it, are captured and captivated by the play, it has a kind of resonance for women of all ages and backgrounds. If the purpose of art isn't to awaken people's heart's in this way, so they can feel seen, less alone, and more alive, then I don't know what it is.

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE:</strong></p>
<p>Third Eye Theatre Ensemble presents quality productions that inspire conversation. We want to get people talking about the issues we face in today's world and hope the power of music and theater can inspire those conversations at a community level.

Last year, we gathered a wonderful team of director and actors and workshopped the play through a resolutely physical approach. As we entered the complex world of the play's characters, we were amazed by the layers and the colors intertwined in the play, both in terms of character relationships and in terms of political resonance. </p><p>This past September, we have been invited by La MaMa Theater to present the play in a coproduction. We are so grateful to La MaMa for their invitation and we are very much looking forward to presenting this timely play in their theater.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Why you are so important</h3><p>As we are entering the rehearsal phase, <strong>we are now reaching out to YOU</strong>.</p><p>We are looking for your support to make our production as exciting as it can be.</p><p>We are looking to raise<strong> $10,000 </strong>in order to finance part of our <strong>production costs, including set, costumes, props, promotion material, designers and PR. </strong></p><p>By helping us now, you will not only help us reach the full potential of this production,  but you will also participate in making our artistic choices most meaningful.</p><p>The first $5,000 will cover our basic production budget.

In this case, the only refuge becomes fantasy where boundaries are blurred and taboos lifted. Here, savage love erupts and finds no other exit than self destruction. </p><p>An unequivocal literary work, Genet’s play captures the grim substance of the incestuous relationship of the Papin sisters while sending us to a flower-coated fantasy dream. Role games and class war add a singularly timely dimension to this classic, in a time of stark political and economic divide.</p><h3>About the Artists</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480357596/ts1aijeo8a2wjshptizh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Oliver Henzler</strong> (Director) is a New York based theater maker and performer.

Last year, we gathered a wonderful team of director and actors and workshopped the play through a resolutely physical approach. As we entered the complex world of the play's characters, we were amazed by the layers and the colors intertwined in the play, both in terms of character relationships and in terms of political resonance. This past September, we have been invited by La MaMa Theater to present the play in a coproduction. We are so grateful to La MaMa for their invitation and we are very much looking forward to presenting this timely play in their theater. Why you are so importantAs we are entering the rehearsal phase, we are now reaching out to YOU.We are looking for your support to make our production as exciting as it can be.We are looking to raise $10,000 in order to finance part of our production costs, including set, costumes, props, promotion material, designers and PR.

We thank you for your help and look forward to seeing you in the theater. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP & SUPPORT About the MaidsAn aborted revolution, Les Bonnes (the Maids) stages the pathetic failure to break from social domination when the engine that drives the revolt is an unescapable identification to the very power that is the source of oppression. In this case, the only refuge becomes fantasy where boundaries are blurred and taboos lifted. Here, savage love erupts and finds no other exit than self destruction. An unequivocal literary work, Genet’s play captures the grim substance of the incestuous relationship of the Papin sisters while sending us to a flower-coated fantasy dream. Role games and class war add a singularly timely dimension to this classic, in a time of stark political and economic divide.About the ArtistsOliver Henzler (Director) is a New York based theater maker and performer.

<h3>Who we are!</h3>
<p>Cirquedelic is a bay area circus crew that produces events, as well as provides incredible atmosphere and performance. Alongside SpekrFreks, Wood St Productions, and Inked Sherbert we have created a spectacle of a show. Not only are we looking forward to performing it in Oakland this March, but we also plan to take it on the road. The album has been funded and created but we still have costumes, sets, props, hours of projection mapping, and so much more to create. Which is why where you come in!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>So why do we need $13,000? Well to start we need to design and create 12 beautiful costumes that are both pleasing to look at, and functional to the circus performer. On top of that our Dr. has turned our performers into mechanical marvels, which are all props that need to be built and again usable to the performers wearing them. Factor in makeup, and additional performance props and that alone gets expensive quick. Then we need to build multiple sets that are also transportable for tour. From there we will be spending hours upon hours mapping the sets, as well as the performers for a spectacular visual fusion of performer and projections. We honestly have not budgeted what the crew deserves hourly both performance and production sides, but we are trying to compensate a little of that. Not to mention our incredible artist who as I mentioned has designed the entire look and feel of the show, and will be creating a comic book based on our show. Everything you give will go into making this a mindblowing show, and directly to all the artists involved. For your donations we've got lots of rewards from tickets, to the comic book, lessons from the performers, or even us throwing you a big ole circus party!! Any and all help is greatly appreciated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why this show is important to us.</h3>
<p>For the last 5 years Cirquedelic has created visceral experiences all over the Bay are. Including the wildly popular, Freaky Deeky circus party monthly. We labor daily to not only perfect our art, but imagine new and beautiful experiences for our audiences. This is something, to my knowledge, that has not been done. Taking the best in electronic music, combining it with musical theater, then adding circus performance, and state of the art projection mapping. We are pulling so many elements from the festival, and big event scenes and bringing it to a whole new group in, in a very unique way. Our hope is to immerse you into this unique reality somewhere between history, comic book, and party... all while giving you all manner of spectacle to sit back and enjoy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Tough Stuff</h3>
<p>So obviously breaking new ground is scary and completely without assurance. Mixing a musical and glitch-hop alone is something many people have questioned. Throw in also creating a new aesthetic we're calling steameasy (a merging of steampunk and speakeasy fashion), and then attempting to tell a theatrical story with circus performers... we have a lot of curiosity, but also some doubt. This is a huge undertaking, and I at times have questioned my own sanity... but the second we got the first track and my dream had a soundtrack... I knew. So did an investor who heard it and immediately offered to cover our music production costs. I know the incredible level of talent I've brought together is going to produce an experience unlike any other, which is a staggering feat in the bay.</p>

<h3>What is <i>The Cadaver Synod: A Pope Musical?</i>
</h3>
<p>There are some moments in history that make you think... huh?  This is one of those moments.  And it's a musical now.</p>
<p>In the year 897 AD, Pope Stephen VII dug up the corpse of his predecessor, Pope Formosus, and put the rotting body on trial in front of the entire Roman clergy, senate, and aristocracy.  Literally dressed it up in its old Pope clothes, propped it up on a chair, and screamed accusations at the thing for hours while a whole host of onlookers nodded along.  The only person assigned to defend the dead body was a teenage deacon, a sputtering, naive academic facing a righteous onslaught from the most holy and famous man on Earth.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Stephen had the corpse declared guilty of... crimes, and the body was dismembered, disrobed, and thrown in the Tiber River.  If you think this is a spoiler, we assure you: there is so much more to it.</p>
<p>Why did Stephen do this?  What could drive a man to execute a cadaver posthumously?  And why, by all accounts, was he SO.  VERY.  ANGRY?  These are the questions this musical seeks to answer.  And our conclusions may not be what you expect.</p>
<p>After coming across this story in 2014, amateur bull rider and noted physicist Robbie Florian had visions of rock'n'roll popes, undulating bishops, and tap-dancing corpses dancing through his head (much akin to sugarplums 'round Christmastime).  He has spent three years writing the book, music, and lyrics for the show, and now it is receiving its WORLD PREMIERE with the New York Musical Festival, headed by our brilliant director RYAN EMMONS (Groundhog Day, Matilda, Ghost) and our outstanding music director DAN GARMON (The Bad Years, The Other Side of Paradise, dangarmon.com).  Together, they are creating a show unlike any other, combining a plethora of theatrical and musical genres into one ambitious, explosive happening.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to a goal of $45,000 to help us make this production as spectacular and mind-blowing as possible.  Your money will go toward:</p>
<p>A cast of 13 INCREDIBLE ACTORS (soon to be announced)</p>
<p>COSTUMES to prevent them from being naked</p>
<p>MICROPHONES so we can hear them speak, sing, and ululate</p>
<p>PROPS that they can manipulate with their limbs</p>
<p>A GNARLY POPE CORPSE to make various hairs stand on end</p>
<p>A 5-PIECE BAND including drums, guitar, bass, piano, and brass to shake the theatre with the power of papal punk, pop, doo-wop, and ska (among others)</p>
<p>A SET to transport you to the beat-down Rome of the 9th century</p>
<p>REHEARSAL SPACE, PUBLICITY, INSURANCE, RUNNING CREW, PHOTOGRAPHY...</p>
<p>AND MUCH MORE!</p>
<p>Your money will go a long way.  For example, a donation of $50 dollars pays for ALL OF OUR SCRIPTS.  A donation of $200 CLOTHES AN ENTIRE ACTOR head to toe.  $500 pays for the very crux of our show: THE POPE CORPSE.  $2,000 covers THE WHOLE SET.  $3,000 - THE WHOLE BAND.  $5,000 would mean our entire REHEARSAL PROCESS would be completely and totally paid for!!!</p>
<p>In addition, your contribution gives you access to a wide variety of perks that allow you to be an even greater part of the show.  Take a look to the right side of the page to see our many amazing perks, everything from a mention in the program, to a personalized thank you song from our entire cast, to free invites to our opening night party!  We want to make sure that you understand just how happy we are to have you be a part of our passion.</p>
<p>We have the versatility of experience (from Broadway regulars to festival veterans) and the utter willpower to make this show a unique theatrical experience for all.  Your investment will be utilized to the full extent of its value and beyond.  It is our goal to show you what your contribution can accomplish in the hands of determined and impassioned creators.</p>

<h3>Why This Show?</h3>
<p>Though the specifics of this strange historical event might seem shocking, we find a surprising amount of parallels between 897 and 2017.  Spectacle over substance, in political, social, and personal spheres, is nothing new, and has taken many shocking forms over the centuries.  The show does not seek to proselytize, teach, or scold.  We simply wish to explore innate tendencies toward control and categorization that end up conflicting with our unique ability to show altruism and empathy, and how a few individuals navigated these trappings while living in a famously corrupt and immoral time.</p>
<p>Also, there's a part where the dead pope's severed fingers come to life as a Ronettes/Supremes-type group and sing about flowers.</p>

<p><u><i><strong>Archiving, Preserving &amp; Restoring</strong></i></u></p>
<p>Some years ago while living in my loft in Pilsen, I went to the upper loft to retrieve a tape of an Orchid Show, and what I found were ants: They had invaded and were feasting on all of my tapes. Stunned and not sure what to do, I put the tapes into the freezer to kill the ants, but then I just had cold tapes filled with dead ants. Heart broken, I finally threw them all away. Luckily, Peter Neville who documented most of the Milly shows from it’s beginning at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lounge_Ax"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Lounge Ax</i></a>, made copies of most of the masters before he gave them to me. Some shows are lost forever, but many are still on tape. However, that tape is deteriorating quickly, some of them are well over 25 years old dating back to early 1988. It is, again, my great luck that Peter has become a web-God, and determined to save what we have left (and reduce his clutter), he proposed doing this Indiegogo campaign to archive what remains. I resisted the idea of asking for help, but he was patient, very patient. And then I realized that what has always made the Milly shows great is you, the audience. Performers say it to me over and over again, “You have the best audiences.” So it is fitting that we should do this together as we have always done, because without you, there is no show. Together we will ‘take what God gave us (and the ants haven’t eaten) put a couple a sequins on it’ and get ourselves an archive!  </p>
<p>Thank you for it all,</p>
<p>Brigid (aka Milly May Smithy) xoxo</p>
<p>What it would entail is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digitizing and archiving of the estimated 30-40 shows (or more). </li>
<li>Restoring some of the poor quality of the older shows. </li>
<li>Building a website to upload and link videos, photos and stories for your viewing pleasure.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><u><i><strong>How Will It Work?</strong></i></u></p>
<p>Digitizing, logging and archiving all of these tapes will be very time consuming. Not to mention, restoring some. The entire project will take over two months, but it will be an ongoing project including additions and uploads of newer shows.  </p>
<p>We will have the entire available library of shows digitized and ready for viewing on the website. This would require purchasing domain, hosting, designing and layout of website including uploads and links. In addition, we also need to purchase multiple data storage devices including protective back-ups.</p>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The Second Breakfast Company (2BCo) is a not-for-profit youth theatre company, founded by youths, for youths. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, we ran an open call for scripts. We had hoped to profile young writers and empower young voices with the platform to hold important conversations. When we came across the two plays, Lemmings and The Wedding Pig, we were struck by how real the stories were and how accurately reflective they were of the societal issues we face today that we wanted nothing more than to present these works to the world. </p>
<p>However, with double the script, it is double the cost of presenting the works on stage. This, along with the limited arts funding available *and the sensitive nature of our play* has made the realities of staging the two plays a struggle for a youth theatre company such as ours.</p>
<p>These developments have placed us in a difficult situation where spending needs to be further-streamlined and selling tickets to schools and youths have to be put on hold in case the rating we eventually get disallows these young people from watching.</p>
<p>The team has taken these events in our stride. We've had to hence re-evaluate our strategies and find ways of raising the funds needed to cover basic costs. We know - there have been a few other crowdfunding campaigns going around. We understand. But we still believe that there will be kind people who are willing/able to help out. We strongly believe in the two plays, and we can only TRY to convince everyone else. As such, the campaign will carry on till slightly after the run of the show (2-5 November) so that if you need that push, you can purchase a ticket and watch the show and then donate. </p>
<p>We are still learning and we can only give you the promise that (1) the show will be worth your time and ticket price, and (2) we will only do better next time.</p>
<p>At the same time, with your support we'll be able to keep doing what we do to empower youths in their creative pursuits and that we continue to provide a safe and comfortable space for youths to gather and exercise their talents and capabilities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you would like to support but broke like us (LOL), you could help by spreading the word ! Tell all your friends and family about this campaign or have them come watch our show.

But we still believe that there will be kind people who are willing/able to help out. We strongly believe in the two plays, and we can only TRY to convince everyone else. As such, the campaign will carry on till slightly after the run of the show (2-5 November) so that if you need that push, you can purchase a ticket and watch the show and then donate. 
We are still learning and we can only give you the promise that (1) the show will be worth your time and ticket price, and (2) we will only do better next time.
At the same time, with your support we'll be able to keep doing what we do to empower youths in their creative pursuits and that we continue to provide a safe and comfortable space for youths to gather and exercise their talents and capabilities.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you would like to support but broke like us (LOL), you could help by spreading the word ! Tell all your friends and family about this campaign or have them come watch our show. Tickets are available at www.sistic.com.sg/events/clemm1117  :) 
Truly, we really appreciate any form of love and support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are Nozama Dance Collective, a modern dance company based in Cambridge, MA with the mission to portray the bold stories of female empowerment through dance. We call for women to come together, to support one another, as we claim our voices. We have heard enough, we have seen enough, we’ve had enough. Now is the time to embrace that we are enough. This is what drives “Enough”, the third full-length performance produced by Nozama Dance Collective.</p>
<p>Our pieces, along with the works of numerous guest artists, will depict the full spectrum of this concept, from the relentlessness of what women endure, to the celebration of what can be accomplished when we empower one another. We are honored to produce this performance, bringing the community together to celebrate female empowerment. Nozama Dance Collective has been dedicated to this mission for five years now, and we believe that now more than ever it is critical for empowered female voices to be heard through dance.</p>
<p>But we need your help. We are aiming to raise $2500 to cover production costs for “Enough”, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatre rental</li>
<li>Lighting by our incredible designer, Jeff Salzberg</li>
<li>Stage manager</li>
<li>Additional assistance backstage</li>
<li>Printing costs for our posters to get the word out about “Enough”</li>
<li>Rehearsal rental costs</li>
</ul>
<p>We have set our donation goal to $2500, as this amount will fund the production and allow us to donate a portion of our ticket sales to the Big Sisters Association. In 2017, we partnered with the Big Sisters Association to teach dance workshops about girl power and positive body image to young girls ages 9-13. We are so lucky to share a partnership with the Big Sisters Association, as there are so many similarities in our mission statements. We are looking forward to being able to further give back to the organization. </p>

<p>Even if you cannot contribute, we so appreciate your help in other ways! </p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about “Enough”!</li>
<li>Share our dance videos on YouTube and get the word out about Nozama fighting for female empowerment</li>
<li>Visit our Facebook page and ”Like” us!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for your generosity. With your help, we will further promote female empowerment in the Boston dance community, and give back to the Big Sisters Association, an organization with whom we are honored to partner with. </p>

<h2>""Vogel"" : The Streaming Performance Project</h2>
<h3><strong>Project Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Vögel is a new choreographic women solo series choreographed by Christine Bonansea. </p>
<p>The space is set up as a container, an emotional space that questions our sensitive and social relationship to the world. Our perception of the self is dramatically reflected when the condition of isolation provokes a radical attempt for escape. The work is inspired by the philosophical essay: “LE CORPS UTOPIQUE” from Michel Foucault.</p>
<p><i>""We are trapped in our body restrained by the large space with a dimensionality that emphasizes our limitations, a “pitiless place”. However the body might be also a unique space where the perception and creativity has the potential to develop: ‘the body incomprehensible, penetrable, opaque, open and closed, the utopian body’. The body is visible, for example, through others and through looking in a mirror, but also strangely invisible, thoroughly traversed with excitement and desires and, for Foucault, the origin and model of our utopian imagination.”</i></p>
<p><i>The body is actually ‘always elsewhere’, a placeless site that is forever travelling through, and to, different spaces, with the tremendous power to imagine and realise utopias.""</i></p>
<p>The series demonstrates the various qualities of each interpreter despite the systematic dramatic outcome.

<h3><strong>The Story: Where we want to achieve?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are trapped in our body restrained by the large space with a dimensionality that emphasizes our limitations, a “pitiless place”. However the body might be also a unique space where the perception and creativity has the potential to develop: ‘the body incomprehensible, penetrable, opaque, open and closed, the utopian body’. The body is visible, for example, through others and through looking in a mirror, but also strangely invisible, thoroughly traversed with excitement and desires and, for Foucault, the origin and model of our utopian imagination.”The contrast in between the body and its environnement evokes an emotional tension, questioning our sensitive and social relationship to the world. Our perception of the self is dramatically reflected when the condition of isolation provokes a radical attempt for escape. The work is inspired by the philosophical essay: “LE CORPS UTOPIQUE” from Michel Foucault. </p> <p>The body is actually ‘always elsewhere’, a placeless site that is forever travelling through, and to, different spaces, with the tremendous power to imagine and realise utopias.</p>
<p>The series demonstrates the unique qualities of the dancer interpreter within the systematic dramatic outcome for each piece. The scenic elements are chosen to increase the dimension of the tragedy using light frequencies and sound installation that increase the pressure and the weight of the space over the body.</p>

CBC ""Christine Bonansea Company"" is a contemporary dance company formed by Christine Bonansea, who is an US-European dancer and choreographer with 20 years of international experience in conceiving, directing/choreographing and performing movement-based works.  

 

""Vogel"" : The Streaming Performance Project
Project Overview
Vögel is a new choreographic women solo series choreographed by Christine Bonansea. 
The space is set up as a container, an emotional space that questions our sensitive and social relationship to the world. Our perception of the self is dramatically reflected when the condition of isolation provokes a radical attempt for escape. The work is inspired by the philosophical essay: “LE CORPS UTOPIQUE” from Michel Foucault.
""We are trapped in our body restrained by the large space with a dimensionality that emphasizes our limitations, a “pitiless place”. However the body might be also a unique space where the perception and creativity has the potential to develop: ‘the body incomprehensible, penetrable, opaque, open and closed, the utopian body’. The body is visible, for example, through others and through looking in a mirror, but also strangely invisible, thoroughly traversed with excitement and desires and, for Foucault, the origin and model of our utopian imagination.”
The body is actually ‘always elsewhere’, a placeless site that is forever travelling through, and to, different spaces, with the tremendous power to imagine and realise utopias.""
The series demonstrates the various qualities of each interpreter despite the systematic dramatic outcome. The space revealed by the cut of lights and the sound density installation will emphasize the scale and extreme tension where the body is trapped. The scenic elements combined are chosen to increase the dimension of the tragedy, showing the incap acity to escape our human condition.

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Sheane T. Kirksey I am the founder and Director of Star Struck Divaz Dance Company, LLC,  I currently own 51 percent of the company,  I like to think of myself as self made motivated entrepreneur small minority business owner, who was raised in Midwest St. Louis MO.  As a young adult I became obsessed with being physically fit and active. Over the years I turned that obsession of being physically fit into a healthy hobby and then I turned that healthy hobby into a mental passion which in turn I built into a small business, my dance company/studio to share my health journey with others . </p>
<p>This campaign will help me to seek greatly needed funds, to relocate this company to a larger studio location that I'm sure will need some repairs to bring the new building up to state code and customer satisfaction. My campaign is so important to me because it will allow the company the  growth opportunities it needs to move forward with business clientele and its annual revenue. Overall I am applying for this $5000.00 loan to help provide working capital expense of running the  dance company sufficiently once we have made the move. </p>
<p>The funds provided by the contributors would help tremendously, by allowing the company the cash flow on hand needed to launch and reopen the larger and better location.  This company move would allow a much wider target market, allowing more client based business along with increased revenue weekly, monthly and annual.  The funds secured by the contributors would certainly be a great impact on Star Struck Divaz day to day over all business success.</p>
<p>What the company needs is the maximum loan amount of $5000.00 is requested on behalf of Star Struck Divaz Dance Company,LLC to help obtain our goal in moving forward with our dance art vision by securing this loan to help relocate our dance team to a into a bigger and better location, we are a local competitive dance team that practices in a shared and rented space six days a week. The loan would provide secure funding for the deposit on a new location and some minor move in repairs, purchases of licenses and permit. The move would generate a more profitable income  for the company.  Drive the annual revenue up by large percentages, projecting to up to and around 30K-50K, this change this would definitely be a great benefit to Star Struck Divaz Dance Company, Llc. </p>
<p>Star Struck Divaz Dance Co. is unique in a lot of ways, one we are a family oriented studio, here we offer one on one mentoring to our youths. We offer competitive cost sufficient services, selective uniforms styles are included with monthly tuition (youths dance team), offer family discounts and client pick up and drop off services with in the studios traveling miles radius.  </p>
<p>If we are not able to reach or meet our entire goal, whatever funds are collected would still be of great assistance to the company.  We would still need to purchase uniform inventory and  some much needed exercise equipment, new marketing strategies will be implemented. Also the funds would help secure the team competitions and travel fees throughout the competitive dance seasons.</p>
<p>This campaign is just what the company needs to move forward in its next business phase,  to everyone who will contribute to our cause know that you too will be helping Star Struck Divaz Dance Company make a major difference by offering our  low cost diverse health and fitness services to single parents, low income families, minorities, youths and adults in our communities.  In turn this will help create and promote a healthier and happy lifestyle for our clients. </p>
<p>The companies project is valuable to my clients, contributors and the world because the services we provide to help maintain and focuses on everyday  physical fitness, health &amp; mental awareness among youths and adults in diverse communities. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge in this business is client retention, the turn over rate is actually kind of high, although I (we) love what I (we) do, it's really hard work spending many training hours with new youths &amp; adult clients. The future goal for the business is to one day actually have multiple studios locations in different states that provides services to minorities in urban communities. I am mostly proud that my business has succumb the start up phase and is ready to move forward in building more capital and revenue along with the fact that Star Struck Divaz Dance Co. allows each individual to gain more confidence, self esteem along with a healthy and positive environment, each time they walk through those studio doors.</p>
<p>I have created Star Struck Divaz from the ground up. Star Stuck Divaz Dance Co, even has a great social media following causing a social impact on three audience crowds, minority youths who is fond of the art of dance and would love to further their craft in it and adults/parents/ supporters all also follow our social media platform, mostly the objective is to keep the audience engaged and entertained, many social media platforms has gained me a high percentage of clients, fans and supporters in the Dance Art World. This social tactic continuously allows the company to gain business the near future to come.</p>
<p>Now, who will help me help the youths and adults of the communities fit and health, will it be you?  Remember there are a many different ways to help out and support. So please be sure to share our story to others to help make this campaign dream to become true and most of all successful. </p>

<h2><i>Who We Are</i></h2>
<p>Founded in 1993, Mammalian Diving Reflex creates site and social-specific theatre and performance, forming deep participatory collaborations with many different communities. We have developed a unique and inventive way of making social practice art, which has helped redefine theatre and performance, expanding the definition to include rigorous community engagement. </p>
<p>We have created work in 27 counties and 80 cities around the world.</p>
<p>Our youth wing, the Young Mammals, is a world-leading model of engagement which has expanded to Germany, London and Milan. Starting with a diverse group of youth from Parkdale, Toronto, The Young Mammals have been collaborating artistically with us since 2006 when they were 10 years old, with the mandate to diversify the arts industry. For over a decade, they have gained access to professional development and creative opportunities embedded directly within the company at home and on tour. Now 24-years-old, they continue to work with the company in leadership positions.</p>
<p>Articulating the methods of long-term engagement and taught at universities around the world, Artistic Director, Darren O’Donnell has written two books about the company’s methodologies: <i>Social Acupuncture</i> (2006) and <i>Haircuts by Children and Other Evidence for a New Social Contract </i>(2018). </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is F2F-IRL?</h3>
<p>Created in response to the social isolation brought on by COVID-19, Face-to-Face In-Real-Life (“F2F-IRL”) is an Artist-in-Residence program that continues Mammalian’s intention to diversify the arts through tailor-made mentorship in social-practice performance focusing on long-term and high impact engagement in Toronto.</p>
<p>Our goal is:<br/><strong>To</strong> build professional development resources for emerging artists <strong>and</strong> create a diverse locally connected community using socially-engaged performance and its rapidly growing practices <strong>through</strong> in-person public facing events &amp; mentorship.</p>
<p>F2F-IRL will run for ten months annually, engaging Toronto-based artists/companies developing projects that work in collaboration with marginalized communities, (ie. age, class, ethnicity, in/abilities, etc). Mammalian will prioritizes a diverse team of artists for the residency via an open call.  </p>
<p>Tapping into what we have learned through our extensive international touring and the Young Mammals’ long-term engagement strategy, we will share knowledge, methodologies, networks, and opportunities with these artists - yielding high-impact results and relationships, unique to the Toronto landscape. </p>
<p>We will also connect with local presenters to co-curate and facilitate artist talks with local and visiting artists. In tandem with these talks, we also plan to host three international artist masterclasses with each artist’s masterclass focusing on different aspects and methodologies of social practice and immersive performance. </p>
<p>We recently completed an F2F-IRL prototype featuring five Toronto artists that were developing projects with our artistic support. Their projects engaged communities of: the visually impaired, people with dementia, asian diaspora, immobile elderly, and gamers. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Want to Achieve</h3>
<p>F2F-IRL offers professional development opportunities for artists engaging with diverse communities with a public community-building event in Toronto. </p>
<p>The intended outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To increase connectivity</strong>, knowledge sharing, and resource distribution within the socially-engaged performance art and theatre sector.</li>
<li>
<strong>To use socially-engaged practice</strong> to highlight engagement with diverse and marginalized communities in Toronto.</li>
<li>
<strong>To strengthen Toronto’s cultural identity</strong> by developing a wider community, deepening a sense of belonging as well as amplifying the voices of new and emerging artists of varied backgrounds both nationally and internationally. </li>
<li>
<strong>To diversify the arts industry.</strong><br/> </li>
</ul>

<h2><i>The Breakdown</i></h2>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your Donation Supports</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The total cost of F2F-IRL will come to a little over $70,000. This isn’t a small chunk of change. Grants have given us a leg up to meet this goal, although they do not come close to covering the entire cost of the initiative. Even though our campaign goal is set at $5,000, any amount of support we receive in excess of this goal will go a very long way in helping us cover the full-cost of this initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The fully funded model of F2F-IRL will have the following elements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Social Practice Intensive: </strong>The launch of F2F-IRL will feature a week long public intensive covering the social practice topics of ethics, methodologies, research, and form. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>10 study group sessions:</strong> Once a month, with Mammalian, the artists give peer-to-peer feedback and constructively critique each others’ projects from seed idea to performable work.  </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>10 one-on-one feedback meetings:</strong> Mammalian provides dramaturgical feedback to each project individually as they develop.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Production support: </strong>The F2F-IRL Producer provides logistical production mentorship (grant writing support, budgeting, scheduling, creating artistic contracts, etc.) for each project. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Public presentation showcase to industry peers: </strong>Closing the residency, Mammalian will invite high-level industry professionals, offering the artists a platform to pitch to future collaborators. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>4 Local Artist Talks:</strong> Connecting with local presenters, we will ask them to co-curate artist talks by visiting or local artists, focusing on their inspirations and research methodologies. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>3 International Artist Masterclasses: </strong>Mammalian will host three international artists throughout F2F-IRL, with each artist’s masterclass focusing on different aspects and methodologies of social practice and immersive performance. These masterclasses will be open to the general public for a small fee. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The above consists of costs such as artist fees, venue rental, equipment rental, marketing, hospitality, travel costs and the producer’s wage, which when totalled, is a substantial investment in the future of the Toronto performing arts industry. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Should we not be able to obtain the funding necessary to afford all of these elements, we will unfortunately face the need to postpone the International Artist Masterclasses and trim down the artist fees for the F2F-IRL artists. </span></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
Founded in 1993, Mammalian Diving Reflex creates site and social-specific theatre and performance, forming deep participatory collaborations with many different communities. We have developed a unique and inventive way of making social practice art, which has helped redefine theatre and performance, expanding the definition to include rigorous community engagement. 
We have created work in 27 counties and 80 cities around the world.
Our youth wing, the Young Mammals, is a world-leading model of engagement which has expanded to Germany, London and Milan. Starting with a diverse group of youth from Parkdale, Toronto, The Young Mammals have been collaborating artistically with us since 2006 when they were 10 years old, with the mandate to diversify the arts industry. For over a decade, they have gained access to professional development and creative opportunities embedded directly within the company at home and on tour. Now 24-years-old, they continue to work with the company in leadership positions.
Articulating the methods of long-term engagement and taught at universities around the world, Artistic Director, Darren O’Donnell has written two books about the company’s methodologies: Social Acupuncture (2006) and Haircuts by Children and Other Evidence for a New Social Contract (2018). 
 

What is F2F-IRL?
Created in response to the social isolation brought on by COVID-19, Face-to-Face In-Real-Life (“F2F-IRL”) is an Artist-in-Residence program that continues Mammalian’s intention to diversify the arts through tailor-made mentorship in social-practice performance focusing on long-term and high impact engagement in Toronto.
Our goal is:To build professional development resources for emerging artists and create a diverse locally connected community using socially-engaged performance and its rapidly growing practices through in-person public facing events & mentorship.
F2F-IRL will run for ten months annually, engaging Toronto-based artists/companies developing projects that work in collaboration with marginalized communities, (ie. age, class, ethnicity, in/abilities, etc). Mammalian will prioritizes a diverse team of artists for the residency via an open call.  
Tapping into what we have learned through our extensive international touring and the Young Mammals’ long-term engagement strategy, we will share knowledge, methodologies, networks, and opportunities with these artists - yielding high-impact results and relationships, unique to the Toronto landscape. 
We will also connect with local presenters to co-curate and facilitate artist talks with local and visiting artists. In tandem with these talks, we also plan to host three international artist masterclasses with each artist’s masterclass focusing on different aspects and methodologies of social practice and immersive performance. 
We recently completed an F2F-IRL prototype featuring five Toronto artists that were developing projects with our artistic support. Their projects engaged communities of: the visually impaired, people with dementia, asian diaspora, immobile elderly, and gamers.  

What We Want to Achieve
F2F-IRL offers professional development opportunities for artists engaging with diverse communities with a public community-building event in Toronto. 
The intended outcomes are:


To increase connectivity, knowledge sharing, and resource distribution within the socially-engaged performance art and theatre sector.

To use socially-engaged practice to highlight engagement with diverse and marginalized communities in Toronto.

To strengthen Toronto’s cultural identity by developing a wider community, deepening a sense of belonging as well as amplifying the voices of new and emerging artists of varied backgrounds both nationally and internationally. 

To diversify the arts industry. 


The Breakdown
Your Donation Supports
The total cost of F2F-IRL will come to a little over $70,000. This isn’t a small chunk of change. Grants have given us a leg up to meet this goal, although they do not come close to covering the entire cost of the initiative. Even though our campaign goal is set at $5,000, any amount of support we receive in excess of this goal will go a very long way in helping us cover the full-cost of this initiative.
The fully funded model of F2F-IRL will have the following elements:

Social Practice Intensive: The launch of F2F-IRL will feature a week long public intensive covering the social practice topics of ethics, methodologies, research, and form. 
10 study group sessions: Once a month, with Mammalian, the artists give peer-to-peer feedback and constructively critique each others’ projects from seed idea to performable work.  
10 one-on-one feedback meetings: Mammalian provides dramaturgical feedback to each project individually as they develop.
Production support: The F2F-IRL Producer provides logistical production mentorship (grant writing support, budgeting, scheduling, creating artistic contracts, etc.) for each project. 
Public presentation showcase to industry peers: Closing the residency, Mammalian will invite high-level industry professionals, offering the artists a platform to pitch to future collaborators. 
4 Local Artist Talks: Connecting with local presenters, we will ask them to co-curate artist talks by visiting or local artists, focusing on their inspirations and research methodologies. 
3 International Artist Masterclasses: Mammalian will host three international artists throughout F2F-IRL, with each artist’s masterclass focusing on different aspects and methodologies of social practice and immersive performance. These masterclasses will be open to the general public for a small fee. 

The above consists of costs such as artist fees, venue rental, equipment rental, marketing, hospitality, travel costs and the producer’s wage, which when totalled, is a substantial investment in the future of the Toronto performing arts industry. 
Should we not be able to obtain the funding necessary to afford all of these elements, we will unfortunately face the need to postpone the International Artist Masterclasses and trim down the artist fees for the F2F-IRL artists.

<p>The Summer Place, is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization, has been Naperville's Community
Theater since 1966 and has launched over 100 awesome productions. Our mission was and is to provide a vehicle
for the community to participate and enjoy quality theater. In continuous
operation all these years, Summer Place Theatre has performed in canvas tents,
tinroof structures, and outdoor pavilions.  </p>
<p>Since 1993, an agreement has allowed us to perform at an area high school, in a 700+ seat Auditorium, where we stage our major productions.</p>
<p>Ticket prices are kept low by our board of directors
as part of our philosophy of keeping the enjoyment of theater within reach of
all our community. For the rest of our expenses, we rely on the generosity of
our patrons and sponsors.</p>
<p>Our financial reserves were depleted a few years ago when we had to pay exorbitant rent during renovation of our home base.   We hope that we can augment our revenue sources by
receiving funds to offset our operational expenses.  Our seasonal fundraising goal is $20,000 - we are sponsoring many fundraising efforts through 2015 - and we are looking to your amazing generosity with this endeavor!!</p>

We Will Think You Are Amazing if You Show Your Support!!!
The Summer Place, is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization, has been Naperville's Community
Theater since 1966 and has launched over 100 awesome productions. Our mission was and is to provide a vehicle
for the community to participate and enjoy quality theater. In continuous
operation all these years, Summer Place Theatre has performed in canvas tents,
tinroof structures, and outdoor pavilions.  
Since 1993, an agreement has allowed us to perform at an area high school, in a 700+ seat Auditorium, where we stage our major productions.
Ticket prices are kept low by our board of directors
as part of our philosophy of keeping the enjoyment of theater within reach of
all our community. For the rest of our expenses, we rely on the generosity of
our patrons and sponsors.
Our financial reserves were depleted a few years ago when we had to pay exorbitant rent during renovation of our home base.   We hope that we can augment our revenue sources by
receiving funds to offset our operational expenses.  Our seasonal fundraising goal is $20,000 - we are sponsoring many fundraising efforts through 2015 - and we are looking to your amazing generosity with this endeavor!!
How You Can Help
As rising costs continue to affect our organization, our needs are greater!  The 2015 season is bound for greatness:  ""Spamalot,"" ""Camelot,"" and ""William Shakespeare's Land of the Dead.""
Your money will go towards: 

Costumes 
Props (a case of coconuts.. some crowns.. some zombies..)
Musicians for our live orchestra
Designers, Directors, and all those magically talented people
Technical Team (yay crew members)
Set Design and Construction (let's not forget about the killer rabbit)
Press material (posters, logo designs and postcards)

So what will you get in return for your support?

Our endless gratitude, friendship and air kisses
Some amazing perks listed over THERE ---->
All of your donations are tax deductible to the extent of the law.

</div> <p></p>
<p>We intend to produce the world premiere of “I
Wish To Die Singing – Voices From The Armenian Genocide.</p>
<p>Performances will run from 21st April to 16th May 2015 at the Finborough Theatre.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Commemorating the exact centenary of the
deportations that began the Armenian Genocide, this piece is a controversial
documentary drama uncovering the forgotten secrets and atrocities of a denied
genocide – featuring eyewitness reportage, images, music, poetry from Armenia's
greatest poets, and verbatim survivors testimonies from one of the greatest
historical injustices of all time.</p>
<p>The Armenian Genocide was perpetrated by the
Ottoman Turkish Government in 1915. 1.5 million people died. Today, the Turkish
government refuses acknowledge that any genocide took place. </p>
<p>With the centenary taking place, this topic has
become highly relevant. This piece aims to contribute to raising awareness of
these events as well as pay tribute to those who lost their lives. We want the
audience to leave the theatre profoundly affected by what they've seen. </p>
<p>The Armenian Genocide has been largely ignored by the UK
theatrical community. This production is intended to address this omission.</p>

About The Project
 
We intend to produce the world premiere of “I
Wish To Die Singing – Voices From The Armenian Genocide.
Performances will run from 21st April to 16th May 2015 at the Finborough Theatre.

Commemorating the exact centenary of the
deportations that began the Armenian Genocide, this piece is a controversial
documentary drama uncovering the forgotten secrets and atrocities of a denied
genocide – featuring eyewitness reportage, images, music, poetry from Armenia's
greatest poets, and verbatim survivors testimonies from one of the greatest
historical injustices of all time.
The Armenian Genocide was perpetrated by the
Ottoman Turkish Government in 1915. 1.5 million people died. Today, the Turkish
government refuses acknowledge that any genocide took place. 
With the centenary taking place, this topic has
become highly relevant. This piece aims to contribute to raising awareness of
these events as well as pay tribute to those who lost their lives. We want the
audience to leave the theatre profoundly affected by what they've seen. 
The Armenian Genocide has been largely ignored by the UK
theatrical community. This production is intended to address this omission.

Foundation (Thailand) kindly invites you to join support for social circus
movements for ethnic youth groups in Northern Thailand. </b></p><p></p><h4><b><u>A Background of Makhampom Foundation</u></b></h4><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Makhampom Foundation is a social organisation that works
with the medium of theatre. Born in 1980, we defined our mission as: <i>to apply theatre as a community media form to create connections
between different sectors, regions, and countries towards transforming Thai
society and beyond</i>. We believe in the power of theatre. Adapting various styles of performing arts has been
our signature for decades, not to be the
master, but to communicate, to encourage creativity, to express, to prompt
dialogue, to entertain, to provoke debate, to strengthen cultural practice, to
open the creative mind and body, and to facilitate direct social activism.</p>

The
theme of <i>Social Circus</i> was introduced
to us not so long ago by our marvellous friends from all corners of the world.
After 6 years of ups and downs in our experience, it has paved its way to be
one of our main programmes. Based in Chiang Dao, a small district in the north
of Thailand, we founded the Pang Daeng Youth Circus Troupe of Dara’ang ethnic
group children. There are networks of young circus artists and trainees from
our programs spread around Thailand to bring out the powerful message of social
change.<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440833548/gn9jsvbixbre5dock8vo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h2><b><u>The Project and its Important
Impact</u></b></h2>
<p>This year in 2015, we challenge ourselves to take a
step further with a project called “Circus on the Edge”. It is a collaborative
project in which circus trainers from Europe and Asia are joining the journey
of circus/theatre training to strengthen 3 ethnic communities in northern
Thailand through applied circus practices. These communities constantly face
issues of socio-cultural stigmatisation, freedom of movements, sustainability,
and external development pressures. The unique learning opportunities of this
project will offer new perspectives, knowledge, and a toolkit for participants
to fight against the deprivation they are facing; especially as two of the
participant groups are from stateless, displaced backgrounds.</p>
<p>Circus as an old European tradition
occurs in Thailand as a new approach. The emerging popularity of circus arts,
particularly amongst young rural people, indicates an attraction to the
physicality, aesthetics, and excitement of the form and a natural affiliation
with local dance, ritual, and martial arts traditions. However, each community
joins us, not to be circus/theatre stars, but to strengthen themselves for bigger
goals - to protect local environments and traditions, to raise their status and
profile with outsiders, and to address youth gangs, suicide, drugs, and
cultural identity issues. This will then extend through their districts and
collectively create the potential for social circus theatre movements amongst
ethnic minority groups in northern Thailand, with powerful impacts on young
people and social discriminations.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440834390/ppc41s8kssaas3olfau2.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 290px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><h4>
<b><u>Current
Contributors</u></b><br/>
</h4><p></p>
<p>We’re so thankful to the Asia-Europe
Foundation (ASEF) and Arts Network Asia (ANA) who listen and answer to our call
for financial help for training activities. They kindly support 50% of the
whole budget as a part of “Creative Encounters” initiative. A number of
dignified organisations join the support; even the villagers from the 3
communities are glad to put their hands in. However, our dream is big, but so
is the obstacle of sustainability that we are striving to overcome.</p>
<h2><b><u>What We Need </u></b></h2>
<p>Most of the expenses of this project
are, gratefully, covered by now, but we need only one last piece to complete
the puzzle. The training will finish at some point and the kids will go home;
but we can’t stop just yet when the keyword of our community work is
“sustainability”. Groups will be formed who are always ready to work at their
best for their communities. It is essential that, within the first months after
the project finishes, each group continues working in their community using
what they have learnt from the project. And here we are now, at the point where
we kindly ask you to support our dreams.</p>
<p>We calculated the factors that each
group would need for their starting point, and we found that there are 2 main
necessary parts:</p>
<p><u>1.<span>  </span>Group Founding and Management</u>
- We’re not talking about construction of buildings, but there are still items
needed for work. We set the figure of USD 1,000 for each group to be used for:</p>
<p><i>a.<span>  </span>Stationeries</i>– notebooks,
boards, pens, A4 and flipchart paper, etc.</p>
<p><i>b.<span>  </span>Meals and Travel for Meeting
and Activity Days</i> – they travel from different areas of the village for
meetings and activities, and some villages are as big as a mountain, with no
mass transportation service.</p>
<p><i>c.<span>  </span>Cover of Income</i> – to work with the youth
group means to drop other jobs; including picking
chilli, cutting grass, or harvesting rice, which they earn their living from. </p>
<p><u>2.<span>  </span>Circus Equipment</u>– A circus group
cannot do much without circus equipment. We set the figure of USD 1,000 for
each group to be used for:</p>
<p><i>a.<span>  </span>Making Equipment</i> – some circus
apparatus can be handmade, such as hula-hoop, juggling balls and clubs, poi,
and walking stilts. With this money, villagers will receive some money as a thank
you gift for helping to make equipment for the group.</p>
<p><i>b.<span>  </span>Buying Equipment</i> – some equipment
cannot be made by hand because it will not be safe enough, such as silk,
trapeze, and safety mats. With help from Makhampom’s international friends, we
can get them for a discounted price.</p>
<p>From details above, each group will
have <b>USD 2,000</b> to get their group started. Therefore the total amount for 3
groups would be <b>USD 6,000</b>.</p>
<p><b><u>How We Will Show Our Gratitude
</u></b></p>
<p>For those who contribute, we’re glad
to present very special and unique gifts to you as a ‘thank you’ for your
generous and valuable contribution:</p>
<p></p><p>-<span>

Foundation (Thailand) kindly invites you to join support for social circus
movements for ethnic youth groups in Northern Thailand. A Background of Makhampom FoundationMakhampom Foundation is a social organisation that works
with the medium of theatre. Born in 1980, we defined our mission as: to apply theatre as a community media form to create connections
between different sectors, regions, and countries towards transforming Thai
society and beyond. We believe in the power of theatre. Adapting various styles of performing arts has been
our signature for decades, not to be the
master, but to communicate, to encourage creativity, to express, to prompt
dialogue, to entertain, to provoke debate, to strengthen cultural practice, to
open the creative mind and body, and to facilitate direct social activism.

The
theme of Social Circus was introduced
to us not so long ago by our marvellous friends from all corners of the world.
After 6 years of ups and downs in our experience, it has paved its way to be
one of our main programmes. Based in Chiang Dao, a small district in the north
of Thailand, we founded the Pang Daeng Youth Circus Troupe of Dara’ang ethnic
group children. There are networks of young circus artists and trainees from
our programs spread around Thailand to bring out the powerful message of social
change.The Project and its Important
Impact
This year in 2015, we challenge ourselves to take a
step further with a project called “Circus on the Edge”. It is a collaborative
project in which circus trainers from Europe and Asia are joining the journey
of circus/theatre training to strengthen 3 ethnic communities in northern
Thailand through applied circus practices. These communities constantly face
issues of socio-cultural stigmatisation, freedom of movements, sustainability,
and external development pressures. The unique learning opportunities of this
project will offer new perspectives, knowledge, and a toolkit for participants
to fight against the deprivation they are facing; especially as two of the
participant groups are from stateless, displaced backgrounds.
Circus as an old European tradition
occurs in Thailand as a new approach. The emerging popularity of circus arts,
particularly amongst young rural people, indicates an attraction to the
physicality, aesthetics, and excitement of the form and a natural affiliation
with local dance, ritual, and martial arts traditions. However, each community
joins us, not to be circus/theatre stars, but to strengthen themselves for bigger
goals - to protect local environments and traditions, to raise their status and
profile with outsiders, and to address youth gangs, suicide, drugs, and
cultural identity issues. This will then extend through their districts and
collectively create the potential for social circus theatre movements amongst
ethnic minority groups in northern Thailand, with powerful impacts on young
people and social discriminations.
Current
Contributors

We’re so thankful to the Asia-Europe
Foundation (ASEF) and Arts Network Asia (ANA) who listen and answer to our call
for financial help for training activities. They kindly support 50% of the
whole budget as a part of “Creative Encounters” initiative. A number of
dignified organisations join the support; even the villagers from the 3
communities are glad to put their hands in. However, our dream is big, but so
is the obstacle of sustainability that we are striving to overcome.
What We Need 
Most of the expenses of this project
are, gratefully, covered by now, but we need only one last piece to complete
the puzzle. The training will finish at some point and the kids will go home;
but we can’t stop just yet when the keyword of our community work is
“sustainability”. Groups will be formed who are always ready to work at their
best for their communities. It is essential that, within the first months after
the project finishes, each group continues working in their community using
what they have learnt from the project. And here we are now, at the point where
we kindly ask you to support our dreams.
We calculated the factors that each
group would need for their starting point, and we found that there are 2 main
necessary parts:
1.  Group Founding and Management
- We’re not talking about construction of buildings, but there are still items
needed for work. We set the figure of USD 1,000 for each group to be used for:
a.  Stationeries– notebooks,
boards, pens, A4 and flipchart paper, etc.
b.  Meals and Travel for Meeting
and Activity Days – they travel from different areas of the village for
meetings and activities, and some villages are as big as a mountain, with no
mass transportation service.
c.  Cover of Income – to work with the youth
group means to drop other jobs; including picking
chilli, cutting grass, or harvesting rice, which they earn their living from. 
2.  Circus Equipment– A circus group
cannot do much without circus equipment. We set the figure of USD 1,000 for
each group to be used for:
a.  Making Equipment – some circus
apparatus can be handmade, such as hula-hoop, juggling balls and clubs, poi,
and walking stilts. With this money, villagers will receive some money as a thank
you gift for helping to make equipment for the group.
b.  Buying Equipment – some equipment
cannot be made by hand because it will not be safe enough, such as silk,
trapeze, and safety mats. With help from Makhampom’s international friends, we
can get them for a discounted price.
From details above, each group will
have USD 2,000 to get their group started. Therefore the total amount for 3
groups would be USD 6,000.
How We Will Show Our Gratitude

For those who contribute, we’re glad
to present very special and unique gifts to you as a ‘thank you’ for your
generous and valuable contribution:
- 
A handmade thank you card from the kids
- 
A Recycled Juggling Ball DIY Kit, supported by Gooseberry Arts Inc., a
Makhampom family member with the same mission of social change
- 
A handmade local craft from the communities
- 
An exclusive DVD documentary of the whole project, with English
subtitles
- 
Accommodation at Makhampom Chiang Dao Art Space (Chiang Dao, Chiang Mai,
Thailand) with community trips around Chiang Dao and a creative art workshop
course by Gooseberry Arts Inc.
And even if we cannot reach this goal,
the money will be divided equally between the 3 groups. We will be extremely
grateful to all contributors who spend time supporting, promoting and helping our
project in many other ways.
All updates about the project will be
presented to the public on our project blog, Facebook pages, and here on
Indiegogo.
Ongoing Makhampom Successes
We always sustain long-term contact
with every community we work with. We exchange e-mails, talk on the phone, pay
visits, and set up meetings to keep each other updated. So there needn’t be any
concern that we would disappear after; the communities are valued and important
members of the Makhampom family.
Our successful track record of projects with social
circus/theatre approach:
- 
Transformative Theatre
for Teens (TTT): emerged from Makhampom’s
will to reinforce society’s health education. Supported by Thai Health
Organization, since 2009 TTT has created transformative networks of over 60
youth theatre groups, 6 associations, and a network of 700 teachers.

For the devil desires a partner, and he isn't picky. The play deals with the idea that evil isn't born, it is created, and that sin is part of human nature.

</h3>We are a group of 13 young people who are part of Belgrade English Language Theatre. This is a theatre group for young people aged 7 and up, giving us the chance to learn about, make and perform theatre of our choosing.<br/>We were lucky enough to get in touch with a similar group to ours in Prague (Prague Youth Theatre) and we all thought it would be a great idea if our group (aged 17 to 19) could find a way of getting to Prague to meet our colleagues and do something creative with them for the weekend; perform plays, do workshops etc.<br/>Even better than this we thought, what if we could make this happen ourselves? Raise all the money ourselves without relying on any parents, organisations, companies? And do it in a way that would highlight our skills and makybe bring a little amusement to others in the process: The Aprifoolathon was born!<br/> <br/><p> </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> </div> <div> <p>To be able to get us to Prague, spend four days there and come back via bus, we need to raise a total of 2000 euros. We already raised over 500 euros through our first marathon Improv fundraiser and this inspired us to do another, with a little more publicity and ambition. </p>
<p>Our fundraising efforts here will help to publicize our next live fundraising performance event:the Aprifoolathon: a live four hour drama improv on: yes April the 1st! If the combination of these two campaigns are successful we will have managed to do what many people told us was not possible and in a way which reflects our own tastes, sense of fun and desire for self-sustainable youth-based art.  <br/></p>
<p>If in the very sad event of not reaching our entire goal we will be forced to travel only as far as the money allows: getting the bus to Zagreb perhaps or just to the end of our street: seriously though, if we don't reach our goal we will continue with other events until we do! and get to Prague by hook or by crook!</p>

We are a group of 13 young people who are part of Belgrade English Language Theatre. This is a theatre group for young people aged 7 and up, giving us the chance to learn about, make and perform theatre of our choosing.We were lucky enough to get in touch with a similar group to ours in Prague (Prague Youth Theatre) and we all thought it would be a great idea if our group (aged 17 to 19) could find a way of getting to Prague to meet our colleagues and do something creative with them for the weekend; perform plays, do workshops etc.Even better than this we thought, what if we could make this happen ourselves? Raise all the money ourselves without relying on any parents, organisations, companies? And do it in a way that would highlight our skills and makybe bring a little amusement to others in the process: The Aprifoolathon was born!  

What We Need & What You Get   To be able to get us to Prague, spend four days there and come back via bus, we need to raise a total of 2000 euros. We already raised over 500 euros through our first marathon Improv fundraiser and this inspired us to do another, with a little more publicity and ambition. 
Our fundraising efforts here will help to publicize our next live fundraising performance event:the Aprifoolathon: a live four hour drama improv on: yes April the 1st! If the combination of these two campaigns are successful we will have managed to do what many people told us was not possible and in a way which reflects our own tastes, sense of fun and desire for self-sustainable youth-based art.  
If in the very sad event of not reaching our entire goal we will be forced to travel only as far as the money allows: getting the bus to Zagreb perhaps or just to the end of our street: seriously though, if we don't reach our goal we will continue with other events until we do! and get to Prague by hook or by crook!
  The Impact We have to be honest and say that Serbia is not the richest country in the world, and that opportunities to travel, be creative, develop our creative ideas are not overflowing: which is why we are making things happen ourselves. We have already made many shows, been on tours and entertained hundreds of people with our own brand of particular theatre, and we hope that our efforts will not only inspire others to do the same but will also inspire us to go as far as we can with out own creative potentials.    Risks & Challenges  The only risk in this project is not doing it, and that is not an option. Some people think it is scary to stand up in front of people, in your second language and improvise, to perform without a safety net: and in some ways this is true, but it is not as scary as being too scared to.

</b><p>Seventeen years ago, Dean decided to die. Now, somehow, he 
has been brought back to life by Carrie, a fraudulent psychic with 
plenty of demons of her own. Desperate to rid herself of her unwanted 
guest, Carrie calls on her estranged sister Mary, an exorcist whose 
extreme views stem from the same root as her sister's: the suicide of 
their mother during their teenage years. Dean seems at home in the 
present day, but as his memories return he is drawn back to the past - 
and is there any point in living when he's not truly alive? Meanwhile, 
Mary and Carrie are forced to face their own past, and Mary's daughter 
Jess is about to get involved...</p>
<br/><b>Our Team:</b><br/>Butterfly with a Bomb is a Glasgow theatre company based on the principle of collaboration. We produced '<em>Rewrite', </em>our first full length play, in 2013 and followed this up with a work in progress presentation of our current project, <em>'Giving up the Ghost',</em> in 2014. Our work as individuals and as a company has also been seen at events including 'Crossing the Lines', 'Stage to Page' and 'Scottish Screenwriters'. Now we are taking our first Edinburgh journey for 6 performances of the redeveloped 'Giving up the Ghost' in August 2015.

The rate of male suicide in the UK is currently at its highest since 2001, and three and a half times that of women. As with anything, there are plenty of theories about why this is (men, ever been told to 'man up' when you're feeling down?) but as with anything, the first step to understanding is awareness. For this reason, we think it is tremendously important that we begin to see more stories which acknowledge men experiencing and dealing with severe depression and suicide. </p>
<p>This didn't start out as a issue based piece; Dean isn't all about his suicide. Like many other suicidal men you're likely to meet, he makes jokes, plays music, flirts with girls.

If we don't raise enough money, Anna won't have a holiday this year, but the show won't suffer. We will need to rely more on the generosity of our actors and crew by asking them to fund their own travel and meals, but we will still have a venue, a programme entry and a great production to share.</p>

</div></div>","Our Project:
Seventeen years ago, Dean decided to die. Now, somehow, he 
has been brought back to life by Carrie, a fraudulent psychic with 
plenty of demons of her own. Desperate to rid herself of her unwanted 
guest, Carrie calls on her estranged sister Mary, an exorcist whose 
extreme views stem from the same root as her sister's: the suicide of 
their mother during their teenage years. Dean seems at home in the 
present day, but as his memories return he is drawn back to the past - 
and is there any point in living when he's not truly alive? Meanwhile, 
Mary and Carrie are forced to face their own past, and Mary's daughter 
Jess is about to get involved...
Our Team:Butterfly with a Bomb is a Glasgow theatre company based on the principle of collaboration. We produced 'Rewrite', our first full length play, in 2013 and followed this up with a work in progress presentation of our current project, 'Giving up the Ghost', in 2014. Our work as individuals and as a company has also been seen at events including 'Crossing the Lines', 'Stage to Page' and 'Scottish Screenwriters'. Now we are taking our first Edinburgh journey for 6 performances of the redeveloped 'Giving up the Ghost' in August 2015. We are:Mary Jo Hastie

 Mary Jo is a busy actor, director and mother. Her business brain, experience at getting the best out of 
performers, and love of experimenting with text and form help ensure 
that our work is always heading for new and interesting places. As well as co-directing Giving up the Ghost, Mary Jo plays strict evangelical Mary, a part which allows her to draw on her Catholic childhood and early desire to become a nun.

Anna BlaineyAnna is Butterfly with a Bomb's playwright and co-director. In her day job she works at a music and performance venue, and she got the idea for Giving up the Ghost after watching one too many psychic shows. When not working or writing, Anna enjoys cats and wine, and keeps a plentiful supply of both in her flat. 

Claudette Baker-Park
Claudette is an experienced performer in theatre, film and television, and plays Carrie in Giving up the Ghost. When we perform in Edinburgh, she will be 6 months pregnant with her second child, which has been written into the script and added a whole new dimension to Carrie's character. As a colleague of Anna's, Claudie has also seen plenty of convincing and less than convincing psychic performances in her time, providing her with plenty of inspiration for her role.
Jay Newton 
Giving up the Ghost is Jay's first project with Butterfly with a Bomb, and he was recruited to play the part of Dean after Claudette was blown away by his performance in Larry Kramer's The Normal Heart. Jay might only have been born halfway through the nineties, but he can rock a Harrington jacket and rock out to Britpop as well as anyone.   Alice RestrickAlice has just finished her Advanced Highers and, alongside playing Jess in Giving up the Ghost, is beginning to pursue a career in film making. As Claudette's daughter she has been part of the Butterfly with a Bomb family from the beginning, and has worked alongside us in Blooded (Crossing the Lines at the Arches) and in our series of performances for Carers Week 2015.Amelia HastieMary-Jo's oldest daughter Amelia also joined the Butterfly with a Bomb family for Crossing the Lines and our Carers Week 2015 performances. As well as helping with promotion during the Fringe, she will be understudying the part of Jess. Tess Hastie-McMonagleTess is Mary-Jo's younger daughter, and the youngest member of our team. As a keen performer, she has already joined us for Carers Week 2015 and will be a part of our front of house and promotion team in Edinburgh. Philip BarrattAnna's partner Phil is a professional graphic artist and art director working in film and TV. He has designed all our marketing material for the Fringe and saved us a lot of money through agreeing to be paid in cheese and tea.

My show 65 Days of Tracy, The Marquis Mannequin is based on true events in my life following the death of my Mother. I had bought a mannequin and to use in an art project, a friend: Katherine: challenged me to produce something artistic with the mannequin every day for a year. So here are the photos: https://instagram.com/jevanspollard/ and Poems and spoken word: https://soundcloud.com/janine-evans-pollard/sets/65-days-of-marquees-the


Well, I didn't quite follow the rules but managed to make something with Tracy the mannequin every day for 65 days, and I am now making a show with Tracy, and Left Hand, which reflects on loss, isolation and transformation. 

The show is a quirky dark comedy using spoken word, moving image and object-theatre to tell a story that everyone can relate to from their own experiences.  If you have ever had wanderlust, needed company, felt misunderstood or lost your left hand please support my show!

What We Need & What You Get
 Going to Edinburgh unfortunately costs artists quite a bit of money, but its an essential step for my show! Here is what we are looking at raising. We have dreamed up some unique perks, check them out to your right. 

Strategic planning for artist, media campaign and promotional materials including producer fees £500
Sound designer expenses £300
Director fees £300
Film and visual effects expenses £300
Theatre hire and space in Edinburgh £1200
Rehearsal space £400
Photography production shoot and promo images  £400
Film campaign and documentation £300
Poster, flyers and show programme design and printing £450
Travel to Edinburgh and rehearsals £350

The Impact
 The show is based on true life events that I experienced after the death of my Mother. Exploring the universal themes of love, loss and moving on in a personal way; having come in as strangers, the audience will leave as a community. I hope the show will touch people personally, as everyone can relate to losing someone, feeling alone but braving the storm to make a new life for themselves. 
    Risks & Challenges The Edinburgh Fringe is a challenging environment for any artist to show work in, but I am working on a strategy to get people to the show, both audience and important people who can help the show grow in the future. The venue is confirmed and I will make the best of the time I have there, so don't worry about that.

<h3>WHAT</h3>
<p><strong>#CASTE</strong> is an investigation into what it means to be an ethnic minority actor in the arts today, specifically the expectations in the casting room that have given birth to BAME character archetypes. </p>
<p>A recent article revealed that more than half the UK's leading theatre companies are employing <strong>less than 5% BAME artists in their professional work</strong> (2013/14 ACE Diversity Report).</p>
<p>Casting calls on a daily basis specify their parts as <strong>“Caucasian” vs. “Other Ethnicities.”</strong> What exactly are the differences expected by these two contrasting roles in the casting process, and why has it come to the point where quotas are a necessity to allow for equality? These are the questions that we will investigate, through an ensemble of black and/or mixed race actors; with the aim to spotlight other ethnic groups in future explorations.</p>
<h3><strong>WHERE</strong></h3>
<p>The Arcola Theatre, London, UK.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>HOW</h3>
<p>Through an Research and Development week as part of the Arcola LABS programme, <strong>#CASTE </strong>will generate a working script and rehearsal structure working with black and mixed race actors between 18-30. We have the space confirmed, and we want your help to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give our performers and creative team a fee</li>
<li>Hire a videographer to make a docu-trailer </li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>Our main project aim is to engage with as much young or emerging BAME talent as possible, and numbers will depend on the amount we can raise. This will be the first round of this project, with the objective of creating a working rehearsal format and structure for repeated <strong>#CASTE </strong>projects around the UK (and perhaps even further).</p>
<p>The outputs we desire from this project, and the reason we are crowdfunding is so we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide paid opportunities for emerging BAME theatremakers</li>
<li>Present two feedback showcases for industry and invited guests</li>
<li>Create a press pack and publicity material for marketing future projects</li>
<li>Create a working script and repeatable rehearsal format</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With the arts being at risk of additional cuts in the UK right now, the longevity of any theatre works and productions are uncertain. Crowdfunding is one of the only ways a new project can get off the ground. That being said, one thing we can ensure is to ingest everything we can from our experience, with the following evaluative  means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback and invited audience discussions</li>
<li>Consistent document tracking and record keeping</li>
<li>Observation and monitoring of artist's personal growth</li>
<li>Qualitative and quantitative data collection through questionnaires for artists and audience</li>
</ul>
<p>And making sure that we are achieving our project aim by asking the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have we been successful in achieving our project objectives?</li>
<li>Have we been successful in reaching our target groups for casting and potential audience?</li>
<li>To what extent have we explored the BAME trends and patterns in the arts?</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Social dances are a remarkable phenomenon. These are dances (such as Salsa, Bachata, Kizomba, Tango, Swing, etc.) that give you the opportunity to learn some basic steps and movement, and to dance with people from all over the world. No choreography, no ostentation, just for fun.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485182769/sxb4mvli6h1bqc6mmnyj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People feel good, toned, refreshed and filled with energy, especially when attending any of the specially organized for this purpose parties or festivals. Well, such events are happening continuously every day worldwide. Anyone who has experienced them, whether or not being able to dance, always remained impressed, inspired, full of positive energy. And the truth is that nowadays, when the whole world is stressed up, busy solving problems, we have got almost no time to stop and rest, to unload the burden from our shoulders.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem is that there are many people around the world, who want to learn to dance, but can’t afford financially or time-wise to do so. A one-hour dance lesson, currently costs between 5 and 20 dollars. Furthermore, it requires a physical presence at a specific time slot. Of course, one lesson is barely enough though. People need somewhere between 10 and 15 lessons to grasp the basic idea of ​​the dance. This makes about roughly $ 100 and 15 hours of your free time, which we all know is often missing. And when a person is introduced to salsa for example, he wants to learn more new things and to attend more parties and festivals. Why? Because it is a passion, something like a drug but with positive side effects only.</p>

Our aim is to create an online platform enabling anyone to learn how to dance, no matter where this person lives or what kind of financial resource they have. The Platform will provide video tutorials (Full HD or higher quality) on different types of social dances from different instructors worldwide. We will start with dance types like Salsa, Bachata, Kizomba, Cha Cha followed shortly thereafter by Tango, Swing and other dances. The lessons will be explained easily, so that absolutely everyone (regardless of the personal level) can understand them in short time. They will be available to watch any time and will be organized by the level of dancing. We plan also live lessons, where people can ask questions. There will be workshops in a specially arranged section by world-famous instructors from various events, also arranged by the level of difficulty. And all this will be at a very symbolic price.Support us.

You can watch this lesson in full version, as well as two other lessons (salsa on 2 intermediate level and bachata intermediate level) in the gallery tab.
 About the AuthorsThea: ""My first touch with salsa was while I was living in Kuwait. That's right - there IS salsa in Kuwait ☺ There I made my first steps in a dance that later became a passion. It's been 13 years since then and it is still giving me the same positive emotion, as it did when I first started dancing. Through the years I have attended more than 20 festivals, congresses and similar salsa events in various ​countries around the world. Currently I'm a marketing director of Be-dance.net - online dance place with over 300,000 views per month."" Deni: ""I started dancing when I was 5 years old. Since then I’ve been competing and teaching Latin-American and ballroom until 2011, when I met my new passion – salsa. At the end of the same year I started dancing professionally, competing, teaching, traveling for festivals. Salsa for me became not only a hobby, not only a profession, but a way of life. Now I’m teaching in my own school ""Let’s Dance"", as well as travelling abroad for workshops, performances and mostly having fun.""  How We Are Going to Use the Budget  Timeline of the ProjectRisks and Challenges- We already have a domain: danceacademia.com- We already have prepared a design;- We signed a contract with the developer and the work on the platform began in December 2016;- We have secured first 12 instructors;- We have agreements with popular websites, festivals and events organizers to promote the project;- We have agreements with videographers and editors.The success of this campaign will allow us to move on to its physical implementation, to reach our target of minimum 2000 lessons and 200 instructors and to share this passion for dancing with many people around the world and teach them to dance and have fun.Support us.

We've decided that needs to change!   
                                        
In January, The Bridge Initiative was awarded a $6,000 seed funding grant by the Arizona Arts Commission, recognizing the need for this project, and providing the financial backing to launch.  We are thrilled that Mesa Encore Theatre is on board as our fiscal sponsor, giving us reduced rental costs for programming, and offering guidance along the way.  They also enable our nonprofit status, so your donation is 100% tax deductible!  And your receipt for your donation will come under their name.
We have a support structure in place to get started! 
So... what are we going to DO??
 A lot!  We're planning quarterly networking events, press outreach, an annual contest to award Playwright and Director of the Year, and a symposium with master classes, panel discussions, play readings, and a full production of our awarded new play, directed by our awarded director.  
But we need more $$$.  So we're trying to match our Arts Tank grant!
...which is where you come in!  Our seed grant is fantastic, but to become the professional organization we aspire to be, we need additional funds.  Here's what your money will go toward:  



Artist salaries (instead of stipends)... we want to pay all of our artists (designers, stage managers, actors, etc.) a professional wage.

Production values.  We really want our set, costume, lighting and sound designers to have good budgets for their work.
All of our programming (except for the fully-produced play) will be open and free to the public.  We need to subsidize the rental space and leader stipends.
Publicity/marketing.  Printing costs for fliers and postcards, playbills, and maybe we can even hire a PR expert!

We have further grand designs and projects up our sleeves so if we're in the astoundingly blessed position of having our funding target exceeded, we'll unveil our stretch goals.
The Bridge has HUGE potential!

 One component of our mission is connecting students and professionals, so the next generation of theatre artists will find local mentors and role models.  Also, by identifying and giving a showcase to female practitioners, we'll remind all the established producers in the Valley of the talent in their own backyard.  Beginning a conversation on gender parity can only help artistic directors and audiences become mindful of their choices going forward.  And we will be birthing a new play by a female playwright into the world, hopefully launching its journey beyond Arizona and into the American playwriting canon.
