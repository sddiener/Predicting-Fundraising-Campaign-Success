<p><b>ABOUT THE KILLER</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Halloween night.  1998.  I pressed my
ear against the wall and waited until I heard the last bedroom door
closed.  I crawled down the stairs, pillowcase full of Halloween candy in
hand. I jammed The Exorcist into our VHS player, and hit play.  Two hours
later, hiding under my Minnie Mouse blanket, I had never been more certain you
could die from fear after watching a movie.  And that was it for me.
 I was hooked on that thrill of what horror filmmaking could do.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Although this video would suggest otherwise, I am not a serial
killer...or a baker for that matter.  I’m just a girl who loves to make
terrifying and bloody horror films.  That’s why I couldn't let
an opportunity to make my Indiegogo video its own horror film.
 I could just talk to you about the film I want to make, or I could
just show you my ability as a filmmaker, and the feel Vanilla Cake would
emulate.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The older I get, and the more horror films I watch, the one
resounding fact that haunts me is that our everyday lives are the true horror.
 How well do we really know the people we call our friends or our family.
 That’s where the idea for Vanilla Cake was born.</span></p>
<p><b>VANILLA CAKE</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Vanilla Cake is about the complicated and controlling
relationship Alex has with his mother.   Tired of her constant insults and
controlling nature Alex is pushed to a breaking point on his 16th birthday.
 At the heart of Vanilla Cake - what we don't say is even more powerful
than what we do.  The secrets we keep from each other is what crawls in
and infests our lives.  And in Alex's case - this is what leads him to
see the world for what it is.  A dark and not so innocent place.</span></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The money from this campaign will go to the production of this
film.  Vanilla Cake has a very distinct 1950's look I want too achieve.
 I have so many vivid ideas of the look and tone of the piece.  So
production design will take a great deal of funding.  I am also planning
on a two-day shoot.  Permits, insurance, and location will take a large
amount of the funds we want to raise.  I have an amazing producer, Margaret Ward, who is
so knowledgeable on spending money when it comes to filmmaking.  She
produced this Indiegogo video and knows how to budget like nobody's business.
 So about 90% of the budget will go directly to shooting labor: paying
actors, makeup and wardrobe, and the art department.  We want to pull out
all the stops too give the affects in this film the love that they deserve!
 The rest of the money will go to equipment rental costs, food and travel
expenses.  </span>  </p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Contributing to the Vanilla Cake campaign would mean everything.
  Honestly, without your donations this film will just be an idea in the
back of my mind, haunting me.  The hardest part about filmmaking is
finding the money to do it.  With your donations you will be apart of
making something come to life.  That’s what’s so exciting about filmmaking
I think.  It’s the chance to be part of an art form that’s main goal is
too make you think about your life in a different way.  That’s what I'm
hoping to do through Vanilla Cake, with your help.  </span></p>
<p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Anyway you get this campaign out there would be hugely helpful!
 Sharing the YouTube link, posting it on social media, watching it until
you have nightmares.  Just getting the word out in any way you can, will
make such a difference!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thank you so much! I cant express how much this means too me.

<p>My name is RODRIGO REYES. I am a Mexican-American filmmaker and I made this film as an homage to my own grandparents, who worked for decades in the fields to give my family a better life.</p>
<p>Beautifully shot, incredibly authentic and sincere, LUPE captures the simple poetry of immigrant life in a way that has never been seen before. </p>
<p>Real farmworkers, real stories. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Clip</h3>This clip gives you a sense for the lyrical beauty of LUPE. It's not really a trailer, but it gives you a sense the intimacy and downright authenticity of Lupe and his unique universe. </div><div><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span></div><div>
<p>At a time when the rhetoric around immigration is incredibly toxic, we need films like LUPE that celebrate the immigrant experience and allow us to step into the struggle of this community. </p>
<ul>
<li>Farmworkers like Lupe deserve to have their story told with beauty and dignity.</li>
<li>This story pays tribute to the many farmworker unions around the country who have fought for labor rights for those who feed our society. </li>
<li>I have devoted my career to telling stories from the immigrant experience and LUPE is one step further in my path as a filmmaker. </li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>My team and I are down to the wire. The film is ready for its World Premiere at a major film festival in the coming months, but we desperately need your help to make it across the finish line!</p> <ul> <li>We are asking for 10K to cover sound, color and mastering, all expensive professional processes that will add quality to our film and that are essential to being able to screen the film at festivals or on TV.</li> <li>The perks are unique to the film, including a short story an award-winning Mexican author based on my paternal grandfather's life, a conversation with me (the director), signed stills from a scene of your choice, and tickets to our World Premiere! </li> <li>If we do not reach our full goal, we will prioritize sound design above everything else because I want audiences to feel that they are walking with us in the fields and streets of Lupe's universe. </li>

</div></div>","Short Summary LUPE UNDER THE SUN is a first-of-its-kind dramatic film that uses non-actors, real farmworkers living in the heart of California, to tell a moving drama about an aging peach picker who wants to go back to his home in Mexico before he dies. 
My name is RODRIGO REYES. I am a Mexican-American filmmaker and I made this film as an homage to my own grandparents, who worked for decades in the fields to give my family a better life.
Beautifully shot, incredibly authentic and sincere, LUPE captures the simple poetry of immigrant life in a way that has never been seen before. 
Real farmworkers, real stories. 

The ClipThis clip gives you a sense for the lyrical beauty of LUPE. It's not really a trailer, but it gives you a sense the intimacy and downright authenticity of Lupe and his unique universe. The Impact
At a time when the rhetoric around immigration is incredibly toxic, we need films like LUPE that celebrate the immigrant experience and allow us to step into the struggle of this community. 

Farmworkers like Lupe deserve to have their story told with beauty and dignity.
This story pays tribute to the many farmworker unions around the country who have fought for labor rights for those who feed our society. 
I have devoted my career to telling stories from the immigrant experience and LUPE is one step further in my path as a filmmaker. 
   What We Need & What You Get My team and I are down to the wire. The film is ready for its World Premiere at a major film festival in the coming months, but we desperately need your help to make it across the finish line!  We are asking for 10K to cover sound, color and mastering, all expensive professional processes that will add quality to our film and that are essential to being able to screen the film at festivals or on TV. The perks are unique to the film, including a short story an award-winning Mexican author based on my paternal grandfather's life, a conversation with me (the director), signed stills from a scene of your choice, and tickets to our World Premiere!  If we do not reach our full goal, we will prioritize sound design above everything else because I want audiences to feel that they are walking with us in the fields and streets of Lupe's universe.

<h3>The Journey</h3> <p>Our crew has been following young adventurer Alyssa Azar as she prepares for her third attempt to summit Mount Everest. Since she was 8 years old, Alyssa has been pushing herself to the limit to become the mountaineer and adventurer she is today. In 2014 and 2015, Alyssa faced earthquakes and avalanches which prevented her from achieving her goal but in 2016, she became the youngest Australian ever to finally reach the summit.</p>
<p>But this film is about much more than just Alyssa's expedition, it is a story about defying the odds to follow your dreams, no matter what the cost. </p>
<p>We are a group of QUT Uni students belonging to Red Panda Productions. It is our dream to make this film to its full potential, and that's where we need your help. Our goal is to help this story reach as many audiences in Australia and overseas as possible, to showcase Alyssa's inspirational journey and inspire people to chase their dreams.<span style=""background-color: initial;"">                         </span></p>

We aim to enter this film into as many film competitions as we can and getting the details right could turn this film into a winner! Any money we do not end up using for the film will be donated to the NSPCC, a great charity that ties in with the film's main characters situation.   What We Need & What You Get  We are aiming to raise £100 to go towards the film itself.
Any money raised on top of that will be going to the NSPCC (The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children).
Money is needed for props, costumes, actors transport among other things.
You will be playing a vital part in a film that is striving for success!
You will be helping our team create something we are passionate about.
Depending on the amount you donate there are some great perks to be had!    The Impact This film aims to attain recognition and success at film festivals up and down the country as well as in the online world.

<p>Second, here's what you need to know.</p>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Lockard and I am trying to raise funds to direct my first feature film. At the moment, I'm not trying to raise funds for the movie  itself. Instead, I'm trying to raise funds <i>to</i> raise funds.</p>
<p>""That sounds ridiculous!"" you cry. ""I agree!"" I chime, so here's the why: getting money for a feature is no walk in the park. Before I even know how much money I will need for the film, I'd like to have the script broken down by a 1st AD so we know how many days this sort of thing would take to shoot, and then have it budgeted by a Line Producer. The more answers you can give potential investors in the pitch, the better. That being said, let me give some answers.</p> <ul> <li>
<b>What is the film? </b>Co-written by myself and the incredibly talented Maggie Cleary, LEMONS is a buddy comedy about a young woman who has become complacent and taken a back seat in her own life.  Valerie, the main character, needs a little nudge to get back on the right track and figure out what to do when life gives you lemons. However, that nudge ends up being more of a shove when her destiny manifests into a person one day. Through a series of questionable decisions and coincidences, the two girls have to get Valerie following her dreams while at the same time avoiding getting killed by an 80s cartoon-loving, notorious drug lord.</li>
<li>
<b>Have you even directed before? </b>I have! For the past couple of years I've been focusing my talents elsewhere in film, but I'd like to get back in the saddle, especially since I now have a script that I'm passionate about.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Okay, so prove it. </b>No problem! This was the short I directed for the London 48 Hour Film Project. We had to randomly draw a genre out of a hat (we got romance) then had 48 hours to write, shoot, edit, and deliver a film. My team and I were nominated for three awards, two of which we won. Here's the link if you'd like to check it out: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn3K83L-bPc"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn3K83L-bPc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stuffed with Love</a>. This film had a two-day turn around and less than a $300 budget. I'd love to be able to see what I can do with a proper budget, real equipment, and more time.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>So Where Would My Money Go?</h3> <p>Short answer? To several things to help the the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Long answer? See below.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>A 1st Assistant Director.</b> If you're not a film person, a 1st AD is the person on set who basically tells you when you're shooting what and keeps the whole production on schedule. To know what the schedule is, they have to break down the script--and you guessed it--<i>make</i> a schedule. When a 1st AD breaks down a script, it will tell you things like how many days you shoot, which characters are on what days, how many days each character works on, etc.</li>
<li>
<b>A Line Producer.</b> Again, if you're not a film person, a Line Producer is the Head Honcho in charge of the budget. The LP creates the budget, nurtures the budget, and keeps it as their baby. They're the person who tells you if you can afford a location or how much Bob the Greensman is getting paid. They're also the person who slaps you upside the head if you go into over-time.</li>
<li>
<b>Investor Packets.</b> One of the best ways to get people to remember you is have a physical, as well as digital handout. Some of this money will go into printing and creating the packets and some will go into distributing it.</li>
<li>
<b>Equipment.</b> One of the key items for financing this film will be making a 30-60 second teaser trailer to showcase the feel of the film.</li>
</ol> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>""So why should I help support this film?"" Let me tell you.</p> <ul> <li>
<b>The Story</b> in LEMONS is something that nearly everyone, girl or boy, young or old can relate to. Although you may not have had a drug lord trying to hunt you down, most people know the feeling of wanting to follow their dreams even if it's hard. Everyone gets stuck in a ruts, and this story is about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and getting back out there.</li> <li>
<b>Women in Film </b>are far more under represented than men. This is true for both in front of and behind the camera. Supporting this film, even in it's early stages is a chance to get a feature out there with strong female characters, female writers, and a female director.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Are there risks and challenges? Of course there are, but for now, they're limited. Getting people to breakdown and budget the script won't be a problem. In fact, Assistant Director <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3539140/?ref_=rvi_nm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3539140/?ref_=rvi_nm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carly Sturgeon</a> is already attached and ready to break down the script. Shooting a low-budget teaser trailer will be the most complicated, but far from impossible. Getting the actual funds for the film will be the biggest challenge.</p>
<p>That being said, I believe in the script. It's funny, relatable, and has a good message. The best way I can think of to overcome any hurdles that may come my way are to surround myself with a great, experienced team, which I whole-heartedly plan on doing.</p> </div> <div> <h3>I Can't Donate Right Now, Can I Help Some Other Way?</h3> <p>Glad you asked.

</div></div>","Searching movies to watch is a pain, especially when you want to rent or download films. You come across same set of popular films, or would already need to know a few films to look for.


And you end up searching for hours to decide that one film that you want to watch!

Flickstree solves this one BIG entertainment problem- through it’s unique and world class, movie recommendation engine!
We decided to make Flickstree as a result of our personal
pains. Whenever we’d decide to rent or download a movie, we’d spend a good
30-40 minutes just to decide that one movie we’d like to watch. And even
then, not necessarily the decided film was as per our liking.
We realized there is no search process through which we
could experience awesome movie discoveries. While searching, we’d either come
across same set of popular movies through manual genre look-ups, or ask
friends, or would already need to know a few movies that we’d want to watch.
And there were days when we’d just give up on renting or downloading a film,
because we couldn't decide.
Flickstree solves this one BIG entertainment problem!!
It is smart and learns what type of movies a user likes, based on advanced machine learning, and
offers suggestions based on them. Superb and awesome, completely personalized movie suggestions!
Add to it, it
also specifies if the recommended movie is available to watch on popular
websites like Amazon, iTunes, Google Play Movies and more.
The website is ready and now is the time to make a mobile site and an app. You can experience the magic called Flickstree at www.flickstree.com. Also, here is a quick Flickstree Demo video...



Key Features of Flickstree


1. Personalized Movie Recommendation - Based on personal likes and movie choices- using extremely advanced machine learning tools. The proprietary technology creates a unique psychographic profile of every user and enables awesome movie suggestions, always.





2. 
Critic
Recommendations – Recommendation
of movies based on critically acclaimed movies worldwide. Works brilliantly for
users who want to watch movies with cinematic brilliance.
3. 
Custom
Movie browsing – While watching in
a group of friends or family, users may want to browse movies based on most
popular filters of genre, language and release era. Flickstree lists down most
popular and best-rated films in descending order, based on these filters
selected by the user.
4. 
Where to
Watch – It is important to
complete the loop for users by letting them know all legitimate sources of
where to watch a movie. Currently we have mapped 5 popular platforms- iTunes,
Google Play movies, Amazon Instant Prime, Eros Now and Big Flix. We will keep adding
more sources as we move along, including availability of DVDs online and
mapping of the movie to be released on TV.
5. 
Create a
Watchlist – Users can create a
watchlist of movies that interests them. Flickstree notification engine
notifies users once a movie is released on any legitimate online platform as
mentioned above.




6. 
Movie
Calendar – This section works
brilliantly for users who love watching movies in theatres. To keep a tab of
all upcoming movies for next six months in advance, Movie Calendar helps users
know what movie is being released soon. It also gives them movies released in
last three months, so that if they just missed watching the same in theatres,
they can add it to their watchlist and Flickstree would notify them when the
movie is available to watch online.



7. 
Movie
Critic Reviews –Flickstree maps
some 1000 movie critics worldwide. For every movie that gets released and
reviewed by these critics, Flickstree lists them on the movie page. This helps
users understand what notable people worldwide write about a particular movie,
before they take a decision to watch the film.




8. 
Follow Film
Critics – Users can follow their
favourite film critics whose movie reviews they can associate with. Whenever
such a film critic then posts a review, users get a notification, review
summary and a link for the review. They can also browse all reviews written by
these film critics, and choose to watch a movie highly rated by them.




9. 
Follow
Friends – Users can follow their
friends to know what their social circle feels about a given movie, which they
watch. They can also share reviews and movies on their timeline or on their
social media accounts.

Our priority is making sure the image looks nice, and that we get a stellar performance, so most of our money is going towards equipment and paying our actors. Our crew is made entirely of students working voluntarily from our organization, so we have budgeted to make sure they are well fed as well as festival submissions and production design.</p>

Delta Kappa Alpha is a professional co-ed cinema fraternity that strives to create a collaborative and supportive environment for cinematic artists to network and express themselves creatively. We help develop our members' skills, creativity, and professionalism, and to help us understand what it's like to make a film from start to finish and work in the industry.  Where your donation will be going Since this is a student production, the entire budget will be earned based on donations and money raised through fundraisers. Our priority is making sure the image looks nice, and that we get a stellar performance, so most of our money is going towards equipment and paying our actors. Our crew is made entirely of students working voluntarily from our organization, so we have budgeted to make sure they are well fed as well as festival submissions and production design.


   The Crew 

Matias Espinosa - Director
Matias Espinosa is the writer and director of Opposites Retract and a third-year Radio-Television-Film student at UT Austin. He has been screenwriting since he was a teenager, and has recently grown a passion for directing during his time at UT. Matias also loves the acting and casting aspects of filmmaking. Besides film, you might find Matias playing/writing music, going on runs, or sniffing anything lavender-scented. He hopes that Opposites Retract will help him and everyone who is part of it expand their filmmaking skills.


Julian Alvarado - Producer
Julian is a second year Radio Television Film major at the University of Texas at Austin and will be serving as the producer of Opposites Retract. With experience in other Delta Kappa Alpha productions Plus One, Expecting, PB, and The Pyramids, Julian has contributed to a wide variety of jobs but his interests lie in producing and he hopes to explore editing and directing in the future. In addition to this film, he is currently working as the Assistant Director on Silent Night. He is most in his element when he is spending time with his family, friends, and his dog Gizmo. 


Sienna Milanowski - Director of Photography


Sienna is a freshman RTF major at the University of Texas at
Austin and an active member of Delta Kappa Alpha Cinema Fraternity. A native of
Atlanta, Georgia, Sienna has been surrounded by creative energy from a young
age. Growing up heavily involved in art and theatre profoundly influenced her
decision to pursue filmmaking, which encapsulates everything she loves. Sienna
is especially passionate about visual arts such as cinematography, photography,
editing, and design. When she is not doing cool and productive things, Sienna
is most likely listening to The National
in bed or talking to her dog.



Breanna Cruise - Assistant Director

Breanna is a sophomore Radio-Television-Film major here at The University of Texas at Austin and a diligent member in Delta Kappa Alpha. Originally from Dallas, Texas, Breanna loves writing and watching multiple TV series at once.  This past fall, she worked on another Delta Kappa Alpha set, Plus One, and she starred in DKA's spring production last year, PB. Her interests lie in television and new forms of online media. 






Connor Lewis - Editor


Connor is a sophomore at the University of Texas majoring in Radio-TV-Film and Computer Science. He has had a passion for technology of any kind since a very young age, and has found a unique love in production technology, believing that it is a side of film that few people have any interest in. He currently works at Texas Student Television as the operations director. Whether they're producing a concert or recording an interview, he's probably there. When he isn't working on a production, you will likely see him somewhere on his computer trying to change the world, one line of code at a time.
The rest of the wonderful people making this production!

We are also very excited to announce that Opposites Retract will feature an original song from singer/songwriter Chantil Sky Bounheuangvilay!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Short Summary</span><br/><div>
<p>Over the last 20 years, John Shackleton ('Shack') has gone on 44 incredible adventures, travelling to places such as Kosovo, Afghanistan and Georgia, crossing continents, dodging armed guards and delivering much needed food, toys and medical supplies to the innocent victims of poverty, conflict and natural disasters everywhere.</p>
<p>'The Ambulance Man' is a real life road movie following John on his epic trek across to Ukraine planned for May 2016 and splicing footage of his travels with interviews from his friends and family.</p>
<p>The doc will be an offbeat and engrossing celebration of both John and his work.</p>
<p>My name is Irfan Shah. I was the co-writer and co-producer of The First Film, a feature length documentary released in cinemas last year and long-listed for a BAFTA, and since coming across Shack's work, I have become both fascinated and inspired by what he does.</p>
<p>'The Ambulance Man' will be my attempt to capture the essence of what Shack does in a film that can be shown at festivals all around the world and that will hopefully go on to have a further life on TV, DVD and VOD, too.</p>
<p>But more than that - because Shack raises much of the money for his trips by doing everything from chopping and selling wood, to giving talks on his previous adventures - we will also be actively promoting his work, helping out when we can and putting the work of Aid to Eastern Europe on the world stage. This means that contributors to the production will not only be helping create art but will be doing good at the same time.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>A Big 'Thank You'</h3>
<div>Before we go any further, a massive 'Thank You' to everyone who contributed to our earlier campaign (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ambulance-man#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ambulance-man#/</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">) where we managed to raise an initial £872 towards the pre-production of the film. This money enabled us to cover various things such as a Genustech Matte Box for the camera and ferry tickets to get the crew from Hull to Holland. </span>
</div>
<div>But now we need to get through the two week trip! We need to eat, refuel and help Shack and his co-drivers get back to England. We need to pay for the carnet that will allow us to take our equipment out of the EU and across the border to Ukraine. We need a cheap hotel in Ukraine where we can rest and back up our footage onto drives, and we need a small army of batteries and drives to simply see us through the next stage of our mad adventure. In short, we need £2500.</div>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have on the team, some fantastic people, including Kate Siney, who has filmed all across the world for just about everyone from National Geographic to the BBC and has recently directed several episodes of '24 Hours in A&amp;E' for Channel Four, and Rob Taylor who has  filmed everywhere from the Antarctic to the Amazon and who filmed with Bear Grylls in Yorkshire last year. </p>
<p>So we have the talent. Now we have to raise the budget. </p>
<p>This tranche of funding will be specifically towards the trip to Ukraine in May (which is why the campaign is running for just two weeks initially.)</p>
<p>We've worked and re-worked the budget and to do it right, and to do it responsibly, we've cut everything down to the bone and still come up with the figure of £14,000.</p>
<p>This will include camera hire, vehicle hire, ferry tickets, plane tickets back for two of the crew (the other two will drive the support vehicle back); food; basic equipment; fuel; hotels (please note, we'll only have the luxury of a hotel once we get to Ukraine!); critically it will include all relevant insurance and legal fees as well as small appearance fees for Shack and his two co-drivers.</p>
<p>We are getting some of the funding from sponsorship of the van and the ambulance itself, but we really need to fill up the pot with money from elsewhere.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our target then we will have to reconsider the equipment we take and see what else can be cut to ensure that our trip goes ahead - but we will be going one way or the other and the funds from the Indiegogo campaign will hopefully allow us to do this without any compromises.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have yet to meet someone who isn't charmed by a one sentence description of the film - 'it tells the story of a mild-mannered 77 year old who drives ambulances into war zones.' I think it's one of those rare stories that will win over most people.</p>
<p>I think it will lead to more projects about Shack and in the process will actually give a fair amount of exposure to his charity (Aid to Eastern Europe) which he keeps alive through sheer pluck and determination.</p>
<p>It will also provide a platform for the stories of the people of Ukraine and will celebrate the lives of many individuals there who have much to tell the world concerning their experiences over the last few years, which have been a time of great upheaval  </p>
<p>I hope that I have the tools to make this work. The last documentary I was involved with (The First Film) was nominated for Best Documentary at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, was an official entry at Gent Film Festival and was long-listed for a BAFTA. I hope that my experience will help me to take on this project.</p>
<p>Although our page looks quite bare right now, we will be adding to it (video, stills etc) so please keep returning here (and to our Facebook page) to watch as the project develops into something special.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're making a film and making a film is really hard! Anything could go wrong - from things outside our control (natural disasters, illness etc) to things within our control (sloppy budgeting, wasteful use of resources, egos!)</p>
<p>Added to that, we're driving to Ukraine! And Shack himself will be wanting to go places and we don't even know where yet, so anything really could happen.</p>
<p>This obviously means that the risk-list goes on and on - breakdown, injury, bad weather etc. </p>
<p>But just before you despair, I'd just like to point out why these risks aren't necessarily risks to the project itself - you see, we're making an adventure story. If things go wrong - if we are delayed, if Shack loses his passport, it won't necessarily mean that the film goes wrong. It will just mean that there will be more to show in the film.</p>
<p>I think the crew we have (ie Kate and Rob) have spent their careers in tough environments and so we can offer our expertise, our pre-planning and due diligence as counters to the above risks. </p>
<p>Another risk is lack of finance - again, we have Plan B's and Plan C's for this. For example - If our budget gets tight, we can perhaps re-imagine how we tell this story and our financial constrictions may actually force us to come up with more imaginative ways of capturing our material.</p>
<p><span>I think that, as much as anyone can, we have things covered.</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, we have permissions from the participants, a strong vision for what we want and lots of passion, so I think we have the core things in place to deal with any problems as they arise.</p>
<p></p>

</div><div><p><br/></p></div></div>","Short Summary
Over the last 20 years, John Shackleton ('Shack') has gone on 44 incredible adventures, travelling to places such as Kosovo, Afghanistan and Georgia, crossing continents, dodging armed guards and delivering much needed food, toys and medical supplies to the innocent victims of poverty, conflict and natural disasters everywhere.
'The Ambulance Man' is a real life road movie following John on his epic trek across to Ukraine planned for May 2016 and splicing footage of his travels with interviews from his friends and family.
The doc will be an offbeat and engrossing celebration of both John and his work.
My name is Irfan Shah. I was the co-writer and co-producer of The First Film, a feature length documentary released in cinemas last year and long-listed for a BAFTA, and since coming across Shack's work, I have become both fascinated and inspired by what he does.
'The Ambulance Man' will be my attempt to capture the essence of what Shack does in a film that can be shown at festivals all around the world and that will hopefully go on to have a further life on TV, DVD and VOD, too.
But more than that - because Shack raises much of the money for his trips by doing everything from chopping and selling wood, to giving talks on his previous adventures - we will also be actively promoting his work, helping out when we can and putting the work of Aid to Eastern Europe on the world stage. This means that contributors to the production will not only be helping create art but will be doing good at the same time.


A Big 'Thank You'
Before we go any further, a massive 'Thank You' to everyone who contributed to our earlier campaign (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ambulance-man#/) where we managed to raise an initial £872 towards the pre-production of the film. This money enabled us to cover various things such as a Genustech Matte Box for the camera and ferry tickets to get the crew from Hull to Holland. 

But now we need to get through the two week trip! We need to eat, refuel and help Shack and his co-drivers get back to England. We need to pay for the carnet that will allow us to take our equipment out of the EU and across the border to Ukraine. We need a cheap hotel in Ukraine where we can rest and back up our footage onto drives, and we need a small army of batteries and drives to simply see us through the next stage of our mad adventure. In short, we need £2500.

What We Need & What You Get
We have on the team, some fantastic people, including Kate Siney, who has filmed all across the world for just about everyone from National Geographic to the BBC and has recently directed several episodes of '24 Hours in A&E' for Channel Four, and Rob Taylor who has  filmed everywhere from the Antarctic to the Amazon and who filmed with Bear Grylls in Yorkshire last year. 
So we have the talent. Now we have to raise the budget. 
This tranche of funding will be specifically towards the trip to Ukraine in May (which is why the campaign is running for just two weeks initially.)
We've worked and re-worked the budget and to do it right, and to do it responsibly, we've cut everything down to the bone and still come up with the figure of £14,000.
This will include camera hire, vehicle hire, ferry tickets, plane tickets back for two of the crew (the other two will drive the support vehicle back); food; basic equipment; fuel; hotels (please note, we'll only have the luxury of a hotel once we get to Ukraine!); critically it will include all relevant insurance and legal fees as well as small appearance fees for Shack and his two co-drivers.
We are getting some of the funding from sponsorship of the van and the ambulance itself, but we really need to fill up the pot with money from elsewhere.
If we don't reach our target then we will have to reconsider the equipment we take and see what else can be cut to ensure that our trip goes ahead - but we will be going one way or the other and the funds from the Indiegogo campaign will hopefully allow us to do this without any compromises.

The Impact
I have yet to meet someone who isn't charmed by a one sentence description of the film - 'it tells the story of a mild-mannered 77 year old who drives ambulances into war zones.' I think it's one of those rare stories that will win over most people.
I think it will lead to more projects about Shack and in the process will actually give a fair amount of exposure to his charity (Aid to Eastern Europe) which he keeps alive through sheer pluck and determination.
It will also provide a platform for the stories of the people of Ukraine and will celebrate the lives of many individuals there who have much to tell the world concerning their experiences over the last few years, which have been a time of great upheaval  
I hope that I have the tools to make this work. The last documentary I was involved with (The First Film) was nominated for Best Documentary at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, was an official entry at Gent Film Festival and was long-listed for a BAFTA. I hope that my experience will help me to take on this project.
Although our page looks quite bare right now, we will be adding to it (video, stills etc) so please keep returning here (and to our Facebook page) to watch as the project develops into something special.


Risks & Challenges
We're making a film and making a film is really hard! Anything could go wrong - from things outside our control (natural disasters, illness etc) to things within our control (sloppy budgeting, wasteful use of resources, egos!)
Added to that, we're driving to Ukraine! And Shack himself will be wanting to go places and we don't even know where yet, so anything really could happen.
This obviously means that the risk-list goes on and on - breakdown, injury, bad weather etc. 
But just before you despair, I'd just like to point out why these risks aren't necessarily risks to the project itself - you see, we're making an adventure story. If things go wrong - if we are delayed, if Shack loses his passport, it won't necessarily mean that the film goes wrong. It will just mean that there will be more to show in the film.
I think the crew we have (ie Kate and Rob) have spent their careers in tough environments and so we can offer our expertise, our pre-planning and due diligence as counters to the above risks. 
Another risk is lack of finance - again, we have Plan B's and Plan C's for this. For example - If our budget gets tight, we can perhaps re-imagine how we tell this story and our financial constrictions may actually force us to come up with more imaginative ways of capturing our material.
I think that, as much as anyone can, we have things covered.
Furthermore, we have permissions from the participants, a strong vision for what we want and lots of passion, so I think we have the core things in place to deal with any problems as they arise.

</div>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to fully fund a 4-day short film shoot, set in <b>Georgia</b>. This is our first short film, and while we understand that there are roadblocks and stressors with any production, we very much hope that by funding our film via Indiegogo and any other private donations, our stress levels will remain low, and we can pay our cast + crew the compensation they deserve!</li>
<li>By contributing to <i>The Great Outdoors </i>you will be funding the first-ever passion project of Tiny Park Productions, making the dreams of two passionate film lovers come true. That's not just hyperbole - if Mike and Anna died the day after putting <i>The Great Outdoors</i> in the can, they would die two happy schmucks. </li>

<h3>#nosuchthingasafreelunch</h3>
<p>The breakdown of what we need, and what you'll get from donating:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need <b>$9,000</b> to make this short film happen. Can we do it for less? Probably! But the quality would be low, and no one wants to see a low-quality short, and no one wants to work for a low-quality production! We originally said we could do it for $8,000, but we're tacking on an extra thou' for fees [Indiegogo said to be transparent, so transparent we will be!]. This $9k covers it all: pay for our pros, craft services, location fees, insurance, transportation - you name it! Whatever goes into film production, you're helping to pay for it!</li>
<li>If you donate today, you'll get a veritable cornucopia of goodies! Well, maybe not a cornucopia, but you will get cool stuff! We have trail mix! We have Nature Box subscriptions! We have a super neat walking stick, (signed by the cast)!</li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal, rest assured, we will still make ""The Great Outdoors"" - we are bound and determined. It may put off production a bit, but we will persevere! </li>

<ul>
<li>You are helping to create art - plain and simple.</li>
<li>You are helping to pay artists living wages - something a lot of us only dream of. So, in that regard, you're not just making TWO people's dreams come true - you are the personal fairy godmother (or father) of MULTIPLE people.</li>
<li>We are submitting <i>The Great Outdoors</i> to as many film fests that'll take us - again, this will hopefully give our cast &amp; crew a little pay bump, as well as put Tiny Park Productions in the forefront of influencers' minds when they think of GOOD independent film.</li>

<p>Yeah, we're worried about the obstacles in our path. But here's why we know we can overcome them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between us, we have about 8 years in the film industry, and have worked with celebrities, corporations, TV shows, independent film companies, and big box film companies. We have the experience and moxie to see any challenge through to completion, and we are confident that with our network, ambition, and through sheer force of will, we will get this short film made!</li>
<li>Any challenge we face will be solved not by simply throwing money at it; we will weigh our options and utilize our creativity and contacts to create a management solution that works for all parties.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>#timeframe</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are set to start shooting <i>The Great Outdoors</i> early <b>May 2016</b> (please donate even $1 so we don't have to push that date back!).</li>
<li>Perks will be sent out in <b>June/July 2016</b>.</li>
<li>Footage will most likely be shipped off to LA <strong>late</strong><b> 2016</b> for editing and post.</li>
<li>
<b>2017</b>: widespread release on all major video platforms (Hulu, Netflix, Xbox, Amazon, etc.) - or so we hope!</li>

That's not just hyperbole - if Mike and Anna died the day after putting The Great Outdoors in the can, they would die two happy schmucks. 


#nosuchthingasafreelunch
The breakdown of what we need, and what you'll get from donating:

We need $9,000 to make this short film happen. Can we do it for less? Probably! But the quality would be low, and no one wants to see a low-quality short, and no one wants to work for a low-quality production! We originally said we could do it for $8,000, but we're tacking on an extra thou' for fees [Indiegogo said to be transparent, so transparent we will be!]. This $9k covers it all: pay for our pros, craft services, location fees, insurance, transportation - you name it! Whatever goes into film production, you're helping to pay for it!
If you donate today, you'll get a veritable cornucopia of goodies! Well, maybe not a cornucopia, but you will get cool stuff! We have trail mix! We have Nature Box subscriptions! We have a super neat walking stick, (signed by the cast)!
If we do not reach our entire goal, rest assured, we will still make ""The Great Outdoors"" - we are bound and determined. It may put off production a bit, but we will persevere!

 Why your contribution is valuable:

You are helping to create art - plain and simple.
You are helping to pay artists living wages - something a lot of us only dream of. So, in that regard, you're not just making TWO people's dreams come true - you are the personal fairy godmother (or father) of MULTIPLE people.
We are submitting The Great Outdoors to as many film fests that'll take us - again, this will hopefully give our cast & crew a little pay bump, as well as put Tiny Park Productions in the forefront of influencers' minds when they think of GOOD independent film.


#challengeaccepted

Yeah, we're worried about the obstacles in our path. But here's why we know we can overcome them:

Between us, we have about 8 years in the film industry, and have worked with celebrities, corporations, TV shows, independent film companies, and big box film companies. We have the experience and moxie to see any challenge through to completion, and we are confident that with our network, ambition, and through sheer force of will, we will get this short film made!
Any challenge we face will be solved not by simply throwing money at it; we will weigh our options and utilize our creativity and contacts to create a management solution that works for all parties.


#timeframe

We are set to start shooting The Great Outdoors early May 2016 (please donate even $1 so we don't have to push that date back!).
Perks will be sent out in June/July 2016.
Footage will most likely be shipped off to LA late 2016 for editing and post.

2017: widespread release on all major video platforms (Hulu, Netflix, Xbox, Amazon, etc.) - or so we hope!

<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A bit about me: </span></div>
<div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Although my background is predominantly wildlife, I come from an upbringing where purpose is a fundamental part of existence. All my previous films have a strong moral message about upbringing, child care, humanitarian work, the detrimental effects of abuse, whether it be verbal or physical and the importance of doing what is necessary for the greater good. It has played a significant role in what has become my individuality. </span>
</div>
<p>In Cold to the Bone, the message is concise in that it deals with the increasing dilemma in the lack of Obedience, Respect, Discipline and Honor within our youth generation which ultimately leads to lack of control in a chaotic environment, resulting in violent repercussions. The story is told through a diverse group of young scouts in a survival scenario where flashbacks reveal psychological elements to the story.  It reiterates the number one scout rule 'Leave this world in a better place than what you found it'. The film also covers other social issues such as mental illness, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, teen narcissistic personality disorder, bi-polar and social outcasts caused from a missing ingredient within our social structure.</p>Did you know that 1 out of 8 teenagers struggle from depression? 20 percent of teens suffer from anxiety. Teen Narcissistic personality disorder is more common than you think.<p><br/></p>
<p>In Cold to the Bone we parachute into the mind of a teenager suffering from depression who sends the audience into a spiral of adventure and intrigue during his self comprehension and self modification stage of his mental imbalance.  His schizophrenic narcissistic antagonizer is a constant adversary working against everything he believes in. The psychological elements, the social behavior issues and the suspenseful action adventure of the film are integrated into a marketing business module allowing the distributors to promote the film based on artistic criteria. If the film had no marketable elements then that would defeat the object since the idea of any film is to reach a worldwide audience. </p>
<p>So how did this film come about? </p>
<p>Well I have a major infatuation for the great outdoors, wildlife, adrenalin activities, nature, flying and working with youth. I love to live on the edge and push my boundaries beyond that of what I think I can handle. Why? Well, because I get bored really easily and I am of the belief that we are not only here to find ourselves but maybe more importantly to create ourselves, so I am going to continue to push my own limits and get through as much as I can in this life. I want to achieve the goal of creating as much of myself as humanly possible. That way I can feel fulfilled that I have done the best I could to experience as much as I could in as short a time as I could through this beautiful gift of life. </p>
<p>A bit of transparency about me and Cold to the Bone:</p>
<p>I was a boy scout in my teens. I worked a lot with animals, I was a lifeguard, volunteer fireman, youth camp counselor, and horse ranch manager.  I have a private pilot license, worked as a mountain rescue volunteer and as a parks ranger for many years which put me in the front line of danger. Many incidences were with the local indigenous tribesman themselves. When a person becomes exposed to that kind of lifestyle, it becomes addictive because it's forever changing. I am a wildlife film maker and animal wrangler. Still to this day, I volunteer at the animal hospital in Los Angeles and I still do the occasional wildlife documentary, as much as time allows. I also have suffered from depression ever since I can remember but I think the key age was 15. I have never been diagnosed, but it doesn't take a genius to know there is something wrong with you. So I basically took all the elements that I am passionate about and created an action adventure suspenseful thriller with a strong message that I believe the world needs to see. I say ""see"" and not ""hear"" because in film, the primary rule is ""Show, don't tell"".</p>
<p>Why is it so important for me that this film gets made? </p>
<p>Flashback 20 years and look how immune we have become to foul language, nudity, certain things on television, billboards, commercials and of course public appearance! The novelty of a moral code has somehow worn off on our youth and they are practicing the very thing they are being taught which leads to creating this narcissistic mental disorder of attention seekers, excessive bragging, selfishness, having unrealistic hopes, stubbornness, short tempers and having difficulties in relationships, to name a few. The result of none of the about coming to fusion leads to it's counterpart of depression. The film covers these issues very strongly as we tick tock between two characters, who as best friends become formidable enemies.</p>
<p>About the campaign:</p>
<p>By making this film possible, contributors will aid in revealing truthful elements that we as a society can focus on to create a more moral world, A world our youth can be proud of. I hope to set a standard that illustrates the importance of treating the world and those who live in it with the respect and honor that it deserves including ourselves. Obviously the film has a strict entertainment value as a means of luring in the necessary target audience, as we cannot forget that people go to the movies to be entertained. That is where the art lies, in being able to tell a good marketable convincing story with the subtle moral message that it portrays through subtext, metaphors and symbolism, leaving the audience to process those important issues in an ingredient that allows us to relate, reflect and identify.</p>
<p>Thousands of similar films have been made in the past such as 'Lord of the Flies',  'Stand by Me', 'The Lost Boys', 'Basketball Diaries', 'Sleepers', 'The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys' and 'The Edge' just to name a few.  It even stems into animated films such as the 'Lion King' or family films such as 'The Neverending Story'. I could literally go on all night about films that have had a deep impact on the world.  Films that carry a strong subtext about a moral code that captivates it's audience but at the same time allows us to ponder on the idea, that finding a moral purpose is perhaps the answer to the missing pieces in our heart, which will ultimately effect our mind. Cold to the Bone is a complete new concept of film and will take the audience where not many film makers have dared to go.</p>
<p>The business of art and where the money goes:</p>
<p>The difference between development funding and capital funding for the film Cold to the Bone.</p>
<p>The minimum development budget for this film is $65,000 which primarily pays for a development company to package the film. It gets a little intense from here on out so bear with me.</p>
<p>When we talk about packaging a film, first of all it means that the script needs to go through a strict edit identifying the story arc, the character arc, the love theme, the character development, the emotional and physical journey of the characters and of course, ensuring that the film has the correct demographics for it to be commercially viable.</p>
<p>So an analytical company will analyze the script and dependent on how much work needs to be done, a ghost writer will be employed or in this case a reputable script doctor. Once the script is modified to the business module's demands, it then gets a strict schedule and budget. This is an extremely intense process as it entails breaking down every scene, sequence and shot. A UPM (Unit Production Manager) or line producer is employed for this role. This process takes several weeks. In the meantime, Producers will be attaching cast. The attached cast will depend on the budget and of course whose name will help in making the film bankable. In other words, whoever the development company attach as above the line cast, can have a major influence on the banks decision in financing the film based on the popularity of the actors. It gets even more complicated when it comes to distribution which is the most important part of any film getting financed. Once all the correct pieces are in place, the producers then take the package to finance companies, banks or institutions and go about the tedious task of getting capital finance for the film. So you can see why the development budget is so important.</p>
<p>How the pledges work?</p>
<p></p>
</div>Any pledge is welcome! There is no minimum amount other than zero of course, but every cent helps. Just think, if 65,000 people pledge a dollar each, then there is our goal already met. Considering there are 7.5 billion people in the world, for 65,000 people to make a one dollar pledge is of great significance to us even though a dollar may not be much to you. Here's a thought to ponder. If somebody came up to you and asked you if you could buy them a cup of coffee because they need one, would you? Well, this is like you buying me a cup of coffee, instead it goes towards my film.  What do you get for it? I give you Entertainment! How do I entertain you? You get to follow my journey from Los Angeles, CA.  to New York City, NY. on my bicycle... I am going to document the whole thing and give you video's and pictures on a daily bases. You will also be a part of fulfilling one persons dream in making a film that will have an impact on many others. So, in essence, you are making a difference in a number of ways.<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So why this campaign...Why a bike ride?<div>
<br/><div>If I am going to be asking people to help me fund my film, then I can't sit back and expect the pledges to roll in without doing my part. Cycling across the country is a way of me personally meeting with people, personally handing out flyers, spreading the word about the film and the change I believe it can make. Also if I am going to ask the public to help finance the development stage of my film, I can't expect to be paid for it, so there is absolutely no salary in the development budget for me during the development stage. I can support that statement with my previous investors from my previous films and the development company, Moving Pictures Media Group, who will be going about taking this film under their wing. The fact that I get to make the film is reward enough, and the aim is that the film and it's strong message will live forever. The development company have come in below their usual rate since they are aware of my campaign, however, any funds raised beyond the goal will go into better packaging the film to ensure it's success rate in getting financed.<div><br/></div>
<div>The Budget:</div>
<div>I am going to break down the budget to each cost, that way a pledger can decide where he/she best feels they would like to contribute. </div>
<div>First things first. The registered script gets handed over to what is called an analytic company which is a third party independent company, and basically what they do is provide market analytics, sales projections, the marketability of the film, is there a market? Is it bankable? What are the demographics of the film and will it sell? These are some of the things they will take care of amongst other things.</div>
<div>So here is a breakdown of where the $65,000 will be going:</div>
<div>Producers Rep. This dude is a key element in getting the golden key to capitol funding and that is, he/she gets distribution for the film. These guys are different to a sales agent in that they represent us, the producers. They visit markets and get sales projections based on cast, genre and key elements in the film. VERY IMPORTANT DUDE! </div>
<div>Artwork for a look book - These entail storyboard images much like the one's I have added in the website, <a href=""http://controversialentllc.wix.com/coldtothebone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://controversialentllc.wix.com/coldtothebone</a>! They give the overall idea of how the film will ultimately be shot, angles, characters, costumes, souvenirs, make up and props, etc.</div>
<div>Scheduling and Budgeting: This is as vital to the film as a wing is to a plane. It's the very thing that allows the producers, director and investors to know exactly how much money is being used for any given stage of the game. Each day is broken down, each scene is dissected and every shot is analyzed. It is a pain staking process of making sure we don't go over budget and that the film is legitimately budgeted and scheduled and not just guesstimated. This is usually done hand in hand with a line producer and a Unit Production Manager.</div>
<div>Animatics:  An animatic is basically the scene played out in animation form. This is done so that the financiers, crew and cast can get an overall idea of what the scene entails. There are incredibly intricate stunts involved in 'Cold to the Bone', so of course animatics are created to not only allow the camera crew to know where they can position cameras, but also for the CGI (Computer Generated Image) operators to advise as to what the camera can and cannot do for the software to work with a practical scenario (real life in real time image) and of course to help the actors know where they have to be at any given time. Not to give away spoilers, but I need to share at least some of the scenes so that you the pledger can have a clear understanding of what it entails. </div>
<div>We have a waterfall scene, 3 bear attack scenes, a cracked ice on a lake scene, a crashing aircraft, both with a fixed wing and helicopter, an avalanche, an incredibly intense cliff face scene and several very involved explosions. Those are just to mention a few.</div>
<div>Look book compilation:  Although this could be done by me, to add a producer or service company that specializes in this type of creative element, will further influence finance institutions to come on board. Being a jack of all trades may be a useful element when it comes to the overall layout and vision of the film, however, credibility of those involved is key in getting finance.</div>
<div>Posters and one sheets:  Artwork is of absolute importance to a film. I was at the 2014 American Film Market and one film got funding based solely on artwork (so they say). A professional recognizable graphic designer is allocated for this task and can sometimes take weeks. It's a science verses art design that must not only meet the approval and understanding of the audience, but also of the distributors pitching the film to international territories.</div>
<div>Legal fees:  A reputable entertainment firm is allocated for all the legal requirements of the film and if I had to list them, I would need a 300 page novel.  Basically it has to do with insurance, workman's compensation, more insurance and even some more insurance. </div>
<div>Bonding company:  A <b>completion guarantee</b> (sometimes referred to as a <b>completion bond</b>) is a form of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">insurance</a> offered by a completion guarantor company (in return for a percentage fee based on the budget) that is often used in independently financed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">films</a> to guarantee that the producer will complete and deliver the film.</div>
<div>
<div>
<br/><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>The minimal amount of money I can develop this film for is $65,000.  If we raise more than that,<span style=""background-color: initial;""> then as mentioned, we can improve the package to make it more impressive. That's not to say that the film will not be developed in it's best form with a minimal amount, it's just to say that additional information and resources will be pulled in to create a more fanciful presentation and pitch, the things distributors look for as a hook to promote the film and raise the necessary money to secure financing. </span>
</div>
<div>If we don't reach our goal, depending on how much we are able to get, then the money will get used for the more important elements needed to ensure the budget is raised. It becomes a triage situation. A process of illumination, that which is less important or can be done by those who are willing to offer their services on a Pro- Bono basis. </div>
<div>The film industry has a very distinct catch 22 scenario. Financiers want the actors attached before the money is put in and A list actors want the money attached before they commit. So who comes first? This is where the development money helps, it pays for the attachment and secures them to the film. This is done through an entertainment attorney so that they can't later pull out of the deal if the finance of the film takes too long to raise, or if production takes a little longer then scheduled. </div>
<div>So the plan is rolled out as follows:  1) Get a script doctor in to fix holes in the script. 2) Hire a UPM to schedule and budget the film 3) Attach the cast to secure the deal 4) Artwork for pitching 5) Employ a Producer rep 6) Get all legal requirements up to standard 7) Find capital finance and BOOM, we're ready for the pitch. Time is an issue as winter begins in November up in the Utah mountains. Due to the tone, feel and grade of the picture, it's important that there is not too much snow visible but enough to capture the harshness and extreme outdoor conditions. The winter and snow is also a major part of the story.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>This is my second cycle campaign.  My first one was a success in that I cycled the 1300 mile circumference of Michigan to raise funds for my previous film 'The Parricidal Effect'. Not all the funds were raised, but I managed to make the film from the money we had sourced through the campaign.</div>
<div>Teaser for full length documentary of MiMittenMision: Video coming soon!</div>
<div>
<a href=""https://vimeo.com/149076238"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>https://vimeo.com/149076238</a> Feature film trailer: </div>
</div>
<div>
<br/><div>This is why I am doing another cycle in that I found it to be the best way to go out and physically meet with people face to face, announce my dedication and determination in wanting to make my film. Also, if I am going to expect people to pledge, I want to work for it. By handing out brochures or flyers allows the pledger to at least have something to hang on to for their pledge that they can stick on a fridge door to remind them of our campaign and follow it through the process. At any time they can log on to the website clearly listed on the flyers and follow our progress as if they were with us from the start. It is an exciting process. From pre-production, to production through to post production and even marketing and distribution.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

I have always done well in the things I have tried to do and I have tried everything I dreamed or wish to have done. Whether it be flying a plane, sailing a vessel, geared up in a fireman suit pulling someone out of a smoking car, rescuing someone off a mountain, training horses, counseling youth or simply just enjoying the great outdoors.  It's always something I am extremely passionate about and unfortunately I have to choose one vocation above all and I chose film. It's the one thing I believe has had the biggest impact on the most amount of people at one single time. We as film makers have the ability to reach a large amount of people at one single gathering, so why not use that opportunity to send a positive message. I guess my fear with this film would be that there are many layers to the story and I would hate to confuse the audience, which is why the screenplay will go under strict dissection before we attempt to make the film. Unfortunately this dissection process costs money and it's money I don't have, so this is where I need your help. </span><br/></p>

</div></div>","A bit about me: 

Although my background is predominantly wildlife, I come from an upbringing where purpose is a fundamental part of existence. All my previous films have a strong moral message about upbringing, child care, humanitarian work, the detrimental effects of abuse, whether it be verbal or physical and the importance of doing what is necessary for the greater good. It has played a significant role in what has become my individuality. 

In Cold to the Bone, the message is concise in that it deals with the increasing dilemma in the lack of Obedience, Respect, Discipline and Honor within our youth generation which ultimately leads to lack of control in a chaotic environment, resulting in violent repercussions. The story is told through a diverse group of young scouts in a survival scenario where flashbacks reveal psychological elements to the story.  It reiterates the number one scout rule 'Leave this world in a better place than what you found it'. The film also covers other social issues such as mental illness, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, teen narcissistic personality disorder, bi-polar and social outcasts caused from a missing ingredient within our social structure.Did you know that 1 out of 8 teenagers struggle from depression? 20 percent of teens suffer from anxiety. Teen Narcissistic personality disorder is more common than you think.
In Cold to the Bone we parachute into the mind of a teenager suffering from depression who sends the audience into a spiral of adventure and intrigue during his self comprehension and self modification stage of his mental imbalance.  His schizophrenic narcissistic antagonizer is a constant adversary working against everything he believes in. The psychological elements, the social behavior issues and the suspenseful action adventure of the film are integrated into a marketing business module allowing the distributors to promote the film based on artistic criteria. If the film had no marketable elements then that would defeat the object since the idea of any film is to reach a worldwide audience. 
So how did this film come about? 
Well I have a major infatuation for the great outdoors, wildlife, adrenalin activities, nature, flying and working with youth. I love to live on the edge and push my boundaries beyond that of what I think I can handle. Why? Well, because I get bored really easily and I am of the belief that we are not only here to find ourselves but maybe more importantly to create ourselves, so I am going to continue to push my own limits and get through as much as I can in this life. I want to achieve the goal of creating as much of myself as humanly possible. That way I can feel fulfilled that I have done the best I could to experience as much as I could in as short a time as I could through this beautiful gift of life. 
A bit of transparency about me and Cold to the Bone:
I was a boy scout in my teens. I worked a lot with animals, I was a lifeguard, volunteer fireman, youth camp counselor, and horse ranch manager.  I have a private pilot license, worked as a mountain rescue volunteer and as a parks ranger for many years which put me in the front line of danger. Many incidences were with the local indigenous tribesman themselves. When a person becomes exposed to that kind of lifestyle, it becomes addictive because it's forever changing. I am a wildlife film maker and animal wrangler. Still to this day, I volunteer at the animal hospital in Los Angeles and I still do the occasional wildlife documentary, as much as time allows. I also have suffered from depression ever since I can remember but I think the key age was 15. I have never been diagnosed, but it doesn't take a genius to know there is something wrong with you. So I basically took all the elements that I am passionate about and created an action adventure suspenseful thriller with a strong message that I believe the world needs to see. I say ""see"" and not ""hear"" because in film, the primary rule is ""Show, don't tell"".
Why is it so important for me that this film gets made? 
Flashback 20 years and look how immune we have become to foul language, nudity, certain things on television, billboards, commercials and of course public appearance! The novelty of a moral code has somehow worn off on our youth and they are practicing the very thing they are being taught which leads to creating this narcissistic mental disorder of attention seekers, excessive bragging, selfishness, having unrealistic hopes, stubbornness, short tempers and having difficulties in relationships, to name a few. The result of none of the about coming to fusion leads to it's counterpart of depression. The film covers these issues very strongly as we tick tock between two characters, who as best friends become formidable enemies.
About the campaign:
By making this film possible, contributors will aid in revealing truthful elements that we as a society can focus on to create a more moral world, A world our youth can be proud of. I hope to set a standard that illustrates the importance of treating the world and those who live in it with the respect and honor that it deserves including ourselves. Obviously the film has a strict entertainment value as a means of luring in the necessary target audience, as we cannot forget that people go to the movies to be entertained. That is where the art lies, in being able to tell a good marketable convincing story with the subtle moral message that it portrays through subtext, metaphors and symbolism, leaving the audience to process those important issues in an ingredient that allows us to relate, reflect and identify.
Thousands of similar films have been made in the past such as 'Lord of the Flies',  'Stand by Me', 'The Lost Boys', 'Basketball Diaries', 'Sleepers', 'The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys' and 'The Edge' just to name a few.  It even stems into animated films such as the 'Lion King' or family films such as 'The Neverending Story'. I could literally go on all night about films that have had a deep impact on the world.  Films that carry a strong subtext about a moral code that captivates it's audience but at the same time allows us to ponder on the idea, that finding a moral purpose is perhaps the answer to the missing pieces in our heart, which will ultimately effect our mind. Cold to the Bone is a complete new concept of film and will take the audience where not many film makers have dared to go.
The business of art and where the money goes:
The difference between development funding and capital funding for the film Cold to the Bone.
The minimum development budget for this film is $65,000 which primarily pays for a development company to package the film. It gets a little intense from here on out so bear with me.
When we talk about packaging a film, first of all it means that the script needs to go through a strict edit identifying the story arc, the character arc, the love theme, the character development, the emotional and physical journey of the characters and of course, ensuring that the film has the correct demographics for it to be commercially viable.
So an analytical company will analyze the script and dependent on how much work needs to be done, a ghost writer will be employed or in this case a reputable script doctor. Once the script is modified to the business module's demands, it then gets a strict schedule and budget. This is an extremely intense process as it entails breaking down every scene, sequence and shot. A UPM (Unit Production Manager) or line producer is employed for this role. This process takes several weeks. In the meantime, Producers will be attaching cast. The attached cast will depend on the budget and of course whose name will help in making the film bankable. In other words, whoever the development company attach as above the line cast, can have a major influence on the banks decision in financing the film based on the popularity of the actors. It gets even more complicated when it comes to distribution which is the most important part of any film getting financed. Once all the correct pieces are in place, the producers then take the package to finance companies, banks or institutions and go about the tedious task of getting capital finance for the film. So you can see why the development budget is so important.
How the pledges work?

Any pledge is welcome! There is no minimum amount other than zero of course, but every cent helps. Just think, if 65,000 people pledge a dollar each, then there is our goal already met. Considering there are 7.5 billion people in the world, for 65,000 people to make a one dollar pledge is of great significance to us even though a dollar may not be much to you. Here's a thought to ponder. If somebody came up to you and asked you if you could buy them a cup of coffee because they need one, would you? Well, this is like you buying me a cup of coffee, instead it goes towards my film.  What do you get for it? I give you Entertainment! How do I entertain you? You get to follow my journey from Los Angeles, CA.  to New York City, NY. on my bicycle... I am going to document the whole thing and give you video's and pictures on a daily bases. You will also be a part of fulfilling one persons dream in making a film that will have an impact on many others. So, in essence, you are making a difference in a number of ways.

So why this campaign...Why a bike ride?
If I am going to be asking people to help me fund my film, then I can't sit back and expect the pledges to roll in without doing my part. Cycling across the country is a way of me personally meeting with people, personally handing out flyers, spreading the word about the film and the change I believe it can make. Also if I am going to ask the public to help finance the development stage of my film, I can't expect to be paid for it, so there is absolutely no salary in the development budget for me during the development stage. I can support that statement with my previous investors from my previous films and the development company, Moving Pictures Media Group, who will be going about taking this film under their wing. The fact that I get to make the film is reward enough, and the aim is that the film and it's strong message will live forever. The development company have come in below their usual rate since they are aware of my campaign, however, any funds raised beyond the goal will go into better packaging the film to ensure it's success rate in getting financed.
The Budget:
I am going to break down the budget to each cost, that way a pledger can decide where he/she best feels they would like to contribute. 
First things first. The registered script gets handed over to what is called an analytic company which is a third party independent company, and basically what they do is provide market analytics, sales projections, the marketability of the film, is there a market? Is it bankable? What are the demographics of the film and will it sell? These are some of the things they will take care of amongst other things.
So here is a breakdown of where the $65,000 will be going:
Producers Rep. This dude is a key element in getting the golden key to capitol funding and that is, he/she gets distribution for the film. These guys are different to a sales agent in that they represent us, the producers. They visit markets and get sales projections based on cast, genre and key elements in the film. VERY IMPORTANT DUDE! 
Artwork for a look book - These entail storyboard images much like the one's I have added in the website, http://controversialentllc.wix.com/coldtothebone! They give the overall idea of how the film will ultimately be shot, angles, characters, costumes, souvenirs, make up and props, etc.
Scheduling and Budgeting: This is as vital to the film as a wing is to a plane. It's the very thing that allows the producers, director and investors to know exactly how much money is being used for any given stage of the game. Each day is broken down, each scene is dissected and every shot is analyzed. It is a pain staking process of making sure we don't go over budget and that the film is legitimately budgeted and scheduled and not just guesstimated. This is usually done hand in hand with a line producer and a Unit Production Manager.
Animatics:  An animatic is basically the scene played out in animation form. This is done so that the financiers, crew and cast can get an overall idea of what the scene entails. There are incredibly intricate stunts involved in 'Cold to the Bone', so of course animatics are created to not only allow the camera crew to know where they can position cameras, but also for the CGI (Computer Generated Image) operators to advise as to what the camera can and cannot do for the software to work with a practical scenario (real life in real time image) and of course to help the actors know where they have to be at any given time. Not to give away spoilers, but I need to share at least some of the scenes so that you the pledger can have a clear understanding of what it entails. 
We have a waterfall scene, 3 bear attack scenes, a cracked ice on a lake scene, a crashing aircraft, both with a fixed wing and helicopter, an avalanche, an incredibly intense cliff face scene and several very involved explosions. Those are just to mention a few.
Look book compilation:  Although this could be done by me, to add a producer or service company that specializes in this type of creative element, will further influence finance institutions to come on board. Being a jack of all trades may be a useful element when it comes to the overall layout and vision of the film, however, credibility of those involved is key in getting finance.
Posters and one sheets:  Artwork is of absolute importance to a film. I was at the 2014 American Film Market and one film got funding based solely on artwork (so they say). A professional recognizable graphic designer is allocated for this task and can sometimes take weeks. It's a science verses art design that must not only meet the approval and understanding of the audience, but also of the distributors pitching the film to international territories.
Legal fees:  A reputable entertainment firm is allocated for all the legal requirements of the film and if I had to list them, I would need a 300 page novel.  Basically it has to do with insurance, workman's compensation, more insurance and even some more insurance. 
Bonding company:  A completion guarantee (sometimes referred to as a completion bond) is a form of insurance offered by a completion guarantor company (in return for a percentage fee based on the budget) that is often used in independently financed films to guarantee that the producer will complete and deliver the film.



What We Need & What You Get


The minimal amount of money I can develop this film for is $65,000.  If we raise more than that, then as mentioned, we can improve the package to make it more impressive. That's not to say that the film will not be developed in it's best form with a minimal amount, it's just to say that additional information and resources will be pulled in to create a more fanciful presentation and pitch, the things distributors look for as a hook to promote the film and raise the necessary money to secure financing. 

If we don't reach our goal, depending on how much we are able to get, then the money will get used for the more important elements needed to ensure the budget is raised. It becomes a triage situation. A process of illumination, that which is less important or can be done by those who are willing to offer their services on a Pro- Bono basis. 
The film industry has a very distinct catch 22 scenario. Financiers want the actors attached before the money is put in and A list actors want the money attached before they commit. So who comes first? This is where the development money helps, it pays for the attachment and secures them to the film. This is done through an entertainment attorney so that they can't later pull out of the deal if the finance of the film takes too long to raise, or if production takes a little longer then scheduled. 
So the plan is rolled out as follows:  1) Get a script doctor in to fix holes in the script. 2) Hire a UPM to schedule and budget the film 3) Attach the cast to secure the deal 4) Artwork for pitching 5) Employ a Producer rep 6) Get all legal requirements up to standard 7) Find capital finance and BOOM, we're ready for the pitch. Time is an issue as winter begins in November up in the Utah mountains. Due to the tone, feel and grade of the picture, it's important that there is not too much snow visible but enough to capture the harshness and extreme outdoor conditions. The winter and snow is also a major part of the story.
   The Impact


This is my second cycle campaign.  My first one was a success in that I cycled the 1300 mile circumference of Michigan to raise funds for my previous film 'The Parricidal Effect'. Not all the funds were raised, but I managed to make the film from the money we had sourced through the campaign.
Teaser for full length documentary of MiMittenMision: Video coming soon!

https://vimeo.com/149076238 Feature film trailer: 


This is why I am doing another cycle in that I found it to be the best way to go out and physically meet with people face to face, announce my dedication and determination in wanting to make my film. Also, if I am going to expect people to pledge, I want to work for it. By handing out brochures or flyers allows the pledger to at least have something to hang on to for their pledge that they can stick on a fridge door to remind them of our campaign and follow it through the process. At any time they can log on to the website clearly listed on the flyers and follow our progress as if they were with us from the start. It is an exciting process. From pre-production, to production through to post production and even marketing and distribution.

WHAT IS FEAST ? Feast is a short film about the Seven Sins gathering around Satan for their annual feast. Everyone enjoys the diner served by Satan’s demons in its very one way, excited, thrilled and intimidated by the presence of their holly master. The arrival of their sacred and attended meal, a young innocent woman, pauses the feast for a moment: she has to answer a special enigma to save her life. Every sin has its own characteristic. Each actor will embody one sin.  WHAT IS THE MONEY FOR ?            Every single dollar you give us will go towards bringing FEAST to life.A lot of stones are needed to build a castle. As a lot of dollars are needed to make a film ! The money is for : 
Renting the appropriate space, to the story and to the confort of the crew (and in New York, space unfortunately equals money...). The location has to be an out-of-time space that we can't relate to: a space where hell gathers once a year to enjoy a very special and expected moment. 
Production design, wardrobe and make up: Satan and every sin have their own personality, we'd like the visual elements to represent them. They will eat extremely bizarre, repulsive and disturbing food with a frenzy and crazy craving. 
A happy crew and cast makes a happy shoot, and a happy shoot makes a good result ! That includes food, water, transportation...  And without a motivated and well fed crew and cast, it is very hard to work. 
Why should you contribute ? First, thanks to you and you only, a film can be made ! A FILM, how great is that ? And made by an extremely motivated team  who works together very often and likes it very much. Thanks to you, young filmmakers like us can continue making films and work harder every day to make the best of your money.                                            SOME MEMBERS OF THE TEAM....We are a group of students from the New York Film Academy shooting our thesis film. Final film of the program, let's make it an unforgettable memory and our best work !

REGARDEZ LA MEME VIDEO EN FRANCAIS ICI:


Amy is a dark Hispanic fantasy in the
vein of Alice in Wonderland directed by award-winning director Nicolas
Simonin. This is his first production in collaboration with HOLLYWOOD HISPANO, an
online platform specializing in promoting Hispanic talents in Hollywood.


The story: Amy, a young woman disconnected from her emotions, encounters a strange little girl. As she follows her into a eerie dark tunnel,
Amy will face  darkness that will change her forever. 


NICOLAS SIMONIN CARE FOR EMOTIONAL STORIES




This film explores the horrors of child abuse, treated within the genre of dark fantasy. 
The story connects with Nicolas Simonin's sensibility and personal involvement with
non-profit organizations. The goal here is artistic and educational: we want to raise awareness of child abuse, through the strong emotions of cinema.


As you can see in his previous films (see links below)  Nicolas Simonin likes to transport his audience into a unique fantasy world. 
After watching just  1 minute of one of the links below, you cannot help but be moved.


AN HISPANIC THRILLER
""I’m from
France but having moved many years in Argentina & Mexico I became Latino in my
heart. I shot my first film in Spanish in Argentina 10 years ago and  I’ve been impacted by Latino creativity since my
20s. I want to continue collaborating with great latino talents.""


After several years living in Argentina where he directed and produced his first short, Nicolas Simonin moved back to Paris, where he wrote for six years for the French TV networks (TF1, M6, France 2...). His film DERAILED was screened at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and in more than 35 festivals around the world, receiving 7 awards. DERAILED later was acquired by Time-Warner’s Fearnet.com. DERAILED has been chosen by Eli Roth in 2011 among the 10 finalists of the Universal Studio Halloween contest. His following short SEIZURES was screened at Cannes 2013 and received 2 awards at the Seattle fantasy film festival (Best Jury Short, Best Action film). More info here. 



WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP


Your contribution will help cover the cost to finish
this film, pay the post-production, mixing, CGI, sound design as well as cover the cost
of marketing, sending the film to festivals and connecting with audiences all over the world. We want you to be part of this great adventure: ""In all darkness, there is hope: a possibility to learn to be stronger and grow. This is my story but also yours. Making this indie thriller is about sharing a story we all connect to. ""


THE PRIZES
For this
film along with DVD & Digital copies of Nicolas Simonin award winning films we have cool, unique & very creative prizes (get your name screamed in an original video directed by the director, or a complete self-portrait produced by Nicolas Simonin)...you can even get a scary real prop doll from the film!!!


But there
is something else: Nicolas has done 3 award winning shorts and wants to offer you moviegoers, horror and thriller fans – a new community experience online.

<p>We have long term plans to turn this small and unknown pilot into a huge and successful television show! We are hoping that with a high production value of season one, we can grow from there! And we need your help to do it!</p>
<p>Costs will include paying our cast and crew for all their hard work!

<p>Advertising and promotion will be a huge factor as to what you are donating for. If we want to get posters hung up around Los Angeles, postcards by the register at local coffee shops, our logo advertised on Facebook, we need money for this!</p>
<p>And lastly, submission into festivals. Once completed, we hope to submit our web series to multiple festivals around not only Los Angeles, but all of California!</p>
<p>Some donation gifts include CDs, postcards, social media recognition, interaction on Savannah's blog, VIP invitations to our wrap party, and a walk on role to set! If you are feeling especially generous, you can even win a date with Savannah herself! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We got the inspiration for the pilot after we started hearing a lot of people using the term “Insta-envy”, meaning to be envious over someone’s life because of what you see over social media. Which is comical, because it’s not like people are going to post pictures of themselves sobbing in bed. …Unless there is a good filter and a witty caption involved. As much as we obsess over social media, it can destroy a lot of our self worth as well. We are aware everyone and their mother in Los Angeles is creating a unique web series. However, we believe this web series will be a platform for us to start breaking down and discussing the pros and cons of social media, and hopefully recognizing our own self worth beyond the glow of our screen.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 21px;""><b><u><br/></u></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">My name is Lola Acala. I am
the Founder, Executive Producer &amp; Host of The Ledge on Shaw TV
Vancouver.<span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""><span>       </span>I produce The Ledge for Shaw
as a Producer &amp; Content Provider through my Production Company, Lolacala
Productions.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span><span style=""font-size: 21px;"">In 2008, I created Lolacala
Productions and The Ledge show as a Platform for my Advocacy work in Diversity and Equality because I
realized, I was NOT getting ANY decent Employment Opportunities I was qualified
for. If I wanted the position, I had to create it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 21px;""><span> </span>It took me working odd jobs non-stop for the last 10 Years. In between, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science from Simon Fraser University and slowly over the Years, I built The Ledge to what it is today as a show that fights for Justice, Equality and Opportunity for all members of our Communities, especially those without a voice.  And we have done some great work this area since 2008 when we filmed our first show.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">And as hard as it was juggling everything over the Years, my Goal was for us to prove ourselves, by supporting ourselves as we built our brand.<span>  </span> </span><span style=""font-size: 21px;"">And it has not been easy for myself and my crew but our dedication always kept us strong and moving forward and I wouldn't change any of those difficult times. They taught growth and strengthened us and</span><span style=""font-size: 21px;""> I couldn't be more proud of my Team and the work we are known for
today.   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">With us in regular monthly Broadcast Production since May 2015, it's been even tougher for us to keep our heads above water.  We are at the point now where, it is no longer feasible for us to keep doing it all, with no support.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">And so I come to you, (our
immediate and Global Community) and ask you to PLEASE, come and join us and be part of
the work we are doing in the World.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 21px;""><b><u>OUR VIDEO PRESENTATION </u></b></span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">Our efforts to support
independent Television and achieve True Diversity in our Media Landscapes
must be followed, with an indomitable will to in fact see them through.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">Welcome to the Ledge 2016
PRODUCTION Fundraising Campaign!!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">And as an Independent
Broadcast Executive Producer, we are independent
Public Television content Providers and as such that work is not
supported by Corporate or the Mainstream media which at this stage in our
game is exactly as we should want it if we are to remain independent...
quite frankly, its the only way.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">Advocating for those who have
NO Voice, calling out the inequalities that pervade our Societies
that foster unequal opportunities amongst us, highlighting failures in our
system that have caused Harm to others and may affect us all too down the
road, if we don't have those things checked.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">Calling out Government
activities where they need to be called out, as part of the checks and balances
of an equal World, we cannot sit back or rest on our Laurels.  It is how
we tackle these issues and find Solutions that make change happen, it is
how we collectively use our voices, to re-instate the Power that we
know resides, in our very hands.    </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">And now thanks to
the internet..!<span>  </span>This information
Age is one of the most powerful phenomenons of the 21st Century because
for the first time in the History of our World, Humans are
more closely connected like never before.  We as an immediate
and Global Community, together, WE can force and make changes to
situations like we've never been able to do in the Lifetime of our World and
this is an opportunity we must take up and take on, each and every time.
    </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">  And so we, at The Ledge, we
come to you, Our Friends, Our Brothers, Our Sisters here at Home, around the
World, I ask you to support not a concept but a real tool we've been using
to fight and call out injustices, to educate, to inspire future
generations of children no matter their color or where they come from that, WE
are ALL ONE.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""><span> </span>That is the fundamental message and the foundation of our
message in the world.. But we cannot do it ourselves...   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">We need your Help
to support Independent Media that focuses on Immediate and Global
Community Social Justice issues.  The Ledge does that!   </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">This Brand, our show is
not just a Vancouver show, because we get your messages of Support from
our Website and Social Media.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">The Ledge, is a Global
show no matter where you live, we deal with a wide range
of Public interest topics, issues that have value to ALL people in
our World!!..     </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">But we cannot do it ALL,
ourselves anymore.  So, Imagine the Possibilities, the amount of Work
that myself and my Team will be able to achieve throughout
2016, with all of YOU, unwavering and behind us!!!  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">    </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">I have one of the most
talented, dedicated teams in Broadcasting who started with me when I had
nothing but a dream since 2008.. I had no wages to pay them, all they did was
believe in me and the work I do and I assure you that together, we will
continue to seek out issues of injustice, find solutions to right wrongs not
just for our immediate, but also, for all of us, our entire Global
Community.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;"">   So Friends,
Supporters, fellow Advocates, public minded individuals who value the
sweat and labor of Social Justice Advocates, friends who value Public
Television from right here at Home North America, to the ends of The
United States, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia.. </span></p>

Behind the scenes, it is hard painstaking work with the research requiring nothing short of mental agilities. There is no room for mistakes or errors and it requires a lot of reading. I am constantly finishing one research and jumping straight into the next read. We have to be unequivocally accurate,  being able to discern the most relevant facts as they relate to the issues at hand, asking the right questions relevant to our audience..  Then I have to build a half hour show around each topic and go in on the day (it only looks glamourous on filming days coz you get all dressed up for the recording) prepared and as knowledgable as the experts so that I am able to ask the right questions, find the problem areas and hopefully arrive at the right solutions with our experts and Guests.  Then there is the editing which is hours and hours of first, me prepping edit notes for the Editor about final product and they then spend hours and hours more cutting those images correctly. It is such demanding work that we are often working 7 days a week.  </span></p>

Quote


""Do your little bit of good where you are; Its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world."" -Desmond Tutu

 

My name is Lola Acala. I am
the Founder, Executive Producer & Host of The Ledge on Shaw TV
Vancouver. 
       I produce The Ledge for Shaw
as a Producer & Content Provider through my Production Company, Lolacala
Productions.  
 In 2008, I created Lolacala
Productions and The Ledge show as a Platform for my Advocacy work in Diversity and Equality because I
realized, I was NOT getting ANY decent Employment Opportunities I was qualified
for. If I wanted the position, I had to create it. 
 
 It took me working odd jobs non-stop for the last 10 Years. In between, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science from Simon Fraser University and slowly over the Years, I built The Ledge to what it is today as a show that fights for Justice, Equality and Opportunity for all members of our Communities, especially those without a voice.  And we have done some great work this area since 2008 when we filmed our first show.
 
And as hard as it was juggling everything over the Years, my Goal was for us to prove ourselves, by supporting ourselves as we built our brand.   And it has not been easy for myself and my crew but our dedication always kept us strong and moving forward and I wouldn't change any of those difficult times. They taught growth and strengthened us and I couldn't be more proud of my Team and the work we are known for
today.   
 
With us in regular monthly Broadcast Production since May 2015, it's been even tougher for us to keep our heads above water.  We are at the point now where, it is no longer feasible for us to keep doing it all, with no support.  
And so I come to you, (our
immediate and Global Community) and ask you to PLEASE, come and join us and be part of
the work we are doing in the World.  
 
OUR VIDEO PRESENTATION 
Our efforts to support
independent Television and achieve True Diversity in our Media Landscapes
must be followed, with an indomitable will to in fact see them through.
 
Welcome to the Ledge 2016
PRODUCTION Fundraising Campaign!!
   
And as an Independent
Broadcast Executive Producer, we are independent
Public Television content Providers and as such that work is not
supported by Corporate or the Mainstream media which at this stage in our
game is exactly as we should want it if we are to remain independent...
quite frankly, its the only way.
 
Advocating for those who have
NO Voice, calling out the inequalities that pervade our Societies
that foster unequal opportunities amongst us, highlighting failures in our
system that have caused Harm to others and may affect us all too down the
road, if we don't have those things checked.  
 
Calling out Government
activities where they need to be called out, as part of the checks and balances
of an equal World, we cannot sit back or rest on our Laurels.  It is how
we tackle these issues and find Solutions that make change happen, it is
how we collectively use our voices, to re-instate the Power that we
know resides, in our very hands.    
 
And now thanks to
the internet..!  This information
Age is one of the most powerful phenomenons of the 21st Century because
for the first time in the History of our World, Humans are
more closely connected like never before.  We as an immediate
and Global Community, together, WE can force and make changes to
situations like we've never been able to do in the Lifetime of our World and
this is an opportunity we must take up and take on, each and every time.
    
 
  And so we, at The Ledge, we
come to you, Our Friends, Our Brothers, Our Sisters here at Home, around the
World, I ask you to support not a concept but a real tool we've been using
to fight and call out injustices, to educate, to inspire future
generations of children no matter their color or where they come from that, WE
are ALL ONE.
 That is the fundamental message and the foundation of our
message in the world.. But we cannot do it ourselves...   
 
We need your Help
to support Independent Media that focuses on Immediate and Global
Community Social Justice issues.  The Ledge does that!   
 
This Brand, our show is
not just a Vancouver show, because we get your messages of Support from
our Website and Social Media.  
The Ledge, is a Global
show no matter where you live, we deal with a wide range
of Public interest topics, issues that have value to ALL people in
our World!!..     
 
But we cannot do it ALL,
ourselves anymore.  So, Imagine the Possibilities, the amount of Work
that myself and my Team will be able to achieve throughout
2016, with all of YOU, unwavering and behind us!!!  
    
I have one of the most
talented, dedicated teams in Broadcasting who started with me when I had
nothing but a dream since 2008.. I had no wages to pay them, all they did was
believe in me and the work I do and I assure you that together, we will
continue to seek out issues of injustice, find solutions to right wrongs not
just for our immediate, but also, for all of us, our entire Global
Community.
   So Friends,
Supporters, fellow Advocates, public minded individuals who value the
sweat and labor of Social Justice Advocates, friends who value Public
Television from right here at Home North America, to the ends of The
United States, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia.. 
Come!
 ... HELP US!!..
Support our Fundraising
Campaign FOR OUR 2016 PRODUCTION YEAR and TOGETHER we can
get doing, the work that we are so good at doing, serving Humanity,
together.

WHAT IS A LEDGE FAMILY MEMBER?  A GLOBAL Brotherhood/Sisterhood
No matter the level of your support YOU automatically become a Ledge Family Member.  We value each and everyone of our SUPPORTERS and we want to build a Community and Global movement with you.
As a Ledge Family member, our Collective goal is to make our World a Better Place by making it our Life's Goal to LOVE and support our fellowmen no matter their skin colour or our differences. As a Ledge Family Members we choose to make conscious efforts daily to be part of the Solution in our World by using our gifts, talents and abilities to serve humanity as much or as little way as we are able to. 

 As Ledge Family Members, we will learn from one another and create Bonds of Friendships, and with other Ledge Family Members around the World.  Let us create a Global Brotherhood and Sisterhood that is unbreakable in our somewhat chaotic World.  The Impact of YOUR Support!
Our World needs to start empowering a new generation of thinkers and voices outside 
of the Status Quo who are advocating and fighting for a Healthy 
Democracy in our World.  
From WHEREVER
Location in the World you are, you are using your Donations to work side by side with me in Spirit. You are helping me seek and find solutions to issues and together, we are calling
out injustices. 
That is the POWER of what your Donations will allow YOU to do from wherever you are in the World.. 
Come! be part of the Conversation with us! 

  
What We Need 
We need $107k at the very least to help with the run of a 3 person Broadcast Media Production operation including our Community Outreach
initiatives. Your Donations will secure all of our 2016 Production & Advocacy efforts and
work.
Being Publicly funded by YOU
and not having to seek advertisers for our Revenue, protects our freedom of
Speech and our freedom of Opinion without fear of repercussion or interference. 

 With NO Advertisers, we CANNOT be
influenced.  Your Donations allow us to be INDEPENDENT and not beholden to
any Corporate Influence.  After all, our show was created by the PEOPLE and for the PEOPLE, ONLY.
We do this work to stand up for the Humanity
of our fellowmen and World.  We want it to be clear that, 'if
Silence is taken as consent, we will not stop making our voices heard in
matters that concern our World and its humanity.'
And Please, NO amount is too small. Every little bit you send, helps us in BIG ways to achieve our Goals.  We thank and cherish you for standing up for the underdogs in our World who are standing up for others. 
 
 Why Donate?  
   When you support
our cause with your Donations, you will be choosing to take a STAND for Healthy
Diversity in our Media Landscapes by supporting a woman of colour who has had to fight harder to access the most basic of Economic opportunities her female counterparts enjoy. This has been my experience and I am still fighting those barriers each and everyday.  It is why I do this job in the hopes that I can make a difference for future generation Canadians.
 Your Donations will support our entire
2016 Production Operational Costs, which include buying some additional
equipment for some upcoming Projects.  Our Network is so good with
supplying our standard Equipments during the week but we also need our own Equipment, especially on weekends when
we may need to pursue a story/event on Location and most importantly to pursue other Independent projects.
  Having our own ready equipment will give us the
freedom to reach further to do so much more.... and WE ARE SO READY
TO DO EVEN MORE!!! 
99% of the work we do is not glamorous!..It is only seen in a glamorous way. Behind the scenes, it is hard painstaking work with the research requiring nothing short of mental agilities. There is no room for mistakes or errors and it requires a lot of reading. I am constantly finishing one research and jumping straight into the next read. We have to be unequivocally accurate,  being able to discern the most relevant facts as they relate to the issues at hand, asking the right questions relevant to our audience..  Then I have to build a half hour show around each topic and go in on the day (it only looks glamourous on filming days coz you get all dressed up for the recording) prepared and as knowledgable as the experts so that I am able to ask the right questions, find the problem areas and hopefully arrive at the right solutions with our experts and Guests.  Then there is the editing which is hours and hours of first, me prepping edit notes for the Editor about final product and they then spend hours and hours more cutting those images correctly. It is such demanding work that we are often working 7 days a week.  
Your Donations will also help
us with our Community Outreach Programs.  So many people around us
are in  such great need and we hope to step up our Community Outreach in 2016.   When
you donate to our resources, we in turn are able to help others even more. This is a fundamental part of
being a Ledge Family Member.
We HELP those around
us.  
 
Through our posted videos on
our Youtube Channel, you will be able to experience all of those activities and
events with us, Outreach and others. You will also have an opportunity to post your comments and
send us messages. 
 
 I look forward to sharing all of those
moments with you all as part of OUR Collective efforts
as Ledge Family Members doing our 'little bits good' to make our World a
better place.  
 
 
Where More of your Support Goes?  
 Should we reach more than our
Goal of 107k, we will gratefully put that money towards our separate 40k
Company Car Fund, our Emergency Production Fund and the rest towards our
Operational Costs and Outreach Programs. When you empower us with more, we in turn, are able to DO MORE, not just
in our immediate Communities but also too, in our Global Communities at
large! Who knows? You may see us soon in your neck of the woods following a story.
 
I am so very grateful to our
Network that they provide a vehicle for my Production use, but it comes with
a lot of restrictions. Only one of my Ledge staff members is cleared to
drive it and its use does not include other Lolacala Production Projects. Only our Shaw TV ones.  Which is why we ask for your kindness in assisting with this Car Gift request.  

 
Our own The Ledge Company vehicle will
give us more freedom to do more, on our own.   Alternatively too, we are open to accepting a vehicle
donation to achieve this goal, our Donor keeping in mind that, we transport a
lot of heavy equipment.  We in fact utilize Hockey Equipment Bags to ferry
some of our Equipments so the donated vehicle must be able to manage a bit of heavy equipment occupational hazards.
 
Risks & Challenges
To not have the support we need to operate in 2016 will see our entire
Year’s Production at risk or at the very least will mean another hard painful Year for my Production Team and myself. It will greatly limit the work we are able to do in the community and our World, significantly.
  
The Impact of YOUR Support 
Because YOU help us stand up for Diversity in Media
Landscapes, because you help us promote Equality and Fairness for ALL people without a Voice, you will be doing YOUR part to empower Advocates in our World
to keep highlighting issues that promote a Healthy Democracy and a Fair-shake
for ALL people, in our World.
 
Our comprehensive video presentation will show the body of work I have
been engaged in, the past 7 Years.. (please see full episodes of each clip on
our Youtube channel or our Website). 
Some of the issues in our Episodes will reveal to you why it is even
more important we ramp up our efforts in the coming Year.
  
Other Ways You Can Help
Please NO amount is too small in how you can help.  And as much as we welcome any amount we know too that not everyone can contribute but you can still help us
by sharing this campaign with your friends and families who value the sweat and
hard work of Social Justice Advocates. Ask them all to support this great cause and our work in our World.
Share with others too. Tell them why it is important
that together we continue raising our voices to make change to situations in
our World.
Please use the Indiegogo share tools also to share on your wall, send to your
friends asking them to support a great cause and Campaign. Please help us use all of your abilities to get the
word OUT!!!.
Love you Guys so much!!!... xoxox
Thank you.

<p>The dating culture in New York City questions the place and presence of love. It is a common conversation around bars and coffee houses and there have been theatre performances reflecting on it.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Valerie and Ian are friends, or are they in love? Ian has a girlfriend and it's not Eve. Eve is the VIP bartender at Ian's club and is in love with Valerie. Set in NYC, ""Upstream"" dives into the lives of three New Yorkers chasing something so similar. But what’s getting in their way?</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Our plan with the movie is something like this:</p>
<p>- <b>Collaborate</b> with other industry professionals who are creative and technical. We want to play!</p>
<p>- <b>Finalise</b> the ideal equipment and locations.</p>
<p>- <b>Film</b> in January 2016</p>
<p>- <b>Distribute</b> through both 3D and 2D Film Festivals around the world! Who knows we may find ourselves at Cannes or Oscars or both. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Obstacles</h3>

</div></div>","What's happening?
The dating culture in New York City questions the place and presence of love. It is a common conversation around bars and coffee houses and there have been theatre performances reflecting on it. We're bringing a story to film on 3D (also available in 2D) that finds itself tangled in the complexities of this transition. 


Why 3D?
The third dimension has come in as an innovation and change in cinema. It pops out of the screen and brings a whole new level of interaction with audiences. 3D of the Goddard and Gaspar Noe cinema is a strong inspiration for the film.





Synopsis
Valerie and Ian are friends, or are they in love? Ian has a girlfriend and it's not Eve. Eve is the VIP bartender at Ian's club and is in love with Valerie. Set in NYC, ""Upstream"" dives into the lives of three New Yorkers chasing something so similar. But what’s getting in their way?

Process
Our plan with the movie is something like this:
- Collaborate with other industry professionals who are creative and technical. We want to play!
- Finalise the ideal equipment and locations.
- Film in January 2016
- Distribute through both 3D and 2D Film Festivals around the world! Who knows we may find ourselves at Cannes or Oscars or both. 


Obstacles

Money! We are a group of talented artists with great training to back us up. For years we have harboured dreams about making great art and putting ourselves out there for the industry to see us and know us. We need resources that we have budgeted for and with your help we can make it happen.




Other ways you can help
- Be a part of the crew! If you think you have something to offer or would like to volunteer and be a part of this amazingly ambitious experience then send us your resume! We'd love that and we'll certainly be in touch!
- Make a cellphone video answering the question: ""What's the most difficult thing about love?"", Share it with us and we'll share your voice with our fanbase.
- Just share our campaign and help us raise funds to make this amazing piece of art come to life!

We are collaborating with Green Planet Films (greenplanetfilms.org), founded in 2003 in Northern California, a non-profit distributor created to promote environmental education through the artistic power of film.  Green Planet Films connects environmental filmmakers documenting the relationship between nature and humanity for an evolving global movement seeking greater knowledge about the natural world we inhabit and depend upon.The Backdrop - COP-21 (Conference of Parties)The conference objective is to achieve a universal agreement on climate, from all the nations of the world. This campaign will raise the funds to film inside of COP-21 in Paris this year, an effort to reveal the elephant in the room.  The footage will be crafted into a documentary that lays out in plain, understandable terms the tug of war between nations and  governments and economic forces and 'civil society '(the people). 
Our future is being bartered for short term economic gain.  But the consequences are already lapping at our doorstep with a real an present danger of the collapse of civilization by mid-century.  Governments know of this, but must downplay their knowledge because of that elephant in the room.  This is both shocking and enraging.  How could we as a species be so selfish and blind?

<p><b>REMIND ME AGAIN...WHAT IS <i>PRECIOUS CARGO</i>?</b><br/>
The New York private school culture is unique, to say the least. Having grown up in that culture, Lauren Singerman and Sasha Kaye have a lot of affection for it, and they also see its comedic potential. <i>Precious Cargo</i> is a comedy loosely based on their experience entering that world from a different angle - as the women hired to guarantee kids' acceptance into the coveted halls of the fanciest schools in NYC. All while doing their best to manage the ups and downs of their own chaotic lives.</p>
<p>We funded production through the generous donations of friends and family. These contributions allowed us to hire a top-notch director of photography and sound recordist, and to pay for the type of equipment we needed in order to produce a beautiful product. We had a cast of forty actors and a crew of twenty. We shot season one of <i>Precious Cargo</i> this past July, in various locations throughout Manhattan, Queens, and Quogue.<br/>
<br/>
<b>WHY DO YOU GUYS NEED MORE MONEY?</b><br/>
We are launching our second fundraising campaign to raise money for post-production, which has already begun. Post-production is the vital step in determining the quality of the final product - it's important to work with people who will do justice to the remarkable work of the writer, actors, DP, director, and the entire crew. We have hired a fantastic editor, Nathan Allen, and an excellent composer, Adam Lindquist. These two fellas are in the process of editing and composing for us, and the material looks and sounds fantastic so far.

All while doing their best to manage the ups and downs of their own chaotic lives.
We funded production through the generous donations of friends and family. These contributions allowed us to hire a top-notch director of photography and sound recordist, and to pay for the type of equipment we needed in order to produce a beautiful product. We had a cast of forty actors and a crew of twenty. We shot season one of Precious Cargo this past July, in various locations throughout Manhattan, Queens, and Quogue.

WHY DO YOU GUYS NEED MORE MONEY?
We are launching our second fundraising campaign to raise money for post-production, which has already begun. Post-production is the vital step in determining the quality of the final product - it's important to work with people who will do justice to the remarkable work of the writer, actors, DP, director, and the entire crew. We have hired a fantastic editor, Nathan Allen, and an excellent composer, Adam Lindquist. These two fellas are in the process of editing and composing for us, and the material looks and sounds fantastic so far. Once their work is done, the episodes will be passed on to the color corrector and final audio mixer.We're so excited about how the footage turned out, and we'd love to have you on board to help see us through the next stage of the process! Your contributions will go towards:

Upbeat is a video production company that creates promotional content, often
to support theatrical film releases, but also for a variety of corporate
clients.  Tom Webb, Kieran Lefort
and I work together and we made a <a href=""http://bit.ly/watchbarry"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">short film</a> earlier this year which gave us
the bug for creating more short films. </p>
<p>A
few months ago we met Will Nash via Twitter who popped by to check out our
studio. We got chatting, and soon we were swapping links of our recent short
films. Will comes from a TV, film and commercial background, and it was fun to
see how our approaches to filmmaking were both similar yet different.</p>
<p>Will then revealed he had a short film script set in the 1940s, and before we knew it pre-production on SOMATIC had begun. 
Tom and Kieran developed the concept of the lab funding video above, for
which Kieran wrote the script and we then filmed in the Upbeat studio a week later.</p>
<p>We are making the most of the resources we have available, with industry professionals on board and filming with some of the best cinematic camera gear currently around, however to do the

</div></div>","Este es un proyecto Totalmente Independiente que explora las realidades Políticas y Sociales que se viven en Puerto Rico.

Mucho se habla hoy día sobre Puerto Rico. La quiebra económica, su estatus político, la ""migración masiva"" hacia los Estados Unidos y la creciente ola criminal son algunos de los titulares que diariamente vemos. La opinión pública pareciera tachar a los puertorriqueños como el peor ejemplo de auto-gobernanza en el territorio Estadounidense. Pero, ¿Realmente se auto-gobiernan los puertorriqueños?

Desde la invasión Estadounidense, pasando por el establecimiento del Estado Libre Asociado hasta nuestros días, ¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre? El Documental explora los diferentes factores que han empobrecido la calidad de vida de los puertorriqueños en la isla. Expone la situación política como ""ficha de tranque"" para cualquier intento de recuperación económica o social; a la vez que hace un llamado a la autogestión en todos los frentes posibles para combatir la crisis.

¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre? El Documental es un proyecto dirigido a los jóvenes que tiene como propósito crear conciencia del momento histórico que vivimos.Durante cinco años, utilizando las redes sociales como medio de contacto, con una cámara en mano y muchas dudas decidí comenzar esta travesía. ¡No ha sido fácil! Son largas horas de entrevista a través de casi todo Puerto Rico. Con ""nada"" como presupuesto (sin financiamiento de ningún tipo) y escaso equipo técnico he logrado filmar más de veinte (20) entrevistas con personalidades como: Siete Nueve, Ricardo Rosselló, Rafael Bernabe, Tego Calderón, Sonia Fritz, Dennis Mario, Tito Roman Rivera, Nelson Denis, Luis Diaz entre muchos otros para explorar el costo de la libertad.


Hacer un proyecto Totalmente Independiente nos limita en términos de equipo y presupuesto pero nos da la libertad de trabajar los temas con la fluidez y transparencia que necesitan ser abordados.

</p><p>Good day, </p>
<p>My name is Jeff-Roy Fahd, I am project manager for Solace foundation
(a NGO in Lebanon). We work on aid, distribution and sustainable development
projects. (House of Mouneh, Lebanese4refugees)</p>
<p>2 weeks ago I was escorting French journalists working for
Le Parisien to the Lebanese-Syrian border in order to visit a camp for a story
they were intended to write. The camp is situated in the middle of a big
agricultural field in a region called Hawsh Al Harimi in West Bekaa. When I first
met Jasem Al Ali, I got really touched by his story and the way he fled his
home after the siege of ISIS, settling in the East Bekaa region where he got
abused and fled again to the camp we visited in the West Bekaa. Jasem has 5
daughters and 2 small boys. The girls work in agriculture fields from time to
time, Ahmad and Mohamad are 9 and 11 years old thus cannot work. Jasem has a closed
vein in his head, his only job before fleeing his house was a driver and he couldn’t
find any job that suits his health in Lebanon yet. Yesterday, I visited Jasem
and the 14 member of his family living with him in the camp and spent the day
with them. My trip yesterday was a personal trip and was not a work related
trip; I got attached to Jasem and his family and decided to take the matter
into my own hands by trying and helping him wherever I can. I brought some food
supplies along with me yesterday and some clothes, but I asked his wife to
prepare a list of items they need by priority so I won’t get stuff they might
not need at the moment. The tent where Jasem is living is divided into 3 rooms,
1 room is for the kitchen, another is for the girls and the last room is a
sitting room where the boys sleep. What touched me the most is that the
coverings of the three rooms are mostly broken and the woods are shattered.
Whenever the rain will come pouring down there is no doubt that water will fill
their rooms. Jasem has a dept of over 12,000 USD for the owner of the camp
because ever since the United Nations decided to reduce the aid for the
registered refugees to 66 USD per FAMILY per month, Jasem and his family have
been borrowing money and working for free under the patronage of the person in
charge of the camp. I got attached to this family and this camp in particular
as I am visiting them once a week, this is mainly why I decided to go online
with this campaign in order to make a difference to Jasem and try and help him
as much as possible. Next week I am staying at their place for 3 days in order
to give them support and aid them. This family needs support before the winter,
they need clothing, heating machine, gas and a proper cover for their tent and
new wood; that is the main purpose of this campaign; Not to forget, I cannot
move them from the camp into an apartment because of the dept they have. The
funding will be distributed between covering the dept and getting ready for the
winter season. I will be buying a lot of covers and clothing, two big heaters
for each of the rooms. They preferred a heater that works on Gas because that
is the cheapest between the options they have. I will be changing the covers
and the wood that the tent is built with because these won’t last for another season;
they are literally broken and shattered. In case I don’t reach my goal, we won’t
be paying the dept they own to the landlord so we will simply fix the tent and
buy the supplies they need in order to get past the winter season without any
of them dying from cold or hunger. I think this is an important step in helping
refugees in Lebanon and in the world, to make them feel safe and secure, to let
them know that there are people from different religion and different
background that care about your condition and will offer to help. I took the
initiative because the winter is coming soon and the family will struggle to
live if we do not act now. The challenges I face at the moment will be real if
the winter season arrives before I get the funding, alone I will not be able to
change their covers and fix the wood. My biggest challenge is to raise money in
time in order to reshape their home so that they are covered for the winter
season that is coming fast. I have been working in aid and distribution for the
past 2 years, but I have never seen a situation like the situation of Jasem and
we connected well and I will never forget his words telling me  “ you are member of the family now “. I will
try my best to help them in case the campaign will not work but I could use a
hand so the help I will allocate would be bigger.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of people around the world that
cannot donate money but your help is a must. In today’s world millions of
people surf the web every day, sharing the story and calling for help will also
help us raise the money in time and save a family of 14. Do not forget to use
the Indiegogo tools.</p>
<p>Thank you a lot for your contribution. It will mean the
world to them.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Man Behind the Gloves:</b></h1>
<p>It’s one
thing to have a dream. It’s an entirely different thing to fulfill the dreams
of others. To help others attain goals that are beyond oneself is what it means
to believe in - and fight for - the transformative power of the dream.<br/>
<br/>
<span>Deshawn Stevenson is that person. Fighting for
both his dreams, and the dreams of others.<br/>
<br/>
Deshawn is a highly-ranked amateur MMA fighter
based in Greenville, NC. In a matter of three short years, he rose to a record
of 8-0, and now holds six MMA titles between two different weight classes
(middle and light-heavy weight) a USA National Champion title for
Thai-boxing. He dreams of going further, of becoming a UFC fighter, but he
knows he can’t do it alone.<br/>
<br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447087750/n34lpnrys5tuvv18n2qe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>After parting ways with his coach of four years
in early 2014, training has become difficult. He must now travel 70 miles (as
often as possible) to get to his current gym. These traveling expenses
along with gym membership and equipment costs are taking a toll on his
dream to be a professional fighter.<br/></p>
<br/>
Despite all of this, Deshawn is acutely aware
that his struggles pale in comparison to a lot of kids out there. Amazingly,
amid a full-time job at Starbucks and his own training schedule,
Deshawn finds time to be a children’s boxing coach, some of whom battle
with autism.<br/><br/>
Deshawn has a dream, and wants to fulfill the
dreams of others. And again, he can’t do it alone. With your help, Deshawn can
continue his training and take care of his training expenses:<div>
<ul>
<li>Travel </li>
<li>Gym Fees</li>
<li>Licensure fees</li>
<li>Fight preparation (Blood-work, nutrition, hotels ect.)</li>

</div></div>","The Man Behind the Gloves:
It’s one
thing to have a dream. It’s an entirely different thing to fulfill the dreams
of others. To help others attain goals that are beyond oneself is what it means
to believe in - and fight for - the transformative power of the dream.

Deshawn Stevenson is that person. Fighting for
both his dreams, and the dreams of others.

Deshawn is a highly-ranked amateur MMA fighter
based in Greenville, NC. In a matter of three short years, he rose to a record
of 8-0, and now holds six MMA titles between two different weight classes
(middle and light-heavy weight) a USA National Champion title for
Thai-boxing. He dreams of going further, of becoming a UFC fighter, but he
knows he can’t do it alone.

After parting ways with his coach of four years
in early 2014, training has become difficult. He must now travel 70 miles (as
often as possible) to get to his current gym. These traveling expenses
along with gym membership and equipment costs are taking a toll on his
dream to be a professional fighter.

Despite all of this, Deshawn is acutely aware
that his struggles pale in comparison to a lot of kids out there. Amazingly,
amid a full-time job at Starbucks and his own training schedule,
Deshawn finds time to be a children’s boxing coach, some of whom battle
with autism.
Deshawn has a dream, and wants to fulfill the
dreams of others. And again, he can’t do it alone. With your help, Deshawn can
continue his training and take care of his training expenses:

Travel 
Gym Fees
Licensure fees
Fight preparation (Blood-work, nutrition, hotels ect.)
Pads
Gloves
Fight/Althetic/Training Wear


 Along with helping him continue to mentor kids in need. 25% of
all funds raised will go towards purchasing equipment for Deshawn’’s
students. 



Dreams can’t happen alone. Help make one come
true, and help one dream become many.

<p>It's truly a pleasure to have your support with this campaign, you have no idea what it means to me and the cast to have you pledge whatever has been placed upon your hearts. </p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is David Rivers, and I'm a film maker. I've been working in film &amp; TV for over 7 years. I received my start after earning a scholarship in acting at one of the top 25 art schools in America ranked by the Hollywood reporter Savannah College Of Art and Design. After my first year I changed my major over to Film &amp; TV. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a film major, I've written, produced and directed many short films and wrote two feature screenplays. Not only have I been gifted to write and direct films, I've also written and directed many stage plays as well. After college I worked as the production manager at a local TV station where I created and produced its first original drama called Executives. Executives aired throughout coastal GA &amp; SC with an additional airing in Atlanta GA on People TV, the show is still in production. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Currently I'm passionate about creating powerful movies that will leave an everlasting impact on every viewer. My goal is to tell realistic stories that meet the viewer right where they are, and find an answer to their dilemmas. Above all, my top priority is to lead every viewer to Christ, and that's what my prayer is for the movie, The Answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This campaign isn't just any other campaign, we have you in mind, as well as every potential viewer. My overall goal with ""The Answer"" is to point someone to Christ through dramatic arts.   It's no secret that our world is suffering horribly from various types of crime like black on black crime, community violence, broken justice systems etc... leaving us asking what's the answer to these problems? Yes, the true and quick answer is Jesus, but truthfully many aren't coming to church, therefore they have to be reached through other medians. In order to do this, we desperately need your help! </p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Although I may have the vision, you have to the power to make it happen. You're not giving to just any other movie or project, you're giving to a movement, a ministry, you're helping to fight against spiritual warfare that's killing our young men and women, a warfare that's fighting to keep our justice system failing America. Your giving is paramount and this project can't go forward without your support.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>""The Answer"" debuted on New Year’s Eve, as part of a church service. It was presented as part movie, part stage play. After the production, many came crying and weeping wanting a better life. That was only at one location.  Could you imagine what could happen if and when this movie reaches the world and the impact it would have on the nations? You would be responsible for sending this message across the world across the globe and your giving is the vehicle driving this powerful movie around the world.  You play a huge part in bringing this movie to life!</p>

<p>As you can see above it takes a real team to make a great movie. The production that aired on New Year's Eve, I personally, shot, edited, color corrected and worked.  The whole crew on that production myself, and many others still loved it, but I know it could've been a lot better because I wasn't able to give my all to certain positions due to being pulled in many directions. </p>

Many of them are misdirected by many different influences.  What this movie will do is give an answer and show there's a better way to live and spark a change of a life. </p>

<div>Annabelle Johnson's peaceful day at the library is ruined when a man walks in with a gun.  Now suffering from PTSD and unable to function in the real world, Annabelle signs up for a new age virtual reality experiment meant to ""cure"" anxiety.  However, the simulation isn't what Annabelle expected, and she quickly finds herself trapped inside of it with no way out.  With only Caden (another participant) to help her, will Annabelle manage to find a way to exit the experiment?  Or will her anxiety get the better of her, keeping her trapped there forever?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>The Who</h3>
<div>We are a group of indie filmmakers from Boston and eastern North Carolina.  Melissa Bennett, our director, has been working in leadership roles since her high school days and has been teaching filmmaking since 2011.  Both our producer, Alison Rose, and our director of photography, Andrew Fewsmith, have won awards for their productions in the past.  And our production designer, Lizzie Lovett, has done both costume and set design work for numerous theatre productions in the Wilmington area for the past three years.</div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The When &amp; Where</h3>Principal photography for ""Butterflies"" will take place in March down in Eastern North Carolina.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>The Why</h3>""Butterflies"" is a film our director, Melissa Bennett, has been developing for over a year after going through a particularly awful series of panic attacks.  Born and raised in eastern North Carolina, Melissa left her teaching job to pursue her MFA in Film at Boston University.  ""Butterflies"" is both her thesis film and a journey.</div>
<div>
<p>Mental health is a topic that's often talked about but rarely understood.  For people dealing with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, etc., reaching out to people who don't understand can be difficult, as there's no common experience base to pull from.</p>
<p>This project stemmed from our director's own personal struggle with anxiety and depression.  In an effort to deal with a particularly bad string of panic attacks and also explain to friends and family what anxiety could be like for a person, she wrote the first draft of ""Butterflies"".  The nightmarish struggle Annabelle goes through during the course of the film can be likened to what someone might feel during a panic attack.</p>
<p>This film doesn't offer a magical answer to dealing with a problem like anxiety.  That's the irony in Annabelle's search - there IS no magic answer.  However, our hope is that this film will open a dialogue between people who suffer from mental health issues and people who don't.  These issues are more prevalent than you might think, and they're often hard to talk about.  But it's important for us to talk about them, and that's why we care so deeply about this film.</p>

</div></div>","The Plot
Annabelle Johnson's peaceful day at the library is ruined when a man walks in with a gun.  Now suffering from PTSD and unable to function in the real world, Annabelle signs up for a new age virtual reality experiment meant to ""cure"" anxiety.  However, the simulation isn't what Annabelle expected, and she quickly finds herself trapped inside of it with no way out.  With only Caden (another participant) to help her, will Annabelle manage to find a way to exit the experiment?  Or will her anxiety get the better of her, keeping her trapped there forever?


The Who
We are a group of indie filmmakers from Boston and eastern North Carolina.  Melissa Bennett, our director, has been working in leadership roles since her high school days and has been teaching filmmaking since 2011.  Both our producer, Alison Rose, and our director of photography, Andrew Fewsmith, have won awards for their productions in the past.  And our production designer, Lizzie Lovett, has done both costume and set design work for numerous theatre productions in the Wilmington area for the past three years.



The When & WherePrincipal photography for ""Butterflies"" will take place in March down in Eastern North Carolina.


The Why""Butterflies"" is a film our director, Melissa Bennett, has been developing for over a year after going through a particularly awful series of panic attacks.  Born and raised in eastern North Carolina, Melissa left her teaching job to pursue her MFA in Film at Boston University.  ""Butterflies"" is both her thesis film and a journey.

Mental health is a topic that's often talked about but rarely understood.  For people dealing with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, etc., reaching out to people who don't understand can be difficult, as there's no common experience base to pull from.
This project stemmed from our director's own personal struggle with anxiety and depression.  In an effort to deal with a particularly bad string of panic attacks and also explain to friends and family what anxiety could be like for a person, she wrote the first draft of ""Butterflies"".  The nightmarish struggle Annabelle goes through during the course of the film can be likened to what someone might feel during a panic attack.
This film doesn't offer a magical answer to dealing with a problem like anxiety.  That's the irony in Annabelle's search - there IS no magic answer.  However, our hope is that this film will open a dialogue between people who suffer from mental health issues and people who don't.  These issues are more prevalent than you might think, and they're often hard to talk about.  But it's important for us to talk about them, and that's why we care so deeply about this film.

   The What Your contributions will go towards a number of our production costs:  Paying for use of the locations (40%)
Housing, feeding, and transporting our cast and crew (25%)
Special rental equipment - such as big lights, generator, etc. (20%)
Production design - including costumes and special effects makeup (10%)
Safety - mats for falls, stunt coordinator for safe stunt work, special gloves for grip/electric crew, etc. (5%)



    The How While we do face a number of challenges in the creation of ""Butterflies"" - from night shoots to stunt work to limited time at some of the locations - we've assembled an incredibly talented and dedicated crew from both Boston and Eastern NC.  All of our crew comes with several productions under their belts, some of which have won awards.  
We've also hired a stunt coordinator to rehearse with our leads in order to ensure that all of the stunts are both safe and realistic.  
We know that we have our work cut out for us, but with a strong cast and crew behind this production, we're confident we can overcome all obstacles as they arise.

My name is Jocelyn Marquis, and I am an independent producer-director (B.A. Film Production, Studio Art; Hunter College) and self taught app developer* currently living in Brooklyn, NY. My goal is to produce an original new TV series and distribute it via mobile app. I have close to 25 years of experience in film, TV and music video production in capacities ranging from Director of Photography to sound mixing to post production. (You can check out my short films on YouTube - @CharlieSez007!) </p>
<p>Over my many years of working in this industry, I have seen producers (including myself,) work very hard and invest a lot of their time and money into projects that they were ultimately unable to get distribution for or monetize at any level. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>There are a lot of reasons any project succeeds or fails, but a large part of it points to the fact that the current indie film/TV business model is unsustainable.</b> I want to address this with an innovative strategy that will allow my production company to offer our show direct to consumers on the platforms primarily being used by contemporary audiences - i.e. mobile devices, on demand. This custom UI (user interface, for the noobs,) enables us to create a dynamic, interactive environment in which the audience can watch and engage directly with the program through vote in features, a chat room, video games based on our concepts, (just to name a few,) in a cohesive, digital environment. The future is here, and I want to play a part in building it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The goal for the app 1.0 release is to get the show out there to as many people as possible and demonstrate to a sponsor or investor that this production has the following it needs to be successful, while also promoting this as a viable distribution model, since it's still pretty novel, at least for an independent production company. The app needs to be really, really cool and speak to the level of quality that I want to bring to the entire series - and we are willing to put in the work and get it right.  </span></p>
<p>*props to stackoverflow.com + apptitude NOLA !!!</p> </div> <div> <h3>BABY STEPS.... Our 1.0 Release</h3> <p></p>
<p>So, technically we need $350K to do a pilot, get the app built (with all the juicy features), and of course since this is an independent project we have a pretty substantial allocation for marketing in the start up budget as well. But, as they say, <i>baby steps</i>. I dug deep to think of what I could do with what I have, and asked myself <i>what can I offer our fans and audience</i> <i><b>now</b> to get more people interested in the show</i>?  </p>
<p>Over the Summer I began collaborating with my friend John Coulter, a very talented artist and illustrator, on what was originally intended to be a modest app 1.0 project to market and promote the show. Then my overactive imagination took over (curses!) and our modest project became a full fledged interactive environment encompassing all 9 season one episodes - which required the creation of close to 70 independent storyboards, that John has to draw... by hand. </p>
<p>Most of the art work has been completed (you can preview a sample of it on the video as well as our website and here in our gallery,) and we would like to offer it through this campaign in order to raise funds because I really want to offer payment to my friend for his amazing contribution to this very early phase of this project. We also have a modest budget for promotional expenses when we release the 1.0 app. The whole point is to engage our audience, so promotion and marketing is going to be integral to getting us to the next step. </p>
<p>Although this is just the first baby step, it's the step that launches us into the world, which makes it the most awesome and exhilarating step of all! </p> </div> <div> <h3>Join us on this INCREDIBLE ADVENTURE!!</h3>
<div>
<p>There isn't much space out there for emerging new programming with unknown creative talent behind it in the world of commercial production. Which is why I'm going rogue and doing it this way. I cannot do this alone, though, we can't succeed without the help of friends like John, and the people who have been supportive, even if only with a kind word of encouragement. Producing and self distributing a whole new show is a BIG JOB, and starting a business is, as I have learned over the last few years trying to start the fire - a freaking emotional rollercoaster. But hitting the milestones is THE BIGGEST RUSH EVER and the incredible reward for all the hard work. Making it happen is what gets me out of bed in the morning. </p>
<p>By joining the campaign, you become a part of my team. You become a part of the unwavering enthusiasm and drive I bring to this project because you are saying you believe this can work and you that you want to see it happen. <b>I believe unconditionally that this will transform broadcasting history and be a game changer for independent producers everywhere. As a part of my team you are joining the incredible adventure we are taking, which in many regards will be no less than revolutionary.</b> I value your commitment to what we are doing, and I want to share the rush. As a member of this campaign, you are the FIRST to get the updates when we hit the milestones: the app 1.0 release, the production of our pilot, the season preview for all nine season one episodes!!! You have access to these updates (and all the behind the scenes pics and video) while the website is under construction and before PR even hits the internets. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How to <strike>SURVIVE</strike> THRIVE in Show Business</h3> <p>Creating the project is part of it, and we've got that covered - our app is almost done. In order to get past step one to step two is where things get tricky. We need a lot of people to download this app, and to make that happen, we need a lot of people to know it exists. My experience designing and selling apps as well as in film production has taught me that that creating a cool film/video project or a compelling interface only solves a small part of the problem. If you can't reach your intended audience, then there's really no point to writing the binary or making the show. Marketing is the other piece of the puzzle, the one most independent producers most readily overlook, and the main reason so few succeed.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How do you reach the audience? On the plus we're a horror themed show, with a pretty substantial, growing and global fanbase that's pretty easy to reach through the many dedicated resources that explicitly serve our genre. Knowing who and where your audience is solves A BIG PART of the problem. Our indiegogo campaign will hopefully help us generate some funds to help us promote it!    </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't support the campaign and make a contribution, but are still down with this and want to help out, the biggest impact you can make would be to go to our app demo video on youtube, <b>like it and post a comment </b>saying that you are into it and that you look forward to the show! And join us on social media for updates. I would REALLY appreciate it! THANK YOU! </p>

There isn't much space out there for emerging new programming with unknown creative talent behind it in the world of commercial production. Which is why I'm going rogue and doing it this way. I cannot do this alone, though, we can't succeed without the help of friends like John, and the people who have been supportive, even if only with a kind word of encouragement. Producing and self distributing a whole new show is a BIG JOB, and starting a business is, as I have learned over the last few years trying to start the fire - a freaking emotional rollercoaster. But hitting the milestones is THE BIGGEST RUSH EVER and the incredible reward for all the hard work. Making it happen is what gets me out of bed in the morning. 
By joining the campaign, you become a part of my team. You become a part of the unwavering enthusiasm and drive I bring to this project because you are saying you believe this can work and you that you want to see it happen. I believe unconditionally that this will transform broadcasting history and be a game changer for independent producers everywhere. As a part of my team you are joining the incredible adventure we are taking, which in many regards will be no less than revolutionary. I value your commitment to what we are doing, and I want to share the rush. As a member of this campaign, you are the FIRST to get the updates when we hit the milestones: the app 1.0 release, the production of our pilot, the season preview for all nine season one episodes!!! You have access to these updates (and all the behind the scenes pics and video) while the website is under construction and before PR even hits the internets.  

    How to SURVIVE THRIVE in Show Business Creating the project is part of it, and we've got that covered - our app is almost done. In order to get past step one to step two is where things get tricky. We need a lot of people to download this app, and to make that happen, we need a lot of people to know it exists. My experience designing and selling apps as well as in film production has taught me that that creating a cool film/video project or a compelling interface only solves a small part of the problem. If you can't reach your intended audience, then there's really no point to writing the binary or making the show. Marketing is the other piece of the puzzle, the one most independent producers most readily overlook, and the main reason so few succeed.
How do you reach the audience? On the plus we're a horror themed show, with a pretty substantial, growing and global fanbase that's pretty easy to reach through the many dedicated resources that explicitly serve our genre. Knowing who and where your audience is solves A BIG PART of the problem. Our indiegogo campaign will hopefully help us generate some funds to help us promote it!       Other Ways You Can Help If you can't support the campaign and make a contribution, but are still down with this and want to help out, the biggest impact you can make would be to go to our app demo video on youtube, like it and post a comment saying that you are into it and that you look forward to the show! And join us on social media for updates. I would REALLY appreciate it! THANK YOU!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

You probably know Nikola Tesla as one of the 19th century's greatest inventors whose work essentially ushered in the modern technological age. Radar, radio, X rays, and alternating current are just a few of the technologies based on his groundbreaking ideas.
What you might not know is that Tesla's interests extended beyond pure physical science into far more dangerous and ancient areas of research.
THE LEGEND
Our short film will tell the secret story of young Nikola Tesla, the Victorian era's first high-tech ghost hunter. 
Using his arsenal of steampunk inspired electric weapons and gadgets, Nikola fights to protect his unsuspecting girlfriend, Helena, against demonic forces that have just wiped out her family and are hell-bent on killing her as well.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Hello, we are Little Betty Films, a third year film and television production company at the university of Lincoln. We have a creative background in film and as our final year project we are making a short film. </h3>
<p>Our short film 'January' follows the issues of loneliness and the search for companionship amongst older people. The film follows June, a retired widow that needs to be brought out of her shell after the loss of her husband. Ernest, a quirky old man seeks to take June on a date she won't forget, and change her perspective on her future. </p>
<p>Contributors towards this film will help immensely, not only from a stylistic point of view, as we can get a realistic look, but also being able to provide a comfortable and relaxed environment for the actors, as they are older. We hope to enter the film into festivals and so contributors money will help towards providing us with the opportunity to do so. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The minimum amount of money we are looking for for this project is £400. We aim for filming to take place within 5 days so we have done a break down for this. </p>
<p>This will go towards:</p>
<p>Petrol/train fair - £200. For actors and crew to drive to the locations for filming. If the actors do not drive we will need to pay for their train fair as we are not paying them directly. </p>
<p>Food for our actors - as we are not paying the actors for their time we will need to keep them fed and watered! -£30 -40 for the 5 days. </p>
<p>Clothes/costumes - £60 - we want to dress the actors, especially Ernest in quirky clothing as he is a quirky character. the film takes place over a few days so they will need to change outfits multiple times. We will shop for these at a charity shop to keep costs down. </p>
<p>Donation to the church - £20 - One of the scenes will be filmed in a church so we would like to give them a donation. </p>
<p>Other money will go towards the cost of buying DVD's for the end product so if contributors would like their name in the credits and a copy of the DVD we can afford to print them out individual copies.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all know an older person that has lost their partner  or been widowed as they get older and so our film seeks to raise the issue of loneliness after the death of a loved one, and that it is ok to move on and find love again, no matter how old you are. </p>
<p>We are extremely passionate about making this film a success and raising these very real issues for people to help them understand and help an older person they may know find companionship again.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we are filming in January/February we face the risk of the weather being too bad for us to film in, if we get the funding we need this should not be a rpoblem as we will reschedule filming and adapt the script so that it still works. We will also take out the right equipment as we will be filming outdoors.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot afford to contribute towards the film it would be really appreciated if you could share our campaign and spread the word about our film. We hope to get as many people aware of this project as possible! </p>

Peter
Sidwell is the brains behind Simply Good Food TV, having worked as a chef and
presenter on Britain’s Best Bakery. He knows how hard it is to make it in TV
and what goes into creating great recipes on TV. Peter teamed up with Rob
Steadman the resident geek to create this new app. Simply Good Food TV is the
app for foodies. Since the app was launched in May 2015 we have gained over
13,000 users who on average visit the app at least once a week. This growth in
continuing and we gain on average an additional 170 users a day. We
are launching this funding campaign so that we can generate further income to
develop the app and add it to TV's so it is available on the big screen as well
as tablet and mobile. The Simply Good Food TV team are all passionate foodies
who want to encourage more people to cook at home, with wonderful ingredients
from our foodie friends (online farmers market) and offer a platform for new
chefs to have a voice. 
There
is so much talent out there, we are offering the food equivalent of Netflix. We
are looking to create a minimum of 20% of the content on the app, giving the 20

Lew Carpenter was one of the most respected football minds of his era. Not only an NFL World Champion running back for Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers, he also mentored some of football's greatest names during his thirty year NFL coaching career.When Lew became the 18th NFL player 
to be diagnosed with CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) a 
degenerative neurocognitive disorder that can cause episodes of rage, 
social withdrawal, and other unusual behaviors, his family was stunned. 


They had believed that Boston University’s brain bank needed Lew's brain as a control subject for a new study on concussions in former NFL players. The truth - that Lew was an advanced case of an allegedly ""new"" disease - set in motion a four-year investigation into America's favorite spectator sport by Lew's youngest daughter. ""A tale that needed to be told""

At the urging of her friend and producer, Sara Dee, they embarked on a road trip to uncover the truth.

<h3>Help Me Share a Film on the Inspiring Life + Legacy of New Orleans' Last Known Tuskegee Airman, Calvin George Moret</h3>
<p>My name is Amy Serrano and I am a Writer and Award-Winning filmmaker born in Havana, raised in Miami, and now based in the Greater New Orleans area. In the last 20 years of my life, I've worked on many important films around the world that have contributed to a deeper understanding of urgent social issues and human rights.  I've learned so much from the people I've interviewed and spent time with, the places I've been to that have imprinted themselves within, and the things that I've witnessed that have forever impacted me.</p>
<p><i><strong>By strategically combining the creative visual arts with advocacy, I've even used these films and experiences to positively impact Foreign Policy.</strong></i></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478838960/r5jfgho2wodkgtbuw1hl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Since early 2013, I've experienced the grace to be working on the documentary ""<strong><i>Airman</i></strong> "" a film based on the life of New Orleans' last known Tuskegee Airman, <strong>Dr. Calvin George Moret</strong>.  Through my time with <strong>Dr. Moret</strong>, I've gained a deeper, first person understanding of ideas and concepts about Race in America; where we were, where we've recently been, and the places to which we may yet aspire.</p>
<h2>About the Film, ""Airman""</h2>
<p><strong><i>The first part of documenting this film spanned the last 32 months of  Dr. Moret’s life.</i></strong></p>
<p>This involved a series of documented, exclusive interviews that took place at his home where we intimately discussed private and public aspects of <strong>Dr. Moret</strong>’s inspiring life.  During this time, we also obtained exclusive footage from following <strong>Dr. Moret </strong>on the road as he gave talks on what it meant to be a <strong>Tuskegee Airman</strong>, their legacy, and present day implications.   During these 32 months, we also attended and documented <strong>Dr. Moret</strong> at events related to this experience including a groundbreaking event with other surviving <strong>Tuskegee Airmen</strong> to commemorate the opening of a new exhibit at the now famous <strong>Moton Field </strong>in <strong>Tuskegee, Alabama,</strong> the historic site of the <strong>Tuskegee Airmen</strong> experience.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478840637/yshpjxmwnqajuam4d9px.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>      [that is Dr. Moret in the front row, right in the center]</p>
<p><strong><i>The second part of documenting the film involves interviews that take place after the passing of Dr. Moret and in reflection of the meaning of his life, the role he and the Airmen played in history-making social change, and using Dr. Moret’s extraordinary life as an example of a legacy that survives his time on earth.  </i></strong></p>
<p>These involve the reflection of others whose lives have intersected the life of <strong>Dr. Moret</strong>.  In particular, multiple events involve the <strong>New Orleans Golden Eagles </strong>the local chapter of the <strong>Black</strong> <strong>Pilots of America </strong>who--as the film will reveal--represent the modern day professional descendants of the legacy not only of the history making <strong>Tuskegee Airmen</strong>, they also represent a generation of young, black aviators who embody the spirit of <strong>Calvin G. Moret</strong> as they “<i>pass on</i>” lessons, stories, and opportunities to youth in their own communities.</p>
<p>In summary, because while he was with us, <strong>Dr. Moret</strong> felt so strong a call to tell the stories of the <strong>Airmen</strong>’s experiences, the talks at his home and on the road will serve as a springboard from which to tell a much deeper story.  From <strong>Dr. Moret</strong>’s point of view and ideals, we will trace the valiant history surrounding an exceptional group of men who risked their lives overseas fighting one war, while returning to battle another unjust one here at home. Their unfortunate struggles in the segregated <strong>South</strong> predated and were at the forefront of much of the public aspect of the civil rights movement. Their uncompromising valor paved the way to integration during an episode in history that never should have been, yet regrettably <i>was</i>.  But from this past, we will arrive at the present and learn how <strong>Dr. Moret</strong>’s life and ideals may play a much larger role <i>today.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>As in Independent Filmmaker, I need your help to make all of this possible. I need your help to use the </strong></i><strong><i>great potential that exists within great stories combined with powerful images and ideas to move people to reflect upon and improve our society.   </i></strong></p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>With your help, you become a collaborator in bringing the experiences that forged <strong>Dr. Moret's</strong> extraordinary life to a greater audience so that through film screenings, interactive community gatherings, and other forms of outreach, education, and engagement, all of us may gain a deeper understanding of who we are, how to better challenge assumptions and overcome obstacles, how we should treat each other, and most importantly, how we may come together and evolve.   Side by side.   Hand in hand.   <i>Together.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Receive for Collaborating</h3>
<p>Up until now, Siren Films has funded the first 3 years  of this project. To continue and finish the film, a small film crew and I will need to travel to complete out of town interviews in locations including Arkansas, California, Alabama and Mississippi.  But the most time sensitive trip involves interviewing <strong>Roscoe Draper</strong>, the last surviving Flight Instructor from Tuskegee who at 97 lives in Pennsylvania.  After completing these interviews, we will need to digitize and transfer nearly 100 hours of footage from our time with<strong> Dr. Moret </strong>as well as archival material on loan to us by the <strong>Moret</strong> family. <strong>We need to raise $24,725 to meet our goal.</strong>  This figure includes the IndieGoGo platform and credit card fees.</p>
<p><strong>This is how we plan to use the needed funds:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478849413/xpvs0gjspulnvemdx4e7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once we complete these objectives, we can proceed to edit a film trailer. From past experience, with a film trailer in hand to use as a demo, we can secure finishing funds for post-production and distribution via grants, corporate sponsorship, fundraising events, and other donors. </p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to have the film completed by November 11, 2017</strong> [<strong>Veterans Day</strong>].</p>
<p>As a thank you for collaborating with us, we've put together many creative and exciting Perks including recognition to you as a Collaborator, experiences including General Admission or VIP tickets to the film's Red Carpet Premiere and/or the Pre-Premiere VIP Party; gifts including copies of the First Edition of the soon to be published book of poems written by Dr. Moret <i>Ode to Life</i>, or copies of <i>Ode to Youth</i> a Limited Edition full color, 8x11 photo book of Dr. Moret's historic flight on a 1941 Stearman PT-17 set to one of his poems.  There are also copies of the film's DVD, autographed collectible film posters, and much more.  Check out the photos below for a Peek!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks + Challenges</h3>
<p>Though I have successfully brought a number of independent films to fruition, every project is different and the risk and challenge of any compelling story is that if funds are not raised in a timely manner, it will take much longer for that story to be told.  Due to  these challenges, some stories even get put on hold.</p>
<p>I made a promise to <strong>Dr. Moret</strong> and am deeply committed to telling his story, but with so many elders that play a role in it--and with current events necessitating inspiring and illuminating perspectives--<u>time is of great concern to me</u>.  So time and funding are the greatest challenges and with this the risk of others not being in the same room with us when we finally screen the film :(</p>
<p><strong>This haunts me, but today it also compels me to reach out to you for collaboration.  </strong></p>
<p><i>This is also a heartfelt invitation for to you to share this campaign with others.  </i></p>

The second part of documenting the film involves interviews that take place after the passing of Dr. Moret and in reflection of the meaning of his life, the role he and the Airmen played in history-making social change, and using Dr. Moret’s extraordinary life as an example of a legacy that survives his time on earth.  
These involve the reflection of others whose lives have intersected the life of Dr. Moret.  In particular, multiple events involve the New Orleans Golden Eagles the local chapter of the Black Pilots of America who--as the film will reveal--represent the modern day professional descendants of the legacy not only of the history making Tuskegee Airmen, they also represent a generation of young, black aviators who embody the spirit of Calvin G. Moret as they “pass on” lessons, stories, and opportunities to youth in their own communities.
In summary, because while he was with us, Dr. Moret felt so strong a call to tell the stories of the Airmen’s experiences, the talks at his home and on the road will serve as a springboard from which to tell a much deeper story.  From Dr. Moret’s point of view and ideals, we will trace the valiant history surrounding an exceptional group of men who risked their lives overseas fighting one war, while returning to battle another unjust one here at home. Their unfortunate struggles in the segregated South predated and were at the forefront of much of the public aspect of the civil rights movement. Their uncompromising valor paved the way to integration during an episode in history that never should have been, yet regrettably was.  But from this past, we will arrive at the present and learn how Dr. Moret’s life and ideals may play a much larger role today.
As in Independent Filmmaker, I need your help to make all of this possible. I need your help to use the great potential that exists within great stories combined with powerful images and ideas to move people to reflect upon and improve our society.   
The Impact
With your help, you become a collaborator in bringing the experiences that forged Dr. Moret's extraordinary life to a greater audience so that through film screenings, interactive community gatherings, and other forms of outreach, education, and engagement, all of us may gain a deeper understanding of who we are, how to better challenge assumptions and overcome obstacles, how we should treat each other, and most importantly, how we may come together and evolve.   Side by side.   Hand in hand.   Together.

What We Need and What You Receive for Collaborating
Up until now, Siren Films has funded the first 3 years  of this project. To continue and finish the film, a small film crew and I will need to travel to complete out of town interviews in locations including Arkansas, California, Alabama and Mississippi.  But the most time sensitive trip involves interviewing Roscoe Draper, the last surviving Flight Instructor from Tuskegee who at 97 lives in Pennsylvania.  After completing these interviews, we will need to digitize and transfer nearly 100 hours of footage from our time with Dr. Moret as well as archival material on loan to us by the Moret family. We need to raise $24,725 to meet our goal.  This figure includes the IndieGoGo platform and credit card fees.
This is how we plan to use the needed funds:

Once we complete these objectives, we can proceed to edit a film trailer. From past experience, with a film trailer in hand to use as a demo, we can secure finishing funds for post-production and distribution via grants, corporate sponsorship, fundraising events, and other donors. 
Our goal is to have the film completed by November 11, 2017 [Veterans Day].
As a thank you for collaborating with us, we've put together many creative and exciting Perks including recognition to you as a Collaborator, experiences including General Admission or VIP tickets to the film's Red Carpet Premiere and/or the Pre-Premiere VIP Party; gifts including copies of the First Edition of the soon to be published book of poems written by Dr. Moret Ode to Life, or copies of Ode to Youth a Limited Edition full color, 8x11 photo book of Dr. Moret's historic flight on a 1941 Stearman PT-17 set to one of his poems.  There are also copies of the film's DVD, autographed collectible film posters, and much more.  Check out the photos below for a Peek!

Risks + Challenges
Though I have successfully brought a number of independent films to fruition, every project is different and the risk and challenge of any compelling story is that if funds are not raised in a timely manner, it will take much longer for that story to be told.  Due to  these challenges, some stories even get put on hold.
I made a promise to Dr. Moret and am deeply committed to telling his story, but with so many elders that play a role in it--and with current events necessitating inspiring and illuminating perspectives--time is of great concern to me.  So time and funding are the greatest challenges and with this the risk of others not being in the same room with us when we finally screen the film :(
This haunts me, but today it also compels me to reach out to you for collaboration.  
This is also a heartfelt invitation for to you to share this campaign with others.

<h3>HERE WE GO....</h3>
<ul><li>My name is Gary Ugarek, You may or may not have heard of me but since 2006 I have made 3 independent films, and have worked as both an extra and a crew member on various other projects, many IMDB does not list.<br/><br/>My first film started as Deadlands: The Rising... a low budget zombie project shot with a lot of heart, that ended up becoming this sleeper underground indie hit... in 2007, I directed Deadlands 2: Trapped, this film stemmed from my need to correct issues in Deadlands 1. This film gained a following as well due to it's nod to a few different horror films (Return of the Living Dead and Demons), Finally after a 4 year break, I took on a passion project of making an inner city urban tale focusing on the brutality of the Baltimore Drug trade. All in the Game starred many cast members who were part of the Barksdale drug clan from HBO's The Wire, and allowed us to bond and not only talk about the issue at hand but the brutality behind it.<br/> </li></ul>
<h2><strong>So What's Next????</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fast Forward... 5 years.... The Dead Will Walk Again...</p>
<p>For 5 years I hadn't had the drive to make another film... nothing was clicking with me besides the script for my 3rd Deadlands film, which is a very expensive project. having chased funding for so many years the prognosis was bleak, and if I did another project outside of that story I didn't want it to just be your average ho-hum zombie film.<br/><br/>My Next Zombie Film Project, yet untitled, will center around the events of societies' collapse. When Washington, DC became overrun and the White House evacuated, the President and His Wife became separated from their young daughter. Her and her security detail are on a Journey to the Northeast compound set as the designated go to spot, when James and Sarah run into trouble, both Alive and Dead, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This idea stemmed from surfing YouTube while eating lunch one day and coming across videos of Urban explorers combing through an abandon resort not 20 miles from my home in Pennsylvania. I thought, hmmm, this is an interesting location... why not reach out and see if I could secure it.</p>
<ul><li><p>After that i began thinking how do I make a story that works... my zombie films tend to be very one dimensional, and for the most part leave a lot to be desired, so I came up with the thought as mentioned above... the 1st Daughter is separated from her parents during the evacuation... missing the flights out, her and her SS body guard are on the road and have to survive the two most horrific elements of the new world, zombies and the bastards of society. This led me to think about the Denzel Washington film... Man on Fire</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li>If we can raise the funds... you will be helping us bring a zombie story that delves much deeper than some of your low budget indie fare, hopefully with characters you can be invested in and root for to make it through the atrocities they face. <br/> </li>
<li>I bet you're asking... well what about the title? Well, I haven't decided on a title as of yet, hence the working title ""Next Zombie Film Project"". I want to come up with something memorable, yet poignant. If a title hasn't be chosen by completion of filming, Maybe we can have a contest to name the film.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need (The search for money)</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>I sat crunching numbers quickly and I arrived at $30,000. This amount would allow us to at least compensate some key personnel needed, as well as provide the supplies required to make the production come to life.<ul><li>The money would be used for the following:<ul>
<li>Production insurance</li>
<li>Food for Cast &amp; crew</li>
<li>Make-Up Supplies</li>
<li>Equipment rental (Generators tents, Lighting etc)</li>
<li>Compensation for key personnel needed to make the project happen</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h2>PERKS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each individual who donates at least $1.00 - $100.00, will get their name in the films ending credits, while this is a common practice for all socially funded film projects, it is something we as indie filmmakers like to do, you helped us so we want to make sure you're recognized as such.<br/> </li>
<li>Each individual who donates $250 - $1000.00 will be credited as Associate producers, these credits appear in the front or end film credits.(Depending on Amount contributed)<br/> </li>
<li>Individuals donating $2,500 - $10,000 will be documented as Executive Producers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OK, so what if you do not reach your goal?</h3>
<ul><li>If we do not reach our goal, we use what funds we have generated to begin filming, and restart the campaign to make up the difference. I have used this practice on my 2 previous films (Deadlands 2 and All in the Game), If their is concern the project would never finish, that is not a concern I would have, as when I raised money for All in the Game we asked for$10,000, and only raised $1,700 and completed the film which was released in October 2011.<br/><br/>I know many other film campaigns promise T-shirts, hats or other trinkets for helping them out. I do not want to promise this because those items end up coming out of the raised funds, and for a project of this nature.... zombie related... make up eats a huge portion of the budget and every penny saved and used towards the production will be seen in the final product. Also, let's be honest, how often are you going to wear a hat or t-shirt about a zombie film. Every contributor is entitled to a DVD copy of the film upon completion.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Independent cinema is marred in a lot of red tape, particularly when it come to raising funding. Crowd sourcing, such as indie-go-go gives indie filmmakers the chance to bring original stories to the masses while the studio system continues to give to the film going public the same sequels and comic book re-hash year after year. Your contribution goes further than that, it also gives up and coming artists the chance to expand their exposure. While many indie projects do not received Theatrical distribution, they get exposure through film festival circuits. A Film of this nature would be widely submitted to horror convention based film festivals. In the United States alone over 50+ horror conventions take place coast to coast every year and they are always looking for new and original content to present to their guests.</p>
<ul>
<li>You contribution helps continue the independent cinema scene.<ul><li>It allows new talent to get their first attempt at exposure.<ul>
<li>One of my extras from Deadlands: The Rising, has a small be re-occurring role on MTV's Scream series.</li>
<li>The cast members of my third film were on the highly recognizable and critically acclaimed HBO show, The Wire. (many of these individuals I hope to have return for this project.</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Your contribution is not wasted money. When I green light a film project I see it through to the end, no matter if we make our goal or not. As noted above, my 2011 Feature All in the Game only received $1,700 in donations out of the requested $10,000.00. We completed the film which saw  a Wide DVD release as well as Redbox release in over 2000 Redbox outlets across the USA, not too mention OnDemand and a limited theatrical release.<br/> </li>
<li>Many indie filmmakers have the dream but have trouble seeing it through, I have the track record of three completed feature length projects, that have garnered a combined 11 awards, as well as theatrical, film festival and DVD distribution in the USA and Japan.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any project their are risks as well as Challenges... those being the most risky is an uncompleted project. While this has not happened with my productions in the past I do not expect it to be an issue with this project. Some risks can be talent availability, location availability, cost overrun</p>
<ul>
<li>Being part of the world of Indie Cinema it requires to to be creative in how you spend your money, schedule your shoot and meet the overall goal of completing the project. I recruit my talent and never make a promise I cannot keep. I deliver on exposure of the project, I work around their schedules because like you they are donating their time to the project, working for very minimal compensation, mostly gas and hotel money, or as I like to say... ""$5.00 and a bag of Cheetos""<br/> </li>
<li>Solving challenges during a film production is a team effort. That is why when presented with a challenge we have to think on our feet and come together to resolve an issue.<ul><li>One example, During the ending of Deadlands 2, when the two male survivors are stuck on the marquee, the main traffic on the road was so heavy it would constantly interrupt filming... it required us to get extremely creative with angles as well as dialog recording in order to complete the sequence, it took us two days to film that sequence due to the traffic issues, but in the end the scene plays as intended with the most effective angles available. Why... because the actors, cameramen, and myself (The Director) sat down and worked it out together. As a team.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone has extra money to throw around, but maybe you have items we can use...</p>
<ul>
<li>Tent, sleeping bags, camping gear (We are making a make shift survivor community to make it real through production design this would greatly help.</li>
<li>Food/Catering - Do you live in the Pocono Mountain region? Cast &amp; crew can get hungry so any donations regarding snacks or drinks are welcome.</li>
<li>Share the campaign... do you have a facebook or twitter network of friends? If so share and spread the word</li>
<li>Come to the set and help us make the movie (we will always need extras, Production assistants)</li>

<p><strong>The Real Page Turner is a true story. It's the story of a woman who has lived one full life and dares to start another.</strong></p>
<p>Hi everyone! I'm Page Cooper Anderson. I am the creator, writer, and the star of this impassioned, often funny, sometimes tragic story of my recent life. </p>
<p>I was compelled to share my journey because it is a reminder to us all that life is like a mountain, never smooth, nor a straight line to the top, but boy, is it worth the climb and oh, the view from every step we take. I want the audience to say, ""If this lady can do that; leave her job, friends, home and all that feels safe and secure, and just follow the road ahead of her, so can I!""</p>
<p>It's one thing to write a story. It is quite another to be supported by those around you, even strangers, so that the story can be told. You are my hero because you are here to make that happen. Gratitude and hugs. Without you, ""The Real Page Turner"" is just ink and sheets of paper. With you, the world is invited to consider taking the risk that scares them the most. The one they will be remembered for. </p>
<p>Here's what we need to make it happen:  TOTAL: <strong>$73,500</strong></p>
<p>We will be filming in New York City with the most fantastic and experienced crew for 12 full days.</p>
<p><i><strong>Each day of filming costs roughly 6% of the budget here's where the money goes</strong></i>:</p>

<p>Actors and their unions: ""Speak the speech, I pray you"" WS- Hamlet </p>
<p>All actors will be paid the SAG ultra low budget day rate.  </p>
<p>Actor fees are <strong>10%</strong> of this budget.</p>
<p>Crew: lights, camera, action! <strong> 55%</strong></p>
<p> This is our biggest expense and is a large umbrella of expenses:    It includes camera equipment, lighting equipment, audio recording/mixing, script supervisor, set design, costume design, props, hair and make up, production assistants and labor expenses for each department. </p>
<p>Post Production:  <strong>20%</strong> this is for Editing, Color Correcting, Sound mixing,   </p>
<p>Transportation:  <strong>5%</strong> percent of the budget - We are shooting one day on location in Pennsylvania!  </p>
<p>Insurance: lawsuits be gone! <strong>2%</strong> of budget</p>
<p>We are proud to say that we have product insurance handled by Truman Van Dyke Co. </p>
<p>Locations are <strong>3% </strong>of the budget</p>
<p>Locations and transportation: Can I use your house, restaurant, piece of sidewalk, for one day? I have to get 30 people there how?  </p>
<p>We found some authentic York restaurants, hair salons and apartments!</p>
<p><strong>5%</strong> of the budget Food: If I feed them well, they will come!</p>
<p>Feeding the cast and crew each day.</p>
<p>What will we do if we don't reach our goal? I have written 12 episodes. If I can only make one episode, then I will make one! I know it will entice people to want more! </p>
<p>What if something goes wrong? A lot will go wrong! Resilience is part of the equation and problem solving the other. I always say surround yourself with nutritious people that are smarter than you. And I have. With the help of said smarter people, I have assembled a brain trust of talented, brilliant movers and shakers in New York City. I had my Dorothy moment, when each one said yes and signed on. The rest is cake (and I will eat that, too!).</p>

</div></div>","The Real Page Turner is a true story. It's the story of a woman who has lived one full life and dares to start another.
Hi everyone! I'm Page Cooper Anderson. I am the creator, writer, and the star of this impassioned, often funny, sometimes tragic story of my recent life. 
I was compelled to share my journey because it is a reminder to us all that life is like a mountain, never smooth, nor a straight line to the top, but boy, is it worth the climb and oh, the view from every step we take. I want the audience to say, ""If this lady can do that; leave her job, friends, home and all that feels safe and secure, and just follow the road ahead of her, so can I!""
It's one thing to write a story. It is quite another to be supported by those around you, even strangers, so that the story can be told. You are my hero because you are here to make that happen. Gratitude and hugs. Without you, ""The Real Page Turner"" is just ink and sheets of paper. With you, the world is invited to consider taking the risk that scares them the most. The one they will be remembered for. 
Here's what we need to make it happen:  TOTAL: $73,500
We will be filming in New York City with the most fantastic and experienced crew for 12 full days.
Each day of filming costs roughly 6% of the budget here's where the money goes:

 
Actors and their unions: ""Speak the speech, I pray you"" WS- Hamlet 
All actors will be paid the SAG ultra low budget day rate.  
Actor fees are 10% of this budget.
Crew: lights, camera, action!  55%
 This is our biggest expense and is a large umbrella of expenses:    It includes camera equipment, lighting equipment, audio recording/mixing, script supervisor, set design, costume design, props, hair and make up, production assistants and labor expenses for each department. 
Post Production:  20% this is for Editing, Color Correcting, Sound mixing,   
Transportation:  5% percent of the budget - We are shooting one day on location in Pennsylvania!  
Insurance: lawsuits be gone! 2% of budget
We are proud to say that we have product insurance handled by Truman Van Dyke Co. 
Locations are 3% of the budget
Locations and transportation: Can I use your house, restaurant, piece of sidewalk, for one day? I have to get 30 people there how?  
We found some authentic York restaurants, hair salons and apartments!
5% of the budget Food: If I feed them well, they will come!
Feeding the cast and crew each day.
What will we do if we don't reach our goal? I have written 12 episodes. If I can only make one episode, then I will make one! I know it will entice people to want more! 
What if something goes wrong? A lot will go wrong! Resilience is part of the equation and problem solving the other. I always say surround yourself with nutritious people that are smarter than you. And I have. With the help of said smarter people, I have assembled a brain trust of talented, brilliant movers and shakers in New York City. I had my Dorothy moment, when each one said yes and signed on. The rest is cake (and I will eat that, too!).
Are you are starving artist? Ready money isn't always so ready. If you press the share button supplied by indiegogo with all your fb friends, just think what you will have done for this project! Many just don't bother. Dare to bother! Take meaningful action. The Wizard will grant you wishes ten fold, he will.
What We Need & What You Get - we have staffed a full crew!

The Impact
We believe this project will inspire people of all ages all over the world to fight for their dreams and live the life over the rainbow, no matter what stumbling blocks are set in their path.

<p><i>The Breathing Series</i> is the story of a teenage girl, Emma Thomas, and her journey as she combats the typical teenage angst of fitting in, falling in love, and discovering who she is while hiding a terrible secret. Emma conceals her bruises under a guise of perfection, not wanting anyone to know what awaits her when she arrives home each night. The affluent residents of Weslyn, Connecticut would rather not know what goes on behind closed doors, until they’re forced to see what’s happening right before their eyes. This is a powerful story of love, hope and sacrifice, which has connected with readers all over the world. This captivating series has sold well over a million copies worldwide.</p>
<h3>You're Our Reason</h3>
<p>When I wrote <i>Reason to Breathe, </i>the first book in <i>The Breathing Series</i>, it presented itself like a movie in my head. I was a spectator to the beautiful and emotional story, recording what I witnessed. So I always knew it was meant for film and that I needed to be a part of that process. This story was too important to me to just sell the rights to a studio.</p>
<p>I also wanted to honor my fans who have made this an international bestselling series by being certain the films stay true to the books. In order to do this, I needed to be a part of something unique, something that hadn’t been done before. I was presented with the idea of breaking the first novel up into three movie length episodes, and I instantly loved the idea!</p>
<p>Last summer, I was introduced to producer/director Frank Lotito (<i>Growing Up Smith</i>). It was exciting to speak with someone who was open-minded and shared the same creative vision for this story. I knew he was the perfect partner to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>I spent the fall rewriting the three scripts for <i>Reason to Breathe</i>, and Frank proposed that instead of releasing a set of three films for each book, we should guarantee that the audience sees the <i>entire </i>story by making it into a limited television series release made up of nine or ten movie-length episodes and present it to television networks. I automatically agreed, because of course, I want to make certain the entire story is told. This means Frank and I have more work to do.</p>
<p>We'll create a detailed proposal to present to the network executives. We'll convince them that this is a brilliant plan - a plan that will earn us creative control, so Frank and I can continue to oversee the entire project.  Maintaining creative control is immensely important to me. This story needs to be told just right, and I believe I need to be the screenwriter to tell it. I am so fortunate to be partnered with Frank Lotito, someone who is not only a producer who shares my creative vision, but a talented director as well. Together we will create what is called the <i>Director’s Bible</i>, composed of the scripts we’ve already written and the outlines of the remaining episodes. The budget and schedule will be created, and locations will be scouted. The <i>Director’s Bible</i> <strong>is</strong> the film series—the exact details describing how it will be executed. In order to perfect it, we need time, a team of talented industry professionals, and funding. And since the project needs to be picked up before a network will fund it, we are asking for your help.</p>
<p>Over the next month or so, Frank and I will be dedicated to this project. Our plan is to present it to the network executives this spring. I know we will receive a “yes” after they view this detailed plan, read the scripts and see just how passionate fans are about making this film series a reality. There isn’t any other answer except “yes”. So let’s make this happen! After all, you’re the reason I’m being given this opportunity. You allowed Emma’s story into your lives. And I am so grateful to you for trusting me with your hearts. Now I ask that you trust me once again, and you will <strong>see</strong> Emma’s story come to life.</p>

Emma conceals her bruises under a guise of perfection, not wanting anyone to know what awaits her when she arrives home each night. The affluent residents of Weslyn, Connecticut would rather not know what goes on behind closed doors, until they’re forced to see what’s happening right before their eyes. This is a powerful story of love, hope and sacrifice, which has connected with readers all over the world. This captivating series has sold well over a million copies worldwide.
You're Our Reason
When I wrote Reason to Breathe, the first book in The Breathing Series, it presented itself like a movie in my head. I was a spectator to the beautiful and emotional story, recording what I witnessed. So I always knew it was meant for film and that I needed to be a part of that process. This story was too important to me to just sell the rights to a studio.
I also wanted to honor my fans who have made this an international bestselling series by being certain the films stay true to the books. In order to do this, I needed to be a part of something unique, something that hadn’t been done before. I was presented with the idea of breaking the first novel up into three movie length episodes, and I instantly loved the idea!
Last summer, I was introduced to producer/director Frank Lotito (Growing Up Smith). It was exciting to speak with someone who was open-minded and shared the same creative vision for this story. I knew he was the perfect partner to make this vision a reality.
I spent the fall rewriting the three scripts for Reason to Breathe, and Frank proposed that instead of releasing a set of three films for each book, we should guarantee that the audience sees the entire story by making it into a limited television series release made up of nine or ten movie-length episodes and present it to television networks. I automatically agreed, because of course, I want to make certain the entire story is told. This means Frank and I have more work to do.
We'll create a detailed proposal to present to the network executives. We'll convince them that this is a brilliant plan - a plan that will earn us creative control, so Frank and I can continue to oversee the entire project.  Maintaining creative control is immensely important to me. This story needs to be told just right, and I believe I need to be the screenwriter to tell it. I am so fortunate to be partnered with Frank Lotito, someone who is not only a producer who shares my creative vision, but a talented director as well. Together we will create what is called the Director’s Bible, composed of the scripts we’ve already written and the outlines of the remaining episodes. The budget and schedule will be created, and locations will be scouted. The Director’s Bible is the film series—the exact details describing how it will be executed. In order to perfect it, we need time, a team of talented industry professionals, and funding. And since the project needs to be picked up before a network will fund it, we are asking for your help.
Over the next month or so, Frank and I will be dedicated to this project. Our plan is to present it to the network executives this spring. I know we will receive a “yes” after they view this detailed plan, read the scripts and see just how passionate fans are about making this film series a reality. There isn’t any other answer except “yes”. So let’s make this happen! After all, you’re the reason I’m being given this opportunity. You allowed Emma’s story into your lives. And I am so grateful to you for trusting me with your hearts. Now I ask that you trust me once again, and you will see Emma’s story come to life.

The town mascot is a balding eagle, as you can see :) We will have these logos on Gildan Unisex Heavy Cotton t-shirts for our extras to wear...<i>and </i>for our backers to snag! You'd be able to print choose which logo you would want - ""RINDIE!"" logo, ""RINDIE LIPONCOCK 16"" logo, ""BALDINGS EAGLES Hockey"" logo, or ""BALDINGS EAGLES"" logo.

<p>If we do not reach our goal, the money will just come out of my (Amelia Spitler's) own pocket. If we over exceed our goal, all the money goes to the project.

I'm so proud of the progress made so far, and I will continue until the movie is completely filmed, mixed, edited, and film festival ready.

The Importance of RINDIE!
A little bit VEEP mixed with NETWORK, RINDIE! deals with themes of female bosses, mother figures, hidden desires and hidden lesbianism.  As a lesbian, the writing of Rindie has been extremely personal and therapeutic in articulating my own struggles with my role as a woman and my desire to be a powerful leader. Bobby, the perpetual boyscout, is able to articulate his feelings concisely to Rindie (which threatens her). Marcia, the openly queer woman, is able to articulate her truth by her actions (which also threatens Rindie). Rindie is unable to do both. She is stuck, her ideals based upon women like Nancy Reagan and Phyllis Schlafly - who she copies their images, but is not like them deep inside. As we all do, Rindie struggles in searching for her real self, and makes the wrong choice at each turn.

We already have money backed to cover our complete goal of $4000 - through crowd raising, we are trying to meet the goal halfway. All money will go towards the artists who have donated their time and energy to Rindie!
PERKS, YOU SAY?!

As you see, we have logos for both Rindie and the town of Baldings! The town mascot is a balding eagle, as you can see :) We will have these logos on Gildan Unisex Heavy Cotton t-shirts for our extras to wear...and for our backers to snag! You'd be able to print choose which logo you would want - ""RINDIE!"" logo, ""RINDIE LIPONCOCK 16"" logo, ""BALDINGS EAGLES Hockey"" logo, or ""BALDINGS EAGLES"" logo. We will also have RINDIE PINS! and RINDIE STICKERS! with her ""RINDIE!"" logo. 
If we do not reach our goal, the money will just come out of my (Amelia Spitler's) own pocket. If we over exceed our goal, all the money goes to the project. That means more money can be used for my crew's breakfast and lunch, more money can be paid to my dedicated team and cast members, more money can be used on higher quality set dressings and merchandise. 
Risks & ChallengesI am a very dedicated young filmmaker who has spent the last nine months gestating Rindie. I'm so proud of the progress made so far, and I will continue until the movie is completely filmed, mixed, edited, and film festival ready. Filmmaking is my passion, and Rindie is a gift I'm so excited to show the world. Through all the challenges, I will push through with collaboration and guidance from my amazing team. I can not wait to bring Rindie Liponcock to you all.

</div></div>","Malacostraca is a psychological horror film with creature puppetry that will be created by FX artist Gabe Bartalos. Gabe has worked on films such as THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE PART 2, BRAIN DAMAGE, FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 6, LEPRECHAUN, GREMLINS 2, and Matthew Barney's CREMASTER CYCLE. 
                
                       -Gabe applying prosthetics to Matthew Barney-

Malacostraca is an exploration of the fragility of the human mind, the male ego, and of difficulties in communication. It will be a horrifically scary film full of universally relatable feelings and fears. It will have a tone of trapped dread and nature-based horror; think 'Possession' meets 'Picnic at Hanging Rock.'

Malacostraca will feature the talented actors Amber Bollinger and Charlie Pecoraro as a married couple going through extreme difficulties. The film is seen through the unreliable eyes of the husband who's losing his mind and ability to love... One day when, seemingly suddenly, his wife announces that she’s pregnant, his mind snaps... When the baby is born he doesn’t see it as being his, or even as being human. Instead he sees his baby as a hideous lobster-like creature...


    

Malacostraca will feature incredible practical creature puppets and special effects all supplied by Gabe Bartalos and his crew at Atlantic West Effects. 
FX LIST:


External embryonic sac.
Cable controlled translucent newborn creature puppet.
Silicone torso duplicate of Amber.
Small scale crawdad puppet for skin breakthrough.
Larger cable controlled creature toddler puppet.
Duplicate toddler puppet for stunt work.
Silicone severed fingers.

<h2>""Gentle Mother, Font of Mercy...""</h2>
<h2>
</h2>
<p>In the heat of battle, with wildfire raging, men dying, and the world seemingly collapsing around them, Sansa Stark and Sandor Clegane come together in what will become the defining moment of their relationship and shape each other's spiritual and emotional journeys ever afterward...</p>
<p>In his <i>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire</i> book series, George R.R. Martin created two incredibly rich (though divisive) characters and brought them together for one of the unlikeliest of relationships -- the gentle, naive, beautiful Sansa Stark, and the angry, disillusioned, disfigured Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane. Although both characters appear in HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" (based on <i>ASOIAF</i>), much of their dynamic was omitted, and their intense encounter during the Battle of Blackwater was <a href=""https://youtu.be/gGfx8sREz_Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">watered down considerably</a>. Well, Kate and Squid are here to remedy that!</p>
<p>Avid fans of <i>ASOIAF</i>, Sansa, Sandor, and ""SanSan"" (as the pairing is referred to in fandom), Kate and Squid have decided to adapt a book-accurate version of this scene to film, using a <a href=""https://m.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/23ysm7/spoilers_all_asoiaf_in_shakespeareanstyle_verse/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shakespearean verse written by blogger Nina Friel</a> in place of Martin's dialogue. <br/></p>
<p>(<i><b>NOTE:</b> We will actually be doing the original dialogue written by GRRM after all -- see the UPDATES section for more info!</i>)<br/></p>
<p>We've been a part of the ASOIAF fandom for a few years now, and we have had the pleasure of making many great friends in the SanSan community, including each other! Our common backgrounds in writing and filmmaking, mixed with our love of Sandor and Sansa, has led to one inevitable conclusion -- ""Bird Song""!</p>
<p>This project isn't just for us, though; it's for our fandom friends, it's for George R.R. Martin, and, above all, these fascinating characters themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Us?</h3>
<p>Well, why not? In addition to being relatively high-profile members of the online SanSan community -- Kate known for her analytical essays and memes, and Squid's fantastic fanfiction always keeping people on the edges of their seats -- both Kate (director, co-producer) and Squid (co-producer) are experienced filmmakers, having each written, directed, and produced successful (and award-winning) 
short films and features in the past. We both know how to churn out quality content with limited time and budget.<br/></p>
<p>We're not only confident in our own abilities 
but in each other, and we have a terrific team to support us and our 
vision!</p>
<p></p>

Reflecting the challenging theme, the team will break traditional theatre conventions, using movement, narrative and sound to examine the truth about trafficking and challenging public perceptions. We also have key workers involved in the anti trafficking organisations on hand as research consultants to ensure authenticity and sensitivity. The piece will be intimate yet courageous, sensitive yet exposing. Through work with community groups we will provide a platform for debate, delving into the depths of this underworld and asking what would the universe look like if we took away the veil that is covering the stark reality.</p><p>WHY?</p><p>Human trafficking is the fastest growing international crime and is now the second largest illegal trade in the world. In the UK, you are never further than a mile away from someone who has been trafficked. The Human Movement will investigate what it means to be trafficked, explore why it exists and ask who is responsible?</p><p>West Yorkshire Police is among the forces which refers the most suspected trafficking cases to the Home Office or National Crime Agency. Between April and June 2015, the most recent period covered by statistics, it provided 17 of the 126 referrals from across the police service. And between October 2014 and October 2015, the number of intelligence reports about suspected trafficking or modern slavery created by the force had risen by 158 per cent to a total of more than 600 over 12 months.</p><p><br/>THE PLAN<br/>This week we will begin a three week Research and Development period at theatre Delicatessen in Sheffield.  We will develop the piece through thorough research methods and interviews with key workers in anti trafficking organisations, then using a range of devising methods we will create The Human Movement. We will be holding workshops with victims of trafficking and key workers in the field to help inform the piece as well as to help us understand the intricacies of human trafficking and what victims go through to help us create an authentic theatre experience. We hope these workshops will empower those affected by trafficking and develop some key skills they need to recover.We will be holding a sharing of the piece on 15th September at Theatre Delicatessen and on 16th September at Bradford Playhouse.</p><p>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP<br/> Your contributions will be instrumental in helping us develop this important piece of work.</p><p>The total cost of this initial stage is £22, 869. We have been successful in receiving Grants For the Arts funding from Arts Council England of £9,000 and  have raised £3500 cash for the project, including personal investment. the support we are receiving in kind from arts organisations and businesses is £10,000, which represents a huge commitment from venues to develop this important piece of new work. The rest has to be raised by us and with your support we can do this!!</p><p>What will your pledge be spent on?</p><p>Running our workshops with those affected by trafficking and the key workers in anti trafficking organisations.<br/>    It is important that artists are paid properly for their work. You contribution will go towards the costs of paying artists, creatives and production team in line with Equity/TMA rates for the duration of the project.<br/>    Costumes and props<br/>    Costs of touring eg Van, petrol etc<br/>    Costs involved with the research stages</p><p><br/>    Marketing Costs<br/>    Printing Costs (Scripts, programmes, flyers, posters)</p><p>What you get?<br/>    We have a number of rewards as a thank you for pledging your support!<br/>    You will be a recognised supporter of a crucial piece of work and of our company.<br/>   Your donation will give you the satisfaction of knowing you have helped create a piece of theatre that raises awareness of human trafficking and gives the victims of trafficking a platform to be heard. One of the key problems with tackling trafficking is public awareness.</p><p><br/>WHO WE ARE<br/>Buglight Theatre are  committed to making accessible, high quality drama inspired by a range of genres, styles and techniques. At the heart of our work is an exploration of untold stories or well-known stories told in a unique and different way often with the human condition and what it means to be human in mind.</p><p> We create work through a unique creative process of research, devising, improvisation and experimentation. We work very collaboratively at all stages of development. The process empowers performers to create the work, using the collaborative skills of writers and dramaturgs, rather than the more traditional method of working, the other way round, of performers facilitating writers and directors to reach the end product.</p><p> Our  audiences are integral to our work and part of our creative process is to run workshops and engage with targeted groups to help inform our work and give our audiences a part in the creative process.<br/>Keeley Lane – Co-Artistic Director<br/>(Actor, Theatre &amp; Television Producer &amp; Co- Artistic Director of Buglight Theatre)<br/>Keeley is a professional actress since 2009 and co-founded Buglight Theatre in 2014.

Reflecting the challenging theme, the team will break traditional theatre conventions, using movement, narrative and sound to examine the truth about trafficking and challenging public perceptions. We also have key workers involved in the anti trafficking organisations on hand as research consultants to ensure authenticity and sensitivity. The piece will be intimate yet courageous, sensitive yet exposing. Through work with community groups we will provide a platform for debate, delving into the depths of this underworld and asking what would the universe look like if we took away the veil that is covering the stark reality.WHY?Human trafficking is the fastest growing international crime and is now the second largest illegal trade in the world. In the UK, you are never further than a mile away from someone who has been trafficked. The Human Movement will investigate what it means to be trafficked, explore why it exists and ask who is responsible?West Yorkshire Police is among the forces which refers the most suspected trafficking cases to the Home Office or National Crime Agency. Between April and June 2015, the most recent period covered by statistics, it provided 17 of the 126 referrals from across the police service. And between October 2014 and October 2015, the number of intelligence reports about suspected trafficking or modern slavery created by the force had risen by 158 per cent to a total of more than 600 over 12 months.THE PLANThis week we will begin a three week Research and Development period at theatre Delicatessen in Sheffield.  We will develop the piece through thorough research methods and interviews with key workers in anti trafficking organisations, then using a range of devising methods we will create The Human Movement. We will be holding workshops with victims of trafficking and key workers in the field to help inform the piece as well as to help us understand the intricacies of human trafficking and what victims go through to help us create an authentic theatre experience. We hope these workshops will empower those affected by trafficking and develop some key skills they need to recover.We will be holding a sharing of the piece on 15th September at Theatre Delicatessen and on 16th September at Bradford Playhouse.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP Your contributions will be instrumental in helping us develop this important piece of work.The total cost of this initial stage is £22, 869. We have been successful in receiving Grants For the Arts funding from Arts Council England of £9,000 and  have raised £3500 cash for the project, including personal investment. the support we are receiving in kind from arts organisations and businesses is £10,000, which represents a huge commitment from venues to develop this important piece of new work. The rest has to be raised by us and with your support we can do this!!What will your pledge be spent on?Running our workshops with those affected by trafficking and the key workers in anti trafficking organisations.    It is important that artists are paid properly for their work. You contribution will go towards the costs of paying artists, creatives and production team in line with Equity/TMA rates for the duration of the project.    Costumes and props    Costs of touring eg Van, petrol etc    Costs involved with the research stages    Marketing Costs    Printing Costs (Scripts, programmes, flyers, posters)What you get?    We have a number of rewards as a thank you for pledging your support!    You will be a recognised supporter of a crucial piece of work and of our company.   Your donation will give you the satisfaction of knowing you have helped create a piece of theatre that raises awareness of human trafficking and gives the victims of trafficking a platform to be heard. One of the key problems with tackling trafficking is public awareness.WHO WE AREBuglight Theatre are  committed to making accessible, high quality drama inspired by a range of genres, styles and techniques. At the heart of our work is an exploration of untold stories or well-known stories told in a unique and different way often with the human condition and what it means to be human in mind. We create work through a unique creative process of research, devising, improvisation and experimentation. We work very collaboratively at all stages of development. The process empowers performers to create the work, using the collaborative skills of writers and dramaturgs, rather than the more traditional method of working, the other way round, of performers facilitating writers and directors to reach the end product. Our  audiences are integral to our work and part of our creative process is to run workshops and engage with targeted groups to help inform our work and give our audiences a part in the creative process.Keeley Lane – Co-Artistic Director(Actor, Theatre & Television Producer & Co- Artistic Director of Buglight Theatre)Keeley is a professional actress since 2009 and co-founded Buglight Theatre in 2014.

In attempt to clean up the country's persistent crime problems that are usually drug induced, he announced a crackdown on drug lords and addicts, urging the population to turn them in or kill them.</p><p>A wave of horror swept across the nation when his mandate unleashed extr­­ajudicial killings and rampant murders; among casualties were many wrongly and gruesomely killed in the name of drug crimes. The act of culling has drawn diverse reactions from its citizens. Sentiments from all sectors of society are justifiable, thus making this a very complex social issue to undertake. Humanity is put to test, and moral compass are confronted and displaced.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT</strong></u></p><p>When news of the Philippines drug war splashes across tv news and social media, my sympathy was immediately drawn towards the drug addicts who were murdered in gruesome fashion. Many innocent lives that are not involved in any drug crimes were taken when criminals ride on the purge to commit murders arising from personal feuds or robberies; with victims conveniently disposed in similar murder patterns as the drug offenders.</p><p>A lot of emotions stirred within me because of my deep involvement in drug rehabilitation community where I have witnessed many life transformations. I had many burning questions pertaining to the methodology undertaken. What is the difference between a murderer and a drug pusher? How possibly can you stamp down criminality by advocating one against another?</p><p>My life was clearly interrupted when a disturbing photo of a mummified murder victim kept revisiting my thoughts.</p><p>Delving deeper into the situation, I was brought to realization my understanding of the tragedy was sketched from a first world country perspective where in my country, systems are already in place and untangled from symptoms of an underprivileged society.</p><p>The drug raid split the nation's sentiments into two spectrums - one rallied behind the oppressive measure, seeing this as first step towards nation progress, the other inclining towards human rights and calling halt for the motion. My moral values pendulum back and forth these diverse and strong views.</p><p>Purge is meant to illustrate dilemmas and conflicts of a developing world, which mirrors other similar social issues faced by countries in other parts of the world.  It exposes the struggles of a broken nation, working to rebuild its social fabric and chronicles the motion of the purge that rises like a tsunami, and in the midst of it – the casualties, the survivors, the debris.</p><p>It contains moments of sadness, struggles and injustice for communities especially the poor who are targeted; and glimpse of liberation, hope and illumination for communities and families of victims plagued by crime threats on daily basis.</p><p>At the heart of this film is a perpetual questioning: Are political and economic complexities substantial grounds to provide leeway for human rights violation? How can we put human rights in its appropriate place when both casualties are victims and assailants of each other?</p><p> </p><p><strong>TEAM</strong></p><p><strong>Director - Kwan Adelene</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474826582/dg3vh113o4knq2ficutr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p>Adelene is a Producer/ director based in Singapore with 12 years of media experience.

In attempt to clean up the country's persistent crime problems that are usually drug induced, he announced a crackdown on drug lords and addicts, urging the population to turn them in or kill them.A wave of horror swept across the nation when his mandate unleashed extr­­ajudicial killings and rampant murders; among casualties were many wrongly and gruesomely killed in the name of drug crimes. The act of culling has drawn diverse reactions from its citizens. Sentiments from all sectors of society are justifiable, thus making this a very complex social issue to undertake. Humanity is put to test, and moral compass are confronted and displaced. DIRECTOR'S STATEMENTWhen news of the Philippines drug war splashes across tv news and social media, my sympathy was immediately drawn towards the drug addicts who were murdered in gruesome fashion. Many innocent lives that are not involved in any drug crimes were taken when criminals ride on the purge to commit murders arising from personal feuds or robberies; with victims conveniently disposed in similar murder patterns as the drug offenders.A lot of emotions stirred within me because of my deep involvement in drug rehabilitation community where I have witnessed many life transformations. I had many burning questions pertaining to the methodology undertaken. What is the difference between a murderer and a drug pusher? How possibly can you stamp down criminality by advocating one against another?My life was clearly interrupted when a disturbing photo of a mummified murder victim kept revisiting my thoughts.Delving deeper into the situation, I was brought to realization my understanding of the tragedy was sketched from a first world country perspective where in my country, systems are already in place and untangled from symptoms of an underprivileged society.The drug raid split the nation's sentiments into two spectrums - one rallied behind the oppressive measure, seeing this as first step towards nation progress, the other inclining towards human rights and calling halt for the motion. My moral values pendulum back and forth these diverse and strong views.Purge is meant to illustrate dilemmas and conflicts of a developing world, which mirrors other similar social issues faced by countries in other parts of the world.  It exposes the struggles of a broken nation, working to rebuild its social fabric and chronicles the motion of the purge that rises like a tsunami, and in the midst of it – the casualties, the survivors, the debris.It contains moments of sadness, struggles and injustice for communities especially the poor who are targeted; and glimpse of liberation, hope and illumination for communities and families of victims plagued by crime threats on daily basis.At the heart of this film is a perpetual questioning: Are political and economic complexities substantial grounds to provide leeway for human rights violation? How can we put human rights in its appropriate place when both casualties are victims and assailants of each other? TEAMDirector - Kwan AdeleneAdelene is a Producer/ director based in Singapore with 12 years of media experience.

<p><strong>Question: </strong>What do you get when you combine gender parity, social justice, environmental sustainability and cannabis?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>A Puffragette™.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Puffragette™ [puff-ruh-jet]: </i></strong><i>noun </i>a woman (or man) working towards gender parity, social justice and environmental sustainability in the cannabis industry. Origin: Pot + Suffragette</p>
<h3>The Film</h3>
<p><a href=""http://MaryJanesFilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>MARY JANES: THE WOMEN OF WEED</strong></a> follows Puffragettes™ as they navigate the “budding” marijuana industry in the United States. Their combined experience with the medical, legal, technical, scientific and business aspects of cannabis paint a multidimensional portrait of the what it really takes to be “The Women of Weed”.</p>
<p>Along the way, we meet authors, lawyers, doctors, patients, Congresswomen, legalization advocates, parents, and teachers who demystify the legal marijuana industry. We’ll learn about the evolution of the <i>Cannabis Sativa</i> plant, its Schedule I drug status with the DEA, and its eventual legalization for medical use. We’ll discuss how the “War on Drugs” created new “Jim Crow laws”, and the parallels between women leading the way to overturn alcohol prohibition and ending marijuana prohibition. Finally, we’ll highlight female-led businesses that are instilling social responsibility into their foundations and the successes these garner. By the end, we hope female and male audiences become educated voters and empowered entrepreneurs in any industry they choose.</p>
<p>The film is directed and produced by multi-award-winning filmmaker Windy Borman, whose recent successes include: the 10-time award-winning documentary, THE EYES OF THAILAND, narrated by Ashley Judd; and THE BIG PICTURE: RETHINKING DYSLEXIA, which premiered at Sundance and on HBO.</p>
<h3>The Movement</h3>
<p>Colorado. Washington. Alaska. Oregon. D.C. The recreational use of marijuana is legal in all of them. A total of 25 states have legalized medical marijuana and up to 10 more are likely to legalize it 2016. Concurrently, legitimate, peer-reviewed scientific studies continue to announce the health benefits of cannabis for treating everything from epilepsy and cancer, to PTSD and anxiety.</p>
<p>Clearly we’re at a marijuana tipping point, and “The Women of Weed” could make marijuana legal nationwide, help reform the criminal justice system, and build gender equality into a billion-dollar industry. We call this the Puffragette™ Movement.</p>
<p>According to a recent <i>Marijuana Business Daily</i> study, women hold 36% of leadership positions across the marijuana industry. That’s the highest amount of gender parity in any industry in the United States. In fact, <i>Newsweek</i> predicts that marijuana could be the first billion-dollar industry not dominated by men.</p>
<p>DVA Productions will follow these Puffragettes™ through the highs and lows of the legal cannabis industry in the documentary, <strong>MARY JANES: THE WOMEN OF WEED</strong>.</p>

She moved to Colorado in 2014 and is thrilled to serve as the Founding Board Chair of Women in Film and Media Colorado (WIFMCO).</p>
<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>I’ve always been intrigued by social issues, especially gender equality, social justice, environmental protection, education and empowerment. When I moved to Colorado in 2014—the same year recreational use of marijuana became legal—and started meeting successful women in the weed business—I knew I was perfectly positioned to tell these female entrepreneurs’ stories and inspire domestic and global audiences about how gender parity, social justice and environmental sustainability lead to greater success for all.</p>
<h3>The Timeline</h3>
<p>We began filming <strong>MARY JANES: THE WOMEN OF WEED </strong>in February 2016 and Production is already 65% complete. We’ve filmed in Colorado, DC, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and California. Oregon, Washington and Alaska are next on our list to round out all the states where adult (aka “recreational”) use of marijuana is legal.</p>
<p>To date we’ve interviewed 36 Puffragettes™ and edited the above <strong>MARY JANES</strong> Teaser Video to build our audience as we go and help finance the rest of film Production. We plan to premiere <strong>MARY JANES: THE WOMEN OF WEED</strong> at film festivals in Spring 2017.</p>
<p>In order to complete principal photography this fall, we need your support.</p>
<h3><strong>The Crowd-Funding Goal </strong></h3>
<p>Our first Crowdfunding Goal is to raise $13,850. These funds will allow us to film for 3 days (one day each in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska), thus showcasing women in each state where adult use of marijuana is legal.</p>
<p><strong>Note: All donations are tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, Green Planet Films, a registered 501(c)3. </strong></p>
<p>The Crowd-Funding expenses break down as follows:</p>
<p>$13,850 Goal - $692.50 (5% Indiegogo fee) - $969.50 (7% Fiscal Sponsor Fee) - $3,188.00 (Perk Fulfillment) = $9,000 Film Budget ($3,000 per shoot day x 3 days).</p>
<p>Even if we don't meet our full Crowd-Funding Goal, we can still use your donations to film as much as we can, and everyone will receive their donation ""perk"", although the DVDs/Digital Downloads may be delayed until the release of the film.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We've put together some amazing donation perks including, DVDs/Digital Downloads of the film, Limited Edition Donors-Only ""Puffragette"" T-shirts, commemorative film posters, invitations to the film premiere--plus a chance to win a signed guitar by Willie Nelson!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You can’t talk about cannabis without including gender equality, social justice and environmental sustainability. Additionally, we’re at a critical point in the United States where we have the first female Presidential candidate from a major party, the Black Lives Matter movement, record-setting global temperatures for the second year in a row, and up to 10 states are voting on marijuana legalization in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>MARY JANES: THE WOMEN OF WEED</strong> synthesizes these four vital conversations and adds a perspective that has been left out of previous films about cannabis: Women's.</p>
<p>According to a recent <i>Marijuana Business Daily</i> study, women hold 36% of leadership positions across the marijuana industry. The national average is 22%, so cannabis has the highest amount of gender parity in any industry in the United States.</p>
<p>Secondly, women purchase over 50% of movie tickets, yet represent only 30% of Hollywood speaking roles. This is true for cannabis films, too.</p>
<p>Next, <i>High Times</i> reported that women account for 40% of annual cannabis users<strong>,</strong> according to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This means there were 13.1 million women in the United States who used cannabis in 2015. Women also drive 70-80% of all consumer purchases. This is a huge market share. </p>
<p>Finally, women are creating businesses that instill corporate responsibility into the foundation of the cannabis industry. Showing this side of the industry is a realistic counterpoint to the other media that have focused on the “stoner” image, vaults of cash, or scantily clad women as arm candy. </p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: </strong>Isn’t it time we had a cannabis film where women get to speak about their experience?</p>

Transformer Table is the smart adaptable table that always shrinks and fits anywhere – and grows whenever and as much as you need itIn our age, in the rush for space efficiency, apartments are only getting smaller – which means that everything else, including the furniture, needs to be proportional to the limited space that you have at home.

<h3>What is Pit Viper?</h3>
<p>Written and directed by Pittsburgh-based filmmaker Ian Altenbaugh, Pit Viper is a mystery/crime series that takes place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the surrounding region. The story follows Parker and Medea, and the violence that follows in the wake of their decisions.</p>
<p>While out hunting for scrap metal one day, our down-on-his-luck hero Parker stumbles upon a bloody crime scene. Instead of calling the authorities, Parker instead decides to take a silver ring off of a dead body and pawn it. However, he finds that not only does no one want to buy the ring, but he is now suspected of murdering someone with some dangerous friends. Further complicating matters, Parker's ex-girlfriend Medea, whom he still lives with and loves despite the feeling not being mutual, decides to frame him for stealing money from the local drug dealer.</p>
<p>The goal with Pit Viper is to create a story that is uniquely Western Pennsylvanian, while having a broad enough appeal for everyone to enjoy. A show that is to Pittsburgh what Fargo is to Minneapolis, The Wire was to Baltimore, or Breaking Bad was to Albuquerque.</p>
<p>We believe we have a unique and cool project which we'd love for you to be part of!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Does Your Money Go?</h3>
<p>To put it simply, the more money we can raise, the better our product will be, and the wider audience it will reach. It will also allow us to get Pit Viper out to the world quicker. Because, whether we meet our goal or not, Pit Viper is going to be finished and available to audiences everywhere. However, the more support we get, the more options we have in post-production, especially when it comes to music.</p>
<p>The breakdown of our fundraiser goes as follows:</p>
<p>- $750 for editing and color</p>
<p>- $900 for post-audio mix and score</p>
<p>- $350 for marketing, merchandise, and festival submissions.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Risks, Our Challenges, Our Story</h3>
<p>Pit Viper has been a year in the making. The creator of the series, Ian Altenbaugh spent several years developing the concept and much of 2015 writing the pilot. He also called in every favor and maxed out every credit card he had to get the project made.</p>
<p>While there are always risks with every project, the Pit Viper team believes strongly that they have a product that is smart, unique, and a lot of fun. While money was spent on equipment rentals, the cast and crew worked for free, on a holiday weekend no less, because they felt passionately about making something that represents the place they live.</p>
<p>The Pit Viper team asks that you share this crowdfunding campaign with your friends, family, and anyone you might think would be interested. We feel passionately about this project and if you enjoy the movie half as much as the cast and crew did making it, then you will be highly entertained.</p>

<h2>Why is this Campaign Important?</h2>
<p>The importance of this film is beyond measure. The Cape Verdean Community and it's Youth are in dire need of positive role models and influential stories about their culture. Even in 2017 someone can go outside and ask a random person ""what/where is Cape Verde?"" and 99% of folks will be clueless. Not only is this film important for Cape Verdean culture but its also influential in introducing Non-Cape Verdeans to our beautiful and one-of-a-kind culture.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Look of the Film</h2>
<p>Cabo Verde is one of the most unique and picturesque places in the world. One of the ten islands which make up Cabo Verde is Brava, known for its luscious landscapes and flora. The creative minds at 32CaboVerde.com captured some of the best footage ever of the island and we plan on working with them and capturing similar footage of the island of Praia for our film. Take a minute to check out the video below and welcome to Cabo Verde!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am an actress originally from South Africa who moved to the UK when I was 14yrs to study drama. I was lucky enough to get into The Brit School at that age, substituting 'normal' subjects for performance related subjects. I completed my four years there with distinctions all the way, followed by a three year degree at Dartington College of Arts with a first.</p>
<p>I have worked on stage and screen as well as devised and produced performance material for theatre and short films. I've also done a bit of professional singing and art... If I had to describe myself in one word, I would say, 'creative'. This is a tough industry but it's a calling. I cannot help but continue to make work that I hope audiences relate to.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £8,500 to just cover the basic costs over a three night shoot, pre and post production. This seems like an enormous figure but when you break it down, a piece of the pie branches out to many unfamiliar factors. A pie chart on our website gives an idea of the costs involved:</p>

<p>If the target is not reached, the funds will be saved for Lane until additional funding options can be realised. This film is going to be made, come what may.</p>

I am an actress originally from South Africa who moved to the UK when I was 14yrs to study drama. I was lucky enough to get into The Brit School at that age, substituting 'normal' subjects for performance related subjects. I completed my four years there with distinctions all the way, followed by a three year degree at Dartington College of Arts with a first.
I have worked on stage and screen as well as devised and produced performance material for theatre and short films. I've also done a bit of professional singing and art... If I had to describe myself in one word, I would say, 'creative'. This is a tough industry but it's a calling. I cannot help but continue to make work that I hope audiences relate to. This has always been my goal, to share a piece of humanity with others.
This campaign is important not only because it will be the first short film I've written, directed and produced, but because it deals with issues close to my heart and universal themes I know will be accessible to a very wide audience. The issue of stress attacks us all. For many, it impacts our health and I want to shed some awareness to the harm in the only way I know, through performance.
Set in a swimming pool, Lane has little dialogue and is very visual. This makes the film even more accessible because you lose the potential language barrier. Taking the broad theme of stress into a swimming pool context allows a very specific way to communicating the concept through the environment. Even for those who are not swimmers, I believe the psychological tension will be something they can relate to because the frame of the film oftens takes the point of view of the swimmer.
Given that this is quite an ambitious project for my first short film, many would run to the hills after conceiving the idea. Working in water is not only expensive for location and equipment, it can also be dangerous. To add, the experience of filming in water is not the common box many film makers tick. However, since writing the film in April, I have been so incredibly supported and encouraged by my film making colleagues and friends that I am determined to make this happen.
The target of £8,500 that we want to reach will cover only the barest of costs, and that includes many favours that I will, for many years, be indebted to. If we reach beyond our target, it means that not only are we doing things correctly and safely, but we will be able to pay crew - many of whom have agreed to work for expenses-only because of their belief. Beyond that are always additional unforeseen festival expenses once the film is complete. The target therefore, really does just cover our backs.

Written and directed by veteran Hollywood actor Nick Mancuso, star of countless movies and of the cult hit TV series Stingray in the mid 80s. Persefone's Tears will star some of Italy's best and brightest, established Hollywood stars, Serbia's top actors and collection of top cinematographers and editors.<br/>For the first time in history, Hollywood moves into the mountains of Southern Italy near the Aspromonte renowned for its mystery and antiquity.<br/>Starring American actor Nicholas Porcelli (Behaving Badly, Rising Alien) and Silvia Suvadova, John Savage, Nick Mancuso, Enzo de Liguoro, horror star Bill Moseley, Yancy Butler, Cinzia Costa, Lazar Rockwood, Italian movie star and winner of the Donatello Award, Antonella Ponziani, star of Fellinis Intervista, and many other renowned Films, and co directed by Oscar nominated American director Jonathan Heap, with Italian cinematographer Massimiliano Trevis (Titus Andronicus). Persefone's Tears is a comedy horror delight, a film like you have never seen. Music by Calabrian Guitarist ""Battente"" Francesco Loccisano.</p><h3>BASIC PLOT</h3><p>Nick Young, fading former Hollywood TV star decides to accept a role in a low budget horror film shooting in the land of his immigrant parents. Unable to get the role that would catapult him to the top of the Hollywood heap he grudgingly accepts a part portraying a French soldier in Napoleons army in his invasion of the Russia.<br/>His cadre is wiped out in the forests near Moscow and he survives only to enter an abandoned village populated by a coven of witches. In the meantime Nick begins to experience a series of hallucinated visions in which the ancient goddess Persefone appears to him in various guises including famed Slovakian actress Silvia Suvadova. Up for a major role back home with Martin Scorcese Nick undergoes a massive sea change, leaving behind his drug addicted past to reconnect to his personal significance and what is true and real and beautiful. All this while everything is falling apart all around him. He never gets the part that would catapult him to fame and fortune but instead finds the true love of discovering who he really is and why other people are important.</p><h3>IDEALS</h3><p>We are hoping to raise 25,000 US-Dollars on the first round with a final budget of 350,000 Euros which we hope to raise from private investors and government sources as well as Indiegogo.

</div>
<p><i>Black Girl’s Be Like </i>is
the girls’ side of the story. Very often we see a woman at the end of her
journey with no clue of how she got there. No one starts out broken, hard, and
difficult to love. Yes, even the most hardened woman started out as an innocent
girl. What happens to one as they ditch the innocence of girlhood and slip into
the woman they will become? <i>Black Girl’s
Be Like </i>is a coming of age tale of a girl at the cusp, with the limitless
potential that only a child could possess. Does she fall in line with the
others and become what her environment dictates? Or does she break out and
blaze a new trail? Ta’Sheena is every girl, in every school in a failing
district, in every urban community. You ever wonder who was the name behind the
statistic? What blurred out child’s face you see in the 5:00 news? This film
portrays what young women in such environments experience on a daily basis and
how innocence is constantly threatened. In the ongoing narrative of “the hood”
who is the heroine? </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div></div>
<p>In order to make <i>Black
Girl’s Be Like</i> a reality I need the proper funding. My past films have been
made with little to no budgets. It is my plan for this film to reach larger
audiences and that can’t be done without financial support. All the basics of
production will be covered; insurance, cast, crew, locations, catering, set
dec, props, etc. As well as post-production, which is a huge key in producing a
great finished product. I’m collaborating with an awesome crew that are great
in their perspective crafts. As an independent contractor myself I know how
important it is for our work to be valued and compensated. I would like to
translate the kind of professionalism I encounter working on network
television/films to my own set, which includes paying and feeding people.
Principle photography will be done in my hometown of Grand Rapids, MI, a town
that once benefited from a fruitful film incentive but has since lost. It is my
hope that my film, in some small way, can bring the love of filmmaking back to
the city. By employing local cast, talent, and vendors I hope to add a small
spike in the Grand Rapids economy. In short help fund my film because the story
needs to be told. Our girls need to know that there are other people like them
out there, and that the every day struggle they encounter isn’t singular. </p>
<p>Aside from the warm-fuzzy feeling you get for donating to a good cause here are some perks that come with giving:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>I worked for the Grand Rapids Public School District for 3
years fresh out of college, after first being a product of the district myself.
During my time there I worked as an after school teacher, instructing video
production, and as a Youth Advocate where I was given a case load of students
that I was responsible in helping matriculate through the school year. The kids
on the caseload were considered “at-risk” due to whatever guidelines and
criteria created by some person sitting in an office came up with. Due to their
parents income, and the area they lived in they could have ended up on my list.
The students I encountered changed my life. They inspired me, angered me, and
challenged me every single day. Although I would leave work exhausted I would
always leave feeling like a change was made, even though it may have been
small. Not only did I take away a piece of those students in my heart, but also
left with their stories and experiences. It angered me that the outside world
thought that these kids were bad or stupid, or unworthy in some sense. <i>Black Girl’s Be Like</i> is a story inspired
by the stories and lives of the students I encountered. Behind the tough
facades of each student I found a child that wanted to be accepted, understood,
and loved. I wanted to make this Film so people on the outside could get a
glimpse of what happens beyond the headlines. </p><div>

<h3>Who's asking?</h3>
<p>The peepSHOW team crew is designing and building this installation as a labor of love for the Market Street Prototyping Festival and the City of San Francisco. We have received some generous support—from MSPF, SF Planning, YBCA, David Baker Architects, BOK Modern, and Autodesk—but we are an independent team spending a tremendous amount of our personal time, energy, and money to realize this project.</p>
<p>We are hustling to gather support, cut costs, and streamline production. We are committed to making a beautiful, engaging, durable, and safe installation to spark curiosity and conversation and to brighten the Market Street corridor. For this, we need to raise enough funding to fully realize the project. <br/> </p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p><strong>peepSHOW 2.0</strong> is an immersive mirrored urban viewing station that focuses your gaze and thoughts onto concealed street scenes and creates a space for you as a Market Street pedestrian to contemplate your surroundings and connect with fellow citizens. Inspired by a nature viewing station, peepSHOW centers the act of observation in San Francisco's dense city context.</p>
<h3>Why are we building it?</h3>
<p>We had an amazing experience developing the original peepSHOW for the original Market Street Prototyping Festival last year. The Festival and the City invited us to return—bigger, better, sponsored, and incubated—for this year's event.<strong> peepSHOW 2.0</strong> is currently being developed in the Urban Prototyping Research Lab via a 6-month iterative R&amp;D program in collaboration with the Market Street Prototyping team, Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, Autodesk, and the residents of San Francisco. David Baker Architects has committed funds to the project and supported our efforts with flexible scheduling. BOK Modern is a generous fabrication partner, and Arup is providing critical structural engineering guidance.</p>
<h3>What needs to happen?</h3>
<p>As this entire process is experimental, the funding offered to us is minimal. We are pushing to make <strong>peepSHOW 2.0</strong> as engaging, beautiful, and impactful as possible. We need your help to bridge the funding gap! With your support, we can bring <strong>peepSHOW 2.0</strong> to Market Street for <i>up to two years</i> and help to shape the future of the city's main corridor.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the plan?</h3>
<p>We are seeking donations totaling $15,000 to subsidize the funding we have received from the Festival Incubation Program and from our role as an MSPF Design Captain, mentoring 10 first-time prototype projects to develop their vision for the Festival as well. We are looking forward to your contribution! Perks of gratitude range from a private dinner for two inside the peepSHOW, to the chance to have your name engraved on the <strong>peepSHOW</strong> for all to see, to a VIP invitation to our Fundraiser Party in September.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the impact?</h3>
<p><strong>peepSHOW 1.0</strong> was our first prototype: We worked hard to create the piece, designing and fabricating it in-house. For <strong>peepSHOW 2.0</strong>, we are upgrading the concept, construction materials, and design to withstand the elements and a high volume of participants. The new highly interactive<strong> peepSHOW 2.0</strong> will be installed in a plaza at Third and Market Streets in San Francisco. This location has the potential to reach 8,000 people every day, and will also support large gatherings, events, and performances. We are working hard to partner with creative and generous fabricators and engineers to bring <strong>peepSHOW</strong> to life as safely and economically as possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
<p>Please make a donation! All funds are a meaningful contribution to the <strong>peepSHOW</strong> project. They will be used resourcefully and appreciated greatly.  Plus, help us get the word out by sharing our campaign with friends, family, and colleagues!<br/><br/>This Indiegogo campaign is fiscally sponsored by Gray Area Foundation for the Arts.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is ICON?</h3>
<p><i><strong>ICON</strong></i> is the story of a team of three accomplished con-artists, separated for years after bad blood arose between them, who are brought back together for one more Big Score. Intrigues, twists and turns, double-and-triple-crosses abound... It may seem like a familiar plot line -- but what sets our film apart is our process, which we have dubbed <i><strong>""Living Film""</strong></i>. Our approach will provide a uniquely <strong>raw</strong>, <strong>visceral</strong>, <strong>exciting</strong> filmmaking <i>and</i> viewing experience.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional filmmaking, in which every moment is choreographed, rehearsed, and filmed numerous times (sometimes dozens of times) in order to capture the ""perfect "" moment, ICON is <strong>unscripted</strong> and <strong>unrehearsed</strong>. And while the outline of the story, and what needs to happen in order to fulfill it, is <strong>known by the Director</strong> (as well as the Director of Photography and camera operators), the <strong>actors</strong> have <strong>no foreknowledge of what's about to happen</strong>. They are existing <strong>truthfully</strong> in the moment, <strong>every moment</strong>. The actors will rehearse backstory together in order to better understand character and relationships, and to build shared experiences. But the scenes of the film itself will be happening <strong>live</strong>.</p>
<p>Similar approaches have been taken in unscripted films in the past, from Godard to Cassavetes to Christopher Guest to James Byrkit -- But <i><strong>Living Film</strong></i> again is <strong>different</strong>. For our actors, just as in life, there are <strong>no retakes</strong>. No second chances. No ""coverage"". No telling where it will all end up. We will shoot with two matching cameras, so we never miss a moment -- but what happens in front of the lens happens <strong>once and once only</strong>, raw and truthful. It's like a <i>LIVE MOVIE</i>.</p>
<p>We have assembled a team of <strong>accomplished storytellers</strong> both behind and in front of the camera. All of the players have extensive experience in dramatic improv, writing, acting and filmmaking. We feel confident and excited to bring this <strong>new form</strong> of storytelling to life</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need  </h3>
<ul><li>We are seeking $20,000 to cover customary expenses associated with creating a viable feature-length film. The creative team (Director, Actors, Director of Photography) are not expecting any direct compensation. We are doing this for the love of the process and the opportunity to create a unique cinematic artwork. But here's how your contributions will be distributed:</li></ul>
<ol style=""margin-left:40px;"">

</div></div>","What is ICON?
ICON is the story of a team of three accomplished con-artists, separated for years after bad blood arose between them, who are brought back together for one more Big Score. Intrigues, twists and turns, double-and-triple-crosses abound... It may seem like a familiar plot line -- but what sets our film apart is our process, which we have dubbed ""Living Film"". Our approach will provide a uniquely raw, visceral, exciting filmmaking and viewing experience.
Unlike traditional filmmaking, in which every moment is choreographed, rehearsed, and filmed numerous times (sometimes dozens of times) in order to capture the ""perfect "" moment, ICON is unscripted and unrehearsed. And while the outline of the story, and what needs to happen in order to fulfill it, is known by the Director (as well as the Director of Photography and camera operators), the actors have no foreknowledge of what's about to happen. They are existing truthfully in the moment, every moment. The actors will rehearse backstory together in order to better understand character and relationships, and to build shared experiences. But the scenes of the film itself will be happening live.
Similar approaches have been taken in unscripted films in the past, from Godard to Cassavetes to Christopher Guest to James Byrkit -- But Living Film again is different. For our actors, just as in life, there are no retakes. No second chances. No ""coverage"". No telling where it will all end up. We will shoot with two matching cameras, so we never miss a moment -- but what happens in front of the lens happens once and once only, raw and truthful. It's like a LIVE MOVIE.
We have assembled a team of accomplished storytellers both behind and in front of the camera. All of the players have extensive experience in dramatic improv, writing, acting and filmmaking. We feel confident and excited to bring this new form of storytelling to life

What We Need  
We are seeking $20,000 to cover customary expenses associated with creating a viable feature-length film. The creative team (Director, Actors, Director of Photography) are not expecting any direct compensation. We are doing this for the love of the process and the opportunity to create a unique cinematic artwork. But here's how your contributions will be distributed:

$5,000 goes to renting state-of-the-art camera equipment and cinema-quality lenses to make our film look gorgeous. 
$2,000 for sound. As a great DP once said, ""Nobody ever left the theater hummin' a nice two-shot."" Sound can make or break a great film, and we need to hire the best production sound artist with the finest equipment to assure our story sounds as awesome as it looks
$3,000 -- Location, location, location. There are some shots we can ""steal"", but several we will need to rent and permit, so that our story's backdrop is as detailed, real and beautiful as the story requires. 
$1,500 -- Production Design. Even the best locations require some Art Direction to make the story feel at home. 
$3,500  -- Insurance. We will be filming under the auspices of SAG/AFTRA, which requires we have the proper insurance to keep all of our players covered and safe. 
$2,500 -- meals/craft services. If you're going to ask artists to work for cheap or free, it is only fair and decent you feed them well.
$1,500 -- Transportation: Fuel, parking, renting a picture-car. LA, baby.
$1,000 -- Contingencies and miscellaneous. Because, as we all know, stuff has a tendency to happen. 

If for some reason we do not reach our full funding goal, we will still make our film with whatever funds we have gathered, and we will make it sing.
What You Get
Prizes! Take a look at the Perks section to see some Awesome Rewards we have to thank you for your awesomeness.

What It Means
We understand that our approach to this project presents a risky prospect for the actors and filmmakers. We not only understand the risks; we embrace the risks. As far as we are concerned, the greater the risk the greater the reward, artistically and personally.

We believe in this story and in this process. We believe that with the right kind of careful preparation we can walk the edge of crazy without being reckless, and that the results will be as exhilarating for us the creators as they will be for you the audience.

<h3>Hard Earth - A Short Film</h3>
<p>A young man with an over extended sense of privilege is left a massive inheritance by his dying step father. There's just one last thing he has to do before he can collect...</p>
<p>Marsha Lane Foster, creator of <a href=""http://www.lanefosterfineart.com/2016/11/the-hostage-project-photo-essay.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Hostage Project</a>, directs this funny, clever, and in a strange sense, life affirming film from a screenplay by Earl Hale.</p>
<p>Although Hard Earth is a short film (around 45 minutes), it's much more than that. With this film, Marsha seeks to build a creative community to collaborate on larger scale projects, a virtual idea factory to make our stories come to life through the collaborative magic of cinema. Hard Earth will collectively be our third venture into visual story telling and we wish to keep that momentum going.</p>
<p>Hard Earth is a short film in production directed by Marsha Lane Foster.  Written by Earl Hale. Josh Irwin is the Director of Photography. The film stars Mark Landon Smith, Jay Plyburn, and C.F. Roberts.</p>

<h3>But, we need your help!</h3>
<p>Principal photography for much of the film has been completed. We are currently shooting the remaining scenes necessary. We will need to raise money to complete the post production process. We're setting a goal of $30,000 to obtain the editing (both image and sound) and special effects hardware necessary to complete this film, as well as meet other important budgetary needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>$15,000 raised will go toward non linear editing equipment, a Digital Audio Workstation, color correction workstation, and studio rental toward needed special effects chroma wall shots.</li>
<li>$15,000 will go toward compensation of our amazing actors and to offset some of the location rental and photographic rental costs already incurred, as well as complete the film's website. </li>

<h3>Expenses</h3>
<p>To make this short film, the cast and crew will need to stay alive and be transported! Here is what your contribution will go toward:</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>It's more important to me that this project is worth the time and hard work of those helping to make it, than it is for me to be a cool filmmaker (but I do think and hope the film will turn out pretty rad!).  And if it's worth it to the cast and crew who have already signed on, I can only hope it will be worth a small contribution from you as well!</p>
<p>I've been on too many film sets where it's all about achieving the director's vision and not the collaborative choices and creative compromises that the medium of filmmaking requires. I want to move towards an approach where the director is a magnifying glass that focuses input from all departments.</p>

</div></div>","What is Don't Schmuck It Up? 






 

Created by Sam Reetz and Juliet Picard, Don't Schmuck It Up is a scripted web series and situational comedy about defying stereotypes in everyday situations.Jules Veritas (Picard) and Avery Ardente (Reetz) are two millennial reporters taking the ESPN hockey world by storm and redefining what it means to be a career woman in NYC in the process.


Where are we in the production timeline?
 Currently, we've filmed and self-produced Episodes 1-4 and are rounding out production on the rest of Season 1 by July 2016. Production costs add up fast, though, and we'd like to pay our stellar cast and crew for all their hard work in making this show concept a reality. We need YOUR help to make this possible, get our name out there to web fests AND get Season 2 funded in time to meet our August 2016 production slate.

How is our show concept different? Unlike other female-driven web series, Don't Schmuck It Up turns the tables on women in hockey and the classic romantic comedy. It's 30 Rock meets Sex and the City and ESPN's SportsCenter.

</div><div>
<p>Italian (25). A true Slow Food aficionado, Agostino is a manifestation of old traditions and new ideas: As a “rooted explorer”, he sees life from a food perspective. While sharing a flat during their business studies at Bocconi University,  Sava and Ago laid out the plans for a sustainable food venture. An idea that gradually evolved in to our project, inspired by Ago’s experiences during his master at the Slow Food University (UNISG).</p>

<p>Dutch (25). An entrepreneurial idealist, Sava seeks to combine technology and big ideas with social impact. At ESADE Business School, he became fascinated with Socratic Dialogue: a powerful method to find answers to universal questions, or build bridges between opposing world views, based on consensus and mutual understanding. A passion that will surely help us to go below the surface and uncover more...</p>

<p>Italian (22). Stefano is a natural storyteller who loves to capture and reshape life through the lens of his camera, something he gets to do every day while studying film at Bournemouth University in the UK. Growing up on his family’s biomasseria Lama di Luna, sustainable farming and Italian food culture run through his veins. It was only a matter of time until his roots and his passion for filmmaking would come together...</p>

<p>American (25). After working in Africa and Latin America for Global Brigades, an international development organization, Luke discovered how generalized media portrayal of low income countries often dehumanizes local lives and renders local communities voiceless in their own story. As a result, Luke founded Redefined Films, a platform that democratizes media and empowers stories that matter, such as our project.</p>

<p>American (21). Alison is a senior biology major who has found her calling in graphic design. Fueled by her curiosity for understanding the world around us, she focuses on designing for organizations that aim to share underrepresented perspectives. She was introduced to our project after interning for Redefined Films, where she created marketing materials and other deliverables for their recent documentaries.

<p>Slow Food was founded in 1989 to prevent the disappearance of local food cultures and traditions. Since then, it has grown into a global movement involving millions of people in over 160 countries, working to ensure access to good, clean and fair food for everyone.</p>
<p>Slow Food’s world vision revolves around the idea that food is tied to many other aspects of life, including culture, politics, agriculture and the environment. Through our food choices we can collectively influence how food is cultivated, produced and distributed, and as a result bring about great change.</p>

THE TEAM
Agostino Petroni - Gastronome


Italian (25). A true Slow Food aficionado, Agostino is a manifestation of old traditions and new ideas: As a “rooted explorer”, he sees life from a food perspective. While sharing a flat during their business studies at Bocconi University,  Sava and Ago laid out the plans for a sustainable food venture. An idea that gradually evolved in to our project, inspired by Ago’s experiences during his master at the Slow Food University (UNISG).
UNISG - MA Food Culture & Communication
Sava Riaskoff - Social Entrepreneur

Dutch (25). An entrepreneurial idealist, Sava seeks to combine technology and big ideas with social impact. At ESADE Business School, he became fascinated with Socratic Dialogue: a powerful method to find answers to universal questions, or build bridges between opposing world views, based on consensus and mutual understanding. A passion that will surely help us to go below the surface and uncover more...
ESADE Business School - MSc Innovation & Entrepreneurship
Stefano Petroni - Film Director

Italian (22). Stefano is a natural storyteller who loves to capture and reshape life through the lens of his camera, something he gets to do every day while studying film at Bournemouth University in the UK. Growing up on his family’s biomasseria Lama di Luna, sustainable farming and Italian food culture run through his veins. It was only a matter of time until his roots and his passion for filmmaking would come together...
Bournemouth University - BA Television Production
Luke Namer - Film Maker

American (25). After working in Africa and Latin America for Global Brigades, an international development organization, Luke discovered how generalized media portrayal of low income countries often dehumanizes local lives and renders local communities voiceless in their own story. As a result, Luke founded Redefined Films, a platform that democratizes media and empowers stories that matter, such as our project.
Cornell University - BA Political Science & Government

Alison Staffin - Graphic designer

American (21). Alison is a senior biology major who has found her calling in graphic design. Fueled by her curiosity for understanding the world around us, she focuses on designing for organizations that aim to share underrepresented perspectives. She was introduced to our project after interning for Redefined Films, where she created marketing materials and other deliverables for their recent documentaries.

KICKOFF EVENT
September 23 @ Terra Madre Salone Del Gusto 2016

We have been invited by Slow Food to present our project at this year’s ‘Terra Madre Salone del Gusto’, together with the representatives of the Terra Madre communities that will host us. We await you at our kickoff event on Saturday September 23rd at 14:30h in the stand of the University of Gastronomic Science (UNISG).
‘Terra Madre Salone del Gusto’ is the largest food and wine fair in the world. Around 250,000 chefs, scientists, food producers, students, and politicians from over 150 countries will gather to share their food and their vision for the future of our global food system. The event will take place from September 22nd to September 26th in Turin, Italy. Come join us!
 
SUPPORTED BY

Slow Food was founded in 1989 to prevent the disappearance of local food cultures and traditions. Since then, it has grown into a global movement involving millions of people in over 160 countries, working to ensure access to good, clean and fair food for everyone.
Slow Food’s world vision revolves around the idea that food is tied to many other aspects of life, including culture, politics, agriculture and the environment. Through our food choices we can collectively influence how food is cultivated, produced and distributed, and as a result bring about great change.

Terra Madre is an international network spread out over 150 countries, uniting food producers, fishers, breeders, chefs, academics, students, NGOs and representatives of local communities. They work on a new approach to food production and gastronomy, based on the defense of biodiversity, environmental protection and respect for local cultures and traditions.

The ESADE Entrepreneurship Institute (EEI) is dedicated to academic excellence in the field of entrepreneurship and a variety of related subjects. Their mission is to become the international reference point in the field of entrepreneurship, venture capital, entrepreneurial creativity, as well as innovation and growth through an active educational model, a rigorous research programme and an active presence in the social debate. 

RedefinedFilms.org is a social action media website that shifts the media paradigm by changing the way content is driven. Redefined empowers socially conscious citizens to tell stories that matter by enabling them to raise awareness and funds for the cause they care about.

<p>RheinoRex in partnership with Whatever the Mood bring you a web series for the new times.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>THE SO-SO YOU DON’T KNOW web series is a dark comedy about urban loneliness.  We all know what it’s like to search for love to take away the emptiness inside, only to find out it’s an inside job.  Therapist Rhonda Vasalo is running a Groupon special for new clients, but little do these New Yorkers know what they signed up for.  Love is hard, but self-love is harder.</p>
<p>The characters in each episode run the gamut of race, creed, age and sexual orientation.  What everyone has in common is the need to connect.</p>
<p>I am a filmmaker who has shot over 60 music videos (including 2Pac’s last and one for Amy Winehouse), commercials, short films and a feature.  I was selected by Filmmaker Magazine as one of their “Top 25 New Faces of Independent Film,” and have been reviewed by the New York Times and featured on radio shows.     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477020158/m85ehdrvbfncduzai8bm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Help me raise $30,000 so that I can shoot all episodes of Season One and get it out to the public.  This money will go towards hiring local NY crew and actors, pay for locations, permits, lighting, sound equipment, post-production crew, sound design, music composition, and lobster tail for my daily lunch.  Just kidding.  About the daily part.</p>
<p>Your donations will help bring this project to into the hearts and minds of others.  The goal of all of my projects, particularly this one, is to touch and uplift people using the guise of humor and entertainment.  We all seek out stories that resonate with us, and I promise you this one will do just that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your generous donations will earn you some amazing things, like a free therapy session with the show's actual therapist or a day on the set with the cast and crew.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Have you often craved video content that resonates with you in a real way?  This show is a chance to connect to people's hearts, let the lonely know they're not alone, and turn the challenges we all face into laughter.  You contributing means putting legs on this project - taking it from script to screen - putting something good out there.  Entertainment with humanity.  You can even submit one of your own tales of love/loneliness for a chance at having an episode written about it.</p>

<p>We love tech and we love a do-it-yourself approach that get's kid's learning in a creative way. But too often tech and craft toys are limited to indoor activities. We believe that kids and their toys shouldn't be limited to inside or outside, creative or active. That's why we created Dronoid, a safe, easy to construct, easy to customize and easy to fly drone toy for kids.</p>

<p>We at Dronoid believe in rigorous quality control. We have set up an overseas office to inspect the products on site, as well as third party testing facilities to ensure a quality product.</p>
<p>Our goal was to make drone flying even more fun for the whole family. That’s why Dronoid is modular. Sure, it’s a flying drone, but it’s also a land rover and an all-terrain tank—all in the same toy!</p>
<p>Dronoid lets kids ages 8 and up build the toys they play with, making it a fun, outdoor activity for parents and kids to enjoy together.</p>

</div></div>","We love tech and we love a do-it-yourself approach that get's kid's learning in a creative way. But too often tech and craft toys are limited to indoor activities. We believe that kids and their toys shouldn't be limited to inside or outside, creative or active. That's why we created Dronoid, a safe, easy to construct, easy to customize and easy to fly drone toy for kids.




We at Dronoid believe in rigorous quality control. We have set up an overseas office to inspect the products on site, as well as third party testing facilities to ensure a quality product.
Our goal was to make drone flying even more fun for the whole family. That’s why Dronoid is modular. Sure, it’s a flying drone, but it’s also a land rover and an all-terrain tank—all in the same toy!
Dronoid lets kids ages 8 and up build the toys they play with, making it a fun, outdoor activity for parents and kids to enjoy together.

Let your kid’s personality fly. The Dronoid Starter Kit includes 1 Drone, Camera, Charger, Remote Control, Propellers, Lithium Ion Battery, Transmitter and 1GB card.
You can choose the Good Guy in white and blue, the Bad Guy in black and red, or the Princess in white and pink.




You can even customize Dronoid by choosing your favorite face, body, and color—Dronoid lets your kid’s personality shine!
Fun attachments like an HD camera let kids film movies anywhere their Dronoid goes, with more fun features always on the way.


Rule the ground, no matter how rough the terrain. The Dronoid Tank Kit includes 2 large tank tread and wheel attachments.


Not your ordinary remote-controlled car. The Dronoid Rover Kit includes 2 large wheel attachments, 1 small wheel attachments, and 2 arm attachments.


You can customize your Dronoid with a new face and body, currently available in Orange, Aquamarine or Commando Green.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;"">JONAS is set in the Deep South about a teenage kid named Jonas growing up in a rural town in 1973 . We find Jonas on a hot afternoon the day of his eighteenth birthday; bailing on one of his last days of high school for a day by the pool with his carnivalesque cousin Tyler and the doe-eyed Susan; his new fling. His only worry involves steering clear of his careworn mother Jonna. As a young, single mother, Jonna makes it her goal to keep Jonas in her cross-hairs; ensuring that he does what's expected of him as a young man who's reveling in his youth and taking advantage of every leisure that small town living has to offer.</p>

<h3>What's it about?</h3>
<p><i>All the Things You Are </i>is a short film about a granddaughter, Taylor, and grandmother, Marion shortly after the passing of their grandfather and husband, Paul. One day, they try to cheer themselves up by going to the mall - but an unexpected moment occurs to remind them that while Paul is not physically here, he lives on in other ways, and specifically, through music.</p>
<p>This film is written and directed by me, and takes inspiration from my own experience with my grandfather. His love of music influenced me to this day and I want to pay tribute to him through this film.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My grandmother is gracious enough to let us use her house in New Jersey for filming. That takes care of location, which is great! But...</p>

<b>Transportation: </b><i>Getting </i>all of the lovely crew members and actors who have decided to work on this project is another story. It can get quite expensive to transport everyone since we are all coming from New York! Our equipment, borrowed from NYU, also needs to be transported down for the two days of filming. Your donation will help us immensely for transportation funds!</li>
<li>
<b>Food: </b>Our other biggest expense is food for the crew. While its a relatively small crew, we still need to be well fed and able to work hard for the film. Your donation will also help for food funds!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Brandon Hugo Arroyo, a Junior in the SUNY Purchase Film Conservatory. As a Puerto Rican filmmaker, I find that the discussion of identity provides its hand rather simply in my life. The question of purpose or place, as one grows older, is something that overlooks the steps taken to achieve what one has earned. With this film, I plan on telling a story that shares a coming of age tale that simply seeks to appreciate the sacrifices made by parents to pursue our own individual voices.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $2,800 to go towards cast&amp;crew, food, transportation, and location. As well as any art direction and design work needed to promote the film. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this film is small but speaks to a larger political issue in cinema as well as the United States. The misrepresentation and underrepresentation of Women and Latinos in media needs to be better handled. As a filmmaker, as a spectator, as a participant in this discussion, your voice in contribution makes the impact of the film all the more apparent.</p>

<h2><strong>How did it all start?!</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Yana. I am Bulgarian. But now I live in South Korea. I am a student at Chung-Ang university in Seoul and my major is film directing. And here is the story behind the 2nd short fiction film I shot in Korea in Korean with Korean actors:</p>
<p><br/>When I arrived in Korea almost 3 years ago I had to spend 1 year learning Korean in a city called Gwangju. I didn‘t have any expectations for it. And then it happened: I fell for it. I fell for Gwangju, for its people and streets, for its parks and its sun, for its past and present. Why? There is no logical explanation – just as you cannot explain logically why you love somebody. It is a feeling inside of you.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488607055/sjqebxtp4s0jz92urib9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>So after I went up to Seoul to study film directing, it was a bitter-sweet emotion. Because part of me would always stay in Gwangju.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488607430/ocvbfrdttmdmfnixxqxw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>And then I got an assignment to shoot a short film...</strong></h2>
<p>And my heart jumped: can I? Can I really try and tell a story about that city I fell for?</p>
<p>It took months of reading books, watching documentaries or fiction films dedicated to Gwangju and its past. It took months for the story to take a shape in my head. It took months to decide which of all the Gwangju images I have in my mind I want to show.</p>
<p>And that's how the story  connected with an important historical event from the past of Gwangju was created. But this short film is not just about the past, it is a tale about the choices we make and the strength we need to go on.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell a universal story - showing characters that can be seen in any corner of the world. Talking about issues, struggles, doubts, fears and dreams that everybody can relate to.</p>

<h3><i><strong>November Will Be May</strong></i></h3>
<p><i>This is the story of a woman in her late 50ies. Living alone after her husband passed away and her daughter went for work abroad, she has just retired from her job as a book editor. But one day she decides to take one more last assignment and go on a 1-day trip along with a writer researching for his new book. The trip will take her back to a city which hides the secrets of her past. Will she be able to face them?</i></p>
</div>
<h2><strong>What was to follow?</strong></h2>
<p>Gathering a team, location scouting, casting, rehearsing, storyboarding...</p>
<p>And then it was time to go to Gwangju and to actually shoot the film. It was an amazing experience – to be back in the city, to be back at those places so dear to my heart... and all this with an amazing team!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488607599/skj0ocuiebyfdl7rhgof.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong><u>But now it is time to finish the journey... </u></strong></p>
<p>And I need some more help. Despite all the efforts there are holes in the budget and any support will bring this film closer to life.</p>
<p>Any money we get from this campaign will go for:</p>
<ul>
<li>the rights for the music used in the film</li>
<li>the sound design</li>
<li>making the poster and the other visuals</li>
<li>applying for festivals</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the last point needs some clarification: many people don‘t know but there a lot of festivals that require an entrance fee if you want to submit your film for consideration. For a short film that film can range from 5$ till 40$. And for now getting into festivals is the only way for me as a director to build my resume and gain some attention to my work...</p>

And that's how the story  connected with an important historical event from the past of Gwangju was created. But this short film is not just about the past, it is a tale about the choices we make and the strength we need to go on.
I wanted to tell a universal story - showing characters that can be seen in any corner of the world. Talking about issues, struggles, doubts, fears and dreams that everybody can relate to.



 

November Will Be May
This is the story of a woman in her late 50ies. Living alone after her husband passed away and her daughter went for work abroad, she has just retired from her job as a book editor. But one day she decides to take one more last assignment and go on a 1-day trip along with a writer researching for his new book. The trip will take her back to a city which hides the secrets of her past. Will she be able to face them?

What was to follow?
Gathering a team, location scouting, casting, rehearsing, storyboarding...
And then it was time to go to Gwangju and to actually shoot the film. It was an amazing experience – to be back in the city, to be back at those places so dear to my heart... and all this with an amazing team!


But now it is time to finish the journey... 
And I need some more help. Despite all the efforts there are holes in the budget and any support will bring this film closer to life.
Any money we get from this campaign will go for:

the rights for the music used in the film
the sound design
making the poster and the other visuals
applying for festivals

I think the last point needs some clarification: many people don‘t know but there a lot of festivals that require an entrance fee if you want to submit your film for consideration. For a short film that film can range from 5$ till 40$. And for now getting into festivals is the only way for me as a director to build my resume and gain some attention to my work...",8.0,0,"1 Campaign
