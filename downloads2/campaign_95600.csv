</ol></div>","Art by HakonArt by PiperFogABOUT WRITSCRIBWritScrib was born from a frustration with current social networks. However, while most new social networks advertise themselves as ""the next Instagram"" or ""the next Facebook"", we want to be something new. Something creator-focused. Something community-focused. Something for those niche-businesses that can't compete in an ocean of competitors. WritScrib is for those that have wasted countless dollars chasing success in hostile social spaces. WritScrib is made for you.WHAT USERS ARE SAYING""WritScrib's aim is to provide an environment for creators to produce their content safely...It's a labor of love put together by actual creators.""""I can post my art and get excited at money potentially rolling in instead of getting scared of people making up reasons to hate me for it!""""You can make money for dad jokes, as long as they're yours. 10/10 would pun again.""""When I first heard about Writscrib...I was dubious. I mean, could a place really allow for creative freedom and keep harassment at bay? But after following the blog for a while and seeing the plans the staff had in place for myriad subjects, I threw as much money as I possibly could at it because I wanted it to be real...The freedom I've felt to create during the beta is more than I've felt in a long time...But really, that blog feature, though. Heart. EYES.""“We’re safe here.”WRITSCRIB'S FEATURESWhile WritScrib still has a ways to go, we've already added quite a few features!

Created for safe and easy assembly
Equipped with actuators and sensor blocks that work without external connections
Functions via wireless communication, which makes it possible for users to code in numerous combinations
Compatible with Legos for creative purposes, so children can innovate without restrictions
An opportunity for young ones to learn STEM concepts and simple programming
A source of confidence and a sense of accomplishment for young ones when they successfully build and operate their own robots
   Kids from preschool to elementary school can learn coding easily. You can teach kids easily in Montessori Schools, elementray schools, publich institutions, STEM institutions, and robot institutions.              Introducing Cubroid, the world’s easiest programming block set that allows children to explore the world of technology and gain exposure to programming! Through dynamic connective blocks and simple programming, Cubroid offers a fun and educational experience for children to express their creativity.  Cubroid’s control programming application enhances the educational aspect of Cubroid by allowing children to control and prompt movement in their robot creations. Each Cubroid block comes with built-in Bluetooth capabilities that enable wireless communication. The app allows you to control movement of your Cubroid with a remote control We currently provide our programming and control application on Androids and iPhones. In order to program the movements of your robot, use the simple programming function. Our app also allows you to directly control your robot through our virtual remote control. Cubroid can be connected to a block programming software program called ""Scratch"" from MIT Media Lab. Scratch is an in-depth programming application that will prompt you to take your programming skills to the next level. Cubroid can be operated through the Scratch programming platform when the master block is connected to a PC with a USB cable. Scratch Mode is recommended for more advanced users that are working to really hone in on their programming abilities.in-depth programming application that will prompt you to take your programming skills to the next leve  For those moments you don’t want to have to control your robot, there is an Automatic Mode that is operated through sensors. There is no need for a PC or smartphone with Auto Mode, as simple movements are programmed into the master block’s functions. As long as the robot contains the master block, Auto Mode will be available.  The Master Block is the control center of virtually any robot that one can build with Cubroid! With the Master Block, you can easily switch between the different modes and functions.      In comparison to other programming modular sets, Cubroid is impressively easy-to-use and designed for the optimal innovative experience. With Cubroid, children have the opportunity to build robots and then bring their creations to life! We have designed Cubroid to be compatible with Lego blocks, so that young creators won’t face innovative restrictions.   Assemble in any direction and order like Legos!
 

 
Experience easy and fun programming through intuitive programming apps.
 
Playing with Cubroid will help grow your child's creativity.
 
With Cubroid, you can learn Scratch in a fun and easy way.

In addition, they may only be operated in an industrial setting cleared for use of these classes of machines.</p><p>In addition, thanks to its detachable wheels and manageable weight, CraftLaser can be moved with ease and conveniently stowed away until the next time you need it.</p><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528957198/ldd76hldofe81ymvpytd.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>H13 HEPA Medical Grade Air Filter</i></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Heavy Duty Air Filtration </strong></h3><p>To achieve its mission of being able to operate anywhere, we designed the CraftLaser to effectively trap fumes and smoke. In addition to our proprietary air scrubbing system, the filter on it is a serious piece of business. The H13 HEPA Medical Grade air filter is certified for use in nuclear power generation facilities, clean rooms, pharmaceutical production lines and operating theatres. It has been tested in accordance with standard EN 1822-3 and EN 1822-4/IES RP-CC-001.3.</p><p>In addition, we have also added an activated carbon filter which has a CTC activity of above 70% and up to 90% (CCI4) measured by ASTM standard test method D3467-88.

One camera is aimed to show where the laser is going to cut (you can use this to aim the laser and place your design anywhere within the cutting area), and the second camera gives you an overall view.

<p><strong>All my life I’ve loved making things</strong>, and loved the magic of handmade objects. I've been privileged to share my love of craftwork with many children and interested adults, working in media as diverse as wood, paper, ceramic, tin, recycled plastic, leather, wax, and felt      (diversity that is ideal for a toymaker).  Just when I was thinking the perfect workshop might never happen, along came KidAround and Kickstarter, giving me the chance to bring the joy of making toys and other fabulous handmade objects to my community.  There is magic afoot!  </p>
<p><strong>Saugerties</strong> is an historic village in New York’s Hudson Valley, and is home to some extraordinary landmarks, charming scenery, and fascinating shops, but alas, something is missing; there’s no toymaker making toys by hand in Saugerties or anywhere else in the Hudson Valley. </p>
<p><strong>In Owliecat Toys' new workshop</strong>, I am joyfully collaborating with KidAround to offer the public a chance to buy fairly priced old-fashioned (or madly invented) toys, musical instruments and other hand made objects -all of my own making - and to see and learn how they are made.  Your pledge toward this effort will enable me to transform this lovely space into a functioning workshop. </p>
<p>I'll invite you, the community, into this new workshop to learn by watching and by doing.  I'll offer group classes, private sessions, and apprenticeships to anyone who wants to share in the joy of handcrafting.</p>

<p>We launched this campaign after receiving a favorable response in a <a href=""http://www.99polls.com/poll_393013:1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">poll</a>
posted on October 28 at <a href=""http://pesn.com/2013/10/28/9602385_Aviation-2.0_enables_Jetpacks_VTOL_flying-cargo-ships/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PESN</a>
asking how much people would be willing to contribute to this project. In the
first 5 days following that, 176 people chimed in, with 22 people saying they
would contribute ""more than $1000"", 10 saying they would contribute
""500 or more,"" etc... The total tally was $33,580, as of 8:45 pm
Mountain time, November 1.<br/><br/>
My recommendation to Raphial was to go for a much lower number than $100k, since
people tend to think ""bottomless pit"" when they see a number like
that. However, he wanted to go with a goal that would actually accomplish
something substantial.<br/><br/>
So, those of you who pledged, we're leaning on you to follow through and help 
prime this pump!</p>

Morgado</a> of Angel Labs LLC.</i><br/><br/><br/>
Since 2001, Raphial Morgado, who, to me, is like hanging around with Leonardo da
Vinci, has been working on an advanced engine that is actually very simple in
its components.<br/><br/>
As we've been reporting on this over the years, we've summarized it
saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>""The MYT™ Engine features 40 times higher power-to-weight ratio, low parts count, low maintenance, high mechanical efficiency, and low pollution. It is poised to benefit applications including airplanes, ships, 18 wheelers, SUVs, passenger cars, and even down to carry-on power generators. The MYT™ Engine, as a pump/compressor, also exceeds existing pumps/compressors in providing massive pressure, volume, and flow; all in one unit.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His patented 14-inch engine, which was the star of the show at the 2006 LA
Auto Show, and First-Prize winner in the 2006 Emhart-NASA Tech Briefs
""Create the Future"" Design Contest, ran on diesel-related fuels for
its first 9 months before Raphial converted it to run on pressurized air (so it
could be run indoors at the LA Auto show). <br/><br/>
It has performed well in <a href=""http://www.angellabsllc.com/data.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dynamometer
testing</a>, outputting 814 foot-pounds of torque with just 150 psi of input air, at 800
rpm.  <br/><br/>
Last year, Lieutenant Colonel Brett Laboo of the Australian Department of
Defense <a href=""http://pesn.com/2012/11/21/9602227_Australian_DOD_Comparative_Analysis_Places_MYT_Engine_in_Top_Position/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">published</a>
a comparative analysis of Raphial's Massive Yet Tiny engine, which packs by far
the most powerful punch for its small size, compared to other diesel engines in
the world.<br/><br/>
But what is most exciting about the MYT™ Engine is that it enables Aviation
2.0 -- an advance in aviation so profound that it deserves that quantum leap
label. No one else is even seriously thinking about such a name, so last week,
after my visit to Raphial, I was able to grab the domain name: <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Events:2013:October_22-24:Sterling_Allan_Visits_Raphial_Morgado_to_Make_Aviation_2.0_Announcement"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aviation2.com</a>
to forward to our PESWiki feature index on Raphial's work, then later to hand it
over to him when his team gets a website built for it. <br/><br/>
Since I was a kid, I've been wondering: ""When will we ever get our jet
packs? When are we going to get our flying cars?""<br/><br/>
Raphial's technology makes that possible because its power-to-weight ratio is so
high. When just one 25-pound, six-inch in diameter engine can produce 200
horsepower (nearly 150 kilowatts equivalent), now you've got something you can
strap on your back, connect to some propellers, and go airborne, with a range of
100 miles on one 1.5-gallon tank of fuel. If your cargo is fuel (diesel-related,
including biodiesel, vegetable oil, and other biofuels that have lubricity), then you could
fly around for a couple of days. The Angel Flight Pack™ is expected to weight
only 48 pounds, dry weight (1.5 gallons of fuel weighs ~11.25 lbs or 5.1 kg),
with dimensions of 24 inches wide, 24 inches high, and 9 inches thick. Thanks to
the pioneering work of Martin Aircraft, the U.S. FAA has imposed a speed limit
of 62 mph for such craft. Doing the math on this -- 100 miles/1.5 gallons -- the Angel Flight Pack™
would have a mileage rating of 67 mpg (US).<br/><br/>
Raphial's got it all designed: including the propellers/fans/compressor blades
(he's been improving that design for about 26 years), the Angel Flight Pack™,
the Stationary Activated Parachute™ (SAP), the flight suit. He's also designed
an 8-passenger VTOL, which he says could fly at Mach 1.4, powered by two
14"" MYT engines -- no landing gear or wings required, further cutting down
on costs, fuel efficiency, and maintenance, while increasing safety. He also has
plans for flying cargo ships that would have the payload of a ship with the
speed of a plane, using the ""ground effect"" flying above the ocean.<br/><br/>
Obviously, the guy is an extreme futurist; and this has made it difficult for
him to find funding to roll out his ideas into the marketplace. His engine
doesn't just increase power and fuel efficiency by a few percentage points, it
does it by several-fold. It's radical in the extreme.<br/><br/>
He's been waiting for years for the funds to be able to finish the 6""
engine, which would make the JetPack possible. Three years ago, he lost his
ranch, where he had a 3,000 square foot machine shop with several employees.<br/><br/>
But he hasn't given up. He's spent that last nine months working up the plans
for ""Aviation 2.0™"", which includes:<br/>
1) The Jetpack, with one 6"" engine<br/>
2) The MYT Turbofan<br/>
3) The VTOL 8 passenger craft that would fly at supersonic speeds, with two 14"" engines<br/>
4) The express mail UAV with two 6"" engines<br/><br/>
The primary thing that has been holding all this back is that he hasn't been
able to secure the funds to complete his 6"" engine.<br/><br/>
People have tried to donate to him over the years, but he declines, since
receiving contributions is against the way he was raised. But now that he
realizes he can offer perks that give something to people in exchange for their
funds, he has decided to go ahead and use this crowdfunding route to obtain the
funds he needs.<br/><br/>
You want to help him reach his goal? You want Jetpacks, VTOL, flying cars,
flying ships, super-efficient and powerful engines?</p>

<h3><a name=""Perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perks</a></h3>
<p>
You will notice that the perks include the opportunity to contribute in exchange
for products
that will result from Angel Lab's success. Those expected products, already
designed by Raphial, include a safe bicycle, motorcycle, SAP, 6"" engine,
14"" engine, JetPack, deposit toward a VTOL; as well as scale models of all
these designs. These items are elaborated below.<br/><br/>
You can select the perks from the column in the right.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name=""Fundraising Goals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fundraising Goals</a></h3>
<p><b>Tier I Goal</b>: $120,000 minimum to finish the 6"" engine and file
patents on it.<br/><br/><br/>
If this campaign happens to go well over the initial goal, which is my hope and
expectation, then here is what
Raphial has in mind:<br/><br/><b>Tier II Goal</b>: Additional $200,000 raised</p>
<p>- build fully functional Angel Flight Pack™ prototype with flight suit<br/>
- build the Stationary Activated Parachute™ (SAP)<br/>
- file patents on these</p>
<p>The completed Angel Flight Pack™ will entail laminations, carbon fiber, high tech materials,
part of which Raphial invented, including high-strength, low weight core for
laminations.</p>
<p><b>Tier III Goal:</b> Additional $100,000 raised</p>
<p>- 1/5-scale VTOL functional prototype to demonstrate to the DOD (in queue
with appointment) <br/>
- file patents on this</p>
<p><b>Funding Overhead</b></p>
<p> 4% will go to Indiegogo if the $125k minimum goal is met. If not, they
retain 9%.<br/>
3% goes to PayPal<br/>
5% goes to us at <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:PES_Network,_Inc."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PES
Network</a> / <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:New_Energy_Systems_Trust_(NEST)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New
Energy Systems Trust (NEST)</a><br/>
12% Total overhead. The balance goes to Raphial, who will use it to accomplish
the goals stated.</p>
<p><b>What if Goal is Not Met?</b></p>
<p>The raised funds will go to Raphial, minus the overhead, and Raphial will use
those funds to get closer to the completion of the 6"" engine.</p>

The thing that makes Aviation 2.0™ possible is the tremendous power-to-weight ratio that
Raphial's <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Massive_Yet_Tiny_(MYT)_Engine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Massive
Yet Tiny (MYT) Engine</a> is capable of. It has high torque and efficiency from low to high rpms. This makes it ideal for aviation, not to mention all the other engine applications it can fill, from vehicles to generators. ""I have so much power I can allow elephants and
brick houses to fly."" To give you engineers a sampling of the kind of power this thing is capable of, with just 150 psi of input air, at 800 rpm, the 14"" engine produced 814 foot-pounds of torque.<br/><br/>
The MYT™ Engine features 40 times higher power-to-weight ratio, low parts count, low maintenance, high mechanical efficiency, and low pollution. It is poised to benefit applications including airplanes, ships, 18 wheelers, SUVs, passenger cars, and even down to carry-on power generators. The MYT™ Engine, as a pump/compressor, also exceeds existing pumps/compressors in providing massive pressure, volume, and flow; all in one unit.<br/><br/>
What is astonishing to the engineers that have worked with Raphial is that the
first 14"" engine he built is still in operation, having been converted from
running on fuel for 6 months (not continuous) to running on compressed air; and
is now being converted back to running on fuel. That a first prototype would
last so long is astonishing to them.<br/><br/>
Modern <b> turbofans</b> produce up to 90% thrust from the fan and 10% from the jet engine
core. This core could be replaced by the MYT Engine, which would remove the heat signature and vastly improve the economy as well as power. Such aircraft could fly
in and out of airports 24 hours, not having to stop late at night because of noise. Another of Raphial's inventions is a quiet muffler that doesn't impede flow. This could also be patented and licensed out to many other applications.<br/><br/>
During dinner with me on October 22, Raphial had the flash of inspiration that the MYT engine could be built as a hybrid engine, using half of it to run on fuel, and the other half to compress air, which could then be stored in a pressure tank to be used to run a compressed air engine such as Angelo DiPietro's
<a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:EngineAir"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EngineAir</a>.<br/><br/>
The development of the 6"" engine -- the focus of this present crowdfunding
campaign -- is a primary goal for Raphial because of the number of applications
it will open up, including the Angel Flight Pack™, vehicle power (small cars,
trucks, planes), generators for business (150 kilowatts), VTOL airmail express
UAVs. <br/><br/>

<h3>
<b><a name=""Angel Flight Pack"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">More About Angel Flight Pack</a></b>™</h3>
<p>
Raphial's Jetpack, alone, would be a crowning achievement of any large company, not to mention a lone inventor. Not only will his Angel Flight Pack™, as it is trademarked, enable human flight, but it will enable payload -- such as carry a second person, or extra fuel for extended range (if the 100-mile range of the standard tank is not enough), or emergency supplies. And it only weighs 45 pounds, so you don't need a parking stall to park it, but you can carry it with you and set it next to you in a restaurant, or at your cubicle at work. He calls it the ""hot rod"" for its power, versatility, and maneuverability.<br/><br/>
The Angel Flight Pack™ would be powered by one 6"" MYT™ engine, called
the MYT-6™.<br/><br/>
Finally, we will have our Jetpacks that cartoons of old got us excited about. However, FAA regulations in the US will limit their speed to 62 miles per hour. But when you can travel ""as the bird flies,"" with no stop lights, stop signs, or traffic, then short-distance travelling will become a snap. Three hours stuck in traffic in large cities will become a 10 to 20 minute jaunt in a Jetpack. In addition to the time savings, think of the fuel savings. 100 miles on
1.5 gallons of fuel, which could include vegetable oil, biodiesel, and other renewable fuels, in any
combination. <br/><br/>
Today, when we think of travel, we think of roads and congestion. But with
jetpacks, not only are you not limited to a narrow road, you're not limited to a
set elevation, so even if everyone in a large city was flying all at once, the
pure density of people would not be that much. It would be like navigating a
roller skating rink. Those who fly faster, can see what's ahead of them and
avoid it. Likewise, people can see oncoming craft in well enough time to avoid
it. Of course JetPack users will need to stay out of commercial flight heights
and lanes.<br/><br/>
Thanks to the pioneer work of companies like Martin Aircraft and <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Moller_Skycar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moller
Skycar</a>, the certification process has been developed. It may be that approaching this as an experimental kit will streamline the regulations.</p>

<p>Other companies have developed jetpacks, but they have been inadequate for
size, duration, tethering. These limits are resolved with Raphial's Angel Flight
Pack design, which is small enough to fit through a door, light enough to carry,
and with a range of 100 miles (unless your cargo is fuel, in which you have a
two day range).<br/><br/>
Think of the new sports, travel and exploring opportunities that will open up -- being able to venture to those remote crevices of the planet that were
heretofore inaccessible -- not to mention the traffic benefits.<br/><br/>
 His Angel Flight Pack™ engenders safety, mimicking a bird carrying prey, with another invention -- an umbrella parachute that deploys if needed -- for safe landing, augmented by the cushioned-sole shoes he designed. He calls the umbrella parachute design SAP, for ""Stationary Activated Parachute"", and will be licensing that separately as well.<br/><br/>
Here is a chart Raphial worked up comparing his Angel Flight Pack™ to the Martin
JetPack.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pureenergysystems.com/news/2013/10/28/9602385_Aviation-2.0_enables_Jetpacks_VTOL_flying-cargo-ships/Comparison-of-JetPack_Specifications_700.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The 290 lbs gross weight represents Maximum takeoff weight. Martin 
Aircraft did not provide a dry weight in their specs. The Angel Flight Pack 
take-off weight breakdown is:<br/>
-  Flight Pack... Dry weight ...............................45 lbs.<br/>

-  S.A.P. ( Stationary Activated Parachute).........5-7 lbs.<br/>

<p>
He also showed me a model he built years ago to illustrate his concept for a VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) craft that would enable the human occupants to be floated by parachute to safety if something bad happened to the flying portion of the craft. And it would facilitate pre-loading and post-un-loading separate from the flying portion. (You can see it up on the shelf at the end of the
<a href=""http://youtu.be/lZ0lZFa1C_I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Formula 1 Race Car Design video</a>.)<br/><br/>
His VTOL could be applied to a mini-van or a cargo ship. Wings and landing gear are not needed, along with their complex engineering, cost, maintenance, weight -- and added expense of fuel to include them. And that's not to mention the fact that the MYT-Engine-powered Turbofan that makes this possible consumes far less fuel than the jet engine that it replaces. Conservatively, we're talking
three to five times less fuel (and even less pollution because of the efficient burn).<br/><br/>
The fan/compressor/propeller design is something Raphial has been improving over 26 years. It's brilliant. He showed me how easily it spins as he waved it back and forth in front of him. It turned easily just by blowing on it, even though the resistance of its size normally would have made it difficult to turn otherwise.<br/><br/>
40% of a commercial aircraft's take-off weight is fuel. Imagine if you could drastically reduce that. The next major expense in commercial aircraft is in tire replacement and landing gear maintenance. This would also be removed in Raphial's VTOL craft. Two thirds of the maintenance cost would be slashed in his craft.<br/><br/>
In his supersonic, Mach 1.4, 8-Passenger, executive jet replacement VTOL design that he showed me, the engine would be fixed, and he would use vectoring or a nozzle to deflect the airflow in the desired direction of thrust.
I'm not an aeronautical engineer, but from what knowledge I have, I would say
that his design is plausible and brilliantly simple.<br/><br/>
 Four of his craft could be parked in the hanger space presently used for one
Gulfstream 550. It could fit in a 2-car garage.<br/><br/>
Here is a chart Raphial worked up comparing his 8-Passenger VTOL with an executive jet.

<p>/End of Comparison<br/><br/>
An early application Raphial wants to tackle is to fit a peaceful drone for delivering mail rapidly from point to point for important transactions. It would be fitted with two 6"" engines and be a VTOL craft, to help get the world acclimated to the new technology approach.</p>

<b><a name=""Flying Cargo Ships"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flying Cargo Ships</a></b>
</h3>
<p>
Imagine small cargo ships the size of a fat yacht flying 500 miles per hour across the ocean, 50 to 500 feet above the surface of the flat ocean, made far more efficient because of the ""ground effect"" that increases the compression efficiency that helps lift the craft because it has something to push against. Rather than cargo taking 2+ months to go from extreme continent to continent stretches, it would take 48 hours. The newest cargo ship designs that can carry 17,000 shipping containers but only travel 18 mph become obsolete. And you can go direct from point to point rather than having to
follow established shipping lanes that take advantage of natural ocean currents. And, where the land is not punctuated by cliffs, large hills, and mountains, you could fly inland as well.<br/><br/>
The cargo industry is a 13 trillion dollar per year industry, and Raphial's technology completely revolutionizes the entire industry. Ninety percent of world commerce involves cargo ships. Imagine if the shipping time and expenses were drastically cut, not by a few percentage points, but 30+ fold on the time, and
3- to 5-fold on the cost.<br/><br/>
Ever since Howard Hughes flew his monster craft on the ground effect 50 years ago, the Russians have been working on this concept. They call it Ekranoplan. Do a

But with the MYT Engine as the driver, you now have the power density needed for this concept to really take flight. </p>

<p>Raphial owns a 58-foot catamaran that is a one-of-a-kind model that travels 140
mph due in part to this effect. At 50 mph, the body of the catamaran begins to rise above the water, leaving only its two lower portions in the water. (Click

<p>Some of you might be wondering why Raphial doesn't just sell this catamaran. Raphial has tried many times to sell it. At this point, he is able to use the catamaran as collateral.<br/><a href=""http://pesn.com/2013/10/28/9602385_Aviation-2.0_enables_Jetpacks_VTOL_flying-cargo-ships/Mighty-Angel_catamaran_187_rd.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>

<p> Another thing that motivated his quest to traverse water without going through it was the time he spent on a destroyer escort ship during the Vietnam War, where he manned the Anti-Submarine Rocket Launcher. Mother Nature can be very unforgiving when you're out on the water for months at a time, unable to steer around storms.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b><a name=""Aviation 2.0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aviation 2.0™</a></b></h3>
<p> ""Aviation 2.0™"", as Raphial has coined it, includes four subsidiaries that Raphial will sell for
a 20% share in the
stock:<br/>
1) The Jetpack, with one 6"" engine<br/>
2) The MYT Turbofan<br/>
3) The VTOL 8 passenger craft that would fly at supersonic speeds, with two 14"" engines<br/>
4) The mail drone with two 6"" engines<br/><br/>
The flying cargo ships are not included in that 3.1 Billion dollar package, for which he has
a group of interested investors in Saudi Arabia, but he would prefer to sell these subsidiaries to a US company.<br/><br/>
The flying cargo ships with the ""payload of a ship with the speed of a plane"" will be a separate subsidiary. Presently, 90% of world commerce is reliant on ocean cargo, making this a 13 trillion dollar a year industry. ""Nothing will compare to this industrial revolution that's about to happen.""<br/><br/>
All this was hatched in the past nine months, complete with financials, PPMs, and other analysis. It's not of the same caliber as if Boeing, with their huge budget and teams, had done it, but it is a remarkable achievement for a sole inventor with his small
circle of faithful associates.<br/><br/>
Raphial had hoped that the next story he did with us would be of him demonstrating the fully-developed Jetpack, powered by the MYT Engine, but he's grown weary of waiting for the big money to come in. <br/><br/>

<h3><b><a name=""About Raphial Morgado"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">About Raphial Morgado</a></b></h3>
<p>Raphial is an inventive genius akin to Leonardo da Vinci, and a very talented machinist.
He also enjoys singing, going to a karaoke bar each week.<br/><br/>
As a child, Raphial, now 62, dreamt of what we now refer to as ""jetpacks"" which enable humans to fly around with the freedom of a bird. ""We're a superior species, why can't we fly like they do?"" was a thought that has stuck with him, becoming a major theme of his life, consuming his interest and guiding his interactions. <br/><br/>
But as a prolific inventor, that isn't the only thing that has captured his creative thought processes. He claims to have built over 100 different prototype designs so far. And though none of them have hit the marketplace yet, that isn't because they are not viable. Often, it is because they are referred to as ""disruptive technologies"". And the minor inventions get overshadowed by the major ones.<br/><br/>
He won't even let me talk about the thing that has me most excited, by far. If you think JetPacks, VTOL, turbofan, flying cargo ships are awesome, and the (bio) fuel and environmental savings would be a wonderful bonus; it gets even better than
that -- much better. But he values his life. Maybe he'll at least let me say that it has to do with harnessing solar energy to power the engine so that stopping for fuel becomes almost unnecessary.<br/><br/>
Not everything Raphial has invented is disruptive technology. He showed me a roller mechanism that he built for doing ab workouts, that keeps the knees off the floor -- a very simple design he came up with when he had knee problems.<br/><br/>
Descending from German (his actual family name is Franz), Spanish, and Filipino roots, Raphial grew up in a shop in the Philippines involved in bus transportation, where they built busses from the chassis on up, including carpentry, plumbing, machining. He's a hands-on, jack-of-all-trades. ""There are very few things I can't do"".<br/><br/>
He grew up in a manufacturing machine shop with his Dad, learning techniques from some of the best.<br/><br/><a href=""http://pesn.com/2013/10/28/9602385_Aviation-2.0_enables_Jetpacks_VTOL_flying-cargo-ships/IMGA0057_rd.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img align=""right"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pureenergysystems.com/news/2013/10/28/9602385_Aviation-2.0_enables_Jetpacks_VTOL_flying-cargo-ships/IMGA0057_400.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>When Raphial went to the awards banquet to receive first prize at the 2005 Emhart-NASA Tech Briefs ""Create the Future"" Design Contest for his
MYT Engine that makes
Aviation 2.0™ possible, the security detail at the door thought he was making fun of them when he showed up with just four people (one of whom was the VP of Exxon-Mobile). Lockheed Martin, with their 16 people, were in second place; and Boeing, with a similar number of proud, representative team members, were in third that year. By the time the award banquet was over, all
attendees agreed that Raphial should have received the Grand Prize. [Memo.
On editing, Raphial noted: ""I checked the NASA tech brief publication and could not find Lockheed
Martin or Boeing as winners. I do remember, that's what the doorman told me...maybe they sponsored or co-worked
with the winners.""]<br/><br/>
I'm thinking that a Nobel Prize would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>
So chalk it up to cognitive dissonance -- people can't believe that a lone inventor could possibly be so prolific and profound. They forget about history's heroes like
<a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Nikola_Tesla"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Nikola Tesla</a>, who brought us AC power, the inductive motor, radio, wireless communication, X-ray, and much, much more -- the foundational bedrock of modern civilization. Still, 100 years later, we haven't figured out how to implement the free energy technologies that Tesla presented in the second half of his life. History books hardly mention him. He's still anathema in college text books, where he gets barely a footnote.<br/><br/>
As a sampling of this same phenomenon with Raphael, several years ago, 50 farmers signed a petition to Governor
Schwarzenegger in support of this MYT Engine technology, saying it could help salvage the California economy, but the petition was ignored.<br/><br/>
Raphial told me a story about how after he received the first million to build the first 14-inch engine, he had an investor ready to pay the next ten million dollars. The investor said he would pay if he could get a ride in the Ford
Focus that had been retrofitted to run on the engine. (<a href=""http://pesn.com/2011/04/18/9501812_MYT_Engine_on_2001_Ford_Focus_on_air/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Story</a>)
The investor had a huge smile on his face. But then he talked to one of Raphial's references who gave a lackluster review compared to what he expected, then the investor's associates wanted to have him invest the 10 million in a bank instead, which could then produce revenue which could be funneled to Raphial. Unfortunately, the bank failed, and all that money was lost.<br/><br/>
The first thing Raphial did when I walked into his home was have me sign a non-disclosure agreement, because he has
not-yet-patented inventions sitting around his house. His 17-year partner, Michelle, is resigned to the fact that the home is an extension of his workshop.<br/><br/>
He showed me a bike design in which the seat is situated close to the ground, greatly increasing stability and safety -- something that is very important to him.</p>

<h3><a name=""Frequently Asked Questions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h3>
<p><b>Q. How sure are you that this 6"" engine will work?<br/>
A. </b>It's just at matter of scaling the 14"" engine down, which was shown
to work, as you can see in the dynamometer reports and testimonial witness
statements of the engineers who worked on the project, including the celebrated <a class=""external text"" href=""http://www.angellabsllc.com/Louis_J_Faix.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""http://www.angellabsllc.com/Louis_J_Faix.html"">Louis
J. Faix</a> and <a class=""external text"" href=""http://www.angellabsllc.com/docs/JoeBunetoBio.doc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""http://www.angellabsllc.com/docs/JoeBunetoBio.doc"">Joe
Buneto</a>.</p>
<p><b>Q. Can you scale it down smaller?<br/>
A. </b>Presently, the 6"" size is about the smallest we could go, given
materials limitations. But further R&amp;D and design improvements are likely to
enable smaller engines yet.</p>
<p><b>Q. Why hasn't some automobile company implemented this yet?<br/>
A.</b> There are a lot of companies in line to be second, waiting for someone
else to go first. Many companies have tried to work deals with Raphial, which
fell through for one reason or another, usually having to do with undervaluing
Raphial's package.</p>
<p><b>Q. How do you harness the heat?<br/>
A.</b> Proprietary</p>
<p><b>Q. Will there be problems from heat with the 6"" engine being situated
so close to the JetPack passenger?<br/>
A.</b> The flight suit will be fitted with heat-deflection technology, but the
air cooling from the environment should be sufficient to keep the engine from
burning the passenger. In hotter climates or conditions, a cooling system may
need to be added, which will diminish the cargo capacity of the JetPack and
increase its weight.</p>
<p><b>Q. What scale will the models be?<br/>
A.</b> This will depend on the size of the full-scale version and the cost of
making models at the time they are ready to be made. They are likely to be
between 1/24 and 1/32.</p>
<p><b>Q. What makes Raphial's </b><b>propellers/fans/compressor blades
different?</b><b><br/>
A.</b> Proprietary, but it involves a larger surface area, also causing higher
torque from nearer the rotation shaft.</p>
<p><b>Q. Why isn't Raphial offering the Fuel Atomizer as a perk and scale model?<br/>
A.</b> He wants to keep that proprietary for as long as possible, and keep it
tied to the Angel Labs LLC suite of products, giving them that added advantage.</p>
<p><b>Q. Are you actually providing these things for sale?<br/>
A.</b> None of these products are available yet commercially. Most of them have
not been patented yet. But once the funding to develop them has been received,
the patents can be filed and they can be brought to market. The ""perk""
amounts listed are to be considered a contribution, not a payment in exchange
for product. Once the products are available commercially, then Raphial will
provide the products as a token of gratitude for the contribution made. This
wording is to give some leeway in the time-frame for patent filing. Once an
official ""sale"" takes place, then the inventor has one year in which
to file a patent, after which he is disallowed. Hence the wording: ""(Provided
as a perk in exchange for donation)""</p>
<p><b>Q. Why is PES / NEST Receiving 5% of funds raised?<br/>
A. </b>PES (and it's recent spin-off, <a href=""http://energynest.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NEST</a>) has been helping Raphial get his story out there. Raphial appreciates
the work PES/NEST does, not just for himself, but for other inventors.</p>
<p><b>Q. How do you raise funds by collecting money for products to be
delivered?<br/>
A. </b>The moneys raised now will go toward the goals stated above. The
accomplishment of those goals will attract investment capital. The crowdfunding
success helps them gauge the market interest in the product.</p>
<p><b>Q. What happens if Raphial dies before this is completed?<br/>
A.</b> Raphial has conveyed his knowledge to a few other people (identities
confidential), who should be able to assist Angel Labs in completing their
tasks.<br/><br/><b>Q. Can I buy <a name=""invest"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> stock</a> in Angel Labs LLC or any of its subsidiary projects?<br/>
A.</b> Presently there are no public offerings (though the subsidiaries are
likely to create such offerings), but qualified investors can
invest, beginning with amounts of $25,000. Please call +1 (916) 370-0886 or +1 (209) 224-1891.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name=""The Impact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Impact</a></h3>
<p>I'm always telling people, ""Free Energy is all about Freedom"".
Imagine the increased freedom that would come from ...</p>
<ul>
<li>JetPack personal flight capability, eliminating gridlock, or making it
    moot; increasing exploration capabilities</li>
<li>VTOL flying car transport at Mach 1.4</li>
<li>Reducing shipping times from 2 months to 2 days, totally revolutionizing
    the shipping industry</li>
<li>Savings on fuel expenses and significant reduction in pollution</li>
<li>24-hour flight capability due to lower noise of VTOL craft not breaking
    noise ordinances</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to mention the benefits of some of Raphial's other innovations ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased safety of flight</li>
<li>Increased safety of bicycles</li>
<li>Increased safety (and power) of motorcycles</li>
<li>Knee-pain-free ab workout</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more benefits that I can't mention yet, which make the above seem
pale in comparison.<br/><br/>
For Raphial, he says: ""The thing that I'm most excited about is that it will bring real jobs to the US.
This is going to employ a lot of people. It could turn the economy around and
bring prosperity.""<br/><br/>
""As I've always said: My success is your success""; and that doesn't
just apply to me.<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<a name=""Risk Factors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Risk Factors</a>:</h3>
<p>There are a few significant risks involved here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though contingencies are in place, if something were to happen to
    Raphial, the projects would certainly be slowed. This is a disruptive
    technology. There are other inventors who were killed, threatened, or bought
    out, or otherwise compromised for less disruptive technologies.</li>
<li>If this project isn't adequately funded, it's possible that it won't be developed, in which case, the products will not be delivered.</li>
<li>If the project is funded, and product development takes place, it's
    possible that the products will not perform as expected, and won't be
    available for commercial roll-out.</li>
<li>It's possible that the products will cost much more than what's expected
    at this time.</li>
<li>Many of his technologies have not yet had patents filed, since Raphial has
    been postponing that as long as possible, since the clock starts ticking
    once the filings are submitted.</li>
<li>Raphial claims to have a way to handle the heat from the engine, which
    otherwise would require a large radiator system; but no such data has yet
    been produced from an actual system, since this is a newer design that
    hasn't yet been built. The new 6"" engine would be the first to
    implement this.</li>
</ul>

""The MYT Engine has so much power it can allow elephants and
      brick houses to fly.""
      -- Raphial Morgado



We launched this campaign after receiving a favorable response in a poll
posted on October 28 at PESN
asking how much people would be willing to contribute to this project. In the
first 5 days following that, 176 people chimed in, with 22 people saying they
would contribute ""more than $1000"", 10 saying they would contribute
""500 or more,"" etc... The total tally was $33,580, as of 8:45 pm
Mountain time, November 1.
My recommendation to Raphial was to go for a much lower number than $100k, since
people tend to think ""bottomless pit"" when they see a number like
that. However, he wanted to go with a goal that would actually accomplish
something substantial.
So, those of you who pledged, we're leaning on you to follow through and help 
prime this pump!

    next to the 14"" engine internals demonstrator, October 22, 2013.



Project Overview
by Sterling
D. Allan, PES Network, Inc. and NEST, in association with Raphial
Morgado of Angel Labs LLC.
Since 2001, Raphial Morgado, who, to me, is like hanging around with Leonardo da
Vinci, has been working on an advanced engine that is actually very simple in
its components.
As we've been reporting on this over the years, we've summarized it
saying: 

""The MYT™ Engine features 40 times higher power-to-weight ratio, low parts count, low maintenance, high mechanical efficiency, and low pollution. It is poised to benefit applications including airplanes, ships, 18 wheelers, SUVs, passenger cars, and even down to carry-on power generators. The MYT™ Engine, as a pump/compressor, also exceeds existing pumps/compressors in providing massive pressure, volume, and flow; all in one unit.""

His patented 14-inch engine, which was the star of the show at the 2006 LA
Auto Show, and First-Prize winner in the 2006 Emhart-NASA Tech Briefs
""Create the Future"" Design Contest, ran on diesel-related fuels for
its first 9 months before Raphial converted it to run on pressurized air (so it
could be run indoors at the LA Auto show). 
It has performed well in dynamometer
testing, outputting 814 foot-pounds of torque with just 150 psi of input air, at 800
rpm.  
Last year, Lieutenant Colonel Brett Laboo of the Australian Department of
Defense published
a comparative analysis of Raphial's Massive Yet Tiny engine, which packs by far
the most powerful punch for its small size, compared to other diesel engines in
the world.
But what is most exciting about the MYT™ Engine is that it enables Aviation
2.0 -- an advance in aviation so profound that it deserves that quantum leap
label. No one else is even seriously thinking about such a name, so last week,
after my visit to Raphial, I was able to grab the domain name: Aviation2.com
to forward to our PESWiki feature index on Raphial's work, then later to hand it
over to him when his team gets a website built for it. 
Since I was a kid, I've been wondering: ""When will we ever get our jet
packs? When are we going to get our flying cars?""
Raphial's technology makes that possible because its power-to-weight ratio is so
high. When just one 25-pound, six-inch in diameter engine can produce 200
horsepower (nearly 150 kilowatts equivalent), now you've got something you can
strap on your back, connect to some propellers, and go airborne, with a range of
100 miles on one 1.5-gallon tank of fuel. If your cargo is fuel (diesel-related,
including biodiesel, vegetable oil, and other biofuels that have lubricity), then you could
fly around for a couple of days. The Angel Flight Pack™ is expected to weight
only 48 pounds, dry weight (1.5 gallons of fuel weighs ~11.25 lbs or 5.1 kg),
with dimensions of 24 inches wide, 24 inches high, and 9 inches thick. Thanks to
the pioneering work of Martin Aircraft, the U.S. FAA has imposed a speed limit
of 62 mph for such craft. Doing the math on this -- 100 miles/1.5 gallons -- the Angel Flight Pack™
would have a mileage rating of 67 mpg (US).
Raphial's got it all designed: including the propellers/fans/compressor blades
(he's been improving that design for about 26 years), the Angel Flight Pack™,
the Stationary Activated Parachute™ (SAP), the flight suit. He's also designed
an 8-passenger VTOL, which he says could fly at Mach 1.4, powered by two
14"" MYT engines -- no landing gear or wings required, further cutting down
on costs, fuel efficiency, and maintenance, while increasing safety. He also has
plans for flying cargo ships that would have the payload of a ship with the
speed of a plane, using the ""ground effect"" flying above the ocean.
Obviously, the guy is an extreme futurist; and this has made it difficult for
him to find funding to roll out his ideas into the marketplace. His engine
doesn't just increase power and fuel efficiency by a few percentage points, it
does it by several-fold. It's radical in the extreme.
He's been waiting for years for the funds to be able to finish the 6""
engine, which would make the JetPack possible. Three years ago, he lost his
ranch, where he had a 3,000 square foot machine shop with several employees.
But he hasn't given up. He's spent that last nine months working up the plans
for ""Aviation 2.0™"", which includes:
1) The Jetpack, with one 6"" engine
2) The MYT Turbofan
3) The VTOL 8 passenger craft that would fly at supersonic speeds, with two 14"" engines
4) The express mail UAV with two 6"" engines
The primary thing that has been holding all this back is that he hasn't been
able to secure the funds to complete his 6"" engine.
People have tried to donate to him over the years, but he declines, since
receiving contributions is against the way he was raised. But now that he
realizes he can offer perks that give something to people in exchange for their
funds, he has decided to go ahead and use this crowdfunding route to obtain the
funds he needs.
You want to help him reach his goal? You want Jetpacks, VTOL, flying cars,
flying ships, super-efficient and powerful engines?

 
Perks

You will notice that the perks include the opportunity to contribute in exchange
for products
that will result from Angel Lab's success. Those expected products, already
designed by Raphial, include a safe bicycle, motorcycle, SAP, 6"" engine,
14"" engine, JetPack, deposit toward a VTOL; as well as scale models of all
these designs. These items are elaborated below.
You can select the perks from the column in the right.
 
Fundraising Goals
Tier I Goal: $120,000 minimum to finish the 6"" engine and file
patents on it.
If this campaign happens to go well over the initial goal, which is my hope and
expectation, then here is what
Raphial has in mind:Tier II Goal: Additional $200,000 raised
- build fully functional Angel Flight Pack™ prototype with flight suit
- build the Stationary Activated Parachute™ (SAP)
- file patents on these
The completed Angel Flight Pack™ will entail laminations, carbon fiber, high tech materials,
part of which Raphial invented, including high-strength, low weight core for
laminations.
Tier III Goal: Additional $100,000 raised
- 1/5-scale VTOL functional prototype to demonstrate to the DOD (in queue
with appointment) 
- file patents on this
Funding Overhead
 4% will go to Indiegogo if the $125k minimum goal is met. If not, they
retain 9%.
3% goes to PayPal
5% goes to us at PES
Network / New
Energy Systems Trust (NEST)
12% Total overhead. The balance goes to Raphial, who will use it to accomplish
the goals stated.
What if Goal is Not Met?
The raised funds will go to Raphial, minus the overhead, and Raphial will use
those funds to get closer to the completion of the 6"" engine.
 

MYT™ Engine Power



In this trademark photo, Raphial shows his 14-inch
    motor in comparison to the engine it could replace.






The thing that makes Aviation 2.0™ possible is the tremendous power-to-weight ratio that
Raphial's Massive
Yet Tiny (MYT) Engine is capable of. It has high torque and efficiency from low to high rpms. This makes it ideal for aviation, not to mention all the other engine applications it can fill, from vehicles to generators. ""I have so much power I can allow elephants and
brick houses to fly."" To give you engineers a sampling of the kind of power this thing is capable of, with just 150 psi of input air, at 800 rpm, the 14"" engine produced 814 foot-pounds of torque.
The MYT™ Engine features 40 times higher power-to-weight ratio, low parts count, low maintenance, high mechanical efficiency, and low pollution. It is poised to benefit applications including airplanes, ships, 18 wheelers, SUVs, passenger cars, and even down to carry-on power generators. The MYT™ Engine, as a pump/compressor, also exceeds existing pumps/compressors in providing massive pressure, volume, and flow; all in one unit.
What is astonishing to the engineers that have worked with Raphial is that the
first 14"" engine he built is still in operation, having been converted from
running on fuel for 6 months (not continuous) to running on compressed air; and
is now being converted back to running on fuel. That a first prototype would
last so long is astonishing to them.
Modern  turbofans produce up to 90% thrust from the fan and 10% from the jet engine
core. This core could be replaced by the MYT Engine, which would remove the heat signature and vastly improve the economy as well as power. Such aircraft could fly
in and out of airports 24 hours, not having to stop late at night because of noise. Another of Raphial's inventions is a quiet muffler that doesn't impede flow. This could also be patented and licensed out to many other applications.
During dinner with me on October 22, Raphial had the flash of inspiration that the MYT engine could be built as a hybrid engine, using half of it to run on fuel, and the other half to compress air, which could then be stored in a pressure tank to be used to run a compressed air engine such as Angelo DiPietro's
EngineAir.
The development of the 6"" engine -- the focus of this present crowdfunding
campaign -- is a primary goal for Raphial because of the number of applications
it will open up, including the Angel Flight Pack™, vehicle power (small cars,
trucks, planes), generators for business (150 kilowatts), VTOL airmail express
UAVs.

More About Angel Flight Pack™

Raphial's Jetpack, alone, would be a crowning achievement of any large company, not to mention a lone inventor. Not only will his Angel Flight Pack™, as it is trademarked, enable human flight, but it will enable payload -- such as carry a second person, or extra fuel for extended range (if the 100-mile range of the standard tank is not enough), or emergency supplies. And it only weighs 45 pounds, so you don't need a parking stall to park it, but you can carry it with you and set it next to you in a restaurant, or at your cubicle at work. He calls it the ""hot rod"" for its power, versatility, and maneuverability.
The Angel Flight Pack™ would be powered by one 6"" MYT™ engine, called
the MYT-6™.
Finally, we will have our Jetpacks that cartoons of old got us excited about. However, FAA regulations in the US will limit their speed to 62 miles per hour. But when you can travel ""as the bird flies,"" with no stop lights, stop signs, or traffic, then short-distance travelling will become a snap. Three hours stuck in traffic in large cities will become a 10 to 20 minute jaunt in a Jetpack. In addition to the time savings, think of the fuel savings. 100 miles on
1.5 gallons of fuel, which could include vegetable oil, biodiesel, and other renewable fuels, in any
combination. 
Today, when we think of travel, we think of roads and congestion. But with
jetpacks, not only are you not limited to a narrow road, you're not limited to a
set elevation, so even if everyone in a large city was flying all at once, the
pure density of people would not be that much. It would be like navigating a
roller skating rink. Those who fly faster, can see what's ahead of them and
avoid it. Likewise, people can see oncoming craft in well enough time to avoid
it. Of course JetPack users will need to stay out of commercial flight heights
and lanes.
Thanks to the pioneer work of companies like Martin Aircraft and Moller
Skycar, the certification process has been developed. It may be that approaching this as an experimental kit will streamline the regulations.






Isn't it about time we got these?


In 1965, two years after I was born, the
        Bell Rocket Belt was the first JetPack to ever be flown freely, without
        being tethered (James Bond film, Thunder Ball).




In 1984, Bill Suitor flew the first ever
        civilian-built JetPack at the Olympics in Los Angeles opening
        ceremonies.


JetLev's water-powered, tethered JetPack
        released in 2011, has shown the modern commercial market interest in
        this capability, even if just for sporting.





Other companies have developed jetpacks, but they have been inadequate for
size, duration, tethering. These limits are resolved with Raphial's Angel Flight
Pack design, which is small enough to fit through a door, light enough to carry,
and with a range of 100 miles (unless your cargo is fuel, in which you have a
two day range).
Think of the new sports, travel and exploring opportunities that will open up -- being able to venture to those remote crevices of the planet that were
heretofore inaccessible -- not to mention the traffic benefits.
 His Angel Flight Pack™ engenders safety, mimicking a bird carrying prey, with another invention -- an umbrella parachute that deploys if needed -- for safe landing, augmented by the cushioned-sole shoes he designed. He calls the umbrella parachute design SAP, for ""Stationary Activated Parachute"", and will be licensing that separately as well.
Here is a chart Raphial worked up comparing his Angel Flight Pack™ to the Martin
JetPack.

Note: The 290 lbs gross weight represents Maximum takeoff weight. Martin 
Aircraft did not provide a dry weight in their specs. The Angel Flight Pack 
take-off weight breakdown is:
-  Flight Pack... Dry weight ...............................45 lbs.
-  Fuel weight @ 1.5 Gallons.............................12-15 lbs.
-  S.A.P. ( Stationary Activated Parachute).........5-7 lbs.
-  Accessories .....................................................15 App. 
lbs.
- Pilot ................................................................208 lbs
____________________________________________
- Total...Maximum Takeoff Weight......................290 lbs.
 
VTOL and Turbofan

He also showed me a model he built years ago to illustrate his concept for a VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) craft that would enable the human occupants to be floated by parachute to safety if something bad happened to the flying portion of the craft. And it would facilitate pre-loading and post-un-loading separate from the flying portion. (You can see it up on the shelf at the end of the
Formula 1 Race Car Design video.)
His VTOL could be applied to a mini-van or a cargo ship. Wings and landing gear are not needed, along with their complex engineering, cost, maintenance, weight -- and added expense of fuel to include them. And that's not to mention the fact that the MYT-Engine-powered Turbofan that makes this possible consumes far less fuel than the jet engine that it replaces. Conservatively, we're talking
three to five times less fuel (and even less pollution because of the efficient burn).
The fan/compressor/propeller design is something Raphial has been improving over 26 years. It's brilliant. He showed me how easily it spins as he waved it back and forth in front of him. It turned easily just by blowing on it, even though the resistance of its size normally would have made it difficult to turn otherwise.
40% of a commercial aircraft's take-off weight is fuel. Imagine if you could drastically reduce that. The next major expense in commercial aircraft is in tire replacement and landing gear maintenance. This would also be removed in Raphial's VTOL craft. Two thirds of the maintenance cost would be slashed in his craft.
In his supersonic, Mach 1.4, 8-Passenger, executive jet replacement VTOL design that he showed me, the engine would be fixed, and he would use vectoring or a nozzle to deflect the airflow in the desired direction of thrust.
I'm not an aeronautical engineer, but from what knowledge I have, I would say
that his design is plausible and brilliantly simple.
 Four of his craft could be parked in the hanger space presently used for one
Gulfstream 550. It could fit in a 2-car garage.
Here is a chart Raphial worked up comparing his 8-Passenger VTOL with an executive jet.
(PDF)

/End of Comparison
An early application Raphial wants to tackle is to fit a peaceful drone for delivering mail rapidly from point to point for important transactions. It would be fitted with two 6"" engines and be a VTOL craft, to help get the world acclimated to the new technology approach.

Flying Cargo Ships


Imagine small cargo ships the size of a fat yacht flying 500 miles per hour across the ocean, 50 to 500 feet above the surface of the flat ocean, made far more efficient because of the ""ground effect"" that increases the compression efficiency that helps lift the craft because it has something to push against. Rather than cargo taking 2+ months to go from extreme continent to continent stretches, it would take 48 hours. The newest cargo ship designs that can carry 17,000 shipping containers but only travel 18 mph become obsolete. And you can go direct from point to point rather than having to
follow established shipping lanes that take advantage of natural ocean currents. And, where the land is not punctuated by cliffs, large hills, and mountains, you could fly inland as well.
The cargo industry is a 13 trillion dollar per year industry, and Raphial's technology completely revolutionizes the entire industry. Ninety percent of world commerce involves cargo ships. Imagine if the shipping time and expenses were drastically cut, not by a few percentage points, but 30+ fold on the time, and
3- to 5-fold on the cost.
Ever since Howard Hughes flew his monster craft on the ground effect 50 years ago, the Russians have been working on this concept. They call it Ekranoplan. Do a
 Google Image search and you'll see at a glance what Raphial is talking about. 
But with the MYT Engine as the driver, you now have the power density needed for this concept to really take flight. 

Raphial owns a 58-foot catamaran that is a one-of-a-kind model that travels 140
mph due in part to this effect. At 50 mph, the body of the catamaran begins to rise above the water, leaving only its two lower portions in the water. (Click
the images for enlargement.)

 


Some of you might be wondering why Raphial doesn't just sell this catamaran. Raphial has tried many times to sell it. At this point, he is able to use the catamaran as collateral.

 Another thing that motivated his quest to traverse water without going through it was the time he spent on a destroyer escort ship during the Vietnam War, where he manned the Anti-Submarine Rocket Launcher.

 ""Aviation 2.0™"", as Raphial has coined it, includes four subsidiaries that Raphial will sell for
a 20% share in the
stock:
1) The Jetpack, with one 6"" engine
2) The MYT Turbofan
3) The VTOL 8 passenger craft that would fly at supersonic speeds, with two 14"" engines
4) The mail drone with two 6"" engines
The flying cargo ships are not included in that 3.1 Billion dollar package, for which he has
a group of interested investors in Saudi Arabia, but he would prefer to sell these subsidiaries to a US company.
The flying cargo ships with the ""payload of a ship with the speed of a plane"" will be a separate subsidiary. Presently, 90% of world commerce is reliant on ocean cargo, making this a 13 trillion dollar a year industry. ""Nothing will compare to this industrial revolution that's about to happen.""
All this was hatched in the past nine months, complete with financials, PPMs, and other analysis. It's not of the same caliber as if Boeing, with their huge budget and teams, had done it, but it is a remarkable achievement for a sole inventor with his small
circle of faithful associates.
Raphial had hoped that the next story he did with us would be of him demonstrating the fully-developed Jetpack, powered by the MYT Engine, but he's grown weary of waiting for the big money to come in. 
Here are some videos I shot directly relevant to Aviation 2.0™.

About Raphial Morgado
Raphial is an inventive genius akin to Leonardo da Vinci, and a very talented machinist.
He also enjoys singing, going to a karaoke bar each week.
As a child, Raphial, now 62, dreamt of what we now refer to as ""jetpacks"" which enable humans to fly around with the freedom of a bird. ""We're a superior species, why can't we fly like they do?"" was a thought that has stuck with him, becoming a major theme of his life, consuming his interest and guiding his interactions. 
But as a prolific inventor, that isn't the only thing that has captured his creative thought processes. He claims to have built over 100 different prototype designs so far. And though none of them have hit the marketplace yet, that isn't because they are not viable. Often, it is because they are referred to as ""disruptive technologies"". And the minor inventions get overshadowed by the major ones.
He won't even let me talk about the thing that has me most excited, by far. If you think JetPacks, VTOL, turbofan, flying cargo ships are awesome, and the (bio) fuel and environmental savings would be a wonderful bonus; it gets even better than
that -- much better. But he values his life. Maybe he'll at least let me say that it has to do with harnessing solar energy to power the engine so that stopping for fuel becomes almost unnecessary.
Not everything Raphial has invented is disruptive technology. He showed me a roller mechanism that he built for doing ab workouts, that keeps the knees off the floor -- a very simple design he came up with when he had knee problems.
Descending from German (his actual family name is Franz), Spanish, and Filipino roots, Raphial grew up in a shop in the Philippines involved in bus transportation, where they built busses from the chassis on up, including carpentry, plumbing, machining. He's a hands-on, jack-of-all-trades. ""There are very few things I can't do"".
He grew up in a manufacturing machine shop with his Dad, learning techniques from some of the best.When Raphial went to the awards banquet to receive first prize at the 2005 Emhart-NASA Tech Briefs ""Create the Future"" Design Contest for his
MYT Engine that makes
Aviation 2.0™ possible, the security detail at the door thought he was making fun of them when he showed up with just four people (one of whom was the VP of Exxon-Mobile). Lockheed Martin, with their 16 people, were in second place; and Boeing, with a similar number of proud, representative team members, were in third that year. By the time the award banquet was over, all
attendees agreed that Raphial should have received the Grand Prize. [Memo.
On editing, Raphial noted: ""I checked the NASA tech brief publication and could not find Lockheed
Martin or Boeing as winners. I do remember, that's what the doorman told me...maybe they sponsored or co-worked
with the winners.""]
I'm thinking that a Nobel Prize would be more appropriate.
So chalk it up to cognitive dissonance -- people can't believe that a lone inventor could possibly be so prolific and profound. They forget about history's heroes like
 Nikola Tesla, who brought us AC power, the inductive motor, radio, wireless communication, X-ray, and much, much more -- the foundational bedrock of modern civilization. Still, 100 years later, we haven't figured out how to implement the free energy technologies that Tesla presented in the second half of his life. History books hardly mention him. He's still anathema in college text books, where he gets barely a footnote.
As a sampling of this same phenomenon with Raphael, several years ago, 50 farmers signed a petition to Governor
Schwarzenegger in support of this MYT Engine technology, saying it could help salvage the California economy, but the petition was ignored.
Raphial told me a story about how after he received the first million to build the first 14-inch engine, he had an investor ready to pay the next ten million dollars. The investor said he would pay if he could get a ride in the Ford
Focus that had been retrofitted to run on the engine. (Story)
The investor had a huge smile on his face. But then he talked to one of Raphial's references who gave a lackluster review compared to what he expected, then the investor's associates wanted to have him invest the 10 million in a bank instead, which could then produce revenue which could be funneled to Raphial. Unfortunately, the bank failed, and all that money was lost.
The first thing Raphial did when I walked into his home was have me sign a non-disclosure agreement, because he has
not-yet-patented inventions sitting around his house. His 17-year partner, Michelle, is resigned to the fact that the home is an extension of his workshop.
He showed me a bike design in which the seat is situated close to the ground, greatly increasing stability and safety -- something that is very important to him.
 
Frequently Asked Questions
Q. How sure are you that this 6"" engine will work?
A. It's just at matter of scaling the 14"" engine down, which was shown
to work, as you can see in the dynamometer reports and testimonial witness
statements of the engineers who worked on the project, including the celebrated Louis
J. Faix and Joe
Buneto.
Q. Can you scale it down smaller?
A. Presently, the 6"" size is about the smallest we could go, given
materials limitations. But further R&D and design improvements are likely to
enable smaller engines yet.
Q. Why hasn't some automobile company implemented this yet?
A. There are a lot of companies in line to be second, waiting for someone
else to go first. Many companies have tried to work deals with Raphial, which
fell through for one reason or another, usually having to do with undervaluing
Raphial's package.
Q. How do you harness the heat?
A. Proprietary
Q. Will there be problems from heat with the 6"" engine being situated
so close to the JetPack passenger?
A. The flight suit will be fitted with heat-deflection technology, but the
air cooling from the environment should be sufficient to keep the engine from
burning the passenger. In hotter climates or conditions, a cooling system may
need to be added, which will diminish the cargo capacity of the JetPack and
increase its weight.
Q. What scale will the models be?
A. This will depend on the size of the full-scale version and the cost of
making models at the time they are ready to be made. They are likely to be
between 1/24 and 1/32.
Q. What makes Raphial's propellers/fans/compressor blades
different?
A. Proprietary, but it involves a larger surface area, also causing higher
torque from nearer the rotation shaft.
Q. Why isn't Raphial offering the Fuel Atomizer as a perk and scale model?
A. He wants to keep that proprietary for as long as possible, and keep it
tied to the Angel Labs LLC suite of products, giving them that added advantage.
Q. Are you actually providing these things for sale?
A. None of these products are available yet commercially. Most of them have
not been patented yet. But once the funding to develop them has been received,
the patents can be filed and they can be brought to market. The ""perk""
amounts listed are to be considered a contribution, not a payment in exchange
for product. Once the products are available commercially, then Raphial will
provide the products as a token of gratitude for the contribution made. This
wording is to give some leeway in the time-frame for patent filing. Once an
official ""sale"" takes place, then the inventor has one year in which
to file a patent, after which he is disallowed. Hence the wording: ""(Provided
as a perk in exchange for donation)""
Q. Why is PES / NEST Receiving 5% of funds raised?
A. PES (and it's recent spin-off, NEST) has been helping Raphial get his story out there. Raphial appreciates
the work PES/NEST does, not just for himself, but for other inventors.
Q. How do you raise funds by collecting money for products to be
delivered?
A. The moneys raised now will go toward the goals stated above. The
accomplishment of those goals will attract investment capital. The crowdfunding
success helps them gauge the market interest in the product.
Q. What happens if Raphial dies before this is completed?
A. Raphial has conveyed his knowledge to a few other people (identities
confidential), who should be able to assist Angel Labs in completing their
tasks.Q. Can I buy  stock in Angel Labs LLC or any of its subsidiary projects?
A. Presently there are no public offerings (though the subsidiaries are
likely to create such offerings), but qualified investors can
invest, beginning with amounts of $25,000. Please call +1 (916) 370-0886 or +1 (209) 224-1891.
 
The Impact
I'm always telling people, ""Free Energy is all about Freedom"".
Imagine the increased freedom that would come from ...

JetPack personal flight capability, eliminating gridlock, or making it
    moot; increasing exploration capabilities
VTOL flying car transport at Mach 1.4
Reducing shipping times from 2 months to 2 days, totally revolutionizing
    the shipping industry
Savings on fuel expenses and significant reduction in pollution
24-hour flight capability due to lower noise of VTOL craft not breaking
    noise ordinances

Not to mention the benefits of some of Raphial's other innovations ...

Increased safety of flight
Increased safety of bicycles
Increased safety (and power) of motorcycles
Knee-pain-free ab workout

There are more benefits that I can't mention yet, which make the above seem
pale in comparison.
For Raphial, he says: ""The thing that I'm most excited about is that it will bring real jobs to the US.
This is going to employ a lot of people. It could turn the economy around and
bring prosperity.""
""As I've always said: My success is your success""; and that doesn't
just apply to me.
 

Risk Factors:
There are a few significant risks involved here.

Even though contingencies are in place, if something were to happen to
    Raphial, the projects would certainly be slowed. This is a disruptive
    technology. There are other inventors who were killed, threatened, or bought
    out, or otherwise compromised for less disruptive technologies.
If this project isn't adequately funded, it's possible that it won't be developed, in which case, the products will not be delivered.
If the project is funded, and product development takes place, it's
    possible that the products will not perform as expected, and won't be
    available for commercial roll-out.
It's possible that the products will cost much more than what's expected
    at this time.
Many of his technologies have not yet had patents filed, since Raphial has
    been postponing that as long as possible, since the clock starts ticking
    once the filings are submitted.
Raphial claims to have a way to handle the heat from the engine, which
    otherwise would require a large radiator system; but no such data has yet
    been produced from an actual system, since this is a newer design that
    hasn't yet been built. The new 6"" engine would be the first to
    implement this.

<p><i><strong>Der Surf deines Lebens wartet auf dich !</strong></i></p>
<p>Wer <strong>die Zeichen der Zeit</strong> lesen und richtig interpretieren kann, surft auf ihren Wellen über jegliche Hindernisse hinweg. </p>
<p>Seit über 14 Jahren surfe ich dank den <strong>magischen Kalendern der Maya</strong> auf den <strong>Wellen der Zeit</strong>. Das bedeutet nicht, dass ich keine Probleme mehr habe. Es bedeutet jedoch, immer mehr <strong>zum optimalen Zeit°Punkt</strong> am <strong>richtigen Ort zu sein</strong>, und damit gar keine Probleme mehr zu erschaffen oder sie in Rekordzeit lösen zu können. Alles nur Zufälle ... ?</p>
<p>Was wäre jedoch, wenn hinter all diesen «Zufällen» <strong>ein System</strong> steckt, das messerscharf und präzise für dich arbeitet, jedoch nur, wenn du die Spielregeln kennst und sie zu deinem Vorteil anwendest ?</p>
<p><strong>Die Mayas waren Meister der Zeit</strong> und deren Zyklen, daher war es für sie <strong>ein Kinderspiel</strong>, Ereignisse «vorauszusagen», weil sie ganz einfach wussten, dass sich alles immer wieder und immer wieder wiederholt, nur stets auf einer höheren, weiter entwickelten Ebene.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491610830/v2seqessybxfd0xew3y3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Doch nicht nur die Mayas wussten davon, der berühmte <strong>Schweizer Psychologe C.G. Jung</strong> kam ebenfalls diesem <strong>Phänomen</strong> auf die Spur und nannte es schliesslich «<strong>Synchronizitäten</strong>». Und genau um das geht es hier !</p>
<p>Stell dir vor, es gibt <strong>für jeden Menschen einen optimalen Lebensplan</strong>, eine höchst <strong>individuelle</strong> «<strong>Zeitspur</strong>», die <strong>dein optimalstes Wachstum</strong> ermöglicht. Das heisst, dass du zu dem wirst, was ganz tief in dir drinnen schlummert und nur darauf wartet, geweckt zu werden.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491610617/dsr6qzmuzkx02qsptoa8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Nicht jeder ist ein <strong>Picasso</strong>, ein <strong>Einstein</strong>, ... ein <strong>Elon Musk</strong> der mit seinen Teslas die Automobilbranche umkrempelt ... Aber wir sind <strong>zutiefst überzeugt</strong>, dass in jedem Menschen ein <strong>kreatives Potential</strong> steckt und nur die Entwicklung deines Potentials dir <strong>wahre Erfüllung</strong> und grosse Freude schenken wird.</p>
<p>Aber, wenn du dies hier liest, ist die Chance gross, dass du <strong>dein wahres Potential</strong> noch nicht wirklich lebst ...</p>
<p><strong>Die traurige Wahrheit</strong> ist, dass die meisten Menschen nach wie vor im Hamsterrad stecken und noch nicht wirklich zu leben begonnen haben.</p>
<p><strong>Doch damit ist jetzt Schluss !</strong> Denn mit unserer Crowdfunding Kampagne wollen wir die ehemalige <strong>Kult-Maya-Agenda</strong> für den deutschsprachigen Bereich wieder produzieren und möglichst vielen Menschen <strong>ein machtvolles Hilfsmittel </strong>in die Hand geben, dass dir <strong>jeden Tag</strong> <strong>wichtige Informationen und Inspirationen</strong> liefert um dich aus dem Käfig des materiellen Kapitalismus befreien zu können.</p>
<p><strong>Raus aus dem Hamsterrad - Hinein ins Leben !</strong><br/><br/><br/>Um dir diesen Schritt, Prozess oder, falls du mutig bist, Sprung einfacher zu machen, soll dich unsere «<strong>Zuvuya Agenda 2018</strong>» täglich inspirieren und animieren den Zauber deines individuellen Lebens wieder mehr Zeit und Raum  zu geben. Am einfachsten geht das mit der konsequenten Anwendung der  berühmten Zeit-Formel :<br/> </p>
<h2><strong>T x e = KUNST </strong></h2>
<p><i>natürliche <strong>Zeit</strong> x <strong>Energie</strong> = <strong>KUNST</strong></i><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493582878/rcteykxfyfzdxx9gcfy1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ob dus glaubst oder nicht, aber diese Formel ist unserer Meinung nach mächtiger als Einsteins Formel «<strong>E = mc2</strong>» ! Warum ? Erstens, weil sie ebenfalls eine <strong>universelle Formel</strong> ist, die im ganzen Universum gleichermassen gilt. <strong>Energie multipliziert mit Zeit ergibt immer KUNST</strong>.<br/><br/><strong><i>Oder hast du jemals einen hässlichen Sonnenuntergang gesehen ?</i></strong></span></p>
<p>Du brauchst nicht unbedingt zum Pinsel greifen zu  müssen, um diese Formel im Alltag anzuwenden. Du wirst dank unserer <strong>Zuvuya-Agenda</strong> jedoch lernen und erfahren, wie die zahlreichen <strong>kleineren</strong> und <strong>grösseren Wunder</strong> dein Leben bereichern werden. Du wirst immer mehr das Gefühl bekommen, dass du diese <strong>Magie</strong> mitverursachst, dass du der eigentliche <strong>Schöpfer deiner Realität bist</strong>, oder eben, <strong>dein eigener Künstler</strong> !<br/> </p>

Im 2009 sind wir damals mit einer <strong>Kleinauflage</strong> von 50 Exemplaren gestartet, welche meinen damaligen Künstler-Partner und mich schon ziemlich forderte.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Die nächste Auflage war bereits um etliches grösser und schliesslich versendeten wir in ganz Europa <strong>mehrere Hundert Maya-Agendas</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Doch unser Team kam rasch an sein <strong>Limit</strong>, denn wir hatten ja  noch Beruf, Familie und, ja, sogar noch Hobbies :-)</span></p>
<p><i><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Und ganz ehrlich, zuerst zu produzieren und dann verkaufen zu müssen ist ganz schön anstrengend !</span></strong></i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Daher möchten wir es diesmal umgekehrt angehen. Wir möchten genau so viele Agendas herstellen lassen, wie tatsächlich gewünscht/bestellt werden.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Da wir diesmal alle Register in Sachen Gestaltung (<strong>Golddruck</strong>, Prägungen, Buchzeichen, Fadenbindung, fester Umschlag, special Features, etc.) ziehen möchten um dir ein <strong>Juwel</strong> einer Agenda in die Hände überreichen zu können, benötigen wir ein <strong>Startkapital</strong>, um eine erste Kleinauflage produzieren zu können.</span></p>
<p>Der Druck einer Kleinauflage ist ziemlich aufwendig. Aber wir wollen in der Gestaltung und der Umsetzung <strong>keinen Abstrich</strong> machen müssen. Wir wollen, dass deine Hände zu vibrieren beginnen, sobald du unsere «<strong>Zuvuya Agenda 2018</strong>»  in den Händen hältst.</p>
<p>Und ja, für alle, die uns unterstützen, haben wir mehrere Geschenke auf Lager. Und natürlich sind die wichtigsten «Perks» diejenigen, die eine der zukünftigen «<strong>Zuvuya Agenda</strong>» beeinhalten, denn das ist <strong>unsere galaktische Mission</strong> !</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Galaktische Perks und jede Menge magischer Cacao</span><br/> </h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Als ich damals die ersten Maya-Agendas produzierte, war mein zentraler <strong>Brennstoff</strong> für jegliche Form von Kreativität und Kunst ... reine, <strong>schwarze Schokolade</strong> ... natürlich <strong>Bio+Fair</strong>, wir wollen schliesslich <strong>glückliche Serotonine</strong> für unseren Körper und Geist.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Doch vor knapp zwei Jahren hatten wir Besuch von einer richtigen «<strong>Cacao-Queen</strong>», die unser gemeinsames Abendessen mit einem <strong>flüssigen Dessert</strong> bereicherte.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Das Dessert war eine heisse Cacao, gemacht aus Mandelmilch und bester Cacao in Rohkost Qualität.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488927760/wgnl85jhu1a7minrzbpa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Es war Liebe auf den ersten Schluck ! </strong>Seit diesem Abend im 2015 zelebrieren meine Partnerin und ich die rohe Cacao und machen uns fast jeden Abend eine heisse Cacao, inzwischen nach unserem eigenen, <strong>magischen Rezept, das wir gerne mit euch teilen werden.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Und weil Cacao seinen Ursprung als «<strong>Göttergetränk</strong>» bei den Maya hat, enthalten etliche unserer Perks eine <strong>Kostprobe</strong> dieses Cacaos. Ob in Form von <strong>Nibs</strong> (gebrochene Cacaobohnen mit Kokosblütenzucker) oder als <strong>schmelzender Cacao</strong>, wir liefern dir eine Portion nach Hause, inklusive unserem<strong> Rezept «Xocolatl»</strong>, als <strong>Kalligraphie</strong> ausgedruckt auf <strong>Spezialpapier</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Für diejenigen, die sich bereits vor der Auslieferung der «<strong>Zuvuya Surf Agenda</strong>» mit den <strong>universellen Archetypen</strong> der Zeit (Siegels) beschäftigen möchten, gibt es einen Perk, der ein <strong>Memory</strong> mit den wichtigsten Informationen dazu enthält. Kinder lernen übrigens die 20 Zeichen der Zeit in Rekordzeit kennen :-)<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493583331/poykbzx0gralucntw1vv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p>Und dann gibt es natürlich noch ganz spezielle, <strong>kunstvolle Perks</strong>. Zum Beispiel ein individuelles «<strong>Maya Orakel</strong>» (basierend auf dem «<strong>Dreamspell</strong>» nach Dr. José Argüelles). Wenn ich dein galaktisches Geburtszeichen weiss, male ich dir dein Orakel mit <strong>Aquarellfarben</strong> auf wunderschönes Papier. Dazu gibt es einen Text, individuell für dein Geburtszeichen, damit du dein Geburtspotential besser erkennen und nutzen kannst.<br/><br/><br/>Wir haben ein flexibles Funding Ziel gewählt, weil wir so oder so mit einer Auflage beginnen wollen, unabhängig, wieviel Geld wir als Unterstützung erhalten werden. <br/> </p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ready . Steady ... floOow !</span><br/> </h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Um die Zeit bis Ende Jahr zu überbrücken, werden wir allen Interessierten zyklisch ein paar Informationshäppchen zukommen lassen, mit denen du bereits loslegen kannst. <strong>Berechne dein eigenes Geburts-Zeichen</strong>. <strong>Dekodiere</strong> die Menschen um dich herum ! <strong>Nutze die Tagesenergie</strong> für dich und deine Projekte ! <strong>Webe Zauberteppiche</strong>, auf denen du dann reisen kannst ...</span><br/><br/>Besuche dazu unsere <strong>Projektwebsite</strong> : <a href=""http://www.zuvuya-agenda.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zuvuya-agenda.ch</a> | Hier findest du das wichtigste in Kürze, ein <strong>e.Book</strong> zum downloaden oder sogar einen <strong>gratis Mini-Online Kurs</strong> über das <strong>Zuvuya-Surfen</strong>. </p>

<h3>Risiken &amp; Nebenwirkungen</h3> <p>Tja, was gibt es noch zu sagen ?</p>
<p>Unser Maya-Team hat, als wir die <strong>Maya-Agenda</strong> noch produzierten, hunderte von <strong>Rückmeldungen</strong> erhalten, <strong>fast ausschliesslich Positive</strong> und sogar einige, die uns zutiefst berührten. Denn etliche Menschen berichteten von <strong>unglaublichen Ereignissen</strong>, <strong>Begegnungen</strong>, <strong>Versöhnungen</strong> und zum Teil wurde von «<strong>lebensverändernden Entscheidungen</strong>» geschrieben. Jemand kündigte seinen Job und begab sich auf eine <strong>Weltreise</strong>, ... Ein anderer Mensch erkannte, dass er eigentlich nur noch <strong>Kunst</strong> machen wollte, inspiriert von der Zeit-Kunstformel !</p>
<p><strong>Änderungen können zum Teil auch Angst machen ! </strong>Wer kennt das nicht aus eigener Erfahrung. Aber mit unserer «<strong>Zuvuya Agenda 2018</strong>» hast du einen <strong>Kompass</strong> in der Hand, der dir weit im voraus die <strong>Energiewellen</strong> ankündigt und beschreibt, bevor sie uns ereilen werden ... Und wenn sie dann eintreffen, sind wir bereit, <strong>auf ihnen zu surfen</strong> und nicht von ihnen überrollt zu werden !</p>

<h3>MACH MIT ! Das einzig.art.ige kollektive Zeit°Experiment !</h3> <p>«<strong>The more - the merrier</strong>» heisst ein englisches Sprichwort. Darum unterstütze unsere Kampagne. Denn unsere «<strong>Zuvuya Agenda 2018</strong>» ist erst der Anfang ! Mittel- und Langfristig geht es um viel, viel mehr ... <i>Durch Synchronisationen finden Menschen zusammen, die zusammengehören</i> ... und wer am surfen ist hat überhaupt keine Lust, jemandem zu schaden oder in den Krieg zu ziehen. <i><strong>Wir sind hier, um unser Potential maximal zu entfalten und gemeinsam das Leben zu feiern !</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>Das ist die frohe Botschaft der kosmischen Maya !</strong> Sie wussten, dass eine <strong>anspruchsvolle Zeit</strong> auf uns zukommen würde. Aber sie haben uns ihr <strong>Wissen über die Magie der Zeit</strong> und ihrer Zyklen in Stein eingehauen überlassen.</p>
<p><i><strong>Sind wir bereit, dieses Erbe anzunehmen ?</strong></i></p>

<p>ENGLISH VERSION<br/><br/>Dear Visitor</p>
<p>We are creating once again a cult agenda, based on the wisdom of the mayas about the «laws of time», the time cycles and the famous «Time x Energie = ART» formula, which simply states, that every thought, word, feeling, movement of body, heart, mind is an expression of art.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people have lost sight about this simple truth. Millions are stucked in the hamsterwheel and ask themselves, where the f**** is the way out of this daily routine !</p>
<p>Although human consciousness is about to shift, never ever before in human history have such a huge amount of people, connected thru internet, engaged for a better world. And for our personal development we do yoga, meditation, conscious breathing and spend money for good projects.</p>
<p>But it looks, that something is still missing !</p>
<p>From a galactic perspective, which the mayas definitely had, we are still lost in «artificial time», made by watches, machines and other devices which pretend to «show» us the time ! But actually, they only show us - in the best case - the duration of time which has passed ... mostly not really used for our spiritual evolution but just for exchange of our very precious lifetime in order to get some money at the end of the month to pay the bills, taxes, food and ... hopefully some holidays, we need to recover from this modern fOrm of slavery.</p>
<p>But, the mayas knew - because they were Masters of Time (Traveling) - that every issue / problem, which we - as an individual or collective - do not solve, will return like a boOMerang, precisely orchestered by the the laws (cycles) of time.</p>
<p>So they knew, that around this time we live in - the change of era and prevailing of a new paradigm - we will have «some» nice problems ! Like wars, aggression, corruption in politics, business, enviromental destruction and many more ! </p>
<p>So they left their whole wisdom carved in stones in whole middle america, exactly to be discovered in the time we live in.</p>
<p>Our «Zuvuya Agenda» is based on their calendars, wisdom and our own years-long experiences as «time surfers«, or as we call it «zuvuya surfers» (explanation in the pitch video).</p>
<p>So please donate for our project and we guarantee you ONE year EXPERIENCE you never had before !</p>
<p>Our agenda gives you daily information how to seize the day optimally and how to unleash your own soul potential. But this is just the start. If you think that time-travel, quantum-jumping and dimensional-changes are possible, then you are just at the right place !</p>
<p>But first step first ! We need the 15'000$ for producing the first limited edition of our agenda. And even if the introduction text is written in german, the galactic maya signs are universal and talk to you anyway. And we will give you access for free online webinars from our friends from the foundation of the law of times.</p>
<p>So please JOIN our galactic mission to bring JOY, PEACE and EXCITEMENT back into the life of human beeings !</p>
<p>In this sense : in lak'ech | maya greeting - i am another you</p>
<p>u.r.s. jOsé | white electric wizard<br/><br/>If you need more information about the whole subject, please visit the «law of time foundation» website, where you even can book free online courses to transfOrm yourself and your perception of time !</p>

 Die Zeit erreicht mit der «Zuvuya Agenda 2018», welche auf dem Wissen der Maya basiert, im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes eine neue Dimension.
Der Surf deines Lebens wartet auf dich !
Wer die Zeichen der Zeit lesen und richtig interpretieren kann, surft auf ihren Wellen über jegliche Hindernisse hinweg. 
Seit über 14 Jahren surfe ich dank den magischen Kalendern der Maya auf den Wellen der Zeit. Das bedeutet nicht, dass ich keine Probleme mehr habe. Es bedeutet jedoch, immer mehr zum optimalen Zeit°Punkt am richtigen Ort zu sein, und damit gar keine Probleme mehr zu erschaffen oder sie in Rekordzeit lösen zu können. Alles nur Zufälle ... ?
Was wäre jedoch, wenn hinter all diesen «Zufällen» ein System steckt, das messerscharf und präzise für dich arbeitet, jedoch nur, wenn du die Spielregeln kennst und sie zu deinem Vorteil anwendest ?
Die Mayas waren Meister der Zeit und deren Zyklen, daher war es für sie ein Kinderspiel, Ereignisse «vorauszusagen», weil sie ganz einfach wussten, dass sich alles immer wieder und immer wieder wiederholt, nur stets auf einer höheren, weiter entwickelten Ebene.
Doch nicht nur die Mayas wussten davon, der berühmte Schweizer Psychologe C.G. Jung kam ebenfalls diesem Phänomen auf die Spur und nannte es schliesslich «Synchronizitäten». Und genau um das geht es hier !
Stell dir vor, es gibt für jeden Menschen einen optimalen Lebensplan, eine höchst individuelle «Zeitspur», die dein optimalstes Wachstum ermöglicht. Das heisst, dass du zu dem wirst, was ganz tief in dir drinnen schlummert und nur darauf wartet, geweckt zu werden.
Nicht jeder ist ein Picasso, ein Einstein, ... ein Elon Musk der mit seinen Teslas die Automobilbranche umkrempelt ... Aber wir sind zutiefst überzeugt, dass in jedem Menschen ein kreatives Potential steckt und nur die Entwicklung deines Potentials dir wahre Erfüllung und grosse Freude schenken wird.
Aber, wenn du dies hier liest, ist die Chance gross, dass du dein wahres Potential noch nicht wirklich lebst ...
Die traurige Wahrheit ist, dass die meisten Menschen nach wie vor im Hamsterrad stecken und noch nicht wirklich zu leben begonnen haben.
Doch damit ist jetzt Schluss ! Denn mit unserer Crowdfunding Kampagne wollen wir die ehemalige Kult-Maya-Agenda für den deutschsprachigen Bereich wieder produzieren und möglichst vielen Menschen ein machtvolles Hilfsmittel in die Hand geben, dass dir jeden Tag wichtige Informationen und Inspirationen liefert um dich aus dem Käfig des materiellen Kapitalismus befreien zu können.
Raus aus dem Hamsterrad - Hinein ins Leben !Um dir diesen Schritt, Prozess oder, falls du mutig bist, Sprung einfacher zu machen, soll dich unsere «Zuvuya Agenda 2018» täglich inspirieren und animieren den Zauber deines individuellen Lebens wieder mehr Zeit und Raum  zu geben. Am einfachsten geht das mit der konsequenten Anwendung der  berühmten Zeit-Formel : 
T x e = KUNST 
natürliche Zeit x Energie = KUNST
Ob dus glaubst oder nicht, aber diese Formel ist unserer Meinung nach mächtiger als Einsteins Formel «E = mc2» ! Warum ? Erstens, weil sie ebenfalls eine universelle Formel ist, die im ganzen Universum gleichermassen gilt. Energie multipliziert mit Zeit ergibt immer KUNST.Oder hast du jemals einen hässlichen Sonnenuntergang gesehen ?
Du brauchst nicht unbedingt zum Pinsel greifen zu  müssen, um diese Formel im Alltag anzuwenden. Du wirst dank unserer Zuvuya-Agenda jedoch lernen und erfahren, wie die zahlreichen kleineren und grösseren Wunder dein Leben bereichern werden. Du wirst immer mehr das Gefühl bekommen, dass du diese Magie mitverursachst, dass du der eigentliche Schöpfer deiner Realität bist, oder eben, dein eigener Künstler ! 
Bist du bereit für den Surf deines Lebens ?

 Was wir wollen und wozu wir deine Hilfe benötigen  Wenn man keinen grossen Verlag im Rücken hat, kein Werbebudget, etc. dann ist die Produktion, die Vermarktung und der Vertrieb einer Agenda bereits eine kleine Herkulesarbeit, das weiss ich inzwischen aus eigener Erfahrung. Im 2009 sind wir damals mit einer Kleinauflage von 50 Exemplaren gestartet, welche meinen damaligen Künstler-Partner und mich schon ziemlich forderte.
Die nächste Auflage war bereits um etliches grösser und schliesslich versendeten wir in ganz Europa mehrere Hundert Maya-Agendas.
Doch unser Team kam rasch an sein Limit, denn wir hatten ja  noch Beruf, Familie und, ja, sogar noch Hobbies :-)
Und ganz ehrlich, zuerst zu produzieren und dann verkaufen zu müssen ist ganz schön anstrengend !
Daher möchten wir es diesmal umgekehrt angehen. Wir möchten genau so viele Agendas herstellen lassen, wie tatsächlich gewünscht/bestellt werden.
Da wir diesmal alle Register in Sachen Gestaltung (Golddruck, Prägungen, Buchzeichen, Fadenbindung, fester Umschlag, special Features, etc.) ziehen möchten um dir ein Juwel einer Agenda in die Hände überreichen zu können, benötigen wir ein Startkapital, um eine erste Kleinauflage produzieren zu können.
Der Druck einer Kleinauflage ist ziemlich aufwendig. Aber wir wollen in der Gestaltung und der Umsetzung keinen Abstrich machen müssen. Wir wollen, dass deine Hände zu vibrieren beginnen, sobald du unsere «Zuvuya Agenda 2018»  in den Händen hältst.
Und ja, für alle, die uns unterstützen, haben wir mehrere Geschenke auf Lager. Und natürlich sind die wichtigsten «Perks» diejenigen, die eine der zukünftigen «Zuvuya Agenda» beeinhalten, denn das ist unsere galaktische Mission !
 

Galaktische Perks und jede Menge magischer Cacao 
Als ich damals die ersten Maya-Agendas produzierte, war mein zentraler Brennstoff für jegliche Form von Kreativität und Kunst ... reine, schwarze Schokolade ... natürlich Bio+Fair, wir wollen schliesslich glückliche Serotonine für unseren Körper und Geist.
Doch vor knapp zwei Jahren hatten wir Besuch von einer richtigen «Cacao-Queen», die unser gemeinsames Abendessen mit einem flüssigen Dessert bereicherte.
Das Dessert war eine heisse Cacao, gemacht aus Mandelmilch und bester Cacao in Rohkost Qualität.
Es war Liebe auf den ersten Schluck ! Seit diesem Abend im 2015 zelebrieren meine Partnerin und ich die rohe Cacao und machen uns fast jeden Abend eine heisse Cacao, inzwischen nach unserem eigenen, magischen Rezept, das wir gerne mit euch teilen werden.
Und weil Cacao seinen Ursprung als «Göttergetränk» bei den Maya hat, enthalten etliche unserer Perks eine Kostprobe dieses Cacaos. Ob in Form von Nibs (gebrochene Cacaobohnen mit Kokosblütenzucker) oder als schmelzender Cacao, wir liefern dir eine Portion nach Hause, inklusive unserem Rezept «Xocolatl», als Kalligraphie ausgedruckt auf Spezialpapier.
Für diejenigen, die sich bereits vor der Auslieferung der «Zuvuya Surf Agenda» mit den universellen Archetypen der Zeit (Siegels) beschäftigen möchten, gibt es einen Perk, der ein Memory mit den wichtigsten Informationen dazu enthält. Kinder lernen übrigens die 20 Zeichen der Zeit in Rekordzeit kennen :-)
Und dann gibt es natürlich noch ganz spezielle, kunstvolle Perks. Zum Beispiel ein individuelles «Maya Orakel» (basierend auf dem «Dreamspell» nach Dr. José Argüelles). Wenn ich dein galaktisches Geburtszeichen weiss, male ich dir dein Orakel mit Aquarellfarben auf wunderschönes Papier. Dazu gibt es einen Text, individuell für dein Geburtszeichen, damit du dein Geburtspotential besser erkennen und nutzen kannst.Wir haben ein flexibles Funding Ziel gewählt, weil wir so oder so mit einer Auflage beginnen wollen, unabhängig, wieviel Geld wir als Unterstützung erhalten werden.  


Ready . Steady ... floOow ! 
Um die Zeit bis Ende Jahr zu überbrücken, werden wir allen Interessierten zyklisch ein paar Informationshäppchen zukommen lassen, mit denen du bereits loslegen kannst. Berechne dein eigenes Geburts-Zeichen. Dekodiere die Menschen um dich herum ! Nutze die Tagesenergie für dich und deine Projekte ! Webe Zauberteppiche, auf denen du dann reisen kannst ...Besuche dazu unsere Projektwebsite : www.zuvuya-agenda.ch | Hier findest du das wichtigste in Kürze, ein e.Book zum downloaden oder sogar einen gratis Mini-Online Kurs über das Zuvuya-Surfen. 
 
Risiken & Nebenwirkungen Tja, was gibt es noch zu sagen ?
Unser Maya-Team hat, als wir die Maya-Agenda noch produzierten, hunderte von Rückmeldungen erhalten, fast ausschliesslich Positive und sogar einige, die uns zutiefst berührten. Denn etliche Menschen berichteten von unglaublichen Ereignissen, Begegnungen, Versöhnungen und zum Teil wurde von «lebensverändernden Entscheidungen» geschrieben. Jemand kündigte seinen Job und begab sich auf eine Weltreise, ... Ein anderer Mensch erkannte, dass er eigentlich nur noch Kunst machen wollte, inspiriert von der Zeit-Kunstformel !
Änderungen können zum Teil auch Angst machen ! Wer kennt das nicht aus eigener Erfahrung. Aber mit unserer «Zuvuya Agenda 2018» hast du einen Kompass in der Hand, der dir weit im voraus die Energiewellen ankündigt und beschreibt, bevor sie uns ereilen werden ... Und wenn sie dann eintreffen, sind wir bereit, auf ihnen zu surfen und nicht von ihnen überrollt zu werden !


 
MACH MIT ! Das einzig.art.ige kollektive Zeit°Experiment ! «The more - the merrier» heisst ein englisches Sprichwort. Darum unterstütze unsere Kampagne. Denn unsere «Zuvuya Agenda 2018» ist erst der Anfang ! Mittel- und Langfristig geht es um viel, viel mehr ... Durch Synchronisationen finden Menschen zusammen, die zusammengehören ... und wer am surfen ist hat überhaupt keine Lust, jemandem zu schaden oder in den Krieg zu ziehen. Wir sind hier, um unser Potential maximal zu entfalten und gemeinsam das Leben zu feiern !
Das ist die frohe Botschaft der kosmischen Maya ! Sie wussten, dass eine anspruchsvolle Zeit auf uns zukommen würde. Aber sie haben uns ihr Wissen über die Magie der Zeit und ihrer Zyklen in Stein eingehauen überlassen.
Sind wir bereit, dieses Erbe anzunehmen ?
Sprich mit deinen Freunden darüber ! Erzähl ihnen von unserem «Zeitexperiment» bei dem jeder mitmachen und nur gewinnen kann. 
Wir danken dir aus tiefstem Herzen und sagen :

*****************************************************************************
ENGLISH VERSIONDear Visitor
We are creating once again a cult agenda, based on the wisdom of the mayas about the «laws of time», the time cycles and the famous «Time x Energie = ART» formula, which simply states, that every thought, word, feeling, movement of body, heart, mind is an expression of art.
Unfortunately, a lot of people have lost sight about this simple truth. Millions are stucked in the hamsterwheel and ask themselves, where the f**** is the way out of this daily routine !
Although human consciousness is about to shift, never ever before in human history have such a huge amount of people, connected thru internet, engaged for a better world. And for our personal development we do yoga, meditation, conscious breathing and spend money for good projects.
But it looks, that something is still missing !
From a galactic perspective, which the mayas definitely had, we are still lost in «artificial time», made by watches, machines and other devices which pretend to «show» us the time ! But actually, they only show us - in the best case - the duration of time which has passed ... mostly not really used for our spiritual evolution but just for exchange of our very precious lifetime in order to get some money at the end of the month to pay the bills, taxes, food and ... hopefully some holidays, we need to recover from this modern fOrm of slavery.
But, the mayas knew - because they were Masters of Time (Traveling) - that every issue / problem, which we - as an individual or collective - do not solve, will return like a boOMerang, precisely orchestered by the the laws (cycles) of time.
So they knew, that around this time we live in - the change of era and prevailing of a new paradigm - we will have «some» nice problems ! Like wars, aggression, corruption in politics, business, enviromental destruction and many more ! 
So they left their whole wisdom carved in stones in whole middle america, exactly to be discovered in the time we live in.
Our «Zuvuya Agenda» is based on their calendars, wisdom and our own years-long experiences as «time surfers«, or as we call it «zuvuya surfers» (explanation in the pitch video).
So please donate for our project and we guarantee you ONE year EXPERIENCE you never had before !
Our agenda gives you daily information how to seize the day optimally and how to unleash your own soul potential. But this is just the start. If you think that time-travel, quantum-jumping and dimensional-changes are possible, then you are just at the right place !
But first step first ! We need the 15'000$ for producing the first limited edition of our agenda. And even if the introduction text is written in german, the galactic maya signs are universal and talk to you anyway. And we will give you access for free online webinars from our friends from the foundation of the law of times.
So please JOIN our galactic mission to bring JOY, PEACE and EXCITEMENT back into the life of human beeings !
In this sense : in lak'ech | maya greeting - i am another you
u.r.s. jOsé | white electric wizardIf you need more information about the whole subject, please visit the «law of time foundation» website, where you even can book free online courses to transfOrm yourself and your perception of time !

I know, it’s a notebook, but it really is so much more..it’s structure is super helpful in daily & long term planning. Helps me break down projects into manageable steps and it reminds me to balance my professional & personal life.. & I’m even able to look back & be proud of accomplishments.. try it, I’m glad I did!- CCThe impact the notebook created on my daily schedule exceeded my expectation! It aids in strategizing my daily tasks and targeting the important ones, creating the connection between these tasks and my long-term goals.- Isadora Duncan STEP 1: PLAN.
Plan your ""BIG BLOCK"" goals for the next two-week cycle. 
A “BIG BLOCK” is a personal or professional task or goal requiring more than one day to complete, and can be broken down into a few daily tasks.
 STEP 2: ACT.
Add to your daily task manager a few small tasks that will get you closer to finishing A ""BIG BLOCK"" task.
Then, add all your other tasks to the daily task manager according to their priority. 
Now, act and complete your tasks.
 STEP 3: MONITOR. Cross completed tasks in the daily task manager and mark your progress in the ""BIG BLOCKS"" dashboard, and gain a visual graph of your focus for the period. STEP 4: REFLECT. At the end of a cycle, use the REFLECTION page to learn how you can improve your next cycle.
Did you achieve your goals or not?
If yes, how will you maintain them? If no, how can you improve?
Why didn't you achieve your goals?

But for frequent travelers and people who need to work remotely very often, it is almost impossible to bring the bulky stand with you. Until now, introducing Tesmo Kickstand, the world’s smallest invisible and portable adhesive laptop stand.  With only 0.6 oz(17g), Tesmo Kickstand is the world’s smallest invisible laptop stand. Tesmo Kickstand is strong and durable that can hold up to 17.6lbs of weight. Attaching and removing are both incredibly easy, and it won’t leave any residue on the surface, making it easily the world’s best invisible Laptop Stand.  Tesmo Kickstand is simple and only takes One Second to open and close it. You will not become frustrated spending much time on packing and unpacking the device. With Tesmo Kickstand, efficiency is guaranteed.   Low screen positioning and fixed keyboard of a laptop force users into awkward postures, causing neck-and-shoulder pain and diminished comfort. With Tesmo Kickstand, you can have a healthier posture when working remotely.  Adjust the position where you attach Tesmo Kickstand, you'll get the different angles. Even better, because the size of Tesmo is quite small, which ensures that it won’t cover your laptop fan vent. If you often travel with your laptop and like to retain your body’s posture, Tesmo kickstand definitely helps without adding extra bulk.   We all love a stand when working on a laptop, but it is close to impossible to bring it with you on-the-go, due to how bulky and heavy traditional stand is. But with Tesmo Kickstand, stick them to the bottom of your laptop, you won’t even feel anything!   Constructed with PU material, Tesmo is lightweight yet sturdy. It allows you to hold up to 17.6lbs, giving you ultimate stability and safety. The unmatched adhesive material allows you to conveniently attach and detach it from your laptop without leaving a single mark.  Tesmo Kickstand can be used not only on laptops but also on tablets and mobile phones. Simply, tear off the protective film and attach it to the back of your device. The perfect viewing experience is granted as your hands are set free.   Thanks to Tesmo Kickstand's special glue, it's not only durable and strong, but you can also detach and leave no residue on the surface, and re-attach Tesmo Kickstand with the same strong effectiveness.

<p><span>From there, I went to work for Apple for many years, first as a Regional Sales Manager and then joining the Retail division as a Senior Manager in launching a B2B sales strategy.  Last year, I decided to do something that combines my personal interests (reading, magazines, fashion &amp; beauty) with my technology background.</span></p>
<p><span>ShopthisMag was born from my love of magazines and all the great images, products, articles and photography that goes into publishing them.  I still subscribe to dozens of print and digital versions and I pour through them regularly. The missing link is that I want to buy many of the items that I see, when I see them.  But what I found was that even the digital versions of the magazines don’t allow click through purchases.  And if they do, the link on the product will send you to another website and away from the magazine.  From there, it’s anyone guess where you will end up.  </span></p>
<p><span>I’ve done the research and it takes an average of 20 clicks from seeing something to ultimately buying it (and having to create a new username and password every time).  So the question is:</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Isn't the whole idea of advertising to get you interested in the product?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Don't advertisers want you to buy their products?</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Then why is it so hard? </em></strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span>                              Digital media is evolving.  </span></h3>
<h3><span>                               E-commerce is growing.  </span></h3>

<h3>What<strong> We Need &amp; What You Get</strong>
</h3>
<p><span>As you can imagine, creating an app has many costs associated with it. We've already done so much!  We've done the market research and development and we've created a beautiful newsstand prototype.  We have developers and designers that have created the foundation and documentation for the working beta version.</span></p>
<p><span>Now we need additional funding to help us continue to work on our beta version.  This will help provide for the expenses incurred for development.  We will bring on 4 publishers to test and tweak the backend of the app, develop the final newsstand and select merchants and distribution centers for the products we will sell through the magazines.  Your contribution will help us realize this goal!</span></p>
<p><span>We've put together an amazing list of perks for your contributions from $5 to $5000+.</span></p>
<p><span>Everyone who contributes receives a 3 month subscription to the newsstand when we launch.  And with each package, we have provided a generous coupon to shop the newstand when we launch!</span></p>

<h3><em><strong>                 What's this 400lb gorilla doing in the room?</strong></em></h3>
<p><span><em><strong> </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Print is Dead?   </strong></em><strong>NO WAY!</strong>  </span></p>
<p><span>While there may be a trend towards digital, there are still over 22,000 print magazine titles currently in circulation.  <em>And that's just in the US alone.</em>  That number is multiplied several times over when we go worldwide.  </span></p>
<p><em>Why do I mention this when we are building a digital newsstand?</em></p>
<p>At ShopthisMag, we believe by giving publishers a new revenue stream from sharing in the profits of the products sold through their titles, print magazines will continue to inspire their digital sisters.  We don't want to put anyone out of work.  We want to inspire MORE beautiful, creative publications that everyone can enjoy for years to come.</p>
<p><span>We want to continue to be awed by the work photographers, writers, designers, advertisers and publishers put into publishing a single title every month, whether it's in print or digital.</span></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Frankly, </strong></em><em><strong>we firmly believe:</strong></em><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>It’s a </strong></em><em><strong>WIN-WIN-WIN-WIN for everyone!</strong></em></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Publishers:</em></strong>  Share in the revenue on items that are sold through their titles; a revenue stream that does not exist for them today.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Advertisers:</em></strong>  See their ad dollars receive an ROI they’ve never been able to see before.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Merchants:</em></strong>  Benefit from increased sales since purchases will be made at the time consumers are most compelled to buy -- when they see it!  </span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>YOU:</em></strong>  Get a huge selection of magazines for one low price AND you get to shop instantly.  Think of how much time you’ll save by letting us make it easy for you to buy what you want, when you want it.  And we’re saving the planet, no more wasting gas as you go from store to store trying to find what is right there for you to TAP and BUY.</span></p>
<p>Our goal is to have at least 50 magazines on the newsstand at launch and to have at least 10-25% of the magazine pages shop-able. And by Publishers partnering with us to make the pages in their magazines shop-able, it will incentivize their readers to buy and stay connected to the magazine for longer periods of time.</p>

<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p><strong><em>What is Shop this Magazine?</em></strong></p>
<p>ShopThisMag<sup>TM</sup> is IMAGE RETAIL<sup>TM</sup> a pay-one-price e-commerce newsstand (APP) that allows consumers to shop digital ads and images in a single source marketplace.  Every magazine title becomes its own department store by digitizing the products into shop-able items and creating a new shared merchant and publisher revenue stream.</p>
<p>We call it IMAGE RETAIL™, and believe it will become a whole new retail category which refers to ""shop this image"", ""buy this look"" and/or ""buy what's in this picture"", etc.  It further represents a future phase of our APP allowing you to point and click at a page in a ShopthisMag publication with a digital fingerprint that will immediately allow you to shop that page.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p><strong><em>What niche or void does Shop this Magazine fill?</em></strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">There is no easy way to purchase products and services that are advertised in printed or digital publications.  While publishers search for ways to stay profitable, many popular titles are redesigned for the APP or web versions and often do not resemble what is seen in the print issue.  While the APPs allow for expanded content and interactivity, none have made an easy interface for consumers to acquire the products that are advertised and the immediate purchase desire by the consumer is lost.</p>
<p>See it.  ShopIT Now</p>
<p>Subscribers and readers of print or digital magazines can easily purchase items they see and want in one easy convenient shopping environment.  By shopping their favorite magazines through the ShopthisMag newsstand, it will also provide advertisers and brands a reason to continue to advertise and learn which publications initiate sales for them.  Online magazines benefit from selling items from advertisers they already have as opposed to selling more advertising boxes per web page.   Publishers earn money from a new revenue source by sharing profits generated by the products sold through their titles.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p><strong><em>How does it work?</em></strong></p>
<p>Every magazine, every issue, becomes its own digital department store. Magazines will serve the purpose they were intended to serve … Sell products!   This will create a new revenue stream for the publisher and the merchant from the well created, beautiful and artistic ads for the products that are on every page in a way that doesn't exist today.   Additionally, we aim to provide invaluable data on what consumers are purchasing, where their purchases were made from, what their spending thresholds are and what can be done to create greater incentives to prompt their spending interests.</p>
<p>Each month publishers provide their magazine content to ShopthisMag.  Publishers are asked to provide any additional shopping information for its ads and pages that are not already provided for in the shopping guide.  STM then digitizes the content to make each image on each page into an interactive shop-able environment (turning on ShopITs).  Any item that has shopping information is able to be sourced and purchased by a consumer by pinning the item onto their STM ShopIT Board (aka shopping cart).  The items can all be purchased through STM, with one-time username and password creation and will not be redirected to other websites for multiple item purchases (similar to Amazon.com).  Users can also share their STM ShopIT Board on Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter and other social networking sites.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why would a Publisher want to be a part of ShopthisMag?</em></strong></p>
<p>Publishers are already familiar with third-party newsstand apps and websites and are comfortable licensing/providing them with the ability to offer subscription services to consumers in order to increase their subscriber and readership base.  By partnering with ShopthisMag, they increase their subscriber base AND reap the benefit of a <strong>brand new, untapped revenue source</strong> by earning commissions on any items sold through STM from their publications.  The more items the publishers can provide shopping information for, the more potential income can be made.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s in it for the consumer and/or subscriber?</em></strong></p>
<p>Consumers have never before had the ability to instantly shop the magazine they’re reading in this way.  Whether they are a subscriber or they pick up a magazine while at the doctor, airport, hair salon or even a conventional newsstand, any magazine cover that has the ShopthisMag logo can be shopped instantly either by scanning the logo with their smartphone or tablet, which opens up the Shop this Mag App to the magazine they are reading or by going to the Shop this Mag website and selecting the magazine from the newsstand.  Consumers are never asked to sign up until they want to make a purchase.  By using the Shop this Mag newsstand, they have the ability to peruse magazines they like and make purchases across multiple magazines.  By shopping their favorite magazines with Shop this Mag, they will benefit by paying one subscription fee for all the magazines in the Shop this Mag library, getting incredible member discounts and taking advantage of all the special offers they will be entitled too.  The monthly subscription fee for the Shop this Mag newsstand is waived for any month a purchase over $200.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s the difference between Shop this Magazine and other magazine apps?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are no other magazine apps that provide the ability to shop the entire magazine the way that Shop this Mag does.   Most apps, websites and digital magazine newsstands or subscriber services only offer subscription services.  At best, the recent QR codes that have become popular offer item specific content or redirect to a manufacturer website, contest, image, Facebook page, etc.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Who is Shop this Magazine’s competition?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are several digital publishing companies that offer subscription services or templates to upload magazine content to create a magazine app. Some digital publishers include Apple’s Newsstand, Zinio, ZMags, NextIssue, Maz Digital.  Many publishers also provide their own digital versions of their magazines which are either pay per issue, monthly subscription or are provided free if you are also a print subscriber. There are <strong>no direct competitors</strong> that provide single site eCommerce for magazine ads and images like Shop this Mag. </p>
<p><strong><em>How does Shop this Magazine make money?</em></strong></p>
<p>ShopthisMag will earn money on subscriptions and will take a % of each item sold through the Shop this Mag ShopIT board.  When users share their ShopIT Board across other social media sites, their network of followers will be introduced to the ShopthisMag newsstand and will spur new subscribers/shoppers.</p>
<p>There are many revenue streams: 1) Consumer Subscription Fees 2) Products Purchased by Consumers 3) Downloaded Issues  4) Publisher Featured Magazines 5) Publisher Data Reporting 6) Advertiser Data Reporting 7) Merchant Data Reporting</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s the potential?</em></strong></p>
<p>The potential is virtually untapped at present.  There are currently over 22,000 print publications in the United States alone.   Even presuming these are all monthly (some are weekly, bi-weekly or bi-monthly), that’s 264,000 unique issues per year. By making a publication shop-able, each magazine becomes its own department store.   A magazine with a circulation of 100,000 would reap the benefits of 100,000 potential subscribers purchasing just one item.  <strong>Each subscriber is a potential shopper.</strong>  And isn’t that why advertisers advertise in the first place?  By allowing readership in the ShopthisMag newsstand before requiring a subscription fee to be charged, the number becomes exponentially larger. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
ShopthisMag is a one-of-a-kind digital newsstand app that features all of your favorite magazine titles in one beautiful, easy to use App.  There's no need to manage multiple subscriptions and apps anymore.
What makes our newsstand exciting is that each magazine is its own beautiful department store.  We call it ImageRetail™.  Select a magazine, turn on ShopIts, and the images come to life.  When you see something you like, tap it and add it your ShopItBoard or just SaveIt for later, keep reading or browsing the magazines until you’re ready to checkout.  It all happens right there within the app!  
Browse the newsstand for free for the first 30 days.  After that, you pay one low monthly price to subscribe to all of the magazines on our newsstand, but any months that you make a purchase over $200, the subscription price is credited back to you!
We've got a Prototype, Executive Summary, Term Sheet for Investors, Prezi and Video Pitch available to view.  Please email teresa@shopthismag.com if you'd like to learn more.

A little background
Hi, my name is Teresa Rivera and I am the founder of ShopthisMag.  I was the first woman to own and run a computer retail store in NYC starting back in the early 1990s called ""the little computer store"".  I successfully sold my store to a local mac service shop and helped them build the largest single location computer retail store in the US (view my LinkedIn profile at http://www.linkedin.com/pub/teresa-rivera/11/416/5b3).
From there, I went to work for Apple for many years, first as a Regional Sales Manager and then joining the Retail division as a Senior Manager in launching a B2B sales strategy.  Last year, I decided to do something that combines my personal interests (reading, magazines, fashion & beauty) with my technology background.
ShopthisMag was born from my love of magazines and all the great images, products, articles and photography that goes into publishing them.  I still subscribe to dozens of print and digital versions and I pour through them regularly. The missing link is that I want to buy many of the items that I see, when I see them.  But what I found was that even the digital versions of the magazines don’t allow click through purchases.  And if they do, the link on the product will send you to another website and away from the magazine.  From there, it’s anyone guess where you will end up.  
I’ve done the research and it takes an average of 20 clicks from seeing something to ultimately buying it (and having to create a new username and password every time).  So the question is:
Isn't the whole idea of advertising to get you interested in the product?
Don't advertisers want you to buy their products?
Then why is it so hard? 
 
                              Digital media is evolving.  
                               E-commerce is growing.  
                              It's time ... ShopthisMag.
 
 
 
The ShopthisMag App
In this fast paced technology world, we can have practically anything we want at our fingertips.  Our phones, iPads and computers give us the ability to have anything we see on our screens with a single tap and click.  With that in mind, we’re building a little something that's missing in that equation:
 
                                By creating the first digital newsstand 
                            that lets you shop the magazines you read
 

 
 
What We Need & What You Get

As you can imagine, creating an app has many costs associated with it. We've already done so much!  We've done the market research and development and we've created a beautiful newsstand prototype.  We have developers and designers that have created the foundation and documentation for the working beta version.
Now we need additional funding to help us continue to work on our beta version.  This will help provide for the expenses incurred for development.  We will bring on 4 publishers to test and tweak the backend of the app, develop the final newsstand and select merchants and distribution centers for the products we will sell through the magazines.  Your contribution will help us realize this goal!
We've put together an amazing list of perks for your contributions from $5 to $5000+.
Everyone who contributes receives a 3 month subscription to the newsstand when we launch.  And with each package, we have provided a generous coupon to shop the newstand when we launch!

The Impact
 
                 What's this 400lb gorilla doing in the room?
 
Print is Dead?   NO WAY!  
While there may be a trend towards digital, there are still over 22,000 print magazine titles currently in circulation.  And that's just in the US alone.  That number is multiplied several times over when we go worldwide.  
Why do I mention this when we are building a digital newsstand?
At ShopthisMag, we believe by giving publishers a new revenue stream from sharing in the profits of the products sold through their titles, print magazines will continue to inspire their digital sisters.  We don't want to put anyone out of work.  We want to inspire MORE beautiful, creative publications that everyone can enjoy for years to come.
We want to continue to be awed by the work photographers, writers, designers, advertisers and publishers put into publishing a single title every month, whether it's in print or digital.
 
Frankly, we firmly believe:
 

It’s a WIN-WIN-WIN-WIN for everyone!
Publishers:  Share in the revenue on items that are sold through their titles; a revenue stream that does not exist for them today.
Advertisers:  See their ad dollars receive an ROI they’ve never been able to see before.
Merchants:  Benefit from increased sales since purchases will be made at the time consumers are most compelled to buy -- when they see it!  
YOU:  Get a huge selection of magazines for one low price AND you get to shop instantly.  Think of how much time you’ll save by letting us make it easy for you to buy what you want, when you want it.  And we’re saving the planet, no more wasting gas as you go from store to store trying to find what is right there for you to TAP and BUY.
Our goal is to have at least 50 magazines on the newsstand at launch and to have at least 10-25% of the magazine pages shop-able. And by Publishers partnering with us to make the pages in their magazines shop-able, it will incentivize their readers to buy and stay connected to the magazine for longer periods of time.

By making a publication shop-able, each magazine becomes its own department store.   A magazine with a circulation of 100,000 would reap the benefits of 100,000 potential subscribers purchasing just one item.  Each subscriber is a potential shopper.  And isn’t that why advertisers advertise in the first place?  By allowing readership in the ShopthisMag newsstand before requiring a subscription fee to be charged, the number becomes exponentially larger.

Here you need to choose one favorite sport club and the matches you are planning to visit. After verification of all his data, the service receives a special card. This card will have the whole information about the e-tickets you’ve bought. Also there is a possibility to buy a subscription for all games in a season. The Ralok card - special card with the screen and buttons. Users will be able to attend matches of other sports clubs and tennis tournaments, which cooperate with the company Ralok. </p><p><strong>2.</strong> To buy an electronic ticket the user first of all need to visit the website of our service (or to use the mobile application). Then he need to select most suitable for him seat in the electronic version of the stadium and to pay for it. He can pay in three ways by means of bank card, in the bank or to use a special terminal near the stadium. Also there is a ""free e-ticket"" function. The user can book the e-ticket and to pay for it later. This function will be available only one time in 90 days. Until he pays for this e-ticket he won't be able to get a new one.  </p><p><strong>3.</strong> In case if you can’t visit the forthcoming match you still can return the e-ticket back to the system not less than in 20 minutes before the game. Then you can have all your money back. The price for tickets will change depending on the number of the remained e-tickets and time before an upcoming game. It will change from 0,5 to 1(dollar, euro, pound, depending on the country). </p><p><strong>4. </strong>You can buy only one e-ticket for one registered account. That’s why it’ll reduce the level of secondhand dealers. Also children can create their own accounts. But only parents could pay for their children’s e-tickets.  </p><p><strong>5.</strong> When the user visits the website and chooses the necessary match, there will be opened the electronic version of stadium. Here the user can check the number of available seats and how many e-tickets are already sold. Also he will see where is his seat is exactly situated in the stadium.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> There will be a function on the website like ""Transfer the e-ticket"". There the user will be able to send one already bought e-ticket to his friend, girlfriend, relative and etc.  </p><p><strong>7.</strong> Not to overload the system there will be created the electronic queue for viewing and purchase the e-ticket for a certain match. The period of waiting in a queue will be 90-120 seconds.  </p><p><strong>8.</strong> To get to the stadium the person will need to insert the card into a special turnstile. Then after computer authorization he will be able to get into the stadium. On the screen of the card it will be highlighted (sector, a row and seat). In a mobile application, the user will be able to see a route to the place at stadium.  </p><p><strong>9.</strong> As soon as the person gets into the stadium he will be already marked as ""I’m here"" on the website.  </p><p><strong>10.</strong> After the game in the mobile application or in the account on the website there will be appeared some buttons for the evaluation of the service, match and players.

It is possible to find a large number of regular websites where it is possible to purchase the e-ticket for some sport matches. But you need to pay the commission to this website and to print out the ticket then. If there is no opportunity to unpack it, the person should take it in the office or to order the delivery. Usually the same websites are small and with limited number of options. The main aim of Ralok team is to create the biggest platform for purchasing e-tickets. There are no analogs of the same smart card where electronic tickets will be enlisted. It's clear that not all clubs will show directly desire to cooperate with a new system.

First step is to register in our service. Here you need to choose one favorite sport club and the matches you are planning to visit. After verification of all his data, the service receives a special card. This card will have the whole information about the e-tickets you’ve bought. Also there is a possibility to buy a subscription for all games in a season. The Ralok card - special card with the screen and buttons. Users will be able to attend matches of other sports clubs and tennis tournaments, which cooperate with the company Ralok. 2. To buy an electronic ticket the user first of all need to visit the website of our service (or to use the mobile application). Then he need to select most suitable for him seat in the electronic version of the stadium and to pay for it. He can pay in three ways by means of bank card, in the bank or to use a special terminal near the stadium. Also there is a ""free e-ticket"" function. The user can book the e-ticket and to pay for it later. This function will be available only one time in 90 days. Until he pays for this e-ticket he won't be able to get a new one.  3. In case if you can’t visit the forthcoming match you still can return the e-ticket back to the system not less than in 20 minutes before the game. Then you can have all your money back. The price for tickets will change depending on the number of the remained e-tickets and time before an upcoming game. It will change from 0,5 to 1(dollar, euro, pound, depending on the country). 4. You can buy only one e-ticket for one registered account. That’s why it’ll reduce the level of secondhand dealers. Also children can create their own accounts. But only parents could pay for their children’s e-tickets.  5. When the user visits the website and chooses the necessary match, there will be opened the electronic version of stadium. Here the user can check the number of available seats and how many e-tickets are already sold. Also he will see where is his seat is exactly situated in the stadium.6. There will be a function on the website like ""Transfer the e-ticket"". There the user will be able to send one already bought e-ticket to his friend, girlfriend, relative and etc.  7.

To get to the stadium the person will need to insert the card into a special turnstile. Then after computer authorization he will be able to get into the stadium. On the screen of the card it will be highlighted (sector, a row and seat). In a mobile application, the user will be able to see a route to the place at stadium.  9. As soon as the person gets into the stadium he will be already marked as ""I’m here"" on the website.  10. After the game in the mobile application or in the account on the website there will be appeared some buttons for the evaluation of the service, match and players. Moreover, he will be able to leave a comment.It is the special interactive card where the fan will purchase all the electronic tickets. There is a screen and buttons on the smart card. Data is transferred there by Bluetooth. Within the card a person will be able to see the time a sector, a row and the address of the upcoming sport event. After passing the registration via the Ralok’s service, the fan will receive the card whether by mail or by arriving to any sports club cooperating with the Ralok system. Here you can keep an unlimited number of e-tickets at the same time. Just choose the necessary options on the screen.All e-tickets and season e-tickets on one card.Only 4 actions further:1. Get in the Ralok service and choose the match of interest.2. Find for yourself the best seat.3. Pay for the e-ticket or use the ""free e-ticket"" function.4. Come to the stadium and attach the card to the special turnstile. 1. Great increase of home games attendance.  2. The comparative analysis and full statistic data from our service after each house game.  3. Regular survey of all users for the purpose of improving the work of the club.  4. Communication among fans.  5. High speed and convenience from using the service.  6. The prestige of club will be increasing because at first time there will be only 100 clubs in the system that’s why we will analyze each sport club before starting cooperation.  7. Constant draws, gifts and free e-tickets for users. It will involve even more people in the service.8. It is a social network and information resource where people can communicate and where they will be able to obtain the last information from the world of sport.  9. Ralok will be available to cooperate with services for food and drink delivery to the stadium or calling for a taxi to the stadium.10. Full automation of process.1.  Modern, convenient and quick service for purchasing electronic tickets.  2. The most convenient way from buying an e-ticket to attending the match.3. It is easy to use smart Ralok’s card and you do not need any paper tickets.4. It is easy to find the right place at the stadium.  5. Real participation in the life of a favorite club.  6. There is an opportunity to get free of charge to the sports match through Ralok lottery.  7. Social network where it is possible to get acquainted and communicate with the fans of a favorite team. Also you will have a feed where it will be possible to look through all the matches you’ve attended.

 Ralok’s system will start the cooperation with such sports as: soccer, hockey, basketball, tennis, american football as well as other sports. In future, our system will be able to used for buying public transport e-tickets and flights. Nowadays there are no analogs in the world. It is possible to find a large number of regular websites where it is possible to purchase the e-ticket for some sport matches. But you need to pay the commission to this website and to print out the ticket then. If there is no opportunity to unpack it, the person should take it in the office or to order the delivery. Usually the same websites are small and with limited number of options. The main aim of Ralok team is to create the biggest platform for purchasing e-tickets. There are no analogs of the same smart card where electronic tickets will be enlisted. It's clear that not all clubs will show directly desire to cooperate with a new system. It is clear that not all sports clubs will be ready to cooperate with us in the beginning.  But the main idea is to find the first clients and then we believe the clients’ base will rapidly expand.  You can visualize your e-ticket immediately after purchase, using a mobile phone or at the entrance to the stadium, putting smart card to a special passing turnstile.Each week our company will produce a drawing of two e-tickets to the local matches with the clubs that are cooperated with our base. By randomly selecting numbers we will determine the winner. Only users who bought the ticket the previous week can take part in the competition. Our employees will contact them and send them 2 free e-tickets to the game, as well as a one-way flight (if necessary) Each week the site will publish an article about the winners, with the interview and a photo report.Usually they decide to make an empty sector between all the guest fans and the home fans. We suggest to create a special partition. That will help us to fill the stadium with more guests and at the same time the security level will be very high.  Conditions to start a cooperation with the system: The price of each purchased e-ticket we will add 1 (dollar, euro, pound, depending on the country), to the price of 1 match according to the subscription 0.7 (it is our income). One year of collaboration doesn't mean that people will be able to buy an e-tickets only via Ralok system. There also will be available the usual way of purchasing the tickets. But we believe that thanks to our strong marketing campaign people will understand that using Ralok is rather more convenient and easier.    In 2 seasons of our joint operation when 99% of fans will pass to use the Ralok’s service, we will compensate the club with the cost of all blank spaces at stadium. You can find a lot of small and inconvenient websites in the Internet where it is possible to buy a ticket for a sports game. But if you ask: ""Tell me the largest and coolest service where it is possible to buy a ticket without any problems,"" it won’t tell you anything. That’s all because of not our platform being in the Internet. The aim of our project is proudly responded: ""Use Ralok!"" And then everybody could attend the match of their favorite team. 3 hours before the game, each person who bought a e-ticket for the match, receive a notification via both SMS and email. Here will be the information of the upcoming match and also there will be a question whether he or she will attend the match. People who bought an e-ticket in less than 3 hours before the start of the game will receive a notification in a few minutes after purchasing.Possible answers:1111 - Yes2222- No3333 - No, but his friend want to attend the match with his card. Otherwise, we will offer these e-ticket to someone else.In cases where the person response 2222, we would have the right to reapply an e-ticket for sale one more time. If the user answers 1111 or 3333, these places in the stadium will still be blank. If it happens 3 times in a row he will be denied to access the stadium for a certain number of matches.Near the stadium there will be special terminals where the user can use the Internet and buy an e-ticket.   We will also have a mobile app. Via GPS system the application will be able to route you to the stadium. You shouldn't look for the place any more or to ask volunteers how to get to the stadium. Also, you can find your friends in the crowd at the stadium.If we are talking about nature resources we need to remember that for printing tickets for one match for 15 thousand fans we kill one tree!Let's save nature together. Tag #RalokSaveNature to be featured!Q: Where I can get the smart card?A: You can get it in the nearest sports club, which collaborates with us. Also you can get it in Ralok’s service-center, or to order delivery. Q: How much does the issue of the card cost?   A: Approximately 50-60$.Q: Does the fan need to pay the whole cost of the card?   A: No, fans will have their cards for free. We will negotiate with the clubs for going fifty-fifty costs (50% will pay Ralok, 50% will pay the club). In the first year.   Q: If I forgot my card at home I won’t be able to get to the stadium? A: Absolutely no. He can receive his ticket via mobile app either.   Q: What will be if I lost or broke the card?   A: If you damaged the card heavily we will reestablish your card for free. But if you lost it you would need to reestablish it for the whole price. Q: If someone stole my card whether he would have a possibility to use my personal data?А: No, each card has its own password and only the owner knows this password. But do not forget to write to the Ralok’s service for blocking the stolen card.Q: Are you planning to implement your system to some tennis matches? Who will refund the costs then?A: As we told you earlier when you will be sing up in the system there will be a possibility to choose your favorite team. According to tennis, you will choose your favorite player. Of course, the players won’t refund the half of the card’s price. These questions will be discussed with the management of each tennis competition.  Q: What is the commission rate? How it will be counted?  A: We will add one more $, €, £ to the final price according to the country where the ticket was bought. If you have a season e-ticket then you will have a commission of 0,7  $, €, £ per e-ticket.Q: The Ralok platform will be integrated only in the sports events or we will have a possibility to use it in other spheres?  A: For the beginning we are thinking only about sports events. But as for long-term period we are planning to integrate it with other spheres. We think that this card will help us to economize the nature resources. Just imagine, with our card you won’t be able to print the tickets anymore!

<h3>Reagan Chat is for people that appreciate their privacy, period.</h3>
<p>We love the Internet, social networks and the power they give us for communicating, sharing and social interaction. </p>
<p>What we don’t love is that private communication has turned into an open stream for companies and liberal organizations to listen to us and give the keys to our private lives and thoughts to the government.</p>
<p>Our fears are now confirmed, government and others are listening, harvesting our words, and measuring our sentiment. They are able to know were and when and at what time we are meeting and why. All for their purposes and not ours. No real need for polling, now the government and others have the tools and information they need instantaneously and we were allowing that to happen. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The leading companies in the digital, social media and cellular communications like; Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Verizon, ATT and others have been “forced” to open up their systems and hand out the keys to the servers that hold our information and our daily communications to the government. We just don't trust them!</p>
<h3>But I am not hiding anything!</h3>
<p>Well, that is true for most of us but when was the last time you had a private texting session with your friends, co-workers and loved-ones?  Why do they need to know this? All information could at one point be held against you. No need for that!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>When will Reagan Chat be released?</h3>
<p>We are planning to be live in August 2013.</p>
<h3>How much will the app cost?</h3>
<p>The application will cost  between $2.99 and $4.99. We may charge a small fee (via an in-app purchase) to fund more features and new releases. We do this to fund the continuing development of infrastructure, security and encryption software. We will never introduce ads or sell your data to fund the app or our operations.</p>
<h3>Why is Reagan Chat different from WassApp, MessageMe, iMessage, Skype, etc?</h3>
<p>Our focus is the privacy of Freedom-Loving Americans so we are building everything from private software and infrastructure owned by the company to protect our users.</p>
<h3>Where would the servers be located and who owns the servers?</h3>
<p>The best way to make the system secure is keep the infrastructure in private hands and as far from U.S. government control as possible. We own our servers and have strategically located them in undisclosed, secured locations where the Patriot Act does not have jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>What technology will Reagan Chat use?</h3>
<p>We are building Reagan Chat with proven technologies and programming languages, but with privacy, security and freedom as a first priority.</p>
<h3>Who created Reagan Chat?</h3>
<p>Reagan Chat is being created by the same people that created and developed private email service @Reagan.com.</p>
<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<p>Back in 2006 we knew that companies like Google, Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft were implementing highly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems to read and analyze all email communications traveling in their networks.</p>
<p>The hyper growth of Smart Phones has now made Text Messaging the standard for almost every person in the US. Of course all of the companies mentioned above have upgraded their systems to read text messages and harvest your information.</p>
<p>We knew this and the leak from Edward Snowden made us speed up our development. We truly believe in our rights and the right to be private. Plus the fact that we don’t trust the government and the liberals using our information for their own purposes.</p>
<h3>But I am not a conservative, can I still contribute?</h3>
<p>Regardless of your political affiliation or ideology, you have the right to privacy. Again, it is not that you are doing something wrong or hiding something, it is your right to choose who can read your communications.  The Patriot Act was implemented under a time of crisis. It probably made some sense then but after almost 12 years or spying under republican and democrat administrations, the program has not produced any tangible results. Let's keep some privacy!</p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>We need your financial support. We have invested our own money in the initial development and purchase of the infrastructure behind the communications platform. As you know, it is not cheap to be great.  Please help us with your financial contribution and by telling everyone that you know!</p>

We have even tested the system to diagonal traverse rates exceeding 1,800 inches per minute! We literally had to slow the Mega V down to keep it from being “too fast”.  Just as importantly, the Mega V has the power to accelerate very quickly. It goes from a full stop to full rapid in a flash. With a maximum cutting rate of 500 inches per minute (12,700 mm/minute), the Mega V can cut more than twice as fast as some other machines can rapid traverse.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imgur.com/i1MpanP.gif"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""26399943""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><p>Whether you plan to cut wood, plastic, carbon fiber, aluminum, or other soft metals, the MillRight Mega V has the rigidity, speed, and precision to zip through your projects.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imgur.com/zTamjpv.gif"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""26399949""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><p>We've done a massive amount of work prior to the launch of this campaign to set us up for success.

The Mega V is the culmination of our years of experience as a CNC router manufacturer and embodies the founding vision of MillRight CNC: To create ""the best value in CNC."" The Mega V has been shaped by the feedback we've received from customers along the way. We are passionate about being at the forefront of the consumer CNC market by creating and delivering the most capable CNC machine you can get for the money.There are a lot of factors that make the Mega V superior to competing machines. Our huge, custom aluminum extrusion is one of the most substantial ever used on a CNC machine at this price point. The bearing plates are precision cut from heavy duty 1/4” steel. These components are twice as thick as what many competitors use. This and all other footage is in real time.
 The Mega V’s oversized rollers are a huge advantage. They are 40mm (1.5”) in diameter, with larger bearings pressed in. This creates a wider contact patch than other machines with similar bearing systems. The Z axis uses high precision linear profile rail. All this together makes the Mega V a superbly rigid machine. We will gladly put the Mega V against any machine in its class in a rigidity test.  The structure and bearing system are only part of what makes the Mega V awesome. We have taken affordable CNC to the next level with a precision rack and pinion drive system, often only seen in more expensive CNC machines. The Z axis is driven by a lead screw and anti-backlash nut proven on another one of our models. We combined these premium features with high performance NEMA 23 motors with more than double the holding torque of some other machines in the class!  We marry these motors to large digital stepper motor drivers and a 48VDC power supply that maximizes the performance of the motors. The super rigid frame and premium drive system combine for unmatched performance. The Mega V rapid traverses at 650 inches per minute (16,510 mm/minute) on the X and Y axes, giving a diagonal traverse rate of almost 920 inches per minute (23,368mm/minute). We have even tested the system to diagonal traverse rates exceeding 1,800 inches per minute! We literally had to slow the Mega V down to keep it from being “too fast”.  Just as importantly, the Mega V has the power to accelerate very quickly. It goes from a full stop to full rapid in a flash. With a maximum cutting rate of 500 inches per minute (12,700 mm/minute), the Mega V can cut more than twice as fast as some other machines can rapid traverse.  Whether you plan to cut wood, plastic, carbon fiber, aluminum, or other soft metals, the MillRight Mega V has the rigidity, speed, and precision to zip through your projects.  We've done a massive amount of work prior to the launch of this campaign to set us up for success. The Mega V's many custom parts have been getting tested, redesigned, and refined for months.  We can make a lot of parts in our own manufacturing facility equipped with a production lathe, vertical machining center, waterjet, lasers, and other supporting equipment. We've already coordinated with suppliers for the parts that we can't make in house, like the Mega V's custom aluminum extrusion. We designed the profile, had the die manufactured, and got a local aluminum extruder to produce samples. We've even already negotiated production pricing. We just need your backing to put in the high volume order that will allow us to get the best possible pricing and pass those savings along to you.   Features like the optional 4th axis are quite uncommon for machines in this class. We've refined a multi-axis branch of Grbl and designed a custom breakout board to make the rotary axis possible. You can even rotary engrave with the optional laser.You'll love the optional 7 watt JTECH laser system with high resolution lens and protective shroud. The laser mounts magnetically and can be pulled on and off the machine easily. You can go from routing to laser engraving and back again in a flash.   The Mega V Plasma version has the same high performance characteristics as the router version. It adds high-end, sought after features often used on industrial plasma tables. The machine mounts right on top of a water table that we fabricate, weld, and powder coat for durability. A water table helps capture the nasty fumes created in the plasma cutting process, keeping your shop clear of the smoke clouds that would build up otherwise.

If you use a plasma unit without a CNC interface you must be prepared to splice into your unit's torch trigger to let the Mega V automatically control it. Contact your torch manufacturer for more information on integrating with a CNC machine.    Want to use one machine for plasma cutting and CNC routing? With the Mega V plasma version you can easily turn the plasma table into a router table in two simple steps. Make sure to include the Router Add-on and Router Table Adapter in your pledge to get the best of both worlds! Please note that the plasma version has the capability of being used as a CNC router, but not vice versa. Want to understand more about the options? See what's available using the pledge table below. To read the table, find the machine you selected at the top, then look for the optional accessory on the left. If the corresponding cell has ""n/a"" then that option is not available with that machine version.

The Pop 'N Go is the lightest, safest, and most convenient portable playpen in the world.

By using reinforced fiberglass framing, we were able to add a superior frame while making it up to 50% lighter than comparable products.

 
It's also built with a tightly woven durable weave-mesh around all sides for comfort and breathability, all while making this the strongest and longest lasting playpen on the market.

And our patented ""pop up"" and ""release"" technology allows setting it up and taking it down to happen in seconds and with minimal effort.

We also included a UV shade cover to protect your little ones from the sun.

As well as a self-inflating mattress for extra padding.

The Pop 'N Go measures 52 inches across the surface area of the playpen, and it's 41 inches high from the bottom to the top of the mesh netting, so even taller kids can play and stand comfortably inside.

The total weight is only 7.2 lbs., so carrying it around with you is a breeze! You'll want to take this with you everywhere for your little ones to enjoy - the beach, the park, hiking or camping, parties, events, and even just monkeying around in the house!

<p>Urban Survival Gear (USG) launched the TiScribe-Bolt (TS-Bolt) in early 2017. The integrated clip assembly solved a myriad of common bolt-action issues. We decided to make the TS-Bolt even better with Version 2.0! TS-Bolt Version 2.0 is <strong>ceramic coated for increased wear resistance</strong>. In addition, ceramic coating has a multitude of colors and patterns. Current colors/patterns are: black, orange, tan, green, blue, red, pink, black/red, black/green, desert camouflage, unicorn dust, arctic trooper, and black camouflage. </p>
<p><strong>Pledge any TiScribe-Bolt and get additional TiScribe-Bolts for the early bird price (see rewards for details).</strong></p>
<p>Version 2.0 is CNC machined from aerospace grade titanium. The clip screws <strong>are grade 5 titanium (Torx®)</strong> due to its fantastic strength-to-weight ratio. The Torx screws allow for greater fastening without stripping. <strong>These screws are more durable and half the weight!</strong></p>
<p><strong>USG is relocating to Texas</strong>. Funds from this campaign will be used to construct a 3200 ft² production facility. <strong>We need your help in funding the construction</strong>. In return, you'll get construction updates and a personal invite to the open-house in late 2019. </p>

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM: </strong>Backers have been asking for anodized versions of our pens. We resisted due to the drawbacks of anodizing, namely: </p>
<ul>
<li>Previous Issues Getting Consistent Shade/Color Between Batches</li>
<li>The Coating is VERY Thin thus Easily Removable via Wear</li>
<li>Chemicals Involved Deterred In-house Production</li>
<li>Prone to Fingerprinting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION:</strong> Cerakote®. Cerakote is a Polymer-Ceramic Composite coating. The unique formulation of the ceramic coating makes the titanium TS-Bolt <strong>EVEN MORE ABRASION/ WEAR RESISTANT</strong>. Ceramic is superior to anodizing for this application, here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>EXTREMELY Wear Resistant Please CLICK HERE&gt;  <a href=""https://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/testing/%C2%A0%C2%A0for"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/testing/&amp;nb...</a> Durability Test.</li>
<li>Consistent Colors/Shades Across Batches</li>
<li>More Patterns/Designs Available</li>
<li>Fingerprint Resistant</li>
<li>The coating work is outsourced to a Cerakote certified applicator. The applicator has processed thousands of objects in a myriad of colors and patterns. He does great work,</li>
</ul>
<p><i>FAST!</i></p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>What makes the TiScribe-Bolt unique is the bolt mechanism. The clip, bolt button, and bolt carrier are all integrated into one unit. This reduces the amount of moving parts and makes for a much more rigid assembly. The internals of each pen are also coated with ceramics.<strong> The ceramic coatings make the actuation even smoother. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541399608/fzzbecvlff4gehssgw06.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tip, cap, pen body, and clip are all CNC machined from titanium;<strong> EVEN THE SCREWS.</strong> Each screw is machined from Grade 5 Titanium with the Torx® fastening pattern. The Torx fastening pattern allows for greater torque without stripping. Prior screws were hex patterned stainless steel. The stainless screws would slightly deform during torqueing. <strong>The new titanium screws are more durable and are half the weight!</strong></p>
<p>The spring will remain stainless steel; here's why: 1. The titanium springs did not perform as well as the stainless steel, 2. Similar products reported the same issues when using titanium springs in their pens, 3. Costs were 3x more expensive. We owe it to our backers to provide them the best writing experience possible. The additional cost and performance drawbacks made stainless steel the better choice.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Externally, the Version 2.0 is identical to the Version 1.0. Internally, all diameters were increased to their MAXIMUM to accommodate more refills and additional tip stick-out.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We've produced thousands, yes thousands, of TiScribe-Bolt's (TS-Bolt) so far. The TS-Bolt Version 2 includes updates, but the machine code and tooling is nearly identical. Production is really plug-and-play at this point.</p>
<p>Will the TS-Bolt really take until December 2018 to ship? Probably not due to the reusable tooling. We've also expanded our capabilities by adding another CNC lathe to the shop. The new lathe cuts production time in HALF. At USG we don't stop cranking until the project is done!</p>
<p>100% of the machining is done at our facility in California. The ceramic coating is outsourced to a Cerakote® Certified Applicator. They do quality work, FAST! Suppliers/subcontractors have been notified about this project and are awaiting our orders. We're confident that your pledge will get to you on-time or EARLY.</p>

Version 2.0 is CNC machined from aerospace grade titanium. The clip screws are grade 5 titanium (Torx®) due to its fantastic strength-to-weight ratio. The Torx screws allow for greater fastening without stripping. These screws are more durable and half the weight!
USG is relocating to Texas. Funds from this campaign will be used to construct a 3200 ft² production facility. We need your help in funding the construction. In return, you'll get construction updates and a personal invite to the open-house in late 2019. 

THE PROBLEM: Backers have been asking for anodized versions of our pens. We resisted due to the drawbacks of anodizing, namely: 

Previous Issues Getting Consistent Shade/Color Between Batches
The Coating is VERY Thin thus Easily Removable via Wear
Chemicals Involved Deterred In-house Production
Prone to Fingerprinting

THE SOLUTION: Cerakote®. Cerakote is a Polymer-Ceramic Composite coating. The unique formulation of the ceramic coating makes the titanium TS-Bolt EVEN MORE ABRASION/ WEAR RESISTANT. Ceramic is superior to anodizing for this application, here's why:

EXTREMELY Wear Resistant Please CLICK HERE>  https://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/testing/&nb... Durability Test.
Consistent Colors/Shades Across Batches
More Patterns/Designs Available
Fingerprint Resistant
The coating work is outsourced to a Cerakote certified applicator. The applicator has processed thousands of objects in a myriad of colors and patterns. He does great work,

FAST!

 
What makes the TiScribe-Bolt unique is the bolt mechanism. The clip, bolt button, and bolt carrier are all integrated into one unit. This reduces the amount of moving parts and makes for a much more rigid assembly. The internals of each pen are also coated with ceramics. The ceramic coatings make the actuation even smoother. 
 

 
The tip, cap, pen body, and clip are all CNC machined from titanium; EVEN THE SCREWS. Each screw is machined from Grade 5 Titanium with the Torx® fastening pattern. The Torx fastening pattern allows for greater torque without stripping. Prior screws were hex patterned stainless steel. The stainless screws would slightly deform during torqueing. The new titanium screws are more durable and are half the weight!
The spring will remain stainless steel; here's why: 1. The titanium springs did not perform as well as the stainless steel, 2. Similar products reported the same issues when using titanium springs in their pens, 3. Costs were 3x more expensive. We owe it to our backers to provide them the best writing experience possible. The additional cost and performance drawbacks made stainless steel the better choice.

 
Externally, the Version 2.0 is identical to the Version 1.0. Internally, all diameters were increased to their MAXIMUM to accommodate more refills and additional tip stick-out.

In general, most refills that resemble the Pilot G2 will work with the TS-Bolt. A list of confirmed compatible refills are:      

Pilot G2 (Ships with Pledge)
Pentel Energel Series
Montblanc Rollerball
Parker Style Refills *
Uniball Jetstream
Uniball 207 Gel
Schmidt 5888
Pilot V5,V7 

* Parker Style refills require a adapter kit

Rewards are split into two levels: Standard and Premium. Standard rewards are available in: black, orange, tan, green, blue, and red. Pledge any TiScribe-Bolt and get additional TiScribe-Bolts for the early bird price (see rewards for details).
 

Premium rewards are available in: Black/Red, Black/Green, Desert Camo, and Black Camo. Color selections, total quantities, and all other important details will be collected via Backerkit at project end.

AVAILABLE NOW! Pricing and pledge information below.
Unicorn Dust (Premium Reward $144/$139 EB): White Clip and Bolt Carrier. Pen body is a combination of pink, blue, and white.
Pink (Standard Reward $107/$102 EB): Pink Pen Body, Tip, Cap, and Bolt Carrier
Arctic Trooper (Seperate Reward $112): White Pen Body. Black Tip, Cap, Clip, and Bolt Carrier

What's Mokuti?: Mokuti is forged with two or more titanium alloys (currently CP and 6AL4V). The titanium alloys are machined, then heat anodized to produce a unique blend of colors in the material. 

 Mokuti Clip: The Mokuti Pocket Clip Kit Includes: Laser Engraved Mokuti Pocket Clip, Titanium Torx Screws (2), and Torx Allen Wrench.
 Mokuti Tip Kit: The Mokuti Tip Kit Includes: Pen Tip (1) and Pen Cap (1)

Mokume Tip Kit:  Mokume is forged with two or more alloys (currently brass, copper and nickle). The alloys are machined, then chemically treated to produce a unique blend of colors in the material. The Mokume Tip Kit Includes: Pen Tip (1) and Pen Cap (1)
Parker Refill Converter: The ""Parker Style"" refill converter kit adds convenience to the writing process. The most difficult part of buying custom made pens is answering the question ""Will my favorite refill fit?"". Parker Style refills all have the same dimensions, so you KNOW it will fit. Most refill manufacturers make a ""Parker Style"" ink cartridge for this reason. Parker Style Kit is also compatible with the Fisher Space Pen refill.
 

Simply select the first pen as a reward, then add additional funds for the following pen or pens that you want. Do not add any extra funds for shipping as it is automatically added at project completion (flat rate of $6 USA and $16 international).  
 

We chose to do something different with the project video; JUST SHOW THE PENS! No music, no gimmicks, no fluff. All pen colors/patterns are displayed from multiple angles with bolt actuation. Color/pattern time stamps are listed below.
Black: 00:02:36

There were too many pictures to post in the Indiegogo Campaign, so we hosted them on the cloud. Click the above picture for additional images.

Urban Survival Gear (USG) has a backlog of 30+ new products. We always planned to launch them when the CNC machines are available. The problem is the machines are never available. The easy answer is to buy more machines, but we're out of space so....WE'RE EXPANDING! USG's new home will be in Texas.
Funds from this campaign will be used to construct a 3200 ft² production facility. We need your help in funding the construction. In return you'll get construction updates and a personal invite to the open-house in late 2019.  We should break-ground March/April 2019 and complete construction in October/November 2019 (lot video tour below).


 


The new facility provides 600% more space, thus enabling more machines and personnel. Basically: More Space = More Pens + Faster Production Time.

Urban Survival Gear, LLC will accept, for return or exchange, items that are in new condition, unworn, unaltered and free of damage by the customer. For a full refund or exchange, mail out your item within 14 days from the receipt of the original order. Items cannot be returned or exchanged after 14 days from receipt of the original order. Items must be returned with all Urban Survival Gear, LLC labels still attached and must be in the original packaging.

 
Risks and challenges
We've produced thousands, yes thousands, of TiScribe-Bolt's (TS-Bolt) so far. The TS-Bolt Version 2 includes updates, but the machine code and tooling is nearly identical. Production is really plug-and-play at this point.
Will the TS-Bolt really take until December 2018 to ship? Probably not due to the reusable tooling. We've also expanded our capabilities by adding another CNC lathe to the shop. The new lathe cuts production time in HALF. At USG we don't stop cranking until the project is done!
100% of the machining is done at our facility in California. The ceramic coating is outsourced to a Cerakote® Certified Applicator. They do quality work, FAST! Suppliers/subcontractors have been notified about this project and are awaiting our orders. We're confident that your pledge will get to you on-time or EARLY.

<p> </p>
<h2>What is creatorstand?</h2>
<p>The patented <strong>creatorstand</strong> provides more desktop comfort, organization and a better user experience when used with computers, smartphones, tablets and the web to learn, work, shop and be social. Following the Indiegogo campaign and feedback from the community, we decided to make the suggested retail price <strong>$19.95</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>creatorstand</strong> holds items like the following at a comfortable reading angle for digital work and reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Papers and printouts </li>
<li>Books and large note books</li>
<li>iPad and other tablets</li>
<li>Magazines</li>
<li>Clipboards and notepads</li>
<li>Bills, mail and misc. notes</li>
<li>creatorstand media (content, links &amp; offers) designed by other creators</li>
</ul><h2> </h2>
<h2>A ""Better Mousetrap""</h2>
<p><strong>The creatorstand reduces eye, neck and back strain. </strong>Your head, neck and shoulders are forced out of alignment when you work for extended periods of time on your computer, looking up at your screen and then down at a book, paper, etc. on a desktop. When the <strong>creatorstand</strong> holds your content closer to eye level and at a comfortable angle, you relieve the tension that results from that misalignment.</p>
<p><strong>It's eco-friendly.</strong> The <strong>creatorstand</strong> itself is made from recycled plastic, paper and vision. Even the packaging that encloses your <strong>creatorstand</strong> has a purpose. Don't throw it away! It enables a unique experience with specialized content, QR codes and links that appeal to your interests.</p>
<p><img alt=""creatorstand media with QR code"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/creatorstand_QRcode.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""creatorstand media with QR code""/></p>
<p>There are many reading stands on the market but none that can provide the same benefits for your digital and eco-friendly lifestyle. <strong>We believe creatorstand will make <a href=""http://www.officedepot.com/a/browse/document-and-bookholders/N=5+509554/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">traditional reading stands</a> obsolete. </strong>The creatorstand team also have an aftermarket plan; more on this after a successful product launch with Indiegogo.</p>
<h3><strong>How to use the creatorstand (see video above, too)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove the eco-friendly packaging carefully. Don't tear it, because it's part of the final product and customer experience</li>
<li>Snap the plastic <strong>creatorstand</strong> together. Flip over the packaging, and wrap it around the plastic stand</li>
<li>Place the assembled <strong>creatorstand</strong> next to your computer to hold what you want at a comfortable viewing angle</li>
<li>Interact with your <strong>creatorstand media</strong> designed by our <strong>creatorstand</strong> team to improve your desktop experience</li>
</ul><h3>The creatorstand holds iPads / tablets at a comfortable angle ...</h3>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Two Big Problems</strong></h2>
<p>People are spending more time on their computers, tablets, smartphones (gadgets) and the web. The Pew Internet Research below shows significant increases in our digital activities and consumption. Here's their ""Gadget Ownership by Age Group"" data from 2012 ...</p>
<p><img alt=""Digital Gadgets Use "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/Gadgets.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 5px; border-color: white;"" title=""Pew Internet Research""/></p>
<p>Without a doubt, longer time spent on these devices and the web <strong>causes more eye, neck and back strain</strong>. Still, you need to use them to get real work done, whether we're at our desks in school, the office, home or on-the-go.</p>
<p>Further, the brands and publishers we interact with via the web are creating more content. This increase in volume continues to grow every year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the brands and publishers we want to engage with online are frequently overlooked given all the digital clutter like annoying spam. <strong>The brands and publishers we love need to STAND OUT</strong> <strong>on the desktop.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Pew Internet Research"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/Internet_Usage.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; border-width: 5px; border-color: white;"" title=""Internet Adoption, 1995 - 2012""/></p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>'Digital Fatigue' and 'Digital Clutter' on the desktop are real problems for us, brands and publishers we engage with via digital gadgets and the web.</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>The <strong>creatorstand reduces digital fatigue and addresses the digital clutter problem </strong>by holding content and media at a comfortable viewing angle next to your computer and Internet connections. </p>
<p>Suppose you're writing a blog post or doing research, and you want to refer to content from a printed book or notes. The <strong>creatorstand</strong> holds your book/notes on a level close to your screen. This means you don't have to squint or crane your neck down to read the fine print on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the secret sauce! </strong>Other creators enhance <strong>creatorstand</strong> with <em><strong>meaningful content and links</strong></em> on the wrap-around packaging materials -- known as <strong>creatorstand media</strong> -- that will help you engage and get stuff done with your gadgets and the web; where your physical world meets the digital world on the desktop.</p>

<h2>An Extraordinary Backstory</h2>
<p><img alt=""1987 Press Photo of Erick Mott &amp; the Original Product, Copy Grip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/Erick_PressShot.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 5px; border-color: white;"" title=""1987 Press Photo of Erick Mott &amp; the Original Product, Copy Grip""/></p>
<p>As a college student, Erick Mott didn't enjoy homework because it was <strong>uncomfortable working while hunched over books, notes, etc. </strong></p>
<p>While studying one day, he envisioned a product with a <strong>gripping feature</strong> that would hold large textbooks, papers and other study essentials at a more comfortable viewing angle.</p>
<p>On that day, he became an entrepreneur. It was a euphoric moment because Erick could see the product clearly and committed to make it happen. A small group of creators set out to make the <em><strong>original Copy Grip product</strong></em> and bring it to market. (<em>1987 press photo of Erick Mott</em>)</p>
<p>If you've experienced a creative spark like this, you know the feeling. <strong>BAM! No turning back!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The team had some success in the mass market, selling tens of thousands of the Copy Grip</strong> products via <strong>Office Depot</strong>, <strong>college bookstores</strong>, <strong>computer accessory catalogs</strong> and more. They even secured a test market at Kmart that sold out. <strong>Kmart</strong> later decided not to sell the product because it was from a small, single-product business. That was frustrating after a year's work!</p>
<p><img alt=""Original Copy Grip in Retail"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/CopyGrip_Shelf_1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 5px; border-color: white;"" title=""Original Copy Grip in Retail""/></p>
<p>This happened in the days before the Internet, when it was extremely difficult for a small business to crack the mass market.</p>
<p>The Internet has leveled the playing field thanks to e-commerce, crowdfunding (yay, Indiegogo!) email and social media. These innovations now enable creators to bypass big-box retailers, and take products directly to consumers.</p>
<p><img alt=""creatorstand in the classroom"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/CopyGrip_classroom.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""creatorstand in the classroom""/></p>
<p>Although Erick moved on to other work, he never gave up on the Copy Grip. Working at Sun Microsystems, in the early dot-com days and later with other leading technology companies, inspired him to improve the original product design to be <strong>more web- and eco-friendly </strong>-- given Internet adoption as well as environmental advantages of working from anywhere with the web. Regardless of how simple a product or service like <strong>creatorstand </strong>is, <strong>green innovation with the web </strong>is good!</p>
<p>So, a new team <strong>redesigned the Copy Grip</strong> product and <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents?id=bcUJAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=erick+mott"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>secured a utility patent</strong></a> for the <em>device, method and system</em>. But life continued with Erick's marriage, his technology career in the San Francisco Bay Area, and an active family life. The new <strong>creatorstand</strong> product remained on the back burner for a number of years.</p>
<p><img alt=""creatorstand patent drawings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/cs_patent.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""creatorstand patent drawings""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>How 'Shark Tank' Inspired Erick Mott</h2>
<p><strong>Shark Tank, the ABC TV reality show</strong> that gives entrepreneurs a venue to pitch for investments in their early stage businesses and ideas, was a <a href=""http://www.creatorbase.com/blog/2011/06/shark-tank-in-dallas-the-time-is-now.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wake-up call</a> last year to get creative; again!  </p>
<p>Watching other creators pitch the ""Sharks,"" the self-made millionaires who put up their own cash for winning pitches, made Erick think about his product, patent and the plastic injection mold, then in storage, that could produce more than 30,000 units a month.</p>
<p><img alt=""creatorbase plastic injection mold, Westec Plastics, USA"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/creatorstand_mold.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 10px; border-color: white;"" title=""creatorbase plastic injection mold, Westec Plastics, USA""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Hmmm,"" he mused. ""This would be a good source of income to fund the kids' college educations."" <strong>BAM #2!</strong></p>
<p>He completed a <strong>Shark Tank video audition</strong> in May 2012 for the upcoming Season 4. You'll have to watch the show to see if Erick makes it to the Tank. But no matter what happens, he's motivated and the virtual team from the <a href=""http://www.creatorbase.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""creatorbase community"">creatorbase</a> community is organized to finally make the <strong>creatorstand</strong> product a reality with your support!</p>

<h2> Two Indiegogo Goals</h2>
<p><img alt=""Make a Stand with Crowdfunding from Indiegogo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/creatorstand_banner.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Make a Stand with Crowdfunding from Indiegogo""/></p>
<p>It's time to <strong>Make a Stand with Crowdfunding<em> </em></strong>and Indiegogo is our platform of choice. This is where the <strong>creatorstand</strong> rubber meets the road. <strong>BAM #3!</strong></p>
<p>You can help the team achieve two key goals with very little financial contribution and by sharing our campaign with friends, family and colleagues via email and through your blog, Twitter, Facebook and other social networking connections:</p>
<h3><strong> These goals are doable:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Successfully raise $15,000</strong> with roughly 1,000 creatorstands<strong> </strong>pre-ordered during the short campaign period</li>
<li>Achieve our <strong>stretch goal of 5,000 creatorstands pre-ordered</strong> during the short campaign period</li>
</ul><p>We can achieve these goals when you consider the mass-market reach for <strong>creatorstand</strong> through the Indiegogo website, social media sharing, media coverage, email, etc. Our US-based manufacturing team at <strong><a href=""http://www.westecplastics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Westec Plastics </a></strong>in Livermore, California USA is <strong>ready to start production</strong> as soon as we make some minor changes to the mold. </p>
<h3>Your contributions will help cover these few tasks that will take just 3 weeks to complete (WOW, we're SO CLOSE to shipping!):</h3>
<ul>
<li>New <strong>creatorstand</strong> logo and address plates for the steel mold</li>
<li>Final packaging based on the template seen in our video (feedback from the Indiegogo community will influence our <strong>creatorstand media</strong> design for you) </li>
<li>New packaging printed and ready for <strong>creatorstand </strong>production and shipments of your pre-orders from this campaign -- starting in September 2012</li>
</ul><h2> </h2>
<h2>Meaningful Perks for You</h2>
<p><img alt=""Make a Stand with Crowdfunding perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.creatorstand.com/stickershirt.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Make a Stand with Crowdfunding perks""/></p>
<p>You can choose from several tangible perks when you contribute to our campaign. They include a 4"" x 2"" sticker, T-shirt in sizes XL, L, M or S and the <strong>creatorstand</strong> (pre-ordered) in the quantities of your choice.</p>
<p>With your help, we'll create real value for you and/or others -- and we'll send a positive message to the world about <strong>creatorstand</strong> and the <em><strong>power of the web (and Indiegogo)</strong>.</em></p>

What's next?
We're reaching out to more leading brands on the web to pitch customized creatorstands, similar to what ExactTarget did for their customers. Browse our website or email inquiries to creatorstand.product@gmail.com.

What is creatorstand?
The patented creatorstand provides more desktop comfort, organization and a better user experience when used with computers, smartphones, tablets and the web to learn, work, shop and be social. Following the Indiegogo campaign and feedback from the community, we decided to make the suggested retail price $19.95.
The creatorstand holds items like the following at a comfortable reading angle for digital work and reading:

Papers and printouts 
Books and large note books
iPad and other tablets
Magazines
Clipboards and notepads
Bills, mail and misc. notes
creatorstand media (content, links & offers) designed by other creators
 
A ""Better Mousetrap""
The creatorstand reduces eye, neck and back strain. Your head, neck and shoulders are forced out of alignment when you work for extended periods of time on your computer, looking up at your screen and then down at a book, paper, etc. on a desktop. When the creatorstand holds your content closer to eye level and at a comfortable angle, you relieve the tension that results from that misalignment.
It's eco-friendly. The creatorstand itself is made from recycled plastic, paper and vision. Even the packaging that encloses your creatorstand has a purpose. Don't throw it away! It enables a unique experience with specialized content, QR codes and links that appeal to your interests.

There are many reading stands on the market but none that can provide the same benefits for your digital and eco-friendly lifestyle. We believe creatorstand will make traditional reading stands obsolete. The creatorstand team also have an aftermarket plan; more on this after a successful product launch with Indiegogo.
How to use the creatorstand (see video above, too)

Remove the eco-friendly packaging carefully. Don't tear it, because it's part of the final product and customer experience
Snap the plastic creatorstand together. Flip over the packaging, and wrap it around the plastic stand
Place the assembled creatorstand next to your computer to hold what you want at a comfortable viewing angle
Interact with your creatorstand media designed by our creatorstand team to improve your desktop experience

Without a doubt, longer time spent on these devices and the web causes more eye, neck and back strain. Still, you need to use them to get real work done, whether we're at our desks in school, the office, home or on-the-go.
Further, the brands and publishers we interact with via the web are creating more content. This increase in volume continues to grow every year.
Unfortunately, the brands and publishers we want to engage with online are frequently overlooked given all the digital clutter like annoying spam. The brands and publishers we love need to STAND OUT on the desktop.

 
 
'Digital Fatigue' and 'Digital Clutter' on the desktop are real problems for us, brands and publishers we engage with via digital gadgets and the web.
 
 
 
Our Solution
The creatorstand reduces digital fatigue and addresses the digital clutter problem by holding content and media at a comfortable viewing angle next to your computer and Internet connections. 
Suppose you're writing a blog post or doing research, and you want to refer to content from a printed book or notes. The creatorstand holds your book/notes on a level close to your screen. This means you don't have to squint or crane your neck down to read the fine print on the page.
Here's the secret sauce! Other creators enhance creatorstand with meaningful content and links on the wrap-around packaging materials -- known as creatorstand media -- that will help you engage and get stuff done with your gadgets and the web; where your physical world meets the digital world on the desktop.
 
An Extraordinary Backstory

As a college student, Erick Mott didn't enjoy homework because it was uncomfortable working while hunched over books, notes, etc. 
While studying one day, he envisioned a product with a gripping feature that would hold large textbooks, papers and other study essentials at a more comfortable viewing angle.
On that day, he became an entrepreneur. It was a euphoric moment because Erick could see the product clearly and committed to make it happen. A small group of creators set out to make the original Copy Grip product and bring it to market. (1987 press photo of Erick Mott)
If you've experienced a creative spark like this, you know the feeling. BAM! No turning back!
The team had some success in the mass market, selling tens of thousands of the Copy Grip products via Office Depot, college bookstores, computer accessory catalogs and more. They even secured a test market at Kmart that sold out. Kmart later decided not to sell the product because it was from a small, single-product business. That was frustrating after a year's work!

This happened in the days before the Internet, when it was extremely difficult for a small business to crack the mass market.
The Internet has leveled the playing field thanks to e-commerce, crowdfunding (yay, Indiegogo!) email and social media. These innovations now enable creators to bypass big-box retailers, and take products directly to consumers.

Although Erick moved on to other work, he never gave up on the Copy Grip. Working at Sun Microsystems, in the early dot-com days and later with other leading technology companies, inspired him to improve the original product design to be more web- and eco-friendly -- given Internet adoption as well as environmental advantages of working from anywhere with the web. Regardless of how simple a product or service like creatorstand is, green innovation with the web is good!
So, a new team redesigned the Copy Grip product and secured a utility patent for the device, method and system. But life continued with Erick's marriage, his technology career in the San Francisco Bay Area, and an active family life. The new creatorstand product remained on the back burner for a number of years.

 
How 'Shark Tank' Inspired Erick Mott
Shark Tank, the ABC TV reality show that gives entrepreneurs a venue to pitch for investments in their early stage businesses and ideas, was a wake-up call last year to get creative; again!  
Watching other creators pitch the ""Sharks,"" the self-made millionaires who put up their own cash for winning pitches, made Erick think about his product, patent and the plastic injection mold, then in storage, that could produce more than 30,000 units a month.

 
""Hmmm,"" he mused. ""This would be a good source of income to fund the kids' college educations."" BAM #2!
He completed a Shark Tank video audition in May 2012 for the upcoming Season 4. You'll have to watch the show to see if Erick makes it to the Tank. But no matter what happens, he's motivated and the virtual team from the creatorbase community is organized to finally make the creatorstand product a reality with your support!
 
 Two Indiegogo Goals

It's time to Make a Stand with Crowdfunding and Indiegogo is our platform of choice. This is where the creatorstand rubber meets the road. BAM #3!
You can help the team achieve two key goals with very little financial contribution and by sharing our campaign with friends, family and colleagues via email and through your blog, Twitter, Facebook and other social networking connections:
 These goals are doable:


Successfully raise $15,000 with roughly 1,000 creatorstands pre-ordered during the short campaign period
Achieve our stretch goal of 5,000 creatorstands pre-ordered during the short campaign period
We can achieve these goals when you consider the mass-market reach for creatorstand through the Indiegogo website, social media sharing, media coverage, email, etc. Our US-based manufacturing team at Westec Plastics in Livermore, California USA is ready to start production as soon as we make some minor changes to the mold. 
Your contributions will help cover these few tasks that will take just 3 weeks to complete (WOW, we're SO CLOSE to shipping!):

New creatorstand logo and address plates for the steel mold
Final packaging based on the template seen in our video (feedback from the Indiegogo community will influence our creatorstand media design for you) 
New packaging printed and ready for creatorstand production and shipments of your pre-orders from this campaign -- starting in September 2012
 
Meaningful Perks for You

You can choose from several tangible perks when you contribute to our campaign. They include a 4"" x 2"" sticker, T-shirt in sizes XL, L, M or S and the creatorstand (pre-ordered) in the quantities of your choice.
With your help, we'll create real value for you and/or others -- and we'll send a positive message to the world about creatorstand and the power of the web (and Indiegogo).

 
We're making a stand for a few things worth striving for, now: 

Achieving a challenging goal
Bringing a ""better mousetrap"" to market via the web 
Creating eco-friendly and customer experience value; Made in USA  
Crowdfunding with Indiegogo is a beautiful thing! Kindly share this campaign with your friends, family and colleagues with email, on your blog and through Twitter, Facebook, and your other social networking connections.

 Northern California's LGBT Friendly Business Directory began in 1999 with our own hunt for a Sacramento-based lawyer who was gay-friendly. Our long and circuitous search left us with many tales of similar situations from others in the community.We saw there was a great need for a directory of LGBT-owned and LGBT friendly businesses in Northern California, and set out to create our site.
  In 1999 we started as a web based site only. Early 2001 we added a printed directory Somewhere around 2010 we launched our first attempt at a smart phone App.
Now in 2015 we are working on a whole new app that will work on almost all smart phones.  Your contribution will help fund and finish the development of our cross platform app of LGBT friendly businesses in Northern California.   What We Need & What You Get   Our $15,000 funding goal will be used to help develop and complete our cross platform smart phone app. Funds will also go to creating SEO for both the app and our current website and printed edition marketing. Our ability to market these businesses to the LGBT community means more money for LGBT friendly businesses and keeps our economy going. If we do not make our goal all funds will go towards getting us closer to completion of our app and spreading the word to our community.    The Impact The more we are able to market LGBT friendly businesses, the more we boost our economy.  Every business that advertises brings the world one step closer to equality for all of us.
NOW more then ever we need to be able to these LGBT friendly businesses over the ones that are showing that they don't want our money.
Our success over the past 16 years with our web site and printed edition just gives us more motivation to grow with the ever expanding world of technology.

They saw a need for a product that improves upon what other mobile payment apps, and group couponing sites lack, as well as introduces new and exciting customer acquisition ideas to the retail sales world. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We were fed up with the current products on the market today, and we are creating a new technology that will change everything about the way retail sales are made.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Background</strong></p>
<p>Arnell has vast experience in the technology sector and as a business owner. In 2010 he started a daily deal and group couponing site for businesses in Rhode Island. He also owns Butter Day Spa in downtown Providence and from 2006 to 2009 was the President of the Downtown Merchants Association in Providence RI. From 2000-2004, Arnell worked for two successful high tech startups, both of which were purchased by larger corporation (EMC and European Pan Communications). Arnell has firsthand experience with the challenges facing startups, the current group coupon sites model, as well as the downside for merchants who use group coupon sites to gain business.</p>
<p>David also has a great deal of business experience. In 2005 he started a Motorsports Marketing company that sold sponsorships for some of the biggest teams in NASCAR and Indycar racing. He has been in sales his entire life, and has worked for Fortune 500 companies as well as for himself over his career. David has a great deal of knowledge relating to retail sales and the challenges faced by retailers who are trying to grow their business.</p>
<p><strong>The current Problems</strong></p>
<p>We saw three problems with the current mobile applications that are supposed to make purchasing products easier, and gain new business for retailers.</p>
<p>The first problem is that many of the mobile payment apps that are currently on the market rely on NFC (near field communications) to process payments. While these apps allows customers to make payments with their smart phone, unfortunately, that is all they do. There are no other benefits associated with using these apps, and to be honest other than the cool factor there is no reason to use them over just using a regular credit card! Also iphone users will not be able to use these apps due to the lack of NFC on those devices. Furthermore, merchants would have to purchase specialized credit card processing equipment to take payments with those apps, with no tangible ROI on that investment.</p>
<p>The second problem we saw was with daily deal sites that give huge discounts to consumers, but take all the profit out of the item for the merchant. Merchants use these services in the hope of gaining additional business but instead find that most people come in once to use the coupon and never return.</p>
<p>Finally the current paper loyalty cards that merchants hand out all over the country provide no feedback or information back to the merchant such as how many people have these cards, how often their customers make a purchase, or the last time they were in the store.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>
<p>PaymentSpree is the solution to these problems and more. The mobile payment feature of PaymentSpree will allow any merchant to take payments with this app and they will not need any equipment at all. Even if they do not currently take credit cards they can still take payments with our app.</p>
<p>To deal with the issues with the current group coupon sites, PaymentSpree only takes a small percentage from merchants like a credit card to accept payments with our app, but PaymentSpree also lets merchants send targeted deals to their customers using the app, everyday. They can specifically target customers who came in once and never returned or all their customers. The deal is also decided by the merchant and not by PaymentSpree. If a merchant wants to give 5, 10, 50 or 1 percent off it is up to them. A merchant will never feel bad or ripped off after offering a deal via PaymentSpree</p>
<p>Finally PaymentSpree has a customer loyalty card that leverages deep analytics which will to help merchants take the customer loyalty card concept to another level. This gives merchants the power of having information on how many people are in their rewards program, and will allow them to send messages to certain members with deals enticing them to make additional purchases. Imagine a merchant being able to see how many people are in their loyalty program that have 1 check mark and have never returned. They then send them a targeted deal to get them back to the store. They can also see how many people are two checks away from the reward and send them a deal giving them two checks on their next purchase instead of one.</p>
<p>Customers will benefit from receiving great deals from the places they shop, as well as cash back in the form of Spreebucks from PaymentSpree for every purchase they make, similar to a credit card cash back reward system, but our system differs by increasing the percentage a customer gets back on each purchase the more they spend on the app.</p>
<p><strong>PaymentSpree creates a WIN-WIN for both consumers and merchants that these other apps do not.</strong> <strong>PaymentSpree is going to change the way consumers make purchases and how merchants connect with customers forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Investment</strong></p>
<p>PaymentSpree is going to use your investment to continue development of this app, and to create the infrastructure to support the sheer number of users and transactions we anticipate when this application comes to market. Our goal is to raise $75,000 which will give us the necessary capital to finish coding, testing, and implementation of the application. If we raise a lower amount than what we are hoping for we will continue to work until this application is completed and will look for investments in other locations. We are fully committed to seeing this project completed and it is our passion. We have been working night and day to get to this point and to produce the prototype you currently see our video. We need you to help us get to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p>We are offering some very cool perks for our investors. We consider each one of you to be a partner and appreciate what you bring to our business. We are offering perks ranging from a sincere thank you from our team, up to Original investor certificates, PaymentSpree T-shirts, mentions on the credits of the app, and bonus Spreecash when you download the app.</p>

WARRANTY, OUR TAGS WILL WORK OR YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK</p>
<p><b>Materials </b></p>
<p>Pet tags are
made of heavy steal and Celazole. Celazole is widely recognized as the hardest
plastic on the planet and has a melting point of 1400°F, which is 200° above
the melting point of aluminum. In short your curious kitty or cuddly canine is
not going to be chewing threw or even scratching this space-age plastic. Celazole
was originally developed by N.A.S.A for use on the space shuttle, now we make
SmarT-TagS from it.</p>
<p><b>My pet already has tags, so why do I
need this?</b></p>
<p>SmarT-TagS cost the same as traditional pet tags but offer many advanced
features that even other enhanced tags and even microchips do not offer. One
common problem is that pets are picked up by rescuers and they attempt to find
the owner on sites like Facebook. The problem is that only their friends can
see the post, with our hashtag support an instant line of communication is
opened between the two of you. Also your pets GPS location is recorded and
forwarded to you so you know roughly where to look for your pet. In addition to
this your pet can be reported 24/7 to an emergency response line and we will
notify you instantly via telephone, email, and text message. </p>
<p><b>What percentage of pets, get
returned?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>On average 98% of pets used are returned within 3 hours, 2% are returned
within 3 days. During beta tests for this product we provided 500 pet owners
with pets that frequently wonder off with this product and every pet was
located and returned very quickly. Our product will even help protect your pet
against abduction. </p>
<p><b>How can I order? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Simply claim the perk and after the fundraiser we will mail your choice
of item to you free of charge. We will also donate 10% of the profits from each
sale to No-Kill animal shelters. If you are a shelter leader, pet shop owner,
or veterinarian and wish to stock our products at your store please contact us
for a free customized package that fits your budget. </p>
<p><b>What is the purpose of this
fundraiser?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5,000 to take our product from a beta test to a
finished version suitable for retail sales. We will use a portion of this money
to setup a website for pet owners to purchase new tags, make changes to
existing tags, and check for updates on their pets. We have already contracted
with a manufacturer to do an initial run of SmarT-TagS, and with a fulfillment company
to send out orders to customers and process any returns. Phone support will be
available soon we are programming the automated phone line in preparation for
our product launch. </p>
<p><b>How can I support this product or
make a donation?</b></p>
<p>If you would like to make a donation simply click the contribute button.
Many people who are not pet owners still support campaigns because they want to
see the product reach the market because of the impact it will have on
society.  It is very important that you
share a link to our fundraiser no just on your own page but on the pages of
others so that their friends can see it as well. If everyone who saw this post
sent it to 10 friends we would reach our goal in just one day.</p>

<p>Here are two examples of lost pets that I pulled from my personal facebook page just this morning these were not staged.

<h3>SmarT-TagS</h3>
<p><br/>SmarT-TagS include both a collar and 2 sets of SmarT-TagS. Collars are made of heavy duty faux leather(we didn't want to hurt any cows) and durable steel. SmarT-TagS are made of metal and heavy duty polymer that is sure to last a very long time. They were designed to be resistant against being broken, chewed on, or slipped off. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>QR Codes(Quick Response Code)can be scanned with any smartphone with a FREE QR Code Reader. When the unique code is scanned a unique webpage is pulled up via the user's smartphone. Your pet's vital information will be displayed there as well as information on how to contact you. </p>
<p>Hashtags (#hashtags) a hashtag is a word or phrase prefixed with the symbol # It is a form of metadata tag. Short messages on microblogging and social networking services such as Twitter, Tout, Identi.ca, Tumblr, Flicker, Google+ or Facebook may be tagged by putting ""#' important words. If you have forgotten to update your information don't worry a unique hashtag(#hashtag) is assigned to your pet with directions on how to use it to locate you. The person who found your pet simply enters the unique hashtag on any social networking site, and you enter the same code to look for your pet. The hashtag acts like a 2-way radio allowing the two of you to establish communication to make arrangements to pickup you pet. Only SmarT-TagS offer hashtag support this is a unique feature that we have developed to help bring your pet home safe if every other option fails. </p>
<p>We also offer a call center where your pet can be reported, our agents will gather your information then contact you will all the vital details. In addition to this our agents will send out an SMS text message to your mobile device and an email to be sure that you get the message as soon as possible.</p>
<p>SmarT-TagS automatically logs your pets last known location when his/her tag is scanned. An interactive map of the GPS coordinates will be forwarded to you via email and SMS text message. The positioning is accurate down to roughly 15 meters giving you a very good idea of where your pet is located even if the person who found him has not reported him/her, in this case, curiosity could save the cat.</p>

SmarT-TagS
utilize QR Codes and hashtags to show vital information about your pet as well
as locate you pet over social networking sites. When the smart-tag is scanned a
GPS location is automatically captured via the users smartphone, while a unique
webpage is displayed with your pets vital info, your contact information, and a
unique hashtag that both you and the rescuer can enter into any social
networking site to get in touch anywhere in the world. SmarT-TagS also offer a
24 hour hotline to report your missing pet, when your pet is reported you will
be notified via text message, telephone, and email.

Materials 
Pet tags are
made of heavy steal and Celazole. Celazole is widely recognized as the hardest
plastic on the planet and has a melting point of 1400°F, which is 200° above
the melting point of aluminum. In short your curious kitty or cuddly canine is
not going to be chewing threw or even scratching this space-age plastic. Celazole
was originally developed by N.A.S.A for use on the space shuttle, now we make
SmarT-TagS from it.
My pet already has tags, so why do I
need this?
SmarT-TagS cost the same as traditional pet tags but offer many advanced
features that even other enhanced tags and even microchips do not offer. One
common problem is that pets are picked up by rescuers and they attempt to find
the owner on sites like Facebook. The problem is that only their friends can
see the post, with our hashtag support an instant line of communication is
opened between the two of you. Also your pets GPS location is recorded and
forwarded to you so you know roughly where to look for your pet. In addition to
this your pet can be reported 24/7 to an emergency response line and we will
notify you instantly via telephone, email, and text message. 
What percentage of pets, get
returned?

On average 98% of pets used are returned within 3 hours, 2% are returned
within 3 days. During beta tests for this product we provided 500 pet owners
with pets that frequently wonder off with this product and every pet was
located and returned very quickly. Our product will even help protect your pet
against abduction. 
How can I order? 

Simply claim the perk and after the fundraiser we will mail your choice
of item to you free of charge. We will also donate 10% of the profits from each
sale to No-Kill animal shelters. If you are a shelter leader, pet shop owner,
or veterinarian and wish to stock our products at your store please contact us
for a free customized package that fits your budget. 
What is the purpose of this
fundraiser?

Our goal is to raise $5,000 to take our product from a beta test to a
finished version suitable for retail sales. We will use a portion of this money
to setup a website for pet owners to purchase new tags, make changes to
existing tags, and check for updates on their pets. We have already contracted
with a manufacturer to do an initial run of SmarT-TagS, and with a fulfillment company
to send out orders to customers and process any returns. Phone support will be
available soon we are programming the automated phone line in preparation for
our product launch. 
How can I support this product or
make a donation?
If you would like to make a donation simply click the contribute button.
Many people who are not pet owners still support campaigns because they want to
see the product reach the market because of the impact it will have on
society.  It is very important that you
share a link to our fundraiser no just on your own page but on the pages of
others so that their friends can see it as well. If everyone who saw this post
sent it to 10 friends we would reach our goal in just one day.

What links do I share?

Invite your friends and share our links to their wall as well as your own.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How you be a part of The HAT and this data revolution?</b></p>
<p>We’re looking for £50,000 to help us transition from a funded university research project to an online platform that will benefit the public. This amount of money will help us get started on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Launching HAT in beta with 1GB storage for every user from July 2016 (<a href=""http://www.hatdex.org/country/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here to check if and when HAT is available in your country</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Transitioning from beta to public within 3 months. </p></li>
<li><p>Building the development community to build more apps to help you do more with your data, and write more code to bring more data in for ourselves.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We chose to go down the crowdfunding route because it’s important that we are all in this together as a community to collectively want our data from the Internet! <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We wanted to use Indiegogo to reach new people in the social movement to help people become more aware of their data online, and to start a revolution in the way people use the Internet.</span></p>
<p>There’s a lot more we dream of doing - but this will help us start on what we need to do first. And we want to hear from you - our supporters and future HAT users - on what you’d most like us to include and focus on. Talk to us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hubofallthings/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> or <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheHATDex"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> or visit our <a href=""http://www.hatdex.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Perks for Indiegogo supporters</b></p>
<p>If our Indiegogo is successful, a standard HAT that includes 1GB storage, data plugs and use of Rumpel will be free for all our backers. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We are asking Indiegogo supporters to </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">help us make that happen</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> and in return, you will be the first to get a HAT. </span></p>
<p>Your HAT ID is not an email address. it's an actual IP address, your digital presence on the Internet, a microservice container. For Indiegogo earlybird and beta access users, you will be the first to get a preferred HAT address of name.hubofallthings.net - or name.hubat.net for short.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We’re opening the opportunity up for you to be an Associate member of the HAT Community Foundation through our Indiegogo campaign. Associate members will be consulted on future developments and have privileges such as being the first to test out new functionalities on the HAT, access to events, research papers and focus groups for feature evolutions. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We also want to encourage companies to support the HAT and offer HATs to their customers! HAT Corporate supporters will be given priority for their product or service to be 'HAT ready', which means their customers can pull their data the corporation holds on them into their HATs.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>If you back with more than £10 you’ll be a part of the HAT user community and will have an opportunity to invest in the HATDEX Company.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>The HAT in more detail</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The HAT is a private and secure cloud-based information system with storage and data processing abilities. It's your own microserver container. You can access your data and manage it from an easy-to-use dashboard, a hyperdata browser we call Rumpel. With Rumpel, you can access your HAT from a desktop and mobile devices.</span></p>
<p>If you are an expert user, you can install the HAT on your computer or other devices in your home or office (the hard HAT), or if you're like the rest of us, subscribe to a service provided by certified HAT platform providers (HPP) that are legally committed to ensure privacy, security and confidentiality. You can move your HAT between HPPs at any time. HPPs are regulated by <a href=""http://hubofallthings.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the HAT Foundation</a>.</p>
<p><b>COLLECT</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>HAT offers data plugs to claim your personal data from the Internet, your mobile and IoT wearables, and all those companies gathering, storing and selling information on you.</p></li>
<li><p>What do we mean by data? Where you are and where have you been, what you were listening to, what was in your diary, what you bought, what you searched, what you sent, what you photographed. Also your calendar, your email and more, the list goes on!</p></li>
<li><p>Who can you claim your data from? Google, Facebook, supermarkets, online stores, phone GPS, streaming services, transport companies, your broadband provider - anyone you can imagine. We’ll strive to add as many as possible to make your own HAT more data rich.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>VISUALISE</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using Rumpel - the first ever hyperdata browser - you can see what different companies know about you.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the data only you know about yourself - your diary, habits, health, coffee preferences and more.</p></li>
<li><p>Put all of this data together and build a picture of yourself using all of these digital fragments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>CONTROL</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>YOU can choose what you do with this data.</p></li>
<li><p>You can keep it just for your enjoyment, information or peace of mind - to get to know yourself better and make smart choices online.</p></li>
<li><p>Or you can share it with friends and family without a third party being involved - to help making plans run smoother, or just for fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Or you can securely trade this valuable resource for reward credits, discount codes, money, recommendations.</p></li>
<li><p>Have you ever signed in to a service with your Google or Facebook account? Why should they be a custodian of your data? Now you can use your own HAT to sign in and actually control the data you share - using a ‘data debit’ - with others and terminate the data debit when you don't want to share it anymore!</p></li>
<li><p>And YES, we keep the control tight through the HAT APIs, following the<a href=""http://hubofallthings.com/hatoutputs/hat-briefing-papers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Code of Practice in Privacy, Confidentiality, Security and Trust</a> developed by the research project.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<div><div>The HAT is not just a personal data container! It is truly a privacy preserving market platform for you to exchange and monetise your data with others. All market platforms need a regulator to ensure everyone abides by the rules of the market, especially with regard to privacy, security and confidentiality.

<li><p>Data plugs to connect with your calendar, Facebook, iPhone location, Dropbox (and your photos from dropbox), Spotify, Withings, Fitbit, My Fitness Pal and Fibaro. (We will keep adding more data plugs - so if you have requests, let us know!)</p></li>
<li><p>Rumpel - the HAT hyperdata browser to manage, organise and exchange your personal data.</p></li>
<li><p>Applications from HAT platform providers.</p></li>
<li><p>APIs for developers to build lots of applications to offer rewards for your personal data. </p></li>
<li><p>APIs for developers to build Rumpel plugins to do help you do more stuff with your data.</p></li>

<p>Here's what the press are saying about the HAT: </p>
<p>“If the HAT project’s model of data as a form of currency comes to pass, <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">it will represent a turning point for businesses that have so far been </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">helping themselves.

<p>“…the point of the HAT – the Hub of All Things – your personal capability <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">to hold everything about you as privately as you wish and, moreover, to </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">trade it on the open market if you so choose; a commodity of great </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">value that will be sought after as industry shifts its attention towards </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">ever-more personalized products and services to suit the way you live </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">and work.” - Groupe Intellex</span></p>

<p><b>How much will HAT cost each year?</b></p>
<p>The basic HAT consisting of 1GB of storage + data plugs + Rumpel would be around £50 per annum. That is a fully private HAT where you are not obligated to share any data. However, you may opt to get free HATs from our HAT service providers (HSPs) who would require you to share some data with them. You will be able to say yes or no to sharing that data before you get your HAT.  We aim to give you choices in HAT service providers (HSP) so that you can shop around for the most suitable HPP. More importantly, HAT Data Exchange (<a href=""http://www.hatdex.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HATDEX: the firm managing the HAT ecosystem</a>) rules allow you to change HSPs and bring your data with you!</p>
<p>You may need to pay annually for more storage, premium hyperdata browser features and other applications on the HAT later on - but you could possibly get it back from your data exchanges!</p>
<p><b>When will we get our HATs?</b></p>
<p>We hope to get HATs out by July 2016 with a choice of 2 or more certified HAT Service Providers. As personal data storage is often governed by national rules, <a href=""http://www.hatdex.org/country/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> to check when you can get your HAT based on your location. </p>
<p><b>Can I help you in any other way?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Please share this page on social media, or forward it to your contacts via email.</p>
<p>Most people don’t find data particularly interesting, so they’re missing out on all of the potential. If you help us reach your friends and networks, we might be able to change the way the Internet works.</p>
<p>Even if you just send this on to 3 people, you’ll make a huge difference.</p>
<p><b>What do you mean by data?</b></p>
<p>This could mean less security sensitive data such as your facebook posts, your location on your smartphone, your calendar, your health data, your likes, your coffee preferences, your weight, height, all the way to data that is security sensitive such as credit card information, bank statements etc.</p>
<p><b>Which companies collect data?</b></p>
<p>Supermarkets collect data about what you buy. Insurance companies collect data about your claims. Google collect data from your searches, emails, calendar. Facebook collect data on your social interactions. Energy companies collect data on your energy use. Your phone has the location you've been. This list can go on and on and on. There really is a lot about you out there.</p>
<p><b>How do they do it?</b></p>
<p>Mostly you give it to them. by using their tools, by checking out at the cashier, by signing up to their service. you probably have signed several terms and conditions that gives your data away.</p>
<p><b>Do they know it’s MY data?</b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><b>How does The HAT help me claim it?</b></p>
<p>You might not believe it, but many of these services share your data with other companies, but they must do so with your permission. Ever signed in on a web service with Google? or sign up to an application with your Facebook account? They do it through APIs. So we figured that if these companies are sharing data about us with one another, might as well share it with us too! so the HAT is your own service provider to yourself, and you can then claim your data into your HAT!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How is The HAT different from other Personal Data Stores (PDS)?</b></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The HAT is a database in your own Micro Server Container, whilst PDS are normally an account in a centralised database with many accounts). So a breach of admin level access on PDS usually exposes all users’ data, while the same breach on HAT would only expose one user’s data.</p></li>
<li><p>The HAT Personal Data Schema allows data from multiple verticals to be bridged and re-organised, <span>even reorganising data points</span>, while PDS tends to keep vertical data in their original forms.</p></li>
<li><p>The HAT's Direct Data Debits allow you to control what bundle you’d like to share, who to share with, when and how in a 'direct debit' manner, meaning you have full control, and can change your mind, even after your initial agreement to share the data, although you might no longer benefit from the exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>HAT is an exchange platform - all parties SSL certified, and communication enforced via the HAT APIs, and your all data exchanges are logged so that you know the journey of your data within the ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p>The HAT network actually has a regulatory body and oversight through the HAT foundation and it regulates any party participating in the exchange ecosystem to act within the code of practice. HAT Foundation certification ensures every party “play nice” according to the rules, otherwise they may be excluded from the ecosystem.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>What does my data look like?</b></p>
<p>That is actually quite a hard question! We often don’t see our data because it just goes to companies and we don’t get a chance to view it. This is why the HAT will come with your own hyperdata browser - Rumpel - for you to view your own data. </p>
<p><b>Where is it stored?</b></p>
<p>For the initial roll out, we will be offering HATs on cloud servers. We call them Sun HATs. In future, you can have HATs as a box in your home (we call them Hard HATs) or with your data completely distributed across the internet to be accessed whenever you pull out your browser (we call them Straw HATs).</p>
<p><b>Is it secure?</b></p>
<p>It is as secure as most cloud storage providers such as Dropbox, iCloud or Box.</p>
<p><b>Is it confidential and private?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the HAT Foundation certification ensures that HPPs contract with you is legally binding in terms of your privacy and confidentiality. Although, if you do share it through the HAT Data Debit system, it may no longer be private!</p>
<p><b>Does claiming my data back mean the companies don’t have it any more?</b></p>
<p>No. You are merely taking a copy of your data. Remember, without the technology of the companies, these data would not even exist so legally, that data is theirs. However, once the network gets more established, we believe that companies will have less incentive to hold your data (it does cost them to store and it is risky for them as well). It then would make more sense to synchronise your HAT with their system. We think this would change the Internet for the better!</p>
<p><b>What exactly can I do with my data?</b></p>
<p>It’s one of those questions that can be answered glibly like - you can do this and this and this - but to be honest, the future is to be invented by all of us! It may be that we will use it to match what we have with what we buy e.g. matching our wardrobe with clothes on sale, or we can just monetise it e.g. selling how we use our energy to companies that match deals with our usage or maybe even just to track our own habits so that we can change our diet, lifestyle etc. The initial roll out would allow you to get credits or discount codes for bundles of your data.</p>
<p><b>How many HATs can there be?</b></p>
<p>The technology is really at the leading edge, so we expect only up to a million HATs can be technologically feasible to begin with. Our indiegogo supporters will be amongst the select few who will be the first to get their HATs.</p>
<p><b>If I have my own HAT server, what is the point of a HPP?</b></p>
<p>A HPP acts as your trust broker, a sysadmin, an IT management role, so that you don't need to do the back end IT/IS plumbing that you would normally have to do if you own a server e.g. security. HPP could be your host server provider, or could be your managed service for a separate host server. There are a few models of HPPs so it would depend on you to decide which HPP is best suited for you to decide. Regardless, they all have to to be certified by the HAT foundation.</p>
<p><b>Who can be a HPP?</b></p>
<p>Anyone can, as long as you meet the requirements of the HAT foundation for providing the HAT technology with an infrastructure that ensures privacy, security, confidentiality and trust. The technology created by the HAT research project has been released as open sourced and given out free so technically, if you wish to be your own HPP, you can as well. You would need to get yourself-as-HPP certified, otherwise you will be missing out on all the HAT services offering rewards and applications on HAT data. Many of our HATDEX certified HPPs often have their own extras services for your HAT data.</p>

We are live! Get your HATs here! https://hatters.hubofallthings.com
This indiegogo campaign is now used for premium membership for the HAT Community Foundation. Thank you for all your support - let others know and let's all have our HATs on!

Update 26 July 2016
We released beta! Check our update on the tab above or click herehttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hat-claim-your-data-organise-visualise-control-technology/x/12129843#/updatesUpdate 8 April 2016WE'VE HIT THE TARGET! Thank you all for your support! We're also happy to announce that we will be rolling out the beta HATs in July as planned!To celebrate this achievement, we will be adding a new functionality to mobile Rumpel (your private hyperdata browser). You will be able to create a shopping list and share it so that you can get offers for what you wish to buy!We'd really like to use our remaining time to help build a public space where HAT users can interact, browse data offers and even get together to ask for our data back from other corporations! We call this space the MarketSquare. To build it, we think we need to reach 300 HATs - If you have already signed up, do share this link to invite friends and family. If you haven't, do sign up soon as HATs are limited!Also, do let us know in the comments section of the campaign what data you'd like to be pulled into your HATso that we can all benefit even more from exchanging data!The original story: Personal Data - “All information about me in existence”You can monetise your personal data, and change society at the same time. We're launching The HAT to help you do just that.What does monetising data mean? Claim back all of the information corporations keep on you. Package it up and trade it - and change the way corporations rule the Internet. That's what The HAT lets you do.Over 60% of people believe their data is worth £30 per month.* In reality, it could be a lot more.Forget everything you know about data, and about how corporations rule the Internet. We’ve got a brand new solution - The HAT!The HAT is a personal data store and a multisided platform technology that allows you to see, control and share your personal data. (Keep reading and we explain why that's more exciting than it sounds!)We’re a company that started as a big research project - a partnership between 6 universities. Together, we realised that we can change the Internet. We can help people who give away their data online start to benefit from this - and make real money from their ordinary behaviour! This is the Bigger Data Revolution.“If the HAT project’s model of data as a form of currency comes to pass, it will represent a turning point for businesses that have so far been helping themselves.” Financial Times“This HAT project has the potential to redefine the way that the Internet works. It's a true breakthrough movement.” Digital Catapult“The platform allows the effective brokering, exchanging or monetising of personal data to benefit individuals, giving individuals a voice in the commercial world.” ZDNetHow does it work?Every time you log in with Facebook, go anywhere with Google Maps, shop online, use a search engine - you are GIVING AWAY your personal data to corporations. Those corporations become custodian of your data, and they analyse, harvest and profit from it.You can’t see it, and you don’t have the ability to trade it like they do. But it’s yours! And we believe you should be able to track and trade just as the biggest companies in the world do.With the HAT, you can take control, combine and start benefiting from of all of your personal data scattered around the Internet.Why get a HAT?Finally see what corporations know about you - because knowledge can provide peace of mindCombine ALL of your personal data for the first time - make cool visualisations about your lifeTrade your data for financial incentives - corporations sell your data, now you can tooGive society a gift - health advances and more can be achieved faster with more data availableMake the Internet truly work for you - if all your data is one place, recommendations become more useful than everChange the Internet forever - if we all got HATs, we could take the power back from the corporations using our data to line their pocketsWhat exactly can you do with your HAT?The possibilities are endless! The HAT is a vision as well as a great service. Here’s what you can start with:You can claim your data - for the first time see what organisations like Facebook, Google, broadband providers, supermarkets, online stores, streaming services and transport providers and more know about youYou can organise this data - combine your personal information like calendar, photos and emails with the data you’ve claimed and use wonderful visualisations to see what the digital version of you really looks likeYou can trade this data - companies offer you financial and product incentives to share what you’ve found out about yourself in an anonymous, safe wayThis is the Internet revolution we’ve been waiting for - claiming data from the Internet corporations who have been taking advantage of us for far too long!With the dawn of the Internet of Things, it’s time to take control of our connected lives and start benefiting from the new data rules.HAT stands for Hub Of All Things - because that’s what it is.With PEOPLE, at the centre of it.

How you be a part of The HAT and this data revolution?
We’re looking for £50,000 to help us transition from a funded university research project to an online platform that will benefit the public. This amount of money will help us get started on:

Launching HAT in beta with 1GB storage for every user from July 2016 (click here to check if and when HAT is available in your country).
Transitioning from beta to public within 3 months. 
Building the development community to build more apps to help you do more with your data, and write more code to bring more data in for ourselves.

We chose to go down the crowdfunding route because it’s important that we are all in this together as a community to collectively want our data from the Internet! We wanted to use Indiegogo to reach new people in the social movement to help people become more aware of their data online, and to start a revolution in the way people use the Internet.
There’s a lot more we dream of doing - but this will help us start on what we need to do first. And we want to hear from you - our supporters and future HAT users - on what you’d most like us to include and focus on. Talk to us on Facebook or Twitter or visit our website!
Perks for Indiegogo supporters
If our Indiegogo is successful, a standard HAT that includes 1GB storage, data plugs and use of Rumpel will be free for all our backers. We are asking Indiegogo supporters to help us make that happen and in return, you will be the first to get a HAT. 
Your HAT ID is not an email address. it's an actual IP address, your digital presence on the Internet, a microservice container. For Indiegogo earlybird and beta access users, you will be the first to get a preferred HAT address of name.hubofallthings.net - or name.hubat.net for short.
We’re opening the opportunity up for you to be an Associate member of the HAT Community Foundation through our Indiegogo campaign. Associate members will be consulted on future developments and have privileges such as being the first to test out new functionalities on the HAT, access to events, research papers and focus groups for feature evolutions. 
We also want to encourage companies to support the HAT and offer HATs to their customers! HAT Corporate supporters will be given priority for their product or service to be 'HAT ready', which means their customers can pull their data the corporation holds on them into their HATs.
 
If you back with more than £10 you’ll be a part of the HAT user community and will have an opportunity to invest in the HATDEX Company.
 
The HAT in more detail
The HAT is a private and secure cloud-based information system with storage and data processing abilities. It's your own microserver container. You can access your data and manage it from an easy-to-use dashboard, a hyperdata browser we call Rumpel. With Rumpel, you can access your HAT from a desktop and mobile devices.
If you are an expert user, you can install the HAT on your computer or other devices in your home or office (the hard HAT), or if you're like the rest of us, subscribe to a service provided by certified HAT platform providers (HPP) that are legally committed to ensure privacy, security and confidentiality. You can move your HAT between HPPs at any time. HPPs are regulated by the HAT Foundation.
COLLECT

HAT offers data plugs to claim your personal data from the Internet, your mobile and IoT wearables, and all those companies gathering, storing and selling information on you.
What do we mean by data? Where you are and where have you been, what you were listening to, what was in your diary, what you bought, what you searched, what you sent, what you photographed. Also your calendar, your email and more, the list goes on!
Who can you claim your data from? Google, Facebook, supermarkets, online stores, phone GPS, streaming services, transport companies, your broadband provider - anyone you can imagine. We’ll strive to add as many as possible to make your own HAT more data rich.

VISUALISE

Using Rumpel - the first ever hyperdata browser - you can see what different companies know about you.
Add the data only you know about yourself - your diary, habits, health, coffee preferences and more.
Put all of this data together and build a picture of yourself using all of these digital fragments.

CONTROL

YOU can choose what you do with this data.
You can keep it just for your enjoyment, information or peace of mind - to get to know yourself better and make smart choices online.
Or you can share it with friends and family without a third party being involved - to help making plans run smoother, or just for fun.
Or you can securely trade this valuable resource for reward credits, discount codes, money, recommendations.
Have you ever signed in to a service with your Google or Facebook account? Why should they be a custodian of your data? Now you can use your own HAT to sign in and actually control the data you share - using a ‘data debit’ - with others and terminate the data debit when you don't want to share it anymore!
And YES, we keep the control tight through the HAT APIs, following the Code of Practice in Privacy, Confidentiality, Security and Trust developed by the research project.

 
The HAT is not just a personal data container! It is truly a privacy preserving market platform for you to exchange and monetise your data with others. All market platforms need a regulator to ensure everyone abides by the rules of the market, especially with regard to privacy, security and confidentiality. The HAT market platform is regulated by the HAT foundation, a social enterprise grouping taking over from the 6-university multidisciplinary research project.With a HAT, you can The HAT functionality we’ll launch with will be:

1GB HAT as private (cloud) storage for your personal data with your preferred hostname hosted in your home region by July 2016. (Click here to check if your country is included in the HAT roll out.)
Data plugs to connect with your calendar, Facebook, iPhone location, Dropbox (and your photos from dropbox), Spotify, Withings, Fitbit, My Fitness Pal and Fibaro. (We will keep adding more data plugs - so if you have requests, let us know!)
Rumpel - the HAT hyperdata browser to manage, organise and exchange your personal data.
Applications from HAT platform providers.
APIs for developers to build lots of applications to offer rewards for your personal data. 
APIs for developers to build Rumpel plugins to do help you do more stuff with your data.


HAT in the press
 
Here's what the press are saying about the HAT: 
“If the HAT project’s model of data as a form of currency comes to pass, it will represent a turning point for businesses that have so far been helping themselves. The smart home, instead of being a bit creepy, could in future become a place where consumers hold the greatest power.” - Financial Times
“…the point of the HAT – the Hub of All Things – your personal capability to hold everything about you as privately as you wish and, moreover, to trade it on the open market if you so choose; a commodity of great value that will be sought after as industry shifts its attention towards ever-more personalized products and services to suit the way you live and work.” - Groupe Intellex
“The HAT therefore augments digitally sophisticated smart homes by empowering the individual to participate in the ‘personal data economy’, make better everyday decisions, and generate smarter monetary and time savings. As the HAT is obviously a very appealing concept to individuals and households, its adoption is widely anticipated to dramatically escalate once launched, thereby creating huge network effects.” – BIG Innovation Centre

How is The HAT different from other Personal Data Stores (PDS)?

The HAT is a database in your own Micro Server Container, whilst PDS are normally an account in a centralised database with many accounts). So a breach of admin level access on PDS usually exposes all users’ data, while the same breach on HAT would only expose one user’s data.
The HAT Personal Data Schema allows data from multiple verticals to be bridged and re-organised, even reorganising data points, while PDS tends to keep vertical data in their original forms.
The HAT's Direct Data Debits allow you to control what bundle you’d like to share, who to share with, when and how in a 'direct debit' manner, meaning you have full control, and can change your mind, even after your initial agreement to share the data, although you might no longer benefit from the exchange.
HAT is an exchange platform - all parties SSL certified, and communication enforced via the HAT APIs, and your all data exchanges are logged so that you know the journey of your data within the ecosystem.
The HAT network actually has a regulatory body and oversight through the HAT foundation and it regulates any party participating in the exchange ecosystem to act within the code of practice. HAT Foundation certification ensures every party “play nice” according to the rules, otherwise they may be excluded from the ecosystem.

Who can be a HPP?
Anyone can, as long as you meet the requirements of the HAT foundation for providing the HAT technology with an infrastructure that ensures privacy, security, confidentiality and trust. The technology created by the HAT research project has been released as open sourced and given out free so technically, if you wish to be your own HPP, you can as well. You would need to get yourself-as-HPP certified, otherwise you will be missing out on all the HAT services offering rewards and applications on HAT data. Many of our HATDEX certified HPPs often have their own extras services for your HAT data.

<p>Hello, my name is Mike Canfarelli and I am the President of SIMP Inc (Sales In My Pocket). As a prior door-to-door sales rep myself, I have created the Simplifying Sales App and Website to simplify the lives of door-to-door sales reps globally. <br/><br/>After many years of the traditional use of pen and paper, and with smartphone and tablet usage on the rise, this app could not come at a better time. Using my knowledge of the door-to-door sales industry, I have created a patented fool-proof tool for the iOS and Android markets in which will not only boost sales, but inspire door-to-door sales reps to be the best they can be. <br/><br/><strong>Patented Key App. Features include:</strong><br/>-Create and view saved routes with houses marked as ""Disgruntled, Sale, or Undecided,"" along with homeowner's name and contact information. <br/>-View Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly Sales Reports.<br/>-Create and view saved notes.<br/>-View inspirational videos,  quotes, sales pitches and mission statements for continuous motivation.<br/>-Keep track of upcoming bonuses and leader boards. <br/>-Send e-mails within the app.</p>

</h3>Over the past three months, a class of 12 students from the VCU Department of Graphic Design has organized a steamroller printmaking event to create large scale prints. <p>These students have been working on planning the event, designing the prints and hand-carving 6 linoleum blocks in order to create a limited series of 32""x44"" prints.</p><p>We want to rent a 1+ton steamroller (also known as an asphalt roller), a machine usually used for leveling asphalt roads. This steamroller will be driven over the hand-carved blocks of linoleum to transfer ink onto paper and create these large posters.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/457239/files/20140324164115-DSC_0012.jpg?1395704475"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>How We Roll<br/>
</h3><p>How will we print with a steamroller?</p><p>By hand-carving our designs into pieces of linoleum, of course! The process takes about two weeks, and will result in a mirror image relief of our designs. <br/></p><p>In addition to the limited series of prints being created, audience members will be able to witness the group's performance of hand inking the blocks, laying paper, providing pressure with a steamroller and finally showing the final printed places and hanging them to dry.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Event</h3>We're inviting art enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in watching live art action!<br/><br/>Come find us: <br/>325 North Harrison Street, Outside the Pollack Building <br/>April 11, 2014<br/>2pm-8pm<br/>Free to the Public<br/>Featuring music, local foodtrucks, and print sales<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>How You Can Help<br/>
</h3><p>Can't contribute monetarily? You can still help us reach our goal! Follow this campaign to see how we're doing. Share on Facebook or Twitter to get your friends to help us too.</p><p>If you're in Richmond, Virginia, then please stop by our event! Bring your friends! Bring your mom! Bring your dog! Listen to music, get some grub from local Richmond food trucks, and watch us print!</p><p></p><h3>Keith Fabry: Thank You!<br/>

Over the past three months, a class of 12 students from the VCU Department of Graphic Design has organized a steamroller printmaking event to create large scale prints. These students have been working on planning the event, designing the prints and hand-carving 6 linoleum blocks in order to create a limited series of 32""x44"" prints.We want to rent a 1+ton steamroller (also known as an asphalt roller), a machine usually used for leveling asphalt roads. This steamroller will be driven over the hand-carved blocks of linoleum to transfer ink onto paper and create these large posters.How We Roll
How will we print with a steamroller?By hand-carving our designs into pieces of linoleum, of course! The process takes about two weeks, and will result in a mirror image relief of our designs. In addition to the limited series of prints being created, audience members will be able to witness the group's performance of hand inking the blocks, laying paper, providing pressure with a steamroller and finally showing the final printed places and hanging them to dry.The EventWe're inviting art enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in watching live art action!Come find us: 325 North Harrison Street, Outside the Pollack Building April 11, 20142pm-8pmFree to the PublicFeaturing music, local foodtrucks, and print salesHow You Can Help
Can't contribute monetarily? You can still help us reach our goal! Follow this campaign to see how we're doing. Share on Facebook or Twitter to get your friends to help us too.If you're in Richmond, Virginia, then please stop by our event! Bring your friends! Bring your mom! Bring your dog! Listen to music, get some grub from local Richmond food trucks, and watch us print!Keith Fabry: Thank You!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Based in San Francisco, CA, our entrepreneurial team is bringing a new type of renewable electricity generation process to the market. The inventor, Cahill Maloney, developed the idea while watching the large barges and ships come and go on the San Francisco bay. Though imperceptible to the naked eye, he realized that these ships rise and fall a few feet every day with the incoming and outgoing tide.  Having garnered extensive mechanical expertise from years of repairing cars and building boats, he knew that the power and force of the movement of this massive amount of weight could be harnessed with a gearing system anchored to a stationary platform.  As the ship rises and falls a few feet every day with the incoming and outgoing tide, it would create an irresistible force, which could translate into the spinning of a turbine, and hence, electricity.  This energy would be ""lunar"", in that it would depend on the consistent tidal fluctuations.  More importantly, this consistent energy would address the shortcomings of the current renewable sources that can provide only intermittent energy, as they rely on the variable wind and solar conditions.  Nautical Torque, as this new process was dubbed, has the potential to become a disruptive technology and revolutionize the way we power ourselves with a consistent, ""always on"" electricity source that can replace fossil fuel and nuclear sources. </p>
<p>After pitching the idea to everyone from NASA to PG&amp;E to venture capitalists, we concluded that we need to build a proof of concept in order to spur funding and action.  The energy industry and society at large will not accept a disruptive innovation like ours without significant proof and evidence.  By maxing out credit cards, convincing friends and family to invest, and using ingenuity, we raised the initial capital necessary to obtain a patent and build our own preliminary working models and proofs of concepts.  We worked with and received advice from various experts in the fields of gear box manufacturing, renewable electricity, and wind turbines, which allowed us to work out the gearing ratios, test gearboxes, and measure the electricity to weight ratio.</p>
<p>Because a full scale seaside prototype (using a ship and the natural tide) remained too expensive without significant investors, we focused on building a landlocked version, which would use water cylinders and floating buoys to replicate the tidal movement and barges.  Through experimentation, and after destroying 6 gearboxes, we completed our working model, and discovered that the efficiency and energy gain is much higher than anyone expected.  Now, we've completed all the hard work of R&amp;D and have exhausted our personal resources, and we need $14,000 to buy the necessary parts for a complete prototype, which will provide data and evidence for the commercialization of this technology. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A full scale working prototype will introduce a new type of renewable electricity, which will help with the transition away from dirty sources of electricity such as nuclear and coal.  A working prototype demonstrates the scalability of the technology, evidence and data that will inspire investors to commit to future prototypes of the seaside version of nautical torque, which eventually could lead to nautical torque power plants on the scale of nuclear and natural gas power plants. </p>
<p>The consequences of not getting funded is that our idea wallows and is delayed for years. In this climate, in this time, it is essential to quickly get the word out about renewable energy possibilities, as the current transformation away from the use of our prescious natural resources is already underway.  Our technology, and its potential for utility scale baseload electricity can empower the alternative energy revolution.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We just need parts baby! </p>
<div><strong>$4500 Gearbox with 3000lb weight capacity and reinforced bearings to mitigate shock</strong></div>
<div><strong>$2000 Air Compressor, with muffler</strong></div>
<div><strong>$3500 Skystream Wind Turbine (minus the blades)  Turbine that gives 1kw/hr output</strong></div>

<div><strong>$1500 Grid Connect System (inverter, amp volt meters) breaker</strong></div>
<div><strong>$500 cables, connectors and miscellaneous hardware</strong></div>
<br/><p>To bring this technology to the market, our best hope is to have a working prototype to show energy companies, media outlets, utilities, business owners, investors, and even our political leaders. </p>
<p>What you get in return is first and foremost the participation in a grassroots effort to positively affect the energy debate in this country.  Decentralized technologies and projects like ours will form a major part of the solution to the climate crisis.   We believe our idea is worthy of funding and that people like you can decide that revolutionary ideas can come from normal working class people like us.  All the grants and venture capitalists seem to care more about P.H.Ds, and titles rather than sound ideas.  You can look at our idea and decide for yourself.   </p>
<p>Every donation of at least $5 will receive a Nautical Torque - I SUPPORT INNOVATIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY bumper sticker as well as personal acknowledgement on the website.</p>
<p>For $50, you'll receive a very cool 100% cotton t-shirt with the Nautical Torque Logo</p>
<p>For $100, you will receive a trucker hat with the nautical torque logo, bumper sticker and t-shirt</p>

<h3>Hi! My name is Mark and I created the Details Matter app. <span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>
</h3>
<h3>What is Details Matter? </h3>
<p><span>Details Matter is an app that encourages people to SHARE and BORROW date ideas. <span>Whether you are single or in a relationship you can always use new date ideas! Details Matter is the app that solves the biggest dilemma before going on a date: “Where should we go and what should we do?”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt=""Details Matter App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media.virbcdn.com/cdn_images/resize_1024x1365/f3/4808bf4574a465f2-Screenshot20130617at12257PM.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Details Matter App""/></span></span></p>
<h3>Why is Details Matter unique?</h3>
<p>There are literally hundreds of apps and web sites that tell you where you can go for a romantic dinner. However, there is not a website or app that can give you date ideas that are activity based. What if you don't want to eat food? Seriously, when did dinner become the only dating activity? Or if you don't want to grab a drink...what if you don't drink at all? Is your only answer to go to a movie? </p>
<p>The Details Matter app enables you to easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Find tons of creative activity-based date ideas </strong>like sunset kayaking, horseback riding, hiking trails, swing dance lessons and lots more. Dates that don't involve sitting at a table and eating food...Dinner is such a boring date!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Scroll through a list or search on ideas based on your geography </strong>by description, type of activity, location, and cost. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Add your own favorite date ideas anonymously for others to use! </strong>User generated ideas, so people like <strong>you create the content </strong>(not businesses). How cool is that?!!</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Plus we offer great Deals!!</strong></h3>
<p>The best part of the app is the <strong>great deals on date activities</strong> (how we make money). We partner with local businesses to offer discounts to awesome date ideas like <strong>""Buy one kayak rental get one free"", ""Buy one painting class buy one free""</strong> and lots more. We merge socially shared date ideas with businesses who want to give discounts on outside the box dating activities!</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">So, why the campaign?</span></h3>
<p>I created Details Matter because I couldn't find one simple place to find great date ideas. I was always looking for ways to make my dating life more engaging. I came to the conclusion that everyone must be looking for the same thing: creative, fun, and unique date ideas. I knew an app could be the solution. So, I pulled money together, found a local developer, and we built it together.</p>
<p>The app has been a great success with the little marketing money available. Now I need to launch in the next location, specifically in New York (anything in excess of our goal will go to launching in other major cities). I already have the blueprint for success in San Diego and now I need to take it to New York. If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere!! So, I am raising funds to launch the app in the Big Apple and this is where I need YOUR support.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What will the money be used for? </span></h3>
<p>For $25,000, I will be able to launch in the largest market in the U.S....<strong>New York City</strong>. In order to do this, I need capital to hire a local team of experts to engage new users, upload new activities, establish new partnerships for offers, and more. All of the money we raise, will go to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring a local Social Media and Public Relations Team to spread the word. </li>
<li>Bringing on a Street Team to work events. </li>
<li>Paying the fees for this campaign. </li>
</ul>
<p>If we raise $50,000, we'll also launch in <strong>San Francisco</strong>!!</p>
<p>If we raise $75,000, we'll also launch in <strong>Chicago</strong>!!</p>
<h3>Why should you support this campaign?</h3>
<p>I've taken a grassroots approach to fund and create the app and IT'S WORKING!! We have a <strong>5 OUT OF 5 STARS RATING in the App Store</strong>. But the only way to grow the app is to launch in new, bigger cities with the support of people like you.</p>
<p>My worst fear is that a bigger company who has an endless budget and greater marketing power will steal my concept. BUT, if we're able to raise enough funds, Details Matter will be the first app of its kind to market...<strong>So, help me get to market with my idea before the big businesses do!! </strong></p>

</div></span></span></div>","Hi! My name is Mark and I created the Details Matter app.  

What is Details Matter? 
Details Matter is an app that encourages people to SHARE and BORROW date ideas. Whether you are single or in a relationship you can always use new date ideas! Details Matter is the app that solves the biggest dilemma before going on a date: “Where should we go and what should we do?”

Why is Details Matter unique?
There are literally hundreds of apps and web sites that tell you where you can go for a romantic dinner. However, there is not a website or app that can give you date ideas that are activity based. What if you don't want to eat food? Seriously, when did dinner become the only dating activity? Or if you don't want to grab a drink...what if you don't drink at all? Is your only answer to go to a movie? 
The Details Matter app enables you to easily:


Find tons of creative activity-based date ideas like sunset kayaking, horseback riding, hiking trails, swing dance lessons and lots more. Dates that don't involve sitting at a table and eating food...Dinner is such a boring date!



Scroll through a list or search on ideas based on your geography by description, type of activity, location, and cost. 



Add your own favorite date ideas anonymously for others to use! User generated ideas, so people like you create the content (not businesses). How cool is that?!!

 

Plus we offer great Deals!!
The best part of the app is the great deals on date activities (how we make money). We partner with local businesses to offer discounts to awesome date ideas like ""Buy one kayak rental get one free"", ""Buy one painting class buy one free"" and lots more. We merge socially shared date ideas with businesses who want to give discounts on outside the box dating activities!

The app is already available and FREE to download through Google play and the App Store.  
   
In the Press
Even though we only had the budget to launch out of our hometown of San Diego , the app has been a huge success and we've gotten great media coverage...

So, why the campaign?
I created Details Matter because I couldn't find one simple place to find great date ideas. I was always looking for ways to make my dating life more engaging. I came to the conclusion that everyone must be looking for the same thing: creative, fun, and unique date ideas. I knew an app could be the solution.

I already have the blueprint for success in San Diego and now I need to take it to New York. If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere!! So, I am raising funds to launch the app in the Big Apple and this is where I need YOUR support.
What will the money be used for? 
For $25,000, I will be able to launch in the largest market in the U.S....New York City. In order to do this, I need capital to hire a local team of experts to engage new users, upload new activities, establish new partnerships for offers, and more. All of the money we raise, will go to: 

Hiring a local Social Media and Public Relations Team to spread the word.

Paying the fees for this campaign. 

If we raise $50,000, we'll also launch in San Francisco!!
If we raise $75,000, we'll also launch in Chicago!!
Why should you support this campaign?
I've taken a grassroots approach to fund and create the app and IT'S WORKING!! We have a 5 OUT OF 5 STARS RATING in the App Store. But the only way to grow the app is to launch in new, bigger cities with the support of people like you.

<h3>Celeum Technology</h3>
<p>At Celeum, we're passionate about open source. We aim to bring you devices that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use</li>
<li>Inexpensive</li>
<li>Better than proprietary solutions</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<br/><strong>We need your help</strong>
</h3>
<p>In order to mass produce our innovative devices, we're asking for your help. For just $10000 we can get a head start on manufacturing, lowering costs even further down the line. Your contribution won't be for nothing either - if you donate more than $199, a Celeum device will be shipped to you immediately following the end of our crowdfunding campaign (even if we <em>don't</em> make our goal).</p>
<p><br/>And now, for those of you who donate more than $99, we'll ship you our brand new design - the Celeum MiniPC!</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What we're planning</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Initially, we'll be making three devices, and you get your choice for a donation of $199 or more - a $30 savings compared to our regular price (after funding) of $229 Here's what you get to choose from:</p>
<p><strong>Celeum PC</strong></p>
<p>The Celeum PC is a fully functional, professional desktop computer for home and business. It comes with both Google’s Android and DickMacInnis.com’s <a href=""http://dreamstudio.dickmacinnis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DreamStudio</a> operating systems, along with office, graphics, video, audio, and internet apps, games, and thousands of additional software titles available through both Google Play and the Ubuntu Software Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>All preinstalled apps are full versions, and there are no additional demo apps or ads to remove.</li>
<li>Fully compatible with all popular formats, including Microsoft Office documents and Adobe Reader.</li>
<li>Professional graphic design, video editing, and audio production suite are standard thanks to DreamStudio.</li>
<li>Run all your favorite apps, like Angry Birds, Skype, and Google Chrome</li>
<li>Ultra portable form factor lets you take your desktop with you!</li>

<p><strong>Celeum Cloud Server</strong></p>
<p>The Celeum Cloud Server is your personal file sharing cloud, giving you the freedom of access you love in cloud sharing services like Dropbox and Google Drive, with the privacy of your own server. You’ll never have to worry about bringing your files with you, as you’ll always have access on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer, your iPhone or Android smartphone, or anywhere else you have internet access. The best part is: your files always stay in your care – they’re never stored on another company’s server, so <em>you</em> remain in control. Users can be added locally or authenticated with LDAP for seamless integration with your Celeum Domain Server or Active Directory server.</p>
<p>The web interface and secure shell are easy to use for remotely managing your Cloud Server, extra storage is easy to add, and there are many additional plugins available like shared calendars, instant messaging, and even audio and video players for important presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Celeum Domain Server</strong></p>
<p>The Celeum Domain Server is the perfect solution for business with up to 100 users or PCs. It’s 100% compatible with Microsoft’s Active Directory, and includes all the features you’d expect, like centralized login, user and group management, file and printer sharing, roaming profiles, DHCP, and DNS.</p>
<p>To provide maximum uptime, the Celeum Domain Server is designed with redundancy in mind. You can easily sync two Domain Servers for the ultimate in availability, and the entire running and configured system can be backed up in less than an hour. There are no moving parts in a Celeum Domain Server, meaning fewer points of failure than in a traditional domain controller. And even if disaster strikes, a functioning backup or live image can be deployed on a new Celeum Domain Server in less time than it takes to <em>boot</em> a Windows Server box.</p>
<p>The software is all open source and based on Linux – technology that’s trusted by everyone from Google to the New York Stock Exchange, and includes both an easy to use web interface and secure shell. Both can quickly be disabled for internet facing machines or in other situations where local access is preferred for security reasons.</p>
<p>All this hardware and software for less than the cost of a Windows Server license, and you’ll never have to worry about upgrade fees or per user licensing again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All three devices share the same hardware specifications, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quad Core 1.7ghz CPU</li>
<li>Quad Core GPU – HDMI output in full 1080p</li>
<li>2GB RAM</li>
<li>8GB eMMC system disk</li>
<li>Built in Ethernet</li>
<li>2 Full size USB ports</li>
<li>MicroSD for storage expansion up to 64GB</li>
</ul><p>The base for our systems is an Odroid-U2 with a Samsung Exynos 4412 CPU and Mali400 GPU.</p>

I'm glad you  asked...</p><p><br/></p><p>Knock Knock is an app created out of necessity.  I am an independent individual who likes to do things at a moment's notice.  So here I was out of town on business in a city that I wasn't familiar with, but I wanted to go out and enjoy what that city had to offer.  At this point what are my options....</p><p>1. Ask the concierge or front desk employee of my hotel what there is to do around town?</p><p>2.  Google search?</p><p>3.  Ask a passerby...?</p><p>In any of these scenarios I was putting the success of my night into the hands of a total stranger who 9 times out of 10 will base their suggestions on individual preferences.  <br/></p><p>After an evening of waiting in lines and stumbling into awkward environments, I had had enough!</p><p>That is why I created Knock Knock app..</p><p> <br/></p><p>Knock Knock will allow you to find whatever food, drink, book, or 
crowd that you are looking for.  In order to do so, you will be able to:</p><ul>
<li>Add favorites for quick look up of frequently visited destinations.</li>
<li>Receive special Knock Knock discounts from local businesses through push-notifications</li>
<li>Search for deals based on keywords</li>
<li>Create
 a friends list to be able to see if friends are out on the town.  
However, you also have the ability to make yourself invisible if you 
just want a quiet night out on the town.  See we thought of everything!</li>

I'm glad you  asked...Knock Knock is an app created out of necessity.  I am an independent individual who likes to do things at a moment's notice.  So here I was out of town on business in a city that I wasn't familiar with, but I wanted to go out and enjoy what that city had to offer.  At this point what are my options....1. Ask the concierge or front desk employee of my hotel what there is to do around town?2.  Google search?3.  Ask a passerby...?In any of these scenarios I was putting the success of my night into the hands of a total stranger who 9 times out of 10 will base their suggestions on individual preferences.  After an evening of waiting in lines and stumbling into awkward environments, I had had enough!That is why I created Knock Knock app.. Knock Knock will allow you to find whatever food, drink, book, or 
crowd that you are looking for.  In order to do so, you will be able to:
Add favorites for quick look up of frequently visited destinations.
Receive special Knock Knock discounts from local businesses through push-notifications
Search for deals based on keywords
Create
 a friends list to be able to see if friends are out on the town.  
However, you also have the ability to make yourself invisible if you 
just want a quiet night out on the town.  See we thought of everything!
Search for locations by keywords, destination types, gender, age groups, etc... 
See wait time for restaurants and other destinations

<p>The T-1000, 3D printer was produced through a perfect blend of professional expertise of our talented engineers and tech veterans coupled with the most state of the art and cutting edge technology in the industry. G3D has revolutionized the printing industry; by introducing the fastest, highest quality, and most accurate 3D printing system designed for the home users, but with quality to produce prints for dental and jewelry. <i>Lose those wired connections from the laptop or desktop to your 3D printer. Everything on the T-1000 is done thru Ethernet or WiFi</i></p>
<p>The innovative product measures almost 12 inches of vertical build height and is built to global industrial standards with a XY axis adjustable build size from 100 µm to 175 µm and adjustable quality to speed up printing on Z axis from 120 µm to 7.5 µm quality for everyday home use including fine prints for dental or jewelry. The T-1000 has a completely custom designed UV LED light engine that will keep you printing non-stop. It is a user friendly printer which is easy to setup with our patented self-leveling system. The Self Leveling System is highly essential when making successful 3D prints, time and time again; in combination with our super-flat build-plate surface for a supreme level build environment.</p>
<p>Global 3D Systems  focuses on offering to the market a 3D printer which offers a combination of speed, quality, reliability, and value as never been seen in the industry. With the power of the specific UV spectrum and resin pairing, the T-1000 will print extremely fast layers. G3D's greatest difference between laser and FDM is that our speed is not dependent on width or length of a printable object only height, 2.6+ inches an hour @ 120 µm layer thickness! (For instance, a cell phone case takes an average of 8-10 minutes max to print)<strong><i> So why print one toy soldier, when you can print an army!</i></strong></p>

Cloud storage will be a future feature. You can store all your prints in the cloud. Allowing reprinting at the press of a button.
The T-1000 is completely controllable from a tablet or phone with a web browser.
The T-1000 is warehoused in the United States by Expeditors providing all our logistics services powered by leading-edge technology, innovative solutions, and exceptional customer service.



The T-1000, 3D printer was produced through a perfect blend of professional expertise of our talented engineers and tech veterans coupled with the most state of the art and cutting edge technology in the industry. G3D has revolutionized the printing industry; by introducing the fastest, highest quality, and most accurate 3D printing system designed for the home users, but with quality to produce prints for dental and jewelry. Lose those wired connections from the laptop or desktop to your 3D printer. Everything on the T-1000 is done thru Ethernet or WiFi
The innovative product measures almost 12 inches of vertical build height and is built to global industrial standards with a XY axis adjustable build size from 100 µm to 175 µm and adjustable quality to speed up printing on Z axis from 120 µm to 7.5 µm quality for everyday home use including fine prints for dental or jewelry. The T-1000 has a completely custom designed UV LED light engine that will keep you printing non-stop. It is a user friendly printer which is easy to setup with our patented self-leveling system. The Self Leveling System is highly essential when making successful 3D prints, time and time again; in combination with our super-flat build-plate surface for a supreme level build environment.
Global 3D Systems  focuses on offering to the market a 3D printer which offers a combination of speed, quality, reliability, and value as never been seen in the industry. With the power of the specific UV spectrum and resin pairing, the T-1000 will print extremely fast layers. G3D's greatest difference between laser and FDM is that our speed is not dependent on width or length of a printable object only height, 2.6+ inches an hour @ 120 µm layer thickness! (For instance, a cell phone case takes an average of 8-10 minutes max to print) So why print one toy soldier, when you can print an army!


T-1000 with clear window (demo purposes actual units have UV protected red windows)


Our founder and CEO, Edward W. Machala, was the chief operating officer and treasurer of American Power Conversion (APCC). Through his direction and global strategies, the company grew from $15 million a year in revenues to approximately 4 billion. It was recognized as one of the fastest-growing companies on NASDAQ.
This company, APCC, was considered one of the world-class supply chains in the electronics industry. Their products were considered legendary in reliability as a result of their outstanding quality. Mr. Machala will implement the same successful strategies in the 3D print industry by providing outstanding quality, innovation and the most affordable solutions.

<h2>The Journey So Far...</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The patent pending Thayabi Coconut Holder / Splitter was developed specifically to address the difficulty of splitting
a coconut into two equal pieces while managing to preserve the valuable coconut
water. In addition to completing this task, this product firmly holds the
coconut once it is split, allowing for the safe grating or scraping of the
coconut meat.</p>
<p>For the past two years the
Thayabi Coconut Holder/Splitter has been in the concept development and design
stage. After creating numerous machined prototypes a viable design was
established. The final CAD model was then sent to an engineering company to
produce a rapid prototype. This 3D rapid prototype was used to extensively test
the complete system and make modifications as required. The functional testing ensured
that the Coconut Holder/Splitter ultimately was a robust and reliable
product. </p>

We believe that Indiegogo is a great stage for fundraising as it allows for consumers to be engaged and benefit from helping this product come to life. In addition to raising funds, the site will also help generate awareness of the product. Once we reach our funding goal we are confident that our product will be successful in the global market.    </p>

        </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #4D4D4D;"">
            ¿Por qué los canvas son tan útiles?
        </h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Canvapps es útil para capturar, gestionar y compartir todo tipo de información existente en Internet. Localiza en un solo lugar, tus fotos, vídeos, eventos, calendarios, notas, estados, localizaciones, restaurantes y absolutamente cualquier cosa que puedas imaginar. De un solo vistazo puedes ojear tus tarjetas o las de otros y organizarlo como quieras, tanto en orden como tamaño.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Además Canvapps permite el trabajo colaborativo con tus amigos, empresas o grupos de trabajo; crea un canvas, define sus permisos, añade las apps y ¡empieza a trabajar!
        </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #4D4D4D;"">
            ¿Cómo conecto con mis amigos y conocidos?
        </h2>

            Busca tus amigos o conocidos mediante la barra de búsqueda escribiendo el nombre. Haz click en conectar. Añádelo a una o varias de las listas que te proponemos o si lo prefieres crea tu propia lista en el cuadro de búsqueda.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Mediante el menú conexiones puedes gestionar tus contactos y redefinir la relación que tienes con ellos editando tus listas. Por ejemplo podrías tener las siguientes listas: amigos, conocidos, compañeros de trabajo, prensa… ¡lo que tú necesites!. Más adelante usarás estas listas para compartir contenido de una forma muy específica
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Además estamos trabajando en una herramienta de exportación de contactos de gmail, hotmail y otras plataformas.

<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #4D4D4D;"">
            ¿Qué es un filtro?
        </h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            ¿Cuántas de las personas que sigues en tus redes sociales son realmente amigos íntimos y te interesa lo que dicen? ¿Te gustaría poder filtrar de quién quieres ver publicaciones por grupos o personas?
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Los filtros son un conjunto de criterios que te ayudan a visualizar el contenido que más te interese en cada momento. Activa los filtros correspondientes a los grupos de tus listas (o para cada persona de forma individual) para ver qué han publicado.
        </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #4D4D4D;"">
            ¿Qué tipo de filtros tienes disponibles?
        </h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Actualmente tienes a tu disposición el filtrado por persona, grupo y organización para mostrar con exactitud el contenido solo de aquellos a quienes más te interesa seguir.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Estamos desarrollando un filtrado por app que te permitirá decidir qué apps quieres que se muestren en las cartas de tu muro y un filtrado temporal que te permitirá ver lo que se publicó entre dos fechas concretas o en un momento determinado del tiempo.
        </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #4D4D4D;"">
            ¿Cómo seré capaz de ajustar mi nivel de privacidad?
        </h2>

            La configuración de privacidad funciona mediante listas de conexiones y de una manera incremental. Existen 4 niveles de privacidad posibles que puedes seleccionar para tus canvas y tarjetas:

<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #4D4D4D;"">
            Why are canvas so useful?
        </h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Canvas are useful to embed, manage and share any kind of information you may find on the Internet. Integrate on a single place your pictures, videos, events, calendars, notes, status, locations, restaurants and anything else you can imagine. From a single sight you can see your cards or others and organize it as you want, from order to size.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Additionally Canvapps lets you work collaboratively with your friends, businesses or workgroups; create a canvas, set access rights, add apps and start co-working!

            How do I connect with friends and acquaintances?

            Find your friends and acquaintances through writing their name in the search bar. Then click in Connect. Add your friend to one or more lists that we give you by default or create your own in the text area.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Through the connections menu you can manage your contacts and redefine the relationship you have with them by editing your lists. As an example, you could have the following lists: friends, acquaintances, work colleagues, press... whatever you need! From now on you will use them to share content in a very specific way.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Additionally, we are currently working on an import app to let you retrieve your contacts from gmail, hotmail or other platforms.

            What is a filter?
        </h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            How many of the people you follow on social networks are really your friends and you care about what they say? Would you like to be able to filter from whom you want to see new posts, be it people or groups?
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Filters are a set of criteria that help you visualize the content you are most interested every time. Activate the corresponding filters to the groups of your lists (or to each person individually) to see what they published.
        </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #4D4D4D;"">
            What type of filters are available?
        </h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            Currently you can filter by person, group or organization to let you see only the content of those you are most interested in following.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
            We are developing an app filtering feature that will allow you to decide which apps you want to see cards from in your canvas and a time filtering feature that will allow you to see what was published between two set dates or at any given time.

            How will I adjust my privacy levels?

            Canvapps es una red social que te permite capturar y compartir cualquier tipo de contenido que puedas encontrar en Internet. Integra y gestiona esa información e incluso el de otros servicios como Facebook o Twitter usando una sola cuenta.
        
   
            Todo gracias al uso de cartas. Puedes compartirlas con tus amigos o simplemente guardarlas para ti usando listas personalizadas y un sistema de permisos exhaustivo y multinivel. Además puedes escoger el contenido que deseas visualizar de forma muy fácil, precisa y rápida con solo un par de clicks gracias al uso de filtros.
        

            SOCIAL COMO NINGUNA
        
   
            Nuestra intención no es inventar nuevas y extrañas normas sociales. Pero sí transformar y optimizar las actuales tras observar la forma en la que la gente se relaciona y qué esperan al hacerlo. Canvapps se propone traducir los comportamientos reales del día a día y crear un plataforma digital que pueda representar fielmente cualquier persona, grupo u organización y la forma en la que interactúan.
        

            FUNCIONAL PARA SERVIRTE
        
   
            Canvapps marca la diferencia al proporcionar una amplia selección de aplicaciones (apps) que facilitan que la información salte e interactúe de carta en carta. Unas cartas que lógicamente cambiarán de estado adecuándose a las transformaciones que vayan sufriendo. Cuando aparece una nueva aplicación, el conjunto entero de apps aumenta de funcionalidad exponencialmente.
        

            ¿CÓMO TE BENEFICIA DIRECTAMENTE?
        
   
            Podrás crear las listas de la forma que más te convenga, visualizar la información que creas conveniente y compartirla sólo con aquellos que desees.
        
   
            Además serás libre de decidir que apps son útiles y crear tus cartas sin esquemas rígidos. Canvapps es fácil de usar y permite crear soluciones increíbles independientemente del nivel técnico de cada usuario.
        

            ELEMENTOS DE CANVAPPS
        

            Cartas
        
   
            Las cartas se crean usando cualquier tipo de información que puedas llegar a imaginar. Desde imágenes o vídeos hasta un simple estado, pasando por calendarios o artículos de wikipedia por ejemplo. Las encontraremos dentro de nuestro canvas.
        

            Canvas
        
   
            Canvas es la superficie digital en la que creas y pones las cartas que contienen cualquier tipo de información que quieras compartir con tus amigos o incluso todo Internet.
        

            Aplicaciones (apps)
        
   
            Las apps son la parte más importante del concepto Canvapps. Serán concebidas para añadir flexibilidad y que te permitan hacer únicamente lo que necesitas. Sólo hay cabida para las opciones que te gustan y que son útiles para ti.
        

            Listas
        
   
            Las listas de conexiones son la mejor manera para compartir tu contenido de forma rápida con la gente que tú elijas. Y en el menú de filtros podrás explorar lo que más te interese en cada momento.
        

            NUESTROS VALORES
        
   
            Hace relativamente poco tiempo que estamos asistiendo a una revolución sin precedentes en el mundo de Internet. Cada día nacen nuevas plataformas y surgen nuevas necesidades, aumenta la complejidad y los abusos se suceden por la puerta de atrás.
        
   
            En Canvapps nos desmarcamos del silencioso uso y abuso del usuario y sus datos personales para fines comerciales. Canvapps provee un conjunto de herramientas gratuitas y premium con las que el usuario se convierte en parte de un entorno participativo y colaborativo.
        

            Transparencia
        
   
            Canvapps no usará tu información personal de forma ambigua ni contra tu consentimiento.
        
   
            No buscamos ingresos mediante publicidad intrusiva en tus contenidos ni mediante la venta de datos para fines comerciales. También somo usuarios de redes sociales y nos molesta tanto como a ti.
        

            Privacidad
        
   
            En Canvapps hemos trabajado duro para innovar e incrementar el control que tienes sobre tu propia información. Respetaremos lo que toda red social debería ser: un lugar donde seas tú y solo tú el que elija qué compartir, cuándo y dónde.
        
   
            Si te gusta tener el control cuando compartes, Canvapps será tu mejor aliado
        

            Poder para el usuario
        
   
            Canvapps aspira a construir una comunidad sólida donde las ideas y la creatividad puedan fluir para proporcionar mejoras constantes. Serán los propios usuarios quienes aportarán valor añadido a su propia red social.

            Facilidad de uso
        
   
            El diseño de Canvapps es simple, elegante y fácil de usar. Una plataforma sencilla, completa y potente te hará disfrutar de una experiencia única con tus amigos.
        
   
            Nuestro objetivo es conseguir que Canvapps llegue a ser una aplicación totalmente multiplataforma (funcional para distintos navegadores) y multidispositivo (funcional para distintos dispositivos).
        

            NUESTRO OBJETIVO DE CROWDFUNDING
        
   
            Nuestro objetivo para esta campaña de crowdfunding es obtener la financiación necesaria para lanzar la página y empezar a crecer.
        
   
            Actualmente disponemos de una versión funcional que ha entusiasmado a todos nuestros colaboradores y “testers” pero necesitamos tu ayuda para seguir con el desarrollo. Estamos muy motivados por este proyecto y queremos que confíes en nosotros y te unas a este maravilloso viaje. Puedes ser uno de los primeros en probar la página, compartir y -si te atreves- crear una de las primeras aplicaciones disponibles en Canvapps para los miles de personas que se irán uniendo a nosotros.

            FAQ
        

            ¿Qué es Canvapps?

            Un nuevo concepto de plataforma que te permite gestionar tus entornos real y virtual mediante una sola herramienta.
        

            ¿Por qué los canvas son tan útiles?
        
   
            Canvapps es útil para capturar, gestionar y compartir todo tipo de información existente en Internet. Localiza en un solo lugar, tus fotos, vídeos, eventos, calendarios, notas, estados, localizaciones, restaurantes y absolutamente cualquier cosa que puedas imaginar. De un solo vistazo puedes ojear tus tarjetas o las de otros y organizarlo como quieras, tanto en orden como tamaño.
        
   
            Además Canvapps permite el trabajo colaborativo con tus amigos, empresas o grupos de trabajo; crea un canvas, define sus permisos, añade las apps y ¡empieza a trabajar!
        

            ¿Cómo conecto con mis amigos y conocidos?
        
   
            Busca tus amigos o conocidos mediante la barra de búsqueda escribiendo el nombre. Haz click en conectar. Añádelo a una o varias de las listas que te proponemos o si lo prefieres crea tu propia lista en el cuadro de búsqueda.
        
   
            Mediante el menú conexiones puedes gestionar tus contactos y redefinir la relación que tienes con ellos editando tus listas. Por ejemplo podrías tener las siguientes listas: amigos, conocidos, compañeros de trabajo, prensa… ¡lo que tú necesites!. Más adelante usarás estas listas para compartir contenido de una forma muy específica
        
   
            Además estamos trabajando en una herramienta de exportación de contactos de gmail, hotmail y otras plataformas.
        

            ¿Qué es un filtro?
        
   
            ¿Cuántas de las personas que sigues en tus redes sociales son realmente amigos íntimos y te interesa lo que dicen? ¿Te gustaría poder filtrar de quién quieres ver publicaciones por grupos o personas?
        
   
            Los filtros son un conjunto de criterios que te ayudan a visualizar el contenido que más te interese en cada momento. Activa los filtros correspondientes a los grupos de tus listas (o para cada persona de forma individual) para ver qué han publicado.
        

            ¿Qué tipo de filtros tienes disponibles?
        
   
            Actualmente tienes a tu disposición el filtrado por persona, grupo y organización para mostrar con exactitud el contenido solo de aquellos a quienes más te interesa seguir.
        
   
            Estamos desarrollando un filtrado por app que te permitirá decidir qué apps quieres que se muestren en las cartas de tu muro y un filtrado temporal que te permitirá ver lo que se publicó entre dos fechas concretas o en un momento determinado del tiempo.
        

            ¿Cómo seré capaz de ajustar mi nivel de privacidad?
        
   
            La configuración de privacidad funciona mediante listas de conexiones y de una manera incremental. Existen 4 niveles de privacidad posibles que puedes seleccionar para tus canvas y tarjetas:
        

Sin acceso: Los otros usuarios no serán capaces de ver el elemento.
Acceso de visionado: Los usuarios serán capaces de ver elemento pero no de interactuar con  él.
Acceso interactivo: Los usuarios serán capaces de interactuar con el elemento.

            ¿Cómo son usados los filtros en Canvapps?
        
   
            Criterios de búsqueda que permite al usuario decidir exactamente qué contenido quiere explorar. Puedes seleccionar por listas de usuarios, tipos de tarjetas, precios,…

            Canvapps is a social network that allows you to embed and share any kind of content you may find on the Internet. Create new content and integrate information from services like Facebook or Twitter.        
   
            Everything is possible thanks to cards. You can share them with your friends or simply save them for yourself by using custom lists and an exhaustive multilevel access system. You can choose which content you want to see in an easy, precise and fast way with a couple of clicks when using filters.        

            AS SOCIAL AS NONE
        
   
            We do not aim to invent new social habits. But we do want to transform and improve current ones, after looking at how people interact and what they expect from it. Canvapps aims to move actual daily behaviours online and create a digital platform which can faithfully represent any person, group or organization and the way they behave with the world.
        

            FUNCTIONAL FOR YOU
        
   
            Canvapps stands out by providing a broad selection of apps to enable information to travel from one card to another. Cards that will adapt to the changes of their environment. When a new app gets in the system, the possibilities of the whole set of apps increases exponentially.
        

            WHERE DO YOU GAIN?
        
   
            You will be able to create lists as you want, visualize the information you believe to be relevant and share it with anyone. You will be free to pick the apps useful to you and create your cards in a flexible setting. Canvapps is easy to use and allows you to create great solutions independent from your technical knowledge.
        

            CANVAPPS ELEMENTS
        

            Cards
        
   
            You can create cards with almost any content you can imagine. From videos to images or a simple status, or for example a calendar or a wikipedia article. You will find them inside our canvas.
        

            Canvas
        
   
            Canvas is the digital board where you can create and position cards with any kind of content you want to share with your friends or even the whole Internet.
        

            Apps
        
   
            Apps are the key area to explain the Canvapps concept. Those will be designed to allow flexibility and to let you do whatever you want. There is only space for options that you like and find useful.
        

            Lists
        
   
            Connections lists are the best way to share your content easily with the people you choose. And at the filters menu you will be able to explore whatever you like whenever you want.
        

            OUR VALUES
        
   
            It has been a short time since we started to realize a new revolution without precedents in the Internet world. Every day new platforms are born and new needs are created, complexity grows and information abuse goes through closed doors.
        
   
            At Canvapps we do not condone those practices and we will not share personal data for commercial uses. Canvapps provides a set of free and premium tools through which the user becomes part of a collaborative environment.
        

            Transparency
        
   
            Canvapps will not use your personal information either ambiguously or without your consent.
        
   
            We are not looking to raise revenue through intrusive advertising between your content or through selling your data for commercial uses. We use social networks too and this bothers us as much as you.
        

            Privacy
        
   
            At Canvapps we work hard to innovate and increase your control over your own information. We will respect all things a social network should be: a place where you, and only you, chooses what to share, when and with whom.
        
   
            If you like being in control when you share, Canvapps will be your best ally.
        

            Power to the user
        
   
            Canvapps aims to build a solid community where ideas and creativity can flow to provide improvement opportunities. Users will be the ones to give value to their own social network.
        
   
            Be a part of our alpha phase from the start, create your own app and set you mark at Canvapps!
        

            Ease of use
        
   
            Canvapps design is simple, elegant and easy to use. A simple platform, powerful and complete will bring you a unique experience to enjoy with your friends.
        
   
            Our goal is for Canvapps to be a multiplatform (which can be used in different browsers) and multidevice (which can be used in different devices) application.
        

            OUR CROWDFUNDING GOAL
        
   
            Our crowdfunding goal is to get the necessary funding to jumpstart the website and start growing.

            Our goal is to create a unique social network, where you can find all types of people, groups and organizations sharing and working together. Our goal is to create a tool that allows you to manage your private and public lives as a whole.
        
   
            #ImagineCanvapps: close your eyes and imagine being able to embed any kind of content like a picture, a location, a minigame, a blog or an event, and be able to show  and manage them from a single place… all this and much more will be your new 2.0 social world.

            Why are canvas so useful?
        
   
            Canvas are useful to embed, manage and share any kind of information you may find on the Internet. Integrate on a single place your pictures, videos, events, calendars, notes, status, locations, restaurants and anything else you can imagine. From a single sight you can see your cards or others and organize it as you want, from order to size.
        
   
            Additionally Canvapps lets you work collaboratively with your friends, businesses or workgroups; create a canvas, set access rights, add apps and start co-working!
        

            How do I connect with friends and acquaintances?
        
   
            Find your friends and acquaintances through writing their name in the search bar. Then click in Connect. Add your friend to one or more lists that we give you by default or create your own in the text area.
        
   
            Through the connections menu you can manage your contacts and redefine the relationship you have with them by editing your lists. As an example, you could have the following lists: friends, acquaintances, work colleagues, press... whatever you need! From now on you will use them to share content in a very specific way.
        
   
            Additionally, we are currently working on an import app to let you retrieve your contacts from gmail, hotmail or other platforms.
        

            What is a filter?
        
   
            How many of the people you follow on social networks are really your friends and you care about what they say? Would you like to be able to filter from whom you want to see new posts, be it people or groups?
        
   
            Filters are a set of criteria that help you visualize the content you are most interested every time. Activate the corresponding filters to the groups of your lists (or to each person individually) to see what they published.
        

            What type of filters are available?
        
   
            Currently you can filter by person, group or organization to let you see only the content of those you are most interested in following.
        
   
            We are developing an app filtering feature that will allow you to decide which apps you want to see cards from in your canvas and a time filtering feature that will allow you to see what was published between two set dates or at any given time.
        

            How will I adjust my privacy levels?
        
   
            Privacy configuration works with connections lists and is graded incrementally.  There are 3 posible privacy levels which you can choose for your cards and canvas:
        

No access: Other users will not be able to see the item.
Interactive access: Users will be able to interact with the item, but not change it.
Edit access: Users will be able to edit the item configuration.

            How are filters being used at Canvapps?
        
   
            As search criteria that allow the user to decide exactly which content they want to explore. You can pick user lists, card types, prices...

But we need your help to:   Use the prototypes in a variety of ways with a variety of plant materials. Test the products for quality, reliability and usefulness.  Share your testing with the world at large.  In return, we are offering the complete line of products to you at our shipping cost ($50 USD).     What We Need & What You Get We just need 100 willing participants to test and review this new line of plant extraction equipment by contributing $50, and in return you get:   The ULTRA set of our equipment (CURE, SHAKE & SHATTER Kits). Free updates to the prototypes as they come online. To be the first to try out this product line before retail release.    The Impact Your impact to this product introduction is substantial, and global in nature:   Since we are a small team (2 designers and access to a small factory), we need user input from around the world who can test this product using indigenous plant materials that grow best in your local (Jasmine, Rose, Lavender, Rosemary, Mint, etc.). 
 By contributing, you are helping move forward a green and environmentally friendly way to extract plant materials without the use of chemicals, and in a way that can be done without electricity.  Your reviews after testing will help bring this simple technology to the entire world in a very valid and scientific way.    Risks & Challenges  While there is no risk at all really - we are finishing 100 sets of the product line as this story is being written - the challenge for us is to get the product into the hands of users who can fully test the capabilities of the product line, and then provide useful feedback that we can use to further refine the product line before releasing to the world at large.

<b>Protocloud is a cloud based tool dedicated to one thing: Prototyping.</b><br/>
    Before taking the expensive decision to write code, your concepts should be user tested in the real world. You cannot conduct usability testing early or often enough. Prototypes help you gauge how usable proposed solutions are, while engaging your clients and stakeholders more effectively. The problem is that developing and updating prototypes can easily be a time consuming effort.<br/><br/>Protocloud helps you re-purpose sketches and mock-ups you will need to create anyway, by allowing you to convert them into interactive prototypes. Its intuitive, easy to use and anyone in your team will be able to create prototypes as it requires no coding knowledge whatsoever; Product Managers, Content Writers, Visual Designers, Developers and generally anyone who knows how to use a mouse and keyboard.
</p>

<p>
    Presenting your ideas as static mock-ups is anything but ideal. You cannot convey an experience to non-designers from static mock-ups. Interactive prototypes are crucial to communicate your ideas to others better.
</p>
<p>
<b>Prototyping for any project.</b><br/>
    Be it a project for mobile, tablet or desktop, with Protocloud you have the perfect tool to create prototypes for any project you embark.
    <br/><br/><b>Tried and tested in the real world.</b><br/>
    We have been building Protocloud for the past 8 months. There is still work to do, but we are already using it in our daily work... and it just works. We have also supplied the tool to people we know who work in the industry to use themselves which have given us feedback and helped us shape the great tool it is today. <strong>User testing ideas is a hundred times more efficient and clients are instantly engaged.</strong>
<br/><br/><b>Cause you can see the outputs and results right now!</b><br/>
    Click the button below to see a sample app we created as a demo. We designed the mock-ups and then used Protocloud to make them interact with each other.

<p>Apart from sharing your project prototypes with anyone, the Premium plan will feature Protocasts which will allow you to communicate your concepts and ideas to your clients more effectively by being able to visually demonstrate an audience how the proposed solution works. Think of it as screencasting but for prototypes and without latency issues. Everyone can take part and anyone can take the lead.</p>

<p>
    Creating interactions takes seconds. Draw hotspots by drawing boxes on top of your sketches or graphical mock-ups and bring them to life in a fast and easy way with no coding whatsoever. Sidebars, modal dialogues, headers and footers are just a few of the things you can do with it.

    The prototype viewer mimics the device's behaviours. Touch projects (phone and tablet) require drag and move to scroll. The prototype is displayed in the device you set and viewers can leave feedback if you allow it.

    All the editor's features are available at any plan level. The basic plan starts at just 10€ a month with 100MB storage space. If you want to share your prototype demos and collect feedback, the Standard and Premium plans are very similar, the only difference is on the Standard plan you get 500MB while on the premium you get 1000MB as well as the Protocast feature.

<p>
    As of today, Protocloud is a side pet project. We like how it's shaping out and we would like to make it a full-time commitment. To do that, we need to attract people to use Protocloud. By setting up an Indiegogo campaign, we can find the people who are excited to use Protocloud as much as we are to build it. This will in turn generate funds which allows us to invest all out time and efforts in it.
    <br/><br/>
    Protocloud has gone through various changes already before we decided to release it to the public. Once we launch, any discovered bugs will be given priority and fixed. We have setup a monitoring system which notifies us immediately when javascript errors occur so we can address them as they happen. The funding target is a relatively low one, but since this will be a subscription based tool, we should be able to keep generating enough funds through customer retention.

    The utmost priority for us is simplicity. We want a tool that hides complexity underneath an easy to use UI. We will make sure to add features if relevant to most of our users, not just for the sake of adding it and be in line with our competition. Protocloud does not have all the features competitors do, but we believe it is simpler to use. We of course intend to keep adding supported devices and a bunch of new features are already in the pipeline (a.k.a. our Trello board). The challenge for us will be adding these new features while not compromising the simplicity of using the tool.

</p></div>","Reduce code, reuse assets, work smarter.

Protocloud is a cloud based tool dedicated to one thing: Prototyping.
    Before taking the expensive decision to write code, your concepts should be user tested in the real world. You cannot conduct usability testing early or often enough. Prototypes help you gauge how usable proposed solutions are, while engaging your clients and stakeholders more effectively. The problem is that developing and updating prototypes can easily be a time consuming effort.Protocloud helps you re-purpose sketches and mock-ups you will need to create anyway, by allowing you to convert them into interactive prototypes. Its intuitive, easy to use and anyone in your team will be able to create prototypes as it requires no coding knowledge whatsoever; Product Managers, Content Writers, Visual Designers, Developers and generally anyone who knows how to use a mouse and keyboard.

Why use it?

    Presenting your ideas as static mock-ups is anything but ideal. You cannot convey an experience to non-designers from static mock-ups. Interactive prototypes are crucial to communicate your ideas to others better.


Prototyping for any project.
    Be it a project for mobile, tablet or desktop, with Protocloud you have the perfect tool to create prototypes for any project you embark.
    Tried and tested in the real world.
    We have been building Protocloud for the past 8 months. There is still work to do, but we are already using it in our daily work... and it just works. We have also supplied the tool to people we know who work in the industry to use themselves which have given us feedback and helped us shape the great tool it is today. User testing ideas is a hundred times more efficient and clients are instantly engaged.
Cause you can see the outputs and results right now!
    Click the button below to see a sample app we created as a demo. We designed the mock-ups and then used Protocloud to make them interact with each other.
    
  Opens in a new window

Reinvent your pitches and demos.
Apart from sharing your project prototypes with anyone, the Premium plan will feature Protocasts which will allow you to communicate your concepts and ideas to your clients more effectively by being able to visually demonstrate an audience how the proposed solution works. Think of it as screencasting but for prototypes and without latency issues. Everyone can take part and anyone can take the lead.
Check out a Protocast video

An intuitive UI that makes sense.

    Creating interactions takes seconds. Draw hotspots by drawing boxes on top of your sketches or graphical mock-ups and bring them to life in a fast and easy way with no coding whatsoever. Sidebars, modal dialogues, headers and footers are just a few of the things you can do with it.
    
Demoing prototypes easily and effectively.

    The prototype viewer mimics the device's behaviours. Touch projects (phone and tablet) require drag and move to scroll. The prototype is displayed in the device you set and viewers can leave feedback if you allow it.
    
Watch Protocloud in action

Key benefits

Made for everyone...
High fidelity prototypes are usually built with HTML and javascript. These require both the skill and time if you want something that can be user tested. With Protocloud you replace HTML with drawing boxes and instead of days you take minutes.











...priced for anyone
Protocloud will be a subscription based service. Whether you're an employee working for a business, a freelance designer or just a design junkie, Protocloud is priced to accommodate everyone. You primarily pay for storage space and it's up to you how to manage that space. No project count restrictions or expensive price tags.





Sharing is caring

        Show your stakeholders or colleagues your progress via a link or email. No design is perfect at the first attempt. Sharing a working prototype is the best way to engage people.
        User testing? no problem! You can easily provide a link to your testers, including ones from widely popular services such as usertesting.com.
    











Collect feedback and act upon it

        Sharing without the ability to leave feedback wouldn't be right. Protocloud lets people post feedback on the project at hand and relate it to either the project in general or a specific screen.
        
        You will be able to see this feedback in a to-do list style for you to go through and mark the comments you addressed. Simple.
    





Cloud based
Need to access your projects from home, the office or whilst abroad? Like most software now-a-days, this is no different. The service is cloud based, accessible anywhere with an internet connection.











All your projects in one place
The projects dashboard features a bird's eye view of all your projects. You might be looking at sealing a deal with a new client. Access the dashboard and show him any current or past job easily.




A pricing model that fits any wallet.

    Whether you work freelance, have a small design firm, a design agency or work in a design team within a company, the pricing plans are very affordable.
    
    All the editor's features are available at any plan level. The basic plan starts at just 10€ a month with 100MB storage space. If you want to share your prototype demos and collect feedback, the Standard and Premium plans are very similar, the only difference is on the Standard plan you get 500MB while on the premium you get 1000MB as well as the Protocast feature.

<p>In a world in which we
increasingly tend to focus on our own wellbeing, one thing has become
particularly important to us at Foodlr: doing some good for others.</p>
<p>More than half of our food
ends up being binned. Abundance can lead to wastefulness and dealing with food
in unconscious ways. At Foodlr we want to contribute to at least preserving
small amounts of food by making them accessible to others. </p>
<p>How can we achieve this?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437387433/xryllrpcrb5n6zkalqnn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>With the Foodlr app. </p>
<p>More specifically with a
community that cares about sharing and the wellbeing of one another. </p>
<p>We created an app that
allows people to share food that they don’t eat themselves, e.g. because they
have cooked a too big portion. You can place homemade foods on Foodlr and
someone who e.g. is not free to cook can come to pick it up.</p>
<p>What you charge for a meal
is up to you.</p>
<p>Besides avoiding good food
being wasted Foodlr brings along an additional value: you will discover new
foods and dishes, you may have never tried out before.</p>
<p>Try out food from
different cultures and diets and discover new passions.</p>
<p>Our beta-version is
already available and free of charge. As common to beta-versions we are still
working on fixing some bugs. Furthermore we are still implementing additional
features to make it even easier for you to share foods.</p>
<p>To be able to further
develop the app and therefor make it more attractive for a larger group of
people we count on your support.</p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","In a world in which we
increasingly tend to focus on our own wellbeing, one thing has become
particularly important to us at Foodlr: doing some good for others.
More than half of our food
ends up being binned. Abundance can lead to wastefulness and dealing with food
in unconscious ways. At Foodlr we want to contribute to at least preserving
small amounts of food by making them accessible to others. 
How can we achieve this?




With the Foodlr app. 
More specifically with a
community that cares about sharing and the wellbeing of one another. 
We created an app that
allows people to share food that they don’t eat themselves, e.g. because they
have cooked a too big portion. You can place homemade foods on Foodlr and
someone who e.g. is not free to cook can come to pick it up.
What you charge for a meal
is up to you.
Besides avoiding good food
being wasted Foodlr brings along an additional value: you will discover new
foods and dishes, you may have never tried out before.
Try out food from
different cultures and diets and discover new passions.
Our beta-version is
already available and free of charge. As common to beta-versions we are still
working on fixing some bugs. Furthermore we are still implementing additional
features to make it even easier for you to share foods.
To be able to further
develop the app and therefor make it more attractive for a larger group of
people we count on your support.




In your area




Here you can see who is cooking in your area and what he or she is
cooking, as well as when to order and pick up food. Through images and detailed

Let it be your favorite dish, a family recipe, a culinary adventure
or simply pasta with tomato sauce, put on your chef’s hat and put your cooking

your friends.
Search


If you are looking for something in particular, or you want to limit your search to certain categories you can use our search feature. You can also restrict your search to a certain area.

about our upcoming product, the Symphony by Big Rig Technologies.  The 
Symphony is actually a line of products that were designed from the 
ground up to be as modular as possible allowing you to customize the 
perfect grow system that's right for you.  They were also designed to 
take the guess work out of growing for those less skilled and to make it
 easier to run perpetual grows for even the most experienced growers.  
Many of us are too busy with other tasks to take the time to grow our 
own produce.  That's about to change because now the system runs the 
grow for you and even sends you reminder emails for minor tasks such as 
filling tanks as they run low. The Symphony is a complete all-in-one 
system that grows your crops, so you don't have to.</p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Symphony products are built around a Linux server that 
processes all data pertinent to your grow and allows functionality and 
control never before offered in a growing platform.  Being a 
full-fledged server offers the capabilities of networked components both
 at your location and across the web.  It also allows you to add 
components over time such as speakers, webcam(s), USB foggers, 
ozonators, etc.  There are many useful USB devices we can already apply 
to the system and incorporate but mostly it's the devices we haven't 
made yet that make this system so exciting to us.  We have a wealth of 
add-ons planned but we can't speak of them yet without breaking the 
rules so let's focus on what it does right now.</figure><h1>
<br/>Feed and Control Module</h1><p>Each Symphony system comes with a 
Feed and Control Module.  FCMs are also available separately for people 
that have existing grow systems they want to add possibility to, 
enabling real-time networked access to their grow.  <i><b>Feed and Control Modules can also be used to control your fish aquarium and feed your fish!!!</b></i> 
 With our Android and iPhone apps you can monitor and control your 
system from anywhere and with our peer to peer platform you can connect 
to everybody in the Symphony network to buy, sell, trade and share your 
own products and progress!</p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>Our prototype module was hand-welded using High Density Polyethylene 
(or HDPE), a non-leeching food-grade polymer.  We are raising money for 
various aspects of our mass-production vision, injection molds being a 
key element.  All together we will need 5 molds made so we can have our 
parts mass produced: The Feed and Control Module, Grow Box, a 6 gallon 
tank and a 30 gallon tank for the 2nd Symphony.  Injection molded 
components will be made of food grade HDPE as well to keep you and your 
crops as healthy as possible!</p><p>Our initial FCM has 5 individual 
tanks, 2 for PH levelling (- and +) and 3 for nutrient solutions.  
Fluids are pumped from these tanks on an as needed basis controlled by 
our program running on the built-in Linux server.  For prototyping 
purposes we used the Arduino platform stacked with an Arduarium 
(aquarium control module) and connected via serial bus to a MK808 mini 
Android PC rooted for Linux.  </p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>This brings us to another necessity for funds.  We are having 
our proprietary boards made by an incredible company that did contract 
work for the Seawolf Sub class.  This means that all our boards will be 
built to military specifications and will be waterproofed as well adding
 yet another degree of safety on top of all the waterproofing we've 
incorporated into our designs.  </p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>While our main board will reside in the Feed and Control 
Module, a second smaller board will be produced that handles power needs
 and relay switching for main lights and pump.  It will also include 
some other features such as sub-woofer output.  This board will reside 
in the IP67 rated power control module located underneath the grow box 
hidden out of sight.  Our current power box was wired with a 
custom-built surge-protection circuit and Arduino relays.</p><h1>Lighting</h1><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>Our current lighting solution is a 20,000 lumen 4-bulb fluorescent 
fixture that can be adjusted from plant canopy height to 3 feet above 
the main platform.  We are developing options for all types of lighting 
solutions to attach to our rigs. In fact, all Symphonies are designed to
 accept future electronic lighting platforms.</p><h1>Electronics Configuration</h1><p>We
 have been working with a board developer and have a fast turnaround ETA
 of 1 week to prototype both boards as soon as funds are released.  Our 
main boards will be standard mini ITX form factor motherboards with 
added circuitry and ports for probe connection (PH, EC/TDS, ORP, temp, 
etc).  We will be using AMDs line of APU chips that incorporate both CPU
 and video processing into one chip, this saves us room on the board for
 those other circuits.</p><h1>Hardware Customization</h1><p>On to the 
bigger items, our initial grow system that you see here, The Little Big 
Rig, is a wall-mountable single-box aeroponic system.  The frame 
measures 16"" x 48"" x 60"" and has a built-in 8-port powered USB hub which
 allows you to add components over time. </p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>The frame is made of 2"" x 2"" square aluminum tubing and painted white
 for reflectivity with an added clear coat so it stands the test of 
time.  The tubing allows us to keep wiring out of sight and safe from 
water and it also allows us to customize the systems with ease for 
stacking and added hardware such as casters if you want your system to 
be mobile so you can roll your plants into the sun.</p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>Lids for the grow boxes are black on the inside to protect 
against mold and white on top for reflectivity.  You can choose 
different lids depending on the type of crop you plan to grow.  We offer
 lids with ports for 2"" cups giving you 24 grow sites, 3"" cups providing
 12 grow sites, and 6"" cups providing 4 grow sites for large plants.  </p><h1>Growbox</h1><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>Grow boxes come in one standard size of 12"" x 48"" x 10"".  This is 
double the depth of most systems on the market allowing for longer root 
systems and dual function boxes.  When you order your system just 
specify if you want the aeroponic option or flood and drain and your 
system will arrive with the proper plumbing components.</p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>A few minor things will differ from the prototype pictured to the 
product you will receive.  These are all positive changes of course and 
they are enhancements from the original, basically just some things that
 were not in our budget from the start.  For one, all rack posts will be
 adjoined by an internal stainless steel coupler for extreme rigidity 
and strength.  Injection molds may vary the look of our tanks and boxes 
but only slightly.  A more practical mounting solution will be in place 
for lighting modules which will utilize square collars.  Our main pump 
filter will be inline as opposed to inside the main holding tank.  </p><p>The
 Feed and Control Modules will end up around 2"" to 3"" narrower in width 
making the modules look sleeker.  We simply needed more room in the 
electronics portion of the prototype module for the stacked components 
we were using.  The amount of wires needed to connect the FCM to the 
grow rig will be reduced to one or 2 wires max.  Outside of those 
small items the only thing guaranteed to change is the amount of added 
abilities to our app and fully populated lists of hundreds of different 
fruit and vegetable types available as immediate default Grograms with 
an infinite amount available in the years to come.  </p><h1>Mobile App</h1><p>This
 brings us to the app.  Our app was initially written for Android but we
 have recently brought another programmer on board to port it over to 
iPhone.  We have made sure from the start that you will be able to enjoy
 the Symphony no matter what OS you are familiar with.  As of now our 
app has 5 core buttons on our main screen.  The Setup button allows more
 experienced growers to customize their grow from the start.  All system
 parameters and equipment can be individually logged and titled by the 
user and stored in a custom recipe we call a ""grogram"".  Grograms can be

 Rig Technologies Inc. is set up as a design and assembly firm.  As a 
start-up we do not currently possess the capabilities to manufacture all
 system components in-house.  This is why we have set up a supply chain 
with various manufacturers that provide us with all the raw materials 
for the Symphony product line.  System frames are made of standard 2"" x 
2"" square aluminum tubing that we order in bulk from an American metals 
firm with all parts coming to us already cut to the proper dimensions 
with all holes jet-water cut per the CAD files we've uploaded to them. 
We have also partnered up with a local paint shop that applies primer, 
paint and clear coat to all frame components.  We have arranged for bulk
 HDPE plumbing components, nozzles, and nuts and bolts components across
 multiple parts providers so that we don't end up in a position where we
 will run out of parts at any time and our suppliers can handle massive 
bulk orders as needed.  </p><p>Pumps for the Feed and Control Modules 
are manufactured by Vovyo and we are proud to have them on-board as a 
parts provider simply due to the fact that the pumps are tough as nails 
and almost completely silent.  We have partnered up with a company that 
is willing to share in the set-up costs of our molds for all plastics 
components ie. boxes/cases with the firm knowledge that they remain our 
plastic components supplier for the next few years.  We have a similar 
arrangement with our circuit board developer/provider wherein they share
 part of the design and set-up cost with the full knowledge that they 
will be our sole board provider for years to come.  Finally, we have 
partnered up with a wiring company that provides our custom wiring 
harnesses to connect all components and modules and 8-port USB hub.  
Once all components arrive in-house we will have an assembly line that 
is set up to fulfill orders exactly as placed.  Tickets are filled on 
the basis of components selected by our customers (ie. which tier/model 
ordered) and all components will be selected, wiring/ports installed, 
logos added, parts tested and inspected, and finally boxed and shipped 
to customers.  </p><br/></div>","Thank you for taking the time to learn 
about our upcoming product, the Symphony by Big Rig Technologies.  The 
Symphony is actually a line of products that were designed from the 
ground up to be as modular as possible allowing you to customize the 
perfect grow system that's right for you.  They were also designed to 
take the guess work out of growing for those less skilled and to make it
 easier to run perpetual grows for even the most experienced growers.  
Many of us are too busy with other tasks to take the time to grow our 
own produce.  That's about to change because now the system runs the 
grow for you and even sends you reminder emails for minor tasks such as 
filling tanks as they run low. The Symphony is a complete all-in-one 
system that grows your crops, so you don't have to.
Symphony products are built around a Linux server that 
processes all data pertinent to your grow and allows functionality and 
control never before offered in a growing platform.  Being a 
full-fledged server offers the capabilities of networked components both
 at your location and across the web.  It also allows you to add 
components over time such as speakers, webcam(s), USB foggers, 
ozonators, etc.  There are many useful USB devices we can already apply 
to the system and incorporate but mostly it's the devices we haven't 
made yet that make this system so exciting to us.  We have a wealth of 
add-ons planned but we can't speak of them yet without breaking the 
rules so let's focus on what it does right now.
Feed and Control ModuleEach Symphony system comes with a 
Feed and Control Module.  FCMs are also available separately for people 
that have existing grow systems they want to add possibility to, 
enabling real-time networked access to their grow.  Feed and Control Modules can also be used to control your fish aquarium and feed your fish!!! 
 With our Android and iPhone apps you can monitor and control your 
system from anywhere and with our peer to peer platform you can connect 
to everybody in the Symphony network to buy, sell, trade and share your 
own products and progress!

Our prototype module was hand-welded using High Density Polyethylene 
(or HDPE), a non-leeching food-grade polymer.  We are raising money for 
various aspects of our mass-production vision, injection molds being a 
key element.  All together we will need 5 molds made so we can have our 
parts mass produced: The Feed and Control Module, Grow Box, a 6 gallon 
tank and a 30 gallon tank for the 2nd Symphony.  Injection molded 
components will be made of food grade HDPE as well to keep you and your 
crops as healthy as possible!Our initial FCM has 5 individual 
tanks, 2 for PH levelling (- and +) and 3 for nutrient solutions.  
Fluids are pumped from these tanks on an as needed basis controlled by 
our program running on the built-in Linux server.  For prototyping 
purposes we used the Arduino platform stacked with an Arduarium 
(aquarium control module) and connected via serial bus to a MK808 mini 
Android PC rooted for Linux.  
This brings us to another necessity for funds.  We are having 
our proprietary boards made by an incredible company that did contract 
work for the Seawolf Sub class.  This means that all our boards will be 
built to military specifications and will be waterproofed as well adding
 yet another degree of safety on top of all the waterproofing we've 
incorporated into our designs.  
While our main board will reside in the Feed and Control 
Module, a second smaller board will be produced that handles power needs
 and relay switching for main lights and pump.  It will also include 
some other features such as sub-woofer output.  This board will reside 
in the IP67 rated power control module located underneath the grow box 
hidden out of sight.  Our current power box was wired with a 
custom-built surge-protection circuit and Arduino relays.Lighting

Our current lighting solution is a 20,000 lumen 4-bulb fluorescent 
fixture that can be adjusted from plant canopy height to 3 feet above 
the main platform.  We are developing options for all types of lighting 
solutions to attach to our rigs. In fact, all Symphonies are designed to
 accept future electronic lighting platforms.Electronics ConfigurationWe
 have been working with a board developer and have a fast turnaround ETA
 of 1 week to prototype both boards as soon as funds are released.  Our 
main boards will be standard mini ITX form factor motherboards with 
added circuitry and ports for probe connection (PH, EC/TDS, ORP, temp, 
etc).  We will be using AMDs line of APU chips that incorporate both CPU
 and video processing into one chip, this saves us room on the board for
 those other circuits.Hardware CustomizationOn to the 
bigger items, our initial grow system that you see here, The Little Big 
Rig, is a wall-mountable single-box aeroponic system.  The frame 
measures 16"" x 48"" x 60"" and has a built-in 8-port powered USB hub which
 allows you to add components over time. 

The frame is made of 2"" x 2"" square aluminum tubing and painted white
 for reflectivity with an added clear coat so it stands the test of 
time.  The tubing allows us to keep wiring out of sight and safe from 
water and it also allows us to customize the systems with ease for 
stacking and added hardware such as casters if you want your system to 
be mobile so you can roll your plants into the sun.
Lids for the grow boxes are black on the inside to protect 
against mold and white on top for reflectivity.  You can choose 
different lids depending on the type of crop you plan to grow.  We offer
 lids with ports for 2"" cups giving you 24 grow sites, 3"" cups providing
 12 grow sites, and 6"" cups providing 4 grow sites for large plants.  Growbox

Grow boxes come in one standard size of 12"" x 48"" x 10"".  This is 
double the depth of most systems on the market allowing for longer root 
systems and dual function boxes.  When you order your system just 
specify if you want the aeroponic option or flood and drain and your 
system will arrive with the proper plumbing components.

A few minor things will differ from the prototype pictured to the 
product you will receive.  These are all positive changes of course and 
they are enhancements from the original, basically just some things that
 were not in our budget from the start.  For one, all rack posts will be
 adjoined by an internal stainless steel coupler for extreme rigidity 
and strength.  Injection molds may vary the look of our tanks and boxes 
but only slightly.  A more practical mounting solution will be in place 
for lighting modules which will utilize square collars.  Our main pump 
filter will be inline as opposed to inside the main holding tank.  The
 Feed and Control Modules will end up around 2"" to 3"" narrower in width 
making the modules look sleeker.  We simply needed more room in the 
electronics portion of the prototype module for the stacked components 
we were using.  The amount of wires needed to connect the FCM to the 
grow rig will be reduced to one or 2 wires max.  Outside of those 
small items the only thing guaranteed to change is the amount of added 
abilities to our app and fully populated lists of hundreds of different 
fruit and vegetable types available as immediate default Grograms with 
an infinite amount available in the years to come.  Mobile AppThis
 brings us to the app.  Our app was initially written for Android but we
 have recently brought another programmer on board to port it over to 
iPhone.  We have made sure from the start that you will be able to enjoy
 the Symphony no matter what OS you are familiar with.  As of now our 
app has 5 core buttons on our main screen.  The Setup button allows more
 experienced growers to customize their grow from the start.  All system
 parameters and equipment can be individually logged and titled by the 
user and stored in a custom recipe we call a ""grogram"".  Grograms can be
 bought, sold, traded or shared over our peer to peer platform, another 
function available through the app or your preferred OS.




For new beginners, the ""Start A Grow"" button brings you to a basic 
screen with a search function.  Type in your desired crop type and you 
are presented with a list from which to choose your desired crop.  Once 
you've selected your option a screen pops up that directs you to add the
 necessary ingredients.  Once you've added your ingredients and tap 
""Start Grow"" the system takes over and your crops are under way! 
The ""Monitor and Control"" screen allows you to see all of the most recent data from sensors such as:
Air Temperature
Humidity
pH
Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP)
Electrical Conductivity (EC)
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
Water Temperature
Main Tank Level
Nutrient and pH (Acid and Base) buffer levels
Future expansion!
The sensors directly monitor the grow and will inject 
nutrients and pH buffers automatically.The monitor and control screen 
also allows you to view a timelapse of the grow, webcam and select what 
songs you want to play to the plants to keep them comfortable.
Each nutrient tank and pH buffer can also be manually injected 
into the system in case you're experimenting with a new compost tea, or 
some magic potion.

When pressing on any one of the live feeds, you can open a graph of 
the history of that particular sensor on an App or even any personal 
computer. This allows you to fine-tune your future grows and experiment 
with new grograms and nutrient mixtures.
Whenever any one of your tanks are low, an email is sent to you as reminders for refilling the tanks.2nd Symphony

</div></div>","PowerCloud brings a power strip renaissance as the world’s first to achieve the highest PD 65W USB output in the smallest enclosure on the market. It establishes the standard for future USB power strips by providing higher speed charges for all your appliances including laptops while eliminating the need for adapters.Functionality doesn’t have to come at a cost of good design. Adopting a tradition-defying look, sleek outline and fireproof glossy coating, PowerCloud transcends into a sophisticated desktop powerhouse to keep a complete workstation and entertainment center fully powered and charged.It is a must-have essential for working from home. If you are busy working to a tight schedule at home in the presence of your family, Powercloud automatically keeps all the cords and devices organized so well and makes clutters and messes disappear for good.PowerCloud is a power strip equipped with 3 AC outlets, 2 USB-C Power Delivery (PD) ports and 1 USB-A Quick Charge (QC) port.In addition to providing a large amount of power for electrical devices such as computers, TVs, printers and lighting, it also offers blazing-fast, adapter-free, cable-only USB charges to phones, tablets, and laptops.Leading the way is the 65W of USB-C power - the highest of all on the market - able to give your 13” MackBook Pro or MacBook Air a full-speed charge without the need for additional usb power bricks.If you commute daily between your residence and workplace, you can have one PowerCloud at home and one in the office, then you can say goodbye to those heavy, bulky adapters without worrying about your devices running out of power.If you travel a lot, you just need to bring one PowerCloud which fits perfectly in your backpack instead of lugging around several big power adapters to have all of your devices powered up or charged up at maximum speed.PowerCloud not only supports PD3.0 fast charge tech through its dual USB-C ports but also QC3.0 through the USB-A port rated at 18W, able to charge compatible devices up to 4 times faster than a conventional USB power strip. For instance, you can charge your smartphone up to 80% in just 30 minutes.PowerCloud can quickly charge everything you throw at it. In addition to smartphones, tablets and laptops, it also works with Nintendo switch, Kindle, power banks, keyboard, headphones, smart watches, table fan and light.PowerCloud packs three AC outlets in its compact footprint which are widely spaced to accommodate even oversized plugs and power adapters without overlapping.The contact points inside the socket are made with absolute precision at a level of 0.1mm and subjected to rigorous tests to ensure secure grips after thousands of times of use. It won’t become loose or wear out over time to cause heat or sparks, nor too tight to budge the prongs.PowerCloud puts the safety of you and your expensive electronics above all else by employing an all-around 10-fold protection. It offers safeguards against overheat, overcurrent, overvoltage, overcharge, short circuit, overload, undervoltage and electrical shock, fried components, pokes of fingers or other objects. It also comes with a fire-resistant casing of the highest fireproof standard in the industry.Don't work with an office or live with a home tied down by messy wires and tangles of electric cords. Powercloud helps keep your space clutter-free and your mind stress-free for maximum productivity and creativity. The ports on the PowerCloud are strategically arranged in two separate zones: the top zone dedicated to AC outlets and the front zone dedicated to DC usb outputs. The power cables on the front can be routed to the back and hidden from sight. The USB cables on the front are easy to access and quick to plug/unplug. So they won’t end up unruly and bundled up together. And the separation of high- and low-voltage ports eliminates the risk of electric shock and fire hazards.PowerCloud is the best 6-port charging station for multiple devices. It connects up to 6 devices simultaneously, meeting the diverse power needs for work and play of the whole family.Combined with smart IC, PowerCloud automatically detects and adjusts the power for connected devices accordingly and ensures rapid, optimal charging while greatly extending the lifespan of the batteries.PowerCloud packs 65W of USB power, which can either be distributed throughout the three ports or dedicated solely to the USB-C port with a minimum of 45W output even when all the ports are plugged in, giving your laptop or tablet a good amount of juice.PowerCloud sports a minimalist design which will blend in nicely sitting next to your iMac, MacBook or iPhone. It is a departure from blocky, tedious power strips that are meant to hide under desks and behind furniture. You can leave it in plain sight on a desk or table top as a decor which adds functional style to a workspace at home or in the office.There is a LED light which will illuminate green when your devices are being charged, and a master switch to turn on and off all power.Since 2008, Torras has been a brand that never settles for mediocrity and is full of aspirations and dreams. It is committed to providing users with high-quality consumer electronic products.Torras has always adhered to the five principles of ""Lifestyle"", ""Useful"", ""Basic"", ""Simple"" and ""Natural"", advocating the design concept of ""Simple but Unique"".As of April 2020, Torras has registered as many as 224 trademarks in 41 countries around the globe.

<p>Leverpresso is the smallest lever espresso maker that you can use anywhere without electricity.</p>
<p>With Leverpresso, you can achieve maximum pressure with little force. Leverpresso can reach up to 9 bars of pressure, even with its small size. You’ll be able to change the taste of the coffee based on the pressure, amount of water, time of extraction, and all of these aspects can be controlled directly by you!</p>

<p>The typical extraction time for coffee is between 15 to 30 seconds. If you extract between 1-10 seconds, the coffee will tend to taste more sour. If you extract between 10-20 seconds, the coffee will be on the sweeter side. If you extract between 20-30 seconds, the taste will be richer and a bit bitter. You could control these subtle taste differences by utilizing the lever. For example, if you want to reduce the taste of bitterness in your coffee, lower the pressure at the end of the lever-pressing stage.</p>

<p><strong>Our hat is not your typical fitted baseball cap. I have been developing my project for over a year. Working on different prototypes to get better results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My product will revolutionize the fitted cap! The concept of my idea is to have your typical baseball fitted cap which can become many different baseball caps! Each baseball fitted cap comes equipped with a rotatable brim which is also removable. The removable brim can be interchangeable. The consumer can buy several different baseball caps and brims and create their own colors. This is also cost efficient for the buyer where instead of spending 40 to 50 dollars on different fitted hats, they can actually buy different brims to change the look of their fitted baseball cap. The buyer also can choose to get several hats and several brims to really change things up! </strong></p>
<p><strong>We know and are confident that SpinBrim will be the ""New"" fitted baseball cap becoming the next big thing in every city!</strong></p>

CHECK OUT THE VIDEO ABOVE TO OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!
Our hat is not your typical fitted baseball cap. I have been developing my project for over a year. Working on different prototypes to get better results.
My product will revolutionize the fitted cap! The concept of my idea is to have your typical baseball fitted cap which can become many different baseball caps! Each baseball fitted cap comes equipped with a rotatable brim which is also removable. The removable brim can be interchangeable. The consumer can buy several different baseball caps and brims and create their own colors. This is also cost efficient for the buyer where instead of spending 40 to 50 dollars on different fitted hats, they can actually buy different brims to change the look of their fitted baseball cap. The buyer also can choose to get several hats and several brims to really change things up! 
We know and are confident that SpinBrim will be the ""New"" fitted baseball cap becoming the next big thing in every city!

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Josh, and I'm a college student who is interested in computers and music. In my spare time (and there's a good amount of it when I'm not doing homework), I write computer programs. I currently am developing a desktop program called Ninja Cleaner, and I also have a smartphone and web app in the works. Ninja Cleaner is a program that is designed to quickly and easily clean garbage off of your computer. Now, I know that programs that do that already exist, and in abundance, so what sets mine apart? Well, it's lightweight/small, it does its job quickly and quietly, and it does its job well. Kind of like a ninja. Also, I feel like I am gaining experience for the future by writing this program.</p>
<p>The smartphone app is designed to turn long-winded terms-of-service documents for programs into very short, easy-to-read ones. This could potentially increase awareness for the terms of service for apps (because, quite frankly, if it's too long, I'm not going to read it; I have more important things to do). The app is also designed to be easy-to-use and concise; I want the user to feel like they have power, and I don't want them to feel frustrated with that experience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Money Goes Toward</h3>
<p>To bring this project to completion, I need a few things. In Ninja Cleaner, I need a set of controls that have a uniform look and feel that I can use to emphasize the ninja theme, and I will have to upgrade development equipment as necessary.  For the smartphone app, I will need development hardware and software (for example, an upgraded version of Mac OS X for developing, and a Windows Phone for testing), and I will have to pay fees to get the app into the Apple App Store and Google Play. I would also like to get a digital book to help me learn better smartphone-writing practices with the tools I use.</p>
<p>Also, for both projects, I will need money to pay for web domain registering (it would be nice to have a professional-looking website domain!) and possible advertisements. If I hire graphics artists for icons and such, I will need a way to pay them. Plus, I have a little bit of extra money budgeted in case something unexpected comes up, such as paying for web design materials and such.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>No matter what you donate, you will be thanked. I believe that's pretty important. For the donation ""levels"" of $5 and above, I'm offering you haikus (I write song lyrics and/or ""poems"" from time to time), free software, and even a chance to have some influence in my program!</p>
<p>The free software perk(s) are just giving you free access to every program that I independently develop. This includes Ninja Cleaner, as well as future projects, whether they're designed for computers or smartphones.</p>
<p>For donating $100 or more, I'm giving people a chance to help me make major decisions for Ninja Cleaner. God willing, I will send out a monthly email giving those five people a fresh build of Ninja Cleaner, along with some polls to vote on. Those polls would be asking things like whether or not they like a feature that was added in that build, or if they approve or disapprove of future features.</p>
<p>One $200 donor will actually be ""the ninja"" - I'll not only give them monthly beta access, but I will also let them choose what the ninja for the icon of the program will look like. Pretty sweet, eh?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Can't Donate? No Problem!</h3>
</div>
<div>If you can't donate anything, or can only donate a small amount of money, it's OK! I completely understand. But, if you can, there are other ways you can help besides donating money! Here are some things that I need help with:</div>
<div>
<p>- <strong>Spread the word.</strong> The more people that know about this project, the greater the chance that I'll be able to meet my goal.</p>
<p>- <strong>Feedback.</strong> Ninja Cleaner is actually a re-named, re-vamped version of a program I was writing before that was called SpaceSaver. I would appreciate it if you would be willing to give it a try and give me some feedback (tell me what you like/dislike, tell me if there are any bugs, things like that). You can download the (hopefully) final version of that <a href=""http://fongsoft.bugs3.com/download.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Graphic design.</strong> If you're willing to help me by making a logo or an icon, that would be greatly appreciated! You would definitely be mentioned in the credits of the program after that.</p>
<p>- <strong>Language translations.</strong> Just translating my program(s)/app(s) into other languages would make it more accessible to people around the world, and that would be great!</p>
<p>- <strong>Code.</strong> I currently maintain two (God willing, soon to be three) open-source projects, both of which are used in Ninja Cleaner. I would be more than willing to accept your help with these projects, if you’re able. You can find a list of the projects I maintain <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/drummerboy0511"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Grammar suggestions.</strong> In addition to the projects I’ve mentioned in this campaign so far, I’m also working on a browser extension/add-on that replaces “text speak” on websites with correct spelling and punctuation. This is to make it easier to read web-based content. The extension is also being designed to remove profanity from websites. I need your help to compile a list of commonly misspelled words (whether they were done accidentally or on purpose) to use in this extension. You can find a spreadsheet that you can add words to here: <a href=""http://bit.ly/Q3neiE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bit.ly/Q3neiE</a></p>
<p>- <strong>Testing</strong>. My smartphone app, along with other projects, will need some testers. I'd be more than glad to accept help with this, and I'd be more than willing to let you test these apps. You can sign up to test my apps <a href=""http://bit.ly/LLw55c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>

Manage your stress level, improve your working efficiencyHeavy working can help accumulate stress. When your stress is high, you might as well take a break and relax. FitOn enables you to see your stress level and notify you when a break is needed. Keep a high-efficiency rate and wellness level at the same time with FitOn. Read More on Workplace Stress.The integrated short-term Heart-Rate-Variability feature and the RSA (determination of respiratory sinus arrhythmia) feature enables FitOn to detect your momentary stress levels, assess your health and risk situation, and helps you get a better understanding of internal stress triggers and nervous system responses.Sleep quality is important because we spend ⅓ of life in bed. A good quality night's sleep will make your day more enjoyable. To avoid any nights that lead to exhausted day at work, FitOn steps into play. It supports the following features and functionalities:Sleep Insights Get insights on your night. See valuable insights about your sleep to get a clearer picture of your nighttime habits, how your routine might be affecting your sleep quality and what you can do to improve.  •Automatic Sleep Detection •Sleep Onset Latency – the time it takes you to fall asleep •Specific period of time you were awake during sleep •Light Sleep •Deep Sleep  •Best time to wake you up to maximize your productivity •Total Sleep TimeWith the comprehensive analysis of your sleeping cycle, a quality night's sleep won’t be a wild wish anymore.We understand monitoring is not enough, and insight matters. That is why our software team is constantly improving our data accuracy and aspiring to develop advanced algorithms in vital sign analysis to help sense any potential sickness early.1. HRV Testing  (Available on FitOn Wellness Pro)What is HRV? Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. A higher HRV value typically means you are healthier and in better aerobic shape. As shown in the graph to the left, two adults with the same heart rate of 60, the HRV value of user B is higher than that of user A, meaning that user B is healthier. By analyzing the differences when the heart beats each time and having timely access to health information, HRV can be used for stress recovery. Studies have shown that heart rate variability can detect coronary heart disease, hypertension, and heart failure. In particular, the prognosis of cardiovascular disease will continue and should be monitored. Controlling the changes in the heart may prevent the recurrence of deterioration.As shown in the picture to the top, by collecting the PP interval in the PPG graph (or the RR interval in the ECG/EKG graph or the JJ interval data in the BCG graph), the Lorenz plot is obtained. FitOn can roughly judge whether a person has a sinus heart rate or supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias from the Lorenz plot analysis.primitive build of both algorithm and presentation2nd version user interface designHRV 1.02. Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) Not many people aware of Oxygen Saturation's use in everyday life. But, do you know that periodic measurement of your SpO2 (especially during sleep) could benefit in early prevention of suffocation, choking, infections, (such as pneumonia) drowning diseases, (such as emphysema), lung cancer, and lung infections. Inhaling poisonous chemicals, heart failure, or a history of heart attacks allergic reactions general anesthesia sleep apnea.For those working in closed environments, such as miners and divers, or for those who might suffer from Hypoxia, like the mountain climbers, it's definitely necessary to have oxygen saturation monitored to stay safe.Above graphs show the abnormal sleeping status from a sick tester.3. Vital Signs Notification Receiving reminders and notifications once the reading is over the default preset. This is to avoid any potential accidents and better control your energy output during vigorous exercise.4.

Risks and challengesFitOn is a brand-new product. In order to let more people know about it and be able enjoy it, we launched it on Indiegogo. And you will be the first to receive it!Just like any other project, we may face challenges when it comes to engineering, manufacturing, and shipping. But what we have is not just passion, we also have rich experience in developing products. Here are some challenges we may encounter and some ways we can solve them:1) Certification: FitOn must be tested and approved by various independent agencies. We've gotten a head start on the process of FCC and CE certification. We’ll optimize our products in compliance with the certification and will complete it ASAP.2) Production: FitOn is a sophisticated product, which demands a lot in the process of production. In order for customer to receive it before Christmas, we’re carrying out production tests right now, ensuring there will be no issues in the process of production. We have already contacted the manufacturer of the PCB and case, and purchased some material for production.We’re fully aware that unexpected bumps in the road may arise and our team is dedicated to doing whatever it takes to keep our promises. We will keep updating our progress to you. Also, we’re glad to hear feedback from our backers. Together, let’s make FitOn possible",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

US, EU + 8 and Canada are the 30 countries we can ship never cracked 512 bit AES to (now listed on enclosed voviemeetingtoyou power point) running over VOVIE's private secure network. BIS says our type of symmetric ciphers are 8 times stronger than asymmetric ciphers, so 64 bit AES is their current compliant maximum for mass, rest of world distribution without a license. (Except Iran, Cuba, Syria, Sudan and N. Korea get none) We also have US HIPPA secure medical records encryption compliance at AES 256 bit to help people everywhere get faster treatment and our 64-bit meets US Banking Financial Rules for Security.

<p><i> No one has access except you and the individual you selected to communicate with  and push button Burn Message/No record at all option is available to each if desired. VOVIE clients only communicate between other SELECTED VOVIE users, directly peer to peer (P2P), client to client. All user data is encrypted by VOVIE inside your own personal device and transported best route at time of call directly between you-your selected associate’s device on VOVIE's private cloud network, for decode. VOVIE automatically controls all media flow's inside your smart device and across the cloud networks. Skype, Cisco, Apple and others use multiple ported clients with Intermediate Server Access, some even browsers with many open or unsecured ports, making them vulnerable to security threats. We use none of this. VOVIE is a safer and faster single super port Native Code designed specifically for navigating world wide web real time big media traffic today; No backdoor access exists for Edward Snowden's; Prism, Tempora, Upstream, Boundless Informant or other spy programs.  </i></p>
<p><b><i>What Does Low Bandwidth Live Communications Mean? </i></b></p>
<p><i>2 Way, communications require upload line speed to send both users live video/voice to each other in real time. 98% of global user connections now can sustain 400 kbps or less of upload line speed and 90% 150 kbps or less. To reduce your loading VOVIE only sends new video pixels once (not the over and over again video frames of others) and non destructively compresses 1080p video up to 2500:1 (others up to 270:1) then manages your media and all networking packets between your devices. Net result is video conferencing bits/packets required by us is often 10% of the line speed bit rates required by existing suppliers. Check out our power point enclosed for more details. Everyone on low cost lines and pay by bit mobile plans will really like VOVIE's affordability and performance. </i></p>
<p><i><b>Will you provide an API and/or allow third party clients? </b></i></p>
<p><i>Yes, after we deliver to You! Private High Resolution Robust Networks are the future for consumers, businesses, medical, education, media/entertainment, auto electronics &amp; many others. VOVIE is small, lite, fast, easily embedded code for control and communications applications with simple sign-in, load and go from URL's anywhere, like FaceBook, Linkedin &amp; others.   </i></p>
<p><i><b>Open Source?</b> </i></p>
<p><i> Not Now. Open source guarantees no security yet open source encryption requires early code reviews by governments prior to export/import when trade secrets do not. (Open source program, Boundless Informant, is used to spy on millions now.) Our custom transport control connectivity in-sync signal layer, secure authentication &amp; infrastructure with no outside access (even us) will remain our trade secrets for now. </i></p>

Others use codes, protocols, were received free from NSA, DOD & others prior efforts that do not match the exact intent demanded by real time heavy media products today. Most are built for intermediate handling of data flows through their own servers or even other clients computers. These intermediate accesses cause additional latency, wait states and big heavy data loads congesting their own lines at key locations on the network its self, increasing lost data/packets, destroying continuity, quality and security. VOVIE inter-operates with Skype/Web-Ex & others (In our own supercharged window, while securely accelerating your personal network and reducing the network loading that occurs when communicating live). VOVIE's user value is wait-state-less, highest definition collaboration & chats encrypted over affordable connections. Below shows VOVIE size video chat resolution (big pic) vs others (little box) over a 400 kbps up-speed DSL line.

Later we will support education, medical & others if successful here. 
Is it really secure? 
 VOVIE launches with Top Rated, RSA AES cipher up to 512 bit keyed Encryption (never cracked) running over our VOVIE Custom Secure Private Real Time Network Transport Protocol. The dual strength of our private custom transport, net/data control, connectivity network & AES Ciphers enable very secure communications with no back door access for NSA Prism, Tempora, Upstream, Boundless Informant or other spy programs announced by Edward Snowden. Our layers of private network & AES by packet encryption are strong security with all levels, meeting US financial banking rules for security at minimum. We make secure access to your device our top option. If outsiders have your device or remote control of it, your VOVIE Messages Are Still Secure, unlike other apps you may have installed. (US Military/Weapons and NSA use RSA AES Encryption) 
 Who are you targeting? 
 Every Connected Internet user who wants the freedom of speech and safe, affordable high resolution communications everywhere: VOVIE team, Indiegogo supporters, family, friends and associates are the beginning, with 2 Billion current Windows PC internet users awaiting.

Why are you doing this? 
We Believe, Safe HD LIVE WORLD Collaboration FOR ALL is every persons right and is our personal communications holy grail. We hope, you decide to help us with this. 
What will the money be used for? 
We need $300,000 to fund 4 man years of full-time work and some part time efforts by our very experienced team members, to do this right. We will engineer your user interface so everyone can easily/instantly/securely connect with anyone they want. We will launch our automatic registration and authentication server for global scale deployment to enable up to 100 million call connections per day per server by Dec 2013 when we launch secure voice/music/text chat. We will test/test all engines and features together to launch HD video by April 2014. Final Versions of all perks are scheduled for Summer 2014. Your donations will launch affordable, secure, high definition collaboration for everyone. 
What if you raise over $300,000?
We will spend it wisely (: developing more features and adding other devices too. Let us know if you would like: Drag and drop Instant Photo & Microsoft Word/PP/Excel Doc Share, Video or Voice Chats for many people at a time, Remote Encrypted Cloud Storage, Real Time Live Broadcast to thousands for each of you or other functions. If we get enough money we can put engineers on Android and Apple and solve universal global real time secure connectivity. A blog will be set up for this and a sight for fast bug resolution too. 
 Does VOVIE save messages on a server? 

No. None. Never! All VOVIE Communications can only be stored inside selected callers/users devices. If you select; Auto Burn Message No Copy Button, all data is automatically wiped clean instantly after viewing, speaking or reading text. 
How will registration keys and pre-register usernames work?
Prior to release Donors will get an email with instructions to our registration server and how to register yourselves and/or assignees. Note: we do not send this email directly after your payment. 
Can I invest in VOVIE? 
Indiegogo nor US Security laws permit us to use this venue to sell equity to the public. Qualified sophisticated investors can contact us after the indiegogo program has ended. 
Do You Have Multiple Levels of Security? 
Yes. We are encryption export compliant with the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). US, EU + 8 and Canada are the 30 countries we can ship never cracked 512 bit AES to (now listed on enclosed voviemeetingtoyou power point) running over VOVIE's private secure network. BIS says our type of symmetric ciphers are 8 times stronger than asymmetric ciphers, so 64 bit AES is their current compliant maximum for mass, rest of world distribution without a license. (Except Iran, Cuba, Syria, Sudan and N. Korea get none) We also have US HIPPA secure medical records encryption compliance at AES 256 bit to help people everywhere get faster treatment and our 64-bit meets US Banking Financial Rules for Security. All of these are very secure with no outside system access, by even us, as it runs over it's our own private network layer. 
Countries Authorized for 512-bit (never cracked) AES

 EU in BLUE: Austria, Belgium,  Bulgaria,
 Canada, Croatia  Cyprus, Czech
Republic, Denmark,  Estonia,  Finland, 
France,  Germany,   Greece  Hungary,  Ireland,  Italy,  Latvia, Lithuania,
Luxembourg,  Malta, Netherlands
 Poland,  Portugal,
Romania,
Slovakia, Slovenia,  Spain, 
Sweden,
United
Kingdom, US

Does my company or others have Access to my data? 
 No one has access except you and the individual you selected to communicate with  and push button Burn Message/No record at all option is available to each if desired. VOVIE clients only communicate between other SELECTED VOVIE users, directly peer to peer (P2P), client to client. All user data is encrypted by VOVIE inside your own personal device and transported best route at time of call directly between you-your selected associate’s device on VOVIE's private cloud network, for decode. VOVIE automatically controls all media flow's inside your smart device and across the cloud networks. Skype, Cisco, Apple and others use multiple ported clients with Intermediate Server Access, some even browsers with many open or unsecured ports, making them vulnerable to security threats. We use none of this. VOVIE is a safer and faster single super port Native Code designed specifically for navigating world wide web real time big media traffic today; No backdoor access exists for Edward Snowden's; Prism, Tempora, Upstream, Boundless Informant or other spy programs.  
What Does Low Bandwidth Live Communications Mean? 
2 Way, communications require upload line speed to send both users live video/voice to each other in real time. 98% of global user connections now can sustain 400 kbps or less of upload line speed and 90% 150 kbps or less. To reduce your loading VOVIE only sends new video pixels once (not the over and over again video frames of others) and non destructively compresses 1080p video up to 2500:1 (others up to 270:1) then manages your media and all networking packets between your devices. Net result is video conferencing bits/packets required by us is often 10% of the line speed bit rates required by existing suppliers. Check out our power point enclosed for more details. Everyone on low cost lines and pay by bit mobile plans will really like VOVIE's affordability and performance. 
Will you provide an API and/or allow third party clients? 
Yes, after we deliver to You! Private High Resolution Robust Networks are the future for consumers, businesses, medical, education, media/entertainment, auto electronics & many others. VOVIE is small, lite, fast, easily embedded code for control and communications applications with simple sign-in, load and go from URL's anywhere, like FaceBook, Linkedin & others.   
Open Source? 
 Not Now. Open source guarantees no security yet open source encryption requires early code reviews by governments prior to export/import when trade secrets do not. (Open source program, Boundless Informant, is used to spy on millions now.) Our custom transport control connectivity in-sync signal layer, secure authentication & infrastructure with no outside access (even us) will remain our trade secrets for now. 
 Can I e-mail you? 
 Yes, CEO (at) meetingtoyou.com. (Heavy email response may take additional time). Additional information and bandwidth requirements can be found @meetingtoyou.com
Please help make this happen for everyone who wants safe high definition communications with anyone in the world. Thank you very much for your support.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>THE EUREKA MOMENT</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Have you ever tossed and turned at night because your room was too hot or cold? Well we sure have! Sometimes we’d gaze up at the air vents in our ceiling, the main culprit of our discomfort, wishing we could easily open/close them with our smartphones. Why wasn’t there a product that could help us?</span></p>
<p>                                                                </p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">The average American household spends half of its total energy bill on heating and cooling costs. This same home also has 2–4 rooms overheated or over cooled (“over-conditioned”) at any time. This is not only uncomfortable but also terribly energy inefficient. Manually opening and closing various vents is inconvenient and labor intensive.</span></p>
<p> <img alt=""2-4 rooms overheat/overcooled"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/780165/pictures/full/20130427200027-Home_2-4_rooms_overheated_or_overcooled.png?1367118032"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR PRODUCT</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">To solve these issues, we developed the Keen Vent. The Keen Vent is a wirelessly networked home air vent that maximizes the efficiency and comfort of a home’s heating and cooling system by intelligently redirecting central HVAC airflow.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Keen Vent image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/780943/pictures/full/20130428121149-Keen_Vent_product_image_small.jpg?1367176312"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Keen Vents are primarily installed in over-conditioned rooms and automatically open and close in response to specific details of a user’s home and lifestyle—effectively reducing a home’s square footage that needs to be conditioned at that time. The average single family home will need a Keen Vent System (made up of 4 Keen Vents) to optimize their existing HVAC system.</span></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 11px;""><em>Our tests in homes across the country show that the Keen Vent System shortens the run time of central HVAC systems by up to 30%.</em></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;""><em><strong>With these efficiency gains, the Keen Vent System pays for itself in the first year of operation.</strong></em><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Anyone with a home Internet connection and a central heating or cooling system can benefit from the Keen Vent, which will be <strong>sold in four standard sizes: 4”x10”, 4”x12”, 6”x10”, and 6”x12”</strong>. The vent will be made from paintable polycarbonate composite that is attractive and high quality.</span></p>
<p><strong>All Keen Vents purchased via this pre-order campaign will have LIFETIME software service plans.  There will be no additional fees.</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Keen Vents are easily user-installed:</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">To avoid damage to the HVAC fan, only </span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">one third of all vents</span></span><span style=""font-size: 11px;""> in a home should be Keen Vents. In addition to networked vents, we will also sell non-networked faceplates to allow customers to coordinate all vents in their home. These will be user-installed the same way as networked Keen Vents.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Vent usage information is measured and maintained in the cloud, allowing our proprietary Keen Home software to use customer data to adjust vent schedules according to changing temperatures both inside and outside a user’s home.</span></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 11px;""> </strong></p>
<p><strong>STATUS OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">The Keen Vent was born in November 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">We have already completed multiple design iterations in order to develop our demo prototype, which is pictured above.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">A successful campaign will allow us to complete our product development and produce a unit for beta testing. Production-ready units are expected to ship to U.S. customers in Q3 2014 and Canadian customers by Q4 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">U.S. shipping and handling for all Keen Vent perks will be $10.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Canadian shipping and handling for all Keen Vent perks will be $25.</span></p>

<p><strong>WE NEED YOU</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11px;"">Keen Home’s vision is to bring home automation to the masses in a way that is simple to install and easy to use. We aim to provide products and services that benefit both the customer and the environment.</span></p>

""One of the best features of this system is easy installation""

THE EUREKA MOMENT
Have you ever tossed and turned at night because your room was too hot or cold? Well we sure have! Sometimes we’d gaze up at the air vents in our ceiling, the main culprit of our discomfort, wishing we could easily open/close them with our smartphones. Why wasn’t there a product that could help us?
                                                                
THE PROBLEM
The average American household spends half of its total energy bill on heating and cooling costs. This same home also has 2–4 rooms overheated or over cooled (“over-conditioned”) at any time. This is not only uncomfortable but also terribly energy inefficient. Manually opening and closing various vents is inconvenient and labor intensive.
 
 
OUR PRODUCT
To solve these issues, we developed the Keen Vent. The Keen Vent is a wirelessly networked home air vent that maximizes the efficiency and comfort of a home’s heating and cooling system by intelligently redirecting central HVAC airflow.
 
Keen Vents are primarily installed in over-conditioned rooms and automatically open and close in response to specific details of a user’s home and lifestyle—effectively reducing a home’s square footage that needs to be conditioned at that time. The average single family home will need a Keen Vent System (made up of 4 Keen Vents) to optimize their existing HVAC system.
Our tests in homes across the country show that the Keen Vent System shortens the run time of central HVAC systems by up to 30%.
With these efficiency gains, the Keen Vent System pays for itself in the first year of operation.
Anyone with a home Internet connection and a central heating or cooling system can benefit from the Keen Vent, which will be sold in four standard sizes: 4”x10”, 4”x12”, 6”x10”, and 6”x12”. The vent will be made from paintable polycarbonate composite that is attractive and high quality.
All Keen Vents purchased via this pre-order campaign will have LIFETIME software service plans.  There will be no additional fees.
Keen Vents are easily user-installed:

To avoid damage to the HVAC fan, only one third of all vents in a home should be Keen Vents. In addition to networked vents, we will also sell non-networked faceplates to allow customers to coordinate all vents in their home. These will be user-installed the same way as networked Keen Vents.
Vent usage information is measured and maintained in the cloud, allowing our proprietary Keen Home software to use customer data to adjust vent schedules according to changing temperatures both inside and outside a user’s home.
 
STATUS OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
The Keen Vent was born in November 2012.
We have already completed multiple design iterations in order to develop our demo prototype, which is pictured above.
A successful campaign will allow us to complete our product development and produce a unit for beta testing. Production-ready units are expected to ship to U.S. customers in Q3 2014 and Canadian customers by Q4 2014.
U.S. shipping and handling for all Keen Vent perks will be $10.
Canadian shipping and handling for all Keen Vent perks will be $25.
 
WE NEED YOU
Keen Home’s vision is to bring home automation to the masses in a way that is simple to install and easy to use. We aim to provide products and services that benefit both the customer and the environment.
So here’s how you can help us accomplish our goal:


Contribute. Whether you donate $5 or $500, every dollar you spend goes toward achieving our vision above and that starts with completing development of the Keen Vent.


Promote. Like us on Facebook.  Follow us on Twitter and tweet about us to your followers. Email friends and family who may be interested.


Benefit. Enjoy the increased comfort and energy efficiency your Keen Vent System provides!


 
USE OF FUNDS
The proceeds from our campaign will help us with the following 3 initiatives:
1)     Complete product development
2)     Reduce manufacturing costs
3)     Make the Keen Vent System accessible to everyone
Every single Keen Vent system ordered through the Indiegogo campaign will receive our software services for the life of the product.

<h3>What is GreenEase?</h3>
<p>How many times have you tried to find a restaurant that sources its products locally and seasonally? Have you tried to look for a vegan restaurant and wish you could have downloaded the menu <strong>before</strong> you walked in? Do you wish that you could make more of an impact in the local community in which you live?</p>
<p>A large number of you desire to eat more sustainably - and we're not just talking about counting carbon emissions or miles your food travels to you, but knowing that the food your restaurant is serving is organic, local, free-range, and/or hormone-free.   </p>
<p>Did you know that in MD, VA, PA and WV alone we have thousands of farms? It’s true!</p>
<p>DC is fortunate to have a number of amazing local farmers in its own backyard and this is where GreenEase makes it easier for you, the local food enthusiast, to find restaurants, cafes and bakeries that support our local farmers and serve delicious and sustainable food options. We'll work directly with the farms and distributors to find out what food venues they source to, and bring that information to your smart phone. </p>
<p>GPS tracking can tell you how far a restaurant or café is. Menu features can show you exactly what’s on that menu so you can make a more informed decision. The GreenEase app even tells you what restaurants are vegan, vegetarian, range-free, organic, or gluten-free!</p>
<p>Join us today! Your contribution gets you the paid version of the app for FREE along with some other special deals!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The website will be launching in February 2013, but we need your help in raising money to make this into a subsequent mobile app - something we know people will use on the go. The costs range from $4,000-$10,000, but since the founders are putting up a lot of their own hard-earned cash, we wanted to use IndieGoGo to get the word out <em><strong>and</strong></em> help us raise that little bit to move us into the app version of the product.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates will get the paid version of the Greenease app for <strong>free</strong>. This gives you access to menus, special deals and coupons, and rank boosts in your own reviews and ratings. Additional perks are tote bags, invitations to the launch party and advertisement on the site!</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Websites like Yelp help you find any business or restaurant that's out there, but for those of us who prefer fresh and seasonal cuisine, want to make an impact in our local economies and have particular diets (vegans, I'm looking at you) this is the right search engine for the best meal out there. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're unable to donate, we understand. Feel free to share this IndieGoGo project with your friends, colleagues, and local restaurants. We want everyone out there to know the importance of supporting our local living communities, and that starts with you!</p>

<p><b>Update #1: Change in button construction.</b></p>
<p>Through continuous testing of our prototype, we have concluded that it is in the best interest of our backers and future users if we use a mechanical button on Rayo instead of a touch control. A touch control system provides a seamless and minimal interface, but it lacks the robustness when operated in the harsh conditions in which Rayo may be exposed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a mechanical button operates more robustly and is more intuitive. One thing that is of concern is the design of the physical button. Our product designers will do everything to keep Rayo looking great as it is supposed to be. Check update section for the up-to-date image of Rayo!</p>
<p><strong>Update #2: Aero </strong><strong>seatpost</strong><strong> compatibility</strong></p>
<p>Rayo will come with a standard-seatpost-compatible silicon back that is interchangeable with an aero seatpost adaptor. We will provide the additional aero seatpost adaptor (plus a longer strap) for backers who need them, free of charge. We will ask whether you want the aero seatpost adaptor while surveying for color options after the end of the campaign.</p>

<p><b>Balanced Visibility</b></p>
<p>Generic tail-lights only use a single LED light with visibility from the rear but diminished visibility on the sides. Rayo has <b>three LED lights</b>, each with a different purpose. One illuminates the sides while the other two form a tighter beam to be seen better from the rear. Such a system ultimately achieves balanced visibility from the rear and both sides.</p>
<div data-id=""19468359""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Rayo achieves balanced visibility from the rear and sides"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/019/468/359/e389b4350a2fe0c43d4f4c23a8b9457d_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1512239811&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=ff7e8b3c6ab3c1971bdde709886ab50d"" src=""""/><figcaption>Rayo achieves balanced visibility from the rear and sides</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><b>Easily Configurable</b></p>
<p>Most tail-lights have preconfigured flashing modes, and you are stuck with them, forever. Some modes never get used, and the lights may not have the exact pattern you would like. Rayo lets you fully customize the flashing patterns according to your riding conditions. Once configured, you can select the flashing pattern you need, with just a tap at the touch control.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>

<div><p>We currently have a functional prototype of Rayo that is ready for mass production. However, we are aware that there may be necessary changes to meet manufacturing requirements. Our policy is to make sure that our backers are continuously informed of any updates or changes. We plan to keep our campaign as transparent as possible, and we also promise to do our best to overcome any challenges we encounter on the way. We are looking forward to the day we deliver Rayo to the hands of our cycling-loving backers. Until then, ride safe!</p></div></section></div>","About


Update #1: Change in button construction.
Through continuous testing of our prototype, we have concluded that it is in the best interest of our backers and future users if we use a mechanical button on Rayo instead of a touch control. A touch control system provides a seamless and minimal interface, but it lacks the robustness when operated in the harsh conditions in which Rayo may be exposed.
On the other hand, a mechanical button operates more robustly and is more intuitive. One thing that is of concern is the design of the physical button. Our product designers will do everything to keep Rayo looking great as it is supposed to be. Check update section for the up-to-date image of Rayo!
Update #2: Aero seatpost compatibility
Rayo will come with a standard-seatpost-compatible silicon back that is interchangeable with an aero seatpost adaptor. We will provide the additional aero seatpost adaptor (plus a longer strap) for backers who need them, free of charge. We will ask whether you want the aero seatpost adaptor while surveying for color options after the end of the campaign.
What Do The Experts Think

 
Nick Drombosky is the founder of Banker Supply, a bike store located in Echo Park, LA.
Chris Reynolds is the Director and Publisher of Bicyclist: SoCal & Beyond: a social enterprise promoting bicycle riding for sport, activity, and transportation.
 

Rayo is a bicycle tail-light designed for the modern cyclist. Equipped with ultra-bright LEDs, engineered optics, motion detection, and bluetooth connectivity features, Rayo’s functionalities not only boost your riding safety, but also make your riding experience more convenient, entertaining, and seamless.

 

 

 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 
We will provide an additional aero seatpost adaptor (plus a longer strap) for backers who need them, free of charge. We will ask whether you want the aero seatpost adaptor while surveying for color options after the end of the campaign.


Rayo comes in five appealing and unique colors to make you and your bike look better than ever. You love your bike. Give it what it deserves.

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

Rayo uses specifically designed total internal reflection (TIR) lenses to direct and focus light emitted by LEDs. The combination of three LEDs and two TIR lenses with different specifications enhances visibility from both the rear and the sides.

 

Upon braking, Rayo will detect that you are slowing down and will automatically trigger a brake light, warning traffic behind you. At the core of this feature is an algorithm that accurately tracks the movement of the bike, similar to what is integrated into modern drones.

 

The blinking patterns of each LED light in Rayo are user-configurable, allowing you to create the best signaling options depending on your riding style, traffic, and weather conditions. Future updates will include additional flashing patterns.

 

At a maximum of 90 lumens with specialized optics, Rayo is also daylight visible. Catch the attention of vehicles, other riders, and pedestrians, no matter what time of day it is.

 

Rayo's one-of-a-kind feature is group LED synchronization. Rayo can synchronize flashing patterns with nearby Rayo lights, making you and fellow riders stand out as a group. Synchronization takes effect without the hassle of manually pairing devices.

 

Rayo offers a theft alert feature that notifies you through the Rayo mobile app when unfamiliar movement is detected on your bike. Now, take that break without worrying about whether or not your bike is being tampered with.

 

Rayo's mobile app allows you to configure Rayo's many features intuitively. Using Bluetooth Low Energy, connecting Rayo to your smartphone is fast and simple.

 

All of Rayo’s features come sealed within an IP67 waterproof body.  A built-in USB port makes Rayo rechargeable at home, in the office, and from external power banks.

 
 


Balanced Visibility
Generic tail-lights only use a single LED light with visibility from the rear but diminished visibility on the sides. Rayo has three LED lights, each with a different purpose. One illuminates the sides while the other two form a tighter beam to be seen better from the rear. Such a system ultimately achieves balanced visibility from the rear and both sides.
Rayo achieves balanced visibility from the rear and sides
Easily Configurable
Most tail-lights have preconfigured flashing modes, and you are stuck with them, forever. Some modes never get used, and the lights may not have the exact pattern you would like. Rayo lets you fully customize the flashing patterns according to your riding conditions. Once configured, you can select the flashing pattern you need, with just a tap at the touch control.
Rayo allows you to customize flashing patterns for your needs
 

If you have ever shopped for a bicycle tail-light and was disappointed finding that most of them look rather out-of-date, Rayo is just for you. Rayo's award-winning design offers a minimalistic and sleek look and with five distinct colors to match your style.

</ul><h2>FAQ</h2><ol>
<li>Can Cubiio engrave metal, anodized aluminum, glass, mirror, concrete, stone, ceramics or pottery?<br/><strong>Ans:</strong> No. Technically, due to wavelength and laser power, Cubiio cannot work on these materials.<br/>WARNING! Metal, glass, mirror, and any smooth surfaces may reflect laser and harm people. Use CubiioShield to enclose laser inside. Wear goggles to protect yourself.<br/> </li>
<li>Can Cubiio engrave plastic?<br/><strong>Ans:</strong> It depends. There are so many kinds of ""plastic"" and it is impossible to test them all. As we tested so far, Cubiio can engrave on non-transparent acrylic, rubber, and can cut black vinyl paper. However, transparent or white materials are not recommended.<br/>WARNING! Burning plastic may produce toxic fumes and harm people.<br/> </li>
<li>Wavelength and lifetime of the laser? Can laser source be changed?<br/><strong>Ans:</strong> 450 nm and 10000 hours. No, Cubiio's laser source can NOT be changed.<p>See our video and picture, engraving one macaron needs 32 seconds. 10000 hours lifetime mean that you can engrave 1 MILLION pieces.<br/> </p>
</li>
<li><p>What is  the interlock mechanism between cubiio and the shield?<br/><strong>Ans:</strong> An electromagnetic coil is installed at the interface between cubiio and the shield. When the shield is enclosed by the metal base, a sensor is triggered to activate the coil. The coil generates magnetic field and then affects the hall sensor in the cubiio. Now the CPU knows the shield is present and then allows the laser to work.<br/>Where does the electromagnetic locate?<br/>You can see it obviously at the interface between cubiio and the shield after you receive the package.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a way to use cubiio without the shield for users in countries without laser regulations?<br/><strong>Ans:</strong> Yes, there is. A disclaimer can be found in the control app. If you agree with the conditions of the disclaimer, sign it in app, and then the app will allow you to use cubiio without the shield. Here is the draft of the disclaimer: <a href=""http://cubiio.muherz.com/sm/disclaimer.txt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://cubiio.muherz.com/sm/disclaimer.txt</a></p></li>

If you don't have the possibility to do that you will need CubiioShield. If you plan to enjoy the fun of Cubiio with juveniles, you need CubiioShield as well. There’s also a built-in USB socket to power your Cubiio unit. Cubiio and CubiioShield are undergoing the laser certification process of IEC60825-1 and FDA CDRH. We will announce the result once the certification is obtained.

Details of Laser Module:
  Technology Inside CubiioCubiio consists of a semiconductor laser source and two current-driven mirrors in order to deflect the laser beam along X and Y axes. The embedded CPU translate your sketches into digital commands to tilt mirrors particularly. Then the focused laser spot will be projected to the target surface along the designed trajectory. Aforementioned mechanism is so-called “galvanometer,” which can be further studied in Wikipedia.Only ""galvanometer""? Nothing else? Good question! There is ""something"" else! Traditional galvanometer laser machines correct image distortion problem by using ""f-theta lens,"" which is very bulky and expensive. We have specially developed an algorithm to compensate distortion successfully. Therefore, we can make Cubiio portable and affordable. The patent of virtual lens algorithm is pending.Rewards5 Colors: Physical Prototype Photograph

Nowadays, 3D printers are affordable and every maker owns one. Our dream is to make this magic happen to laser engravers as well. After hard working for one year, the world’s most compact laser engraver has born.Cubiio is an aluminum-alloy cube smaller than a baseball and lighter than an iPhone 7 Plus. We have not only shrunk the size but also the price. Cubiio is absolutely easy-to-use, portable, and affordable. Every maker, baker, designer, and handcrafter can own his/her personal laser machine now. We appreciate your support and hope to share our achievements with you.

FAQ
Can Cubiio engrave metal, anodized aluminum, glass, mirror, concrete, stone, ceramics or pottery?Ans: No. Technically, due to wavelength and laser power, Cubiio cannot work on these materials.WARNING! Metal, glass, mirror, and any smooth surfaces may reflect laser and harm people. Use CubiioShield to enclose laser inside. Wear goggles to protect yourself. 
Can Cubiio engrave plastic?Ans: It depends. There are so many kinds of ""plastic"" and it is impossible to test them all. As we tested so far, Cubiio can engrave on non-transparent acrylic, rubber, and can cut black vinyl paper. However, transparent or white materials are not recommended.WARNING! Burning plastic may produce toxic fumes and harm people. 
Wavelength and lifetime of the laser? Can laser source be changed?Ans: 450 nm and 10000 hours. No, Cubiio's laser source can NOT be changed.See our video and picture, engraving one macaron needs 32 seconds. 10000 hours lifetime mean that you can engrave 1 MILLION pieces. 

What is  the interlock mechanism between cubiio and the shield?Ans: An electromagnetic coil is installed at the interface between cubiio and the shield. When the shield is enclosed by the metal base, a sensor is triggered to activate the coil. The coil generates magnetic field and then affects the hall sensor in the cubiio. Now the CPU knows the shield is present and then allows the laser to work.Where does the electromagnetic locate?You can see it obviously at the interface between cubiio and the shield after you receive the package.
Is there a way to use cubiio without the shield for users in countries without laser regulations?Ans: Yes, there is. A disclaimer can be found in the control app. If you agree with the conditions of the disclaimer, sign it in app, and then the app will allow you to use cubiio without the shield. Here is the draft of the disclaimer: http://cubiio.muherz.com/sm/disclaimer.txt",18.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The first design concept was based on the use of wire cables to control the locking and unlocking of the two swivel balls at each end of the telescopic arm. The locking of the telescoping feature also utilized the action of the cable controls. After 12-months of design, prototyping and testing we were stuck.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507880047/uy1tlea8nhckhj3gsl74.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It was then that Matt proposed a new approach that seemed more direct and simple in achieving the simultaneous locking of the two ball joints. An encouraging prototype paved the way for refinements that led to today's Zen Mount that applies the rotary motion of an internal shaft to a linear motion that creates high forces against a steel ball joint to prevent movement. </p>
<p>The performance and durability of the Zen Mount products was enhanced with use of high quality engineered molded resin, stainless steel where exceptional strength is needed and high grade aluminum where strength and weight are a factor. </p>
<p>All the components were designed on Solidworks 3D CAD system that is compatible with the manufacturing processes to eliminate any errors between design intent and the final product. </p>
<p>Our selection of vendors was based on capabilities to produce Zen Mount parts at specific dimensional tolerances needed for function. All metal parts are made by CNC machining or extrusions.

A. JustMake allows you to show your projects to a selected audience, for instance a big company or a private business, by marking them with hashtags and appropriately directing your request. This way, you will get a highly customized and fruitful advertisement for your work.
Q. Does JustMake provide any kind of protection to my works?
A. We are finalizing a DRM model that will guarantee any professional the right of keeping selling out their products, regardless of any illegal behaviour from the users.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>We have collaborated with Sketchfab - the world’s largest platform to publish, share and discover 3D content online and in AR. Thanks to Sketchfab’s AR technology, you can use your smartphone to move around any object you created with the Wand - just like you would in real life. There are no limitations!</p>
<p><b>How does it work?</b></p>
<p>Simply tap the Sketchfab icon to place the model in your desired spot. You can then zoom in and out by pinching the screen and you can tilt the screen to rotate your design. Most importantly, you can walk freely around the model while it remains locked to its original location.</p>
<p>Just have fun!</p>

My name is Katherine Hiraldo and I am the owner of a small business (3times3greek) which serves the greek-lettered community.  I began the business in July of 2010 and have been providing affordable merchandise to a couple of sororities, but am aiming to branch out to provide items to other organizations.  My goal is to eventually provide top quality, affordable, and ‘eco-friendly’ (“green”) merchandise to as many sororities and fraternities as possible.  All of the items will be original and with an artistic perspective.
I’ve been working since I was 14 years old in a variety of fields, but I never found my niche.  I’ve always known I wanted to own a business but I just didn’t know what in.  Thankfully opportunity knocked for this business endeavor and I answered the door.  Creativity and inspiration rained down on me like a monsoon and the journey has been nonstop since.  It’s so easy to give up on a dream because the dreams that are worth fighting for are the hardest to obtain.  The best dreams are also the ones that you feel in your heart you can’t give up on, no matter what.  People will put you through a gauntlet, telling you your dream is impossible to achieve, or you’re crazy for even considering working for it.  People will tell you your idea is dumb or won’t help you succeed in life, and you get worn down from fighting them.  Thankfully every time I’ve felt like there was no hope left, there has always been a light shining ahead to keep me pushing forward.  If you’ve ever given up on a dream, let this dream of mine be OUR dream.  If you don’t have something to fight for, help me fight for this to happen.  I am determined to make this dream become reality.
 
Dreams
By Langston HughesHold fast to dreamsFor if dreams dieLife is a broken-winged birdThat cannot fly.Hold fast to dreamsFor when dreams goLife is a barren fieldFrozen with snow.   
 
 
The Impact:
Many companies which already sell items to fraternities and sororities do not provide “eco-friendly” merchandise.  Also many of the people buying these items are undergraduate students who cannot afford to spend a lot of money to buy paraphernalia, in order to represent their organizations on their campuses.  I believe selling affordable and ‘eco-friendly’ items will alleviate the stress on our wallets and on our planet.
 
What I Need & What You Get:
I have been saving up and bootstrapping to put towards the business but I still need resources to help it grow.  I have been operating small as a sole-proprietorship, and will use the funds I raise and earn to incorporate my company.  I am also aiming to purchase more items to be able to sell hopefully this summer.  
How much is a dream worth to you?  With just $9 you can help me get closer to my goal.  $9 is a drink (or 2 depending on where you live) at the bar; possibly a movie ticket, a meal…but the $9 (or more) you invest in my dream will put me one step closer to achieving my goal.  
 
For helping my dream grow you will get:
- $9 donation: Since I am God’s favorite child, you will get a whole bunch of good karmic points and a shout-out on my website for helping me out!
- $33 donation: You’ll get some good karma, as well as a 33% one-time discount towards your entire purchase from my website (offer good till September 2011).
- $90 donation: You’ll get good karma, a 33% one-time discount towards your entire purchase AND 1 free item from my website (offer good till September 2011).
- $330 donation: Good karma, 2 free items from my website AND your link/logo featured on my website’s “3x3 Supporters” page (offer good till December 2011).
 
Other Ways You Can Help:
Please SPREAD THE WORD to your friends, family, co-workers, etc…email it, share it on Facebook, Twitter, your blog/site, anywhere you can!  If you help me get the word out about my campaign I’ll also spread the word on your campaign or promotion.  Any help will be greatly appreciated!

<p><span>
    Share files with your friends and family, fast, simple and over the air

<br/><br/>
<p>WiKey notifies you of any incoming calls, messages, social media alerts,
    emails etc. using it's integrated speaker and multicolor LED.
    You can also set custom alerts or modify existing simply by using the
    mobile app.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/5b3rvxT.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/><br/>
<p>Integrate your WiKey with Apple Health, Google Fit, Xbox Live and other
    apps and services to track your fitness goals, accept Xbox Live gaming
    matches, turn up the heating, lock the doors. Enable network media sharing
	and access WiKey from your game consoles, smart TVs and other media devices with network access and stream content directly to them.</p>

            Say Hello to WiKey


After a lot of stolen and lost USB flash drives, we decided to
    build something that we will use ourselves to avoid buying a new one each month and prevent losing
    important files.
WiKey is the next-gen key chain which works like a personal cloud
    computer, fitness tracker, remote control and much more.

    Share files with your friends and family, fast, simple and over the air
    instead of using slower, unsecure and easy to lose USB flash drives. Have all
    your files with you, all the time, wherever you go.Important Note: WiKey doesn't upload your data to the cloud. It stores all your files on its internal memory. For all further info mail us at tellmemore@hellowikey.com


WiKey notifies you of any incoming calls, messages, social media alerts,
    emails etc. using it's integrated speaker and multicolor LED.
    You can also set custom alerts or modify existing simply by using the
    mobile app.


Integrate your WiKey with Apple Health, Google Fit, Xbox Live and other
    apps and services to track your fitness goals, accept Xbox Live gaming
    matches, turn up the heating, lock the doors. Enable network media sharing
	and access WiKey from your game consoles, smart TVs and other media devices with network access and stream content directly to them.

Technical Details




WiKey is built for everyday use and with that in mind we had to build

    conditions yet small and practical. To ensure long battery life, we kept it
    simple and used a smart RGB LED to display all the information required. It
    can display custom alerts, show battery percentage, signal strength and

<li>“It also bothers me when I have to go through more additional security measures to access my things, or get locked out of my own account because I forgot as I accidentally typed in my password incorrectly”, found among participants comments.</li>

Obviously, you never see the details, but behind the scenes, it provides a robust secure infrastructure as a way to protect your passwords, credit cards and the login credentials of Windows Hello unlock authentication solution.</p><p>The secure chip that is used in Hio key is an ARM® TrustZone® Cryptocell chip which ensures your credentials of any type are real, untampered, and confidential.

This includes protection for passwords to all websites and applications, credit card and other sensitive data. Hio, a PIN capable device, provides industry leading security so you can be confident that no one can read your data even if your Hio key is lost or stolen.

This means an attacker in possession of Hio key can’t get access to data without the PIN. To further discourage brute-force passcode attacks, there are escalating time delays after 5 consecutive incorrect attempts to enter the Pin. With a six-character alphanumeric code, it would take many years for thieves and computer programs to try all combinations. This is to safeguard your data in case you lose your Hio key and someone tries to use it without your authorization.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552736882/fhzklcegunhk3hsf8qoj.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552736941/dlwsindutbakhh62qrgr.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552737051/qsysa09cf5qisjqvx9tb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/023/935/648/3d2ead7324e16b1c904c32f054046bf3_original.gif?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1548842467&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b715f0faa8ba761e04dbde830e86ab01"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552737193/vexc4eoy38q9rn4ks6oo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552737335/j0m3hkojpzjd7o0ndemh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/006/647/cee82587e94267488b565ff00342c034_original.gif?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1549443581&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=67b39483262ec075a9b14fc76436db0c"" src=""""/></p><p>If you regularly lock your PC when you leave your desk, then I'll say you will be happy with Hio.

Hio provides a huge security experience, available to the individuals or businesses, on getting secure and fast access to all the devices. It alleviates the security burden of traditional password-based authentication to protect internet users worldwide. Hio relies on hardware to keep all the sensitive data you have, such as passwords and credit cards, physically protected. With Hio, now, sign-in is secure and even much easier on any device simply by a click or double-tap. It ensures your privacy by immediately locking your PC when you walk away, and unlocking your PC when you walk back using a standard password-less authentication solution. We would like to keep Hio growing by expanding its functionalities and enhancing its appearance as long as possible. Here are what we would like to add if we manage to exceed our initial Kickstarter goal.We've perfected a leather keychain that is handcrafted from high-quality genuine leather. The leather now comes in Gray color with a simple, functional design. Incorporating a very stylish solid ring, Hio keychain can simply be used for your other physical keys for added peace of mind.Due to the nature of the leather and because each individual item is made by hand, you can expect that each one will be unique.Handing data off to a public cloud provider poses many security and privacy concerns. As data is stored distantly and is accessible from anywhere on the internet if a data breach occurs via hacking your data can be compromised. Breaches across almost every public cloud service continue to be regularly reported by the media.In cloud-based password manager, as user security information is stored on the cloud, passwords, payment information, and much more, your entire password database is vulnerable to a data breach. When a data breach occurs, no amount of protection will keep your users’ accounts protected. Hio goes completely cloud-less, keeping all your data securely encrypted inside the chip. No data will be stored, exchanged or even computed on the Internet keeping users protected against hacking and data breaches. In today's increasingly interconnected world, a majority of computer users are suffering from “security fatigue”- a weariness or reluctance to deal with computer security- that exposes online users to risky computing behavior at work and in their personal lives, according to a new study by government scientists. This can cause computer users to feel hopeless and overwhelmed by security.
“I get tired of remembering my username and passwords.”, was a resentful testimony of one of the participants in a recent US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) study. 
“Years ago, you had one password to keep up with at work,” added another irked participant in this study. “Now people are being asked to remember 25 or 30. We haven’t really thought about cybersecurity expanding and what it has done to people”.
“It also bothers me when I have to go through more additional security measures to access my things, or get locked out of my own account because I forgot as I accidentally typed in my password incorrectly”, found among participants comments.
In this video from NIST, Mary Theofanos explains the idea of security fatigue and how users are bogged down by too many decisions involving their online security.Hio emphasizes sophisticated security protocols, ensuring absolute device safety, for keeping all the sensitive information you have physically protected inside the chip. It gives you a simple way to access websites and applications that doesn’t involve memorizing a long list of unrelated characters. You don’t need to spend time filling out fields of information, trying to understand complex instructions, or thinking up a secure password and username for the account. It automatically prompts you to store passwords physically secure when you are logging to a website for the first time. Managing passwords with Hio is super easy; all you need to sign in, is, just a click or double-tap on the Hio key.  Never worry about locking your PC as you leave your vicinity with it. With Magic Lock, now, Hio simply figures out and immediately locks your PC in your absence. No one else is offering an automatic locking system with such accuracy and effectiveness. We have applied a powerful, movement-based solution which allows you to select your desired distance from the four predefined options: 2-step, 4-step, 6-step, and 8-step.
Constantly collect and analyze accelerometer data to detect user movement
Check for the availability or strength of the Bluetooth signal to avoid false alarm
If the user walked beyond the determined step threshold and the Bluetooth signal is weak the screen will be locked instantaneously
Hio, as a Windows Hello companion device, enriches user authentication experience for Windows 10.
Wait for user to click or press the spacebar on the keyboard
Check for the availability or strength of the Bluetooth connection
The PC will be unlocked if you are about 2 steps close to your PCLike the other security keys, Hio key has a specific secure chip by which it performs cryptographic functions triggered by a push button. Obviously, you never see the details, but behind the scenes, it provides a robust secure infrastructure as a way to protect your passwords, credit cards and the login credentials of Windows Hello unlock authentication solution.The secure chip that is used in Hio key is an ARM® TrustZone® Cryptocell chip which ensures your credentials of any type are real, untampered, and confidential. It features hardware acceleration for the NIST standard prime curve and supports the complete key life cycle from high quality private key generation to ECDSA signature generation, ECDH key agreement, and ECDSA public key signature verification. As the result, we keep the user’s secrets securely protected inside the chip with the hardware protection. This includes protection for passwords to all websites and applications, credit card and other sensitive data. Hio, a PIN capable device, provides industry leading security so you can be confident that no one can read your data even if your Hio key is lost or stolen. The credentials contained in the Hio key belong to the end-user exclusively and are never transferred, copied or stored by a service provider or any other application provider.​By setting up a device Pin, the user automatically enables enhanced transaction security over sensitive information. This means an attacker in possession of Hio key can’t get access to data without the PIN. To further discourage brute-force passcode attacks, there are escalating time delays after 5 consecutive incorrect attempts to enter the Pin. With a six-character alphanumeric code, it would take many years for thieves and computer programs to try all combinations. This is to safeguard your data in case you lose your Hio key and someone tries to use it without your authorization. If you regularly lock your PC when you leave your desk, then I'll say you will be happy with Hio. It can guarantee your privacy by triggering to lock your PC when you forget to lock your PC or tablet when you step away. Perhaps when you leave your desk for a cup of coffee or to have a conversation with your colleague. Additionally, Hio key can be used as a companion device instead of a password to sign in faster and more secure to your Windows devices, apps and Microsoft Edge websites.Logging to a website from anywhere with any platform is easily achievable just by a click or double-tap. Hio saves users from the hassle of entering password on each time getting access to websites and applications. It gives users a simple way to access that doesn’t involve memorizing a long list of characters. Hio is a hardware digital wallet that allows you to do away with physical cards. It enriches user experience with online shopping for all e-commerce websites. Thus, when you’re checking out online, there’s no more need to go find your wallet and painstakingly type in your credit card number.We have built an amazing secure key that is ready to go, right out of the box. We have suppliers in place and prototype is already complete. The next step is to move to mass production, to create molds, prepare assemblies, with all the same level of quality. This requires investment, and we hope to earn your support to launch the product and grow the community.Hio guarantees complex passwords, auto-fills passwords across all well-known browsers and mobile applications. Managing passwords with Hio is super easy; all you need to start, is, just a click or tap on the Hio key.  Through all platforms, Hio provides the highest level of convenience and functionality the users expect regarding OSs restrictions. It is already available for Windows, iOS, and Android, and is under development for Mac OS. In Windows and Mac OS desktop systems, Hio uses the extensions to manage user’s passwords across all popular browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and safari. It allows you to control all your account easily through your PC, Laptop, tablet or smartphone.  A cheerful and intuitive user interface designed in-house, delivering easy management for accounts, quick access to accounts’ data, proximity, security, and device connection settings. Compatible with various devices and platforms including Windows, Android, iOS and Mac OS, offering a similar set of features to all, Hio is your perfect companion device regardless of your device preference. Completely cloud-less, it connects seamlessly by Bluetooth to your device and ensures information is accessible anytime, anyplace using any device.   For IT and Business segment, Hio is going to be a great gadget in the world providing an awesomely secure experience in getting access to your accounts anywhere using any device, a personal laptop, smartphone, or from a shared computer in an office, library, laboratory, and etc. The heart of our fast-speed technology, the custom PCB, is assembled with an advanced Bluetooth 5 Nordic SoC (nRF52 Series), security module, accelerometer sensor, LED, and a button. Hio now features a replaceable battery, but depending on how much we raise on this campaign it may be upgraded with a rechargeable technology.  Risk and ChallengesAs with any hardware product, there are always risks and challenges with creating and delivering a new smart device. We already have fully working prototypes that have demonstrated all the key functionality.Now, we are working hard on all parts of the product, including hardware and software, trying to make it more powerful. Our firmware and the Windows application, including extension support for Edge, Chrome, and Firefox are also almost at the final stage. The other accompanying apps for smartphones and Mac OS are being developed and are on track.We are confident that we have the right talent and resources in place to meet our deadline and release Hio to you.

<p>A: Yes, you can print on wood, glass, plastic, metal and any other glossy surfaces with the quick drying ink cartridge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can Selpic S1 print on black surfaces?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can print on black surfaces with white water-based ink cartridge developed by Selpic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the maximum dimension that can be printed?</strong></p>
<p>A: The maximum dimension of printing is about 12.7x500mm. If you want to print the pattern with larger dimensions, you can also use the multi-line feature with the help of rulers to put them together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I adjust the design of printing on my phone?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can set the layout and change the designs as you like on Selpic iOS/Android App as well as Windows/Mac software before printing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Who makes your ink? And where do they buy their ink cartridges? Are the ink cartridges new or refill?</strong></p>
<p>A: Our cartridges and ink are self-developed and 100% new. We don't use refilled cartridges that some of our competing products use. Our cartridges are filled with 40ml of quick-drying or water-based ink depending on your selection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use ink cartridge made by a different manufacturer such as HP ink for my Selpic S1+?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, it is compatible with other brand's ink. But I still highly recommend you to use the Selpic self-developed Ink Cartridge and that’s the one perfectly fit the Selpic S1, choosing the wrong ink cartridge may cause your printer not working.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:  How long does the ink last on shirts and other washable objects?</strong></p>
<p>A: The printing will last for a long time until you wash it or it’s soaked with water or sweat, which will wash away the ink. If you want a permanent printing, we recommend you to take our quick-drying ink cartridge, which uses the eco-solvent ink.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the shelf-life of the ink?</strong></p>
<p>A: That depends. Normally, the shelf life of the water-based ink cartridge is about 18 months if you stored properly in the correct environment, while the service life of quick-drying ink cartridge is only 6 months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Normally, how often do I need to refill or change the cartridge?</strong></p>
<p>A: A single cartridge can print up to 900 A4 paper. If you need to replace the cartridges, you can purchase the corresponding cartridges on our official website after the campaign ends at <a href=""https://selpic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">selpic.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Is it easy to clean the prints after printing?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, it is pretty easy. You can simply remove them with 95% rubbing alcohol.</p>

A: Yes, it is compatible with other brand's ink. But I still highly recommend you to use the Selpic self-developed Ink Cartridge and that’s the one perfectly fit the Selpic S1, choosing the wrong ink cartridge may cause your printer not working.
 
Q:  How long does the ink last on shirts and other washable objects?
A: The printing will last for a long time until you wash it or it’s soaked with water or sweat, which will wash away the ink. If you want a permanent printing, we recommend you to take our quick-drying ink cartridge, which uses the eco-solvent ink.
 
Q: What is the shelf-life of the ink?
A: That depends. Normally, the shelf life of the water-based ink cartridge is about 18 months if you stored properly in the correct environment, while the service life of quick-drying ink cartridge is only 6 months.
 
Q: Normally, how often do I need to refill or change the cartridge?
A: A single cartridge can print up to 900 A4 paper. If you need to replace the cartridges, you can purchase the corresponding cartridges on our official website after the campaign ends at selpic.com
 
Q: Is it easy to clean the prints after printing?
A: Yes, it is pretty easy. You can simply remove them with 95% rubbing alcohol.",48.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<h1>&gt;&gt;&gt; High level language with low level control</h1>
<p>The core of the software running in the WiPy is <a href=""http://www.micropython.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MicroPython</a>, a lean and mean implementation of Python 3, specifically optimized in terms of speed and memory to be able to run efficiently on microcontrollers. </p>

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/593/715/8a0650759c312518c59ee68a7d24a104_original.png?v=1428703350&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=7c1df1e2417c8d9a958b22a9abc35944"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p></a><p>MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including exceptions, ""with"", ""yield from"", and so on). Most of the core datatypes are provided: str (including basic Unicode support), bytes, bytearray, tuple, list, dict, set, frozenset, array.array, collections.namedtuple, classes and instances. You named it, it's likely there. MicroPython is in constant development, so new features are added all the time (for example, it already has some of the features of the upcoming Python 3.5).</p>
<p></p>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Python?</h1>
<p>Python is a novice friendly language, very often selected by many schools to teach kids the basics of computer software, and yet, it's in the core of professional applications and frameworks which drive the modern Internet (e.g: Django and Flask). Python offers high-level language features and libraries, yet it allows to go low level when fine grain control and real time behavior are needed, and MicroPython takes full advantage of all that.</p>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>&gt;&gt;&gt; Infinite possibilities</h1>
<p>MicroPython has already changed the way microcontroller programming is done, and the WiPy extends it to the realm of the Internet Of Things. We want you to be part of this revolution, and we will be right next to you on every step of the way.</p>
<p>The WiPy is all about openness and freedom. The whole software has been open source since the beginning, and it will always be. When this campaign gets successfully funded, we will make the hardware open source as well. You can already fork the source code directly from the <a href=""https://github.com/micropython/micropython"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MicroPython official repository</a>.</p>

<p>So what about the freedom? One of the best things about the WiPy is that it works stand alone.You only need to apply power, before you can start hacking. Forget about needing cloud services to program the board, or special tools to compile your code before it can run on the hardware. The WiPy executes your Python scripts in real time. The only thing you need to start having fun with the WiPy is... a WiFi connection. You can use any independent cloud service to interconnect your devices, there are no strings attached, the only limit is your imagination. What you do with the WiPy, is completely up to you! </p>

<h1><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; Developing is now fun!</b></h1>
<p>How do you start developing with the WiPy? Very simple. Apply power to the board (almost any 3.6 - 5.5V source would do), the WiPy will boot the complete WiFi subsystem and the Python interpreter in less than a second. You will see a new wireless network called ""wipy-wlan"". Connect to it, the default password is: <i><b><a href=""http://www.wipy.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wipy.io</a></b></i>. Enjoy the ride!</p>

<h1><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; Why Indiegogo?</b></h1>
<p>The WiPy is a powerful and super flexible IoT development board and we want to share it with the whole world. We believe that Python running on microcontrollers is the future of embedded systems. Not so long ago, embedded software was written almost entirely in assembly, and everyone was very skeptical about C. Now we are witnessing the dawn of a new era, and Python is the star of the show. There is still a lot to be done before we can get there, so we are asking you to join us in what's going to be a really fun journey. MicroPython has built a strong community and we want to make it bigger. With your help, we can continue improving it and expanding it to more platforms.</p>

Sounds nice, but how do you that? Here is the answer...>>> Meet the WiPyA small, super low power, inexpensive, and 100% Python programmable IoT development board. The WiPy takes the wireless freedom of WiFi and combines it with the power, flexibility, and ease of use of Python. We designed the WiPy from the ground up, with one goal in mind: ""Let's make IoT development fun both for beginners and professionals"".


Inexpensive, small and breadboard friendly.
Ultra low power (850uA with the WiFi connection active)
100% PYTHON PROGRAMMABLE.
Lots of GPIOs, interfaces and peripherals.
Powerful CPU and state of the art WiFi radio.




>>> Things you can build with the WiPy

Internet connected lights.
WiFi controlled robots.
Cloud connected sensors.
Smart fridge magnets.
WiFi remote controls.
Smart power sockets.
Security systems.
And much more!


>>> High level language with low level control
The core of the software running in the WiPy is MicroPython, a lean and mean implementation of Python 3, specifically optimized in terms of speed and memory to be able to run efficiently on microcontrollers. 

MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including exceptions, ""with"", ""yield from"", and so on). Most of the core datatypes are provided: str (including basic Unicode support), bytes, bytearray, tuple, list, dict, set, frozenset, array.array, collections.namedtuple, classes and instances. You named it, it's likely there. MicroPython is in constant development, so new features are added all the time (for example, it already has some of the features of the upcoming Python 3.5).


>>> Why Python?
Python is a novice friendly language, very often selected by many schools to teach kids the basics of computer software, and yet, it's in the core of professional applications and frameworks which drive the modern Internet (e.g: Django and Flask). Python offers high-level language features and libraries, yet it allows to go low level when fine grain control and real time behavior are needed, and MicroPython takes full advantage of all that.

>>> Infinite possibilities
MicroPython has already changed the way microcontroller programming is done, and the WiPy extends it to the realm of the Internet Of Things. We want you to be part of this revolution, and we will be right next to you on every step of the way.
The WiPy is all about openness and freedom. The whole software has been open source since the beginning, and it will always be. When this campaign gets successfully funded, we will make the hardware open source as well. You can already fork the source code directly from the MicroPython official repository.


So what about the freedom? One of the best things about the WiPy is that it works stand alone.You only need to apply power, before you can start hacking. Forget about needing cloud services to program the board, or special tools to compile your code before it can run on the hardware. The WiPy executes your Python scripts in real time. The only thing you need to start having fun with the WiPy is... a WiFi connection. You can use any independent cloud service to interconnect your devices, there are no strings attached, the only limit is your imagination. What you do with the WiPy, is completely up to you! 



>>> Developing is now fun!
How do you start developing with the WiPy? Very simple. Apply power to the board (almost any 3.6 - 5.5V source would do), the WiPy will boot the complete WiFi subsystem and the Python interpreter in less than a second. You will see a new wireless network called ""wipy-wlan"". Connect to it, the default password is: www.wipy.io. Enjoy the ride!



 PLAY



>>> Pymakr IDE
A fully featured IDE that connects automatically to your Pycom devices via Telnet Server or serial port, runs your code on the fly, manages the internal file system, synchronizes your code instantly and runs it with just one click. It also takes care of firmware upgrades and includes a built in console that interfaces with the MicroPython REPL. Features code completion, static analysis, PEP8 style checking and a built-in interactive prompt.

>>> Wireless programmingStart a telnet session, and get access to the Python interactive shell, which is perfect for testing your code on the fly.Open your favorite FTP client and connect to the WiPy's full blown FTP server, which gives you complete access to the file system. You can add and remove files or directories, and of course upload your Python scripts.>>> OTA updatesOver The Air updates are super easy via the FTP server. Upload the new firmware to the WiPy and reset it, that's it. You can even try your own tweaks on the MicroPython interpreter. You don't have to worry about bricking the WiPy, because the factory firmware is always preserved and you can always roll back using the safe boot pin. >>> What about support?Join our active community of WiPy and micropython hackers at the MicroPython Forum!Also checkout our github repository where you will find examples and libraries!...or simply Support@pycom.io>>> Everything you already love, in a shiny new packageOther WiFi boards have appeared during the last year directed to IoT. And you might think, ""yet another platform..."", guess what? it's not. Because it runs Python, and it works just like the Python you are used to work with on a computer, so the learning curve is minimal, if there's any at all. Simply put, the WiPy is all about Python and the internet, but taken to the next level.>>> Flexible stack-able design>>> Top notch hardware

Size: 25mm x 45mm (1.0"" x 1.77"")  

MCU: Cortex-M4 @ 80MHz (TI CC3200)

WiFi: 802.11b/g/n 16Mbps (AP, Station and WiFi-Direct)

RAM: 256 KBytes

Flash: 2 MBytes

GPIO: Up to 25

Interfaces: UART (x2), SPI, I2C, I2S, SD card

Analog channels: 3x12 bit ADCs

Timers: 4x16 bit with PWM and input capture

RTC: Of course

Hash and encryption engines: SHA, MD5, DES, AES

DMA: All over the place

3.3V output: Capable of sourcing up to 250mA
The heart of the WiPy hardware is the CC3200 from TI, a powerful Cortex-M4 MCU combined with a state of the art WiFi network processor. The CC3200 is also the first system on chip to have achieved chip-level WiFi certification. The CC3200 is fully loaded with features, including SSL, and TLS, meaning that you connect everything to the cloud, safely and reliably.The WiPy is also breadboard friendly, and there is an ultra low noise voltage regulator that provides a 3.3V output that you can use to power external components. The supply input has a reverse voltage protection, to make your life easier.>>> Pin-out
Click to expand>>> Ultra-Low Power (with WiFi still connected!)The WiPy has some impressive low power modes, being capable to maintain the WiFi connection active while only consuming 850uA. When in suspended mode, the WiPy can wake up when receiving internet data, or because a client has connected. This means you can even build an ultra low power server.A battery powered device built with the WiPy can wake from suspended mode in less than 5 ms, send a bunch of internet packets, and go back to sleep immediately, all that within a second. An application using such a scheme can run with a single battery charge for years.

 PLAY

>>> State of the art WiFiThe WiPy comes with WiFi 802.11b/g/n and can be configured as an Access Point, a Station or in WiFi-Direct mode.>>> HTTP, XMPP, MQTT, SMTP, FTP and so onOut of the box the WiPy supports BSD sockets, and everything else can be easily built on top of that using Python. We are preparing a nice set of Python libraries customized for Micro Python to support HTTP, SMTP, XMPP, FTP and MQTT among other network protocols which are essential for the Internet Of Things.>>> HTTPS? You got it! Connecting everything to the internet is super fun, as long as it's safe. The WiPy has you covered with complete SSL and TLS support.>>> Master or slaveMost likely you will use the WiPy as the brains of your project, but if you want it to behave as a WiFi shield for another board (like an Arduino for instance), you can easily write a Python script that will make the WiPy act as the bridge between your device and the Internet.>>> Beautiful Python APIAll those hardware specs are nice, but the coolest part is that they are super easy to use, because we have written an powerful and intuitive Python API to take advantage of every feature of the hardware. Here are a few examples:Controlling GPIO pins:Configuring I2C:...and SPI:Setting up interrupts is a piece of cake:Interrupts can wake the device from suspended mode, including WiFi interrupts (current in this mode is only 850uA, wicked! isn't it?)How about connecting to the internet?Want to send an email?>>> Expandable to your heart's content
You already have lots of expansion and breakout boards, excellent! bring 'em in, because the WiPy is breadboard friendly, and it has plenty of GPIO pins and communication ports so that you can easily connect anything you want without soldering a single wire.
You want custom shields? No problem, select our highest reward and we will design a snake board for the WiPy according to your requirements.

>>> Because of popular demand, we do have an expansion board

<p>Rather than make use of complicated technology, GoTouch uses simple infrared light detection and reliable Bluetooth communication for an enhanced user experience.</p>
<p><strong>GoTouch Sensor</strong><br/>The core technology of the GoTouch is a <strong>4K infrared sensor</strong> that recognizes the GoTouch Pen. It runs at <strong>100 frames per second</strong>, which guarantees a smooth writing experience. With its Li-Poly 250mAh battery, the GoTouch sensor can operate for <strong>up to 4 hours</strong> after each charge. With an external power bank or power supply, you don't need to worry about running out of power during the lengthiest of meetings.</p>
<p><strong>GoTouch Pen </strong>Included with the GoTouch is the GoTouch Pen. Its tip is an infrared LED that allows the infrared sensor to detect where the stylus is being placed on the screen. Using the GoTouch Pen feels like writing on a real whiteboard. Weighing only<strong> 23g </strong>(w/o the batteries), the GoTouch Pen feels naturally comfortable in your hand. Because the tip of the GoTouch Pen is made of silicone, it won’t scratch or cause damage to the surface of your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Infrared interference-eliminating polarization filter</strong><br/>Though the GoTouch is compact and is simple to use, the cutting-edge technology incorporated into it is impressive. We developed our own infrared interference-eliminating, polarization filter to improve the sensor’s ability to detect the infrared light from the GoTouch Pen. Many ordinary objects emit infrared light such as light bulbs, the sun, and even our bodies. So we needed to find a way to limit the cases of interference from other unwanted infrared light sources. And we did just that through the use of our polarization filter; the GoTouch sensor only catches the infrared signal from the GoTouch Pen.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithms for better writing </strong><br/>We applied a ‘writing quality improvement algorithm’ to overcome the problem of wavering infrared light signal to produce clean and smooth lines, and a ‘pen speed detection algorithm’ that transforms the thickness of the line according to the speed of the pen to provide a more realistic and optimized writing experience to GoTouch users.</p>

<p>Our mission is to build a more interactive world by providing dynamic touch technology that enables more visual, interactive, effective communication. The award-winning company was founded in 2012 by Sunghyun “Edward” Lim, who while working as a mobile developer, realized how difficult it was to communicate with people solely using words, especially when transmitting technical information. He founded Anyractive to solve these everyday problems at work or in educational settings by maximizing communication with new technology.</p>
<p>Anyractive’s first product, GoTouch, enhances displays by turning them into a touch screen. Anyractive is based in Seoul, South Korea and has 15 employees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479399358/qaqnplozqbpwdmjlwsfq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The idea for the GoTouch emerged from a common problem that was shared by the developers at Anyractive. It's difficult to communicate solely with words, and even more so when explaining technical information. Immediate and visual feedback while communicating are key factors that lead to better understanding and enhanced productivity in a collaborative environment. Unfortunately, however, there weren’t many options available that enabled people to communicate interactively. Thus was born GoTouch.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479157473/fnfbbiqgbeu49vs62gcn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We’ve been working on GoTouch for more than a year. During the product development process, we focused on one goal: to create a product that would make our interactions truly interactive.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479157582/pzuwr0vm2yimeijowml9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To this end, we participated in numerous technology trade shows to meet users and industry experts to listen to their ideas and share ours. The feedback we receive is invaluable in helping us constantly improve GoTouch.</p>
<p>We are now confident that GoTouch is ready for mass production.</p>

<p><strong>1. How can I know if the sensor is recognizing the pen?</strong><br/><i>When the red light appears in the triangular hole of the sensor, the pen signal is being recognized.</i></p>
<p><strong>2. How can I know when I need to replace the batteries in the pen?</strong><br/><i>When you press the pen tip and a red light comes on, the batteries are fine. If there is no light, it is time to replace the batteries.</i></p>
<p><strong>3. A blue light on the power button is turned on, but I cannot connect Bluetooth to the app.</strong><br/><i>Press the power button for 3 seconds or press the reset button on the bottom.</i></p>
<p><strong>4. What do I do if my GoTouch sensor is not working?</strong><br/><i>You need to charge the sensor using the micro USB cable. If that doesn’t work, press the reset button on the bottom. </i>If that doesn’t work, <i>please contact us via email: <a href=""mailto:support@anyractive.com?subject=Customer%20Message%20from%20Indiegogo%20Campaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@anyractive.com </a></i></p>
<p><strong>5. How much time does it take to fully charge the battery?</strong><br/><i>About 1-2 hours. After the battery is fully charged, the red light on the power button will turn off. You can use it for up to 4 hours if you fully charge the battery.</i></p>
<p><strong>6. What do I do if a red light on the power button is turned on?</strong><br/><i>A red light on the power button means that you need to charge the sensor.</i></p>
<p><strong>7. What do I do if the pen is not working well?</strong><br/><i>If you are in direct sunlight or under a light bulb, move to another place. If that doesn’t work, you need to replace the batteries. If replacing the batteries doesn’t work,<i> </i></i><i>please contact us via email: <a href=""mailto:support@anyractive.com?subject=Customer%20Message%20from%20Indiegogo%20Camapaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@anyractive.com </a></i></p>
<p><strong>8. Does GoTouch work if I stand between the sensor and the </strong><strong>screen?</strong><br/><i>GoTouch needs to be able to ""see"" the infrared pen and the screen in order to work properly. We recommend that you place the GoTouch at a 45º angle to your screen, so you don't inadvertently step in front of the sensor and block the view.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>If you stand on the right side of the screen, place the GoTouch at a 45º angle to the left of the screen.</i></li>
<li><i>If you stand on the left side of the screen, place the GoTouch at a 45º angle to the right of the screen.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>The optimal distance to place the GoTouch from your screen is 1.5X the width of the screen. So, if you have a 50-inch TV, 16x9 screen, approximately 25 inches high by 44 inches wide, place the GoTouch 66 inches or 2 feet away.</i></p>
<p><strong>9. Will there be any lag when you write on a screen?</strong><br/><i>If you have a reliable broadband and Wi-Fi connection, there should be no perceptible lag - it's less than the eye can perceive while you write. If network traffic is very heavy, there could be a lag, but we've spent lots of time on optimization to eliminate lag.</i></p>
<p><strong>10. Can I connect GoTouch to a regular whiteboard?</strong><br/><i>GoTouch needs to be mirrored to a TV or projector to work properly, so it cannot work on an ordinary whiteboard.</i></p>
<p><strong>11. Can I save the screen?</strong><br/><i>You can save the screen within two touches on the TV or projector or on your phone. Just press the G icon in the app and then select ""Save"".</i></p>
<p><strong>12. How do I connect GoTouch to my TV?</strong><br/><i>You actually connect GoTouch to your smartphone, tablet or PC via Bluetooth, and then connect that device to your TV. You have several options to do that:</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i>If you're using an iPhone or iPad, use Apple TV's AirPlay, or connect using a lightning to HDMI cable.</i></li>
<li><i>If you're using Android, you can use a micro USB to HDMI cable, or connect via Chromecast or another screencasting device.</i></li>
<li><i>If you're using a PC, you can connect it to your TV using an HDMI, VGA or DVI cable, depending on your graphics card and the inputs on your TV.</i></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>13. Do you save my annotations, </strong><strong>images,</strong><strong> and videos on your servers?</strong><br/><i>No! Your privacy is very important to us, so we don't store any of your data on our servers. Right now you do need to log-in to use the app. We did this mostly to make group collaboration easier and to offer better customer service. However, we've gotten a lot of questions about the log-in requirement and are considering eliminating it.</i></p>
<p><strong>14. Will the pen damage my screen?</strong><br/><i>We've done lots of testing with lots of TVs, and so far we haven't noticed any damage. You don't need to press the pen very hard to activate the infrared LED, and the nib of the GoTouch Pen is made of silicone. That being said, we wouldn't recommend handing the GoTouch Pen to your two-year-old.</i></p>

GoTouch featured in Digital Trends.
Check it out here: The Anyractive GoTouch transforms electronic screens into digital whiteboards
 


Great ideas begin with a scribble – on a napkin, a chalkboard, or a piece of paper. But these ideas won’t become reality if left alone.
GoTouch gives you the whiteboard of your dreams that you can take with you anywhere. You can bring your scribbled ideas to life with GoTouch, by sharing, collaborating, and presenting them!
 

GoTouch is a portable, easy-to-use device that instantly turns a TV, projector, or any display screen into an interactive digital whiteboard. It comes with a special stylus that allows you to draw on the screen.
 

 

Interactivity Redefined.Collaboration Like Never Before.
GoTouch will transform the way we learn and work.
 

GoTouch brings cutting-edge IR(Infrared) technology into a compact pen and sensor device to the palm of your hand. The sensor tracks the infrared light in the pen tip across the screen and transmits the input to your PC, tablet or smartphone via Bluetooth.
What makes using GoTouch so sensible is that you don’t need to buy any bulky equipment. Use whatever device you have at home, in your office, or your classroom. In most cases, you already have a display screen like a TV, monitor or projector, and an operating system like those on your PC, tablet or smartphone*.(Windows 7 and above with Bluetooth 4.0 and above, Android 4.0 and above, iOS 8.0 and above, MacOS will soon be supported)

Businesses and schools across Korea have been helping us test GoTouch for more than a year. We have received many positive reviews. Here are just a few of the testimonials :
 
""What excites them the most is when we allow them to freely write and draw directly on the TV screen (something they are NOT allowed to do at home).""
- Ms. Ha (27, Daycare Center Teacher)
""The fact that GoTouch enables everyone (from associates in our office in Seoul to those in New York) to write simultaneously on one screen is phenomenal. GoTouch is revolutionizing the way we conduct our conference calls.""    
- Mr. Kim (34, Team leader at a foreign financial firm)
""With GoTouch, one can set up a “smart classroom” with 1/10 of the cost. It’s a groundbreaking product. ""
- Mr. Lee (46, Executive at an education systems company)
 
""The major issues I had with existing electronic whiteboards were the high price and the lack of portability. Now with GoTouch, I can use any screen in the shooting location as a whiteboard. And to think that GoTouch fits in one’s pocket. Wow, that’s amazing! ""
- Ms. Cho (42, Deputy head of an educational broadcasting channel)
 


 
GoTouch uses a 4K Ultra HD CMOS sensor to track the infrared light in the GoTouch Pen, giving it pinpoint accuracy. The sensor runs at 100 frames per second, which is more than 3X faster than the refresh rate of every TV. This means you won’t notice any lag while drawing. 

 


Setup is quick and easy. You will have GoTouch running in a few minutes.
Pair GoTouch with your PC, tablet or smartphone via Bluetooth
Place the GoTouch sensor towards the display screen*
Run a quick screen calibration  
Now you are ready to GoTouch! Yes, it's THAT SIMPLE!
(* In order to use GoTouch, the display screen first needs to be connected to and mirror the screen of your PC, tablet or smartphone via HDMI or wireless connection such as Chrome TV or AppleTV.) 

 


Please Check 'How to Setup GoTouch' Video.
 



Use the GoTouch App to connect your GoTouch to any screen or surface. When you launch the app, you’ll be able to cast a blank whiteboard anywhere. Load a PDF, image, video, and/or website and start writing on it and collaborate with others immediately.
Collaborate with others by creating a group session over the GoTouch network, wherever you and your audience are.
Don’t forget to share your project with your colleagues, students, friends and family. The GoTouch App captures all the ideas contributed to and notes taken on your project anytime you want. You can share your project via email, messenger, AirDrop and/or Android Beam.
Inside the app, the menu lets you select from several tools and options. Load a file, save or share it, and change settings with a simple touch of the GoTouch Pen.

Also, iClassroom (a previous version of GoTouch) for Windows PC is available here. (At present, iClassroom only supports Korean language. We are working excitedly to offer more languages ASAP.)
No GoTouch necessary. You can use the app without a GoTouch to collaborate on documents. 
Go check it out!
 
We already ran multiple tests with a variety of mobile devices.
 

 

Rather than make use of complicated technology, GoTouch uses simple infrared light detection and reliable Bluetooth communication for an enhanced user experience.
GoTouch SensorThe core technology of the GoTouch is a 4K infrared sensor that recognizes the GoTouch Pen. It runs at 100 frames per second, which guarantees a smooth writing experience. With its Li-Poly 250mAh battery, the GoTouch sensor can operate for up to 4 hours after each charge. With an external power bank or power supply, you don't need to worry about running out of power during the lengthiest of meetings.
GoTouch Pen Included with the GoTouch is the GoTouch Pen. Its tip is an infrared LED that allows the infrared sensor to detect where the stylus is being placed on the screen. Using the GoTouch Pen feels like writing on a real whiteboard. Weighing only 23g (w/o the batteries), the GoTouch Pen feels naturally comfortable in your hand. Because the tip of the GoTouch Pen is made of silicone, it won’t scratch or cause damage to the surface of your screen.
Infrared interference-eliminating polarization filterThough the GoTouch is compact and is simple to use, the cutting-edge technology incorporated into it is impressive. We developed our own infrared interference-eliminating, polarization filter to improve the sensor’s ability to detect the infrared light from the GoTouch Pen. Many ordinary objects emit infrared light such as light bulbs, the sun, and even our bodies. So we needed to find a way to limit the cases of interference from other unwanted infrared light sources. And we did just that through the use of our polarization filter; the GoTouch sensor only catches the infrared signal from the GoTouch Pen.
Algorithms for better writing We applied a ‘writing quality improvement algorithm’ to overcome the problem of wavering infrared light signal to produce clean and smooth lines, and a ‘pen speed detection algorithm’ that transforms the thickness of the line according to the speed of the pen to provide a more realistic and optimized writing experience to GoTouch users.

 




 


 


 


 

 
Our mission is to build a more interactive world by providing dynamic touch technology that enables more visual, interactive, effective communication. The award-winning company was founded in 2012 by Sunghyun “Edward” Lim, who while working as a mobile developer, realized how difficult it was to communicate with people solely using words, especially when transmitting technical information. He founded Anyractive to solve these everyday problems at work or in educational settings by maximizing communication with new technology.
Anyractive’s first product, GoTouch, enhances displays by turning them into a touch screen. Anyractive is based in Seoul, South Korea and has 15 employees.
 

The idea for the GoTouch emerged from a common problem that was shared by the developers at Anyractive. It's difficult to communicate solely with words, and even more so when explaining technical information. Immediate and visual feedback while communicating are key factors that lead to better understanding and enhanced productivity in a collaborative environment. Unfortunately, however, there weren’t many options available that enabled people to communicate interactively. Thus was born GoTouch.

We’ve been working on GoTouch for more than a year. During the product development process, we focused on one goal: to create a product that would make our interactions truly interactive.

To this end, we participated in numerous technology trade shows to meet users and industry experts to listen to their ideas and share ours. The feedback we receive is invaluable in helping us constantly improve GoTouch.
We are now confident that GoTouch is ready for mass production.

The current version of GoTouch - GoTouch 1.5 - has been undergoing testing in schools and offices in Korea for the past year. We are pleased to report that GoTouch 1.5 is working seamlessly.
For our backers, we will be delivering the new, more improved version - GoTouch 2.0.


We’ve been honored with several awards in Korea. Some of the awards include: Samsung Wennovation Project Honoree, Certificate of Good Design Selection Recognition, and a Certificate from the Ministry of Science of the Republic of Korea, ICT and Future Planning recognizing our potential for global growth.
 

 


We want to thank each and every one of you for backing our project. We also want to give a special shout out to everyone who has supported us throughout our journey thus far! We are fortunate to have received the support of so many friends, family members, backers, and associates who offered their time, wisdom, and skills to help make GoTouch what it is today.
We couldn’t have done this without you!
Thank you again for backing us and have a good one!!
 


Place the GoTouch sensor on a flat surface. If the location of the sensor changes, recalibration will be needed.
Avoid using GoTouch in direct sunlight or under a light bulb.
Please hold the pen at a 45-degree angle. Holding the pen upright prevents the sensor from detecting the light emitted by the pen.

 

GoTouch comes with a 1-year worldwide replacement warranty.
If you experience any problem(s) with GoTouch please contact our customer satisfaction department via email: support@anyractive.com
 

We’re planning to use Korea Post. You can track your shipment through this website.
 

1. How can I know if the sensor is recognizing the pen?When the red light appears in the triangular hole of the sensor, the pen signal is being recognized.
2. How can I know when I need to replace the batteries in the pen?When you press the pen tip and a red light comes on, the batteries are fine. If there is no light, it is time to replace the batteries.
3. A blue light on the power button is turned on, but I cannot connect Bluetooth to the app.Press the power button for 3 seconds or press the reset button on the bottom.
4. What do I do if my GoTouch sensor is not working?You need to charge the sensor using the micro USB cable. If that doesn’t work, press the reset button on the bottom. If that doesn’t work, please contact us via email: support@anyractive.com 
5. How much time does it take to fully charge the battery?About 1-2 hours. After the battery is fully charged, the red light on the power button will turn off. You can use it for up to 4 hours if you fully charge the battery.
6. What do I do if a red light on the power button is turned on?A red light on the power button means that you need to charge the sensor.
7. What do I do if the pen is not working well?If you are in direct sunlight or under a light bulb, move to another place. If that doesn’t work, you need to replace the batteries. If replacing the batteries doesn’t work, please contact us via email: support@anyractive.com 
8. Does GoTouch work if I stand between the sensor and the screen?GoTouch needs to be able to ""see"" the infrared pen and the screen in order to work properly. We recommend that you place the GoTouch at a 45º angle to your screen, so you don't inadvertently step in front of the sensor and block the view.

If you stand on the right side of the screen, place the GoTouch at a 45º angle to the left of the screen.
If you stand on the left side of the screen, place the GoTouch at a 45º angle to the right of the screen.

The optimal distance to place the GoTouch from your screen is 1.5X the width of the screen. So, if you have a 50-inch TV, 16x9 screen, approximately 25 inches high by 44 inches wide, place the GoTouch 66 inches or 2 feet away.
9. Will there be any lag when you write on a screen?If you have a reliable broadband and Wi-Fi connection, there should be no perceptible lag - it's less than the eye can perceive while you write. If network traffic is very heavy, there could be a lag, but we've spent lots of time on optimization to eliminate lag.
10. Can I connect GoTouch to a regular whiteboard?GoTouch needs to be mirrored to a TV or projector to work properly, so it cannot work on an ordinary whiteboard.
11. Can I save the screen?You can save the screen within two touches on the TV or projector or on your phone. Just press the G icon in the app and then select ""Save"".
12. How do I connect GoTouch to my TV?You actually connect GoTouch to your smartphone, tablet or PC via Bluetooth, and then connect that device to your TV. You have several options to do that:

If you're using an iPhone or iPad, use Apple TV's AirPlay, or connect using a lightning to HDMI cable.
If you're using Android, you can use a micro USB to HDMI cable, or connect via Chromecast or another screencasting device.
If you're using a PC, you can connect it to your TV using an HDMI, VGA or DVI cable, depending on your graphics card and the inputs on your TV.

13. Do you save my annotations, images, and videos on your servers?No! Your privacy is very important to us, so we don't store any of your data on our servers. Right now you do need to log-in to use the app. We did this mostly to make group collaboration easier and to offer better customer service. However, we've gotten a lot of questions about the log-in requirement and are considering eliminating it.
14. Will the pen damage my screen?We've done lots of testing with lots of TVs, and so far we haven't noticed any damage. You don't need to press the pen very hard to activate the infrared LED, and the nib of the GoTouch Pen is made of silicone. That being said, we wouldn't recommend handing the GoTouch Pen to your two-year-old.

This means that it not only feels great in your hand, but it can flex to accommodate almost all brands of earbuds. </p>
<p>The reason Wrap'It is an improvement over other headphone organizers you may have seen on the market is because of the fact that it attaches directly to your device. Other organizers are simply thrown back in your pocket or purse and separated from the device you actually need them for. With Wrap'It, you always have your headphones where you need them, when you need them. Wrap'It is the <strong>ONLY</strong> headphone organizer that attaches with a electronics safe suction cup. and thanks to our extensive patent it will stay this way.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a common problem to manifest into a simple solution. Wrap'It is the solution for tangled and knotted headphones. Not only will Wrap'It make you life easier it will also help extend the life of your expensive earbuds by eliminating harmful kinks and knots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where Wrap'It is now</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to some incredibly supportive family members we have been able to do our first very small production run of Wrap'It. <strong>But we need help</strong>! this is where you, the kickstarter community, comes in. With the money that you pledge we will be able to market Wrap'It and get the word out that this product exists so it can begin helping people! We will also be able to create more inventory, as well as create an Ecommerce website to sell Wrap'It online. We also want to expand the Wrap'It brand with new colors and customizations as well as Wrap'It in different sizes for larger cords. </p>
<p> Please consider backing this start up company so that together we can make Wrap'It a household name and never have to waste another minute untangling headphones again.

<h1>We need your help.</h1>
<p>To help reach our goal of putting one of these proposed devices on the ears of a happy child, we need your financial help in the initial stages of this endeavor.</p>
<p>This project will be broken up in <strong>four phases </strong>where crowdsourcing will have the biggest impact with the first two:</p>
<p>Phase 0 - Preliminary testing for prototyping. This step will include testing of energy harvesting, development of audio processing, and complete circuit design of working device. During this phase we will also have a better understanding of the financial needs of the next step. </p>
<p>Phase 1 - Development of device. This step will be focused on developing a completely usable device, including complete electrical engineering and industrial design collaborations. The largest bulk of development will occur here.</p>
<p>Phase 2 - Manufacturing process development for mass production.</p>
<p>Phase 3 - Entering the market and appealing to philanthropic investors.</p>
<h1>Beginning Phase 0</h1>
<p>An initial funding of 550 US dollars from crowdsourcing will be enough for making and testing a working prototype. Component costs have been calculated to be roughly $250 which will include energy harvesting components, audio processing chips, microphones, and speakers. An extra $300 buffer is needed in case components are damaged during testing or for unforeseen costs and to cover processing fees. Rising above the $550 goal would be beneficial in completing this work faster in order to begin the tougher and financially weighted Phase 1.</p>
<p>Although we would love to give rewards in return for your generous investments, at this stage we cannot afford to redirect funds. However, at the start of Phase 1, we plan to offer exciting, creative, and generous rewards.</p>
