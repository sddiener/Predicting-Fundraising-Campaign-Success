While you’re at it, make sure you make it look gooood…. Think you have that combination of beauty, brains and bravado to be a Bollywood star? Only one way to find out, play The Bollywood Game! ""The Bollywood Game is a fun game, it played out like a Bollywood movie. Just when you think you may win, someone comes in and back stabs you. I would recommend this game for anyone's collection."" Amanda Harcrow - Play & Take Volunteer at MechaCon ""The Bollywood Game is a fun way to introduce a different culture, it taps into elements of Indian Cinema with charm and creativity."" Edu ""Cammyplayer"" - Support Team at Vale do Ludo""The Bollywood Game is a wonderful new medium to experience the intensity of this phenomenal industry through this ancient yet contemporized form of table top gameplay. It's a testament to the power of ideas & the evolution of concepts into different forms of engagements.""Kenneth Hopkins - Founder at BollyconOne of the main reasons why Bollywood is so popular around the world is because of certain patterns. From song and dance to unexpected plot twists, a movie is not Bollywood if it doesn’t live up to common expectations.The Bollywood Game has been designed around such patterns, bringing to life a typical Bollywood movie but in a card game format. It allows fans to immerse in a world they are familiar with, but in a different and engaging format. It also introduces a whole new genre to people who have never watched a Bollywood movie before.In Bollywood, the leading stars are known colloquially as heroes and heroines. In The Bollywood Game, players get a chance to become one. Our premise started from translating what it takes to be a hero or a heroine in Bollywood through attribute points. Players are able to keep track of each of their attribute points (Strength, Charm and Kindness) through round tokens.Each Hero or Heroine card comes with a set of attribute points, then becoming the objective of the game - win over the card on the table with enough points along with the Happy Ending card.But before the happy ending, each aspiring hero(ine) will fight for points by playing Song cards - what's Bollywood without them?In Bollywood, song and dance are rarely performed alone, so get your Extras ready or better yet your Best Friend, who will never leave your side... errr sometimes. You must be careful while playing your Song cards, other players might Steal the Scene or play an Unrehearsed Choreography card against you.As in the movies, luck will sometimes be by your side - what if all of a sudden you acquire Superhuman Power or when sometimes one of the Gods of Bollywood decides to do a cameo appearance alongside you taking you one step closer to stardom.Be strategic with the fights you pick, you might end up facing the Auntie, the Vamp and the Crime Lord and his pack of thugs all in the same movie! And if drama is what you are in for, play no other than Bollywood, because after an Intermission, the most unthinkable Plot Twist can happen and your opponent becomes you!Our first attempt towards bringing the game to life was thought around the concept of hand-painted Bollywood posters, and bring this almost extinct tradition to a new medium. In the end we were inspired by early Raj Comics' publications and opted for a more fresh concept around a game-friendly and action-oriented look, the idea of merging Bollywood and game gave us the space to adopt a Japanese manga-inspired art work. When it came down to designing the card itself, we took inspiration from a staple design presence in India: matchbox labels. The idea was to not only frame the illustration but bring a certain Indian kitsch look and feel.Each card tells a story, basically a situation which will take your own story further. These 2-liners are written using a font created for the game inspired by such classics as the font used for 1978's 'Don'.The logo and cover art had to depict a movie poster, we decided to adopt bright bold and all caps lettering inspired mainly by 1970s Bollywood, while the cover art brings together the 'cast', including protagonists and their supporting stars, the good and the evil sides of the story. And for the packaging our goal was to emulate movies, since this is a card game that plays out just like one. The idea of a VHS-inspired packaging was a natural fit, not only as a beautiful and different case for the components of the game but also because it brings back the feeling of an analog experience, much like tabletop gaming in general.  
All items will be shipped from Vancouver, Canada, primarily using Canada Post. 
One box of 'The Bollywood Game' weighs approximately 0.5kg/1.1lbs.
Shipping will be charged once the campaign ends.
As per our research with Canada Post, shipping cost should be between CAD$11 and CAD$25 depending on your location. 
Shipping cost may rise due to weight increase as a new item can be unlocked via stretch goal.
Taxes and duties may apply depending on your location.
  100% of the project has been developed prior to the campaign, including art, layout, copy and packaging. As this is our first crowdfunding project we had to make sure everything is in place before the campaign goes live. We will start the production process with our selected printing partner in the Vancouver area as soon as the campaign is over, and we will work towards delivering the product before the estimated delivery date.All backers will be periodically informed about the status of the project. 'The Bollywood Game: Horror Expansion' is a deck of 45 cards based on Bollywood horror films that will be played along with your original 'The Bollywood Game' deck. The expansion deck will add new gameplay, new strategies and new stories to your original game experience, including:
12 music cards (1 all-new music card)
14 actor cards (1 all-new actor card)
13 action cards (8 all-new action cards)
5 counter cards (2 all-new counter cards)
1 double-sided card, showcasing an all new Hero/Heroine and respective attributes
Packaging

Art work for  7 cards
Copy work for 12 cards
Layout work for 12 cards
Packaging design (standard card game package with original illustration based on the cards of the expansion deck)
All backers will be periodically informed about the status of the project. The Bollywood Game was first conceived in 2015, when 3 friends decided to share their love for Bollywood in a game format.Since then, and after an initial positive feedback from close friends, they decided to take the idea forward and after extensive testing sessions across India, Brazil, Canada and the US the game is made available first on Indiegogo.What started as a side project has now enticed the creation of a game studio called Joguinhu, based in Canada and Brazil and working on different analog gaming projects.The Bollywood Game is Joguinhu’s first crowdfunding project.  For any queries or requests, you can also write to: play.joguinhu@gmail.com   Risks and challenges:100% of 'The Bollywood Game' has been developed prior to the campaign, once it ends we will start production with our printing partner in the Vancouver area. Our decision to print in Canada has to do with the fact that we will be able to keep a close eye at all steps of the production process.All items we decided to take ahead into our campaign are game-related and print-related, which means they are within our scope and we will be able to deliver them along with the product itself thus saving on shipping costs.If we reach the stretch goal the remaining cards for 'The Bollywood Game: Horror Expansion' will go into illustration and layout work as soon as the campaign ends - according to the experience we've had with the game so far, this would require approximately 3-4 weeks to start printing the expansion deck.All items will be shipped from Vancouver, Canada, primarily using Canada Post.

<p>The Gnostic Tarot has been 20 years in the making. Begun in 2000, each card is a reproduction of a uniquely created, full-size oil painting. Based on the Perennial Wisdom of the Gnostics, the entire deck has been carefully researched and thought out with a special focus on Querents reading for themselves. Using the psychology of Carl Jung, a self-described modern-day Gnostic, this deck is uniquely geared for soul-searching, spiritual contemplation, and Shadow work. </p> <p>The Gnostics were a sect of spiritual seekers who relied on a first-hand experience of the Divine rather than the orthodox pontifications of a self-appointed clergy. As a result, they were branded heretics by the Catholic Church. Their pursuit of inner experience continued in secret, appearing through the ages in such groups as the Cathars, the Alchemists, the Theosophists, and mystics the world over. Jung viewed Gnosticism as a map to the development of the human psyche based on an experiential awareness of the Self. The Gnostic Tarot is an expansion of this idea of psychological Individuation and spiritual awareness drawing on the traditional understanding of Tarot meaning as refined by the Golden Dawn. </p> <p>Each suit of the Minor Arcana is represented by its corresponding element: Fire [Wands], Water [Cups], Air [Swords], and Earth [Pentacles]. The 22 cards of the Major Arcana echo the traditional Marseille and Rider-Waite-Smith Tarots, while adding unique meanings and allusions of their own from psychology and esoteric teaching. Each Court card is represented by an Archetype. In place of out-dated royalty, these Archetypes are represented by a Boy and Girl and a Man and Woman. The Male suits of Fire and Air are headed by patriarchs while the Female suits of Water and Earth are led by Matriarchs. Aside from the Court Archetypes, many of the characters in The Gnostic Tarot exhibit an unspecified gender, leaving the question of gender open for the Querent.</p>

<p>In 2019, the final painting for The Gnostic Tarot was completed. Throughout 2020, tarot-maker and founder of Welkin Tarot assembled the material for the deck and edited the accompanying notes into the deck's companion book. The result is a 300-page colour trade-paperback packed with invaluable information and insight. Each card is reproduced in the book alongside a simplified version of the card, outlined and coded with letters for easy identification in the text. Each card's explanation is presented in point form, to keep ideas clear and themes bundled in easily accessed groupings. Each exegesis ends with a simplified set of interpretations, single-word definitions for upright and reversed pulls, and relevant quotes from the author, Jung, Gnostics, and scripture.</p>

</ul><p> </p></div>","The Seas of Vodari is a full-color book that we are offering in hardcover and PDF. This book provides 200+ pages of material for gamemasters to run exciting seafaring campaigns for 5th Edition. Your players will get tons of options for creating characters and you'll get support to run a world full of swashbuckling action and magical adventure. We need your support to fund the additional artwork, book layout, and to print the hardcover book.  Long ago, a vast continent was annihilated and all but the outer edge of the continent sank to the bottom of the sea. The devastation left only a scattered few to start rebuilding their civilization on a ring of islands…The Seas of Vodari campaign setting contains all of the iconic things you’d expect in a fantasy setting, but in a world with more water than land, much of the familiar becomes surprising and new. 
Dungeons can be found deep below the surface of the sea in the form of shipwrecks and lost cities.
The most dangerous monsters are found below the waves, such as sea dragons, megalodons and krakens.
Nature becomes as deadly as the most powerful monsters with furious hurricanes, catastrophic tsunamis, and fiery volcanoes.
Islands are modular by nature and the book was designed for you to use as a detailed setting or to pick and choose what you like for your own game world.  The Seas of Vodari campaign setting was created to support seafaring adventures that focus on the crew of a ship hunting sea monsters, exploring mysterious uncharted islands, visiting bustling port cities, following maps to find buried treasure, and battling cutthroat pirates. The setting is also well suited to running campaigns in its large port cities, with swashbuckling heroes getting mixed up with fierce rivals, notorious crime syndicates, feuding nobles, and scheming politicians.  Sceptre, the capital of the Pirate Isles.The Seas of Vodari will provide you with tons of material to run an entire seafaring campaign or just a single adventure...
New races and subraces, classes and subclasses, backgrounds, and feats for your players to create seafaring adventurers.
Swashbuckling and sorcery inspired options for all 12 classes to fit a seafaring world
Gunslinger class with three subclasses (Arcane Gunmaster, Pistolero, and Musketeer) 
A full pantheon for clerics and paladins

New weapon, armor and equipment options to offer your players. 
You'll find flintlock pistols and rifles, cutlasses and sabres, compasses, spyglasses, and more.
New spells, magic items, and powerful ancient relics with a focus on sailing, naval combat, and underwater exploration. Explore countless islands, with details for over thirty islands, a dozen cities, wilderness encounters, ruins, and more.
Advice for running swashbuckling adventures
Rules for duels, social combat, naval chases, plunder tables, the code of the sea, and more.

'Island with No Name' starter adventure for levels 1 to 3. 
Quick run scenarios including a haunted ship, sunken shipwreck, treasure hunt, and more.

Sloops, brigatines, galleons, gnomish submersibles, dwarven ironsides, elven swan ships, ships of the damned, and more. 
Plus, we didn't forget to add lots of cannons.
NPCs for your players to befriend or face as adversaries. Stats, motivations, illustrations, and more will be provided for each. Monsters to challenge, amuse, and terrify your players including sea dragons, windsurfing goblins, sirens, technofish, megalodons, and sea titans.   When the campaign ends we'll send out a survey to all of our backers where you'll have the option to pick-up additional copies of the book and add-ons on Backerkit.  Add-on prices are in Canadian dollars.Our current team on the project.Shawn Ellsworth - Project LeadCo-founder of ENnie nominated Tribality.com, platinum selling author on DriveThruRPG, web designer, and gamemaster sailing the Seas of Vodari since 2014.Brandes Stoddard -  Game Designer & WriterFreelance game designer/writer and fantasy LARPer.

Its narrative (Adventure Mode) uses free and explicit violence to drive the players through the atmosphere, and surround them with all the concepts that trigger disturbance and immorality in human beings. Players will be forced to take part in different events which may cause discomfort to those playing or viewing it.Our objective is NOT to promote this way of thinking. We created this unique universe to show the worst side of human beings.For those who just want a quick, fun, goreless game session, we also offer the Arcade Mode which includes missions for 1 to 6 players and doesn't follow the narrative or need an Overlord. Because Sanctorvm is a narrative adventure, our long-term goal is to bring it to the digital world. Using pixel art style, we will create an application that will act as a storyteller itself, facilitating the Overlord's job. This application will not be required for the gameplay, but it will help!

The idea of Sanctorvm was born during a role-playing session combined with the essence of Sci-Fi movies like Event Horizon, Pandorum, or Alien.Once we had the main story, we went looking for visual references to develop the different factions of the Colony and define the style not just of the different creatures and enemies, but also the whole game pack, trying to mix ideas from Dead Space, Borderlands, or Dark Souls for example.We used Christian references to create a distorted version and develop the Edentronic Order ruled by Savior.Tribal and Mad Max-Cyberpunk references were used to create the Virgul Tum’s Stigia Herd.In order to create the Leviathan Cult, we took the aesthetics of different Satanic cults and combined them with the idea of the cult from Dead Space.For the Scarlet Pantheon and the military world of Didier, we have the Colonel Kurt and his brigade from Apocalypse Now as the idea of an army ruled by a madman.Finally, we have Proteus, a virus inspired by the unleashed power of the movie Akira, growing grotesque organic forms with different powers.These powers are known as Ethermancy and are the representation of magic in this world, so we chose a style closer to Tarot or Sakura - the anime - to create them, using just black and white and a classic composition.To complement the art, we have all the music created by various artists that gives the final touch of colour and spirit, taking the sounds and aesthetics from the retro wave music and giving power to neons and powerful colours.Mixing all of this, we finally have a product that tries to manage a constant duality between order and chaos, organic and inorganic, life and death, to finally fit it all into a box lost in space. We took this project to Indiegogo because we love what we do!

Not to mention the vague instructions that come along with the kits simply serve to increase frustration and prolong the build.At I Built It, we aim to change that!  Our model kits do not need tools, glue or paint to be completed. All the parts snap together using a unique friction fit system that allows you to assemble and disassemble each kit as you please. Our kits come pre-painted using only non-toxic paints. This pre-painted layer also acts as a primer should you wish to paint or whether your model. Standard Texture vs Pro Texture Our models feature working components and mechanisms varying from doors and windows that really open, to drawbridges that lower, and siege engines that launch projectiles!     Our instruction booklets are thorough, detailed, and clearly illustrated with step by step instructions and handy suggestions to make each assembly quick and painless. Most importantly, all our building kits are ""Super-Modular,"" giving you the ability to combine our sets with almost no limit!          Comparative photo showing the Eyrie Rampart on the left (120mm length) and the regular Rampart on the right (100mm length) Super Modularity: Our sets have multiple levels of modularity and are designed to maximize your ability to customize your model as well as expand your collection to build entire villages, towns, and castles.All our sets are made up of individual modular blocks that can be stacked vertically as well as horizontally.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We aren't a wealthy plug &amp; play camp— we built this bar in our early twenties, with our bare hands, sweating profusely, bleeding occasionally, using mostly recycled material and an infantile understanding of carpentry. After many years of hard use, it's falling apart and it's time to rebuild it so we can keep serving this goddamn soup. And we need your help! Please, get involved and be a part of this magical project, and help us keep serving you soup for the rest of your life! We will love you forever. And you will have the pleasure of knowing you supported the playa's best late night hangout spot, which you can flaunt in front of your coworkers! Don't make us beg. We will beg! </p>
<p>Settlers On The Playa is based on the rules of Settlers of Catan, and the game play is similar, but mixes in inspiration from the sights and concepts you'll find on the Playa.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The new bar design is super dope; it's the same sexy vibe you know and love, but it will be sleeker, safer, and more durable. This time, our famous two-story bar is being designed by structural engineers to be safe and long lasting, made from steel.  So we won't have to bother you for money again after this. <br/><br/>And fear not!

We aren't a wealthy plug & play camp— we built this bar in our early twenties, with our bare hands, sweating profusely, bleeding occasionally, using mostly recycled material and an infantile understanding of carpentry. After many years of hard use, it's falling apart and it's time to rebuild it so we can keep serving this goddamn soup. And we need your help! Please, get involved and be a part of this magical project, and help us keep serving you soup for the rest of your life! We will love you forever. And you will have the pleasure of knowing you supported the playa's best late night hangout spot, which you can flaunt in front of your coworkers! Don't make us beg. We will beg! 
Settlers On The Playa is based on the rules of Settlers of Catan, and the game play is similar, but mixes in inspiration from the sights and concepts you'll find on the Playa.
Each early-bird Settlers of the Playa game will include:
 An 18'x18' quad-fold custom board inspired by the Playa

 

60 roads                                                                                    

20 Camps                                                                                      

16 Villages                                                                                        

1 ""Sparkle Pony""                                                                                        

95 resource cards (Flames, Sparkles, Wind, Water, Dust)
25 development cards (14 Ranger, Darkwad, Playa Terraforming, Center Camp, Groundscore & Temple)
4 ""Camp Dues"" cards
2 Special Cards ""Longest Trip"", & ""Largest Camp""
28 number tokens
11 ""Black Rock Desert"" markers
2 dice
1 Rulebook including the names of our early-bird supporters 


The Impact
The new bar design is super dope; it's the same sexy vibe you know and love, but it will be sleeker, safer, and more durable. This time, our famous two-story bar is being designed by structural engineers to be safe and long lasting, made from steel.  So we won't have to bother you for money again after this. And fear not! We will still have a stripper pole!

</div><p> </p><h2>the details matter</h2><ul>
<li><p><strong>minimal cabling</strong> - cables are a necessity on an electric bike, but that doesn't mean they have to be an eyesore. we have discreetly integrated the cabling and used low profile, waterproof connectors to maintain an inconspicuous aesthetic</p></li>
<li><p><strong>clean cockpit</strong> - welcome home. where others add on, we've taken away. ergonomic brake levers, stealthy grips and minimal cabling make for a clean view and intuitive riding experience</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ultra-bright front light</strong> - cast light in the dark. not all areas of a city are well lit, and you don't want to be fighting for visibility. the front light is incredibly bright at 40 lux. like a car headlight it projects a visible beam of light onto the road ahead, and for our friends in Germany, it's STVZO [Straßenverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung] compliant</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ultra-bright rear light</strong> - we all want to be seen. the wide-casting rear light sits neatly beneath the seat. but don't let its size fool you, it's super bright and STVZO compliant</p></li>
<li><p><strong>smooth welds</strong> - we're setting a new standard for aesthetics. the frame welds are smoothed by hand to deliver an incredible finish</p></li>
<li><p><strong>customisable components</strong> - we don't believe in limiting you to proprietary accessories. we use industry-standard sizings and mounting points to allow you to customise your ride exactly to your taste. this includes 'braze-on' mounting points for pannier racks and ring/frame rear wheel locks</p></li>
<li><p><strong>silent electric assist</strong> - it's not just the aesthetic that is inconspicuous. the motor utilises sine wave FOC [frequency oscillation firmware and electronics] to allow you to enjoy your ride in peace</p></li>
<li><p><strong>enhanced waterproofing</strong> - the controller, battery and display are 'potted' using advanced resins and electronic coatings to provide superior protection against the elements</p></li>
<li><p><strong>wheels built to last</strong> - the urban landscape isn't without its obstacles, with potholes and kerbs creating significant forces on the rims when travelling at speed. when we test our bikes, we test them hard, and we made sure to build wheels that can handle everything the urban environment throws your way. combined with the balloon tyres for suspension and comfort, you can ride with complete peace of mind</p></li>
<li><p><strong>optimised assist levels</strong> - if you've been paying close attention you may have noticed that the campaign film states 50km range and the campaign information states 60km - this is because we are continually testing and optimising our firmware and electronics to deliver improved range whilst allowing for maximum support in high assist mode</p></li>
<li><p><strong>packaging</strong> - we are working closely with our supply chain to minimise waste plastics and utilise more recyclable materials in our packaging, ultimately aspiring for an environmental impact that is nothng</p></li>

<p>please note not all industry range estimates are created equal; we've seen e-bikes with the same capacity battery boast anything up to 100km despite being on a heavier bike. we conduct extensive testing in real-world situations with a ranger of riders to ensure our quoted ranges are realistic and replicable. we would like to see more standardised range testing in the ebike industry but until then, we'll depict range as a wide range</p></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'> <strong>what happens if my battery goes flat?</strong></summary><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'>nothng rides normally like a single-speed bike. this is something we love about our compact rear-hub motor; there is no motor resistance when riding without power. combined with the low bike weight, this means that if you get caught out with a flat battery mid-ride you won't need to worry about getting home</summary></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'> <strong>nothng gets wet, then what?</strong> </summary><p>nothng is safe to ride come rain or shine. we're no strangers to inclement weather, so a reliable ebike is essential to keep you moving. the fenders come as standard to shield you from the elements. our motor, battery and all electronics are IPX rated and will handle extreme conditions. in 2020 we had an issue with a 3rd party component that was not holding it's water resistance in all conditions. we quickly replaced this component free of charge for all affected riders and there have been no further issues since then.</p></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'> <strong>what about rust and corrosion?</strong> </summary><p>we have a table of the components that can theoretically rust under extreme conditions. there isn't a metal that is fully corrosion resistant from everything. road salt and sea salt can rust stainless steel for example.

<p>a very good question. nothng weighs 15.9kg, which is super light by ebike standards. this makes nothng easier to lift but also dramatically improves the riding experience. riding nothng even without power is akin to a standard single-speed bike, the same cannot be said for most e-bikes</p>
<p>when you look for the weight of an e-bike it's not often clear what exactly this includes due to varying industry practices. sometimes it includes the battery, sometimes it doesn't. usually the stated weight even excludes the pedals - we've never understood why</p>
<p>we make ours easy to understand. 15.9kg is the weight of the prototype bike with all of its current components (15.814kg to be precise). this is the full e-bike, including pedals and battery, but doesn't include any accessories such as a kickstand or mudguards</p>
<p>as mentioned in the campaign, there will be some differences between the prototype shown in the campaign video and the final production specification. this is down to a combination of factors, such as design improvements implemented by the team, availability of parts in the supply chain, and feedback from our ongoing testing and development trials. we do not anticipate any significant increase or decrease to the final production weight, and would only ever change components if we determine they improve the overall riding experience</p>

<p>it is common practice to collect taxes and duties separately in international crowdfunding campaigns due to the vast array of regulations in place across the globe, and indeed we followed this convention in our last campaign to ensure equal access for all Backers. but we also appreciate this can be more confusing to those less familiar with crowdfunding. this time round we are facing a different world; the pandemic has taken a massive toll on courier networks worldwide and we cannot currently count on reliable shipping options to some areas of the globe. we have therefore taken the difficult decision to limit the campaign to the UK and EU where we can count on more established shipping routes and existing fulfilment partners. the upside of this is that by limiting the shipping options, the regulatory implications are significantly decreased and we can utilise a simpler pledge framework, without the need to collect duties or taxes separately at a later date.</p></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'> <strong>do you provide a warranty?</strong> </summary><p>our technical team are on hand to assist you if you encounter any difficulties. nothng is designed to last</p>

 the details matter
minimal cabling - cables are a necessity on an electric bike, but that doesn't mean they have to be an eyesore. we have discreetly integrated the cabling and used low profile, waterproof connectors to maintain an inconspicuous aesthetic
clean cockpit - welcome home. where others add on, we've taken away. ergonomic brake levers, stealthy grips and minimal cabling make for a clean view and intuitive riding experience
ultra-bright front light - cast light in the dark. not all areas of a city are well lit, and you don't want to be fighting for visibility. the front light is incredibly bright at 40 lux. like a car headlight it projects a visible beam of light onto the road ahead, and for our friends in Germany, it's STVZO [Straßenverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung] compliant
ultra-bright rear light - we all want to be seen. the wide-casting rear light sits neatly beneath the seat. but don't let its size fool you, it's super bright and STVZO compliant
smooth welds - we're setting a new standard for aesthetics. the frame welds are smoothed by hand to deliver an incredible finish
customisable components - we don't believe in limiting you to proprietary accessories. we use industry-standard sizings and mounting points to allow you to customise your ride exactly to your taste. this includes 'braze-on' mounting points for pannier racks and ring/frame rear wheel locks
silent electric assist - it's not just the aesthetic that is inconspicuous. the motor utilises sine wave FOC [frequency oscillation firmware and electronics] to allow you to enjoy your ride in peace
enhanced waterproofing - the controller, battery and display are 'potted' using advanced resins and electronic coatings to provide superior protection against the elements
wheels built to last - the urban landscape isn't without its obstacles, with potholes and kerbs creating significant forces on the rims when travelling at speed. when we test our bikes, we test them hard, and we made sure to build wheels that can handle everything the urban environment throws your way. combined with the balloon tyres for suspension and comfort, you can ride with complete peace of mind
optimised assist levels - if you've been paying close attention you may have noticed that the campaign film states 50km range and the campaign information states 60km - this is because we are continually testing and optimising our firmware and electronics to deliver improved range whilst allowing for maximum support in high assist mode
packaging - we are working closely with our supply chain to minimise waste plastics and utilise more recyclable materials in our packaging, ultimately aspiring for an environmental impact that is nothng

      making nothng happenmanufacturing ebikes is a global business and not for the faint-hearted. dozens of suppliers are required to produce and assemble the wide range of components, from tyres to intricate electronics. to complete a campaign at this scale requires a solid supply chain that can handle the technical and operational complexitieswe have been working with our suppliers and manufactures since 2015, long before the company even officially came into existence, and have built strong working relationships over years of prototyping, factory visits, and during the development and production of our first two campaignsthese strong relationships allow us to navigate the difficulties posed by a world where demand for bikes has never been higher, and where global production has been severely impacted by lockdowns and component shortages. these factors have been a key consideration in the design process, and our partners have been instrumental in working with us to source the readily available, high-quality components that make manufacturing in 2021/22 tenablecoming into our third crowdfunding campaign, we are well-versed in international shipping and have processes and partners in place to ensure smooth progress once bikes roll off the assembly line. our last campaign was fulfilled against the backdrop of a pandemic and the complications and uncertainties caused by the ensuing lockdowns. we faced manufacturing shutdowns, port congestion, rerouted container ships, shipping container shortages & various national lockdowns, but we navigated the challenges and delivered ebikes to our backers despite the circumstancesthis time around we'll be using regional fulfilment centres in the UK & EU to get your ebike to your door. and yes, this also means you have no reason to worry about Brexit. we've thought of everything so you can think of nothng


 designing nothng'simplicity is the ultimate sophistication' Leonardo Da Vincinothng began in summer 2020, right in the middle of a worldwide lockdown. there was nowhere to go, no-one to see and nothing to do. we accepted that, and created nothngour design philosophy is to remove the extraneous, leaving behind only the essential. we place our attention on the elements that define the user experience, considering the material of every bolt, the durability of every cable and the lifespan of every component years into the future. we believe an electric bike is for life, not a throw away piece of consumer electronics.we adopt a modular approach to electric bikes, creating multiple sub-assemblies that can be repaired, replaced and upgraded with ease long into the future. nothing looks like a bike from 50 years ago and in 50 years time bikes will look like nothng our communitysome of you are joining us from our previous campaigns, if so, welcome back! for those of you that are new, welcome to nothng. we are a passionate team with a 20,000 strong community of backers, social media followers, investors and subscribers  nothng is the result of an extensive internal review of who we are and what drives us; to help each and every one of us enjoy the space between places and to create more enjoyable urban landscapes for us all to live inover the last 18 months we have analysed and broken down every aspect of our company and products to their bare components and reflected on the feedback and updates we've received from our thousands of riders. and from this, we rebuilt our focus and processes on solid foundations. we built a company focused on beautiful products, a vision for our cities, and clear communication with our community. we created nothng

meet the teamhi! we're five friends who come together every day to create products that help people love the space between places. products for us, and for you. that's us in the campaign video, and those are our rides. if we look a little serious on camera it's because we're usually on the other side of the lens, but you'll meet our other sides in future episodes show nothngnothng TV is our new communications platform. we are merging all our updates into a single format; video.over time, all manufacturing updates, investor updates and product launches will be featured in episodes on our YouTube channel 


 we will be bringing you closer into the process of building and growing a community, manufacturing hardware and shipping it globally alongside the myriad of other daily operations we're involved in like R&D and customer support. join us on this journey! we invite you to learn, laugh and cry with us please note: we may feature any public comments and support tickets on our TV show nothng is readywhen we fill the streets with nothng they become safer, cleaner and more enjoyable for everyonejoin us on our journey to create a better world. exploring your city should feel like nothngcontact us at support@nothng.com nothng begins, nothng endsnothng is an experience of effortlessness, lightness and peaceif joy is found in the moment then the journey itself is the destinationour mission is to create space where there was none beforeour mission is to create nothng FAQtechnical & features  what is an ebike? how does nothng work? nothng utilises pedal-assist technology to significantly augment rider input to deliver an easier, faster and more enjoyable ride. as you pedal, the discreet rear hub motor delivers a powerful assist that takes the strain out of riding, allowing you to focus on enjoying your journey what makes nothng the 'best' ebike? we want more people riding e-bikes because when our streets are filled with e-bikes they become safer, cleaner and more enjoyable for everyone
in our minds 'best' covers the whole experience; affordable, safe, comfortable, reliable, powerful, beautiful - all factors nothng excels in. this is an ebike that has been meticulously considered and offers an uncompromising riding experience.  how fast is nothng?nothng accelerates considerably faster for the same given effort than a non-electric bike. the motor delivers powerful electric assist as you accelerate and ride
in the UK & EU the speed limit will be set to 15.5mph/25kph in line with EPAC (road legal) standards across the continent. this ensures your nothng is road legal and eligible for any subsidies available in your countries
in the US nothng will be delivered with the 20mph restriction inline with US regulation  is there a benefit to nothng even on a short commute? for sure! nothng puts the level of effort required into your hands with its 5 levels of assist. fancy more of a workout? keep the assist on level 1. woken up on the wrong side of the bed? level 5 will take your worries away. adjust your effort to suit your mood
the lightweight design means nothng can be ridden without power, just like a standard single-speed bike how far can I ride on a single battery charge? nothng goes far. it has a range of 20-60km (12-37 miles). the range you experience is affected by a whole host of real-world factors - for example, combined rider & luggage weight, hills, weather conditions and temperature, and the assist level and effort input by the rider
a range of 60km represents a rider putting in consistent, reasonable effort on standard assist level over mixed terrain. a range of 20km would represent a rider putting in negligible effort, and carrying a heavy load on hilly terrain - this is an extreme scenario and below anything we have seen across our testing
please note not all industry range estimates are created equal; we've seen e-bikes with the same capacity battery boast anything up to 100km despite being on a heavier bike. we conduct extensive testing in real-world situations with a ranger of riders to ensure our quoted ranges are realistic and replicable. we would like to see more standardised range testing in the ebike industry but until then, we'll depict range as a wide range  what happens if my battery goes flat?nothng rides normally like a single-speed bike. this is something we love about our compact rear-hub motor; there is no motor resistance when riding without power. combined with the low bike weight, this means that if you get caught out with a flat battery mid-ride you won't need to worry about getting home  nothng gets wet, then what? nothng is safe to ride come rain or shine. we're no strangers to inclement weather, so a reliable ebike is essential to keep you moving. the fenders come as standard to shield you from the elements. our motor, battery and all electronics are IPX rated and will handle extreme conditions. in 2020 we had an issue with a 3rd party component that was not holding it's water resistance in all conditions. we quickly replaced this component free of charge for all affected riders and there have been no further issues since then.  what about rust and corrosion? we have a table of the components that can theoretically rust under extreme conditions. there isn't a metal that is fully corrosion resistant from everything. road salt and sea salt can rust stainless steel for example. These components are in use across the whole premium bike industry and have been rigorously tested to industry standards  will nothng be suitable for my height? nothng makes your comfortable. it's a tailored riding position that allows you be as focussed or 'heads up' as you like. it's adjustable
nothng is compatible with most body sizes so please check out the Size Guide in the campaign story to confirm  is nothng comfortable to ride? very comfortable. nothng has been designed with the rider in mind. the frame design and adjustable stem allows you to tailor your riding position to your body geometry. the balloon tyres provide grip in wet weather and suspension on uneven surfaces. the air sprung saddle ensures an even distribution of weight to ensure comfort throughout your journey what does nothng weigh? 
a very good question. nothng weighs 15.9kg, which is super light by ebike standards. this makes nothng easier to lift but also dramatically improves the riding experience. riding nothng even without power is akin to a standard single-speed bike, the same cannot be said for most e-bikes
when you look for the weight of an e-bike it's not often clear what exactly this includes due to varying industry practices. sometimes it includes the battery, sometimes it doesn't. usually the stated weight even excludes the pedals - we've never understood why
we make ours easy to understand. 15.9kg is the weight of the prototype bike with all of its current components (15.814kg to be precise). this is the full e-bike, including pedals and battery, but doesn't include any accessories such as a kickstand or mudguards
as mentioned in the campaign, there will be some differences between the prototype shown in the campaign video and the final production specification. this is down to a combination of factors, such as design improvements implemented by the team, availability of parts in the supply chain, and feedback from our ongoing testing and development trials. we do not anticipate any significant increase or decrease to the final production weight, and would only ever change components if we determine they improve the overall riding experience
  does nothng feature integrated lights? yes, the lights are fully integrated with the electronics and are incredibly bright for see-and-be-seen visibility  how about fenders and a kickstand? fenders, integrated lights, and a kickstand are included. nothng is fully equipped for city riding  what cells are in the battery? Samsung/Sanyo/Panasonic/LG. note that the exact model of cell is subject to change according to the supply chain  how much does nothng cost to charge? one of our riders on Reddit has created this table showing that his bike costs around €0.6 per month to charge. you read that right; it's practically nothng  can i lock the battery to the bike?yes, nothng features a lock to secure your battery whilst you travel. we recommend you take the battery with you when you lock up the bike to discourage theft.  how long does it take to charge the battery? the battery charges from empty to full in 3 hours, or from empty to 80% charge in 2 hours. our compact battery is designed to be easily removed from the bike so you can charge in your home, at your desk, anywhere you like. easy  what is belt drive and how does it affect my ride? belt drive is an alternative drive system to a traditional chain that comes with many advantages. belts are oil-free, maintenance-free, last significantly longer than a chain, deliver more consistent drive than a chain system and are near-silent
we introduced belt drive on our last range of e-bikes and the response was remarkably positive. belt drive is a game-changer
we use Gates Carbon Drive, the industry gold standard, to deliver the ultimate experience  what is the nothng motor capable of? nothng features a powerful 250W rear hub motor that delivers smooth assist via internal gearing and an intelligent drive management system. the output adjusts to the riding conditions to ensure consistent power regardless of road surface, conditions or incline. nothng won't let you down shipping & assembly  when will my nothng e-bike be delivered to me? we hope to get backers their nothng e-bikes in Spring 2021.
between then and now there is much to do; manufacturing components, assembling and packing the e-bikes, shipping them to our fulfilment centres in the UK, EU and US, and finally delivering them to your door. see the timeline in the campaign for more detail. due to the number of stages involved, we cannot guarantee a delivery date, rather we dedicate our efforts to ensuring nothng reaches you as soon as we are confident it will exceed your expectations.
our previous campaign (AMX) was delivered later than anticipated. Most backers received their AMXs within a few months of their estimate, some waited longer. the unfolding pandemic played a large part in this, but it also highlighted room for improvement for us. We have changed a lot since then. this campaign, we have kicked off manufacturing discussions sooner, have new processes in place, and are hitting the ground running.  how is nothng delivered? nothng is delivered '85% assembled' and can be ready to ride in 10-30 minutes. no technical expertise or toolkit required; everything you need is included in the box and the digital assembly guide steers you through the final steps  where does nothng ship to? nothng is available to all Backers throughout the UK, EU, Norway & Switzerland we hope to offer nothng to everyone as we continue to grow so if we can't ship to you yet, be sure to subscribe and keep in touch!  where will nothng be shipped from and are taxes and duties included? nothng will be assembled in China and shipped by ocean freight via our regional fulfilment centres in the UK and EU once your nothng leaves the regional fulfilment centre you will receive a tracking number from the courier to monitor delivery to your door
your pledge covers all duties to bring your ebike into your region (UK or EU), and for the UK, EU, Norwegian & Swiss Backers your pledge includes VAT  in your last campaign taxes and duties were collected separately ahead of shipping, but this time the pledge levels include all of this? that's correct - the pledge levels include VAT where relevant and all duties required to import your nothng to your region. the pledge level you see covers all of this
it is common practice to collect taxes and duties separately in international crowdfunding campaigns due to the vast array of regulations in place across the globe, and indeed we followed this convention in our last campaign to ensure equal access for all Backers. but we also appreciate this can be more confusing to those less familiar with crowdfunding. this time round we are facing a different world; the pandemic has taken a massive toll on courier networks worldwide and we cannot currently count on reliable shipping options to some areas of the globe. we have therefore taken the difficult decision to limit the campaign to the UK and EU where we can count on more established shipping routes and existing fulfilment partners. the upside of this is that by limiting the shipping options, the regulatory implications are significantly decreased and we can utilise a simpler pledge framework, without the need to collect duties or taxes separately at a later date.  do you provide a warranty? our technical team are on hand to assist you if you encounter any difficulties. nothng is designed to last

5 year frame and fork warranty
2 year warranty all other non-consumables components
1 year battery warranty
  should I be concerned about the effects of Brexit? absolutely not. we are using local regional fulfilment centres, nothng will only be dispatched from the UK for UK Backers. for EU Backers, your nothng will not touch the UK Pledging & Indiegogo  what is Indiegogo? how come you are hosting your campaign on Indiegogo? Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform that unites creators such as ourselves, with Backers such as you, to bring amazing ideas to life. we have previously used Indiegogo to launch our AM1 & AMX range of ebikes; working with our Backer community to make great products and share in the joy of riding them
by pledging your support to nothng we can meticulously perfect the design, thoroughly test and finalise the production specification so we can kick off manufacturing and shipping. as a thank you for your support you can select a perk via the campaign page, so you come away with your very own nothng whilst getting a front row seat to the project. join us on this journey!  I've heard pledging does not guarantee a perk - is this true? Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform that supports a vast array of projects. as they do not perform the campaign they can take no liability for guaranteeing the project will be completed to that you will receive a perk - for this reason they use a disclaimer to protect themselves from liability
by backing the project, you are choosing to support nothng change the way we move through cities and to develop and deliver nothng to every single Backer. this is our third crowdfunding campaign; so you can trust that we have the experience and skillset to make this a reality. our last campaign was delivered against the backdrop of Brexit and a global pandemic, and we did it. we are ready  when I back the campaign, will you provide an Invoice? at the time of your pledge you will receive a confirmation from Indiegogo to acknowledge your contribution and the perks you have selected to receive
you will receive an invoice from Analog Motion ahead of delivery which can be used for insurance purposes or for any subsidies you are eligible for  what happens if I change my address before delivery? no problem at all - you can edit your address via Indiegogo. Ahead of shipping we'll give you a final heads up before we lock in addresses so you can ensure your details are up-to-date  where can I find updates as the project unfolds? we'll be keeping Backers updated with Updates via Indiegogo, as well as video updates on our channel where we will share progress and address any queries you may have about the e-bike or how the project comes together  is my pledge refundable? please check Indiegogo's terms and conditions to determine if you are eligible for a refund via Indiegogo. refunds are available via Indiegogo whilst the campaign is live and for a 10-day window following a pledge via Indiegogo Indemand
refunds are not possible outside of the Indiegogo refund windows as all pledge details and funds are allocated immediately to ensure the project moves forward as efficiently as possible. In other words, your money will be spent and thus it will not be available to you in a cash form. instead you will receive nothng in a physical form Compliance  is nothng road legal? absolutely! nothng is compliant to EN-15194 and is road legal across the UK and EU. the EN-15194 certificate will be available ahead of delivery for Backers who require this  are the lights STVZO compliant? yes, the lights are STVZO compliant and fully integrated  is nothng eligible for e-bike subsidies in my country? nothng is EN-15194 compliant and conforms to all major international standards so benefits from the financial support & incentives available in many countries. please check your local regulations to confirm the requirements. the EN15194 certificate will be available ahead of delivery  do I need insurance or a licence? nothng is an EN15194-compliant pedal-assist ebike that conforms to all major international standards, and as such does not require a registration plate, insurance or licence. if you would like to guarantee road legality please check your local regulations  does each nothng have a unique serial number?yes. this is stamped into the frame and is shown on your box when it arrives at your door video  will i receive nothng from the film?nothng you see in the campaign video are prototypes and represent the current status of the project. these are real, working e-bikes designed by our team and built with our existing supply chain, not concepts we have yet to determine feasibility for  are you done with everything or are you developing nothng? nothng; our design team continues to press each iteration through intense scrutiny to perfect the design. the production specification you receive will benefit from all the advancements through this process. you will receive a better ebike than you see in the video  why does the [step] style look different in the video? the step frame you see in the video is a prototype based on an early frame design. we have since made a major frame revision involving a straight top tube that delivers significant advantages; accommodating a greater rider height range, making it easier to insert and remove the battery, and delivering an incredible look  why is no one is wearing helmets in the video? the riding you see in the video is not indicative of our real-world cycling practices. on location, the film crew are monitoring the location to ensure it is clear and safe. the bike is then ridden over short distances to get the shot
we recommend everyone always wear a suitable and well-fitted helmet when riding a bike or e-bike. failure to do so could result in a greater risk of injury during an accident  who are the riders in the video? us. we are nothng. we are passionate about the products we create and the way these improve our cities and enhance our lifestyles. welcome to our way of riding the company  how do i pronounce nothng? noth-ing or noth-en are both correct. there is no Nike or Nikee separation here. whatever sounds good for you is good for us.  why do you not use capitals? there are a few reasons for this. the first is that we don't believe in beginnings and ends, instead we believe in process and movement, that everything is always in motion, and for that reason our sentences are continuations of something that came before, that will continue after, it's a nod to the infinite. the second reason is that we want our use of capitals to be highly intentional and to stand out, one example of this is our use of capitals for names. we will always use a capital B for our Backers out of respect. this is our 4th crowdfunding campaign and we would not be here without you, our Backers. sometimes auto-correct 'fixes' our style which can be inconsistent, let us know if this happens and we will correct it. we're human after all. FYI the rule is that we never use capitals unless it's a name  who are you?we don't really know, but we are on a journey to figure it out. you'll find out with us too. make sure you subscribe  can i invest in nothng?if you wish to invest growth capital in nothng and own equity please apply using the form below and the founders will respond to every enquiry made with next steps if applicable.",37.0,0,"3 Campaigns

The Arclight Pedals amplify your biological motion making you up to 57% more visible than standard bike lights. Powerful LEDs and long lasting rechargeable batteries ensure you will stand out and stay safe even on your longest ride.  The unmistakable circular movement of the Arclight Pedals attracts the attention of motorists and pedestrians - instantly identifying you as a cyclist. Scientific studies performed by Clemson University and others show that adding bio-motion (motion that is associated with the natural movement of the human body) increases visibility by up to 57% compared to standard front/rear lights.Standard bike lights are often difficult to distinguish from car lights, traffic lights, and building lights. The dynamic motion of the Arclight Pedals creates a unique visual signature, cutting through the visual clutter to maximize visibility and safety. Standard bike lights are typically visible only from directly behind or in front of the bicycle; with limited visibility from the sides. The wraparound design of the Arclight LED modules illuminates every angle - providing 360° of protection. The lights also cast a unique glowing pattern on the ground as you pedal, creating a large light “footprint” that is uniquely noticeable from all directions. Arclight’s SmartSet sensors turn the lights on automatically when you start riding, and turn off automatically when you park your bike. They’re on when you need them and off when you don’t. The Arclight Pedals are packed with SmartSet sensors that dynamically change the LED color depending on orientation so you always have white forward and red rear.    The Arclight Modules have a built-in USB plug, so you can charge the Light Module with any standard USB charger, or charge all 4 together using the included hub.  The Pedals are made from rugged aluminum alloy and employ the same sealed bearings used in high end MTB pedals. The Light Modules have been engineered to work reliably in all conditions. Wherever and whenever you ride, the Arclight Pedals won’t hold you back. 



 

How does the color-switch work?



 

If you want even more visibility, or need to quickly add lights to a bike without Arclight Pedals, the Multi-Mount allows you to attach the Light Modules to any bike in seconds; no tools needed.The Light Modules easily slide into the Multi-Mount with the same rock-solid magnetic locking attachment as the pedals. Depending on the mount location, SmartSet technology automatically selects the correct colors for front and rear. Arclight Pedals are compatible with almost any bicycle. Just unscrew your current pedals, screw on the Arclight Pedals, slide in the light modules, and you’re ready to ride! 

 
Do you have clipless pedals? We are working on a solution for you - click here to learn more and add your cleat type and pedal make to the list. Shipping and Taxes (or VAT, if applicable) will be separately charged when we are ready to ship your reward. You'll be able to pay these costs through BackerKit, a post-campaign order management tool.Due to unusually high shipping costs caused by global supply chain issues, we will be charging shipping just prior to fulfillment, in the hopes that costs will decrease. The table below represents our best estimate of shipping costs.Customers based in the US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia will be charged for VAT or other applicable taxes (via BackerKit) when we are ready to ship your reward.Customers based in all other countries will be responsible for any import duties, taxes and customs fees after the shipment arrives in their country.   Redshift was born on crowdfunding. 8 years ago, the crowdfunding community helped us turn a product idea into a company. We launched our first campaign in 2013 and we were blown away by the response. Fast forward a few years and we have 3 successful campaigns under our belt (Switch Aero System, ShockStop Stem, and ShockStop Seatpost). We are lucky to have some of the best supporters around, and because of the crowdfunding community's support, we have been able to pursue our passion for designing and building the highest quality bike components.Since our first crowdfunding campaign, we’ve grown a lot as a company. We have several product lines, an amazing group of customers, an established supply chain and manufacturing partners, and worldwide distribution! But, at our core, we’re still a small dedicated group passionate about making products that solve real problems for real cyclists.  We still design, engineer, test, assemble, and package all of our products in our Philadelphia workspace. We will always strive to make unique, impactful products while maintaining our high standards of quality and customer service. This isn’t our first crowdfunding rodeo. At Redshift, we’ve been designing and manufacturing complex bicycle components for the last 8 years. We have strong existing relationships with key suppliers and manufacturers, and we know (from first-hand experience) the technical risks and challenges of taking an idea and turning it into a real product.The transition from a prototype (even a really good prototype) to a finished, manufactured product is a huge leap - one that many crowdfunding creators underestimate (ourselves included in past Kickstarter/Indiegogo campaigns). With the Arclight Pedals we decided to do things differently. We completed the transition from prototype to manufacturing before launching the campaign, knowing that this would reduce risks and enable us to start fulfilling backer rewards as quickly as possible. There are so many variables these days affecting worldwide supply chains and logistics, so reducing the uncertainty associated with these variables is critical.  We’ve been working hand-in-hand with our manufacturing partners for the past year to prepare the Arclight Pedals for manufacturing. Production tooling for both the pedals and light modules is complete, and we’ve been riding and testing production samples for several months. Last month we officially issued the purchase orders to the factories for the first production run.  Obviously,  we won’t know exactly what quantity is needed until the campaign concludes, but we think it’s worth moving forward at-risk so we can ultimately get the Arclight Pedals into your hands as quickly as possible.

In 2016, Alec rejected a dream job offer at Shimano, and co-founded Beno Technologies with the goal of pioneering e-bike innovation and creating the perfect e-bike for the modern urban cyclist. Reevo is the result of that dream - an innovative hubless e-bike brought to life by a team of experienced engineers and manufacturing specialists. Alec has previously worked at a Fortune 500 company as a senior mechanical design engineer. His expertise and experience led to the creation of the first hubless wheel prototype based on an innovative novel design. When he’s not busy designing bikes, Alec can be found riding them and keeping up to date with the latest in the biking world. He also enjoys modifying Harley Davidsons and has a slightly unhealthy obsession with devising new destructive tests for bikes. Ivan, Ph.D. (CTO)Ivan’s love of technology started early from a young age. He was always fascinated by the latest gadgets and dreamt that one day, he could invent something just as cool. That passion led him to join Beno Technologies to work on novel e-bike technologies. Prior to this, Ivan has accumulated research and manufacturing experience in various world-renowned companies, notably in the semiconductor industry. He also holds a degree and doctorate in Electrical Engineering, and has authored several research papers in the field of IoT and smart lighting.He loves building over-engineered gadgets to simplify mundane tasks and has a particular weakness for the latest gadgets in the tech world. Ivan is also an avid soccer fan, and tunes in to watch his beloved Liverpool F.C. at every opportunity. Andrea (Lead Engineer)Andrea is a leading expert in ASIC, PCBA and FPGA design, with over 20 years of experience in various engineering-related fields. He is also the founder of KERR Srl, an R&D company with a strong focus on ASIC, electronic and custom software development. His wealth of expertise also extends to product design and manufacturing prepardness. Andrea led work on the signature Triple Barrier AntiTheft system, overall system engineering design, and quality testing.He can often be found exploring new hiking trails and taking his various bikes out for a ride on beautiful sunny days.

<p>STRØM Bikes is the brainchild of entrepreneur Nichlas Lloyd (age 29).<br/>Nichlas is in charge of industrial design and production spending more than 3+ years in factories all over Asia designing unique components for our lights, frames and all the way down to our custom screw wires connecting our e-bike system.. <br/> </p>
<p>STRØM Bikes started in November 2016 when we designed our first FATBIKE model, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/strom-bike-the-perfect-e-bike-for-any-ride/x/16057157#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">which later raised more than $450,000 here on Indiegogo </a>out of a campaign goal of $40,000.<br/><br/>We then experienced a high demand for a city bike. The City bike was launched in <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/strom-city-a-feature-packed-and-affordable-e-bike/x/16057157?create_edit=true#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>2018 rasing more than $2.050.000 million here on Indiegogo</u></a> with the increased goal of $50.000.</p>

This lighting system makes your rides safer and more convenient with brake lights and multi blinking functions. Say goodbye to lost or stolen bike lights and hello to peace-of-mind commuting.

The mini front motor is built to be durable, powerful, and silent. Choose between a 250W (EU model 25kmh/15mph) or 350W (US model 32 kmh/20mph) motor.

 

DisplaysSTRØM CITY comes with an LED display that allows you to adjust to 6 different assist levels (1-5) and shows the battery level. It also features a fully integrated USB charging system, so you can charge your mobile device on-the-go. Or you can upgrade to our intelligent computer display, which shows battery level, assist level, distance, trip meter, speed in km/h or mph, and more. And of course, the computer display also has a fully integrated mobile device charging system.
 



Automatic drive functionThe automatic drive function (turbo throttle) allows you to ride fully electric without using the pedal assist. Please note that this function is only available on our US version, as current legislation does not permit the throttle function in most European countries.


Shimano Nexus - 3 SpeedSTRØM CITY W Works like a regular bike and comes with a single-handed 3-speed Shimano inner-gear system that lets you use it just like a regular bike. This is what we call the “exercise level” (0 assist from the motor). Very useful if you want to exercise or if your battery runs out of juice.


Plug and play wiresWe have an innovative screw wire system that will make you able to switch our component quickly. The system is IP68 waterproof. A smart system for remote repairs and new accessories.   


Puncture-proof tiresThere is nothing more discouraging while out biking than hearing that distinctive hiss from a tire. Say goodbye to flat tires and hello to STRØM CITY W’s puncture-proof tires.


Hand-stiched gripsWe only use the best high-quality hand-stitched grips. More importantly, we have installed grips that are very ergonomic for hands and wrist. The wide surfaces add to the pleasure of your daily commutes. 


Ergonomic saddleA well-shaped saddle matching your grips. The ergonomic wide shape makes you sit most comfortably. We have also added a convenient handle in the back excellent for parking the bike. 


Rust-free componentsThe component has been carefully selected to ensure your e-bike will last for years. It is built to be as rust-free as possible – from top to bottom. We’ve even added a chain protector to keep mud and dirt out of your chain. Less cleaning, more biking!

STRØM Bikes is the brainchild of entrepreneur Nichlas Lloyd (age 29).Nichlas is in charge of industrial design and production spending more than 3+ years in factories all over Asia designing unique components for our lights, frames and all the way down to our custom screw wires connecting our e-bike system..  
STRØM Bikes started in November 2016 when we designed our first FATBIKE model, which later raised more than $450,000 here on Indiegogo out of a campaign goal of $40,000.We then experienced a high demand for a city bike. The City bike was launched in 2018 rasing more than $2.050.000 million here on Indiegogo with the increased goal of $50.000.
 

 
WHAT A RIDE we have been through as a relatively young company with amazing experiences and the darkest of days! We have struggled, we have been challenged, we have fought to the extreme - but most importantly we have learned a lot from all of it!
 

 
'Thank you to the whole team and most importantly the people that have backed our mission in making inner-city commuting more sustainable and convenient' ⚡️

The versatile and playful features completely fit the goal we peruse to be embodied on our E-Scooter that can be practical and recreation-oriented for users. The most distinctive part lies in its changeable casings that can be freely mixed and match to make the look colorful and unique. From the stem, riding positions, tires to the casings, these are the parts that can be changed to add various tastes and styles to your ride.</p>

Our CGO 600 is the ultimate solution for urban commuting.  Commutes should be fun. So we are here.


We found the most suitable power solution to match with a Gates CDX carbon belt drive. The motor, sensor, and controller are made just for each other, for max compatibility and performance.
 

With the high accuracy torque sensor, no ride will be too hard, no slope will be too steep. Unlike conventional metal chains, the Gates carbon belt will not suffer from metal fatigue. It is care-free for 30000km, and will “unchain” you from mechanical noises or oily hands. Thanks to our aero aluminium alloy frame, the full weight is only 15 kg, which is 40% lighter than the industry average of 25 kg. After around 2.5 hours of charging, you can ride up to 130 km. If your daily commute is around 10km, one-time full charge means 7 days of riding*.*This result was obtained from road test and mathematical model. For your riding life, we want 100% fun and 0% trouble.When you are required to push your bike, you won't need to spend the effort. Push and hold the “Down” button under the display, and your CGO 600 will enter walking-assistance mode.  High quality reflective stripes help you to shine safely in the night. Extra styles, for the extra-ordinary you.Combining 20 years of bike expertise with the passionate idealism of young cyclists, we formed Tenways in 2019. Dissatisfied with what the eBike industry is routinely producing, we designed the CGO600 to make daily commutes the carbon-less fun they should be.",54.0,7,"1 Campaign

Some financial, operational, and challenges within ones organization; all of which are unforeseen. The key to succeeding is through perseverance and thinking outside of the box.Though ICH is not a new company starting our company in 2015, there are many good things about where we are and not being a brand new company; such as:
We've already gone through the big hurdles of a new organization in finding the right talent and colleagues to see this product through to the end.
We've dealt with development companies who's business to business ethics are not where they should be.
We've navigated through to the right developmental partnerships needed to take the iC-R from concept, to production, and into all rider's hands.
 ICH has endured most of the challenges that cause start-up company's to give up and close down. Since our inception, we have minimized any future risks by:
Ensuring our core team is solid and has the proper credentials and expertise to get the job done.
Critically thought through every part of the design of the iC-R, its features, and affordable pricing so that all can be safe while riding.
Aligning ourselves with the proper developmental and manufacturing partnerships to help produce the right product, and on time.
 Realistically, no one can predict every possible issue that may arise within a development such as this. What we have learned through years of experience is to plan and prepare for the worst possible issues; which is what we have done.

<h3><strong>READY FOR EVERY ADVENTURE</strong></h3>
<p>As mom to a 2-year-old, I want my child to go everywhere with me and enjoy new experiences. And, I know what a challenge it can be to get out and about with your kids.</p>
<p>Toddlers often aren't interested in riding in a stroller anymore, yet want to be carried when those little legs get tired. Throw in your bag with all the snacks, diapers, sippy cups, blankets, etc. and it's not long before Mom &amp; Dad are experiencing back problems. </p>
<p>Having spent 7 years in the juvenile products' industry before having a baby myself, I knew that we could build a better wagon stroller that would look great, be super functional, and come with all the ""extras"" included.  So we brought together talented industrial designers, engineers, and product researchers, and an incredible manufacturing team to create our new Anthem™ All-Terrain Wagon Strollers.</p>

Plus, the insane 100-mile range and zippy acceleration of 0-30 in 4 seconds put a smile on your face every ride.CyberX by Xion doesn’t blend in or look like a practical eBike—the world has enough of those. There are hundreds of eBikes on the market and choosing the right one for you is more challenging than ever, so we’ll make this simple.We designed CyberX with 3 things in mind: quality, performance, and style.It’s made from the most durable materials for maximum use and zero maintenance. It has the most efficient brakes and motor, plus high-visibility lighting. And it was born to stand out with next-gen-inspired aesthetics, plus personal touches from you.We can put any pattern or write any name on CyberX’s laser-printed acrylic side panels.Choose from our edgy pre-selected pattern options or customize the LED side panels to your unique style by using our Customizer Template.You also get to customize 3 colors on your bike: the frame, seat, and panel. Mirror acrylic panels with LED lights will be a featured add-on during check-out.CyberX’s incredible range is due to the powerful 72V battery and highly-efficient 750-watt Mid-Drive Motor. When riding solo, go up to 75 miles at 20mph with no pedaling, or cover 100 miles with pedal assist. If you’re maxing out the throttle, expect up to 50 miles.Hop on, twist the throttle and you can’t help but smile. This bike is so fun to ride.Accelerate from 0-30mph in 4 seconds and be on your way!Instead of using the standard chain drive that clunks, needs grease or snaps altogether, we upgraded the motor to belt-drive for reliability, the smoothest rides and zero maintenance.No clutch, no gear box = no maintenance. Just wipe’r down after a dusty ride.eBikes on the market have one of two types of motors: hub-drive or mid-drive. Cyber X uses an extreme, 750W mid-drive motor for its enhanced performance, low-maintenance and better handling due to the low, central position on the bike. You’ll enjoy heart-accelerating power on a dirt track, reliable speed & traction going uphill, and maintenance-free riding.Most eBikes don’t have the seat room or the power for 2 people to ride comfortably, but CyberX has both.The extra long, vinyl seat ensures your friend or partner can enjoy the ride as well!Most eBikes on the market use 36v or 48v batteries—we knew right away that wouldn’t be enough for CyberX. CyberX uses a hefty 72 volt 32ah lithium-ion battery that charges in 6 hours with the included 5 amp charger. *10amp charger with 3-hour charge time available for upgrade.*The removable battery is located under the seat of the bike with a side port for charging. Plug the charger into a 110-120v wall outlet (regular AC outlet) and it’ll power your bike for 50-100 miles depending on which mode you use!CyberX by Xion makes easy work of even the roughest terrains.It has enough power to let you rip up the sandpit with your dirt biking friends, hit the trails with mountain bikers or cruise across the city.It doesn’t matter if you’ve been riding dirt bikes, eBikes and motorcycles all your life, or if this is your first time on an electric bike, Cyber X will blow your hair back and give you the ride of a lifetime!Ride hard and brake with ease. You can count on CyberX’s front and rear hydraulic brake system to give you a smooth stop with just a finger.Enjoy the smoothest ride with front and rear suspension, plus comfort and support on off-road adventures.At 165lbs (75kg) with 500lbs carrying capacity, there’s no need to “take it easy” on CyberX.eBike frames are typically made of one of 3 materials: alloy, carbon or steel. Alloy and carbon are the lightest materials and they tend to be used on eBikes mimicking bicycles and aiming for maximum portability.CyberX's frame is made of steel and 4130 Chromoly steel because it’s the absolute toughest material and will withstand the hardest rides. Plus, it has powder coating (the most durable option) that resists weather and corrosion.The tire size is based on which size CyberX eBike you choose.You’ll enjoy maximum visibility with front and rear LED lights and a futuristic look like no other bike with color-changing LED lights on the custom side panels.Mirror acrylic panels with LED lights will be a featured add-on during check-out.Wearing headphones while riding is dangerous—plus, no one can sing along. CyberX makes your joyride complete with a waterproof Bluetooth speaker for easy listening and maximum awareness of your surroundings.Snap your phone in and charge it on the go.Dirt bikes require constant maintenance and there’s a learning curve if you don’t already know how to ride a motorcycle with a clutch and gears.CyberX has no clutch, no gears and no maintenance—but you can still have a great time tearing through the dirt. It’s the perfect low-maintenance alternative to a dirt bike or a great introduction to high speed for inexperienced riders.Mountain bike trails are reserved for bicycles only, but they’re some of the most exhilarating paths to ride with some extra power. CyberX’s electric bicycle classification means it’s allowed on mountain bike trails so you get the best of both worlds!No license? No problem! CyberX requires no license because in Street Mode, it’s restricted to 28mph. However, your CyberX comes with certification of origin, including VIN, product, model and year if you need to register it as a moped in your state.You can count on CyberX to get you where you need to go whether it’s work, school or a late-night party! The bike’s comfortable 2-person seat, 100-mile range and one-of-a-kind lighting make it a pleasure to ride every time.Rideshare services are expensive and contribute to the carbon emissions damaging our planet. Plus, you have to come in contact with a complete stranger.With CyberX there’s no more waiting or paying for each ride, you just twist the throttle and go!Every bike is designed and manufactured here in the USA by us, the team at Xion Bike. We have 20 years of experience creating high-performance eBikes in San Diego. You can even stop by our shop if you’re local—it’s pretty cool!Our core purpose at Xion Bike is to make the most innovative eBikes that help reverse climate change by promoting sustainability and micro-mobility. Our zero-emission eBikes make eco-friendly transportation available for not one, but 2 people, all while creating an unforgettable experience.Thank you for backing XION CyberX eBike! Wish to upgrade your bike?

<div>For the last ten years the LITELOK team have been obsessed about designing better ways to secure your bike when you need to leave it.  We've travelled the world photographing thousands of locked bikes and talking to hundreds of riders. Consistently everyone talks about how much they love to ride and how devastated they would be if their bike was stolen.  Since launching our first Kickstarter campaign in 2015, we've protected over 50,000 bikes but we're always looking to build better locks and we think we've created our most secure lock to date.</div>

Industry experts recommend using independently accredited, high quality locks for insurance cover as well as peace of mind but most conventional, high security locks are heavy, cumbersome and weigh you down.The rise of e-bikes has been phenomenal with the benefits of battery assistance: freedom to cycle further, a welcome boost to get you up the hills or an effortless commute to and from work - we love them but so do bike thieves. Compared with a traditional bike, an e-bike is generally bigger and heavier due to its weighty battery and larger frame size. You’re therefore going to want a longer and flexible lock to secure round your frame, wheel and a fixed object more easily than perhaps you think. And whilst your e-bike weighs more, minimising additional weight by carrying a lighter lock will mean a longer battery life to ride further and home again.Many cyclists carry their locks inside their frame but with an e-bike this may not always be possible due to the battery and frame design. A wearable option is a useful solution if you don’t want to mount or carry your lock in a bag.LITELOK CORE is designed and built to protect bikes and e-bikes in any environment: light, flexible, wearable (if you want to) and Certified by Sold Secure to the highest rating of Bicycle Diamond, a new security level, created with higher value bikes and e-bikes in mind.Designed with multiple layers of protection from the inner core out, LITELOK CORE is flexible and tough enough to keep your ride safe. It is comprised of two key components: Boaflexicore Plus and a hardened steel inline lock body.Boaflexicore Plus - graphical representationBoaflexicore Plus is a 24mm (15/16”) layered, flexible security strap. From the outside in; the braided sleeve provides abrasion resistance. Next a bonded plant based polymer provides the first line of defence whilst offering corrosion resistance and weatherproofing. In the third layer, 19mm (¾”) interlocking hardened steel links of the exoskeleton absorb destructive energy during attack whilst encasing the high tensile steel core. All layers flex in sync to retain maximum flexibility without compromising on security.Steel inline lock body is made from aerospace grade hardened steel. Inside, an intelligent stainless steel structure resists impact from attack including -40 deg C freeze spray and hammer/chisel blows. At the heart of the product is a pick resistant disc detainer lock, tested to 5,000 open and close locking cycles.The Boaflexicore Plus is joined to the lock body with four marine grade stainless steel rivets to withstand drilling and torsion attacks. LITELOK CORE is one of the lightest and highest grade security locks on the market.LITELOK CORE is easy to secure around a wide range of fixed objects such as tree trunks, posts, fencing and bike stands giving you the flexibility to park your ride wherever you like. It also cinches (coils) into a small size to conveniently stow away. Available in three colours; Blaze Orange and Boa Green for visibility and safety, plus Crow Black for understated style and security.LITELOK CORE BIKE WEARABLE can be effortlessly worn whilst riding and is available in 3 sizes.  Wrap your LITELOK around your hips and secure it with the integrated lock stopper designed to allow you to safely fasten around your body without it locking.Mountable using quick release, friction-free, rattle-free frame mounts.LITELOK CORE is mountable, making it easy to carry whilst riding without the noisy rattle.

Not only it affixes neatly and securely to almost every vehicle dash, but also makes using the device hassle-free. </p><p><strong>Flexible flaps follow the dash curves</strong></p><p>From our previous experience we know how important it is to mount the device firmly on the dash. In our earlier devices, we tried to achieve it with selecting a very flexible base material that would adjust to the curves, but that was not sufficient for some very curvy dashes. In HUDWAY Drive, we've built a mount that consists of more components — base and sectional flaps. Such construction allows for better flexibility and closer adhesion. </p><p>Provided that it's affixed firmly, the mount absorbs dash vibration — so that it doesn't interfere with viewing the projected information, which used to be an issue reported by some of the customers of our earlier devices.</p><p>As for adhesive on the base of the mount — as usual, it's very strong and will keep the device in place on all sorts of dash surfaces, except for suede-like ones. And it leaves no traces when removed.</p><p><strong>The cables run straight to the mount not to the device</strong> </p><p>This means, you only need to deal with wires once, when you first install HUDWAY Drive. After you install the device, plug the cable in the mount power port, secure the cable with dash clips, hide it between the dash and the windshield, then thread it behind the driver's seat to further plug it in the cigarette lighter receptacle. So, whenever you need to use the device, just plug the cable in the cigarette lighter receptacle, and it will power on automatically.</p><p>Same is true for connecting the cameras — the video input port is located on the mount.</p><p><strong>Slide-in mechanism to easily dismount the device</strong></p><p>There may be situations, when you want to drive without the device on the dash, or remove it when parking the car — or you may want to use it on your other vehicle (there will be extra mounts available for purchase later). Anyway, the slide-in mechanism makes removing the device and placing it back very quick and simple. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553607797/u6zrff3mwqwudqbhxs5b.png"" src=""""/></p><p>By now, we have manufactured a small test batch and took the device to a range of vehicles to see how it would fit in the most popular models — and on some of the most challenging dashboards.

This time we're using a different way to do the mirroring — and not relying on AirPlay or Miracast.

And — it now fits in the vehicles where there’s very little space between the dash and the windshield (like in some BMW models).</p><p>The lens is now also smaller and flatter, of a much better quality and with more advanced coatings — thus, <strong>the projection will not be blurry or distorted</strong>.</p><h3>Convenient mounting</h3><p>HUDWAY Drive affixes to the mount using a slide-in lock, and the <strong>power cable plugs in the mount</strong> not in the device, which is why it’s now easier to take the device off and place it back.</p><p>The mount also <strong>absorbs vehicle vibration</strong> which was the issue reported by some of HUDWAY Cast users.</p><h3>Video input</h3><p>For those using additional cameras in their vehicles, HUDWAY Drive offers a video input port (CVBS) which was impossible with HUDWAY Cast.</p><h3>Reliable software</h3><p>By default, HUDWAY Drive uses navigation and routes provided by MapBox.

And it's the most affordable as well.HUDWAY Drive is serving the modern driver, someone on the go who needs to stay connected without sacrificing their safety or the safety of others, with something that can't be found anywhere else.It's for those looking to upgrade the vehicles they already own with a heads-up display — at a fraction of the price charged for built-in OEM solutions, and with a more advanced functionality.It's for the daily commuter, the traveler on the move, the mothers and fathers. It's for drivers everyday, everywhere.Search for places in the app and navigate there with concise directions floating in front of your eyes. Follow timely voice hints on upcoming manoeuvres. Powered by MapBox.See when someone is calling you and accept the call the way you normally do. If you have a Voice Assistant button on the steering wheel, a Bluetooth headset, or Apple Watch, you can connect it to your phone and respond to calls this way. Otherwise, you will need to pick up your phone.View messages and other notifications from your phone projected through your windshield — it’s automated, no extra actions are needed. Preset what you want to see on the head-up display and leave out all the rest.Customize your driving experience with the dashboard widgets:  pitching and rolling, GPS speedometer, clock, weather, ETA, compass, eco driving index, and more.Listen to the voice directions played on your smartphone, Bluetooth headphones, or car media system — and receive phone calls hands-free.One of the most exciting things about an aftermarket heads-up display is its portability. You purchase one, and can take it from one vehicle to another. And this calls for a versatile design that would look good on any vehicle dashboard, as well as for a thought-out mounting system.The HUDWAY Drive mount is one of our favorite innovations. Not only it affixes neatly and securely to almost every vehicle dash, but also makes using the device hassle-free. Flexible flaps follow the dash curvesFrom our previous experience we know how important it is to mount the device firmly on the dash. In our earlier devices, we tried to achieve it with selecting a very flexible base material that would adjust to the curves, but that was not sufficient for some very curvy dashes. In HUDWAY Drive, we've built a mount that consists of more components — base and sectional flaps. Such construction allows for better flexibility and closer adhesion. Provided that it's affixed firmly, the mount absorbs dash vibration — so that it doesn't interfere with viewing the projected information, which used to be an issue reported by some of the customers of our earlier devices.As for adhesive on the base of the mount — as usual, it's very strong and will keep the device in place on all sorts of dash surfaces, except for suede-like ones. And it leaves no traces when removed.The cables run straight to the mount not to the device This means, you only need to deal with wires once, when you first install HUDWAY Drive. After you install the device, plug the cable in the mount power port, secure the cable with dash clips, hide it between the dash and the windshield, then thread it behind the driver's seat to further plug it in the cigarette lighter receptacle. So, whenever you need to use the device, just plug the cable in the cigarette lighter receptacle, and it will power on automatically.Same is true for connecting the cameras — the video input port is located on the mount.Slide-in mechanism to easily dismount the deviceThere may be situations, when you want to drive without the device on the dash, or remove it when parking the car — or you may want to use it on your other vehicle (there will be extra mounts available for purchase later). Anyway, the slide-in mechanism makes removing the device and placing it back very quick and simple. By now, we have manufactured a small test batch and took the device to a range of vehicles to see how it would fit in the most popular models — and on some of the most challenging dashboards. It did awesome. See for yourself:HUDWAY Drive on Mercedes C-class HUDWAY Drive on BMW 3 E46 HUDWAY Drive on BMW X5 HUDWAY Drive on BMW X6 HUDWAY Drive on Toyota Camry HUDWAY Drive on Volkswagen Atlas HUDWAY Drive on Volkswagen Jetta HUDWAY Drive on Ford Mustang HUDWAY Drive on Mini Countryman HUDWAY Drive on Tesla Model STo make sure it will fit in your vehicle, download and print out the device mock-up. Then cut it out and take to your dash to check.One-time quick setup: as easy as connecting earphones to smartphoneHUDWAY Drive connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth, which is why you once you have paired the two once, every next time HUDWAY Drive will connect to your smartphone automaticaly, even when the latter stays in your pocket.See the full overview of connection options and what each offers in the FAQ.Directions, calls, texts and notifications brought to HUD over Bluetooth — while your phone stays in your pocket.Google Maps, Waze, or any other app you want to use behind the wheel — mirrored over AirPlay/ Miracast, or HUDWAY Drive private mirroring protocol. Whatever you see on your smartphone screen — you can now see in head-up display mode.HUDWAY Drive has a video input (CVBS) port to connect a camera to it — sounds simple, but let's dig in detail to see why we consider it a supervaluable addition to HUDWAY Drive — and how it can augment your driving experience.The rearview camera automatically turns on when selecting the reverse gear. It's equipped with rear parking distance sensors and and LED lights. Parking sensors measure the distance to the obstacles. Lights ensure that you get a legible video of what’s behind the vehicle when it’s dark.Not only the camera displays the video of what's behind the rear bumper, but also visualizes the space around the vehicle alerting on the proximity to the obstacles.  The viewing angle is 170°, and the waterproof rating is IP69 (will withstand any weather conditions).Sideview camera allows you to control blind spots when turning or overtaking. The video starts streaming automatically when your turn signal is on.We recommend that the side view cameras are installed on the fender close to the front door gap. This way, it involves no drilling of the body, and the wires can be hidden more neatly.The viewing angle is 120°, and the waterproof rating is IP69 (will withstand any weather conditions). Each of these cameras can be used as front/rear/left/right side view camera according to your need.Night vision thermal camera displays the objects ahead that are otherwise beyond your headlights reach. It detects heat from the objects without a need for light, allowing you to see up to four times farther down the road. You’ll have visibility through dust, smoke, or fog, and better capability to avoid an accident. With the operating temperature range of -40 °F to 155 °F (-40 °C to 70 °C) and IP67 waterproof rating, the camera will withstand most extreme weather conditions. Each camera set comes with a video selector unit so that you can preset which video signal you want to appear on HUD — and with a remote control to actually configure such a preset.The cameras connect to video selector using S-video cables — these allow to power the cameras and transmit the video signal. Then, you'll need to plug the RCA cable running from the video selector unit in HUDWAY Drive — and hide all the wires.Note: Please note that installing cameras, especially the night vision one, may require a qualified specialist. Detailed information and instructions how to connect the cameras are posted in one of our updates.At the moment, HUDWAY Drive is on a prototype stage. But it's a prototype ready for production. We have selected the vendors and component suppliers, signed the manufacturing contracts — and even prepaid the tooling for major components. Production and assembly will be done in China by our trusted partners.  To launch mass production and maintain the pricing we offer, we need a large order — and we're asking you to join in and contribute to that amount.Production leadtime is 2 months since the end of the crowdfunding campaign, which is why the delivery date is set to August. We do not foresee any major risk factors or complications. As usual, the lens is the most complicated component to manufacture and get ready for assembly. Luckily, we've been dealing with HUD lenses since 2015, and know well how to make them great. Join in, back the project — and rest assured, we will deliver.Many of the customers of HUDWAY Cast (our earlier device) ask us how HUDWAY Drive is different from that. In short, HUDWAY Drive addresses most of the issues the users of both our earlier devices faced. The key differences are:Improved connectivityHUDWAY Drive connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth, which is quick, hassle-free and reliable. With this type of connection you will be able to use navigation powered by MapBox and driving widgets. Also, incoming calls and notifications will be fetched and visualised to HUD — and sound will be played via the output source you select.Alternatively, you can mirror any application (your exact phone screen contents) to HUD. This is how you can view Waze, Google Maps, or any other app on HUD. This time we're using a different way to do the mirroring — and not relying on AirPlay or Miracast. However, the latter two will be still supported in HUDWAY Drive.Learn more on the connection options in the Help Center.Slimmer & improved designHUDWAY Drive uses an extra slim and flexible mount which follows the curves of your dash and looks integral to the vehicle interior. And — it now fits in the vehicles where there’s very little space between the dash and the windshield (like in some BMW models).The lens is now also smaller and flatter, of a much better quality and with more advanced coatings — thus, the projection will not be blurry or distorted.Convenient mountingHUDWAY Drive affixes to the mount using a slide-in lock, and the power cable plugs in the mount not in the device, which is why it’s now easier to take the device off and place it back.The mount also absorbs vehicle vibration which was the issue reported by some of HUDWAY Cast users.Video inputFor those using additional cameras in their vehicles, HUDWAY Drive offers a video input port (CVBS) which was impossible with HUDWAY Cast.Reliable softwareBy default, HUDWAY Drive uses navigation and routes provided by MapBox. Alternatively, you can use HUDWAY Go or any other app (using screen mirroring) if you choose to.On the whole, HUDWAY Drive is superior to HUDWAY Cast in terms of functionality, design and usability.Having started in 2013, we've been focusing on a very specific range of solutions — HUD & ADAS software and hardware products. This is our core competence.It is our mission to bring safety on the road through ongoing innovations, and we keep improving and enhancing our products to make this possible.

 Track your bike in real-time with 5G/LTE connectivity - whether it’s parked or on the move. Know the moment your bike is moved or jostled. Motion detectors signal your phone within 10 milliseconds of being tampered with. MaxTracker is discreetly hidden in a water bottle cage made from aerospace-grade polycarbonate and nylon-12.Any tampering or movement can also set off a piercing alarm to deter thieves from further pursuit. *Alarm is optional. Can be turned on/off in app settings.   Charge MaxTracker while installed on the bike, or take it off to charge in your home, car, or anywhere else.  Smart and efficient battery management with the app always displaying your battery level.  *Armed mode disables automatic battery management.    Designed to last in extreme temperatures and weather conditions (IP67) - through any adventure, rain or shine. Choose when to be notified - when your bike is jostled, directionally moved, pushed past a geofence, or a mix of the three.    Capture waypoints of your ride with the MaxTracker app, and allow family & friends to track your ride in real time.   Install or remove in seconds. All you need is your key, unique to each MaxTracker.  If a water bottle holder isn’t your style, or your bike doesn’t allow room for one, MaxTracker’s wings can be removed for a more streamlined look.        Steve is a lifelong entrepreneur with deep experience in creating systems and building talented teams to create new products and services across a number of business categories.The development of MaxTracker fulfills Steve’s passion and mission: To reverse the past outcomes of bicycle theft so the owners win and the thieves go to jail. Jim is an experienced technology entrepreneur with several ventures in the sports and fitness industry.

A vehicle of the future.COMMUTE WITHOUT COMPROMISE. Power, comfort, and portability unite.Curious about the secret behind all of these features? Let us tell you all about it below:1. Ultra-premium Materials, Extraordinary Product ValueFor Scotsman the ENTIRE FRAME is crafted from ultra-premium thermoplastic AS4 (aerospace grade) carbon fiber composite, including the handlebar, stem, fork, baseboard, suspension, battery bay, and other support structures. So while Scotsman is a large, full-sized scooter with the power of high-performance electric vehicles, it is lightweight and portable like smaller, lower powered scooters. Scotsman has the best of both worlds, with speed, comfort and portability.Many of our competitors like to boast that they use carbon fiber. But only Scotsman uses a 100% carbon fiber composite body, giving you the full benefits of the material and nothing short of it.Carry Your CommuteFolds down in seconds for easy transport and compact storage.Sleek Goes SteadyThanks to carbon fiber’s high strength-to-weight ratio, we don’t have to use much of it to create a large, strong, but light structure. Our large ten-inch wheels, generous 8-inch wide deck, and long-wheelbase work together to ensure a comfortable and safe ride.Roll with the PunchesSuspension system integrated right into the baseboard. Proprietary to only our advanced 3D printing process.2. Your Personal Power StationEach PowerPack doubles as a power bank with a USB-C (100W PD) port to charge your computer, phone, or other electronics. More demanding users can opt to get a Performance PowerPack that has more energy capacity (550 Wh) and enables a special turbo mode on the Scotsman (still in development - more on this after we exit beta). Note: the Scotsman 2000 comes standard with a Performance PowerPack.More Power to YouDual battery bays satisfy the power-hungry. Add a second battery to double your range. Take Charge, Give ChargeEasily remove your PowerPack and charge it at your desk.With pass-through charging capability built into the battery management system, you can charge your Mac while charging your PowerPack.3. A Mode for Every RoadChoose from three different motor power levels. ….more SPECS below!4. Connected SoftwareAside from the advanced product design, you will not miss out on connected features. Ultra Wide-Angle 1080p DashcamThe world's first built-in dashcam that enables you to capture photos (anytime) during your ride. You can even snap a shot of your scooter’s surroundings when the Find My Scooter feature is triggered, letting you know exactly where your Scotsman is, together with its GPS location. Enter the CockpitThe LCD panel displays battery level, speed, riding mode, turn-by-turn navigation, distance traveled, and distance remaining. Your Scotsman will remind you when to charge your scooter battery or replace it with a new one.Scotsman App: Smart and ConnectedBeing a truly modern vehicle, the Scotsman is of course fully connected (4G cellular and Bluetooth) and comes with the Scotsman App which enables a range of functions. Below is the sneak-peak of how the Scotsman App is turning out. The full Scotsman App will be ready for both iOS and Android by the time we ship. REVIEWOn June 17th, 2021, we welcomed Ilan Cohen - Director of Crowdfunding at Indiegogo and KhanFlicks - Tech YouTuber, to visit Scotsman HQ and try out Scotsman's first prototype. Below is an up close look at our robotic arm 3D printing a Scotsman deck:

The frame is produced from aerospace-grade aluminium too, meaning the bike weighs just 20kg including battery and motor! Oh, and did you spot the concealed in-stem front suspension? Perfect for taking the lumps and bumps out of the city without spoiling the design...     

The Three Phase One features a removable, lockable battery with a fast charger so there's no need to carry the bike upstairs. And if you feel like pushing yourself then you don’t even have to turn the power on as it functions perfectly without it. And by the way, all electrical parts are waterproof rated too. 
 
      Check out this great review we got from our friends at digitalphat: Check out our friends from Tommy's Tech Review (German):     You’re probably thinking “yeah it looks nice, but what makes it better than the rest?”Well, the Three Phase One comes equipped with leading components (like Shimano gears, Tektro brakes and a Samsung battery) along with innovative technology meaning, you’ll be cycling smoother, going further, stopping faster, and turning more heads, all whilst looking awesome. Check out the features below...           Rather than messing around with stretch goals (like a lot of other products on Indiegogo), we’re giving you it all at once. Yep, you read that right.  When you buy a Three Phase One, you’ll get the same industry-leading components as everyone else, whether you buy right at the beginning, or a little later.       If you want the more hipster look, simply take the mudguards, lights and rear carrier off and WHAM! You got yourself a matte black, slick rick racing machine.      We’re offering two versions of the Three Phase One, the base and the boost model.Both come with the same sleek design and core features, but the boost model comes with some extra perks that make it perfect for those looking for something with a little more oomph. See their specs below.  Enhanced LCD Display on Boost Model     The Three Phase One comes in either black or white, but why?Reduced colours mean quicker production, quicker logistics and quicker deliveries, so you’ll get your bike sooner - plus reduced carbon emissions. It’s a win-win.            We love cycling and we love the environment! That’s why we've teamed up with ONE TREE PLANTED to plant one tree for each bike sold. Carbon emissions could be reduced by 12 percent if just 15 percent of urban transportation miles travelled were instead made by e-bike.**Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment        Production Has BegunWe didn't want the Lunar New Year's celebrations to slow us down, so we fired up the assembly lines early and have already begun our first production line.     You’ll be glad to know we’re not amateurs, but a keen bunch of cyclists looking to make a change to the E-Bike game.

Factory settings of maximum speed for three versions of the LEOWAY 2WD eScooter. When ordering, you can choose one of them.*Three levels of maximum eScooter speed. You can additionally set the maximum speed in the LEOWAY 2WD eScooter settings. The innovative i-2WD Smart Traction Control Module was developed specifically for the dual-motor eScooter. LEOWAY 2WD eScooter has two motors, but only the rear motor works continuously. This allows you to significantly save battery power and increase mileage. But when power from the rear motor is not enough (ledge, curb, climb, accelerate, etc.), or the rear wheel skids (water, grass, pebble, sand, etc.), i-2WD Control Module automatically activates the front motor. Due to this, the rider can confidently and safely ride regardless of the terrain and road surface.LEOWAY 2WD eScooter has a dual motor that mutually operates to reach maximum performance. When we say “performance”, we mean stability, safety, agility, and durability.  When LEOWAY 2WD eScooter starts riding, i-2WD Smart Traction Control Module automatically activates the front motor and the scooter starts to ride confidently on any surface. i-2WD Control Module disables the front motor when the scooter is moving on flat terrain to save energy.  When it is necessary to accelerate and the power of the rear motor is not enough, i-2WD Control Module activates the front motor for thrilling acceleration.  Ride at walking speed or go full speed.  Hill climbing torque - i-2WD Control Module activates the front motor while riding uphill, helping the rider to confidently overcome steep hills up to 25 degrees. Batteries are automatically charged when riding from the hills through magnetic braking. The motors work as electric generators. i-2WD Control Module increases the recuperation of the rear motor, so you can confidently downhill. When the rear wheel skids (water, grass, pebble, sand, etc.) i-2WD Control Module automatically activates the front motor for a reliable and safe ride. Great riding stability in any traffic condition.  i-2WD Control Module identifies when one wheel is spinning significantly more, will apply brakes it slightly, and power transfer to the motor which still has grip. The drive mode select button is located on the steering wheel. You can choose one of two modes of operation of the motors:2WD - Two motors work at the same time;i-2WD - Rear motor work constantly, the front motor is activated automatically.  Two high-efficiency Li-ion batteries with a total power of 721Wh give you freedom of riding. Mileage on a single charge up to 90km/56miles due to the intelligent i-2WD Smart Dual Drive. Recharge LEOWAY 2WD eScooter once every two weeks.  You can take the one battery out and charge easily separated from the eScooter.   You can have several of these batteries for a very long ride.  Each battery has its own charging port. Two chargers allow you to fully charge two batteries in a record of 2-3 hours. It is roughly the same amount of time your smartphone would need. Relax or have a snack and your scooter is ready at your disposal.  Each battery has its Smart Battery Management System (Smart-BMS). Smart-BMS monitors the battery status with multiple protection mechanisms: short circuit protection,  overcurrent protection, double overcharge protection, double over-discharge protection, overheating protection, under-voltage automatic sleep. Smart-BMS ensures battery safety and extends its service life.  You can unlock and power on LEOWAY 2WD eScooter via the NFC card. Accelerate on an eScooter to a speed above 8km/h (5mph), then lock the desired speed, by holding the throttle in the same position for 5 seconds. Cruise control will free you of the need to control the throttle the whole time, greatly improve your ride and help to avoid hand fatigue on long rides, especially in a straight line. Improved throttle for smoother acceleration.  Press the button on the throttle, you can choose a slow riding mode. The display shows the turtle symbol. The eScooter will be riding at a speed of 4km/h (2.5mph). You can go next to the scooter or carry cargo on it.  Inside the tire is a special sealant. If a nail or screw punctures a tire and remains in place, the sealant surrounds the object to avoid air loss. If the object punctures the tire and comes back out, the sealant will fill the tread puncture. The mechanical process forms a plug within 2-3 tire rotations. It acts so fast most riders would be unaware of a puncture.   LEOWAY 2WD eScooter has a dual braking system that provides for good stopping power. The electromagnetic brake of both wheels based on regenerative braking during the quick release of the throttle. A hand disk brake cuts off the power supply to the motor wheels instantly and allows you to brake at any time.   When you press the handbrake, the lights flash to warn the people both in front and behind. The eScooter equipped with 10-inch tubeless pneumatic tires can smoothly ride through any road. They make bumps on the ride hardly noticeable, supple rubber performs much better in adverse road conditions and delivers the most comfortable ride.  Live and accurate display of current battery voltage. We have installed many safety components. Front and rear lights are activated by pressing a button on the steering wheel. Front and rear LED lights to ensure you will be seen when riding in the dark.When the rider uses the brake lever, the rear light will flash to notify the riders/drivers behind the scooter. LED lights, bright enough to be seen away on foggy/rainy days.  You do not need to gesture in traffic or at night when you are planning to turn, just turn the steering wheel or tilt the scooter and the required turn signal will turn on automatically. The alarm is automatically activated when you turn off the power of the scooter, blocks the power-on of LEOWAY 2WD eScooter, and is triggered when it moved, emits sound and light signals. It cannot be turned on without deactivating the anti-theft alarm.  The roomy deck (190mm/7.5in) enables a comfortable stance and accommodates up to two people at the same time. Anti-slip coating with increased contact friction for rider safety.  Two folding options make the LEOWAY 2WD eScooter easy to carry or store.  Folds in 5 seconds for transport or to carry in one hand.  Scooter handles are unscrewed for a more compact size during transportation or storage. The width of the scooter is reduced to 250mm/9.8in. You go with an eScooter easily on the subway, fits in the trunk of a car, or under a desk, so you can take it with you anywhere.  Can be removed in 5 seconds for transport or storage.  Two small wheels in the front of the scooter’s deck will allow take it as a trolley when folded. You can remove the detachable battery and turn off the power of the second battery during long-term storage of the scooter. Batteries will hold a charge longer and it will be much safer.  This button can be used as a ""child lock"". If the button is not pressed, the eScooter cannot be turned on. Mobility is important for the city, which means that the e-scooter does not have to be heavy. LEOWAY 2WD eScooter is the lightest scooter of dual-drive electric scooters in the world. The scooter stem and deck are made from an aluminum-magnesium alloy and it weighs 30-40% less than other similar aluminum eScooters. LEOWAY 2WD eScooter is the lightest electric scooter with two motors. The idea to create a powerful and most importantly safe electric scooter with a dual-motor for the city came after we rode off-road electric scooters. But, they had one important drawback - a lot of weight. Which is unacceptable for the city. Therefore, we decided to create a powerful scooter for the city with a small weight and high range on a single charge.  In the process of prototyping the scooter, we realized that a removable battery would be a great convenience. As a result, we were able to create an electric scooter LEOWAY 2WD, which has a dual-motor, a removable battery, relatively lightweight, and a good mileage range.  For riding an eScooter on a smooth surface, such as asphalt or concrete, one single motor is enough. But, for safe riding on rough, slippery, or loose surfaces (ledge, curb, climb, water, grass, pebble, sand, etc.) or to accelerate it is necessary that dual-motor. To do this, an innovative i-2WD Smart Traction Control Module has been developed that automatically activates the front motor by analyzing the signals of sensors installed in the wheels. Due to this, the rider can confidently and safely ride regardless of the terrain and road surface. We work with professional enterprises such as Shenzhen Kixin Electronics, which specializes in producing and selling electric scooters and conversion kits.Founded in 2006 in Shenzhen, China, Shenzhen Kixin Electronics is committed to providing global consumers with high-end mobile digital peripherals that can create a good experience. The company is ISO9001 certified, BSCI factory, CE, RoHS, FCC certified for products.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Direct Drive:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you want the simpler option, direct drive is the way to go. It requires less maintenance, has a quiet motor, and the battery power can reach a further range on a single charge. If you’re someone who enjoys riding on endless roads, this is the choice for you.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Warning! The Belt drive’s brushless motor will provide you with a powerful, speedy ride. With a higher torque and greater acceleration, the Sex Panther Belt Drive is great for hilly areas or off-road rides. Keep in mind, when off-road the belt drive option is best compatible with the 6 inch All-Terrain wheels.</p>

This speed is based on real world testing with GPS tracking. </p>
<p>With the stock 97mm wheels, the Sex Panther can hit speeds up to 30mph. With the 105mm cloudwheels, the Sex Panther can hit 30+ mph. </p>
<p>Stay tuned for a video speed test. </p>
<p>Note: Top speed can vary with conditions like rider weight, terrain and wind. We’re curious to see who will be crowned speed king. Please ride safe.</p></details><p> </p>

<p>Range will vary with rider weight and conditions. If you weigh less you’ll likely get longer range, if you weigh more, you’ll likely get less. </p>
<p>With the Cloudwheels or AT wheels, you can expect the range to decrease.</p></details><p> </p>
<details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'><b>Why is the range longer than other boards?</b></summary><p>The Sex Panther comes with an ultra high capacity lithium battery, using next gen 21700 cells. Not only is there more total energy (648WH), the battery is also at a higher voltage - 43.2V compared to most boards at 36V. </p>
<p>For the techies, it’s a 43.2V 15AH 12S3P battery with 21700 Cells (648WH).</p>
<p>WH (Watt Hours) is a measurement of the total energy in a battery</p>
<p>In addition to the massive battery, the Sex Panther has less moving parts. NO BELTS = less friction = more efficient, this is why the Sex Panther can achieve incredible range. The Sex Panther PRO is belt drive which will decrease the range slightly but give better acceleration. </p>
<p>Beware: Many electric skateboard brands (especially the budget ones) don’t even publish their battery capacity. Are they afraid you’ll find out the truth? Some other brands flat out lie about the WH or intentionally miscalculate them to deceive you. </p></details><p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The motors are completely waterproof and can run completely underwater. The electronics and battery in the deck are sealed pretty well by the grip tape, but if water manages to seep in over time it can damage them. For prolonged life, it’s not a good idea to submerge the whole board or ride in heavy/torrential rains. The warranty does not cover water damage.</p></details><p> </p>

You can cruise over grass, especially on the Sex Panther PRO with AT wheels on. Grass takes more energy to roll over than asphalt, so it will slow any board down and use more battery than it would on hard surfaces.</p></details><p> </p>

Be careful to avoid deep patches of loose sand or mud as they can stop you in your tracks. Other than that the powerful motors and big wheels combination can handle pretty much anything you throw at it.</details><p> </p>

Keep in mind saltwater and sand will give the board more wear than normal riding - so be sure to clean it well after riding and remember the better you take care of it, the less likely you are to need replacement components in the future.</p></details><p> </p>

What's Inside?



 
 
 
Which should you choose?
Don’t fret, we’ll walk you through it. 

Direct Drive:
If you want the simpler option, direct drive is the way to go. It requires less maintenance, has a quiet motor, and the battery power can reach a further range on a single charge. If you’re someone who enjoys riding on endless roads, this is the choice for you.

 
Belt Drive:
Warning! The Belt drive’s brushless motor will provide you with a powerful, speedy ride. With a higher torque and greater acceleration, the Sex Panther Belt Drive is great for hilly areas or off-road rides. Keep in mind, when off-road the belt drive option is best compatible with the 6 inch All-Terrain wheels.

 

HAND LAID CARBON FIBER DECK

The Sex Panther's  carbon fiber deck is hand laid, extremely strong and designed to take a beating. It's rated for riders up to 330lbs and as beautiful as a work of art.

This Isn't Our First Rodeo
We've done it before. We're doing it again.
You can trust us to deliver you an awesome board.

Hi, I'm Rob Rast. Founder and CEO of Miles Board.
We launched Miles Board in 2017 with one goal. We wanted to show the world electric vehicles don't have to be big bulky contraptions. They can be sleek, sexy, and most of all - something you'll be proud to ride.
Together with our sister company, FLX Bike, we've sold over $17 Million in electric vehicles on Indiegogo alone. At one point, there were so many orders that we actually moved into the factory to personally oversee and inspect every detail of production.
There were challenges every step of the way. We put our heads down, worked past obstacles and delivered on every order placed. Now we're ready to serve you in a way that's bigger and better than ever before...
So join us, for the ride of your life.
Rob, and Team Miles


 
 
You're not a customer. You're a Miles rider.
We've got your back. We put our hearts and souls into training a passionate team to help you get the most out of your board. We may have different backgrounds, skaters, engineers, pro riders, designers, students, athletes… but we're driven by the same goal: to create and share the coolest electric vehicles with the you.

Give us a chance to serve you. We'll deliver a ride so fun that your face will hurt from all the smiling and laughing.

Frequently Asked Questions
General
Is this a donation or will I get a board?When you checkout on Indiegogo, you'll see something that reads: ""Your donation is a way to support a project but does not guarantee that you will receive a perk.""
This is just Indiegogo's way of protecting themselves with legal language. They have no control over what type of projects are funded on their platform so they want to cover their butts.
We have a rock-solid track record and we guarantee the shipment of every single board.

When you order on a crowdfunding site, it's a great idea to do some due diligence so you can judge how trustworthy the campaigners are. This is our 5th Indiegogo campaign - and each one has delivered. The latest campaign (which broke Indiegogo’s all time funding record) is thousands of orders deep in the shipping process. 
You can expect regular campaign updates from us detailing our humble work and the manufacturing process as well while we build your board. 
I hope you can recognize that track record and the invaluable experience built up over the years. We are here for the long run and guarantee the shipment of every board ordered. 
Do you have financing?Financing is coming soon on the Miles Board website, please check back the week of May 3rd for an official link. You'll be able to get financing by choosing Klarna or Paypal credit as your payment method at checkout. Both options are only valid for customers in the US. 
Can it really do 30mph?Yes. This speed is based on real world testing with GPS tracking. 
With the stock 97mm wheels, the Sex Panther can hit speeds up to 30mph. With the 105mm cloudwheels, the Sex Panther can hit 30+ mph. 
Stay tuned for a video speed test. 
Note: Top speed can vary with conditions like rider weight, terrain and wind. We’re curious to see who will be crowned speed king. Please ride safe. 
What range can you get?On the standard 97mm wheels, we estimate a real world range of up to 40 miles on the Sex Panther (Direct Drive) and up to 35 miles on the Sex Panther PRO (Belt Drive).
Range will vary with rider weight and conditions. If you weigh less you’ll likely get longer range, if you weigh more, you’ll likely get less. 
With the Cloudwheels or AT wheels, you can expect the range to decrease. 
Why is the range longer than other boards?The Sex Panther comes with an ultra high capacity lithium battery, using next gen 21700 cells. Not only is there more total energy (648WH), the battery is also at a higher voltage - 43.2V compared to most boards at 36V. 
For the techies, it’s a 43.2V 15AH 12S3P battery with 21700 Cells (648WH).
WH (Watt Hours) is a measurement of the total energy in a battery
In addition to the massive battery, the Sex Panther has less moving parts. NO BELTS = less friction = more efficient, this is why the Sex Panther can achieve incredible range. The Sex Panther PRO is belt drive which will decrease the range slightly but give better acceleration. 
Beware: Many electric skateboard brands (especially the budget ones) don’t even publish their battery capacity. Are they afraid you’ll find out the truth? Some other brands flat out lie about the WH or intentionally miscalculate them to deceive you.  
How long does it take to charge?Typically 5-7 hours, slightly longer if completely dead. 
I'm heavy, can I ride it? If you weigh less than 330lbs, that’s a big YES. Though we often ride 2 up for a combined weight of ~350lbs, we can’t officially endorse it. Performance will decline with increased weight and the boards are not officially tested past 330lbs. 
I'm tall, can I ride it?Yes, there’s no height limit and the board is very stable for all folks short and tall. 
Can you ride it without the battery or remote?Yes! You can ride the Sex Panther Direct Drive like a normal skateboard with no power. The motors are precision engineered for the least drag possible. It’s a breeze to push and cruises smooth.
The belt drive Sex Panther PRO has more rolling resistance and can not be easily ridden with no power. 
Is this practical to use for commuting daily to work (5-10 miles) and shopping etc? Yes! That’s a great distance to shred on your Sex Panther. You should easily make it there and back no problem. You’ll have more fun, save more money and likely beat uber, traffic, busses etc. 
Can I ride it underwater?The Sex Panther is IP65 water resistant. That means you can ride through rain and decent sized puddles but you shouldn’t go swimming with it.
 

 
The motors are completely waterproof and can run completely underwater. The electronics and battery in the deck are sealed pretty well by the grip tape, but if water manages to seep in over time it can damage them. For prolonged life, it’s not a good idea to submerge the whole board or ride in heavy/torrential rains. The warranty does not cover water damage. 
Can I ride it in the grass?YES. You can cruise over grass, especially on the Sex Panther PRO with AT wheels on. Grass takes more energy to roll over than asphalt, so it will slow any board down and use more battery than it would on hard surfaces. 
Can I ride the Sex Panther off-road? YES, throw on the cloudwheels or AT wheels and the Sex Panther will tear up the dirt. Be careful to avoid deep patches of loose sand or mud as they can stop you in your tracks. Other than that the powerful motors and big wheels combination can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. 
Can I ride it in the sand?Yes, you can ride it over damp or compacted sand - we recommend using AT wheels or cloudwheels for this. Keep in mind saltwater and sand will give the board more wear than normal riding - so be sure to clean it well after riding and remember the better you take care of it, the less likely you are to need replacement components in the future. 
How does the Sex Panther handle extreme temperatures?The Sex Panther's battery is tested to perform in temperatures of -4F to 113F (-20C to 45C). 
At lower temperatures the battery capacity will decrease, so we recommend keeping the board at room temperature before you ride. 
Will the production Sex Panther be exactly like the ones pictured? We’re extremely happy with The Sex Panther now. We do reserve the right to make modifications in the interest of making your Sex Panther even better. We may also release some stretch goals during the campaign with upgrades to the board. Stay tuned! 
Support
Is there a warranty?Yes, we’ve got your back with a 6 month warranty that covers the entire board from defect or malfunction under normal use. If anything on the board should stop working, just hit up support at help@milesboard.com - our expert technicians will help you diagnose and get you rolling again in no time! The warranty doesn’t cover damage from misuse (including water damage), tampering or unauthorized alterations/repairs. 
What if it's past the warranty or I broke it myself?No stress, we still have your back with excellent support (from real humans in the US) and will help you purchase the correct part to get rolling ASAP. 
Components
Does the Sex Panther have lights? The stock boards do not include lights. However the Shred More Bundle includes a 4 pack of SL-200 Shredlights, Cloudwheels and the Miles Jetpack. The Shredlights have 200 Lumens of brightness each (2 headlights, 2 tail lights) and can run for up to 150 hours. 
If I wear the wheels out, can I replace them? Yes, the Sex Panther uses standard skateboard wheels, and can be swapped in seconds with one turn of the included skate tool. 
I just crashed and broke my_____ where can I get a replacement? You can find all replacement components here. Can’t find it? Email us at help@milesboard.com. 
Payments and Shipping
When does it ship? After we get the funds from Indiegogo, we'll build the boards and deliver them as soon as possible. We expect most orders to ship 3-4 months after the order is placed. Shipping estimates listed on the campaign page are estimates of when your order will leave our factory and does not include the time en route to your address. 
Where do you ship? How long will it take? How much is shipping?After we build the boards, most orders outside the US will ship directly from the factory and arrive approximately 2-5 weeks after shipment. 
US orders will be shipped via container to San Diego and then via courier to your door, they'll arrive approximately 6 weeks after shipment from the factory. 
Please refer to this table for shipping rates and handling times. 
Note: There's an additional shipping fee for orders to Hawaii and Alaska. If you order from Hawaii or Alaska, please choose the corresponding add-on perk at checkout, it will cover the shipping to your door. 
Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT? Our freight forwarder has reported the fees for most of the shipping locations are inclusive of taxes. If any additional taxes are levied, the backer is responsible. Please check your country's import duties before purchasing. It is 0% in the US and varies internationally - we'll do our best to minimize this for you. 
Can I test one at your office?Yes! Come cruise by the showroom in San Diego.  
What's the refund policy?Shortly after an order is placed, we will lock the contribution. This means we have begun placing orders for the components to build the board with our suppliers. At this point the board is in production and we can’t change or refund the order. We don’t mess around with production - when you order a board, we build you a board! 
Can I pick mine up in San Diego to avoid the shipping charge? Sorry, we can’t offer local pickup. We expect a very busy shipping season and to speed up all deliveries we will be shipping via UPS, Fedex and other couriers. 
Misc
Do I need to wear a helmet?We strongly recommend wearing a good helmet, especially considering the high speed of the Sex Panther. Accidents happen (ask Rob). A helmet can protect you from serious brain damage and even death. Not only that, it’s the law in many places. Bottom line: you and you alone are responsible for your own decisions, not us, not anybody else. Please don’t come crying to us if you crack your skull or get a ticket. We trust you’ll make the right decision for you each time you ride.
The Sex Panther is a high speed vehicle, NOT a toy! Check out this video where a helmet saved my friend’s life.

Other protective gear can save you from scrapes if you’re new to skating, riding hard or just clumsy. Please be safe out there! 
Can you take it on an airplane? No, the Sex Panther's battery is 6.5 times higher capacity than that allowed by ICAO regulations for air travel.  
Is the Sex Panther legal to ride on my roads? Please check the regulations of your jurisdiction to find out where you can or can't ride. Above all, ride safely and responsibly. Your destiny is in your hands. We just help you get there faster. 
Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world? Yes, the charger is rated 100-240V the standard charger is a US plug. We’ll do our best to match the plug to your country but no guarantee as this detail can slow shipping for all orders. If so you may need a plug adapter.

<p>Note: Top speed can vary with conditions like rider weight, terrain and wind. We’re curious to see who will be crowned speed king. Please ride safe.</p></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'><b>Why do you use direct drive motors instead of belt or hub motors?</b></summary><p><strong>TLDR: More Speed, More Range, Better Ride</strong></p>
<p>Belt motors are typically geared down so they can achieve more torque than hub motors. The torque helps in acceleration, hill climbing and off road riding. There is a trade off however, as there are more moving parts, more friction and a loud whine. That means range and top speed can suffer with belt motors. If you’ve ever tried to ride a board with belt motors, you can feel what a drag all those moving parts and friction can be. On or off, that friction is what robs you of speed and range.  </p>
<p>Hub motors on the other hand have a motor directly inside the wheel. Because there’s no belt, this reduces drag while also improving range. However a drawback with hub motors is that there’s only a thin layer of material between the motor and the road - which leads to a bumpy ride, and you’re stuck with only the wheel options that are custom made for each motor. </p>With the Phantom, we chose to use <strong>powerful direct drive motors.</strong> They’re mounted directly on the axle and the wheel mounts adjacent to them. You get all the efficiency benefits of the hub motor, but with a normal skateboard wheel. You have more material to absorb bumps on the road and you can swap to any abec or kegel wheel you like in seconds.</details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'><b>What range can you get?</b></summary><p>On the standard 97mm wheels, Rob got 29 miles on his range test riding quite hard through San Diego. He weighs 165 with gear. Range will vary with rider weight and conditions. If you weigh less you’ll likely get longer range, if you weigh more, you’ll likely get less.</p>

<p>With the cloudwheels the range is expected to drop slightly, we estimate to 20-25 miles. Stay tuned for an official range test with those wheels.</p></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'><b>Why is the range longer than other boards?</b></summary><p>The Phantom comes with an ultra high capacity lithium battery, using next gen 21700 cells. Not only is there more total energy (432WH), the battery is also at a higher voltage - 43.2V compared to most boards at 36V. </p>
<p>For the techies, it’s a 43.2V 10AH 12S2P battery with 21700 Cells (432WH).</p>
<p>WH (Watt Hours) is a measurement of the total energy in a battery</p>
<p>In addition to the massive battery, the Phantom has less moving parts. NO BELTS = less friction = more efficient, this is why the Phantom can achieve incredible range. .</p> <strong>Beware:</strong> Many electric skateboard brands (especially the budget ones) don’t even publish their battery capacity. Are they afraid you’ll find out the truth?</details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'><b>How long does it take to charge?</b></summary><p>Typically 3-4 hours, slightly longer if completely dead.</p></details><p> </p><details><summary data-emoji_font=""true"" style='font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols, ""Segoe UI Emoji"", ""Segoe UI Symbol"", Symbola, EmojiSymbols !important;'><b>I'm heavy, can I ride it?</b></summary> If you weigh less than 270 lbs, that’s a big YES.

We'll deliver a ride so fun that your face will hurt from all the smiling and laughing.If you have any questions, feel free to contact us with the links below or meet us at the San Diego HQ for a shred sesh!Messenger | Email | San Diego Showroom  Still Have Questions?Keep an eye out for the next Q&A, live from Miles HQ!Or watch a replay below-  Frequently Asked QuestionsGeneralIs this a donation or will I get a board?When you checkout on Indiegogo, you'll see something that reads: ""Your donation is a way to support a project but does not guarantee that you will receive a perk.""
This is just Indiegogo's way of protecting themselves with legal language. They have no control over what type of projects are funded on their platform so they want to cover their butts.
We have a rock-solid track record and we guarantee the shipment of every single board.

When you order on a crowdfunding site, it's a great idea to do some due diligence so you can judge how trustworthy the campaigners are. This is our 5th Indiegogo campaign - and each one has delivered. The latest campaign (which broke Indiegogo’s all time funding record) is thousands of orders deep in the shipping process. 
You can expect regular campaign updates from us detailing our humble work and the manufacturing process as well while we build your board. 
I hope you can recognize that track record and the invaluable experience built up over the years. We are here for the long run and guarantee the delivery of every board ordered. Do you have financing?Yes, on the Miles Board website, you can get financing by choosing Klarna or Paypal credit as your payment method at checkout. Both options are only valid for customers in the US. Click here to order.   Can it really do 30mph?Yes. This speed is based on real world testing with GPS tracking. 
With the stock 97mm wheels, the Phantom can hit speeds of about 28mph. With the 105mm cloudwheels, the Phantom can hit 30+ mph. 
You can check out my speed test here:

 
Note: Top speed can vary with conditions like rider weight, terrain and wind. We’re curious to see who will be crowned speed king. Please ride safe. Why do you use direct drive motors instead of belt or hub motors?TLDR: More Speed, More Range, Better Ride
Belt motors are typically geared down so they can achieve more torque than hub motors. The torque helps in acceleration, hill climbing and off road riding. There is a trade off however, as there are more moving parts, more friction and a loud whine. That means range and top speed can suffer with belt motors. If you’ve ever tried to ride a board with belt motors, you can feel what a drag all those moving parts and friction can be. On or off, that friction is what robs you of speed and range.  
Hub motors on the other hand have a motor directly inside the wheel. Because there’s no belt, this reduces drag while also improving range. However a drawback with hub motors is that there’s only a thin layer of material between the motor and the road - which leads to a bumpy ride, and you’re stuck with only the wheel options that are custom made for each motor. With the Phantom, we chose to use powerful direct drive motors. They’re mounted directly on the axle and the wheel mounts adjacent to them. You get all the efficiency benefits of the hub motor, but with a normal skateboard wheel. You have more material to absorb bumps on the road and you can swap to any abec or kegel wheel you like in seconds. What range can you get?On the standard 97mm wheels, Rob got 29 miles on his range test riding quite hard through San Diego. He weighs 165 with gear. Range will vary with rider weight and conditions. If you weigh less you’ll likely get longer range, if you weigh more, you’ll likely get less.
 

 
With the cloudwheels the range is expected to drop slightly, we estimate to 20-25 miles. Stay tuned for an official range test with those wheels. Why is the range longer than other boards?The Phantom comes with an ultra high capacity lithium battery, using next gen 21700 cells. Not only is there more total energy (432WH), the battery is also at a higher voltage - 43.2V compared to most boards at 36V. 
For the techies, it’s a 43.2V 10AH 12S2P battery with 21700 Cells (432WH).
WH (Watt Hours) is a measurement of the total energy in a battery
In addition to the massive battery, the Phantom has less moving parts. NO BELTS = less friction = more efficient, this is why the Phantom can achieve incredible range. . Beware: Many electric skateboard brands (especially the budget ones) don’t even publish their battery capacity. Are they afraid you’ll find out the truth? How long does it take to charge?Typically 3-4 hours, slightly longer if completely dead. I'm heavy, can I ride it? If you weigh less than 270 lbs, that’s a big YES. Though we often ride 2 up for a combined weight of ~350lbs, we can’t officially endorse it. Performance will decline with increased weight and the boards are not officially tested past 270lbs. I'm tall, can I ride it?Yes, there’s no height limit and the board is very stable for all folks short and tall. Can you ride it without the battery or remote? Yes! The motors are precision engineered for the least drag possible. Boards with belt motors, are a drag to push with no power. The Phantom is a breeze to push and cruises smooth. Is this practical to use for commuting daily to work (5-10 miles) and shopping etc? Yes! That’s a great distance to shred on your Phantom. You should easily make it there and back no problem. You’ll have more fun, save more money and likely beat uber, traffic, busses etc. Can I ride it underwater?The Phantom is IP65 water resistant. That means you can ride through rain and decent sized puddles but you shouldn’t go swimming with it.
The motors are completely waterproof and can run completely underwater. The electronics and battery in the deck are sealed pretty well by the grip tape, but if water manages to seep in over time it can damage them. For prolonged life, it’s not a good idea to submerge the whole board or ride in heavy/torrential rains. The warranty does not cover water damage. Can I ride it in the grass? YES. You can cruise over cut grass from a dead stop but may want to get a rolling start if it's on the longer side. Grass takes more energy to roll over than asphalt, so it will slow any board down and use more battery than it would on hard surfaces. Can I ride the Phantom off-road? YES, throw on the cloudwheels and the Phantom will tear up the dirt. Be careful to avoid deep patches of loose sand or mud as they can stop you in your tracks. Other than that the powerful direct drive motors and cloudwheels combination can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. Can I ride it in the sand?YES, throw on the cloudwheels and the Phantom will tear up the dirt. Be careful to avoid deep patches of loose sand or mud as they can stop you in your tracks. Other than that the powerful direct drive motors and cloudwheels combination can handle pretty much anything you throw at it.
  How does the Phantom handle extreme temperatures?The Phantom's battery is tested to perform in temperatures of -4F to 113F (-20C to 45C). 
At lower temperatures the battery capacity will decrease, so we recommend keeping the board at room temperature before you ride. Will the production Phantom be exactly like the ones pictured? We’re extremely happy with the Phantom now. We do reserve the right to make modifications in the interest of making your Phantom even better. We may also release some stretch goals during the campaign with upgrades to the board. Stay tuned! SupportIs there a warranty?Yes, we’ve got your back with a 6 month warranty that covers the entire board from defect or malfunction under normal use. If anything on the board should stop working, just hit up support at help@milesboard.com - our expert technicians will help you diagnose and get you rolling again in no time! The warranty doesn’t cover damage from misuse (including water damage), tampering or unauthorized alterations/repairs. What if it's past the warranty or I broke it myself?No stress, we still have your back with excellent support (from real humans in the US) and will help you purchase the correct part to get rolling ASAP. ComponentsDoes the Phantom have lights? The VIP Pro Bundle comes with the latest and greatest SL-200 Shredlights. They’ve got 200 Lumens of brightness each (2 headlights, 2 tail lights) and can run for up to 150 hours. If I wear the wheels out, can I replace them? Yes, the Phantom uses standard skateboard wheels, and can be swapped in seconds with one turn of the included skate tool. I just crashed and broke my_____ where can I get a replacement? You can find all replacement components here. Can’t find it? Email us at help@milesboard.com. Payments and ShippingWhen does it ship? After we get the funds from Indiegogo, we'll build the boards and deliver them as soon as possible. We expect most orders to ship 3-4 months after the order is placed. Shipping estimates listed on the campaign page are estimates of when your order will leave our factory and does not include the time en route to your address. Where do you ship? How long will it take? How much is shipping?After we build the boards, most orders outside the US will ship directly from the factory and arrive approximately 2-5 weeks after shipment. 
US orders will be shipped via container to San Diego and then via courier to your door, they'll arrive approximately 6 weeks after shipment from the factory. 
Please refer to this table for shipping rates and handling times. 
Note: There's an additional shipping fee for orders to Hawaii and Alaska. If you order from Hawaii or Alaska, we will reach out to collect the difference in actual shipping cost prior to shipment.  Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT? Our freight forwarder has reported the fees for most of the shipping locations are inclusive of taxes. If any additional taxes are levied, the backer is responsible. Please check your country's import duties before purchasing. It is 0% in the US and varies internationally - we'll do our best to minimize this for you. Can I test one at your office?Yes! Come cruise by the showroom in San Diego. 
  What's the refund policy?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here. Shortly after an order is placed, we will lock the contribution. This means we have begun placing orders for the components to build the board with our suppliers. At this point we can’t change or refund the order. We don’t mess around with production - when you order a board, we build you a board! Can I pick mine up in San Diego to avoid the shipping charge? Sorry, we can’t offer local pickup. We expect a very busy shipping season and to speed up all deliveries we will be shipping via UPS, Fedex and other couriers. MiscDo I need to wear a helmet?We strongly recommend wearing a good helmet, especially considering the high speed of the Phantom. Accidents happen (ask Rob : D ). A helmet can protect you from serious brain damage and even death. Not only that, it’s the law in many places. Bottom line: you and you alone are responsible for your own decisions, not us, not anybody else. Please don’t come crying to us if you crack your skull or get a ticket. We trust you’ll make the right decision for you each time you ride.
The Phantom is a high speed vehicle, NOT a toy! Check out this video where a helmet saved my friend’s life.

https://youtu.be/ci6S7zUGG9Q?t=319
Other protective gear can save you from scrapes if you’re new to skating, riding hard or just clumsy. Please be safe out there! Can you take it on an airplane? No, the Phantom’s battery is 4.3 times higher capacity than that allowed by ICAO regulations for air travel.  Is the Phantom legal to ride on my roads? Please check the regulations of your jurisdiction to find out where you can or can't ride. Above all, ride safely and responsibly. Your destiny is in your hands. We just help you get there faster. Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world? Yes, the charger is rated 100-240V the standard charger is a US plug. We’ll do our best to match the plug to your country but no guarantee as this detail can slow shipping for all orders. If so you may need a plug adapter. Are you hiring? Yes.

The original true unibody carbon fiber bicycle, 3D printed in industrial-grade carbon fiber and nothing else.Superstrata EUnibody with a boost. The strength of unibody construction meets the stamina of power-assisted propulsion. Superstrata WheelsRevive your ride, lighten your trip. Carbon fiber wheels 3D-printed to fit your carbon fiber bike. Aside from the original Snow and Jet, the Superstrata also comes in multiple colors for you to customize. Superstrata UltramanA special collaboration between Ultraman and Superstrata, this edition features the color of the iconic superhero as well as a symbol of strength.This special edition is an upgrade option for new backers who back a Superstrata (for both the Superstrata C and E) - simply choose this perk as you check out. During the In-demand period, this perk will be available for $499. Time-Warp X Superstrata: A bike that shinesCelebrating the convergence of music and technology, this Time-Warp X Superstrata edition is a special collaboration between Time-Warp, one of the most renowned music festivals, and Superstrata. It features a special coating that lights up your bike in the dark, at just the touch of a button.During the In-demand period, this perk will be available for $499. The premium duo for a personal touchThe brilliant Aurora The fiery LavaBoth of these premium colors are also upgradable perks for $399 during the In-Demand period of the campaign. 6 essential colors to light up your ride  These essential colors come at no extra cost and will be available as an option for all existing backers. For 228 years, bicycles have been constrained by trade-offs: strength and weight, versatility and proficiency, quality and price.Today, two centuries of compromise come to a close.  Master of All TerrainsOffering versatility from pavement to pathway, the Superstrata is your ticket to the open road (and the closed ones too). A Frame Built To Fit YoursEach frame is individually crafted according to 18 precise measurements, accommodating riders from 4’7” to 7’4” (or in Metric that'd be from 1m40 to 2m20+).0 Joints + 0 Glue = 0 SplintersUnibody means unibody. Superstrata frames are fabricated using continuous carbon fiber technology and nothing else, resulting in a frame up to 61x the strength-to-weight ratio of steel.But WEIGHT, There's LessThe Superstrata frame weighs less than 1.3kg (2.9 lbs) – lighter than aluminum or 2 bottles of water.Laser-Fabricated, Hand-FinishedPrecision mastered by robots. Quality ensured by bike-loving pros. A Tour De ForceThe Superstrata is constructed using thermoplastic carbon fiber composites, a material that results in unprecedented impact resistance – making it tougher than most thermoset carbon fiber composite bikes on the market. Bespoke Down to The SpokesFully customizable in over 500,000 total combinations. Not just the components and colors, but also a frame size that's made just for you. A Frame Worth FramingEngineered in California, premiering with the first 500 units individually numbered. The Verge: Superstrata unveils ‘world’s first’ 3D-printed unibody electric bikeTechCrunch: Superstrata opens pre-orders on a pair of 3D printed bicyclesInputMag: The Superstrata Ion: Tesla’s ambition squeezed into a sick custom e-bikeCNET: Superstrata Ion is a 3D-printed, made-to-measure, carbon-fiber e-bikeTom’s Guide: This $1,499 e-bike comes custom built to perfectly suit your bodyBike Rumor: Superstrata Terra 3D prints revolutionary custom lightweight unibody carbon road bikeThe Next Web: The Superstrata ebike is made of 3D-printed carbon fiber and tailored to your bodySlash Gear: Superstrata Ion e-bike uses 3D printed carbon fiber for custom sizingWelt: Superstrata Ion und TerraPhotrip: 世界でもっとも高性能な近未来自転車と断言したいSuperstrataが誕生 / 3Dプリントで製造！ 電動も同時発売and more....  Light has found its mightYesterday’s thermoset carbon fiber frames rid the world of weight, but gave us splinters as well. We modernized the composite construction process and materials by using thermoplastic carbon fiber composites, the kind found in next generation aircraft. The result? Unprecedented impact resistance in a frame with a weight close to other high end carbon fiber bikes. There’s just one thingYes, really. True unibody design. No glue, no joints, no bolts. Just continuous carbon fiber composite that won’t splinter and construction that won’t fail. Our proprietary composite 3D-printing manufacturing technology fabricates industry-strength unibody carbon fiber frames stronger than Kevlar and lighter than 2 bottles of water. Unquestionably CustomIf a unibody bike frame that is made to accommodate your down body frame sounds too good to be true, it was. Our proprietary engineering and manufacturing processes make the improbable possible by 3D printing each frame individually according to each rider’s precise body measurements. 500,000+ Variations = 1 Unique FrameMix and match colors, wheels, handlebars, and more for a ride as unique as you are. ...More Specs For You Superstrata C - Final Build kitsSuperstrata E - Final Build kits How does the Superstrata C measure up?And the Superstrata E? Which one will be your ride? IGG Special is the price specially made available to Indiegogo members throughout this campaign.

<p>Since our last crowdfunding campaign in 2017,  we've delivered the BEST ebike kit to thousands backers, which greatly appreciated our systems for their staggering torque and impressive power.  </p>
<p>We were also frequently asked for a lighter and low cost kit. Since we don't like compromises, we accepted the challenge of designing a <strong>high performance and light ebike drive</strong>, which is super affordable. And, of course, we wanted to manufacture it in Italy. </p>
<p>The result is a state-of-the-art ebike drive system, smart, with industrial design, giving you high performance and a perfect integration with your bike.</p>

<p><strong>Bikee Bike's team</strong> is well known for high-end and high-performance ebike motors. The first product is called BEST and it's recognized for its high torque and power.  We worked to deliver the highest quality components combined with the latest IoT technologies. During the years, we've been able to develop a reliable electronics which connects our system with your phone, so that you can adjust the system parameters and eventually lock the system as antitheft prevention. </p>
<p>Since 2017, Bikee Bike has manufactured thousands of ebike kits and now has developed a cutting edge product to revolutionize the ebike market.  </p>
<p><strong>Matteo, the founder, has been a former engineer in a US corporation, </strong>which was specialized in designing and manufacturing custom electric motors. During his 6 years of activity there, he <strong>managed more than 80 projects of different electric motors</strong>, from customer specifications to mass production, for a wide variety of applications.  In the last years, he decided to focus on electric mobility since there was a market gap for a rising sector: in those years he developed with his team, among the other projects, a 60kW drivetrain for electric vans, and a 4kW drivetrain for electric mopeds . That's when he left the company to start his own engineering consultancy firm. That was dedicated to support the entrepreneurs who wanted to develop their own electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In those years, one of his friends in the ebike sector challenged him to design an ebike drivetrain with superior torque: that's when the BEST ebike kit was initially conceived. After the first publications of the project, some investors contacted Matteo for financially supporting the development of the BEST kit. It was the 2014: that's when Bikee Bike was born,</p>
<p><strong>In 2016 Bikee Bike got recognition from FORD Motor Company</strong>, <strong>getting a prize of 50'000 USD</strong> as best automotive startup in a worldwide challenge.  In the below video, the CEO of FORD, Mark Fields, chats with Matteo at CES 2016, announcing the award. That's what really kicked off the journey of Bikee Bike.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Drive Unit only weights<strong> 1.6Kg (3.5 lbs)</strong>. It's the lightest electric bicycle mid drive motor on the market. That's the weight of a bottle of water. That's awesome because you keep your bike agile in the trails, you can carry your bike with less effort on the stairs. or while loading it on your car... Or simply when you decide you want to pedal without assistance for a bit!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Mid Drive Motor</i></strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Mid drive motors</strong> are superiors comparing to hub motors because can take advantage of your bike shifter. That allows them to deliver more torque at the wheel (depending on the gear) and, for that reason, they're more efficient uphill. Just as you, pedaling with the right gear.</p>

<p>Typical e-bike motors exert the torque at the crankset. The motor torque follows the same path as the rider torque through the chain till the final sprocket at the wheel.  If the chainring is larger than the sprocket, then the speed increases and the torque is proportionally reduced and vice-versa. If you're using a rear sprocket which is larger than the chainring then you're increasing the torque at the wheel by lowering its speed. <br/>That's true also for bikes without a motor: the transmission works the same way. <br/>When e-bike mid motors made their appearance, someone decided that the motor had to exert its power directly on the crank-set. That implied the need for a consistent reduction from the motor ( which usually spins at 2000/3000 rpm) to the crank-set, that typically spins around 60/90rpm.  So the torque from the motor is greatly increased with a consistent reduction ( 20 or 30 to 1 ) by multiple gears and then, from the crank-set on the torque is decreased by the bike gears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578668807/nkaek2al34yuyfkacm3z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So if a top performing e-bike motor has 90Nm of torque at the crank, you'll feel only 30Nm (22 ft/lb) at the wheel if you're using a 36T chainring and a 12T sprocket.<br/>It's the torque at the wheel that counts. You understand that when you face a steep ascent and you shift gear to increase the torque at the wheel. The torque your muscles can exert on the pedals stays the same, just by shifting the gears you increase the torque at the wheel.<br/>Wouldn't be better to avoid that multiplication and then reduction of torque?<br/>As you probably guessed, the answer is YES.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578669415/o531tunkyjevlsrn3aks.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some asks themselves: how possibly such a small motor can compete with motors which are double the weight? Well, the answer is that we are not messing around with useless multiplication and reductions.<br/><br/><strong>That allows us to have the same torque at the wheel as a 90Nm motor, but we're getting that torque with a 30Nm motor.</strong><br/><br/>So if you were skeptical about the torque of the Lightest Drive, you were right, the torque is limited to 30Nm (22 ft/lb). But those 30Nm (22 ft/lb) will produce a the same torque at the wheel than a 90Nm (66 ft/lb)  motor. <br/><br/>Where's the catch?<br/>There no catch. Just we're not multiplying and demultiplying torque in order to match the human rpm at the crank-set.</p>
<p><strong>That's how we've been able to reduce weight to the astonishing record of 1.6Kg (3,5lbs) for the drive unit, while keeping at the same time the same effective torque as top performer ebike motors.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583761238/nd14gzg3wacecd8psska.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Regen</strong> is available on <strong>SuperHero version</strong> only. The motor is capable of converting the motion into current feeding the battery, creating a braking force.</p>
<p>In order to achieve that, the chain needs to transmit power to the motor pinion. That is usually prevented by the freewheel on the rear wheel hub. In addition, when regenerating the chain will be tensioned on the lower part rather than the upper one as it usually happens.<br/>That means that in order to achieve Regen you'll have to switch to an internally geared hub with the freewheel locked.</p>
<p>You'll take advantage of the freewheel inside the crankarm so that your pedals won't be dragged by the rear wheel. This will allow you to regenerate when pressing the brakes. Although the motor is capable of generate 10A of current ( 480W at 48V), the amount of energy you can regen depends on the battery you choose: all the batteries have a charging current limit. That's 2A for the 250Wh battery, 5A for the 550Wh and 670Wh batteries and 7A for the 840Wh battery.</p>
<p>In order to calculate how much energy you can regen, consider that 10 minutes of regen ( which can be achieved by going downhill) at 5A will give you 40Wh. That's a 7% recharge on a 550Wh battery.</p>
<p>In order to achieve REGEN, we locked the inner freewheel of the motor: for that reason, you'd feel a drag when pedaling with the motor turned off. Our suggestion to avoid that is to get a little bigger battery to make sure that we'll have a little of charge to get the motor spinning so that there won't be any drag.</p>

</div></div>","Lightest is the most advanced and light ebike kit to give superpowers to your bike, quickly.
It's designed for high performance and for longevity.  The system can be installed on any bike adding approx. 4 Kg - 8 lbs ( including the battery) . 

 
Since our last crowdfunding campaign in 2017,  we've delivered the BEST ebike kit to thousands backers, which greatly appreciated our systems for their staggering torque and impressive power.  
We were also frequently asked for a lighter and low cost kit. Since we don't like compromises, we accepted the challenge of designing a high performance and light ebike drive, which is super affordable. And, of course, we wanted to manufacture it in Italy. 
The result is a state-of-the-art ebike drive system, smart, with industrial design, giving you high performance and a perfect integration with your bike.
We're super excited to announce that we're ready to bring this high-tech beauty out to you.


 

Bikee Bike's team is well known for high-end and high-performance ebike motors. The first product is called BEST and it's recognized for its high torque and power.  We worked to deliver the highest quality components combined with the latest IoT technologies. During the years, we've been able to develop a reliable electronics which connects our system with your phone, so that you can adjust the system parameters and eventually lock the system as antitheft prevention. 
Since 2017, Bikee Bike has manufactured thousands of ebike kits and now has developed a cutting edge product to revolutionize the ebike market.  
Matteo, the founder, has been a former engineer in a US corporation, which was specialized in designing and manufacturing custom electric motors. During his 6 years of activity there, he managed more than 80 projects of different electric motors, from customer specifications to mass production, for a wide variety of applications.  In the last years, he decided to focus on electric mobility since there was a market gap for a rising sector: in those years he developed with his team, among the other projects, a 60kW drivetrain for electric vans, and a 4kW drivetrain for electric mopeds . That's when he left the company to start his own engineering consultancy firm. That was dedicated to support the entrepreneurs who wanted to develop their own electric vehicles.
In those years, one of his friends in the ebike sector challenged him to design an ebike drivetrain with superior torque: that's when the BEST ebike kit was initially conceived. After the first publications of the project, some investors contacted Matteo for financially supporting the development of the BEST kit. It was the 2014: that's when Bikee Bike was born,
In 2016 Bikee Bike got recognition from FORD Motor Company, getting a prize of 50'000 USD as best automotive startup in a worldwide challenge.  In the below video, the CEO of FORD, Mark Fields, chats with Matteo at CES 2016, announcing the award. That's what really kicked off the journey of Bikee Bike.

Bikee Bike drive systems are proudly designed, developed and manufactured in Mantua, Italy. 



Light... well the Lightest
The Drive Unit only weights 1.6Kg (3.5 lbs). It's the lightest electric bicycle mid drive motor on the market. That's the weight of a bottle of water. That's awesome because you keep your bike agile in the trails, you can carry your bike with less effort on the stairs. or while loading it on your car... Or simply when you decide you want to pedal without assistance for a bit!
 
High Performing 
Don't trade off performance for lightness: you can have them all. Power up to 1000W, equivalent torque* in excess of 90Nm (66 ft/lb).  Result: a 1.6Kg motor can tow a van ( see the following video).
 

 
Mid Drive Motor
Mid drive motors are superiors comparing to hub motors because can take advantage of your bike shifter. That allows them to deliver more torque at the wheel (depending on the gear) and, for that reason, they're more efficient uphill. Just as you, pedaling with the right gear.

 
Silent
In this video you can appreciate the motor sound during operation. We left the raw footage so that you can compare the sound of the rope against the wheel with the motor sound.
 

 
 
Torque sensor for a natural feel
Direct torque sensing system gives you true feeling of the bike, making the ride a very natural experience.


Smartphone connected 

You can connect your system with your smartphone with two different configurations: standard ( see display section) and Superhero ( see Superhero app section).  The standard version allows you to visualize and control the assistance with your Heart Rate. The Superhero will unlock a world of possibilities. 

 
Outstanding Ground Clearance
Improved capability of overcoming obstacles without damaging the motor.

 
Heart Sensor Assist 
With the HRM feature, just set the BPM you'd like to keep and the assistance level will be adjusted automatically to keep that on track. See video in the display section. 

 
And much more!


 
 




 

AffordableThe launch price is 499 Euro (549 USD) for the complete kit with the 250Wh battery. That is an amazing price for a real mid drive system which is Made in Italy. 



Extremely CompactOverall dimensions are 85x90x128mm (3,3 x 3,5 x 5 inch); That allows a clean installation on your bike for a motor that fits in one hand.





 


Retrofit kit or OEM componentYou can install the Lightest e-bike Drive Unit on your existing bike to make it electric.
Otherwise, if you own a bike company, you can create a custom frame for seamless integration. We can provide adapting plates to match the motor with existing OEM frames made for the most common ebike motor brands.





 

DurableIn order to get such a weight reduction, we use premium components. Aluminum alloy shields with extra-large cooling fins for optimal heat dissipation, case hardened steel gears, premium silicone steel to name a few.




 


Quick Release 
Take the motor off in just 5 minutes: only two bolts lock the motor in place. Use your motor when you feel it and take it down when you want to. With two sets of mounting plates you can power alternatively two bikes. If you use two chain quick links, you'll do it even better!




Independent drive pinionGives you the opportunity to have different transmission ratios between human power and motor power. In addition the inner freewheel will give you ZERO DRAG when OFF.

 


Perfect chainlineKeep the same chainline as on your original bike. You won't have any problem with bad alignment or chain that falls off.


 
 




 

Easy and quick installationConverts your bike into a pedal-assisted bicycle in few minutes. 




Wide Battery choicePick the battery you deserve! They are ranging from 250Wh up to 840Wh, from 30 up to 180km (from 19 to 112 miles) and are made with premium Samsung cells.
You can choose between different configurations: bottle battery, rear rack or backpack!
See the dedicated section below for details. After selecting a perk, you can upgrade your battery in the checkout section.




Anti-theft Lock (Superhero version only)You can lock your system with your smartphone so that it will be useless if stolen. Your unique PIN number will make you the only one to control it.

 


KERS - regen braking (on request)The system will be able to use the braking energy to charge the battery. This will be possible only with fixed gear on internally geared hubs.

You'll be also able to select additional accessories ( for instance if you got a Couple kit Perk and you want the Superhero version on both, you'll be able to ask for the second one in that survey.
 

 
This configuration is perfect for most of bikes: city bikes, front MTBs, full suspension MTB with straight downtube, gravel bikes.
The drive unit is mounted below the downtube, the mounting plates integrate the chain guide. The torque-sensing feature is preserved and there will only be one chain on the bike.
You can download the drawing of this configuration: by printing the image in 1:1 scale ( please refer to the dimension indication on the drawing to verify the scale) you can check whether this configuration works with your bike. Download the drawing here.
 
 

This configuration is indicated when your frame doesn't allow you to use the Standard Mount or when you want to have a double chainring. 
The drive unit is mounted below the downtube, the mounting plates are very short.
The torque-sensing feature is not active and there will be two chains on the bike: the first chain for transmitting the power from the motor to the crank, the second one for transmitting the power from the crank to the wheel. Because of that, you can mount three chainrings and dedicate two of them to the crank-to-wheel transmission.

Five configurations to get exactly what you need to give superpowers to your standard bike, whatever it is. 

*Equivalent torque gives you the opportunity to compare the Lightest torque with conventional ebike motors, which have their output at the bike's bottom bracket. Equivalent torque is the torque that a conventional ebike motor should exert at the bottom bracket in order to get the same wheel torque as the Lightest system. Not enough clear? Check the further explanation. 
*Average Battery Range is estimated on flat and paved ground, on a mountain bike with a 70kg (154lbs) rider and assistance from the motor around 200W. 
*EARLY BIRD PRICES are limited to 50 units per each perk. After those 50 units will be purchased, please select the standard version.


Lightest complete kit also includes a Li-ion Battery with genuine Samsung cells. We coupled different batteries with the four power versions of the kit, but it's also possible to receive only the motor and its mounting accessories, without battery. Here the standard combos:

Full Battery Tech Specs
 


Typical e-bike motors exert the torque at the crankset. The motor torque follows the same path as the rider torque through the chain till the final sprocket at the wheel.  If the chainring is larger than the sprocket, then the speed increases and the torque is proportionally reduced and vice-versa. If you're using a rear sprocket which is larger than the chainring then you're increasing the torque at the wheel by lowering its speed. That's true also for bikes without a motor: the transmission works the same way. When e-bike mid motors made their appearance, someone decided that the motor had to exert its power directly on the crank-set. That implied the need for a consistent reduction from the motor ( which usually spins at 2000/3000 rpm) to the crank-set, that typically spins around 60/90rpm.  So the torque from the motor is greatly increased with a consistent reduction ( 20 or 30 to 1 ) by multiple gears and then, from the crank-set on the torque is decreased by the bike gears.
 

 
So if a top performing e-bike motor has 90Nm of torque at the crank, you'll feel only 30Nm (22 ft/lb) at the wheel if you're using a 36T chainring and a 12T sprocket.It's the torque at the wheel that counts. You understand that when you face a steep ascent and you shift gear to increase the torque at the wheel. The torque your muscles can exert on the pedals stays the same, just by shifting the gears you increase the torque at the wheel.Wouldn't be better to avoid that multiplication and then reduction of torque?As you probably guessed, the answer is YES.
 

 
Some asks themselves: how possibly such a small motor can compete with motors which are double the weight? Well, the answer is that we are not messing around with useless multiplication and reductions.That allows us to have the same torque at the wheel as a 90Nm motor, but we're getting that torque with a 30Nm motor.So if you were skeptical about the torque of the Lightest Drive, you were right, the torque is limited to 30Nm (22 ft/lb). But those 30Nm (22 ft/lb) will produce a the same torque at the wheel than a 90Nm (66 ft/lb)  motor. Where's the catch?There no catch. Just we're not multiplying and demultiplying torque in order to match the human rpm at the crank-set.
That's how we've been able to reduce weight to the astonishing record of 1.6Kg (3,5lbs) for the drive unit, while keeping at the same time the same effective torque as top performer ebike motors.

Regen is available on SuperHero version only. The motor is capable of converting the motion into current feeding the battery, creating a braking force.
In order to achieve that, the chain needs to transmit power to the motor pinion. That is usually prevented by the freewheel on the rear wheel hub. In addition, when regenerating the chain will be tensioned on the lower part rather than the upper one as it usually happens.That means that in order to achieve Regen you'll have to switch to an internally geared hub with the freewheel locked.
You'll take advantage of the freewheel inside the crankarm so that your pedals won't be dragged by the rear wheel. This will allow you to regenerate when pressing the brakes. Although the motor is capable of generate 10A of current ( 480W at 48V), the amount of energy you can regen depends on the battery you choose: all the batteries have a charging current limit. That's 2A for the 250Wh battery, 5A for the 550Wh and 670Wh batteries and 7A for the 840Wh battery.
In order to calculate how much energy you can regen, consider that 10 minutes of regen ( which can be achieved by going downhill) at 5A will give you 40Wh. That's a 7% recharge on a 550Wh battery.
In order to achieve REGEN, we locked the inner freewheel of the motor: for that reason, you'd feel a drag when pedaling with the motor turned off. Our suggestion to avoid that is to get a little bigger battery to make sure that we'll have a little of charge to get the motor spinning so that there won't be any drag.

Creating a cutting edge technology always brings risks . We have been facing them for the past years but our expertise and strong team, made us overtook them.

We faced the skeptics who didn’t think what we wanted to do was possible. It always happens when the technology is disruptive. We had our share of satisfaction make them try the finished products and compliment us.
Now the feeling you get riding a bike with our motor, is something not easy to be explained. 
We know in detail all the technologies available and how to implement them in a production line in order to cut costs because of our experience in motor manufacturing.
All the 3D drawings for parts and molds are ready. Suppliers have been selected and tested for quality. All the machineries we will need, already have been negotiated and designed for our specific needs.
All is in place to start manufacturing, all we need is a first batch big enough to keep the initial cost acceptable and to make the downpayment for moulds and toolings.
We are aware that having many different suppliers to work together might be not easy and lead to some production delays. Knowing this and having manufacturing experts in our team, we will try to avoid and anticipate all the possible problems and respect all the deadlines.",97.0,5,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>It’s a cold Monday morning. You have an important meeting and you cannot miss it. You start your car and shift into reverse. The engine revs but you go nowhere; your transmission has just given out! You are experiencing the invisible, multi-billion-dollar problem faced by drivers every day—a problem Big Oil hopes you will ignore.</p>
<p>Transmission or gearbox failure is often the <span>bitter end</span> for cars and trucks. Millions end up in the junkyard every year when they wear out or become too costly to maintain. The environmental impact alone is staggering, and for you it means the sudden death of a daily driver or a timeless classic.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We have a small solution for this big problem.</h3>
<p>We offer <span>diamond-like armor</span> to protect all kinds of engines and machines from the perils of friction. Our treatments are simple to apply and activate while you drive. The armor activates at the highest friction points, fills in worn spots, and leaves an ultra-low friction surface. This gives you a better running vehicle and added insurance against transmission failure. </p>

The grippy side reinforces and strengthens by binding to engine surfaces, exposing the slippery side to fight friction. This killer combination reduces friction so low, there's a term for it—superlubricity.</p><p> </p><div data-caption=""Superlubricity: friction coefficient &lt; 0.01"" data-id=""27794453""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1581109584/exx1wngxlzlwymnuviqp.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Superlubricity: friction coefficient &lt; 0.01</i></p></figcaption></figure></div><p> </p><p>TriboTEX nanoparticles only <strong>activate under high heat and pressure</strong>, so they aren’t wasted on surfaces that don’t generate friction. Instead, they intelligently self-align into a super-strong lattice structure on top of compromised surfaces, compensating for years of wear, thereby REVERSING WEAR ™. The treatment’s smart activation puts the coating only where it’s needed without affecting clutches or solenoids. TriboTEX is also <strong>non-toxic, biocompatible, </strong>and <strong>environmentally safe</strong>.</p><p>After an activation period, which takes roughly 500 miles in a normal vehicle, the critical components of the gearbox are coated with a porous, lubricious tribofilm (tribo means friction) boasting excellent embeddability and oil retention. The slippery surface contains select catalysts, added to accelerate the formation of a <span>Diamond-Like Carbon</span> (DLC) cap on top.</p><p>When you invest in our protective products, your money is used to improve our lubricants and develop new products for all sorts of machines.

TriboTEX Transmission: Power + Endurance
We changed the crowdfunding game with our award-winning engine treatment. Now, we're ready to disrupt the automotive market again with TriboTEX Transmission, a powerful drop-in treatment that protects and reverses wear in your drivetrain with nanoparticles, so you can have peace of mind that your vehicle will be there for you when you need it most.
 

available EXCLUSIVELY on Indiegogo
 
Experience unparalleled power and an endurance boost with a drop-in treatment that’s quicker than checking your oil. We designed this advanced technology to repair damaged bearings and gears, and protect the most precise and delicate components of gearboxes with diamond-like armor.  
 
TriboTEX Transmission (not a rendering, actual product)
 
With a single application, TriboTEX Transmission will protect and improve your vehicle for thousands of miles. Made in the USA and developed with the support of the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and NASA.
 
 
Take advantage of the following benefits for your vehicles:

Dramatically extend the life of at-risk metals in your transmission
Reduce heat generated by friction thus extending the life of your lubricant
Deliver more energy to the wheels rather than wasting it on cooling
Boost and protect your towing capacity
Defend your transmission from shock loads during towing and rough shifting 

 
 
Taking Flight
Aviation-grade lube hasn't changed since the '70s—not since M*A*S*H was on the air. We want to change that.
 
Your dollar is doubled by a matching grant from the U.S. Air Force
 
Since the beginning, our company set its sights on flight. With the help of the United States Air Force, we're bringing our wear-reversing nanotechnology to flying machines. If successfully funded, our project will be matched with a Phase II SBIR grant to achieve the major milestone of FAA certification. That means, your dollar gets us twice as close to the dream of aviation applications for our wear-reversing nanoparticles.

The engine revs but you move nowhere...
car trouble
 
It’s a cold Monday morning. You have an important meeting and you cannot miss it. You start your car and shift into reverse. The engine revs but you go nowhere; your transmission has just given out! You are experiencing the invisible, multi-billion-dollar problem faced by drivers every day—a problem Big Oil hopes you will ignore.
Transmission or gearbox failure is often the bitter end for cars and trucks. Millions end up in the junkyard every year when they wear out or become too costly to maintain. The environmental impact alone is staggering, and for you it means the sudden death of a daily driver or a timeless classic.
 
We have a small solution for this big problem.
We offer diamond-like armor to protect all kinds of engines and machines from the perils of friction. Our treatments are simple to apply and activate while you drive. The armor activates at the highest friction points, fills in worn spots, and leaves an ultra-low friction surface. This gives you a better running vehicle and added insurance against transmission failure. 
 
Diamond-Like Armor for Your Transmission
 

Protect Your Hotrod or Classic Car
 
 
 
 
The Technology
TriboTEX is pioneering a new landscape of lubrication technology. We can reverse wear in your transmission in as little as 15 minutes! Our dual-sided nanoparticles activate under the high heat and pressure present during normal operation. 
 

TriboTEX Anisotropic Dual-Sided Nanoparticles These powerful little particles are anisotropic, meaning they are different in different directions and have two functionally different sides; one side binds, and the other glides. The grippy side reinforces and strengthens by binding to engine surfaces, exposing the slippery side to fight friction. This killer combination reduces friction so low, there's a term for it—superlubricity. Superlubricity: friction coefficient < 0.01 TriboTEX nanoparticles only activate under high heat and pressure, so they aren’t wasted on surfaces that don’t generate friction. Instead, they intelligently self-align into a super-strong lattice structure on top of compromised surfaces, compensating for years of wear, thereby REVERSING WEAR ™. The treatment’s smart activation puts the coating only where it’s needed without affecting clutches or solenoids. TriboTEX is also non-toxic, biocompatible, and environmentally safe.After an activation period, which takes roughly 500 miles in a normal vehicle, the critical components of the gearbox are coated with a porous, lubricious tribofilm (tribo means friction) boasting excellent embeddability and oil retention. The slippery surface contains select catalysts, added to accelerate the formation of a Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) cap on top.When you invest in our protective products, your money is used to improve our lubricants and develop new products for all sorts of machines. Your investment also goes toward improving lubrication standards for military, transit, and infrastructure. We recently received an esteemed Air Force research grant to re-engineer gearbox lubricants for helicopters, which can ultimately save lives.Read more on our Science page.   
 
Who We Are
TriboTEX is a technology company developing smart nanomaterials to prevent wear, reduce friction, and repair machinery. Our products improve the efficiency and lifetime of industrial machines and combustion engines.
 The Palouse Based in the beautiful Palouse region of the Northwest United States, we take advantage of our close proximity to two research institutions. Washington State University and the University of Idaho. We're proud to research, develop, and manufacture all in the USA. For a deeper look at our company history, see the Milestones section below.   Our BackgroundTen years ago, Dr. Pasha Rudenko met with industry executives to show how his research in tribology (the study of lubrication) could solve important problems facing our world. They responded that life-extending technologies simply don't help corporate profits. Determined to bring his technology to the people, Dr. Rudenko set out on his own. TriboTEX was born, and with the success of our first Kickstarter tens of thousands of people have joined the cause for superior lubrication that makes our machines last longer and run more efficiently. Dr. Pasha Rudenko, Ph.D.—Founder & CTO         It took thirty years of combined experience, extensive research at universities and national labs, and a dedicated team to bring TriboTEX to you. If it was not for the thousands of people who first adopted our groundbreaking technology, we would not have made it this far. That investment has paid off, and we estimate our treatments have saved hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel and kept countless daily drivers, work vehicles, and classic cars running smoothly and safely.   
 
How to Use Instructions vary by vehicle, but most automatic transmissions allow you to easily apply TriboTEX Transmission through the dipstick tube. You may also ask a mechanic to treat your vehicle by any shop the next time you have your fluids checked.  
 
STEP 1: Warm up your engine, then shut it off. Driving for 15 minutes is recommended.
 
 
STEP 2: Locate your transmission dipstick and remove it. Always check your fluid levels regularly. The volume of the treatment is small enough not to affect your fluid level.  
 
STEP 3: Add the entire treatment, put the dipstick back, close the hood and continue to drive normally.
 
 
STEP 4: Drive normally. The treatment fully activates after about 500 miles of driving.

<h2><strong>How was Kobra born? </strong></h2>
<p>Our Kobra was born from the need to face the city jungle in a safe and agile way.  After months of first-hand experiences with electric kick scooters, on city and hilly streets, we realized that there was no model capable of guaranteeing survival in this jungle ;).</p>
<p>The core objective was therefore to give more security to our scooter trips, in fact the Kobra is designed to guarantee the highest standards of safety and stability thanks to the wide radius front wheel and to the double disc brake combined with an electronic brake.</p>
<p>But these are only a few if its characteristics. The body of the Kobra has an exclusive and elegant design, inspired by the frames of motorcycles.  A tubular structure guarantees stability and flexibility which together with SAE 304 stainless steel ensure the highest resistance.  It is therefore designed to withstand the most extreme conditions and with its exclusive geometry it also has a large integrated cushioning effect.</p>
<p>And, Kobra technology goes much further!</p>
<p>It is designed to guarantee a driving experience that never ends. E-ABS assistance, combined with the Adaptive Cruise Control, take you wherever you want.</p>
<p><strong>E-ABS</strong></p>
<p>First of all, safety.</p>
<p>The anti-lock system of the tire allows you to stop with maximum stability, even in the event of emergency braking.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Cruise Control</strong></p>
<p>The innovative Cruise Control is able to keep the set speed constant, independently adapting the amount of power needed on the flat, uphill and downhill, while recharging the battery.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Regen System</strong></p>
<p>Through the electronic brake, the battery regenerate its charge while driving, only by releasing the throttle.  Distances won't stop you anymore!</p>
<p>All of this, was only possible thanks to the help of a partner company, leader for more than 10 years in the field of electric mobility for people with disabilities. Deciding to share its knowhow, gave us the opportunity to guarantee a very high quality product with a technology extensively tested for years by more than 15,000 users worldwide and with more than 38,400 hours of research and development behind it.</p>

</div></div>","How was Kobra born? 
Our Kobra was born from the need to face the city jungle in a safe and agile way.  After months of first-hand experiences with electric kick scooters, on city and hilly streets, we realized that there was no model capable of guaranteeing survival in this jungle ;).
The core objective was therefore to give more security to our scooter trips, in fact the Kobra is designed to guarantee the highest standards of safety and stability thanks to the wide radius front wheel and to the double disc brake combined with an electronic brake.
But these are only a few if its characteristics. The body of the Kobra has an exclusive and elegant design, inspired by the frames of motorcycles.  A tubular structure guarantees stability and flexibility which together with SAE 304 stainless steel ensure the highest resistance.  It is therefore designed to withstand the most extreme conditions and with its exclusive geometry it also has a large integrated cushioning effect.
And, Kobra technology goes much further!
It is designed to guarantee a driving experience that never ends. E-ABS assistance, combined with the Adaptive Cruise Control, take you wherever you want.
E-ABS
First of all, safety.
The anti-lock system of the tire allows you to stop with maximum stability, even in the event of emergency braking.
Adaptive Cruise Control
The innovative Cruise Control is able to keep the set speed constant, independently adapting the amount of power needed on the flat, uphill and downhill, while recharging the battery.
Automatic Regen System
Through the electronic brake, the battery regenerate its charge while driving, only by releasing the throttle.  Distances won't stop you anymore!
All of this, was only possible thanks to the help of a partner company, leader for more than 10 years in the field of electric mobility for people with disabilities. Deciding to share its knowhow, gave us the opportunity to guarantee a very high quality product with a technology extensively tested for years by more than 15,000 users worldwide and with more than 38,400 hours of research and development behind it.

<h1><b>Biktrix over-delivers.</b></h1>
<p>Our 2014 crowdfunding campaign for the Biktrix Juggernaut was successful (<a href=""http://kck.st/14iX1JC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://kck.st/14iX1JC</a>). We over-delivered on every one of the 42 bikes ordered through the campaign. Specifically:</p>
<h3><b>We delivered on schedule:</b></h3>
<p>Every single Biktrix Juggernaut was delivered. 50% were well ahead of schedule, and the last bike was delivered on May 30, 2015. We had bumps along the way, and we spent a lot of long, hard days and nights working to solve them efficiently to keep things on schedule. We are very proud of this, and wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<h3><b>We delivered top quality:</b></h3>
<p>Every Biktrix Juggernaut delivered was meticulously tested before shipping. We did run into a few quality problems, such as blown motor controllers, defective battery management systems, broken forks, scratched frames, and we caught and solved these <b>prior</b> to delivery. The Juggernauts we delivered were top-notch, high-quality machines, and all our backers are really happy with the quality. All of them agree that they got <b>more</b> than what they asked for or expected.</p>
<h3><b>We delivered outstanding support:</b></h3>
<p>Since delivery, we have received 20 support requests from Juggernaut owners, and have replied to them all the same day - mostly within minutes! Most of this has been advice and recommendations - you know, friendly enthusiast banter. But, we did have a couple of real warranty issues (problems with 2 of the forks), which we sorted out at no extra cost (we shipped new ones for free to the backer's local bike shop that did the installation) and promptly (both cases were solved within a couple of days).</p>
<h3><b>We delivered more! </b></h3>
<p>The Juggernaut was delivered with a <b>lot</b> of free upgrades - not just stickers and T-shirts, but real stuff that matters. We upgraded the motor from the originally promised 500W version to a 750W beast. Then we upgraded the brakes, seat, handlebars, and rims. And to keep our customers clean and dry in the rain, we tossed in free fenders for every one of our backers.</p>
<p>We consider the Juggernaut a success - not because it got funded, but because we delighted every single customer.</p>

<h1></h1>
<h1 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>More details</b></h1>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The heart of the Stunner is its <b>powerful mid-drive motor and high quality battery.</b><br/><br/>Mid-drive motors have several advantages over standard hub drive motors. <br/></span><ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The weight is evenly distributed along the center of the bike. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Mid-drives are more efficient than hub motors by using the <br/>drive-train (gears) of the bike as the motor's transmission. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1215029/files/20150211130835-BBs02.png?1423688915"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Powerful</b></h3>
The <b style=""font-weight: normal;"">500W</b> rated (900W peak) crank motor is greater than 80% efficient <br/>and gives you plenty of power and torque to climb up any incline. The mid motor uses the gears of your bike as its transmission. This enables the motor to climb up any hill seamlessly.<br/><br/><h3><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">No drag</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Since our motor freewheels about the crank, there is <b>no unnecessary drag</b>. <br/>If your battery dies, just pedal the Stunner like a regular bike.</span>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Three operation modes</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1214851/files/20150211121748-modes.png?1423685868"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><h3><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Worry-free, maintenance-free, removable battery</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The built-in <b>state-of-the-art Battery Management</b> System (BMS) allows you to leave the battery plugged in as long as you want. The BMS will intelligently cut off supply to individual cells.</span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448517178/jhxhleup7s4uh4dxqgxb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/></span><h3><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Open platform<br/></b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Built on an open platform</b>, the Stunner allows the owner to swap its complete electric system to any other bike with basic bike tools (*compatible with 90% of bikes). The open platform also allows you to opt for any 36V battery. We are not interested in trying to tie you in with a proprietary battery that costs a lot to replace.<br/><br/></span><div>
<div>
<h3><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Great aftermarket support</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Stunner uses the popular Bafang mid-mount BBS02 motor. This motor is very durable and has been around for a long time. It even has great aftermarket support for upgrades.</span>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
</div>
<h3>Light, Simple, yet Powerful braking</h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>Quality rim brakes can perform just as good if not better than their mechanical disc brake counterparts. The Stunner is equipped with the absolute best v-brakes in the market. Reviews on this brake can be found<a href=""http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/ca/en/swissstop-rx-plus-brake-pads-shimano-xtr-xt/rp-prod42655"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> here</a>.

</div></div>","Biktrix over-delivers.
Our 2014 crowdfunding campaign for the Biktrix Juggernaut was successful (http://kck.st/14iX1JC). We over-delivered on every one of the 42 bikes ordered through the campaign. Specifically:
We delivered on schedule:
Every single Biktrix Juggernaut was delivered. 50% were well ahead of schedule, and the last bike was delivered on May 30, 2015. We had bumps along the way, and we spent a lot of long, hard days and nights working to solve them efficiently to keep things on schedule. We are very proud of this, and wouldn't have it any other way.
We delivered top quality:
Every Biktrix Juggernaut delivered was meticulously tested before shipping. We did run into a few quality problems, such as blown motor controllers, defective battery management systems, broken forks, scratched frames, and we caught and solved these prior to delivery. The Juggernauts we delivered were top-notch, high-quality machines, and all our backers are really happy with the quality. All of them agree that they got more than what they asked for or expected.
We delivered outstanding support:
Since delivery, we have received 20 support requests from Juggernaut owners, and have replied to them all the same day - mostly within minutes! Most of this has been advice and recommendations - you know, friendly enthusiast banter. But, we did have a couple of real warranty issues (problems with 2 of the forks), which we sorted out at no extra cost (we shipped new ones for free to the backer's local bike shop that did the installation) and promptly (both cases were solved within a couple of days).
We delivered more! 
The Juggernaut was delivered with a lot of free upgrades - not just stickers and T-shirts, but real stuff that matters. We upgraded the motor from the originally promised 500W version to a 750W beast. Then we upgraded the brakes, seat, handlebars, and rims. And to keep our customers clean and dry in the rain, we tossed in free fenders for every one of our backers.
We consider the Juggernaut a success - not because it got funded, but because we delighted every single customer.

Biktrix is back to over-deliver again with our latest model, the Stunner.
 The Stunner is born to please.

Review by EBR




More details

The heart of the Stunner is its powerful mid-drive motor and high quality battery.Mid-drive motors have several advantages over standard hub drive motors. 
The weight is evenly distributed along the center of the bike. 

Mid-drives are more efficient than hub motors by using the drive-train (gears) of the bike as the motor's transmission. 




Powerful
The 500W rated (900W peak) crank motor is greater than 80% efficient and gives you plenty of power and torque to climb up any incline. The mid motor uses the gears of your bike as its transmission. This enables the motor to climb up any hill seamlessly.No drag
Since our motor freewheels about the crank, there is no unnecessary drag. If your battery dies, just pedal the Stunner like a regular bike.


Three operation modes

Worry-free, maintenance-free, removable battery
The built-in state-of-the-art Battery Management System (BMS) allows you to leave the battery plugged in as long as you want. The BMS will intelligently cut off supply to individual cells.



Open platform
Built on an open platform, the Stunner allows the owner to swap its complete electric system to any other bike with basic bike tools (*compatible with 90% of bikes). The open platform also allows you to opt for any 36V battery. We are not interested in trying to tie you in with a proprietary battery that costs a lot to replace.

Great aftermarket support
The Stunner uses the popular Bafang mid-mount BBS02 motor. This motor is very durable and has been around for a long time. It even has great aftermarket support for upgrades.


Light, Simple, yet Powerful braking


Quality rim brakes can perform just as good if not better than their mechanical disc brake counterparts. The Stunner is equipped with the absolute best v-brakes in the market. Reviews on this brake can be found here. These brakes are really easy to maintain and service. Replacement parts can be found easily and are very inexpensive.

SwissStop brake pads deliver more than just great stopping power. They provide superior modulation and feel on all types of brake surfaces from Aluminium to carbon.
Our rubber compounds are the foundation for our line of brake pads. Special formulas have been developed for Aluminium and carbon wheels. Decades of experience stand behind every SwissStop product.
Features:

Top performance on dry rims and even better performance on wet
Complete absence of abrasive materials which damage rims
Consistent braking (-20°C to +40°C)

<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>We will directly be<strong> doubling the income of 1M bus driver crews across Africa,</strong> by increasing the number of trips they can make each day by making the transportation system more efficient, Magic Bus is created to have impact on everyone using the system, from the drivers to the riders, to urban planners.</p>
<p>Commuters will no longer have to wait long periods of times to get their buses, they can conveniently book their tickets through SMS , allowing them to better plan their day and <strong>access better services like jobs, education, and healthcare </strong>currently out of their reach. The majority of us now accept Uber and Lyft as easy and convenient ways to get around cities, but for underserved markets these technologies exclusively rely on the use of smartphones.</p>
<p>We are the <strong>first tech for transport solution to specifically target low income markets</strong>, to provide them with <strong>dignified and reliable transport through SMS</strong>--which means <strong>we can change the world of the 200M people </strong>relying on informal transport systems!  </p>
<p>By making transportation more affordable and predictable, we will also incentivize people who currently walk to take public buses, decreasing congestion in the long term and creating sustainability in cities. </p>
<h2>Our Track Record</h2>
<ul><li>We have already <u><strong>raised $18k</strong></u> which we used to fly to Kenya, develop the tech platform, take the prototype  to the market and do <u>beta testing of the technology </u>with customers. </li></ul>

Commuters will no longer have to wait long periods of times to get their buses, they can conveniently book their tickets through SMS , allowing them to better plan their day and access better services like jobs, education, and healthcare currently out of their reach. The majority of us now accept Uber and Lyft as easy and convenient ways to get around cities, but for underserved markets these technologies exclusively rely on the use of smartphones.
We are the first tech for transport solution to specifically target low income markets, to provide them with dignified and reliable transport through SMS--which means we can change the world of the 200M people relying on informal transport systems!  
By making transportation more affordable and predictable, we will also incentivize people who currently walk to take public buses, decreasing congestion in the long term and creating sustainability in cities. 
Our Track Record
We have already raised $18k which we used to fly to Kenya, develop the tech platform, take the prototype  to the market and do beta testing of the technology with customers. 


We won $10k in Nairobi's Transdev transportation tech competition, to be awarded at the end of September 
Help us raise the next round of funding for us to continue with the second phase of the pilot!

Removing the need for a 4th tire and suspension kit as well as a steering linkage helps lower the selling point of our vehicles. In addition to this, our vehicle experiences less loading when compared to a 4 wheel vehicle due to the fact that a 3 wheeled vehicle offers equal ground pressure on all of its tires regardless of operating conditions. A 4 wheel vehicle sees a lot of torsion when 1 of its tires enters a rut while a 3 wheel vehicle distributes the loads accordingly.

Farmers (or dedicated rental businesses) can also rent out the vehicle’s services to other farmers to earn more money while boosting the productivity of other farms. A smallholder farmer with no way to irrigate his crops could rent an AgRover and pump water to boost his/her field’s yield.

Surfwheel is a revolutionary electric skateboard. Our team has extensively researched on how to develop a patent pending wheel that mimics the act of surfing on land. We've partnered with Warners Bros. to bring you the superhero SU versions. Surfwheel brings the ocean waves and the mountain snow to you! Feel the rush of surfing a wave or boarding down a mountain just by walking out of your front door.
 
""Feel the sensation of on land surfing. The rider on the video did not make turn movement but slightly apply pressure to drift the board from left to right and from right to left. There is no need to use a remote control to control speed. Your body motion determines the speed for acceleration or stop. Surfwheel is the world closet electric vehicle that mimics the act of Surfing on land."", Ondy


Coolest riding experience ever
Surfwheel SU allows you to use your body motion to accelerate and stop. The unique tire tread is designed to simulate surfing, giving you the thrill of on-land surfing. The full color LED light enables you to show off every move of yours at night.



Carry with you to surf around the city
Easily carry the 8kg (17lb.) lightweight Surfwheel SU around the city. A single charge of Surfwheel SU supports up to 15km (9m) distance ride. Bring an extra battery and surf non-stop for the whole day.




 


Safest ride on Surfwheel SU
Equipped with anti-fall front/rear assisted wheels and auto-switch on/stop feature, Surfwheel SU provides a safe and fun ride.



Reinventing the Wheel for On Land Surfing
Over the past two years, our team has extensively researched on how to develop a wheel that mimics the act of surfing on land. Our patent-pending design includes:

Unique tire tread pattern and radius
BMX bicycle tire radius
Hard rubber tire provides durability and fail-proof ride
Assisted Stabilizing


We've partnered with Warners Bros. to bring you the superhero SU versions or alternatively you can choose from our original Surfwheel SU black or blue version.
  

Surfwheeling is a sport! Wear protective gear at all times. It's easy to learn but requires practice to master. Use the motion of your body to control - lean forward to move and lean sideways to stop. Follow your intuition to move and swing just like you do while surfing.




How to start

Wear protective gear before you start.
Step on one side of Surfwheel. Then, put another foot on the Press button.
Surfwheel will be initialized and you can start your ride. When you ride, your foot must remain on the Press button.


 



How to stop
Lean sideways 30 degrees to stop or remove your foot from the Press button for over 2 seconds.


 




Connect to App
The Surfwheel App is available for Android and IOS. Use the Surfwheel App to update firmware, check your battery status, adjust the LED color, and track your speed.

 



Please support us
We need your support to bring Surfwheel SU to the market.



USD399/499
Surfwheel SU MSRP is USD529 (Black/Blue)/USD599(Character version). Support us to bring the Surfwheel SU to the market with up to 40% discount. We are giving all surfwheelers surfwheel tshirts.

We want to take you on a journey with us. A unique journey of redefining urban transport. We are calling this journey EleCa. It is an exercise in renewables, a fun journey and a product that should revolutionise urban transport.And, you can be a part of it, by selecting a PERK or by joining the ""Influence Team"" and help us defining our new and revolutionary EV! Based on early feedback, we recommend you place your deposit on one of the early deliveries. Check PERKS on your right-hand side of this page.You would be joining a working group made up of amanoauto executives who for the last 5 years have been building and assisting in the builds of EVs as well as a team of UTS students with background and keen interest in EV's, rallies, robotics, autonomous driving and design.We welcome you to be a part of this exciting and innovative initiative. Background Research
According to a survey conducted by the US Department of Transport, an average driver covers 47 kms (27 miles) a day (https://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov...). Another survey carried-out at the European Environment Agency shows that there are rarely more than 2 persons in a car (http://www.eea.europe.eu/data-and-maps/indicato...).Research Comments
 
""Outstandingly futuristic design, shape is energy saving, less loss of energy, three wheel so less friction. Will buy if less than $10,000"".
""Nice design, nice shape, nice to see. Opening hatch cool. Very modern. Maybe needs a bit more speed than 50km/h. Good price if less than $10 000. SDC. Probably would buy"".
""Needs some sort of a window to see out when sitting in the back. So window design important. Needs a storage room. Would buy.""Comment from EleCa Team - All glass roof ""dome"" means there are no visibility issues!

""Design is futuristic, bit too much. Clashes a bit with the current trends in vehicles because its too futuristic design. Very different from todayʼs cars. If itʼs autonomous then fits its futuristic design better and people would perhaps want it more.""
""Good aerodynamics. Probably would buy it.""
Advantages

Lighter, wind-cheating, lower drag and tear-drop shape.
2 models - One motorised cycle categorisation. The launch model of the EleCa fits the quadricycle category in Europe. The three-wheel format allows us to categorise it as a motorised cycle in those countries and territories (like Australia) where the quadricycle category does not exist; one that will arrive later, a relatively unlimited speed model for those that prefer a full-feature vehicle.
Following much research and development, we believe that we have come-up with a vehicle and a design that is fun, functional, cost-effective to acquire and run, for many years of fun transportation. 
 DisclaimerThe final production EleCa. might look marginally different from our conceptual designs in order to meet legislation requirements. Project Timeline
EleCa Prototype Roadshow
Technical Specifications
 We are making the ignition key obsolete
Instead use your device to:
Access your vehicle
Check the status of the various parameters of your EleCA.
Precondition your EleCA for creature comfort.
Stay informed of your charge status and where the next charging station is.
Be alarmed should your EleCA sense any danger while you're away.
Check speed and other driving parameters.
(you shall also get a plastic card should you or anybody with your permission, require access to the EleCa.
 Remote Control
Your Android or iPhone device becomes a golden trove of information about your EleCa.Entry and starter keys are now a thing of the past. Access to your EleCa is optionallyavailable through your handheld device as are the key statistics and travel information.Speed, driving-time, charge status and other key statistics are readily available on yourdevice that has a specific holding bay on the dash board.Even when you leave the EleCa, it will automatically lock and keep it at your pre-settemperature to avoid you entering the vehicle when it feels like an oven. As you get to yourdestination, you’re able to monitor your car statistics like charging status remotely as well asbe alarmed of any tempering. You’re also able to follow or immobilise (where allowed bythe local roads authority) your vehicle in the unlikely event that will get stolen. EleServ
Electric cars are known for their reliability. Unlike combustion engine powered vehicles, EV's do not have complex engines with complex and regular service requirements. All that drives the EleCa is a refined but simple electric motor and lithium batteries. Not much to go wrong there!Furthermore, consumable items like brake pads last a lot longer as the EleCa utilises regenerative breaking to slow down the vehicle. So, in 80% of the cases, the mechanical brakes are not being utilised, making the brake pads last about five times longer.However, the unimaginable can always happen and should you have any issues, EleServ is always on standby through our handheld app pre-empting a break-down or ready to assist you should something go wrong. The first support stage of EleServ is remote diagnosis and repairs wherever possible. The second stage is scheduling pre diagnosed repairs at our premises. EleCa will have a service centre in every country it sells vehicles into and will grow a network of service centres within these countries at a second stage, as required. Features

It is able to be charged at home, the office or at friends’ place. Charging to 100% takes a bit longer as our unique battery management system has an inbuilt routine, trickle charging and balancing, ensuring long battery life. And yes, there is more......
EleCa is self diagnosing many times a second and sends us alerts should anything be amiss so we may schedule a visit with a replacement part; even before it fails and at no cost to you for the first 8 years of ownership.Furthermore, the batteries in your EleCa are guaranteed for 8 years (please find further details in our T's & C's on our site).
Charging
Charging your EleCa is no different to charging your mobile device. It is able to be charged at home, the office or at friends’ place. Charging to 80% could take as little as three hours. Charging to 100% takes a bit longer as our unique battery management system has an inbuilt routine, trickle charging and balancing, ensuring long battery life. Certainly, adapters are available to charge your EleCa through third party charging stations. Who are we and why we shall succeed

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">The technology behind e-bikes caught my attention since the first contact.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">So I took action myself and up till today I created the frames Dayum and Honeymoon and am constantly working on new designs.

Everyday, you can see more and more e-bikes out on our streets. They are ecological and functional. But why do they all have to look the same? Truly boring, impersonal and simply limited to their task to take you from one place to another. With such looks it’s no coincidence that many people think e-bikes are for old people only.





But we are about to change that: Power-Bikes offers you no off the rack bike but a truly unique companion! With us you can individually customize your e-bike – we make it possible.


Power-Bikes takes the concept of e-bikes on a whole new level!






What We Offer
E-bikes are fun and give you a smooth ride! Power-Bikes offers an extraordinary, modern frame for this driving experience that has never been there before! 
The frame consists of two frame plates which are professionally welded and bolt together. Thereby sockets create the connection between the frame plates and together with up to 160 processed screws they give the bike its distinctive look!









These frames stand for themselves and are an absolute eye-catcher! Together with the integrated e-motor they form THE ultimate bike!


But that’s not the end of the story – there are numerous options to customize your bike as you wish – suiting your style. The amount of screws and sockets especially contribute to the possibilities for the choice of colour. Extras like side bags or a stronger motor and lighting can optionally be added to the bike as well. Let your imagination run free and design your personal Power-Bike!







And this is how you can get your dream bike …

First, you should decide whether you would like to have your up to 2,50m long bike ready for use sent to your home or if you’d rather like to order it as a building kit and assemble it yourself. In both basic versions your bike will be completely black and will be equipped with a 250W 36V motor* and a 12aH 36V battery. 

Please consider that there is a certain need for expertise to assemble the bike yourself when making your decision. When you’ve made your decision you can choose between the frames ‘Dayum’ and ‘Honeymoon’. 
* With a body weight more than 90kg the upgrade to 500W 36V is necessary.









Moreover you have the possibility to buy more extras for your bike to personalize it according to your ideas: free choice of colour, a lighting kit, side bags or a stronger motor. When you’ve decided what level of customization you wish your bike to have send us an e-mail and tell us which frame you wish for and especially – in case you’ve chosen to take the free choice of colour as well – in which colours your bike should shine. Therefore, tell us which part should be coated in which colour by using the corresponding RAL numbers. For orientation you can have a look at a colour table here. In cases of special colour requests like gold or chrome please don’t hesitate to contact us!



                     
                                 
If you decide to pick the „Bike Ultimate“ version you’ll impress your surroundings with your over 2,70m long bike! Your bike will be equipped with all extras and moreover it’ll have a mudguard in the back, instead of the normal double crown fork we’ll install a chromed Springer fork and also a considerably larger battery and you’ll have free choice of colour!









The technology behind e-bikes caught my attention since the first contact. That was when my father told me about his new electric bike about a year ago. But going out on the streets with a classic e-bike myself? No,that wasn’t to my taste. 
So I took action myself and up till today I created the frames Dayum and Honeymoon and am constantly working on new designs. I love working on the bikes! While tightening the screws I constantly get new ideas I would like to realise. But the best thing certainly is seeing the completed bike and riding it in the end! 





With Dayum and Honeymoon you can easily go on tours through the city or countryside. The strong e-motor makes it possible to drive on uneven ground as well. Whether going on a ride to a picnic at the lake or a cruise through the city – with Power-Bikes you can easily get everywhere you like. 
And because of the extraordinary and individual design you’ll definitely have all eyes on you! You’ll get to talk to interested people and not only you but also passing pedestrians will be enthused by your bike! This is also why I already arrange a little extra time when going on a ride.



After having built and successfully tested the first prototypes I need your support: new materials, components, and the development of the customizing program – I’m still at the beginning. I would love to design and built more bikes and especially expand the possibilities within the customization online and make them more user-friendly.
Support the campaign by pre-ordering your personal Power-Bike right now! And being quick pays off: The early-bird offers are limited and only there for a short time. 
Help me and share the campaign with all your friends and bike enthusiasts and become a fan on Facebook and a part of the Power-Bikes movement – so that we enrich the streets with awesome bikes and more power!




After reaching our campaign target, we will do our best to process your orders and produce your bikes according to your ideas. Please consider that a certain time is necessary to fulfil your wishes and that orders will be completed chronologically. First come first served.

Power-Bikes
Immer mehr E-Bikes sind auf unseren Straßen vertreten. Sie sind ökologisch und zweckmäßig gebaut. Doch warum sehen sie dabei immer gleich aus?Langweilig, unpersönlich und NUR beschränkt auf ihre Aufgabe, dich von A nach B zu bringen. Nicht ohne Grund sehen viele Leute E-Bikes als „Alte-Herren-Räder“ an!





Das werden wir ändern: Power-Bikes bietet dir kein Rad von der Stange,sondern einen einzigartigen Weggefährten! Mit uns kannst du dir dein einzigartiges Bike zusammenstellen – wir machen es möglich.
Power-Bikes bringt E-Bikes auf ein neues Level!






Das bieten wir!
E-Bikes machen Spaß und bieten ein gutes Fahrgefühl! Power-Bikes verpasst diesem Fahrgefühl einen außergewöhnlichen,noch nie da gewesenen, modernen Rahmen! 

Dieser besteht aus zwei massiven Rahmenplatten, die professionell verschweißt und verschraubt werden. Dabei schaffen Muffen die Verbindung zwischen den Platten und gemeinsam mit den bis zu 160 verarbeiteten Schrauben verleihen sie dem Bike seinen ganz besonderen Look!




Diese Rahmen stehen für sich und sind ein absoluter Hingucker! Gemeinsam mit dem integrierten E-Motor bilden sie DAS ultimative Bike! Doch dabei bleibt es nicht – es gibt zahlreiche Möglichkeiten, dein Bike zu individualisieren und deinem persönlichen Style anzupassen.

Beispielsweise trägt so auch die Vielzahl an Schrauben und Muffen dazu bei, dass die Bikes insbesondere auch farblich vielfältig gestaltet werden können. Extras wie Seitentaschen oder ein stärkerer Motor und Beleuchtung können dem Bike hinzugefügt werden. Lass deinem Geschmack freien Lauf und stelle dir dein persönliches Power-Bike zusammen!



Und so geht's zu deinem Traumbike...
Als erstes solltest du dir überlegen, ob du dein knapp 2,50m langes Bike bereits fertig zusammengebaut zu dir nach Hause geliefert haben möchtest oder ob du es als Bausatz selbstständig zusammen bauen willst. Bei beiden Basisvarianten ist dein Bike komplett schwarz und mit 250W 36V Motor* und 12aH 36V Akku ausgestattet. Bedenke bei deiner Entscheidung bitte, dass es eines gewissen Grads an Know-How bedarf, dein Bike zusammen zu bauen und auf jeden Fall entsprechende Erfahrung vorhanden sein sollte. Hast du dich entschieden, kannst du zwischen den Rahmen Dayum und Honeymoon wählen.

*Bei mehr als 90kg Körpergewicht ist das Upgrade auf 500W 36V erforderlich.



Darüber hinaus hast du die Möglichkeit, weitere Add-Ons für dein Bike zu kaufen, um es zu personalisieren: freie Farbwahl, ein Beleuchtungsset, Seitentaschen oder ein stärkerer Motor. Im Anschluss teilst du uns in einer E-Mail mit, welches Rahmenmodell du dir wünschst und speziell auch – falls du die freie Farbwahl gewählt hast – wie genau dein Bike farblich gestaltet werden soll. Schreib dafür auf, welches Bauteil in welcher Farbe erstrahlen soll und nutze dafür die entsprechende RAL-Nummer. Zur Orientierung steht dir hier eine Farbtabelle zur Verfügung. Bei besonderen Farbwünschen wie Gold oder Chrom kannst du uns gerne einfach kontaktieren! 
                      
                                  
Falls du dich für die Variante „Bike Ultimate“ entscheidest,beeindruckst du dein Umfeld mit deinem über 2,70m langem Bike! Dein gewählter Rahmen (Dayum oder Honeymoon) verfügt über alle Add-Ons und ist zusätzlich mit einem hinteren Schutzblech ausgestattet, statt einer normalen Doppelbrückengabel ist eine verchromte Springergabel verbaut und es besitzt einen deutlich größeren Akku. 






Die Technik der E-Bikes hat mich seit dem ersten Kontakt her fasziniert,doch selbst mit einem klassischen E-bike auf die Straße? Nein, das entsprach nicht meinem Geschmack. So wurde ich selbst tätig und entwarf bis zum heutigen Tag die Rahmenmodelle Dayum und Honeymoon und arbeitet stets an weiteren Ideen und Designs. 
Die Arbeit an den Bikes macht mir riesigen Spaß. Beim Schrauben fallen mir immer neue Ideen ein, die ich gerne noch verwirklichen möchte. Aber am Ende letztlich das fertige Bike zu sehen und endlich zu fahren ist das Größte!




Mit Dayum und Honeymoon von Power-Bikes kann man problemlos Touren durch Stadt und Land unternehmen. Der leistungsstarke E-Motor ermöglichtes auch auf unebenen Feldwegen problemlos durch das Gelände zu gelangen. Ob also zum Picknick an den See oder zum Cruisen durch die Stadt – mit Power-Bikes kann man überall entspannt hingelangen. Dabei zieht man auf Grund des individuellen Designs garantiert die Blicke auf sich. Man kommt ins Gespräch und nicht nur man selbst sondern auch vorüberziehende Passanten sind begeistert! Dafür plane ich bei meinen Touren fast schon immer mehr Zeit ein!






Nachdem die ersten Prototypen gebaut und erfolgreich getestet sind, brauche ich eure Unterstützung: Neue Materialen, Bauelemente, die Weiterentwicklung des Customizing-Programms – ich stehe noch ganz am Anfang. Gerne möchte ich mehr Bikes entwerfen und bauen und speziell auch die Möglichkeiten im Bereich des Customizing ausbauen und sie online benutzerfreundlich gestalten.

Supportet die Kampagne, indem ihr schon jetzt euer persönliches Power-Bike vorbestellt! Und schnell sein lohnt sich: Die „early-bird“ Angebote sind nur in begrenzter Stückzahl und nur für kurze Zeit verfügbar.
Helft mir und teilt die Kampagne mit euren Freunden und allen Bike-Enthusiasten und werdet Fan auf Facebook und teil der Power-Bike Bewegung – auf dass wir die Straße mit schöneren Bikes und mehr Power versehen!




Sobald das Kampagnenziel erreicht ist werden wir eure Bestellungen schnellstmöglich bearbeiten und eure Bikes nach euren Wünschen zu produzieren. Bitte habt Verständnis, dass es einer gewissen Zeit bedarf, eure individuellen Wünsche zu erfüllen und die Bestellungen chronologisch abgearbeitet werden. First come first served.

<h3><strong>EIN. CARRY YOUR DAY.</strong></h3>
<p>We’re delighted to introduce you to EIN. Referencing the German word for 'one', it is the first of its kind. An electric, single wheel, detachable trailer. Designed and engineered by Biomega. A unique choice that fits perfectly into your urban lifestyle - seamlessly making your daily life easier. With sleek Scandinavian design and lightweight materials, the EIN makes an emission-free commute the simplest of choices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618255256/dfwrstms3qhzua8gb3zq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WEIGHTLESS PROGRESS.</strong></h3>
<p>Seamless, hassle-free mobility is essential to a busy urban life. Bearing a family resemblance to the iconic Biomega range of mechanical, e-bikes and cargo bikes, the EIN features a sleek, white, monocoque capsule, which can accommodate either a couple of kids or cargo. Whether you’re a family or a cargo carrier, the EIN conveniently adapts to what you need. The intelligent, rechargeable digital motor detects motion in the bike and responds with its own power, in proportion, creating a ‘weightless’ cruising experience. </p>
<p>In other words, more assistance when you need it most and no assistance when you don’t need it at all. We call this 'weightless progress'.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>BEAT THE RUSH HOUR.</strong></h3>
<p>Because with the EIN, there isn’t one. With the EIN, you can forget about the rush hour and seamlessly cruise past congested traffic to wherever you want, whenever you want. The EIN is so slim you can even pass a standard three-wheel cargo bike on a bicycle lane. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>ATTACH AND DETACH.</strong></h3>
<p>The EIN single wheel trailer comes with a universal latching system that can be attached just beneath the saddle. Standard toddler seats can easily be fitted to the trailer and custom foam seats also allow for multiple configurations suited to your needs. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>LATCH ON, LATCH OFF.</strong></h3>
<p>It’s as simple as that. The simple and safe locking mechanism means you can cruise with ease, knowing that the e-trailer is secure and will only detach when you decide. It is conveniently designed for multiple users: drop your kids off at school in the morning, park the EIN securely and let your partner pick them up in the afternoon.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>EIN. IS THE FIRST.</strong></h3>
<p>EIN redefines what we expect of cargo transport. As the first of its category, no other cargo bike option is quite like it. We looked at what could make your daily life better and created a solution for just that, rather than trying to fix the limitations of the ordinary cargo bike. A solution that will carry your day. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>BUILT TO BE SEEN</strong>.</h3>
<p>Lighting and visibility are integral to Biomega’s bike designs. As such, the trailer comes with two regulatory reflector badges and reflective bands on the sides, making the trailer visible from all directions. Be seen and be safe.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>SECURE TRANSPORTATION.</strong> </h3>
<p>Protect your kids. Protect your cargo. Seated inside the trailer in the regulation approved seats, you can safely commute without worrying about your kids releasing their seatbelts. Built to comply with strict industry standards, the casing of the e-trailer is both durable and visible.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EIN.</strong></h3>
<p>Biking is an experience. An experience of noticing your surroundings, feeling the breeze as you cruise through town, talking to your kids when day-tripping in the park. Stopping when you want, taking a breath of fresh air and enjoying the full experience of free mobility. </p>

It was at that moment that E-rim was cultivated. My passion for IT, love for my wife-her desire to be at my side, and my commitment to a healthier lifestyle came to a perfect crossroad. I launched the E-rim campaign. My wife's condition inspired me to find a way to help her journey with me regardless of her illness and inspire others to fight beyond their limits...This is not a story.

<h3>FuelSrv's Story: A Canadian Company</h3>
<p>Pumping gas is an age-old experience that many people hate. After a long day, in a congested city, or in the rain/winter cold, pumping gas is the last thing anyone wants to do! Which is why we created FuelSrv.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563306411/dzvim18icgwdnxh7vi0z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I used to work as a full serve gas attendant in Nova Scotia, Canada, and enjoyed making people happy with little things like pumping their gas, cleaning their windshield, filling their car tires, and topping off their fluids. It's a simple thing that can go a long way, especially in a busy world where car maintenance and fillups are a huge hassle!</p>
<p>The purpose of our campaign is to help bring FuelSrv to more people in Vancouver, and throughout Canada. We currently have an amazing app, website, and fueling truck ready to deliver gas and services to our customers, but we just need a bit more financial help to get us going. Your contribution would mean so much in terms of bringing ease and convenience to those like you and I who hate, or can't, pump their own gas.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What FuelSrv Needs</h3>
<p>Our financial goal is simple: We're hoping to raise $2,500 to help pay for the startup costs associated with servicing our first customers. This includes purchasing fuel, motor oil, and windshield wash so that our first customers can enjoy quick, reliable service without delays. These funds would also help pay for a power inverter to install in our truck, which would allow us to power the air compressor we use to fill car tires, which we currently need to power and fill at-home multiple times each day!</p>

<p>Each contribution goes a long way, and each contributor will receive full recognition for their funding across our social media profiles, as well as on our website on a new page titled, ""Supporters"".</p>
<p>If we do not reach our target goal, the funds will remain extremely valuable as each contribution goes towards purchasing the first fuel and fluids that will go directly to our first customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>FuelSrv's Impact: Helping Canadians</h3>
<p>FuelSrv's goal is to make life easier for those who hate pumping gas, can't pump gas, or simply don't have the time in a busy, congested world. Trust me, we get it! Direct-to-consumer services make life so much easier for people, and the act of keeping someone on the road with less effort (and great peace of mind) can make a world of difference.</p>
<p>Your contribution would directly support an effort that seeks to enrich the lives of others, and would directly make peoples' lives better; putting a smile on their face after experiencing getting gas in a brand new way.</p>

<p>We have a successful track record to-date, from which you can trust your contribution will be used properly and efficiently, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase and installation of an innovative, one-of-a-kind fueling system for our company truck, which delivers both Regular and Premium right to your car</li>
<li>Development of the FuelSrv mobile app for iOS and Android, which allows you to request fuel and full service at your finger tips</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge of developing any new service is getting people to consider replacing an age-old experience with an easier, more convenient one. The risks that FuelSrv faces involve monetary loss as a result of slow growth and challenges related to customer traction. However, FuelSrv is uniquely qualified to tackle these challenges with its proven track record of developing new, innovative hardware and software that are field-tested and ready to operate.</p>

<p>We know such events occur infrequently and normally the possibility is low, but really this could save your car or even your life.</p>
<p><strong>To DO</strong> or <strong>NOT TO DO</strong>?</p>
<p>To set up a regular warning triangle is easy but risky. According to UK traffic rule, a warning triangle should be placed on the road at least <strong>45 metres/147 feet</strong>(the figures vary from country to country) behind your broken-down vehicle on the same side of the road. The question is how to make the process of ""put a warning triangle at least 45 meters behind your vehicle"" safe.</p>

<p><strong>2. The foldable storage bag (Size S - $10, Size M - $20, Size L - $30)</strong></p>
<p>Since we upgrade the packaging design to the pumpkin box, we have sourced this add-on for those who expect a much well-organized trunk. This is a foldable storage bag with reflective stripe on the side. It comes with 3 sizes and is perfect for storing TRILIGHT, the jumper, the cable and other tools while making the trunk well organized. Also, this bag will keep TRILIGHT from extremely freezing temperature to extend the standby time.</p>

Featuring electric warning triangle, jump starter, power bank, work light and more, TRILIGHT leads the way for safety, convenience and quality. It’s the 7 in 1 car partner you've been searching for.


 

 


 

 



Warning triangles on the market do NOT give enough warning. They are NOT reflective
•When car headlights from behind are off in the daytime, or at dawn
•When the visibility is relatively low when raining, snowing or on a foggy day

TRILIGHT turns a passive warning into a proactive warning.


We know such events occur infrequently and normally the possibility is low, but really this could save your car or even your life.
To DO or NOT TO DO?
To set up a regular warning triangle is easy but risky. According to UK traffic rule, a warning triangle should be placed on the road at least 45 metres/147 feet(the figures vary from country to country) behind your broken-down vehicle on the same side of the road. The question is how to make the process of ""put a warning triangle at least 45 meters behind your vehicle"" safe.

Therefore, we integrate SOS mode into TRILIGHT.

In SOS mode, please point the TRILIGHT directly at the ground. It’s still bright and noticeable enough for the driver of a car behind to notice.

We also know that this does not happen often, but really it could save time and even a lot of money by not having to call for road service or replacing with a new battery.

Also, TRILIGHT can jump start at least 15 consecutive times with just a single charge.

We know there are a lot alternatives but this is better than nothing, and it is always a perfect backup.


The 3 detachable magnetic light bars are designed with an individual control system for various applications. Warning light, bike light, ambient light and more.

 

Individual Control Mode

Auto Breathing Light Mode

Built-In Magnet

The Bike Light


The TRILIGHT and TRILIGHT S feature rotating handles which are designed as a light stand and a drop light.
The Work Light

The Drop Light

 

The TRILIGHT PRO features a rotating handle with a strong built-in magnet. It can be used as a standing light, a drop light and a hands-free light for various working conditions.



Simply press the power button, you can easily switch modes between work light(high brightness mode), camp/ambient light(low brightness mode), SOS light(flashing mode) and warning triangle(on/flashing/off).

 



Unlike some design teams who launch projects before they find a manufacturer, we are a qualified team with both design and manufacturing experience. Therefore we are extremely confident in both our product quality and the delivery time.


UPDATE #1
The T-dock & LED light bar

We've got a multitude of messages to ask if the light bar can be separately purchased. Now we are releasing the T-dock, both a dock to charge the light bar and a clip to connect the regular warning triangle to make it electric warning triangle featuring our ultra-high-visibility technology.

 

This combo makes any warning triangle currently in your car an electric warning triangle. Please refer to the below section for more details on our ultra- high-visibility technology.

UPDATE#2
The Pumpkin Box 
This is a key upgrade for backers pledging TRILIGHT, TRILIGHT S and TRILIGHT PRO. We will provide the pumpkin box as the packaging design. Meanwhile, it can be used as a spare stand that the light bars could stick to while users are trying to repair cars with the work light or jump starter features.

 



ADD-ON
1. The magnetic handle ($10)
This is mainly for those pledging TRILIGHT standard version but still looking for a hands-free work light with built-in magnet so that you can easily adjust TRILIGHT up to 220 degree.

2. The foldable storage bag (Size S - $10, Size M - $20, Size L - $30)
Since we upgrade the packaging design to the pumpkin box, we have sourced this add-on for those who expect a much well-organized trunk. This is a foldable storage bag with reflective stripe on the side. It comes with 3 sizes and is perfect for storing TRILIGHT, the jumper, the cable and other tools while making the trunk well organized. Also, this bag will keep TRILIGHT from extremely freezing temperature to extend the standby time.









Unlike the creative industry, lighting is a more traditional industry with high standards both in technology and quality. We are a lighting company. With our experience of ODM for big names in the industry, we know how to make products with better quality, right up to military grade levels. With one big step forward, we are bringing our latest technology and creativity to Kickstarter, to make people’s lives safer and more convenient.",58.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm from Belgium, homeland of Eddy Merckx, Tom Boonen, Philipe Gilbert and many other famous pro-racers.</p>
<p>Most of us know about the challenge of changing a rear wheel fast and easy and keeping your hands clean at the same time. A year ago I came up with the idea to separate the rear wheel from the cassette so the cassette stays attached to the frame. The biggest challenge was to overcome the internal weakness of the axle and to make the construction as simple as possible. These challenges have been overcome in my game-changing hub D-Fix!</p>
<p>This hub can also be used in mountain bikes.</p>
<p>In the Cycling Weekly video (see link below), you can see the wheel taken out in about 3 seconds. The wheel can be taken out and put back in 6,5 seconds.</p>

<br/><h1>The Story</h1>
<div>
<p>  My name is JACK(Wang) , I ever worked in  JAPAN. I'm a mechnical ergineer and  a a commuter.Every day I take a bus or ride a bike to my work place which is 3km  away from my living place . For such a  short trip , I aslo will encounter a traffic jam and take a few minutes to parking.  I've counted that this spend me the same time as walking if I take a  shortcut. I found many people have a similar experience with me especially  within 3km.distance. </p>

What is STEAM


   The Steam board is designed bo be smaller ,lightweight,long running,and fast.The oversize is 78.5x21x12cm.Smaller than any longboard in the world.It has enough power to go 22 MPH uphill, will take you 11 real world miles per full charge.




   If your working place is only 3km from you , how do you get there? Drive your car ,ride a bike ,take a bus or subwany? 
 In a car we deal with traffic, parking, and of course rising fuel costs. On a bicycle, we work up a sweat and then have to find a safe place to lock up.For this short trips,we felt there had to be a better way to handle these short trips.What we want  is a portable and intesting transportation.Never worried about parking and traffic.And you can take it anywhere.
  Today, we are happy to present Steam, a super portable electric vehicle.




  Whether it is commuting to work, getting to the subway or bus stop, running errands, or trying to just get across a college campus, short trips and urban travel have always been frustrating. 





 
  Through the concentrated and collaborative efforts of mechanical engineer，electrical engineering,we finally developed the most powerful, compact  wheel on the market.Even more,we try our best to make it Ultra-quiet and low heat production.
Relying on in-wheel direct drive , Steam board can achieve  not only high speed, but also excellent grade  ability, instead of short-lived and clumsy belts.

  
The motor is  sensored & brushless DC Motor .Its  accurate design make it very high efficiency (95%).


          You can use STEAM, not only on the flat ground, but also for inclines
  Our battery technology is very similar to what you would find in a Tesla . The farthest distance you can ride per full charge is 11mles(18km). In real world conditions, most of our test riders are getting more 11 miles per charge. When you do need to recharge, it takes only 90 minutes .  






  You can control the throttle and braking of the board with our handheld remote. To accelerate forward, you simply push the slider forward. The farther you push it forward, the faster you will go.   If you pull the slider back it will apply the brakes to slow you down and eventually bring you to a stop.

    Press the DIRECTION button ,you can ride both forward and backward.


 







It has a top speed of 35km/h (22 mph) and it is faster  than  riding a bicycle!

It has a range of about 18km (11miles), more than what you need for the short daily commute in the city.

                        Modifying the DC Motor before Assembly


  The Steam board was designed and will continue to be produced and assembled in CHINA.  We will use a combination of imported and domestic components to assemble all of the boards in our  manufacturing facility. To ensure the quality of each board is good.
The Story

  My name is JACK(Wang) , I ever worked in  JAPAN. I'm a mechnical ergineer and  a a commuter.Every day I take a bus or ride a bike to my work place which is 3km  away from my living place . For such a  short trip , I aslo will encounter a traffic jam and take a few minutes to parking.  I've counted that this spend me the same time as walking if I take a  shortcut. I found many people have a similar experience with me especially  within 3km.distance. 
 I thought that how to move more quickly without traffic and parking.After thinking about it I realized that the ideal means of transport would have to be small enough to take . For this reason my team  created Steam: the smallest and longest  running electric skateboard with in-wheel motor.And this is what we want.




Rewards
 We have great swag like decals, t-shirts, and hoodies.  But the best reward is getting your own board.  We've got an early special for our first 30 backers, normal pricing for the rest, and special discount.  We also offer personalized engraving (your choice, within reason) on the motor mount of the truck.  Finally, we have a limited run of beta units that we will deliver two months before the rest of the boards.  Please contact us for more details if you're interested.






We are a group of engineers and designers who passionately believe in sustainable transportation.  We are fortunate enough to have an outstanding group of advisors and mentors, as well as strong support from TONGKE'S WORLD. We hope to show people new ideas about what an electric vehicle can be and share with them new possibilities when it comes to short range transportation. We hope to build excitement about the practicality and efficiency of great electric transportation.

<p></p>
<p>Wivel will not sacrifice the precision to making
itself invisible like many other OBDII dongles do. </p>
<p>It is easily noticeable that a GPS signal
is the best in the open fields with clear sky and it does not get satellite
fixes inside the buildings. Due to Wivel using a patch antenna, it is easily
mounted inside the vehicle in a way, so that the GPS antenna is located
horizontally with the best position being beneath the windshield. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>If this is still insufficient, the antenna
can be removed from the device and placed outside, on top of the car.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the
position of the device itself is not restricted – it can be mounted as desired,
since the device calibrates its position automatically.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465909919/spacer_must_joon_whbedt.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p>Our superior accuracy is provided through sophisticated digital filtration, signal processing and data fusion algorithms that take conventional GPS accuracy down<b> from 5 m to 50 cm. </b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The advantage of Wivel is that it combines
all the possible measurements of the vehicle dynamics’ parameters into one
compact package. By doing so, the ultimate precision is achieved through
several sensors’ data fusion in the firmware of the device. Using the data
derived from the disparate sources allows Wivel to provide information that is
more accurate than it would ever be while using the individual sources.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465580062/7_s3lllc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>After digitally filtering the individual sensor data, sensor fusion will take place, using the extended <b>Kalman filter implementation</b>, which in it’s turn, combines an output that uses weights by the quality of measurements. Wivel also contains secondary sensors, namely magnetometer and a barometric altimeter that improve such calculation parameters as drift angle, lean angle etc.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465579611/9_e5ghdx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>In addition to the OBDII interface, Wivel
has an extra power source and a few inputs for additional sensors. </p>
<p>For the vehicles manufactured before 1996 and
motorcycles we use some additional inputs to monitor the<b> engine speed, throttle
position, coolant temperature, brake and oil pressure</b> etc. </p>

<p>Try to think about Wivel in the same way
you think about your smartphone or a wearable tracker that is customized for
you, only that Wivel is customized for your car or your motorbike. Wivel
connects itself to a vehicle directly for a maximum integration into its
dynamic processes. Smartphones cannot achieve that and have to compromise on
precision.</p>Beside that, most of our <b>mobile phone</b>s are equipped with a <b>1 Hz GPS</b>. This means that your phone is asking for its coordinates <b>once every second</b>. A car passes 27,78 meters in one second when travelling 100 km/h. This means that cell phones accuracy at 100km/h is 27.78 meters. Accepted rate of accuracy for performance measurement is max 0,5 meters at 100km/h and that's why we use 50 Hz GPS instead of 1 Hz.

don’t have any restrictions on the energy consumption. Therefore your device
can always concentrate on the high frequency measurements and calculations
without being disturbed by any other functions. High sensor update rate means
that there is more data available for calculations, however it appears to be meaningless
if uncertainty is also high. That is the reason why the data mining inside the
firmware is dynamic and adapting to the conditions. <p></p>

braking times, cornering forces, laps and distances. Moreover, Wivel can
estimate your car wheel power and the torque.






Wivel will not sacrifice the precision to making
itself invisible like many other OBDII dongles do. 
It is easily noticeable that a GPS signal
is the best in the open fields with clear sky and it does not get satellite
fixes inside the buildings. Due to Wivel using a patch antenna, it is easily
mounted inside the vehicle in a way, so that the GPS antenna is located
horizontally with the best position being beneath the windshield. 



If this is still insufficient, the antenna
can be removed from the device and placed outside, on top of the car.
However, it should be noted that the
position of the device itself is not restricted – it can be mounted as desired,
since the device calibrates its position automatically.







Our superior accuracy is provided through sophisticated digital filtration, signal processing and data fusion algorithms that take conventional GPS accuracy down from 5 m to 50 cm. 

The advantage of Wivel is that it combines
all the possible measurements of the vehicle dynamics’ parameters into one
compact package. By doing so, the ultimate precision is achieved through
several sensors’ data fusion in the firmware of the device. Using the data
derived from the disparate sources allows Wivel to provide information that is
more accurate than it would ever be while using the individual sources.


After digitally filtering the individual sensor data, sensor fusion will take place, using the extended Kalman filter implementation, which in it’s turn, combines an output that uses weights by the quality of measurements. Wivel also contains secondary sensors, namely magnetometer and a barometric altimeter that improve such calculation parameters as drift angle, lean angle etc.


In addition to the OBDII interface, Wivel
has an extra power source and a few inputs for additional sensors. 
For the vehicles manufactured before 1996 and
motorcycles we use some additional inputs to monitor the engine speed, throttle
position, coolant temperature, brake and oil pressure etc. 

On OBDII equipped cars we use analog inputs to log the
additional sensors that register brake pressure, steering angle, etc. We use linear
potentiometers to measure the suspension, but it can also be used with any kind
of a custom setup. 





Since Wivel is going to develop over the next
few years, it is very important for us to be at your disposal. With the help of
our service app we can constantly update the device firmware, improve its
accuracy, as well as create the new features and connect new apps to it. In
case something happens with Wivel, we can we can find possible problems remotely.

We are proud to announce that Wivel is already merged with Harry's Laptimer, world's bestselling data recording tool for car and bike enthusiasts. Wiveltracker and Harry's LapTimer are a great fit and share a common idea. Both of the products were born on the racetrack, they are developed by racers for racers 
NB! We are offering this proven solution as a  bonus to our perks


It is a proven solution that has more than 750 track
included globally. Its users have already logged more than 5.2
million miles with 61% users drive in USA, 30% drive in Europe







Wivel platform is an open source. We have designed
Wivel to be able to work with many useful mobile applications that can help you
to connect with your car or motorcycle. We offer you the cutting edge
technologies, the data gathering and streaming like none of our competitors can
include. We are constantly working on the integrating and developing more apps. 
If we don’t support your favorite app or if you want to develop further your app, please contact us:  info@wiveltracker.com 







Try to think about Wivel in the same way
you think about your smartphone or a wearable tracker that is customized for
you, only that Wivel is customized for your car or your motorbike. Wivel
connects itself to a vehicle directly for a maximum integration into its
dynamic processes. Smartphones cannot achieve that and have to compromise on
precision.Beside that, most of our mobile phones are equipped with a 1 Hz GPS. This means that your phone is asking for its coordinates once every second. A car passes 27,78 meters in one second when travelling 100 km/h. This means that cell phones accuracy at 100km/h is 27.78 meters. Accepted rate of accuracy for performance measurement is max 0,5 meters at 100km/h and that's why we use 50 Hz GPS instead of 1 Hz.



vehicles
don’t have any restrictions on the energy consumption. Therefore your device
can always concentrate on the high frequency measurements and calculations
without being disturbed by any other functions. High sensor update rate means
that there is more data available for calculations, however it appears to be meaningless
if uncertainty is also high. That is the reason why the data mining inside the
firmware is dynamic and adapting to the conditions. 





as well as other internal sensors
including (gyroscope, accelerometer, digital compass, magnetometer and
altimeter) that are averaged with the several times higher frequencies. OBDII
parameters are inquired at a car’s maximum allowed rate. Data transmission over
Bluetooth is also dynamic and adjusts itself to the situation. It means that
stopping at the traffic lights generates less data than the high speed driving
on a circle track.
















Sami Sivonen (APR Finland)

""Even though we do have a highly
sophisticated data logging system from Motec installed in our Audi R8 1:1, we
choose Wivel to make sure that we have the records of every outing with our
car. Automatic saving of the drive data and a backup
into a cloud allows us to always have our key performance data available, even
in case something goes wrong with our primary system. Weighing mere 35 grams it
is a no sacrifice to have such a device on board at all times."" 


Marko Rohtlaan (Vihurmoto)

""The most important things in racing
are knowing what you are doing and analyzing data. You can only win if you are
consistent, precise and fast. For that you need a data logger.  It will help you to monitor the smallest of
the details, ensure the best driving line, pin-point your own mistakes and see how
the bikes’ parameters change after adjustments.""




Kristjan Klemets (Team Ghost)
“Go into a corner, know your entry angle.
Make a suspension adjustment, know you’re making more g’s or not. Tune the
engine, see the result.”



Gustaf Bürström (Revline Time Attack)
""By constantly following up and
analyzing the data I can make sure that I develop the car the right way and
improve my driving in the areas where I can cut the most lap time. Without data
logging it would have been like navigating without a map.""",52.0,1,"1 Campaign

You only have to park up in order to automatically recharge it.The Spark concept is easily adaptable to all situations, being able to be fitted into houses, buildings and communal spaces, being specially designed for environments committed to sustainability and energy saving.  You already
control many gadgets and everyday life activities through your iPhone which acts as a
control hub from which you'll get all the precise information required to run your Xkuty making
possible the modifying of all Xkuty main parameters... A real iBike!

1.5 km to 20 km, also depending on where you live. Xkuty One is a definitive solution to the balance, between range and
recharge time.

<h3>Smart cities need smart transit for a smart future</h3>
<p>Picture a world where the streets of cities and suburbs are free of cars.</p>
<p>Sounds like science fiction?  It’s not — it’s Transit X.</p>
<p><strong>Transit X is rethinking transportation.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502319247/p8pao7bng3uk2pzbw263.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.</strong></i></p>
<p>Transit X is a safe, sustainable, low-cost mass transit alternative with the potential to replace cars, buses, trains, trucks, and even short flights as the travel method of choice.</p>
<p>We’re gearing up for our first demonstration in Boston, Massachusetts, which will be ready in 2018.</p>
<h3>Rethinking mass transit</h3>
<p>Cars remain the dominant mode of transportation, yet billions of people suffer from the negative impact of our cars and roadways: long commutes, costly infrastructure, carbon emissions, air pollution, and crashes.  We call this “Roads Disease” — and we all suffer from it.</p>
<p><strong>Transit X is a cure for Roads Disease.</strong></p>
<p>The exciting thing is — cities are taking action. Across the country, cities and towns are migrating towards “smart city” initiatives in an effort to update their infrastructure with smarter, safer, more eco-friendly and economic ways to structure their transportation systems. This is further bolstered by the private sector paying diligent attention to the opportunities with the Smart City momentum. Transit X will help push our transportation into a new era through private financing for Smart City infrastructure without having to depend on public financing.</p>
<p>Many assume that it looks like an evolution of the system we already have: ridesharing, electric vehicles, and self-driving cars have all become media darlings of the venture capital world.</p>
<p>But what if the real answer is more radical than that? What if, instead of just modifying our existing modes of transportation, there was a way to fundamentally redesign the way we get from point A  to point B?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Transit X Factor</h2>
<p>Transit X is a completely new approach to transportation that combines the convenience of personal cars, the capacity of trains, the speed of flying, and the sustainability of bicycles.</p>
<p>With Transit X, passengers travel in pods suspended from a narrow track. Pods carry up to five passengers. Special pods carry wheelchairs and freight. Tracks run alongside existing roads and highways, so Transit X is minimally disruptive to cities’ existing infrastructure.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502319378/tlj5kuoyuuwnycg49loq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Passengers board at stops that are more convenient than subway stations or bus stops. Simply enter your destination via smartphone or kiosk, then climb aboard. Once you board your pod, it takes off, flying above the cars on the road and carrying you nonstop to your destination.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Transit X is:</h3>
<p><strong>Green</strong></p>
<p>Transit X is 100% solar powered, carbon free and zero emissions. Solar panels on the track provide the energy to power electric pods.</p>
<p><strong>Fast</strong></p>
<p>Transit X pods travel non stop at 45 mph (72 km/h) along main roads and 135 mph (217 km/h) along highways.</p>
<p><strong>Seamless</strong></p>
<p>Transit X pods are quiet and smooth. Transit X fits seamlessly into cities. Tracks can be installed along roads, highways, and railways. Installation is fast and not disruptive to neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Safe</strong></p>
<p>Transit X is incredibly safe — similar to the safety of commercial airlines and orders of magnitude safer than cars — even autonomous cars.</p>
<p><strong>Economical</strong></p>
<p>Transit X is economical for individuals and municipalities alike. Transit X arranges private financing for projects — and does not require public financing. Passenger fares are affordable — comparable to existing mass transit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our next destination: a city near you</strong></h3>
<p>To date, the Transit X team has met with representatives from more than 100 cities around the world who have expressed interest in Transit X.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502320420/akwtmoq4kjsdechhnixg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When we pitch municipalities, a common reaction is: “So you’re proposing to solve our congestion, pollution, and parking issues, and you’ll privately finance it? Yes, we are very interested!”</p>
<p>It’s the strength of our value proposition that has enabled us to build a sales pipeline of $100 billion in projects — with minimal marketing or sales costs. Now, we need to build the demonstration.</p>
<h3>Why we will win</h3>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Low cost to government and passengers alike. Privately funded with high margins</p>
<p><strong>Convenience: </strong>Provides last-mile, car-like convenience to both cities and suburbs. Fast, nonstop travel.</p>
<p><strong>Compactness: </strong>Fits above existing streets, highways, and railways</p>
<p><strong>Carbon-free:</strong> 100% electric and pollution-free to minimize environmental impact</p>
<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> The high capacity to replace mass transit and serve the smallest towns to the largest cities in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Dependable and resilient service that eliminates possible disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> Low-cost and scalable to serve all areas equitably. </p>
<p><strong>Competitive barriers: </strong>Extremely high barriers to entry. A natural monopoly.</p>
<p><strong>Crash-free: </strong>Extremely high levels of safety due to automation, redundant systems, and grade separation.  100,000 times safer than cars.</p>
<h3>Partnership with Altran</h3>
<p>Transit X is proud to be partnering with Altran to bring our system to life. Altran is a global engineering firm that has designed, built, and operated automated transit and high-speed rail systems around the world. The Altran team has spent hundreds of hours reviewing our design, and they are confident they can certify, build, and operate Transit X.</p>

<p>Within 4 months from the end of our fund raising campaign, we will demonstrate a full-size Transit X pod operating on a track. It’s going to be awesome!</p>

<p>To keep your eyes and face <b>healthy and young looking </b>for years ahead, you need to protect them from direct sun. Its more than just sun UV rays that age your skin directly - it also makes you wrinkle your face without noticing. </p>
<p>So when driving under direct sun, this means first and foremost – <b>use
your car's visors</b>, even if you are wearing sun glasses (recommended too !).  In fact, best use the visors anytime you drive under hot sun, even if not facing direct sun.  Indirect, strong sun radiation can also be damaging
to your eyes and face, and this also has an accumulating effect. Control it, and your
eyes and face will be and look younger for much longer.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> – when facing direct sun you instinctively strain your face
to narrow your eyes. The ""hotter"" the sun, the more you strain your
face, even without noticing.  Over time,
this strain creates small, permanent wrinkles. These can make your face look
older than it really is.  Use the visors
and keep your face younger and healthier!</p>
<p> How hot is ""hot sun""
for you to use the visors ?  Your eyes and
face will tell you. Just flip down the visors upon feeling
the slightest inconvenience with the sun at the time, and at any need to narrow
your eyes. </p>
<p>But since the visor's size cannot
offer protection from the sun beyond its perimeter,  <b>apply SunChek to each visor, and use it extensively ! !  This way you get the most protection
available to your eyes and face from damaging  sun radiation. </b></p>
<p> In fact, use <b>SunChek</b> to <b>shade as much of your face</b> as is
practical, beyond just hiding the sun from your eyes.  Besides making for a safer, more relaxed and
comfortable driving, <b>it directly protects your face and keeps it younger.</b></p><p><b>Test this way to feel the difference -</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460877733/14_-_%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%93_%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F_2_h5xxwk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 411px;""/></p><p><b>a)</b> Drive regulary with the visor folded up, and the sun shines (even if not hitting your eyes directly).

older than it really is.  Use the visors
and keep your face younger and healthier!
 How hot is ""hot sun""
for you to use the visors ?  Your eyes and
face will tell you. Just flip down the visors upon feeling
the slightest inconvenience with the sun at the time, and at any need to narrow
your eyes. 
But since the visor's size cannot
offer protection from the sun beyond its perimeter,  apply SunChek to each visor, and use it extensively ! !  This way you get the most protection
available to your eyes and face from damaging  sun radiation. 
 In fact, use SunChek to shade as much of your face as is
practical, beyond just hiding the sun from your eyes.  Besides making for a safer, more relaxed and
comfortable driving, it directly protects your face and keeps it younger.Test this way to feel the difference -a) Drive regulary with the visor folded up, and the sun shines (even if not hitting your eyes directly). Now flip the visor down. Feel how your face relaxes and your eyes widen  ?  This is exactly what will keep your face wrinkle free, healthy & young looking.  b) With the visor down against direct sun, when you reach a strech of the road such that the visor cannot protect your eyes from direct sun anymore - move your SunChek to hide the sun from your eyes, and better yet your face also. Feel how much more comfortable  and relaxed your face and driving becomes ? !   Now it's not only  protected eyes and face - it's plain old driving safety for you and your loved ones, and the other drivers sharing the road with youHow to use SunCheckWhenever you feel the sun
radiation makes you a bit uncomfortable, first flip down the visor, and turn it
to the sun side.  If still feeling
uncomfortable with too much light or heat, or if the sun still hits your eyes –
even from an angle – slide your SunChek far enough so as to hide the
sun, shade your face and restore comfortable, relaxed and fun driving
when you need to
only hide one part of the scene that's sunny, while leaving the rest
exposed -  Such as when both the sun and a
traffic light are ahead - just angle and lower one corner of your SunChek to hide the sun, leaving the traffic light in plain
sight.SunChek is presently made in only one size, which serves
well for most cars, and measures 122mmX366mm =  4.80""X14.41""  across.  It is formed from  opaque plastic, enhanced with carbon black for better sun resistance. Each band is 50mm=0.98"" wide and approximately 380mm=15"" long.  Its middle, white section if flexible, fabric protected rubber, and it has two opposing (male/female) velkro ends, coloured black,  one shorter and one longer.SunChek Logo is attached to each SunChek  in the middle.  This leaves room for two  50X100mm=2""X4"" stickers of your choice on each side - so you can promote your preferred project, candidate, firm,  or flag  -  see SUPER EARLY PROMOTION BIRD perk.  Send us the graphics - we will post your stickers on each SunChek - See example below -Our team Haya Karni, campaign managerMother of two, grandmother of six, managing engineering firmAmit Karni, inventor & developer, projects manager, weekends yard carpenterGil Aizenman, graphics & media , one and only graphics ninjaCookie & Bugs, support teamIn charge of  mental & general support of our team, which can be very tiring at times.

raised be used for
The initial capital
required for producing the design, patenting,  first prototypes' production
and testing, and tooling up for mass production, was raised by the campaign team out of pocket. In fact, we can start shipping as soon as this Indiegogo campaign goal is reached, or even earlier !
 Most of the money now raised at the
campaign,  will be used to finance purchasing of materials, components and services, for mass production of SunChek
units and shipment to contributors.
The funds raised will
also be used to develop more versions of SunChek – such as larger sizes
for trucks and pickups, with yet even wider coverage range, and some more applications which will be revealed when
the time comes.  You are more than
welcome to suggest your desirable development directions for us to take on, based on
your own field experience. This is the kind of advice we appreciate the
most!  


for you and the passenger beside you, have a pleasant & safe drive, and keep your eyes & face healthier and younger  !  Join & Enjoy",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A mid-drive system offers numerous technical advantages over a more traditional hub motor system, including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Higher performance and torque</b> - the motor drives the crank instead of the wheel. Imagine the gears on the bike as the gears on the motor. When driving up a hill, switching to a lighter gear allows you to maintain the same pedaling cadence which in turn allows the motor to run efficiently and provide more power.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Easy handling</b> - the motor is positioned in the middle of the crank creating a low center of gravity. </li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Easy maintenance</b> - patch a flat tire the same way you would for a regular bike. </li>
</ul>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The BBS01, 36V motor from Bafang (250W as Pedelec for Europe, 350W as ebike for the U.S.) is the chosen mid-motor on the E-Roadster. The BBS01 with its very high 80Nm torque provides ample power for you. This is<b> 30% stronger than most other competitors!</b><br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">For Europe the bike can be delivered as pedelec (limit 25kph) or speed-pedelec (limit 45kph). The price does not change.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The supplier factory of the mid-motor system named Suzhou Bafang is a well-run, high capacity factory that firmly holds its place as the biggest manufacturer of e-bike motors in the world (sales figures show<b> 830,000 e-bike motors and 260,000 e-bike systems were sold in 2014 alone</b>). We know the people well and we know the factory.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""> </div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The motor comes with its own sine-wave controller integrated into the mid-motor case. It has a high max current of <b>15A/18A</b>. Controllers are the intermediary between your commands on the display and the motor power. The display is your interface to motor performance. The controller receives your command from the display and tells the battery how much power (current) to channel into the motor. </p>

<h1>WHO ARE WE</h1>
<p>We are Holger and Cheri Hüttlin (it's us in the video above). We both live in Shanghai, China,
and together we established and run HÜTTLIN Pedelecs (<a href=""www.huttlin-pedelecs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.huttlin-pedelecs.com</a>). Living and working in the
manufacturing hub of the world China, we are able to carefully select the most
reliable factories and suppliers and work with them for concept, design and manufacturing and quality control of our bikes. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Please also follow our  contributions and information on  Huttlin E-Roadster  on FB: (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/huttlineroadster?fref=nf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/huttlineroadster?fref=nf</a>)</span></p>
<p>With our experience and the successful co-operation with our suppliers around Shanghai, we have worked for several brands from other countries to produce their own bikes in China. But we have our own vision of the future. <b>We want to realize this vision through our brand HÜTTLIN.</b> The pledges we receive in this campaign will not only secure the development and consolidation of the carbon E-Roadster but will also help to develop other models that we would like to present to you and also offer to you. We think this direct communications is a wonderful way to offer you cheap the best you can get. Directly from the manufacturing line into your hands. Nobody else to earn money along the line. It is just your money to be saved.<br/></p>

<p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">HOW IT ALL STARTED:</b><br/></p>
<p>Holger’s life as a cyclist started early. As a teenager, he attended a
<b>boarding school for athletes and his sport was road cycling</b>. His first bike was
an Italian ALAN, then Colnago, Muesing, fourth was an Eddy Merckx,
and the latest one which he still riding, a Belgium Duell with the fine parts of
Campagnolo Record.</p>
<p>Holger's education in Berlin and at Miami Adschool in South Beach, Florida gave him the foundation for creative design. Growing up in Germany and spending many years working alongside his father in their family's pharmaceutical machinery business taught him about Engineering and Good-Manufacturing-Practice. <br/></p>
<p>Holger was studying e-bikes for some time but it wasn’t until he came to
live in China that he bought his first mid-drive e-bike from a local
manufacturer in late 2011. <b>Holger rode 14,000 km (approximately 8,700 miles) in
his first year</b>. Although this e-bike came with its share of technical and
quality issues, Holger<a class="""" href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Red AdBlocker""> </a>continuously worked to solve the issues and still owns this bike today.</p>
<p>As for Cheri, she came to China to study the Chinese language. And not too much  after startig Chinese class she worked in market research in small firm in Shanghai. After Cheri met Holger, Cheri was infatuated by Holger's passion for e-bikes and cycling, and together they run HÜTTLIN Pedelecs. Cheri is a great talent in <b>Research and Organisation</b>. Together they want to produce the best bikes - QUALITY - RELATIONSHIP - INNOVATION.</p>
<p>And that's how it all started. </p>

<p>During the time Holger was studying the competitive advantage of German supermarket chain ALDI, he came across the works of the late Edward Deming.

<p>The HÜTTLIN E-Roadster is a bike that is ready for mass production. With our experience and dedication we know we can make it a success not just for us, but for you too. We just need your help to get it out there. Let's make the earth a less polluted place and get you out of traffic and in shape. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>THE IMPACT</b></h3>
<div>We want to explain more about our campaign, why it is so important to us and we want to let you know the difference your contribution will make.<br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>We have some customized solutions that we would like to implement on the bike and the funds we raise in this campaign will help us do just that. <b>Each pledge goes directly into the further development and consolidation of the carbon bike and also provides us funding for our next production </b>that we want to share with you. We are convinced that the HUTTLIN E-Roadster is the right bike for many thousand people. But how can we communicate? Let us give it a try.</p>
<p>Your pledge also gives you the unique opportunity to have your very own HÜTTLIN E- Roadster which is offered at a good price here on Indiegogo. A lot of thought and planning went into it and we are really confident that this is the only e-bike that most of you need.  If you are an avid bike rider, think of the dangerous situations you sometimes face in traffic. A car cuts into your way. A bus did not see you. How about your survival skills? Everything has to happen very quickly, yet intuitively. And you know what helps most in a situation like this where a swift change of direction is your MUST? It is the light handling of your bike. Pledge for the HUTTLIN E-Roadster.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>WHY YOU NEED THIS E-BIKE</h3>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Multiply the destinations around you that you can possibly reach by pedal: Riding a bike is a great thing but with riding an e-bike multiplies your reach, you reach your destination with ease, you can go further and higher - across mountains and hills. An e-bike opens up the possibility for more people to use a bicycle for commuting and not just as a sport or hobby. We want to help congested cities to breathe again and encourage people to be more active and healthy.<br/></p>

<p>In the diagram above, you can see the different amounts of energy you'll need to climb hills - depending on the inclination of the hill and your cycling speed. This energy can come entirely from your own pedaling or with the help of the motor. For some, cycling seems like a daunting task. An e-bike can contribute most of the power you'll need on a normal ride and make the cycling journey less daunting, and even fun?</p>
<p>In summary, we offer a light weight e-bike that really excels. This is why the HUTTLIN E-Roadster is made for you, is made for everybody. If you want to be exclusive buy it now.<br/></p>

<h1><b>YOUR PLEDGE</b></h1>
<h4><b>AND THE ECONOMIES-OF-SCALE</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>When developing something new - as everyone knows there is a development cost. Only later when the product comes to the market, prices can drop thru production increases. The more you produce, the more numbers you buy of each part, the cheaper it gets. Similarly the more bikes we assemble, the more experience we obtain, the more efficient we become and the cheaper we produce. </p>
<p>This also means the more pledges we receive, the cheaper the bike will be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, our offer is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 1 and 10 pledges, the price of the bike starts at USD2999 for all contributors.</li>
<li>Between 11 and 20 pledges, the price of the bike will be reduced to USD 2899.</li>
<li>Between 21 and 40 pledges, the price of the bike will be reduced to USD 2799.</li>
<li>If we get 41 pledges and more, the price of the bike will be reduced to a final price of USD 2699 for all contributors.</li>
<li>To reserve a HÜTTLIN E-Roadster, each contributor must pledge USD 1699 as a downpayment during the course of the campaign. The balance will be paid at the end of the campaign.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Lead times:</span><br/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>For 1-5 e-bikes: 8 weeks</li>

<p>With this campaign, the
anticipated risks are:</p>
<p>•  Delay in
parts delivery – This is a real issue with any manufacturing process, whether
in large or small scale. But this is where our position of being in China and
speaking Chinese comes into great value because we will be able to follow up on suppliers and push for deadlines to be met.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Shipping and customs – Dealing with shipping and
customs is always tricky no matter the product. Our team has a lot of experience
with the shipping of electric bikes and often times the process runs smoothly
but it also happens that bikes get held up at customs and need inspection. If this happens it usually doesn't take more than a few days to clear. We cannot control these situations but we will do our very best to ensure that the bikes arrive as soon as possible to you. So far 100% of our past shipments have arrived
with our customers safe and sound. </p>

Normal E-Bikes weigh at around 25kg. The E-Roadster weighs 16.9kg/37.5lbs. This cool, rugged looking bike has all the makings of a faithful companion, made for your everyday commute. This is a reliable, durable, and most of all fun riding machine.Carbon electric bikes are rare so far, if any they retail for about USD 4,000 - USD 7,000. In this Indiegogo campaign, we offer you the chance to own your very own carbon electric bike with middle motor for USD 2999 (or less). It is all up to you!The components chosen for this bike are high level (also, we check and test ride every bike extensively). What is currently the best e-bike in the market? Hard to say, but: We think this one comes very close to it. First of all the weight is similar to a normal bike, and second it combines decent precision components, that have proven to be reliable with this fine riding machine. Think of the mid-motor only: it comes from the biggest manufacturer in the world. Never heard of? Well, check it out.Do you think you find a better ebike / Pedelec somewhere else? Let me say it: I don't think you will: See the Highlights of your HÜTTLIN E-RoadsterTOP 6 HIGHLIGHTS
1. CARBON COMPONENTS EVERYWHERE!
Weighing at only 16.9kg the E-Roadster owes its light weight to its bountiful carbon components, making it the number one highlight of this bike! As everybody knows Carbon is a modern compound material. The key feature of carbon is its great weight-to-strength ratio.  Carbon fiber has both phenomenal strength and superior fatigue resistance when compared to other commonly used materials such as aluminium or steel.The greatest benefit of a lightweight e-bike is easy handling. That means that you can treat this e-bike as you would a regular bike. The handling while riding is much more easy than a regular ""heavy-weight"" ebike. In addition, you can also easily lift the bike up a flight of stairs or lift it into your car.


2. MID-MOTOR PLUS INHOUSED SINE-WAVE CONTROLLER






A mid-drive system offers numerous technical advantages over a more traditional hub motor system, including:



Higher performance and torque - the motor drives the crank instead of the wheel. Imagine the gears on the bike as the gears on the motor. When driving up a hill, switching to a lighter gear allows you to maintain the same pedaling cadence which in turn allows the motor to run efficiently and provide more power.

Easy handling - the motor is positioned in the middle of the crank creating a low center of gravity. 

Easy maintenance - patch a flat tire the same way you would for a regular bike. 

The BBS01, 36V motor from Bafang (250W as Pedelec for Europe, 350W as ebike for the U.S.) is the chosen mid-motor on the E-Roadster. The BBS01 with its very high 80Nm torque provides ample power for you. This is 30% stronger than most other competitors!

For Europe the bike can be delivered as pedelec (limit 25kph) or speed-pedelec (limit 45kph). The price does not change.

The supplier factory of the mid-motor system named Suzhou Bafang is a well-run, high capacity factory that firmly holds its place as the biggest manufacturer of e-bike motors in the world (sales figures show 830,000 e-bike motors and 260,000 e-bike systems were sold in 2014 alone). We know the people well and we know the factory.
 
The motor comes with its own sine-wave controller integrated into the mid-motor case. It has a high max current of 15A/18A. Controllers are the intermediary between your commands on the display and the motor power. The display is your interface to motor performance. The controller receives your command from the display and tells the battery how much power (current) to channel into the motor. 

3. BIG LCD-DISPLAY GREAT VISUAL


The Bafang C961 is a 4""-LCD-Display that comes with great visual design. At a glance it gives you all information you need, including:  


Current Speed, max speed, avg. speed (km/h or miles/h), Powermeter

Duration and distance of a single trip
Total distance travelled
Battery level

The display can be read under direct sunlight or in the dark with its built-in backlight. 

The control buttons of display are right next to your thumb. Easy to control power (motor assistance level). 

You can also choose motor assist level 0 (PAS Level 0). The Display (Speedometer) is still operational.



4. RELIABLE BATTERY WITH USB-PORT



The 36V/12 Ah battery (with special USB-charging port for your electronic devices) is packed with Panasonic NCR18650 PF 2900mAh cells and is equipped with a battery management system (BMS) that protects the battery pack from overcharging and overheating. NCR18650 cells are also used in TESLA cars (thousands of pieces per battery pack) - in our batteries, it's 40 cells.
Additional features include a lock on the battery case to secure the battery against theft. There is also a battery charging level indicator.
To charge the battery, simply plug one end of the charger into the wall socket and connect the other end into the charging port on the battery case  – just like charging a laptop. You can easily remove the battery and charge it elsewhere, at home or in the office. Or you simply charge while the battery is on the bike.

5. SHIMANO DEORE 10-SPEED



The Shimano Deore 10-speed derailleur allows for precise gear shifting.  10 gears allow you to always adjust to the right pedaling speed (rpm) and this way enjoy the efficiency of you mid-motor. See our option below: We allow an upgrade with SRAM Dual Drive for around 200 Dollars. This will give you 27 gears. Internal gear ratios are 1:0.73   1:1  &  1:1.36. Please contact us for this great option!

6. HYDRAULIC DISC BRAKES WITH BIG DISK ROTORS



The Shimano hydraulic disc brakes with 180mm disc rotors for rear and 203mm for front provide a powerful and effective braking system for the E-Roadster. The brake levers are designed to cut-off the motor power when braking is applied. This ensures your safet and immediate stop even when using the motor's highest power.

With our experience and the successful co-operation with our suppliers around Shanghai, we have worked for several brands from other countries to produce their own bikes in China. But we have our own vision of the future. We want to realize this vision through our brand HÜTTLIN. The pledges we receive in this campaign will not only secure the development and consolidation of the carbon E-Roadster but will also help to develop other models that we would like to present to you and also offer to you. We think this direct communications is a wonderful way to offer you cheap the best you can get. Directly from the manufacturing line into your hands. Nobody else to earn money along the line. It is just your money to be saved.


HOW IT ALL STARTED:
Holger’s life as a cyclist started early. As a teenager, he attended a
boarding school for athletes and his sport was road cycling. His first bike was
an Italian ALAN, then Colnago, Muesing, fourth was an Eddy Merckx,
and the latest one which he still riding, a Belgium Duell with the fine parts of
Campagnolo Record.
Holger's education in Berlin and at Miami Adschool in South Beach, Florida gave him the foundation for creative design. Growing up in Germany and spending many years working alongside his father in their family's pharmaceutical machinery business taught him about Engineering and Good-Manufacturing-Practice. 
Holger was studying e-bikes for some time but it wasn’t until he came to
live in China that he bought his first mid-drive e-bike from a local
manufacturer in late 2011. Holger rode 14,000 km (approximately 8,700 miles) in
his first year. Although this e-bike came with its share of technical and
quality issues, Holger continuously worked to solve the issues and still owns this bike today.
As for Cheri, she came to China to study the Chinese language. And not too much  after startig Chinese class she worked in market research in small firm in Shanghai. After Cheri met Holger, Cheri was infatuated by Holger's passion for e-bikes and cycling, and together they run HÜTTLIN Pedelecs. Cheri is a great talent in Research and Organisation. Together they want to produce the best bikes - QUALITY - RELATIONSHIP - INNOVATION.
And that's how it all started.

Huttlin E-Roadster - leichtes Carbon E-Bike bei Indiegogo

TOTAL-QUALITY-MANAGEMENT

“Quality has its price but the absence of quality has a price much higher”
During the time Holger was studying the competitive advantage of German supermarket chain ALDI, he came across the works of the late Edward Deming. Deming used a scientific approach to quality management and his ideas and teachings of this fact is very powerful : Quality cannot be inspected, it can only be produced. 

We also believe that innovative and smart combinations of reliable and exciting components can make the most wonderful bikes for daily use. Holger and Cheri are always looking for intelligent ways to create an e-bike that is both beautiful and powerful.
We hope you are just as passionate about our ideas as we are and trust our commitment to deliver only quality bikes.


WHY INDIEGOGO? 
The contributors at Indiegogo have great empathy for start-ups and entrepreneurs who have a clear vision. 

The HÜTTLIN E-Roadster is a bike that is ready for mass production. With our experience and dedication we know we can make it a success not just for us, but for you too. We just need your help to get it out there. Let's make the earth a less polluted place and get you out of traffic and in shape. 


THE IMPACT
We want to explain more about our campaign, why it is so important to us and we want to let you know the difference your contribution will make.


We have some customized solutions that we would like to implement on the bike and the funds we raise in this campaign will help us do just that. Each pledge goes directly into the further development and consolidation of the carbon bike and also provides us funding for our next production that we want to share with you. We are convinced that the HUTTLIN E-Roadster is the right bike for many thousand people. But how can we communicate? Let us give it a try.
Your pledge also gives you the unique opportunity to have your very own HÜTTLIN E- Roadster which is offered at a good price here on Indiegogo. A lot of thought and planning went into it and we are really confident that this is the only e-bike that most of you need.  If you are an avid bike rider, think of the dangerous situations you sometimes face in traffic. A car cuts into your way. A bus did not see you. How about your survival skills? Everything has to happen very quickly, yet intuitively. And you know what helps most in a situation like this where a swift change of direction is your MUST? It is the light handling of your bike. Pledge for the HUTTLIN E-Roadster.

WHY YOU NEED THIS E-BIKE



Multiply the destinations around you that you can possibly reach by pedal: Riding a bike is a great thing but with riding an e-bike multiplies your reach, you reach your destination with ease, you can go further and higher - across mountains and hills. An e-bike opens up the possibility for more people to use a bicycle for commuting and not just as a sport or hobby. We want to help congested cities to breathe again and encourage people to be more active and healthy.

HOW MUCH ENERGY DO WE NEED: How far can I ride?




In the diagram above, you can see the different amounts of energy you'll need to climb hills - depending on the inclination of the hill and your cycling speed. This energy can come entirely from your own pedaling or with the help of the motor. For some, cycling seems like a daunting task. An e-bike can contribute most of the power you'll need on a normal ride and make the cycling journey less daunting, and even fun?
In summary, we offer a light weight e-bike that really excels. This is why the HUTTLIN E-Roadster is made for you, is made for everybody. If you want to be exclusive buy it now.


YOUR PLEDGE
AND THE ECONOMIES-OF-SCALE

When developing something new - as everyone knows there is a development cost. Only later when the product comes to the market, prices can drop thru production increases. The more you produce, the more numbers you buy of each part, the cheaper it gets. Similarly the more bikes we assemble, the more experience we obtain, the more efficient we become and the cheaper we produce. 
This also means the more pledges we receive, the cheaper the bike will be.

So, our offer is this:

Between 1 and 10 pledges, the price of the bike starts at USD2999 for all contributors.
Between 11 and 20 pledges, the price of the bike will be reduced to USD 2899.
Between 21 and 40 pledges, the price of the bike will be reduced to USD 2799.
If we get 41 pledges and more, the price of the bike will be reduced to a final price of USD 2699 for all contributors.
To reserve a HÜTTLIN E-Roadster, each contributor must pledge USD 1699 as a downpayment during the course of the campaign. The balance will be paid at the end of the campaign.



Lead times:


For 1-5 e-bikes: 8 weeks
For 6-15 e-bikes: 9 weeks
For 16-40 e-bikes: 11 weeks
For 41 and more e-bikes: 13 weeks



OPTIONS
To make us and our product more interesting for you and to give you choices we have thought of modular upgrades that really give more great value.
So, the other features to choose from are:


Tires: All terrain MTB tires with high profile pattern OR smooth slicks for everyday road riding quality - no extra charge.







SRAM Dual Drive upgrade to 27gears: 3 internal hub gears, 9 derailleur gears. Extra cost around 200 $.  The Dual Drive cassette: 11-36t. In the first gear the 36t cog equals to 49t. So your smallest gear, the first gear has a big cog in the rear hub equal to 49t, on the front chain wheel the smallest available is 44t. The gear ratios in the 3 internal gears of Dual Drive are: 
1st gear: 1:0.73; 2nd gear 1:1; 3rd gear 1:1.36

Handlebar grips: Regular round hand grips OR we can get you hand grips with extended horns, also made of rubber - no extra charge.  We personally think the best currently available. See photo here: 







Full Suspension front fork: If you decide that your Huttlin E-Roadster is made more for the trials than for the road you can choose a light full suspension aluminium fork (27.5"") - not extra charge.





Frame integrated Pro-Bag: Store your stuff inside this intelligent custom-made bag. For smartphone and bike lights to charge and other electronic devices. Also store your wallet and other personal belongings. Low extra charge of 99$. See below.




FOR TOURING GUYS - THE TRIANGE FRAME BAG
Upgrade this rugged Crossover Bike into a full-fledged touring bike. Create a lot of space where you can stash your personal stuff. Professional bike bags like the special frame-integrated battery bag offer you a lot more space than e-bikes normally offer. Apart from that your battery is protected. And don't forget you can charge smartphone or bike lights on the battery's USB-Port any time. Please contact us. Soon we want to offer those items here as an extra pledge. We can also offer you mobile front and rear lighting.



Don't you think those features we have prepared for you will give you a lot more great value to choose from? We do this all for you, for our customer.

COST OF SHIPPING AND IMPORT TAX & DUTIES 
We will ship by sea freight so that your shipping cost will not be too expensive. Delivery costs vary according to your location and also final number of bikes that can be shipped to each location. We promise we will not charge you more than USD350 for delivery charges to any location and final delivery charges will be updated closer to the shipping date. We also promise we will not overcharge you in any case. 
Import tax and duties are also different for different countries. Contact us to find out the import tax and duties for your country.

RISK & CHALLENGES OF OUR CAMPAIGN
With this campaign, the
anticipated risks are:
•  Delay in
parts delivery – This is a real issue with any manufacturing process, whether
in large or small scale. But this is where our position of being in China and
speaking Chinese comes into great value because we will be able to follow up on suppliers and push for deadlines to be met.
• 
Shipping and customs – Dealing with shipping and
customs is always tricky no matter the product. Our team has a lot of experience
with the shipping of electric bikes and often times the process runs smoothly
but it also happens that bikes get held up at customs and need inspection. If this happens it usually doesn't take more than a few days to clear. We cannot control these situations but we will do our very best to ensure that the bikes arrive as soon as possible to you. So far 100% of our past shipments have arrived
with our customers safe and sound. 

WARRANTY AND AFTER SALES SERVICE
We offer a 1 year warranty on the HÜTTLIN E-Roadster, except for wear and tear parts (such as tires). We will also help you afterwards, this is a promise.
In case of any faulty or defective parts, the warranty procedure is as follows:

Contact us and send us the details of the problem, including photos and videos where possible.
We will troubleshoot the problem with you and if the problem is not repairable, we will send you a spare part for free.


OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Please help us spread the word so we can focus on innovative e-bike technologies

THANK YOU!
We want to express our gratitude that you made it all the way down here to study everything we had to say. We really hope we could entertain you and be a great delivery company to you.
To prepare for this campaign we had help from an international team of friends and family. We
are most grateful for them. We want to express our special thanks to them –
they know who they are, they know how they helped us. 
We also want to thank you, dear customer and e-bike enthusiast for checking out our campaign. Your Contibutions and Pledges mean a lot to us. We thank you for your support.

Meet Göner:
 
The future of transport is here - faster, stronger, smarter than you previously hoped. It's versatile, modular and built with the highest-grade materials. Take it on airplanes, sidewalks, and in the rain. You can use it every day and charge it once a week with a USB cord.
Göner is perfect for the urban commuter of 2018. With a top speed of 22 mph / 40 kph, and a 20 mile / 35 km range, it will get you there in speed and security with versatility. Want to never wait for a bus again while keeping up with city traffic? No problem. Want to still take the bus or train, but save time travelling from station to door? No problem either.

I can't walk. So I scoot. Me on crutches (NYC), me with my former scooter (Sydney), me with göner (Zürich).
 
 

   

  
This scooter comes with an app that can tell you where you are going, how fast you are going there, and how far you have gone. It can also control your scooter and tell you if anything needs fixing.

Everyone should help combat the opioid epidemic, which has become the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50, a number which has doubled over the last 10 years. You can help by getting a Göner since 20% of all proceeds will be used to fund charitable addiction treatment programs, including giving free scooters to addicts with mobility issues. This will be done in partnership with Addicaid which is a company I founded that specializes in addiction treatment.
So get Göner today, and revolutionize your life while helping those suffering from addiction!",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The StewardTech Turbine: An Engine Without Equal.</h3>
<p>With our turbine, we have created what is without a doubt the next great step forward in transportation and propulsion, for everything from lawnmowers to locomotives and everything in between.</p>
<p>That's because we have developed patent-pending technology that makes our engine more efficient at higher output than anything else out there.</p>
<p>The StewardTech Turbine has higher efficiency than conventional piston engines found in gas-powered cars.  Our engine lasts longer and packs more horsepower relative to its size. Our turbine is a model of efficiency and durability while being environmentally friendly; the turbine itself can be used in wind and tidal generators, so it's greener, too. This turbine is a big winner, and you could become an essential part of the victory and scoring turbine-powered products for yourself, perhaps even securing the right to produce the turbine yourself (or license an individual or organization to produce it) at our guaranteed lowest royalty rate for the next 20 years. We expect this turbine to become the center of a multi-BILLION dollar business, so that right could become extremely valuable.</p>
<p><strong>Changing The Way The World Moves</strong></p>
<p>Our turbine engine can be scaled down to power a toy like a skateboard.  Or a lawnmower.  Or scaled up to power a locomotive.  Or an airplane or an automobile.  To scale, our technology can propel practically anything anywhere at average or even higher speeds but with greater potential for energy efficiency.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Makes the StewardTech Turbine Better</strong></p>
<p>The StewardTech Turbine is a centrifugal turbine with a bit of a twist. In most centrifugal turbines, the working fluid only acts once on the turbine vanes: when it contacts them. In our turbine, however, the working fluid remains active in the turbine for as long as it can do work in the turbine. It is therefore a long cycle turbine, which gives it the ability to transmit more energy to the turbine, which can make it more efficient than most centrifugal turbines.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518622187/nbg6opurjq98ti8hpuzd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The chief advantage of the StewardTech Turbine over axial and radial turbines is that the StewardTech turbine is a long cycle turbine, that is, the working fluid remains in the turbine until the maximum amount of energy is extracted from it. In an axial turbine, the working fluid passes through the turbine along its axis in a single pass. To make up for this, additional layers of blades or vanes are stacked one behind another to allow multiple extractions to take place. Unfortunately, that adds significantly to the size, weight and complexity of the turbine.</p>
<p>In a radial turbine, the working fluid passes through the turbine perpendicular to its axis. Again, this is a one-shot, all or nothing deal. The working fluid typically passes through the turbine with significant energy unextracted.</p>
<p>In the StewardTech turbine, the fluid moves neither axially nor as a one-shot radial pass as is the case with conventional engines.</p>
<p>Instead, the fluid in our engine is forced into a circular path around the outside of the turbine’s flow control surfaces. These surfaces are arranged radially in layers around the axis. This way, the centrifugal force operating on the working fluid forces the highest energy fluid to the outermost layer of flow control surfaces. By putting additional layers at smaller and smaller radii from the axis, multiple extractions can occur without changing the size of the turbine. By centering the exhaust port on the turbine’s axis, we ensure that only the lowest energy working fluid can exit the turbine. This allows a more efficient process in a smaller package.</p>

<p><strong>About The Company</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>In many ways, StewardTech is a different kind of company. We want to be so much more than just a place to build a career or make a buck. We want to be a place where we help our people to build rewarding lives, both inside and outside the company. It also helps us make better decisions along the way. We also want to create an environment of family. We firmly believe we were put here to serve one another, and to help one another along the road of life. Our unity is one of our greatest strengths.</p>
<p>We want to build products that make life better - in terms of being highly efficient and environmentally friendly. We want our products to use our natural resources more wisely, both in the production of the product and as it performs over its lifetime. We want to create for you not just products that do the job, but that do the job better with less waste along the way.  This is one way in which we can do our best to make the world a better place.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We have the design, we proved the technology and we filed the patents to prove it. Now we need to ramp up product and move the world in a whole new way.</p>
<p>That means we need hardware, software, facilities, and the ability to hire more people to get this done. Like any business venture, there is some risk here.  We perceive this as low risk as people the world over are open to new forms of transportation and the technologies behind them.  Consider the hybrid engine, the electric car and the driver-less car as relevant examples.</p>
<p>We know our design is technically sound and solid. We know beyond any doubt the potential value of our product far outweighs the risk. We're certain this turbine is a real winner, and when it goes into wide production, it will make people's lives better by reducing their fuel usage, and creating less pollution in the process.</p>
<p>The most important perk is not on our list. The most important perk is the knowledge that you made a difference in making life better for yourself, your children and your fellow man. Isn't that what makes life worthwhile? That said, look over the perks offered. Some of them are quite valuable such as our turbine-powered sports car.</p>
<p>So what happens if we don't get to our goal for this phase? Well, from a financial standpoint, we buy what we can with the funds from this campaign, and try to get funding for the rest of this phase elsewhere such as equity crowdfunding or an ICO.  Failure to get funding in this phase does NOT mean the project is dead. It only means we have to find other ways to to bring our vision to reality. We will make this happen, one way or the other. And we want you at the finish line with us when that first series of production turbines comes rolling off the line.</p>
<p>What happens if we completely overshoot the goal for this phase? We'll devote the extra funds to building more capacity. Whatever happens, every dollar we get will go towards funding the ongoing development of our engines to fit into every sector of industry. </p>
<p><strong>What If You Can't Afford To Be a Backer?</strong></p>
<p>So what if you cannot contribute financially? Well, whether you can contribute financially or not, you can still help out, and maybe in the process, take away a little bit of history for yourself:</p>
<p>Tell people about the turbine and about StewardTech. Talk to friends, relatives, coworkers and other associates about what we are doing here.

<h3>Design details</h3>
<p><strong>The triangle</strong></p>
<p>The rear triangle is manufactured in accordance with the Brompton's quality standards for titanium rear frame assemblies. The triangle has been tested by harsh everyday riding, folding and transporting around the snowy streets of Moscow.</p>
<p>With the triangle installed, the bicycle folds and unfolds as a standard Brompton.</p>
<p>The dropouts were designed with <strong>Rohloff</strong> and <strong>Alfine</strong> in mind, but you can also go with <strong>any standard internal hub</strong> or <strong>the cassette for an ultralight setup</strong>. <i>If you wish to do so, give us a shout to talk about derailleur hanger options. </i></p>
<p>There are M10 eyelets on the dropouts - they can be used to install Bob Nutz and the like for hauling a trailer. The triangle is compatible with a standard fender and rack with a bit of adjustment of the stays. The disk brake rotor should be 160 mm in diameter or less. There is also an option to keep the original caliper brake.</p>
<p><strong>The chain tensioner</strong></p>
<p>The chain tensioner is manufactured and assembled in house out of aluminium alloy and anodized black. It is designed to fit varying chain lines (from 46 mm to 56 mm) by simple adjustment of the jockey wheels's axles. The jockey wheels are a sourced quality product: CNC-machined aluminium with full ceramic bearings and are anodized black (<i>please disregard the silver ones pictured</i>). </p>
<p>The chain tensioner sits on top of the Shimano's anti-rotation washer. With the Rohloff, a nut (or a QR) just goes on top of the tensioner.</p>
<h3>Ordering and shipping</h3>
<p>We are launching production as soon as the campaign ends. You have the option to choose to get:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>our rear triangle alone</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>a kit with the included chain tensioner</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This production run, however big or small, will be ready to ship by the beginning of February, after the Russian New Year and Christmas holidays. This campaign does not have a strict go/no go threshold - we will fulfil any number of orders. The shipping will be handled by DPD - it is a safe, quick and reliable way to ship out of Russian Federation. </p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The triangle can be installed at home if Brompton's instructions are followed. The job is pretty straightforward and takes around 30 minutes, but expect to spend about an hour if you have never done this before. The triangle swap will require taking off the crankset. </p>

The triangle can be installed at home if Brompton's instructions are followed. The job is pretty straightforward and takes around 30 minutes, but expect to spend about an hour if you have never done this before. The triangle swap will require taking off the crankset. 
Warranty
Our rear triangle warranty is 5 years from the date of purchase and the chain tensioner's aluminium arms are covered with a 1 year warranty from the date of purchase. Each triangle has a serial number, which you will be able to register upon receiving your kit. 
The details of our Warranty Policy are covered in our docs section.
Communication
Please do ask any questions in the appropriate section of this campaign page and I will be happy to answer them. I will be updating this page with relevant information regarding the progress of the campaign, the production process, fulfilment and shipping. Stay in the know! 
I've also created our docs section for the sole purpose of posting relevant updates. Please feel free to post on our Facebook Page too.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't wish to order your Vostok triangle right now, please help us spread the word among fellow Brompton enthusiasts and share this campaign! The success of this campaign will help us design and build more accessories and components in the future. We are set to launch the production of custom titanium forks and rear racks for touring purposes.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>The 2008 Market Meltdown taught us, that we need a simpler alternative. Where any level of experience investor can understand, stay informed and visualize the financial light at the end of tunnel. In return allow our subsidiaries and potential trucking partners to provide one source transport solution to new or existing clients.</p>
<p>At Cargo Shares, we have developed a business model that is fairly simple and straightforward: lenders provide funding through our Cargo Shares Loan Chart, which entails loan requested amount, interest earned on each delivery and pre-determined vehicle amount. Funds provided cover vehicle purchase, operations, and maintenance for pending contract hauls. As we have all witness, the investment industry <i>does not care</i> about the people who are involved in it, paying attention only to executive bottom lines. Cargo Shares is the solution to this problem.</p>
<p>We have in place a<strong> 10-year exclusive hauling contract worth 5-6 million a year </strong>and have a few pending contracts. The business model upon which Cargo Shares operates would ensure that contracts such as this one <i>never</i> hang out limbo. Plus, all of our vehicles will be equipped with the latest technology, and participating lenders will have full access to GPS tracking, instant pick up, delivery notification messages, you will also be able to view daily, weekly, monthly and yearly productions.  There is no other method that is simple and effective that rewards lenders base on productivity of each vehicle. In addition these vehicles are activate on contracts.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>We have come to you, Indiegogo, for help raising $ 5,000,000.00. This start-up capital will cover the cost of vehicle, trailer and equipment acquisition, site improvement, technology, marketing and operation cost of launching our platform, which will make it possible not only for more lenders to participate in the transportation industry but also for everyone involved to take advantage of the latest technologies and innovations in the field.

<h3>Hello World</h3>
<p>We are Network Sorcery, a network solutions provider since 1999. Developing decoders and software applications for vehicles has been our focus for the past five years.</p>
<p>Our plans for expanding our vehicle decodes and applications further are very ambitious. Network Sorcery has the tech and know-how to bring more hardware to the table and inspire application development within our expanding community. Our goal is to provide a better decoding solution for vehicles than what OBD2 can produce. </p>
<p>We need your help to unify vehicle languages into a consistent set that is easy to use. We provide the tools that allow you to create and host applications for vehicle monitoring.</p>
<p>Please view our website for a full list of <a href=""http://networksorcery.com/ucan/tags.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">available tags</a>, and check out our supported <a href=""http://networksorcery.com/ucan/supported.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vehicle list</a></p>
<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>We have added the 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2016 Chevy Volt and 2016 Lexus RC as supported vehicles.</p>
<p>We now support graphical displays for Race Render 3 and Dashware. We can customize a video for your recorded test drives, please send a message detailing what you need.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the plan, we need capital to perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform test drives to collect research data.</li>
<li>Analyze the data we collect and expand our database of decodes for both currently supported as well as new vehicle models. This allows us to expand our coverage of tagged data to enable the applications you want to be developed.</li>
<li>Migrate UCAN to more hardware/software platforms. In particular, to provide an industrial strength solution as well as the research platform currently implemented on the Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>Create and support a backend for applications written by our community.</li>
<li>Develop applications to display data on (or from) external devices. Potentially includes third-party hardware integration.</li>
<li>To develop applications that can track location and performance data over time: such as tire monitoring, engine monitoring, preventative maintenance.</li>
<li>Enable existing compatible applications to be used in tandem with our displayed data.</li>
<li>Enable integrated safety, reminder, and alert applications within our user's connected network. This includes distributing sensor outputs to relevant applications and analyzing usage.</li>

<p>Our goal is to increase our coverage of performance data for the currently supported vehicles and expand the list of supported vehicles as requested by our community.</p>
<p>If we exceed the success threshold for this campaign, then the direction we take in expanding our support will be determined by votes for manufacturers and models for further exploration.</p>
<p>We are looking to our community to drive our development by voting for the vehicle lines that matter most to you.</p>
<p>The funding will be split between: adding more decodes for vehicle lines, expanding the number of vehicle lines supported, and adapting to new hardware/software platforms.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some assembly is required. The CAN adapter, case, video display, power supply, and vehicle interface cable are not included.</p>
<p>This is our experimental research grade version. We are currently developing an automotive grade version that could be a stretch goal tier but is currently not available.</p>
<p>This initial setup is intended for those of you that want a head start on developing applications and researching your vehicle(s).</p>

<h3>Expansion (aka stretch goals)</h3>
<p>The most basic and essential elements for the success of the UCAN system is for us is to expand our support to the widest variety of vehicles and the performance data they can provide.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The UCAN architecture consists of three pieces:</p>

<p>The data reader service reads raw data from a CAN-adapter that presents a Socketcan interface and publishes a stream of text strings containing the CAN data. </p>
<p>The data decoder subscribes to that data stream and outputs a stream of tag/value pairs that contains the decoded data. This data can then be utilized directly by applications.</p>
<p>The data reader and decoder reside on a Raspberry Pi, the applications can be run on any external device such as a cell phone, tablet, or another computer. </p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: Why did we choose the Raspberry Pi 3?</p>
<p>A: It is an impressive single-board computer. It has the performance and reliability needed for high volume decoding at a very affordable price.</p>
<p>Q: Why is native protocol decoding better than OBD2?</p>
<p>A: Since the data comes to us without requests it is the fastest possible way to extract data from the vehicle. Without generating requests, there is no possibility of interfering with normal vehicle operation. Finally, it allows us to process data that OBD2 has no access to.</p>
<p>Q: How many vehicles can I run the UCAN system on?</p>
<p>A: For personal use, users may use their license for up to four vehicles simultaneously. For fleets exceeding four vehicles, please contact us for a quote. </p>
<p>Q: Is there a subscription fee? (And how much is it)?</p>
<p>A: One free year of updates are included when UCAN is purchased. There is an optional $25 fee per year for additional updates.</p>
<p>Q: How can we contact your team?</p>
<p>A: For most questions, you can message Shawn Conner at shawnlconner@gmail.com. Ask anything you'd like regarding the UCAN project or about life in general. We're happy to help in anyway we can.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We did put a big front wheel 15 cm / 5.9 inches so you can feel the stableness of the board.<br/>The wheel has deep marks for off roading, we had many options when we had to choose the battery and we did go with the best quality battery out there <strong>Samsung Li-ion battery's.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the home of ATOM FLIYE
            
Idea for design and mobility is what made ATOM FLIYE as good as it is.We started to work with this project 18 months ago, we wanted to make the best hover board on the market but for a reasonable price.
ATOM FLIYE is not just a hover board, it is a transportation vehicle that will take you where ever you want, it doesn't matter if it is on the road or off road.
         
We did put a big front wheel 15 cm / 5.9 inches so you can feel the stableness of the board.The wheel has deep marks for off roading, we had many options when we had to choose the battery and we did go with the best quality battery out there Samsung Li-ion battery's.

Front Light
           
   Rear Light
           
You have both front and rear lights for safe hovering at night, it also swift it's place when you choose to turn your board, so you will always be safe and have the right light covering you.
        
We did the ATOM FLIYE hover board in four different colors so it can fit everyones style.The up scale shape is made to make your stay on the board comfortable and safe.
                            We didn't save on anything when it comes to safety and design
         
The material is carefully chosen by our team to keep the weight down and make it stronger and more durable, that's why went with aluminum alloy frame.

Aluminum frame for high quality and low weight
         
Hills, Dirt, Rock, Bumps?No problem, with your ATOM FLIYE these things is just fun to run over
        
Before all of this we had a long journey to make our idea into a complete product.This is Luke Wang, he is our technician, we want to salut him for all countless hours, days, months Wang has put into making our project  flawless.
                          
This image is from our early days while testing many of our prototypes before finding the perfect match components for ATOM FLIYE.
Our home made test ramp, ATOM FLIYE has been tested for different obstacles and surfaces.It's been a uphill but we have enjoyed every moment of it good and the worst :) 
                           
We don't want to deliver just a okay product,We want to present and deliver the perfect product.That's why we have done so many testings with many many components to finally finishing ATOM FLIYE.

You have to ride it to understand it.Surf the waves of the streets.

ATOM FLIYE'S StoryThis is me, just a simple guy that loves to travel around the world and meet new people and see new country's so who am I?My mom calls me Jamil and my friends for Jamie :) I was born and raised in Stockholm Sweden. 
The idea of ATOM FLIYE came when I traveled to Singapore 2 years ago, I notice that people in Singapore used different types of electric vehicle as a transportation for traveling to work or even the park, and I loved it so i wanted to make the ultimate electric transportation vehicle that can be used in all sorts of terrain and that's how ATOM FLIYE came into work.
Almost 2 years after I started my idea I'm here on Indiegogo asking your help to get ATOM FLIYE to the market so everyone can use it for transportation or just to have a lot of fun.
What I can promise if you contribute is that I will deliver the best high quality Hover Board on this planet for you, we have equipped everything on ATOM FLIYE with the best quality and high performance components.
 
We are also developing our ATOM FLIYE application for both iOS and Android
You can use the app to start your ATOM without touching your board via bluetooth, it will have a anti-theft so you can not turn on your ATOM without you first turning off the anti-theft function.
 
ATOM app will show you exact speed, milage and battery-life, it can also check the your ATOM'S condition so you always are safe to use it.

A great feature is that you can adjust everything on your ATOM, like the speed, power, sensitivity and much more with the app.

ATOM app will have tutorials on how to use the hover board, it will show how to begin and feeling out process to be a advanced driver.

Feel the POWER of your ATOM FLIYE

<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p>Mach1's patent-pending processes and technology have the potential to change the whole roadside assistance industry. </p>
<p>Mach1 is solving pain points for customers, service providers and also for businesses that currently offer roadside assistance. Mach1 has a business to business offering in which dealerships, insurance companies, and even auto clubs can white-label or license their patent-pending technology. The offering is expected to save companies money in dispatch, accounting, and all the time to execute those processes, not to mention improve customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Technology is moving the roadside assistance industry in a new direction,” said Founder and CEO Rick Narpaul, “Our hope to is to create a new standard across the industry.”</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our app not only changes the experience for the consumer but also brings opportunities to service providers. You don't need a tow truck to bring someone fuel or even change a tire opening up doors for just about anyone to be a part of Mach1. Our model especially allows industry providers to save time and money. *Mach1 is veteran-owned &amp; veteran providers supported.</p>

<h3>The Difference</h3>

<p>There are some giant companies in this space. None of them have an automated dispatch process like us.  In a $9 Billion dollar industry, it's hard to believe technology is not leveraged more. That's why we're disrupting the industry to make some much-needed changes for everyone. </p>
