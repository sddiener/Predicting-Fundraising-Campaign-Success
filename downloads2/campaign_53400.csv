<h2>The Introduction</h2>
<p>Most water bottles are rather uninspired. They’re throwaway marketing materials from companies, or cheap containers that get moldy too quickly. And the ones that are great are either terribly expensive or filled with too many unnecessary features to count.</p>
<p>That’s why we are starting Calabash: A beautifully designed, minimalist water bottle with a cause.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509485422/evxb3feahptcaflwhldr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Calabash Bottle</h3>
<p>First, it’s light and portable, perfect for fitting in the side of a backpack or the cup holder of your car. Its matte outer coating makes it easy to grip and handle. An eco-friendly stainless steel interior ensures that your water will taste exactly as it should, whether it’s hot or cold. But if you don’t want it to taste like water, then an included removable infused filter will let you add flavoring or brew your coffee or tea in it. And wouldn’t you want your ice chilled smoothie or your hot coffee to stay the same temperature throughout a long day? Calabash uses double walled vacuum insulation technology to retain the temperature of whatever you place in the bottles for over 48 hours. </p>
<p>However, the part that we’re most excited about Calabash is our cause.</p>

<p>One day, on one of our many trips, we passed by a group of school kids who were drinking what looked like coffee from a small calabash which they passed around.

Most water bottles are rather uninspired. They’re throwaway marketing materials from companies, or cheap containers that get moldy too quickly. And the ones that are great are either terribly expensive or filled with too many unnecessary features to count.
That’s why we are starting Calabash: A beautifully designed, minimalist water bottle with a cause.

The Calabash Bottle
First, it’s light and portable, perfect for fitting in the side of a backpack or the cup holder of your car. Its matte outer coating makes it easy to grip and handle.

Calabash uses double walled vacuum insulation technology to retain the temperature of whatever you place in the bottles for over 48 hours. 
However, the part that we’re most excited about Calabash is our cause.

They were beautiful, but they leaked through the knots in the wood. </p><p>I went to visit some Amish craftsmen who I’ve worked with on other projects.

When placed in a jar with your drink of choice, the wood rehydrates and the coil expands to fill the jar. This solution has many advantages over traditional barrels:</p><ul>
<li>No leaks, no headaches - Barrels need to be hydrated and conditioned before use, and often still leak. With the glass jar, you only get a small amount of evaporation.</li>
<li>Experiment with different woods - With barrels, you get oak. That’s it. Don’t let our name fool you - try Fifth In Oak kit using sugar maple, cherry wood, or hickory to add another layer of flavor to your creation.</li>
<li>See the progress - The glass jar allows you to see your beverage changing color inside, so it’s easier to track the progress and see how much is left inside.</li>
<li>Way more versatile - The glass jar is easier to fill and empty, and it’s wide enough to add things like fruit so you can infuse your spirit as it ages.</li>

</ul></div>","My name is Tom, and I love crafting the perfect drink. I started bartending the day after I turned 21, and there’s something deeply rewarding about bringing flavors together in a way that’s perfectly, uniquely yours.Like a lot of you, I began experimenting with barrel aging - both at home and as part of a bar program. I quickly discovered that barrel-aging, as we do it today, just didn’t make sense. Mini barrels for home and bar use are expensive, leaky, and hard to use. I wanted to find a better way. As a lifelong woodworker, I started experimenting with different woods and different sized containers. I even made a 750ml bottle out of white oak, lightly charred inside. They were beautiful, but they leaked through the knots in the wood. I went to visit some Amish craftsmen who I’ve worked with on other projects. Daniel, one of the family’s sons who I had come to know and respect, began working with me to solve this… and we did.  What we created is a thin slice of Missouri white oak (or cherry, sugar maple, or hickory) that’s charred on both sides, then steamed and curled to fit in a jar. When placed in a jar with your drink of choice, the wood rehydrates and the coil expands to fill the jar. This solution has many advantages over traditional barrels:
No leaks, no headaches - Barrels need to be hydrated and conditioned before use, and often still leak. With the glass jar, you only get a small amount of evaporation.
Experiment with different woods - With barrels, you get oak. That’s it. Don’t let our name fool you - try Fifth In Oak kit using sugar maple, cherry wood, or hickory to add another layer of flavor to your creation.
See the progress - The glass jar allows you to see your beverage changing color inside, so it’s easier to track the progress and see how much is left inside.
Way more versatile - The glass jar is easier to fill and empty, and it’s wide enough to add things like fruit so you can infuse your spirit as it ages.
Fits in a fridge - Want to experiment with perishable ingredients? Stick your jar in the fridge while it’s aging.
Multiple uses - the wood coils are good for about 3 uses. Make the same thing 3 times or mix things up - the flavor of your first batch will add depth to your next creation.
  This is Fifth in Oak… barrel aging with all the taste and none of the time, cost, or waste.We’re especially excited about all the unique ways we’re already seeing people use (and re-use) Fifth in Oak! Here are just a few ideas that inspired us…

Zur Erreichung dieses Ziels müssen wir die folgenden HAUPT-Anfangskosten decken: Miete: Ladenlokal/Küche, Ausstattung, Inventar (erlesene Schokolade aus aller Welt, Nostalgie-Süßigkeiten), Kakaobohnen: UTZ-zertifiziert, Direktbezug vom Amsterdamer Hafen sowie andere, natürliche Zutaten.

Wir werden ausschließlich <a href=""https://utz.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UTZ-zertifizierte</a> Kakaobohnen kaufen, damit wir uns sicher sein können, dass unsere Schokolade nur aus den besten Kakao-Anbaugebieten der Welt kommt. Denn dort beherrscht und pflegt man die Kunst der Schokoladenherstellung seit Jahrhunderten. Bei uns haben Sie die Wahl zwischen Bitter-, Zartbitter- und Milchschokolade. Unsere derzeitige Sorte zeichnet sich in der 81-83% VEGANEN Bittervariante durch einen reichhaltigen, leicht rauchigen Schokoladengeschmack mit milder Säure aus. Der Abgang ist weich und ausgewogen, mit fruchtigen bis bitteren Noten. Die Zartbittervariante mit 51-58% Kakaogehalt schmeckt unverkennbar schokoladig und besticht durch nachhaltige Vanillenoten, abgerundet mit einem Hauch von Karamell . In unserer Milchschokolade mit einem Anteil von 35-40% Kakao schmeckt man die gelungene Mischung aus Zucker, frischer Milch und Vanille.</p><p> </p><h2>Der Effekt</h2><p>Hallo...? Schokolade! Aber mal im Ernst... Schokolade! Okay, Spaß beiseite. Wir möchten ganz einfach einzigartige Schokolade herstellen die Spaß macht und dabei <strong>unsere Kohlenstoffbilanz so niedrig wie möglich</strong> <strong>halten.</strong> Im Moment gibt es kein Geschäft dieser Art im Schillerkiez, das Premium-Schokolade oder Fertigungs- und Produktionsdienstleistungen für kleine Auflagen anbietet, einschließlich speziell angefertigter Schokolade und anderen Esswaren.</p><p> </p><h2>Wie können Sie uns helfen?</h2><p>Teilen Sie dieses Projekt mit Ihren Freunden und Ihrer Familie auf Ihren Social Media-Plattformen. Je mehr Leute davon erfahren, desto wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass wir unser Projekt umsetzen können. Daher bedanken wir uns schon um Voraus für jede Hilfe bei der Verbreitung.</p><p> </p><h2>Risiken und Herausforderungen</h2><p>Mit der Anschaffung unserer Premier Stein-Mühle und dem Erlernen des Schokoladen-Temperier-Prozesses haben wir die Voraussetzung geschaffen, Schokolade selbst herzustellen. Unser größtes Hindernis ist demnach die Fein-Abstimmung der Werkzeugausstattung und Fertigung unserer eigenen Spritzgussteile.

Hier im Kiez gibt es wirklich alles - nur kein Geschäft für erlesene Schokolade oder Süßigkeiten. Das möchten wir ändern. Wir denken dabei nicht an ein Süßigkeitengeschäft im herkömmlichen Sinne, sondern haben vielmehr vor, moderne DIY-Fertigungs- und Produktionsmethoden in unseren Prozess einzubinden. Denn dann können wir: unsere eigenen, individuellen Formen und damit auch einzigartige Designs herstellen, zeitnah reagieren, sowie Fertigungs- und Produktionsdienstleistungen für kleine Auflagen in der Nachbarschaft anbieten. Ganz egal, ob Sie nach etwas Süßem für die Kleinen suchen, nach einem Geschenk für den Liebsten oder die beste Freundin oder ob Sie vielleicht eine eigene Idee haben, die Sie umsetzen möchten - ZuckerPapi ist die Lösung!  Was wir brauchenDa ich über fundierte Berufserfahrung im Design und 3D-Modellieren verfüge könnten wir mit den richtigen Geräten unsere eigenen Gießformen anfertigen. Dadurch könnten wir unsere Kosten drastisch reduzieren und darüber hinaus langfristig eine Dienstleistung für die Nachbarschaft anbieten. Zur Erreichung dieses Ziels müssen wir die folgenden HAUPT-Anfangskosten decken: Miete: Ladenlokal/Küche, Ausstattung, Inventar (erlesene Schokolade aus aller Welt, Nostalgie-Süßigkeiten), Kakaobohnen: UTZ-zertifiziert, Direktbezug vom Amsterdamer Hafen sowie andere, natürliche Zutaten. Dann muss noch Bienenwachs und biologisch angebauter, individuell bedruckter Baumwollstoff angeschafft werden. Was Sie bekommen... Unser erstes Marken-Schokoladen-Produkt SchokoKiezSchokoladentafeln in der Form Ihres KiezHaben Sie Ihren Kiez zum Fressen gern? Nun... das können Sie jetzt wörtlich nehmen! Unsere erste SchokoKiez-Tafel ist unserem Heimat-Schillerkiez gewidmet (siehe unten). Während der letzten paar Monate haben wir dieses Produkt von Grund auf entwickelt und Prototypen hergestellt. Wir sind jetzt soweit, dass wir es auf den Markt bringen können. Rechtzeitig zur Weihnachtssaison 2019 werden wir alle SchokoKiez-Tafeln herausbringen (vollständige Liste siehe unten). Schillerkiez verpackt in Bioplastik Vollständige Kiez-Liste - 10 verschiedene Berliner Kieze (Bergmannkiez, Boxhagener Kiez, Brunnenstrkiez, Kollwitzkiez, Körnerkiez, Nollendorfkiez, Reuterplatz, Rixdorf, Schiller & Wrangelkiez)  Die SchokoladeWir sind uns bewusst, dass Ihnen Qualität und Geschmack wichtig sind. Wir werden ausschließlich UTZ-zertifizierte Kakaobohnen kaufen, damit wir uns sicher sein können, dass unsere Schokolade nur aus den besten Kakao-Anbaugebieten der Welt kommt. Denn dort beherrscht und pflegt man die Kunst der Schokoladenherstellung seit Jahrhunderten. Bei uns haben Sie die Wahl zwischen Bitter-, Zartbitter- und Milchschokolade. Unsere derzeitige Sorte zeichnet sich in der 81-83% VEGANEN Bittervariante durch einen reichhaltigen, leicht rauchigen Schokoladengeschmack mit milder Säure aus. Der Abgang ist weich und ausgewogen, mit fruchtigen bis bitteren Noten. Die Zartbittervariante mit 51-58% Kakaogehalt schmeckt unverkennbar schokoladig und besticht durch nachhaltige Vanillenoten, abgerundet mit einem Hauch von Karamell . In unserer Milchschokolade mit einem Anteil von 35-40% Kakao schmeckt man die gelungene Mischung aus Zucker, frischer Milch und Vanille. Der EffektHallo...? Schokolade! Aber mal im Ernst... Schokolade! Okay, Spaß beiseite. Wir möchten ganz einfach einzigartige Schokolade herstellen die Spaß macht und dabei unsere Kohlenstoffbilanz so niedrig wie möglich halten. Im Moment gibt es kein Geschäft dieser Art im Schillerkiez, das Premium-Schokolade oder Fertigungs- und Produktionsdienstleistungen für kleine Auflagen anbietet, einschließlich speziell angefertigter Schokolade und anderen Esswaren. Wie können Sie uns helfen?Teilen Sie dieses Projekt mit Ihren Freunden und Ihrer Familie auf Ihren Social Media-Plattformen. Je mehr Leute davon erfahren, desto wahrscheinlicher ist es, dass wir unser Projekt umsetzen können. Daher bedanken wir uns schon um Voraus für jede Hilfe bei der Verbreitung. Risiken und HerausforderungenMit der Anschaffung unserer Premier Stein-Mühle und dem Erlernen des Schokoladen-Temperier-Prozesses haben wir die Voraussetzung geschaffen, Schokolade selbst herzustellen. Unser größtes Hindernis ist demnach die Fein-Abstimmung der Werkzeugausstattung und Fertigung unserer eigenen Spritzgussteile. Jetzt gilt es zu ermitteln, ob wir ein Gusswerkzeug aus Aluminium brauchen, oder ob es vielleicht auch mit 3D-gedruckten ABS-Formen funktioniert.  Obwohl ich im Umgang mit Programmen wie TinkerCAD sehr versiert bin, werde ich mich weiterbilden, um künftig auch Fusion360 zu erlernen. Unsere Ausstattung und Geräte werden wir selber bauen. Die Open-Source-Pläne dazu findet man online: Precious Plastic. Hilfe bei der Anfertigung holen wir uns von der Berliner Firma für Kunstproduktion s-hamacher. Als Studenten der Youtube-Universität für uns kein Problem. Darüber hinaus ist die Anzahl an informativen Videos und Tutorials für alles Mögliche schier unendlich. Wir müssen unseren Recycling-Prozess durch die EFSA - europäische Behörde für Lebensmittelsicherheit genehmigen lassen. D.I.Y.Abschließend möchten wir betonen, dass bei diesem Projekt der Aspekt des Selber-Machens, der DIY-Spirit, im Vordergrund   steht.

<p><i><strong>Hi! My name is Liam, co-founder of L Bros CBD.</strong></i>  What is a CBD?  Well in our case, it stands for Cancer Battling Duo.  I am 9 years old and this is my story. </p>
<p>Almost 2 years ago, when I was young, I started growing my hair so I could donate it to kids with cancer.  It was miserable.  Hot during the summers, it's always in my face, the pain of brushing it out in the shower and my parents yelling at me because of the knots…  I also hated being called, “sweety”, “honey” and “little girl”.  Finally, when it reached 10 inches all around, I  got it cut.  I needed to find an easier, quicker, and less painful way to help kids my age.    </p>
<p>I thought to myself, what else can I do to help?  So, I enlisted my younger brother Leo to help me start a new company to help kids.  Leo’s favorite thing is candy and what kid doesn’t like candy?  The doctor’s office always gives me a lollipop when I leave, so it must make kids get better, right?  I read a lot of articles about something called CBD’s and how they are REALLY helping people.  Let’s put CBD’s into candy.  So, Leo and I came up with our slogan, CANCER BATTLING DUO. </p>
<p>I asked my parents to help me make a lollipop that tastes good and has CBD’s in it.  Something a kid my age would want to eat that could also help them.  So, with EVERY lollipop sold, we will donate the equivalent of one lollipop to a children's cancer charity. </p>
<p><i><strong>Hi!  My name is Leo, co-founder of L Bros CBD.</strong></i>  My brother already told you a little bit about our company.  I am 6 and a half years old.   I will tell you my story and how I learned about this amazing thing called CBDs.   </p>
<p>About two years ago, my Nana was diagnosed with cancer and a brain tumor.  After surgery on the brain, she suffered from a stroke.  My family had to move to California from New York City to take care of her.  I saw the nurses rubbing cream on my Nana.  I asked about it because it seemed to help her.  They told me it has something called CBD in it.  I did not know what that was, but I saw it made a huge difference.  </p>
<p>I went to my big brother Liam and told him about it…  He told me that he has been doing research on CBD and thinks they will help people.  I told him about what the nurse told me and Nana’s CBD cream and how it works for her. </p>
<p>Liam told me of his idea and asked if I would help.  Ummm… of course!  I told him I liked candy and I think most people do to…  Why don’t we make a candy.  Then Liam said that lollipops must be good for you since we get one from our doctor on the way out.  So, we looked at each other and said, YES!  Lollipops with CBD!  We can help so many kids now!  That is when the L Bros Cancer Battling Duo first started.  We are just finishing our new websites:  LBrosCBD.com  and LBrosConfections.com  <i><strong> WE ARE DOING THIS OURSELVES WITH VERY LITTLE HELP FROM OUR PARENTS!</strong></i>  Help us  - help kids - <strong><i>making healing a little sweeter!</i>™  </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>endless possibilities</i></p>
<p>In late 2018, I somehow became so addicted to coconut water. Not just any coconut water, but one from a specific strain. Distinctively aromatic and sweet. Almost like a flower or fruit nectar, but clearer, and more delicate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this idea of turning it into some kind of portable product so I could carry it everywhere suddenly became one of my top priorities. And so it begins. Those few months after were  nothing, just binge visiting coconut plantations to find the best supplier. That's is also a reason why I've decided to use the scene of a river canal near the coconut plantation as an integral part of the packaging design. It reminds me of the journey. Eventually, the perfect grower was found. They are a small grower who harnessed technology enhanced harvest technique to produce consistently harvest the right coconut. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here comes the most difficult part, turning it into a viable, portable, drinking solution. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the past year, I've been peeking through every corners of the food science realm; oven-dried, sun-dried, spray dried. None work quite like this latest discovery, the cryogenic sublimation process. Even with the right method, we were failing to yield a high quality fine-grained flakes because coconut water is a delicate subject. Slightly wrong temperature and the difference in flavor is blatantly noticeable. The only way to comprehensively preserve the taste is that the super delicate coconut water must never been exposed to excessive heat. (Video below)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After initial testing,  it is super exciting to finally be able to share this wonderful drink!</p>

The product

The journey

The result
 

  
our CRYOGENIC SUBLIMATION process perfectly preserves taste, nutrients, and smell

endless possibilities
In late 2018, I somehow became so addicted to coconut water. Not just any coconut water, but one from a specific strain. Distinctively aromatic and sweet. Almost like a flower or fruit nectar, but clearer, and more delicate.
 
So this idea of turning it into some kind of portable product so I could carry it everywhere suddenly became one of my top priorities. And so it begins. Those few months after were  nothing, just binge visiting coconut plantations to find the best supplier. That's is also a reason why I've decided to use the scene of a river canal near the coconut plantation as an integral part of the packaging design. It reminds me of the journey. Eventually, the perfect grower was found. They are a small grower who harnessed technology enhanced harvest technique to produce consistently harvest the right coconut. 
 
Here comes the most difficult part, turning it into a viable, portable, drinking solution. 
 
Over the past year, I've been peeking through every corners of the food science realm; oven-dried, sun-dried, spray dried. None work quite like this latest discovery, the cryogenic sublimation process. Even with the right method, we were failing to yield a high quality fine-grained flakes because coconut water is a delicate subject. Slightly wrong temperature and the difference in flavor is blatantly noticeable. The only way to comprehensively preserve the taste is that the super delicate coconut water must never been exposed to excessive heat. (Video below)
 
After initial testing,  it is super exciting to finally be able to share this wonderful drink!

 




 

 
What We Need & What You Get

The funding will go directly into sourcing a large batch of high quality aromatic coconut water and get the machine up and running
All fundings will be returned if we don't reach our goal

Risks&Challenges
The proposed delivery is in March 2021, but delay is possible considering how COVID-19 situation is affecting the global logistic industry. We will try our best :)

<h2>In CHEEZUS we trust!</h2>
<p>I'm Ross and I'm a cheese-o-holic. Yes, they say the first step to overcoming your problem is admitting it. So there we have it. In fact, my whole family is a bit cheese mad. We're from the UK but based in France, two of the best countries for cheese in the whole world. </p>
<p>I always say I have ADBD (attention deficit business disorder) because, like a poorer, less famous Elon Musk, I can't stop thinking of things that the world needs. So with a family of cheese nuts, and equally wine lovers, we found ourselves questioning why CHEEZUS doesn't currently exist? </p>
<p>Having worked on many start ups, this ain't my first rodeo. </p>
<h3>What is CHEEZUS?</h3>
<p>As previously everything was the ""Uber of X"" I am hailing this the Vivino of cheese. You take a picture of your precious cheese laid out on your plate, the Cheezus app will tell you what that cheese is, and more importantly what goes with that cheese. </p>
<p>- What to eat with it; such as fruit pairings, pickles and chutneys as well as which bread and cracker types.</p>
<p>- What to drink with it; whether it's red, white or port, we have suggestions for the best cheesegasm experience. </p>
<p>On top of this, there are opportunities to provide suggestions on similar types of cheese to you. You know you're a Brie lover, but did you know of Rochebaron? A mild and creamy blue that will knock your cheese socks off. Great with a drop of New World Pinot Noir! <br/> </p>
<h3>Other features of the app include: </h3>
<p>Cheese events near you</p>
<p>Highlighted cheese restaurants of note</p>
<p>Cheese recipe suggestions </p>
<p>Cheese blog posts from contributors and sponsors</p>
<p>This has now developed into more of a family project, too. My 14 yr old son has been doing the feature analysis between free and pro versions of the app, while he's also helping me get the website up and running. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Are We Raising &amp; Why?</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise €25,000 so we can bathe in cheese and create a family of cheese monsters to take over the world. OK, not true, but the €25,000 is. </p>
<p>So how WILL it be used? That's simple: </p>
<p><strong>Development of the iOS app v1.0</strong> - €5000: This also includes all the backend functionality that can be used for the next step Android app, to such as; user profile Db, image recognition API (work out what cheese is what) and recommendation engine. </p>
<p><strong>Development of Android app v1.0</strong> - €2500: With the backend stuff already being handled, this will be an easier undertake but still an important step, we can't have Android peoples missing out on CHEEZUS! </p>
<p><strong>Corporate Setup - €2500: </strong>The boring stuff. Apparently if you build something you have to do it properly, and this means a corporate structure and legal entity that Cheezus sits under. World domination requires serious planning, and we have this covered. </p>
<p><strong>Marketing - €10,000 :</strong> Organic growth is one thing, but when you've run out of growthhacking blogs to read to try and get your app out there, and your friends and family block you on all social platforms for forcing them to download Cheezus, you need to bring out the big guns! </p>
<p><strong>Further App Development €5000 </strong>: But you've already built it? Yes, but getting it out there is one thing, the development needs to make sure we can have both free and paid versions of the app. This requires some further feature development and that requires some coinage. </p>
<h3>What will YOU get for investing in CHEEZUS? </h3>
<p>Apart from bringing something to market that the world needs, we wanted to line up some unique offerings to you guys as well. </p>
<p><strong>BRIETA Testers!</strong> Yes, I just used that pun. You guys will have the chance to be the first to use and test the apps. With this it will give you a chance to make suggestions on new features and ideas for the Cheezus app. </p>
<p><strong>Access to the exclusive CHEEZUS community.</strong> We're creating a whole space where people can help us make this everything the world needs, and you'll be at the forefront of that as Chief Cheese Officers. Ambassadors of cheese. A role like no other. This will open you up to opportunities within the Cheezus model; You can be a cheese contributor within the app, promoter in your area, city, or country. Cheese event team? You got it. These opportunities will come to all of you guys first! </p>
<p><strong>Free CHEEZUS Pro</strong>: Goes without saying, that you get the app as a part of your amazing contribution, right? </p>
<p><strong>Cheezus Merch:</strong> We have to have merch and nothing quite says Cheezus without great items. You have the choice between tshirts, hoodies and stickers with such great taglines as: In Cheezus We Trust, and ALL HAIL CHEEZUS, Y'all need CHEEZUS... Oh yes, we spent some time on those! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Happens If You Don't Hit Your Goal?</h3>
<p>Like all good plans, you always need to make sure you build different scenarios into this, so we've done that. We will always aim to deliver the app as a no.1 priority. We can scale back first features and ensure we get a release out. Let's face it, as soon as Buzzfeed gets an eye full of the Cheezus goodness, we've got viral written all over us. </p>
<h3>Without YOU, The World Won't See CHEEZUS!</h3>
<p>That's right, we need you. As much as we can do on our own, to get this out there and fully built, we can't do it without you. </p>
<p>How many times have you been in the position where you as a cheese lover, doesn't know what cheese to pick in a restaurant, or store? Or, you're tired of the same old cheeses you eat but don't know where to turn next? </p>
<p>Don't even get me started on what to eat and drink with our cheeses. Bored of the same pickles and Tuck biscuits? You'll become a next level cheese boss with the help of your cheesy friend, Cheezus.</p>
<p>We're obviously very lighthearted through all of this, but the fact remains we have total belief in this, it's no joke and we have the experience and expertise to get this amazing opportunity out there, we just need that little (read: huge) kick to get this into peoples' hands, and to the top of the app store! (It's happening, I'm telling you!) </p>
<h3>Risks?</h3>
<p>The main challenges we face are technology challenges, but my background is IT and also product/ project management, so technical problem solving is kinda my bag. If something comes up that throws a challenge, there is always a solution and way to make it work. </p>
<p>I have planned out exactly what technologies and backend the app will use and all of it has been utilised in other projects I've delivered (an app that uses image recognition to analyse goats, yes, you read that right, as well as educational analytics that use facial expression recognition to analyse students engagement - yea, we've got this one!)</p>
<p>Another potential challenge is funding and scaling, but the technology will be developed to allow scaling for user growth, and the product development will be built using lean product development where we can ensure we continue to deliver at the most efficient and cost effective way. I've bootstrapped every startup I've worked on, so working to tight budgets is what I do.</p>
<h3>Other Ways to Help?</h3>
<p>I know asking for investment is not always easy for everyone, we get that, we really do, but it's more than just about the financial help. A big part of any launch is about the marketing help, too and that is where everyone can contribute. All it takes is a share of this campaign on your social feeds, or the odd #Cheezus mention and tag, and we'll spread faster than hot butter on a crumpet.</p>
<p>Remember you can use the Indiegogo sharing functionality to help us get this project around the world. </p>

<h3>In America, we have a problem with the food cycle. It's in reverse.</h3>
<p>My name is James Williams and I'm the co-founder of Good Food Direct. Good Food Direct wants to make healthy food affordable to all Americans, and we need your help to make it happen. We believe that through technology and innovation, we can reverse the food cycle in America; help our environment and improve the lives of millions of Americans in the process. Let me tell you how I learned about the value of good food.</p>
<p>I have been an athlete for the majority of my life. My college weight was around 175lbs and 4% body fat. After college I was fortunate to land a good job. That good job lead to the good life. Before I knew it, after one year I had ballooned to 256lbs. I had gotten fat. I had less energy, I couldn't think as clear, and wanted to stay home more than I wanted to go out. Then something happened that would change my life forever. I got a job offer to work and live in Asia.</p>
<p>I had been working and living in Asia for year before I came home for the holidays. I didn't know the shock I was in for. Upon arriving home my mother looked at me in anguish and couldn't believe her eyes. She had asked me if I was ok and if everything was alright. Puzzled, I asked her why. She said ""because you lost so much weight."" I hadn't realized it, but when I jumped on the scale, I had lost 80lbs. In one years time, without any exercising, I had returned to my normal weight. My mom thought they were starving me. In reality, I had never eaten so much in my life. I routinely ate 5-6 meals a day. I began to analyze how I managed to lose the weight. That's when it hit me. It was the food. While living in Asia, I always ate good healthy food daily. Fruits and vegetables picked that day. Fish caught that morning. Chicken slaughtered in the noon market. Fresh food made all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>That's when  I began researching and learning about the relationship between food and health. I learned that eating good healthy food was not only good for the body, but also for the environment. I realized that like most American's, I had the food cycle in reverse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we need your help to get American's back on track, and to reverse the food cycle.</p>
<p><u><strong>Who We Are:</strong></u></p>
<p>Good Food Direct believes that every American should have access to affordable good food. There are two big obstacles that stand in the way of Americans having affordable good food:</p>
<p>1. Cost – Good food is not expensive. Unnecessary cost are added to the food chain that makes it more expensive to obtain by some Americans.<br/>2. Access – How do we get affordable good food to All Americans</p>
<p>Good Food Direct (GFD) has a solution to the problem. We cut cost to the bear minimum by buying directly from the producers and manufactures, passing that savings directly to our customers. Our customers will save between 20-45% of grocery store prices. We also use an affordable delivery model to get Americans good food at the least delivery cost. We also use proprietary data analytics to empower you to make better buying decisions.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Technology:</strong></u></p>
<p>GFD utilizes a proprietary Data Algorithm we call ADAM. Think of ADAM as your intelligent shopping guide that only gets smarter the more you and your family uses it. By filling out a short registration form, ADAM will save you time and money, and help you reduce your food cost, and more importantly your food waste.</p>
<p>This is an example of how it works. As you begin to place your order, our algorithm records the types of food you buy, how often you buy the food, how much you spend on your food and the frequency at which you buy it. Every time you shop online, instore or though the app, ADAM will inform you of any special deals, allow you to view and/or order from previous orders, alert you if you can save money by buying an item(s) in bulk or by the case and alert you if your spending or buying is outside of your norms. This is just a small example of what ADAM can do.</p>
<p>You will be able to shop our grocery store in person, online, or via our app. All with equal efficiency.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Social Mission:</strong></u></p>
<p>At GFD we believe that charity begins at home. By home we mean the communities were Americans live and work. We belief that Good affordable food should be made available to ALL American’s, because all American’s benefit from a health society. Therefore we strive to:</p>
<p>- Offer Affordable food to all Americans by buying direct from Producers<br/>- To eliminate Food Deserts across the USA by providing direct access to affordable good healthy food online, and through our warehouse through direct delivery and pick up<br/>- Reduce food waste by 75% over the next 3 years<br/>- Reduce the number of Americans that go to bed hungry from 1 in 7, to 1 in 3, in 3 years<br/>- To partner with Food Banks all across America to allow our excess food to be delivered to families in need all across our Country on a weekly basis<br/>- To save the lives of 3.5 Million Americans</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise <strong>at least $50,000</strong>. This is what we will be using with the money we raise:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>For pledging to help <strong>this is what you will get:</strong></p>
<p>- Discount/Credit to shop online, via app, or for those that live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, in person.<br/>- Discount/Credit on our Meal Prep Service<br/>- Discount/Credit  on our Bulk Food Service<br/>- A Good Food = Good Health Tee|<br/>- The Good Food Direct Grocery Tote<br/>- Be a guest cook in our online healthy cooking community<br/>- Chance to pick the next food desert we will try to eliminate</p>

<p><strong><u>The Impact:</u></strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Risks and Challenges</u></strong></p>
<p>Sadly, doing good can come with it's own challenges. Whether they be governmental, societal indifference and/or any host of things. The one thing we don't have is apathy. We are actively working to bring our hybrid vision of good affordable healthy food to ALL Americans. We see 3 challenges we are prepared to overcome.</p>
<p>1. Cost - We have been actively negotiating with over 100 direct producers of good food. These products range from fresh produce, to organic products, to ready made meals. We have already been given good pricing. However our pricing would be even less with volume. So we are constantly preparing for growth and hopes that our Indiegogo campaign will be that catalyst.</p>
<p>2. Technology - There are some technological hurdles we've been working on for the last 4 months. We have a good team, and will be looking to adding a couple more post Indiegogo. We are building a dynamic ecommerce site and companion app that is more intuitive than anything currently available. We hope to start testing our technology in December 2017.</p>
<p>3. Delivery - One of he biggest hurdles for most ecommerce companies is overcoming delivery and delivery cost. We will be overcoming this obstacle in 4 ways.<br/>a. Using our own reusable grocery totes for shipping and pickup where applicable through our tote exchange program<br/>b. Using our patent pending delivery platform that enables us to deliver more grocery boxes to more locations.<br/>c. Micro warehousing. Setting up small strategic warehouses in locations that utilize local food producers and communities.<br/>d. Limiting delivery days to 2 time per week.</p>
<p>This is why we can offer flat rate shipping</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong><u>Other ways you can help</u></strong></p>
<p>We understand that everyone may not want to buy groceries, tees and/or make a financial contribution. However, you can still do your part by getting the word. IN addition to telling your family, friends and co-workers, please post and share on your social media, our infographics, our videos, and most important, our Indiegogo link. :)</p>

<p>Hello people, this is our first experience in crowdfunding so do not judge us too strictly.</p>
<p><strong>Who we are?</strong></p>
<p>Let me introduce our team. My name is Patrice, my partner's name is Alexey and we are FunLogics. I used to be working as marketing manager in a number of companies and ended-up as a head of marketing department in a beer distribution company, Alexey runs an IT business since 2004, his team helps us with development.</p>
<p>Both of us spent a lot of time working on tasks of different customers, though most of them were completed successfully, we had feeling that we can start our own project, this is how BrewMapp was born!</p>
<p><strong>What we do?</strong></p>
<p>When I started working with beers, I fall in love with the drink… I wanted to know more about it and finally stumbled across name of Michael Jackson (he is also a king but in beer statistics). He was the first author to classify beer styles from different countries. In 70's his works were perfect source of knowledge for budding home-brewers on the verge of craft revolution as well as ordinary beer lovers from all over the world.</p>
<p>Michael’s work inspired me I wanted to spread the knowledge beyond beer professionals and brewers, down to the ground where bars and fun is. That is how <strong>BrewMapp</strong> was born, it helps people to navigate in a world of beers, bars and breweries and educate one selves as well as share their experience with others.</p>
<p><strong>What‘s new?</strong></p>
<p>We’re doing our best to think big! <strong>BrewMapp</strong> is quite a complex project, but we believe we have enough guts to succeed, here are few features we already have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Navigator©</strong> - helps to find a nearest pub with your favorite beer by the best price.</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Interactive©</strong> - allows you to comment and rate bars, beers and breweries as well as add new ones.</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Social©</strong> - chat with bros from both sides of the bar desk, post your experience, find out latest news.</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp BeerOpedia©</strong> - database of beers and breweries where you can learn more about your fav brews.</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMap Aggregator©</strong> - source of latest news and special offers from bars breweries and distributors.</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Recruting©</strong> - looking for a job in a bar, post a resume in your profile and apply, need an employee, post a vacancy. Discuss details online or arrange an off-line meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing special? May be, but It’s all in your pocket in one single app! Simply download it in AppStore and no, Android version is not available yet, actually this is one of the reasons we are here.</p>
<p>Few more things are coming soon with updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Check-in©</strong> - share your experience faster, post, rate, comment, receive awards!</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Rates©</strong> - most active users (these who would be hitting tops in check-ins, comments, adding beers and breweries, posting news with high amount of likes) shall be receiving special awards.</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Games©</strong> - fun beer games with real prizes, sponsored by bars breweries and other professional users.</li>
<li>
<strong>BrewMapp Global© - </strong>we’re working on addition of every bar in 46 most beer loving countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why we are here?</strong></p>
<p>We’re developing and perfect <strong>BrewMapp</strong> for more than two years and our resources start running low, so we decided to ask for your support people.</p>
<p>Our goal is 63 400 USD, it’s an equivalent of 4M rubles. That is two thirds of what we already invested in the project. We plan to spend this money three major purposes.</p>
<p>•             Development of android version, it’s almost there, but we need additional chips to polish it and set it sail.</p>
<p>•             Promotion, we do our best to make beer lovers hear our voice through various methods from personal recommendations at beer fests and meetings with bar owners to SMM and BTL campaigns but profound digital campaigns are quite pricey.</p>
<p>•             Updating and management of our database of beers and bars. BrewMapp concept is quite simple, we provide a platform and users upload data, but management and moderation of a global database takes resources.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards</strong></p>
<p>We would conduct a couple of private online tastings of interesting beers together with @PUBSMOSCOW one of the most thorough pub, beer and liquor expert blogs. Get your link for donation over 10$</p>
<p>Together with our friends from Tweed &amp; Stout® we prepared stylish t-shirts for these who would contribute over 50$, as well as link to online tasting broadcast.</p>
<p>These who would contribute over 100$ shall receive a personal gratitude post in BrewMapp as well as in all our social accounts and of course all listed above perks!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, any donation would be a great help for us, thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p><strong>It’s all about the money?</strong></p>
<p>Though <strong>BrewMapp</strong> was born in Russia, but doubtlessly it’s a global project! If you are in Memphis, Malaga, Perth, Nimes, Bruges, Moscow or Reykjavik simply add a bar you love or brews brewed by your neighboring brewery as well as some info about the brewery itself, make a couple of check ins and share a BrewMapp link in your social accounts, this would be a great contribution also!</p>
<p>We are looking for partners globally, so if you know how to support the project, please feel free to contact us.</p>
<p>Let’s share the diversity of beers together!</p>

That is how BrewMapp was born, it helps people to navigate in a world of beers, bars and breweries and educate one selves as well as share their experience with others.
What‘s new?
We’re doing our best to think big! BrewMapp is quite a complex project, but we believe we have enough guts to succeed, here are few features we already have:


BrewMapp Navigator© - helps to find a nearest pub with your favorite beer by the best price.

BrewMapp Interactive© - allows you to comment and rate bars, beers and breweries as well as add new ones.

BrewMapp Social© - chat with bros from both sides of the bar desk, post your experience, find out latest news.

BrewMapp BeerOpedia© - database of beers and breweries where you can learn more about your fav brews.

BrewMap Aggregator© - source of latest news and special offers from bars breweries and distributors.

BrewMapp Recruting© - looking for a job in a bar, post a resume in your profile and apply, need an employee, post a vacancy. Discuss details online or arrange an off-line meeting.

Nothing special? May be, but It’s all in your pocket in one single app! Simply download it in AppStore and no, Android version is not available yet, actually this is one of the reasons we are here.
Few more things are coming soon with updates:


BrewMapp Check-in© - share your experience faster, post, rate, comment, receive awards!

BrewMapp Rates© - most active users (these who would be hitting tops in check-ins, comments, adding beers and breweries, posting news with high amount of likes) shall be receiving special awards.

BrewMapp Games© - fun beer games with real prizes, sponsored by bars breweries and other professional users.

BrewMapp Global© - we’re working on addition of every bar in 46 most beer loving countries.

Why we are here?
We’re developing and perfect BrewMapp for more than two years and our resources start running low, so we decided to ask for your support people.
Our goal is 63 400 USD, it’s an equivalent of 4M rubles. That is two thirds of what we already invested in the project. We plan to spend this money three major purposes.
•             Development of android version, it’s almost there, but we need additional chips to polish it and set it sail.
•             Promotion, we do our best to make beer lovers hear our voice through various methods from personal recommendations at beer fests and meetings with bar owners to SMM and BTL campaigns but profound digital campaigns are quite pricey.
•             Updating and management of our database of beers and bars. BrewMapp concept is quite simple, we provide a platform and users upload data, but management and moderation of a global database takes resources.
Rewards
We would conduct a couple of private online tastings of interesting beers together with @PUBSMOSCOW one of the most thorough pub, beer and liquor expert blogs. Get your link for donation over 10$
Together with our friends from Tweed & Stout® we prepared stylish t-shirts for these who would contribute over 50$, as well as link to online tasting broadcast.
These who would contribute over 100$ shall receive a personal gratitude post in BrewMapp as well as in all our social accounts and of course all listed above perks!
Nevertheless, any donation would be a great help for us, thank you very much in advance.
It’s all about the money?
Though BrewMapp was born in Russia, but doubtlessly it’s a global project! If you are in Memphis, Malaga, Perth, Nimes, Bruges, Moscow or Reykjavik simply add a bar you love or brews brewed by your neighboring brewery as well as some info about the brewery itself, make a couple of check ins and share a BrewMapp link in your social accounts, this would be a great contribution also!
We are looking for partners globally, so if you know how to support the project, please feel free to contact us.
Let’s share the diversity of beers together!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jeff Stadler and I am the Owner of The DraftBox. I am a 100% Volunteer Firefighter and own a small service company. I was in the bar business (beer and wine) in the late 90's and was successful during my time in it.</p>
<p> The DraftBox is a mobile tap room made from a shipping container. The DraftBox is a fun, new, and exciting concept of turning a shipping container into a bar that can be taken to any event where alcohol can be sold, served, and consumed, e.g., Fairs, festivals, City/County events, private, corporate, etc. It can also be used as a beach bar!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are creating a brand that is The DraftBox. We need your help to get this to the next level. Although the cost is relatively low compared to a ""brick and mortar"" bar build it is still costly especially in the early stages. Some of the costs associated with this are shipping container purchases, modifications, roll-off truck for pick up and delivery of containers, marketing, custom paint work, uniforms, insurance, website development, etc. If our goal is not reached we will take all of the funds and continue to build the business by purchasing additional containers and modifying them in addition to some marketing. </p>
<p>As a ""Thank You"" for your support and contribution we have some really cool gifts which include a ""HOGG"" 20 oz stainless steel beer mug with our custom-designed logo on it and a T-shirt with our custom-designed logo on the front and ""I'd tap that"" or ""My Hoppy Place"" on the back!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The DraftBox is completely mobile and provides 8 beers on tap at a temperature between 36-38 degrees! It also features a walk-in cooler that will store up to 26 kegs of beer allowing us to serve thousands of ice-cold beers from one of our five serving windows. It can also be operated on or off grid. We will also be working with local craft breweries to feature their products and offer a ""Beer of the Month"" on tap. This helps support our community and local businesses. We are local but want to expand in our region and to other states and bring a DraftBox to your area and events! Please help us build our brand and make this the next big thing!</p>

<h3>Our Story:</h3>
<p>Monica and I have been presented with an opportunity to purchase American City Diner in Chevy Chase, DC.</p>
<p>Our campaign would help us preserve a piece of neighborhood history and build American City Diner back into what was once a popular family gathering spot. </p>
<p>The diner has been on the decline over the years and will soon be on it's way out if we don't step up and take the wheel. Replacing this landmark with another bank or business would be a blow to the spirit of our neighborhood.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story:
Monica and I have been presented with an opportunity to purchase American City Diner in Chevy Chase, DC.
Our campaign would help us preserve a piece of neighborhood history and build American City Diner back into what was once a popular family gathering spot. 
The diner has been on the decline over the years and will soon be on it's way out if we don't step up and take the wheel. Replacing this landmark with another bank or business would be a blow to the spirit of our neighborhood.
With over 10 years of experience operating a high volume restaurant, we're the team for the job! 

Our Ask:
What we're asking and what we'll deliver.

We need $100,000.00 to purchase the business outright
Once we purchase the restaurant we will improve all areas from menu, operations and decor (without ripping away the original charm).

I am Dual-Ph.D. student at Liverpool John Moores University, UK and University of Malaya, Malaysia. I am pleased to introduce a robotic cooking system called Bionic Cuisinier. Cooking is a must do daily activity during my study in Liverpool. One of my favourite dishes is Bak Kut Teh which is a pork herbal soup, it is very famous delicacy in Malaysia and Singapore. One day during my cooking, i realise that the cooking process is repeatable. I started to study the feasibility of making such a cooking mechanism since then. From my research and experiment, i came out with the design of Bionic Cuisinier (BENC-115).</p><p>The Bionic Cuisinier consist of a robotic arm with stirrer, water dispenser, induction cooker, platform, ingredient containers and  cooking pot. Please check out our video on what is the functionality of this device.</p><p> </p><h3>BENC-115, how to use it ?</h3><p>We will provide you the menu and instruction how to make your lovely food.  Firstly, you have to insert all the ingredients into the designated cups. For example garlic, meat, herb package, mushroom and seasoning. Select the menu and press start button, the machine will carry out the cooking sequence without human interference. It can cook many dishes including:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497161877/wvlqfueebjtmpmjcz1sa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>1.

However, as i am still a student, an amount of start up fund is needed for small scale production. These include renting a work space, set up a proper facility and employ engineers and researchers. With a proper work space and strong team, we will be able to produce this robotic cooking system with higher production standard, aesthetics and better services.</p><p> </p><h2>BENC-115</h2><p>To help my research, backers can pre-order the Bionic Cuisinier for self, family or business use. The BENC-115 is a solution for student accommodation, office's pantry, school, university and home cooking. It will be a major help and assurance to our product before it became a fully commercialised (It is currently patent pending). All the contributor's name will be remembered and put on the founder page.</p><h3> </h3><h3>EVERY LITTLE HELPS</h3><p>A huge thank you for your help, be a part of the thriving Bionic Cuisinier community!

I am Dual-Ph.D. student at Liverpool John Moores University, UK and University of Malaya, Malaysia. I am pleased to introduce a robotic cooking system called Bionic Cuisinier. Cooking is a must do daily activity during my study in Liverpool. One of my favourite dishes is Bak Kut Teh which is a pork herbal soup, it is very famous delicacy in Malaysia and Singapore. One day during my cooking, i realise that the cooking process is repeatable. I started to study the feasibility of making such a cooking mechanism since then. From my research and experiment, i came out with the design of Bionic Cuisinier (BENC-115).The Bionic Cuisinier consist of a robotic arm with stirrer, water dispenser, induction cooker, platform, ingredient containers and  cooking pot. Please check out our video on what is the functionality of this device. BENC-115, how to use it ?We will provide you the menu and instruction how to make your lovely food.  Firstly, you have to insert all the ingredients into the designated cups. For example garlic, meat, herb package, mushroom and seasoning. Select the menu and press start button, the machine will carry out the cooking sequence without human interference. It can cook many dishes including:1. Bak Kut Teh (Must eat food in Malaysia and Singapore)2. Korean Instant Noodle3. Tom Yum Soup4. Kimchi Soup5. Red Bean6. Green Bean7. Barley8. Curry Chicken9. Ginseng Chicken Soup10. Many Kind of Instant noodles and many more.This robotic cooking system is simple, easy to use, low cost, portable and most importantly it works! Why use BENC-115?This system will help to reduce cooking time and provide healthy food for working adults, students and families. There are two basic procedures to prepare a dish, prepare the ingredients and cooking process. This invention will replace half of the cooking workload by taking over the cooking process. Once all the ingredient is in place, this robotic cooking system will start the cooking sequence and you can walk away until the food is ready to serve.  What's more? It will definitely reduce the workload of our beloved mothers.As seen on:http://3dadept.com/meet-bionic-cuisinier-the-robotic-cooking-system-of-sean/ My GoalThis is a working prototype and ready for production. However, as i am still a student, an amount of start up fund is needed for small scale production. These include renting a work space, set up a proper facility and employ engineers and researchers. With a proper work space and strong team, we will be able to produce this robotic cooking system with higher production standard, aesthetics and better services. BENC-115To help my research, backers can pre-order the Bionic Cuisinier for self, family or business use. The BENC-115 is a solution for student accommodation, office's pantry, school, university and home cooking. It will be a major help and assurance to our product before it became a fully commercialised (It is currently patent pending). All the contributor's name will be remembered and put on the founder page. EVERY LITTLE HELPSA huge thank you for your help, be a part of the thriving Bionic Cuisinier community! All backers get a place on the Bionic Cuisinier community page, the warm feeling that comes from supporting cooking automation, and access to all discussions and project updates. FOUNDER + SURPRISE! Please join our Bionic Cuisinier Founders page for more updates and excitement.

<p>It was a hot summer evening and seven idle friends met to drink Gin Tonic. Of course such a chalice with a noble tonicum and much nobler gin should not be offered without decoration. Then one of the friends spoke with much ingenuity ""A cucumber"". Another ""A strip of it"". And many more ""Oh yeah!"" and ""Hooray!"".

<p>The one among them with the most excellent skills was chosen to make seven cucumber sticks. Alone, he did not succeed in creating great spears in a short time.

<p>They all sufficiently knew the cause, and their minds produced an idea that had never before befallen anyone. Thus, the first cucumber wave tool was materialized on a 3D printer and put to test the next evening. It succeeded very well!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>While working within the financial sector, I, Agata, was diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, having to change my diet and avoid various allergens. I started making my own version of healthy snacks for on-the-go. Astonished by the positive impact this diet change had on my gut and mental activity, I vowed to share my experience with millions of others struggling.</p>
<p>Within weeks together with my partner in crime, Sylvain, we started off making recipes at our home kitchen and the first superfood powered BITES were born. We toured every hippie-hippo district in London, sharing the snack BITES with everyone!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618478990/pvbx2kitwxewt5rvw0e2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After a successful launch, we set out on a new mission to develop an all-natural, plant protein and vitamin packed, fueled by adaptogen nutrition bars. Supported by the fantastic product development team, Kitchen Town, in Berlin, we commenced development and testing stages</p>
<p>It’s time we spread the word and have everyone FEELIN’ GOOD. We need your support to bring this vision to life.Help us reduce the stress levels and get these nutritionally complete AHARAbars out to the public. By backing us, you will help us get these bars into production, making AHARAbar a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>In a world that expects us to out-perform and have more focus, more drive, more calm, and be the BEST version of ourselves, we need to expect more from our snacks.</p>
<p>Our daily routines impact everything, and unhealthy snacks that are used as a quick fix, become a habit. Filled with high sugar and fat, these snacks spike our energy levels only temporarily. And while life does not get less busy, we still need snacks to keep us going.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618478332/pkdctdbmnunm4a8alfji.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Therefore, we created AHARAbar, your functional snack bar that helps your ambitious mind perform at its full potential.</p>
<h3>What is AHARAbar?</h3>
<p>AHARAbar is a plant-based nutritionally complete snack bar that has been designed helping you snack smarter, to think better. They are full of organic ingredients, which are gluten, nut, and soy free.  Formulated around key brain nutrients, packed with vitamins, plant protein and fueled by uplifting plants - <u>Adaptogens</u>.</p>

While working within the financial sector, I, Agata, was diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, having to change my diet and avoid various allergens. I started making my own version of healthy snacks for on-the-go. Astonished by the positive impact this diet change had on my gut and mental activity, I vowed to share my experience with millions of others struggling.
Within weeks together with my partner in crime, Sylvain, we started off making recipes at our home kitchen and the first superfood powered BITES were born. We toured every hippie-hippo district in London, sharing the snack BITES with everyone!

After a successful launch, we set out on a new mission to develop an all-natural, plant protein and vitamin packed, fueled by adaptogen nutrition bars. Supported by the fantastic product development team, Kitchen Town, in Berlin, we commenced development and testing stages
It’s time we spread the word and have everyone FEELIN’ GOOD. We need your support to bring this vision to life.Help us reduce the stress levels and get these nutritionally complete AHARAbars out to the public. By backing us, you will help us get these bars into production, making AHARAbar a reality!
 

The Problem
In a world that expects us to out-perform and have more focus, more drive, more calm, and be the BEST version of ourselves, we need to expect more from our snacks.
Our daily routines impact everything, and unhealthy snacks that are used as a quick fix, become a habit. Filled with high sugar and fat, these snacks spike our energy levels only temporarily. And while life does not get less busy, we still need snacks to keep us going.

Therefore, we created AHARAbar, your functional snack bar that helps your ambitious mind perform at its full potential.
What is AHARAbar?
AHARAbar is a plant-based nutritionally complete snack bar that has been designed helping you snack smarter, to think better. They are full of organic ingredients, which are gluten, nut, and soy free.  Formulated around key brain nutrients, packed with vitamins, plant protein and fueled by uplifting plants - Adaptogens.



All Natural - Made with organic ingredients that you can pronounce and understand.

Plant Protein - Packed with hemp protein, which is a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids.

That is Brewdo. Anyone can use Brewdo to make as much excellent cold brew coffee as one wants. Because I love coffee very much, I tried to come up with different ways to brew cold brew coffee before the cold brew took off. </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J9tA773OxrtfUwE/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:620px;""/></h3><p>When cold brew became really popular in Korea and all the major coffee franchises adopted the cold brew coffee, I tried it at many different coffee shops. Some cold brew from few franchises had great taste. But most of them were really bad. Thus, it fueled my passion to make the cold brew myself with all the knowledge about cold brew I accumulated.</p><p>Korea has its unique culture of being affectionate with people.</p><p>I wanted to serve many people with this amazing taste of cold brew coffee, and I thought that it would be convenient for me to make it at home instead of constantly buying it.</p><p>Through the years of experience, I discovered that using the tool when the brewing has stopped produces better and deeper flavor than using the tool while brewing. As a result, I conceived the idea of Brewdo not as an ordinary brewer but rather something to use after brewing is done.  </p><p>After undergoing several trials and errors, I came to a solidified idea of brewing and the shapes of the brewing stopper. I showed my plans and ideas to our team members, and they gave very positive feedback. That is how Brewdo began, and it enhanced technically and aesthetically as we added more improvements and sharpened ideas.</p><p>I encountered many cold brewing tools, and there are two main brewing methodologies for cold brew in the market: slow-drip (Kyoto-style or traditional Dutch style) and American Dutch style.</p><p>Slow-Drip methodology is probably the most common methodology one can find in the market. As most traditional cold brew coffee is produced through this method, the slow dripper metes out water so that for every drop that falls onto the saturated grounds, a drop of coffee spirals down the hand-blown glass tubes into the waiting carafe. Although the process takes hours to produce coffee, the machine and the process is indeed eye-grabbing. American Dutch methodology is simpler than the traditional Dutch method in the sense that the American-Dutch brewer is much smaller and easier to use. However, you do still need to purchase a specially-designed American Dutch brewer set. That is the biggest disadvantage of the American Dutch making. It is comparably still expensive, and since there is only one set users have to wait until finished using that one and therefore cannot mass-produce cold brew. This is where the efficiency and the differentiation of Brewdo come in. Whereas users have to purchase a special set piece of American Dutch brewer, you only need to buy a small yet effective Brewdo filter and attach it to the plastic bottle opening. The more plastic bottles you have, the more you can produce as much cold brew as you would like.</p><p>All you have to do is put the coffee ground into the plastic bottles and mix with water and let them sit in the refrigerator for hours. Then, take them out and attach the Brewdo filter and enjoy the coffee! There is no other technology like Brewdo that are out in the market. It is indeed innovative and cost-effecitve!</p><p> </p><p>In the end, all the tools that are in the market are the ones to use while brewing.</p><p>Brewdo is the only brewing product in the world for using it when the brewing has stopped.</p><p>Technically it can be classified as under American Dutch methodology, but the operating methods are the obverse of the American Dutch making.  </p><p>American Dutch brewing methodology has become more simpler and suitable for use compared to the traditional Dutch method. Yet, the critical disadvantage of American Dutch style is that you can only use one dripper.</p><p> Because of this, users have to wait a long time to before brewing again.  However, Brewdo uses regular plastic bottles that can be found everywhere. Therefore, anybody can easily mass-produce cold brew coffee. Moreover, because users only use Brewdo the moment brewing has stopped and filter out the coffee grounds after brewing is over, they can conveniently enjoy great taste of cold brew at their leisure.</p><p>Users can simply think that they can use just any plastic bottle and use regular paper filters to brew cold brew coffee. Yet, what differentiates Brewdo from the rest lies in its filtering technology.</p><p>After going through various different experiments trying different brewing styles such as using needle extract set, hybrid-form paper cup filter, and American Dutch style filtering, we have learned two groundbreaking facts: coffee tastes better through using traditional Dutch brewing method and the taste depends heavily on which filter users pour out through after coffee has been brewed.</p><p>To actualize our conceptions, we have gone through multiple different trials and experimentations.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCXcECo9RH7epKo/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:620px;""/></p><p>After many trials and errors, finally came the masterpiece. Brewdo</p><p>Brewdo uses a filtering technology when brewing is done. Although users may think that Brewdo’s filter size looks small, the coffee grounds that sink to the bottom due to gravity stays in the bottom even after pouring out the coffee. (If you want to filter out the entire coffee grounds in the bottle, you may need a gigantic size coffee filter.) Because not every coffee ground is the subject of filtering, Brewdo filters are therefore very efficient because of its small size yet great filtering. Furthermore, Brewdo filters are unlike any other paper filters that users will feel the telling difference between the coffees poured through Brewdo filters versus other regular paper filters.</p><p>People who are not regular coffee drinkers would clearly tell the difference. Directions on how to use are also very simple. In the plastic bottle, pour coffee and water and brew. Afterwards, simply pour through Brewdo filters. You can at anywhere and anytime enjoy fresh cold brew coffee with your family and friends.</p><p>By the time we were almost done with finalizing our plan, we wanted to share all the recipes, types of coffee beans that perfectly suit for Brewdo and of roasting, and various conditions of brewing (brewing in the room temperature, brewing in the refrigerator, etc) with Brewdo users. As a result, we decided to publish an app to conveniently share all of our knowledge.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/l378pSJ47Iwjxs4O4/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:620px;""/></p><p>Brewdo app provides the perfect type of cold brew recipe and informs the right ingredient requirements necessary to make cold brew coffee for the “x” number of people users want to serve. It has convenient formats that anyone regardless of coffee knowledge can use.</p><p>When you open the app, you will make certain selections and the app will provide you with the recipe and the timer. You don’t need to really worry about anything when it comes to making good cold brew. If you have a large refrigerator, you could possibly serve even 1000 people using our proprietary Brewdo technology.</p><p> </p><h3><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500630176/kunwehpbrn8el4xxr5cj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500561997/du9adnoiemtltayzxiof.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><p><i>The New Innovative Way of Making Cold Brew </i></p><p>If you are the coffee shop owner, you would want to adopt our methodology.</p><p>It only takes a couple tries for you to thoroughly understand how to use it.

Enjoy the coffee at your leisure.
Tip.If you have selected coarse-ground or medium-ground for the grinding option on the grinder but because your grinder wasn’t a high-performing one and as a result a recognizable portion of beans came out to be fine-ground, using the Brewdo filter more carefully would suffice.

  The simplest and the most innovative cold brew coffee filter. That is Brewdo. Anyone can use Brewdo to make as much excellent cold brew coffee as one wants. Because I love coffee very much, I tried to come up with different ways to brew cold brew coffee before the cold brew took off. When cold brew became really popular in Korea and all the major coffee franchises adopted the cold brew coffee, I tried it at many different coffee shops. Some cold brew from few franchises had great taste. But most of them were really bad. Thus, it fueled my passion to make the cold brew myself with all the knowledge about cold brew I accumulated.Korea has its unique culture of being affectionate with people.I wanted to serve many people with this amazing taste of cold brew coffee, and I thought that it would be convenient for me to make it at home instead of constantly buying it.Through the years of experience, I discovered that using the tool when the brewing has stopped produces better and deeper flavor than using the tool while brewing. As a result, I conceived the idea of Brewdo not as an ordinary brewer but rather something to use after brewing is done.  After undergoing several trials and errors, I came to a solidified idea of brewing and the shapes of the brewing stopper. I showed my plans and ideas to our team members, and they gave very positive feedback. That is how Brewdo began, and it enhanced technically and aesthetically as we added more improvements and sharpened ideas.I encountered many cold brewing tools, and there are two main brewing methodologies for cold brew in the market: slow-drip (Kyoto-style or traditional Dutch style) and American Dutch style.Slow-Drip methodology is probably the most common methodology one can find in the market. As most traditional cold brew coffee is produced through this method, the slow dripper metes out water so that for every drop that falls onto the saturated grounds, a drop of coffee spirals down the hand-blown glass tubes into the waiting carafe. Although the process takes hours to produce coffee, the machine and the process is indeed eye-grabbing. American Dutch methodology is simpler than the traditional Dutch method in the sense that the American-Dutch brewer is much smaller and easier to use. However, you do still need to purchase a specially-designed American Dutch brewer set. That is the biggest disadvantage of the American Dutch making. It is comparably still expensive, and since there is only one set users have to wait until finished using that one and therefore cannot mass-produce cold brew. This is where the efficiency and the differentiation of Brewdo come in. Whereas users have to purchase a special set piece of American Dutch brewer, you only need to buy a small yet effective Brewdo filter and attach it to the plastic bottle opening. The more plastic bottles you have, the more you can produce as much cold brew as you would like.All you have to do is put the coffee ground into the plastic bottles and mix with water and let them sit in the refrigerator for hours. Then, take them out and attach the Brewdo filter and enjoy the coffee! There is no other technology like Brewdo that are out in the market. It is indeed innovative and cost-effecitve! In the end, all the tools that are in the market are the ones to use while brewing.Brewdo is the only brewing product in the world for using it when the brewing has stopped.Technically it can be classified as under American Dutch methodology, but the operating methods are the obverse of the American Dutch making.  American Dutch brewing methodology has become more simpler and suitable for use compared to the traditional Dutch method. Yet, the critical disadvantage of American Dutch style is that you can only use one dripper. Because of this, users have to wait a long time to before brewing again.  However, Brewdo uses regular plastic bottles that can be found everywhere. Therefore, anybody can easily mass-produce cold brew coffee. Moreover, because users only use Brewdo the moment brewing has stopped and filter out the coffee grounds after brewing is over, they can conveniently enjoy great taste of cold brew at their leisure.Users can simply think that they can use just any plastic bottle and use regular paper filters to brew cold brew coffee. Yet, what differentiates Brewdo from the rest lies in its filtering technology.After going through various different experiments trying different brewing styles such as using needle extract set, hybrid-form paper cup filter, and American Dutch style filtering, we have learned two groundbreaking facts: coffee tastes better through using traditional Dutch brewing method and the taste depends heavily on which filter users pour out through after coffee has been brewed.To actualize our conceptions, we have gone through multiple different trials and experimentations.After many trials and errors, finally came the masterpiece. BrewdoBrewdo uses a filtering technology when brewing is done. Although users may think that Brewdo’s filter size looks small, the coffee grounds that sink to the bottom due to gravity stays in the bottom even after pouring out the coffee. (If you want to filter out the entire coffee grounds in the bottle, you may need a gigantic size coffee filter.) Because not every coffee ground is the subject of filtering, Brewdo filters are therefore very efficient because of its small size yet great filtering. Furthermore, Brewdo filters are unlike any other paper filters that users will feel the telling difference between the coffees poured through Brewdo filters versus other regular paper filters.People who are not regular coffee drinkers would clearly tell the difference. Directions on how to use are also very simple. In the plastic bottle, pour coffee and water and brew. Afterwards, simply pour through Brewdo filters. You can at anywhere and anytime enjoy fresh cold brew coffee with your family and friends.By the time we were almost done with finalizing our plan, we wanted to share all the recipes, types of coffee beans that perfectly suit for Brewdo and of roasting, and various conditions of brewing (brewing in the room temperature, brewing in the refrigerator, etc) with Brewdo users. As a result, we decided to publish an app to conveniently share all of our knowledge.Brewdo app provides the perfect type of cold brew recipe and informs the right ingredient requirements necessary to make cold brew coffee for the “x” number of people users want to serve. It has convenient formats that anyone regardless of coffee knowledge can use.When you open the app, you will make certain selections and the app will provide you with the recipe and the timer. You don’t need to really worry about anything when it comes to making good cold brew. If you have a large refrigerator, you could possibly serve even 1000 people using our proprietary Brewdo technology. The New Innovative Way of Making Cold Brew If you are the coffee shop owner, you would want to adopt our methodology.It only takes a couple tries for you to thoroughly understand how to use it. Once you grasp it, you can make the best use of it and provide the telling enjoyable experience to your customers. You will recognize the unfathomable potential this little device can have once you begin to use it. It is the best commercial cold brew maker (commercial brewery machine). 1.How does Brewdo provide a deeper and more elegant taste of cold brew coffee than the traditional coffee brewed through Dutch method? 
Using the American Dutch brewing methodology contributes a lot in enhancing the taste of the coffee. Plus, the one of a kind filtering technology that Brewdo filters provide is indeed a game changer that it will exude and preserve the delicate scent and the taste. (shaking the bottle during brewing will make the taste more profound) 
With Brewdo technology, users can more easily control the coffee taste and scent. 
There are factors such as organic acid, fatty acid, tannin that determine the taste. With Brewdo technology, users can control these factors easier through brewing. 
The more you use it, the better you become at using Brewdo to make better tastes of cold brew. 
2.Don’t know much about the recipe? 
You don’t really need to know the recipe because the Brewdo app is always there on hand. 
The Brewdo app contains all the know-hows especially on various cold brew flavors that our team has accumulated over the years. 
App provides a variety of different brewing recipe for cold brew. Each recipe has its own unique taste that will capture your minds. 
“It’s not because you fall in love, your heart beats faster. You fall in love because your heart beats faster. Therefore, it is crucial that you make your loved one’s heart beats faster through providing the amazing coffee taste and aroma scent.” – Brewdo APP (Available on IOS, Android) 
Principle of the recipe is science-based. However, you can put aside the science behind recipe for the time being and just enjoy the mesmerizing taste of our Brewdo coffee.  
If you aren’t sure about funding for Brewdo, try first using the Brewdo app. You will discover so much about the different cold brew tastes and scents that you didn’t even realize exist. If you open the app, you will immediately realize our firm passion on our Brewdo cold brew.                   
Brewdo Cold Brew filter is incredibly easy to use. Follow the instruction below.

<h3>DiversiTea: Data-Driven Tea Recommendations Just For You</h3>
<p>DiversiTea is a Sheffield based business that was established in 2017 by Ted Kim and James Home. We started as a premium curated tea subscription service. DiversiTea sourced and packages fresh loose leaf teas every month with each box themed. For example, in May 2018, we themed our box ""May the fourth be with you"" inspired by the characters in the famous movie. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541780317/i3tc2bu7ml1wiwm5yzdy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(DiversiTea at Sheffield Food Festival 2018)</i></p>
<p>After 1+ year of running the business, many customer feedback from our previous sales indicated the wide demand for the personalisation service. Some wanted non-caffeinated tea with grassy and nutty flavour, and some wanted a tea that is great to brew in cold water with a fruity flavour. This led DiversiTea on a mission to transform customers' tea experience by devising a data-driven tea recommendation system. Truly, DiversiTea is for someone with particular taste.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(We went to different market stalls to get feedbacks!)</i></p>
<p>Currently, we have been developing for our recommendation system for months. We have participated in Sheffield Innovation Programme in order to define the basic tea ontology, which is supported by the Sheffield City Region Growth Hub, European Regional Development Fund and Sheffield Hallam University. This has been built through and we want to exclusively test it with the backers in Indiegogo!</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 2;""><strong>Mushroom Unlock History's Secrets°</strong> – In cultures around the world, ancient healing traditions relied on the unique properties of mushrooms – a.k.a fungi – to support health and human performance. We've selected two of our favorites for Coffee+: Chaga &amp; Cordyceps. <u>Chaga is an antioxidant powerhouse that is used in Russian and Norwegian folk medicine for immune support.</u>°° Cordyceps is native to the high-altitudes of the Himalayas and is an all-star of traditional Chinese medicine for more than a 1,000 years.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Let's all help each other like we're ol' friends</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 2;"">We simply need to presell enough Coffee+ to place our first order. Then, 90 days later, we can start shipping our Coffee+ for all of us to enjoy and feel better every day. Everyone, so far, loves Coffee+, but since I can't send a bajillion samples to every person, I want to make this as low risk as possible for you. I'm starting the prices for Coffee+ ridiculously low. It's more important for me to get this to you than it is to make money.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 2;"">If you're personally not interested in Coffee+, I get it. No sweat, but we could still use your help :). I'm doing this campaign on a shoe-string budget, so if you could just tell a friend (or 2...or 3... or a baker's dozen) whom might be interested in Coffee plus, I would super-duper appreciate it and love you forever.</span></p>

Everyone, so far, loves Coffee+, but since I can't send a bajillion samples to every person, I want to make this as low risk as possible for you. I'm starting the prices for Coffee+ ridiculously low. It's more important for me to get this to you than it is to make money.
If you're personally not interested in Coffee+, I get it. No sweat, but we could still use your help :). I'm doing this campaign on a shoe-string budget, so if you could just tell a friend (or 2...or 3... or a baker's dozen) whom might be interested in Coffee plus, I would super-duper appreciate it and love you forever.
Cheers!
- J. Root
 
Thank you so much for your time, consideration and support! I'm excited to share Coffee+ with you.

I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you the gist of our campaign before we get into the nitty gritty. We are a small, high-end food company that does not compromise our all-natural and fresh approach to food products. Because of this, we need backers like you to help us expand our production line so that we can start to compete with the big companies that do things cheap and fast. Check out our story, what we’ll do with the funding and of course our awesome perks.

<h3><strong>HOW DOES THIS WORK </strong></h3>
<div>
<p>LuBox is easy to operate: simply fill with yummy dish and connect it to a power supply like wall  adapter, Laptop USB. Within 5-10 minutes the LuBox will reach to desire temperature that you have set.</p>
<p>Inbuild LED light indicator allows you know that your meal is ready to eat. It changes colour as the change of temperature inside. </p>
<p>We have developed a special system that helps to prevent leakage even during transportation or tilting. The heat then spreads evenly on the surface of the tray. When Lubox will get over heated then extra heat exhaust from the tiny holes build in fan back side of box, and maintained the temperature.</p>
<p>Lubox is connect with your mobile via bluetooth. You can control from remote place also. </p>
</div>
</div><h3><strong>HEATING MECHANISM </strong></h3><div>The Lubox's heating technology is elegantly built-in between the inner and outer walls of the container. Its interface is made up of clever, press and subtle light indicators to let you know when your food is just right. It is wirelessly powered by setting it onto it's compact, USB-powered side panel, so you can use it anywhere. To save valuable space for food and extend it’s lifespan, the *LuBox has chargeable battery build inside. </div><div><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p></div><p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Lubox photo ezgif.com-crop.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1238.photobucket.com/albums/ff482/sunderrana3/ezgif.com-crop.gif"" src=""""/></a></p><div>Once you've selected your perfect temperature, and watch it light up. </div><div>
<p>If your food is hotter than the temperature you chose, it will glow <strong>RED</strong>. </p>

Our company Harvest Heat is in its infancy stages, we've produced our first test production batch with a licensed co-packer and it is being presented to the FDA &amp; FDB for batch recipe testing and approval. This includes label design approval, batch process approval, shelf-life sustainability and longevity testing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are two of the hardest working gals that you will meet! Chances are that many of you have seen us out an about shaking up or signature Detroit themed lemonades or frying up some mini donut deliciousness all around the metro Detroit area.  We started making donuts 7 years ago and have been able to grow organically and steadily since then. We are extremely excited to have the opportunity to open a brick and mortar concept of our mobile business in the heart of downtown Detroit.</p>
<p>We need to renovate our space, get licensed, and hire/train quality people to help us take this to the next level.  </p>
<p>Who's in????!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise 125,000.</p>
<p>The funds will be used help with licensing, renovations/decor of our space, upgrading damaged equipment, adding new equipment, and to hire and train awesome full time staff to help us out.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we can scale back some projects or put them off until we open and sales can dictate further purchases. It would however, be amazing to get everything done before we open our doors. </p>
<p>We are not quitters and will work with whatever we have to make this dream happen just a we have for the past 7 years!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us to inspire other small grass roots businesses that success is possible. Being a minority and woman owned company, we want to motivate those starting their journey.  When started seven years ago, we had no formal ""funding"".  What we did have was a big idea, families to support, and a lot of hard work, dedication and sacrifice. We put in more sweat equity than anything and the payoff has been amazing!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jason Johnson is the innovator behind The H.U.B.B.  and has spent over 15 years in restaurant management with large successful brands. He believes in an environment of shared knowledge and resources to achieve a more successful bottom line for all. </p>
<p>J. Johnson &amp; Company L.L.C. dba The H.U.B.B. (Helping Underserved Beginning Businesses) will provide all the services needed to operate a successful food business in ONE location!

The H.U.B.B.’s non-profit partner “Collaborative Kitchens” works to solve the problems of equity in business ownership for low-income, minority, and women culinary entrepreneurs by providing an affordable solution to the space, time, and expense of owning or leasing a kitchen of their own full time. Our vision is an innovative, vibrant, and inclusive economic landscape. A collaboration of small business owners using their collective knowledge, talent, and resources to elevate the local culinary topography while increasing employment opportunities for the community and profits of the members.</p>

We anticipate that there will be a need for a second kitchen facility in a different area of North Carolina within 5 years of The H.U.B.B. opening.</p>

Jason Johnson is the innovator behind The H.U.B.B.  and has spent over 15 years in restaurant management with large successful brands. He believes in an environment of shared knowledge and resources to achieve a more successful bottom line for all.

A small business incubator, food truck commissary, and commercial kitchen facilities for rent by the hour, week, or month to the culinary entrepreneur community – serving restaurant owners, private chefs, food truck vendors, beginning farmers, home-based bakers and producers, private instructors or demonstrators, and individuals who are seeking culinary arts classes and workshops. The H.U.B.B.’s non-profit partner “Collaborative Kitchens” works to solve the problems of equity in business ownership for low-income, minority, and women culinary entrepreneurs by providing an affordable solution to the space, time, and expense of owning or leasing a kitchen of their own full time. Our vision is an innovative, vibrant, and inclusive economic landscape. A collaboration of small business owners using their collective knowledge, talent, and resources to elevate the local culinary topography while increasing employment opportunities for the community and profits of the members.

Purchase Real Estate 
Renovate and Expand facilities
$240,000 Private Investors

$10,000 - Schematic Design/Site Plan 
If we do not reach our target goal the funds will be donated to charity helping underprivileged new culinary entrepreneurs rent commercial space in other facilities until we open for operations.

The Impact
THE MISSION
 Cultivate culinary entrepreneurs as they formalize and grow their businesses by providing professionally managed, easily accessible, and affordable commercial kitchen space, industry-specific technical assistance and access to market opportunities.
THE VISION
A collaboration of small business owners using their collective knowledge, talent, and resources to elevate the local culinary landscape while increasing profits of the members.
THE GOAL 
Become a thriving community shared-use kitchen that will support a major increase in the number of local food products and local culinary businesses in Durham County and beyond. After five years of operation our goal is to have launched a variety of new culinary businesses and products into the greater Raleigh-Durham area, and see a concomitant increase in culinary-related employment and entrepreneur success. We anticipate that there will be a need for a second kitchen facility in a different area of North Carolina within 5 years of The H.U.B.B. opening.

<p>Friends! Russell Street Deli is not coming back but we do have some GOOD NEWS. Russell St. was the caterpillar, and we are about to start that butterfly phase! We’re going to open a new place. Yay! We need $175,000. Whoa!  We can’t do it without you. Gulp!</p>
<p>We’ve looked at hundreds of spaces. White box spaces, new builds, places that would cost 500K to build out, places that cost 800K to buy, new developments desperate for anchor businesses, and places that have absolutely nothing to do with the neighborhood they’re in, (yikes!). Frankly, it was disheartening. </p>
<p>Then, of course, the pandemic. Staff and owners, deep friends all over the country lost their restaurants, their savings, their jobs, and their livelihoods. Russell St. would have not survived. We were already squeaking by, and frankly we don’t know how people who are still open are pulling it off. But they are keeping people in jobs and that is paramount.</p> <p>During COVID, we have had many offers as restaurants shutter. Landlords need new owners to hermit crab into places that just experienced incredible downfalls. That doesn’t feel like a good fit. In all these visits to potential locations it became clear, we wanted a place we were saving. New real estate developments are fine, but we wanted something that felt like the times in Detroit that have been so readily erased by development and now the pandemic. We wanted to find a spot that felt like it was going to VIBE FOR YEARS. We expected to be in the deli for years, which we had been, feeding people, watching people fall in love, build families, grow, fall on hard times occassionally--but always have a place to come have soup and a cup of coffee where it’s not like $17.50 before tip.</p> <p>Our new spot, fingers crossed, is Baker Streetcar in Hamtramck. It’s going to be a lift, though. And so we need your help. The joint needs some updates and some big capital moves (an exhaust hood, (where we cook), a walk-in cooler, (a giant refrigerator)). In the end, what we hope we’ll have is a place that is integral to its community and produces incredible food.</p> <p>FYI, it’s going to be a dinner place. Pizza and pasta (handmade daily), primarily because we can make it from scratch. As chefs, this menu gives us a lot more wiggle room economically. If you think about it, a pizza ain’t nothing but a big ol’ open-faced sandwich anyway and sauces are just soup. It’s a thing we love, the possibility of combinations, the way people of all ages love pizza. We DO PLAN to serve brunch one Sunday a month because we know that's who we were to you for so many years and obviously our brunch game is out of sight.</p> <p>175K is a HUGE ask, but you don’t have to do it all yourself. If 1,750 people toss in $100 bucks we’re there! Community lift! Whatever you can give works, but as important, please SHARE THIS. The share is just as important as the give, really. We need to make sure that everybody who loves all the types of Detroit that Russell St. represented knows that this is happening. Even if that person couldn’t make it to us too often, there’s going to be a new place for them. Do us a favor and reach out to them? </p> <p>We will put in a ton of cash ourselves but we think 175 is the right figure to get us up and running safely and for the long term. If we don’t make it within a stone's throw of our goal, all the money goes back to donors and no new restaurant. In a way it’s a barn raising, and we all have to do it together. Good jobs and amazing food! Love y’all!</p>

<h2>proud.pizza: You eat - We feed!</h2>
<p>My name is Nicolas Schill (left) and I have a dream. In my dream I see a world in which starvation and social injustice have no place. At the moment every 10 seconds, a child dies because of starvation. Our goal is to end hunger by saving every 10 seconds one child! I believe charity should not cost anything. Thats why I started proud.pizza. Together with my teammate David (right), we want to create a new consumer trend.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>proud.pizza is a food delivery app, which converts people's daily food consumption into donations. With every order you make on proud.pizza you save one child from starvation. proud.pizza shares a quarter of the commission income in order to make this sustainable change in society possible. Since the donation is included in the order value, every person can save children with their everyday consumption without having to make financial efforts.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>The Power of One</h2>
<div>
<p>proud.pizza is more than just a company, it is a movement. A movement into the new age of sustainable economy. proud.pizza believes in the power of one. Each and every one of us can change the world with our daily decisions. The greatest power of humans is conscious consumption. With proud.pizza we want to give all people the power to save lives with their daily consumption without having to pay extra.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>I used to support large international aid organizations like many other people. After my research, I no longer trust any of them. Well, like many other people.                                                  That is why proud.pizza only works with small local assosiations which provide us photos and videos to watch what happens with the money. Due to the fact that we are proud of our work, you can watch our projects on social media. Follow us, watch the progress and share the mission with others!</p>

My name is Nicolas Schill (left) and I have a dream. In my dream I see a world in which starvation and social injustice have no place. At the moment every 10 seconds, a child dies because of starvation. Our goal is to end hunger by saving every 10 seconds one child! I believe charity should not cost anything. Thats why I started proud.pizza. Together with my teammate David (right), we want to create a new consumer trend.

 
proud.pizza explained in 1 minute

 
proud.pizza is a food delivery app, which converts people's daily food consumption into donations. With every order you make on proud.pizza you save one child from starvation. proud.pizza shares a quarter of the commission income in order to make this sustainable change in society possible. Since the donation is included in the order value, every person can save children with their everyday consumption without having to make financial efforts.
 
The Power of One

proud.pizza is more than just a company, it is a movement. A movement into the new age of sustainable economy. proud.pizza believes in the power of one. Each and every one of us can change the world with our daily decisions. The greatest power of humans is conscious consumption. With proud.pizza we want to give all people the power to save lives with their daily consumption without having to pay extra.

 
Transparency
I used to support large international aid organizations like many other people. After my research, I no longer trust any of them. Well, like many other people.                                                  That is why proud.pizza only works with small local assosiations which provide us photos and videos to watch what happens with the money. Due to the fact that we are proud of our work, you can watch our projects on social media. Follow us, watch the progress and share the mission with others!


proud.pizza´s mission is to create a sustainable consumption trend to end starvation.            Since proud.pizza stands for transparency, I would like to show you how we use our income:

A quarter will be donated                                                                                                                         
One third flows into our unique sales model to expand our network of partners
The rest keeps the company going.

Το μούσλι γύρης εμπλουτίζει τα σνακ και τα πρωινά σας με φυσικές γεύσεις κάνοντάς τα πιο πλήρη διατροφικά.</p><h3><strong>Γιατί γύρη μελισσών;</strong></h3><p>Η γύρη μελισσών είναι ένα έντονα θρεπτικό μελισσοκομικό προϊόν μιας και περιέχει σχεδόν όλα τα θρεπτικά συστατικά που χρειάζεται ο ανθρώπινος οργανισμός και για αυτό το λόγο θεωρείται υπερτροφή. Το πιο σημαντικό είναι η υψηλή περιεκτικότητά της σε καθαρή εύκολα αφομοιώσιμη πρωτεϊνη.</p><p>Παρακάτω είναι μόνο μερικά από τα οφέλη της κατανάλωσης γύρης:</p><ol>

         GRΔουλεύετε πολλές ώρες, ασκείστε, είστε αθλητής ή σουπερ-μαμά, προσπαθείτε να κάνετε ότι μπορείτε για να διατρέφεστε σωστά, αλλά η φύση έχει συστατικά, όπως η γύρη, τα οποία πιθανόν να αγνοείτε!Το μούσλι γύρης που παράγουμε στο Γαϊδαράκο, μετατρέπει το πρωινό σας σε μια… «βόμβα» υγείας και θρέψης! Το μούσλι γύρης εμπλουτίζει τα σνακ και τα πρωινά σας με φυσικές γεύσεις κάνοντάς τα πιο πλήρη διατροφικά.Γιατί γύρη μελισσών;Η γύρη μελισσών είναι ένα έντονα θρεπτικό μελισσοκομικό προϊόν μιας και περιέχει σχεδόν όλα τα θρεπτικά συστατικά που χρειάζεται ο ανθρώπινος οργανισμός και για αυτό το λόγο θεωρείται υπερτροφή. Το πιο σημαντικό είναι η υψηλή περιεκτικότητά της σε καθαρή εύκολα αφομοιώσιμη πρωτεϊνη.Παρακάτω είναι μόνο μερικά από τα οφέλη της κατανάλωσης γύρης:
Φυσική τόνωση & ενίσχυση της αντοχής

The drink of the Inca nobles and warriors was prepared with cacao especially grown for the nobility.We only use cacao of unique origin from Chazuta, a region on the edge of the Amazon within San Martin, Peru, an area which is famous for its high quality fine flavor cacao. Panela de La Abuela Orgánica (LAO)Panela, as some people know, is a very powerful sweetener that is obtained by evaporating the juices from sugar cane.Our Panela, from Piura, stands out for being a more natural product, without any refinement, which allows it to store an infinity of properties of great nutritional value. If you want to leave sugar, try panela, without a doubt, it is the best solution to maintain the sweetness of your food. Maras Salt de La Abuela Orgánica (LAO)Salinas de Maras is located along the slopes of Qaqawiñay Mountain, at an elevation of 3,380m in the Urumbamba Valley, 46km outside of Cusco, Peru. This Salt have healing & anti-inflammatory properties and is propitious to regulate the arterial pressure thanks to its low concentration of sodium chloride.Is beneficial for people with hypertension because they must minimize the consumption of common salt that has a high concentration of sodium chloride. Almonds covered with Bitter Chocolate de La Abuela Orgánica (LAO)It's not easy to turn off your chocolate cravings and give up sweets.By combining the real Peruvian bitter chocolate with national Almonds which are naturally loaded with vitamin E, we turned a tough challenge into a delicious snack you can enjoy every day. 100% Organic, this makes a great healthy lifestyle snack for chocolate lovers and Dried Fruits Lovers. Giant Corn de La Abuela Orgánica (LAO)The god Pachacámac, creator of all things on Earth, was represented inside his Inca temple with a cluster of giant Corn attached to his belt, as a symbol of prosperity, abundance and fortune.After several centuries, the Giant Corn from Cusco; a product with a designation of origin, continues to illuminate the destiny of its descendants.This Snack is a highly energetic food and rich in digestible nutrients. Cereals such as corn provide remarkable amounts of protein and other nutrients. Our Giant Corn is rich in phosphorus, potassium and magnesium, ideal for a salty pause during the day. COMMUNITY""The Future belongs to those who believe in the Beauty of their Dreams."" E.R ""Many people still confuse Organic Products with Light or Diet products.""However, they do not have a direct relationship. Organic foods are those that have grown free of pesticides, agro toxic substances, hormones and antibiotics.Following this principle, La Abuela Orgánica establishes a relationship of harmony with the environment, selecting with expertise the organic lands and organic collaborators who can, together, reach the 100% Organic products for a healthy lifestyle. ""Each Pleasure is paired with a Charity Foundation.""La Abuela Orgánica fights for many causes that are close to her heart and actively participates in the development of several charitable projects.

<p>For 20 years we have been living in Italy building intimate relationships with wine producers, restaurant owners, sommelier, and wine enthusiasts, hence our name ""INTIMO WINES.""</p>
<p>We are now returning home to the US to represent our meticulously chosen portfolio of producers and their finest wines and vintages.  </p>
<p>The wines we have carefully selected are as far as you can get from mass market.</p>
<p>Each producer we work with produces 10,000 bottles a year, or less, of each selected wine, giving every bottle the upmost importance and quality.</p>
<p>These are the wines that Italians love to drink, for this reason these particular wines rarely make their way to the US. </p>
<p>Our goal is to allow fellow wine lovers in the US to experience what it truly means to live and drink wine in Italy, without paying the typically high prices. As all wine lovers know, unfortunately imported wines are marked up considerably by the importer, then the distributor or wholesaler, and then again by the retailer. </p>
<p>To achieve our goal, we opened Intimo Wines LLC and created an ADHOC portfolio of premier wines and the best vintages of each.</p>
<p>We then successfully obtained our federal basic permit for importing wine into the US, fully registered each wine label with the TTB for (COLA) certification approval, and had each producer individually register with the FDA while nominating Intimo Wines LLC as their FDA broker and National Importer.</p>
<p>We have also recently partnered with an exclusive wine shop in New Hampshire who will be operating under the name ""Intimo Wines Wine Shop"" and who will offer only the wines imported and represented by Intimo Wines LLC. </p>
<p>Due to current alcohol and Direct To Client (DTC) shipping laws, Intimo Wines Wine Shop in New Hampshire will also focus on shipping wines to the 15 states where we are licensed to ship, allowing the public in more or less 1/3 of the country to place orders online rather than visiting the wine shop in New Hampshire. </p>
<p>We have chosen our logistics provider/freight forwarder, and we are now ready to import the first portfolio. A unique collection of 92 reds, 47 whites, 8 rosè, 6 spumante, and 7 prosecco, from North Italy, South Italy, and the islands, obviously completely certified DOC, DOCG, or IGT.</p>
<p>You can find the complete portfolio of Intimo Wines LLC  online with links to each producer at <a href=""http://www.intimowines.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.intimowines.com</a> </p>
<p>However we need some help to make this dream come true, and this is where you come in.</p>
<p>In order to cover the costs of licensing, logistics, taxes, and above all, the <strong>WINE</strong>, we are looking for funding (<strong>pre-orders</strong>) from individuals interested in obtaining wines from our portfolio at a discounted and otherwise impossible price. </p>
<p>So what we have decided to do is to offer you the possibility to join Intimo Wines, and to obtain the wines in our portfolio with little to no mark up at all, you will be basically buying directly from the wine producer in Italy with only the added cost of importation and shipping. </p>
<p>Intimo Wines LLC is not interested in producing profit at this stage in our development, our main goal is to introduce our portfolio to the US, and to establish relationships with fellow wine admirers such as yourselves. Specifically those who appreciate the time and work we put into selecting our ADHOC portfolio of high quality fine Italian wine, produced by passionate wine makers who are focused on the wine itself rather than the profits or sales. </p>
<p>Our goal is to receive the necessary funding with in the first weeks of August, we will then purchase the wines, one full container (roughly 6,000 bottles) which will then be shipped (40 days give or take) to the appropriate port of entry in Maine, and following customs clearance, the wines will be stored in our partners warehouse where each wine will be scanned, entered into our database, and prepared for delivery. </p>
<p>If all goes well, the wines should arrive to our backers doorsteps before the end of September or early October. </p>

We then successfully obtained our federal basic permit for importing wine into the US, fully registered each wine label with the TTB for (COLA) certification approval, and had each producer individually register with the FDA while nominating Intimo Wines LLC as their FDA broker and National Importer.
We have also recently partnered with an exclusive wine shop in New Hampshire who will be operating under the name ""Intimo Wines Wine Shop"" and who will offer only the wines imported and represented by Intimo Wines LLC. 
Due to current alcohol and Direct To Client (DTC) shipping laws, Intimo Wines Wine Shop in New Hampshire will also focus on shipping wines to the 15 states where we are licensed to ship, allowing the public in more or less 1/3 of the country to place orders online rather than visiting the wine shop in New Hampshire. 
We have chosen our logistics provider/freight forwarder, and we are now ready to import the first portfolio. A unique collection of 92 reds, 47 whites, 8 rosè, 6 spumante, and 7 prosecco, from North Italy, South Italy, and the islands, obviously completely certified DOC, DOCG, or IGT.
You can find the complete portfolio of Intimo Wines LLC  online with links to each producer at www.intimowines.com 
However we need some help to make this dream come true, and this is where you come in.
In order to cover the costs of licensing, logistics, taxes, and above all, the WINE, we are looking for funding (pre-orders) from individuals interested in obtaining wines from our portfolio at a discounted and otherwise impossible price. 
So what we have decided to do is to offer you the possibility to join Intimo Wines, and to obtain the wines in our portfolio with little to no mark up at all, you will be basically buying directly from the wine producer in Italy with only the added cost of importation and shipping. 
Intimo Wines LLC is not interested in producing profit at this stage in our development, our main goal is to introduce our portfolio to the US, and to establish relationships with fellow wine admirers such as yourselves. Specifically those who appreciate the time and work we put into selecting our ADHOC portfolio of high quality fine Italian wine, produced by passionate wine makers who are focused on the wine itself rather than the profits or sales. 
Our goal is to receive the necessary funding with in the first weeks of August, we will then purchase the wines, one full container (roughly 6,000 bottles) which will then be shipped (40 days give or take) to the appropriate port of entry in Maine, and following customs clearance, the wines will be stored in our partners warehouse where each wine will be scanned, entered into our database, and prepared for delivery. 
If all goes well, the wines should arrive to our backers doorsteps before the end of September or early October.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>With a small group of people, we’ve created for the first time an Animal Rights Subject in the Law School of the University of Cordoba. In 2012, it became the first American University to teach animal protection laws to future lawyers.</p>
<p>I knew that it was time to move forward and change the game from the inside out. It was the moment to be a conscious entrepreneur.</p>
<p>As it's been a long time since I have stopped drinking cow milk, I have decided to create a plant-based products line that would include drinks made from grains and nuts.</p>
<p>The idea was simple: offer a healthy and practical product that could be easily consumed by us, humans!</p>

DISCOVER MY STORY:
Have you ever imagine the work of your dream ? I did. Mine was creating something that would impact the world for the better and that would make a difference for Animals.  
Since I was a little girl I felt this wonderful connection with them : I adopted homeless dogs and cats, I chose products that were cruelty-free and I also changed my diet to a plant-based one.

I studied laws, reason why I’ve started to work as an Animal Rights’ Lawyer.  
I‘ve represented in the Court more that 70 causes of animal cruelty: dogs, cats, horses.  
I’ve lectured in several national and international Animal Rights Conferences.

With a small group of people, we’ve created for the first time an Animal Rights Subject in the Law School of the University of Cordoba. In 2012, it became the first American University to teach animal protection laws to future lawyers.
I knew that it was time to move forward and change the game from the inside out. It was the moment to be a conscious entrepreneur.
As it's been a long time since I have stopped drinking cow milk, I have decided to create a plant-based products line that would include drinks made from grains and nuts.
The idea was simple: offer a healthy and practical product that could be easily consumed by us, humans!
By 2016, I've started doing product tests and I've created Cerealthy®: http://cerealthy.com

<p><u><strong>Sooooo what's Yeet?</strong></u></p>
<p>By mixing CBD with our careful selection of Natural Plant Extracts and Vitamin Supplements, then blending them into our refreshing high in antioxidant Blueberry &amp; Cranberry Juice, we have managed to formulate what we think is the perfect post-night concoction.</p>
<p>Let's explain how it works. Meet all the components to the beverage below. Take a look at all the goodness that’s inside, and how they can make your Sundays feel sooo much better.</p>
<p><u><strong>Organic CBD Oil - Natural Pain &amp; Anxiety Relief </strong></u></p>
<p>The UK has finally been blessed with the legalisation of this key ingredient in YEET.<br/>One of the most celebrated health benefits of our CBD oil is its natural analgesic (pain relieving) effects. CBD interacts with receptors in the brain and immune system to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain. <br/>It also helps to relax the mind and body helping you to feel more chilled and happy by improving serotonin levels, which helps to reduce anxiety and improve mental health.<br/>CBD gives you a little buzz, which is difficult to explain in literal terms, but imagine you've just been told some unexpected good news and for the rest of that day you've got a spring in your step. It's like that.</p>
<p><u><strong>Vitamin C - Stronger Immune System</strong></u></p>
<p>Vitamin C is necessary for the growth, development and repair of all body tissues. In other words, it helps to heal everything.<br/>It’s involved in many body functions, including formation of collagen, absorption of iron, the immune system, wound healing, and the maintenance of cartilage, bones, and teeth.<br/>After a night out, usually due to a lack of sleep your immune system will be weaker than usual. Leaving you at a higher risk of catching other illness or fighting anything you may already have.<br/>YEET’s high dosage of Vitamin C will boost your immune system and speed up your post-night  recovery process and reduce the risk of you coming down with any mischievous illnesses. </p>
<p><u><strong>Organic Prickly Pear Extracts - Liver Detoxifier</strong></u> </p>
<p>The fruit of the prickly pear cactus is a lean, green alcohol fighting machine. Grown in Mexico and in Southwestern US, researchers believe that prickly pear extracts can reduce inflammation in the liver caused by a night of heavy boozing — elevating headaches, nausea, dry mouth and other symptoms associated with liver inflammation.</p>
<p><u><strong>Organic Milk Thistle Extracts - Liver Health</strong></u></p>
<p>Milk Thistle was approved in 1986 as a treatment for liver disease and it is widely used on alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver, cirrhosis, liver poisoning and viral hepatitis. The active ingredient or liver-protecting compound in Milk Thistle is known as silymarin. This substance helps repair liver cells damaged by alcohol and other toxic substances by stimulating protein synthesis. By changing the outside layer of liver cells, it also prevents certain toxins from getting inside. Silymarin also encourages liver cell growth. </p>
<p>Put simply, alcohol is bad for your liver, but Milk Thistle is good!</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>Vitamin D - Improves Mood &amp; Energy</strong></u></p>
<p>Vitamin D is naturally absorbed from the sun through our skin and eyes. However with indoor lifestyles becoming increasingly common, Vitamin D deficiency is higher than expected. Every tissue in the body has Vitamin D receptors, including the brain, heart, muscles, and immune system, which means Vitamin D is needed at every level for the body to function. Having a boost in Vitamin D levels can help to reduce fatigue, increase your bodies serotonin production, and facilitate normal immune system function. Generally, giving you more energy.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks, Challenges and Why we are Crowfunding?</strong></u></p>
<p>The recipe is effective and tasty, and the ingredients and suppliers have all been sourced. The main challenge we are facing at the moment, is finding the financial resources to make the commercial batch. We invested every last penny that we had into what was meant to be our first commercial batch on March 10th however, unfortunately on the day of production after only managing to fill the first few bottles, the filters burst and we lost all our ingredients, juice and couldn't bottle the remaining 2650 bottles we were planning on filling. </p>
<p>This wasn't the highlight of Yeet's existence, but we now know how to prevent the issue and are ready to fly again.</p>
<p>Once we manage to produce the ready for consumer sale commercial batch, we will also need to focus on creating a higher quality media presence and image which can portray our premium product in the way that it really is.</p>
<p>We are brand new concept and product so we understand that trust takes time to acquire, but with our crowdfunding we can improve on this by sharing our beverage and getting 1st hand feedback from our saviours and believers who are willing to back us from the very beginning.</p>

<p>Samantha is in her senior year of international business at university. For her, this journey has been a new, exciting and challenging experience that has changed her point of view. “Before the Hult Prize came to my life all I wanted for me was to do a master and work in a multinational company, but since this project I have realized I don’t want to work for any company, I want my own, I want to contribute to the society and help others, so, for me, to reach the Nutri-Aid dream would be the best that can happen”, Samantha Says. “I want to see people smiling and being happy everytime the product gets to their hands, because they will know they are not alone and that help is coming”, she adds.</p>
<p>Samantha has participated in volunteering in hospitals, nursing homes, schools and colleges since she was in high school, so for her, helping others and bring hope and happiness in any way she can has been something that gives sense to her life.</p>
<p>She loves her major and will be graduated by next year. In college she has participated in many political campaigns, reaching the  student body vice-president position of the school of business and economics, and beign the student representative in the college board of education. “Being the voice of students in every corner that can reach many places”, that is her motto.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Max is a graduate in international business of ESPOL, works as a researcher for the Center for Competitiveness and Innovation and the Educate Foundation. He also works for Postgraduate Management School of Management (ESPAE), where he publishes academic articles on industrial studies. He is convinced that knowledge is The most powerful weapon of the peoples and is the tool to change the world. Since Max participated in Hult Prize his vision changed, social entrepreneurship was something that interested him a lot but now he knows that we can not wait for someone to do something, that someone is us, and that's why Max along with Nutri-Aid wants to win Hult prize to change the lives of millions of people who do not have access to food.</p>
<p>Eduardo is in his last semester of school, International Business as well, he has worked in the industry of medical equipment and supplies, imports and sales, also a family business of cacao production and different products of abundance in Ecuador as banana and rice, Which has allowed him to have knowledge of the agricultural wealth of Ecuador, its production capacity and different products with high nutritional  content; Very aware that there is  much more to explore and research in the nutritional area and that it can contribute in a more efficient and effective way to fight malnutrition and hunger worldwide.</p>
<p>Something more that we can say about Eduardo is his passion for service, but a service that also involves knowledge, effort and example to reach more people, has participated in social projects to prevent unwanted pregnancies and addiction to drugs in different High schools of guayaquil as well as youth leader with teachings based on ""what you sow now is what you will reap in the future""</p>
<p>He believes that there is a generation of young people with clear principles willing not to be part any more of the problem, but part of the solution, that is why we have decided to go beyond and start up this idea that has not only changed our lives but will also change the lives of millions.</p>

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>Our team consists of three final year students, currently at Cass Business School. We believe in the potential of our products success, and with your contribution, we will achieve our goal. Welcome to the Glina Family.   </p>
<p><strong>History of Glina </strong></p>
<p>Glina springs from the famous and unique Glina source, located 25 km away from the city of Gjirokastër. The history behind Glina is quite old and well known by traditional medicine for its curative effects. The first scientific study, which shed light on its curative values was done in 1939 by the University of Graz in Austria. Another study conducted from 1980-1990 by the Tirana Nephrology Clinic proved the springs health benefits, promoting everyday usage. The most noted research was initiated in 1948 and lasted until 2008. In 1948, at the University of Prague laboratory, this study analysed the physical and chemical properties of Glina. 1949 dates the complete study and the first scientific communication by Astashkina A., who at the time was a professor of the Faculty of St. Petersburg as well as a member of the Soviet Union’s Ministry of Health commission. Another important communication regarding Glina's steady composition dates back to 1957. This communication was conducted by Agustinshki V. L., at the University of St. Petersburg. After 20 years, the first study conducted in 1969 was done by the state laboratory of Tirana along with the scientific communication by Tabaku, regarding the physical and chemical properties of natural mineral water Glina.

Our team consists of three final year students, currently at Cass Business School. We believe in the potential of our products success, and with your contribution, we will achieve our goal. Welcome to the Glina Family.   
History of Glina 
Glina springs from the famous and unique Glina source, located 25 km away from the city of Gjirokastër. The history behind Glina is quite old and well known by traditional medicine for its curative effects. The first scientific study, which shed light on its curative values was done in 1939 by the University of Graz in Austria. Another study conducted from 1980-1990 by the Tirana Nephrology Clinic proved the springs health benefits, promoting everyday usage. The most noted research was initiated in 1948 and lasted until 2008. In 1948, at the University of Prague laboratory, this study analysed the physical and chemical properties of Glina. 1949 dates the complete study and the first scientific communication by Astashkina A., who at the time was a professor of the Faculty of St. Petersburg as well as a member of the Soviet Union’s Ministry of Health commission. Another important communication regarding Glina's steady composition dates back to 1957. This communication was conducted by Agustinshki V. L., at the University of St. Petersburg. After 20 years, the first study conducted in 1969 was done by the state laboratory of Tirana along with the scientific communication by Tabaku, regarding the physical and chemical properties of natural mineral water Glina. The study concluded that during the twenty year period, the composition of the water did not undergo any changes. This conclusion was reinforced by a study conducted in Germany in 1971 at the Scientific-Research Institute of Frankfurt. In 1989, at the University of Ioannina, the ""Prassos"" firm conducted another study on the water’s composition. In 1990 in New York, the Third Food Division of the Pepsi Cola Company performed a full analysis as well. 
How  will we bottle it? 
Glina will be bottled by the largest retail company in Albania, ‘Agna Group’ .The company has all the necessary conditions because it uses the most advanced bottling technology and the highest quality control system. Certified with the ISO 9001:2015 / ISO 22000:2005, this standard defines all of the requirements of a state-of-the-art food safety management system.

 Prevents  and reduces  kidney stones
Helps treat chronic Gastritis 
Prevents and cures cholesterol 
Prevents and cures  urolithiasis (stones in bladder and urinary track) 
Stimulates digestion

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Delicious, boozy biccies (cookies) from Northern Ireland - delivered to your door and available in retail stores. This is our plan. We've already created the biccies and proven they're popular, with regular online and offline sales, but to meet demand, get into shop and reach new countries - especially America, we need some automation. We also want to make an <strong>Irish-American combo cookie</strong> - Northern Ireland ingredients with American booze, the perfect gift combination.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535023411/wdxamg7lccnnqsvtjozt.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>After 15 years in marketing and sales, Mike took 5 years off to enjoy time with his new daughter.

<p>By contributing to the expansion of Boozy Biccies, you will be making Northern Ireland cookies available worldwide. You'll also be f<i>unding a new Irish-American cookie, plus a range of exciting new cookies,</i> specially created to reflect famous Northern Ireland locations and events.</p>

<p>So <strong>we have a plan for a mini factory</strong> - partly automated, partly manual, all delicious. Our first target is £14,000. This gets a mixer, portioning machine and manual bagging machine. </p>

<h3>Where We Are</h3>
<p>Based on current production capability, we can make about 60 boxes per week, that's 600 iced biscuits, bagged, boxed, postage wrapped and shipped.

During the week we're icing, bagging, boxing and labelling in our own small (licensed) production kitchen and work area.</p>
<p>Our kitchen is in Hillsborough, County Down, a village in the rolling hills, about 30 minutes from Belfast. Our suppliers are no more than a couple of hours away, with most just 20 minutes down the road, making delicious Northern Ireland butter, brewing beer or harvesting honey from their hives.</p>
<p>This is ideal for handmade biscuits, but to serve all of our customers, especially this coming Christmas, we'll need the minimum of portioning machines and bagging equipment. But we'll remain in County Down, using our local suppliers and their unique, delicious Northern Ireland products.</p>

We also want to make an Irish-American combo cookie - Northern Ireland ingredients with American booze, the perfect gift combination.
After 15 years in marketing and sales, Mike took 5 years off to enjoy time with his new daughter. He also retrained as a chef, spotted a gap in the market for local biscuits, and designed a range of delicious alcoholic biscuits, which we are now ready to expand and export.
By contributing to the expansion of Boozy Biccies, you will be making Northern Ireland cookies available worldwide. You'll also be funding a new Irish-American cookie, plus a range of exciting new cookies, specially created to reflect famous Northern Ireland locations and events.

What We Need & What You Get
Making cookies isn't too expensive, with portioning machines and deck ovens costing around £5,000, but enrobers and bagging machines are £20,000-£100,000. Then there's maintenance, premises and people. But we're not going mad just yet. We just want delicious biccies widely available, with your favourite alcohol, at a reasonable price.
So we have a plan for a mini factory - partly automated, partly manual, all delicious. Our first target is £14,000. This gets a mixer, portioning machine and manual bagging machine. 
For £35,000 we can do all of the above and automate bagging, reaching new markets with multiple bagging options for retail and hospitality.
The Perks
We can't give away alcohol as perks - but we can give you discount vouchers to order your alcoholic cookies (Boozy Biccies) on our website.
We also have some exclusive Boozy Biccies beer mats.
Funds

£69,000 provides the funding needed for dedicated premises, equipment and staff.
£49,000+ is a 75% automated mini factory, allowing for worldwide expansion.
£28,000+ is higher production speeds and simple bagging, essential for seasonal surges.
£20,000-£28,000 is faster production with standard bagging and boxing.

Based on current production capability, we can make about 60 boxes per week, that's 600 iced biscuits, bagged, boxed, postage wrapped and shipped.

Risks & Challenges
The two biggest challenges we face are sales targets and production capability. Sales can be achieved, with significant media attention already putting a strain on production, but further marketing will increase demand, which can't be fulfilled using the current handmade methods.
Funding will widen production capability and, increase the opportunity to reach hospitality markets through new bagging methods, which opens up new territories around the world, so everyone can enjoy delicious Boozy Biccies from Northern Ireland.

<h3>Lu-Lu, the modular coffee maker</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Lu-Lu was my attempt of having some fun with a Phin filter I got in Vietnam. I took it apart to learn it a bit and saw that separating the parts allow me to configure my drip in different ways for making different brewing methods.</p>
<p>After many variations of shapes, materials, and filters - Lu-Lu was born. A modular brewer, the Lu-Lu allows you to make a Vietnamese drip, a flat-bottom pour-over, a ""French-press"", a cold-brew, a mudless Turkish, and other recipes.</p>
<p>The modular system, that allows for different brews when assembled differently, is now patented.</p>
<p><br/>I'm Omri Almagor, living in Milano Italy. I've been working in the espresso industry as an engineer and designer for several years. I've worked for Kees Van Der Westen and then Faema, when i decided to start my own activity - Del Creatives S.R.L. - A company focused on innovative products in the field of food extraction, mainly coffee. The Lu-Lu is the first product we're launching, still as a one-man operation, but surrounded by friends and partners (see thanks). </p>
<p>You can (and totally should) follow us on:<br/><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/del.c.coffee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/del.c.coffee/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Lu-Lu launch was planned last summer. April was charted down because of the international festivals, that were all cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Corona also caused delays in receiving different parts, made me cancel marketing events and forced me to substitute a professional photo-shoot in a cafe with computer-camera videos made in my son's kindergarten.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Worldwide, the effects of the Corona virus have been devastating. Lives lost, medical workers overwhelmed and our way of life challenged. This is why I've decided that all the profits from this campaign will be donated to corona related charities around the world and in accordance to the location of the buyers. For every unit you buy, you're giving towards the fight against Corona - you'll be getting your coffee toy and create good karma along the way. </p>
<p>The list of foundations to which the money is directed to will be published and I urge you, if you can, to donate more independently from the Lu-Lu. Also, I'd appreciate your advice in finding other efficient and relevant charities.</p>
<p>To start with, we'll donate directly to Direct Relief. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The Lu-Lu is ready for production, having gone through different versions of prototyping and testing. However, to start production a first amount is needed for molds and bulk orders. Therefor we've turned to Indiegogo to pre-sale the required amount of units that will supply the remainder of the sum needed to start production.</li>
<li>All the profits will go towards Covid-19 related charitable organizations. This is a fixed-funding campaign, which means failing to reach the minimum amount needed to start production will cancel the orders that were received and each buyer will be refunded. </li>
<li>After the campaign concludes (60 days) and given that we have reached the minimum sum of the project, the money will become available to us in Del-Creatives S.R.L. and production will get on the way. Customers should expect their orders within 6-8 weeks from that point. Once reaching the minimum, we will start to gradually transfer the profits towards the chosen charities. The profits will be donated on a quarterly basis. The more we sell through this campaign, the higher the profits are and the more money is directed towards fighting Corona.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<div><p> </p></div>
<h3>To make some things perfectly clear:</h3>
<p>--- All the profits from the Lu-Lu will go towards Corona relief efforts:</p>
<p>All the profits made from the Lu-Lu campaign on Indiegogo will be transferred to charities aiding in Corona relief around the world. The charities will be chosen according to the advice and local of the contributors to the campaign. There are certain limitations to this:</p>
<p>The profits will be donated as long as Corona is deemed a world pandemic and not prior to donating at least 250,000$. After reaching that donation goal, we will continue to donate 5% of the profits towards other social projects indefinitely.  </p>
<p>Profits are not gross proceeds. The amount of money shown on the campaign's page is the gross proceeds from the Lu-Lu. Profits represent the net proceeds after covering all expenses, fees and taxes.</p>
<p>We will constantly update on the amount of profits donated. We expect the donate-able sum will increase in a non-linear way the more the campaign gains momentum. Also, there will be always be a quarterly delay between the gross proceeds and the donations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--- Making the delivery date</p>
<p>Lu-Lu is in pre-production state. This means we've already had a first small production series using short-life tools. We're now ready for the next step, having validated all the designs and functions. As mentioned before, this is the first product the company is launching, and to reduce risks, we've decided to use the pre-sale option of indiegogo. Only when reaching the sales' goal, do we transfer the initial payments to the suppliers and start production. We've estimated to be ready for shipment within 4 weeks of reaching the financial goal, but as Corona has proven to us, our time tables are not our own any more. We will convey all the information and update you on the progress and any delays we're expecting.</p>

The profits will be donated on a quarterly basis. The more we sell through this campaign, the higher the profits are and the more money is directed towards fighting Corona.


 
 
To make some things perfectly clear:
--- All the profits from the Lu-Lu will go towards Corona relief efforts:
All the profits made from the Lu-Lu campaign on Indiegogo will be transferred to charities aiding in Corona relief around the world. The charities will be chosen according to the advice and local of the contributors to the campaign. There are certain limitations to this:
The profits will be donated as long as Corona is deemed a world pandemic and not prior to donating at least 250,000$. After reaching that donation goal, we will continue to donate 5% of the profits towards other social projects indefinitely.  
Profits are not gross proceeds. The amount of money shown on the campaign's page is the gross proceeds from the Lu-Lu. Profits represent the net proceeds after covering all expenses, fees and taxes.
We will constantly update on the amount of profits donated. We expect the donate-able sum will increase in a non-linear way the more the campaign gains momentum. Also, there will be always be a quarterly delay between the gross proceeds and the donations.
 
--- Making the delivery date
Lu-Lu is in pre-production state. This means we've already had a first small production series using short-life tools. We're now ready for the next step, having validated all the designs and functions. As mentioned before, this is the first product the company is launching, and to reduce risks, we've decided to use the pre-sale option of indiegogo. Only when reaching the sales' goal, do we transfer the initial payments to the suppliers and start production. We've estimated to be ready for shipment within 4 weeks of reaching the financial goal, but as Corona has proven to us, our time tables are not our own any more. We will convey all the information and update you on the progress and any delays we're expecting.

<p>BatchBuddy's cocktail making kits harness the power of batching, a technique used by expert mixologists that's based on mixing a large quantity ingredients all at once. BatchBuddy's cocktail batching kits allow its users, regardless of experience, to create perfect cocktails in record time without the hassle of complicated recipes or expensive equipment.  BatchBuddy kits come complete with a specially-created batching bottle for a specific classic cocktail to create a world-class perfect serve every time.</p>

<p>The BatchBuddy team spent over 15 years in the industry as the owner of various venues and has always championed the power of batching. The technique has become more popular as cocktail popularity has peaked because it streamlines cocktail service so that customers don’t have to wait. We’ve taken the technique and made it consumer-friendly too.</p>

<p>BatchBuddy aims to take the hassle out of cocktail-making for bars, restaurants, and consumers alike to recreate their favorite drinks in record time at home without experience, fancy equipment or traditional recipes. The biggest benefits to our product are convenience, consistency, and cost.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>John and Damian both have been involved in the cocktail world for more than 15 years each, training, competing and innovating in all aspects of the increasing vibrant mixology scene. Throughout these years of perfecting their craft one unassuming technique was called upon time after time…. Batching!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Batching is the technique of making multiple servings of a particular cocktail at one time. The guys at BatchBuddy have been using “batching” in all sorts of cocktails, from 50 servings of the cocktail of the week at any number of busy cocktail bars to 1500 Cosmos at a live music event. Batching ensures quality, consistency and saves a bucket load of time. It’s just made cocktails easy. Oh, and did we mention you don’t need all the fancy pants cocktail equipment like measures, shakers, strainers and the like?</p>
<p>So, we got to thinking, why isn’t everybody batching their cocktails? Why are people constantly struggling with that cocktail shaker that they got for their last birthday? How do we make it easy for everybody to get involved in the batching revolution?</p>
<p>Well, now we have…. Ladies and gentlemen……. BatchBuddy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>There may be some unexpected situations that occur. However, we will minimize the risk best we can and welcome any challenges as they come with the problem-solving attitude that already runs through the BatchBuddy team. We have our first Batching Kits prototypes made, tested and already bringing delight to the glasses of many of our early adopters.

</div></div>","Here at BatchBuddy, we have created a range of 'Cocktail Batching Bottles' that transforms how cocktails are made. Simply pick your BatchBuddy bottle, gather your ingredients, fill to the lines, chill & garnish. Perfect, consistent cocktails.
 
 

 
BatchBuddy's cocktail making kits harness the power of batching, a technique used by expert mixologists that's based on mixing a large quantity ingredients all at once. BatchBuddy's cocktail batching kits allow its users, regardless of experience, to create perfect cocktails in record time without the hassle of complicated recipes or expensive equipment.  BatchBuddy kits come complete with a specially-created batching bottle for a specific classic cocktail to create a world-class perfect serve every time.
 


 
We all enjoy and appreciate the art of mixology, hence why cocktails continue to become more and more popular. However, cocktail-making is historically an expert craft taking years to perfect just one recipe.   
 

 
We are launching our first set of batching bottles, focusing on the much-loved classic cocktails, such as the gin-based Bramble and the vodka-based Cosmopolitan.
 

 

 

 
The BatchBuddy team spent over 15 years in the industry as the owner of various venues and has always championed the power of batching. The technique has become more popular as cocktail popularity has peaked because it streamlines cocktail service so that customers don’t have to wait. We’ve taken the technique and made it consumer-friendly too.
 

BatchBuddy aims to take the hassle out of cocktail-making for bars, restaurants, and consumers alike to recreate their favorite drinks in record time at home without experience, fancy equipment or traditional recipes. The biggest benefits to our product are convenience, consistency, and cost.
 
John and Damian both have been involved in the cocktail world for more than 15 years each, training, competing and innovating in all aspects of the increasing vibrant mixology scene. Throughout these years of perfecting their craft one unassuming technique was called upon time after time…. Batching!
 
 
Batching is the technique of making multiple servings of a particular cocktail at one time. The guys at BatchBuddy have been using “batching” in all sorts of cocktails, from 50 servings of the cocktail of the week at any number of busy cocktail bars to 1500 Cosmos at a live music event. Batching ensures quality, consistency and saves a bucket load of time. It’s just made cocktails easy. Oh, and did we mention you don’t need all the fancy pants cocktail equipment like measures, shakers, strainers and the like?
So, we got to thinking, why isn’t everybody batching their cocktails? Why are people constantly struggling with that cocktail shaker that they got for their last birthday? How do we make it easy for everybody to get involved in the batching revolution?
Well, now we have…. Ladies and gentlemen……. BatchBuddy!
 
Risks and challenges
There may be some unexpected situations that occur. However, we will minimize the risk best we can and welcome any challenges as they come with the problem-solving attitude that already runs through the BatchBuddy team. We have our first Batching Kits prototypes made, tested and already bringing delight to the glasses of many of our early adopters. We have signed agreements with our suppliers and taken as much time and care as possible to ensure the whole process goes smoothly from been fully funded to delivering our first orders. To ensure our backers stay fully informed we will be updating regularly on our progress throughout the campaign and delivery process.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>1- HOW IT ALL STARTED</strong></h3>
<p>I am a keen sailor and that is why 3 years ago I was surprised that my vitamin D3 was low and bone density test has been OK for my age but was getting closer to bottom limit. I called my 81yo mum who by the way is not on any medication and told her I am about to start taking vitamin D3 tablets and Calcium etc. It was at that point she reminded me of existence of Korytnica. 12th century old 100% pure and natural mineral water from European National Park as child I loved to drink. Eastern Europe knows of Korytnica's health benefits. I asked my sister to start sending me bottles by air and I paid $10 AUD per each 500ml bottle. After while we went to Europe on holiday and popped to Korytnica (place) and rest is history. We got initially few pallets and the news and stories spread quickly.  </p>
<p>Not only we no longer pay $10 AUD for a bottle but thanks to generosity of people in Korytnica we can now help Australians who can benefit from drinking 12th Century old pure awesomeness once loved by kings as well. </p>
<p>So here we are hoping that with your help more and more Australians will enjoy health benefits of Korytnica proudly wearing upcoming T-Shirts or sticking stickers on window of their cars.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504000189/zptbqyiviaqqhbxtabrb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Our 81 years ""young"" mum who started it ALL - WE LOVE YOU MUM :)   </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2 - MAGIC CONTENT OF KORYTNICA</strong></h3>
<p>We have decided to approach all Australian entrepreneur minded indiegogo people &amp; teams to help us with the Launch and produce great underdog winning story benefiting health of all Australians in need. </p>
<p>Just look what kind of natural goodness is in 1 liter of Korytnica ""as nature intended"". </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503891175/mgilhwqy7ruft2tezchn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Every bottle of Korytnica also contains 48mg/L of silica which is great for hair/skin/nails and 1300mg/L of alkaline buffers (bicarbonates) helping with digestion. </p>
<p>By all means we do not say to people to ditch pure water and start drinking nothing but Korytnica. What we saying is that if you make Korytnica part of your drinking regime even if it is occasional but regular it helps. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2 - HEALTH BENEFITS  </strong></h3>
<p>Korytnica is simply a mineral water brewed by nature for centuries. But unlike other brands the mother nature happened to mix levels of Calcium, Magnesium and other minerals in such levels and ratios that it perfectly fits RDI needs of human body. </p>
<p>Looking at table above you have probably guessed it. Korytnica positively helps where minerals like Ca, Mg, Silica, Buffers, Iron ions are known for: Osteoporosis, Osteopenia, Digestion, Anemia, Bones Health, Muscles. </p>
<p><strong>Note for geeks:</strong> Bones are like muscles ""They get stronger not just by drinking Ca, Mg but crucially also by healthy diet and safe mechanical loading and exercise so your body knows you use bones"". Plus it is a matter of regularity not occasionality.  </p>
<p><strong>Mum's wisdom note: </strong>""Regular occasional"" is in most cases better than ""Sporadic Spike Quantity"". </p>
<p><strong>For more info:</strong> <a href=""mailto:info@korytnica.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@korytnica.com.au</a></p>
<p>**Consultation with experts to get ideal drinking regime is recommended. </p>
<p>*** Korytnica is not supplements!. It is simply a very rare mineral water perfected by nature that happened to be produced by nature while constellation of stars was right. </p>
<p>**** There are only 3-4 other mineral waters in Europe with similar composition but Korytnica has lowest level of salt (suitable for cardiovascular and diabetic consumers). Further it contains highest level of Ca &amp; Mg our of all mineral waters in Europe in correct RDI ratio for human body. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>3 - PARTY TIME</strong></h3>
<p>We have not forgotten young generation that likes to party. And why not to party with some cool health benefits too? Why? Because each of the flavored Korytnica is based on Korytnica Sparkling still containing all goodness in form of minerals (Ca, Mg, Si, etc.). Only high quality syrup from Austria is used in production complimenting quality of mineral water used as base.</p>
<p>There is around 90mg/L of sugar which is about 30% less than those is Coke and similar drinks. Plus Korytnica has 100% natural bubbles (no artificial CO2!!) and as such you will not get ""brain freeze"" drinking Korytnica:) </p>
<p>If our kids ask for soft drink on Birthday Party we as parents go for Korytnica adding some </p>
<p>non-flavored just in case.  </p>

<p><strong>a Map of uncharted territory</strong></p>
<p>Can something as simple as a bar of chocolate turn a head, spin a tune, conjure a time + place long forgotten, recall a day of sun and sand on the darkest of winter evenings? Make us stand up, fall over, laugh out loud, or our heart skip a beat? Get us to dive deeper, twirl a hand through a wisp of a dream? Can a teensy bite turn a whole life of wondering what? into a single thought of <i>this.</i></p>
<p>Heck yeah, it can.</p>
<p><strong>how small you begin has nothing to do with how far you will go.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486410126/xomfhfgdgpfwycb9eqlg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Map began with a $50 purchase of beans and a tiny borrowed grinder. It was scary, exciting, mind-blowing: making chocolate. As in <i>making</i> chocolate, not melting pre-made blocks or chips, but taking handfuls of cocoa beans, roasting them, winnowing the shell away, then putting the nibs into the grinder where suddenly the flavor inside began to say chocolate. I made my first batch, a brave soul took a bite of the chocolate and said more please. And that's when I knew.</p>
<p>The doing of it and the idea of being a chocolate maker made me immeasurably happy. Ok, I did (and still do) a few skips and sometimes still shriek when the whole workshop smells like baking brownie (amazing), but happy is a short path. It needs to go somewhere, and is not something to sit on or keep tucked somewhere safe and warm: it need to fluff its lil feathers and fly, head out into the world. Kick up a ruckus, maybe stir a few emotions, and on a good day, open some eyes. Happy felt good, but seeing somebody else happy with a Map in their hands was incredible. </p>
<p><strong>why we chocolate.</strong></p>
<p>Chocolate is not just a flavor to crave, but a food group. A stand-in for the day when your best friend is MIA, a breakfast food, a bartering tool when words are not enough, a currency of kindness, a fine and lovely thread wrapping round the world. It is all these things and the Map is just our way of saying <i>go see for yourself</i>.  </p>
<p><strong>er, actually it's Mackenzie and People.</strong></p>
<p>The cacao beans I use in making chocolate pass through many hands: the hands of farmers who planted and tended the trees, harvested the cacao pods and split them open, the folks who fermented and dried the beans and used their wisdom, experience, and know-how to bring those beans one step closer to what we even think of as chocolate. There are hardworking people who earn their livelihood tending cacao and sending it to makers like me so we can make chocolate and send it back into the world.</p>
<p>A cacao bean in its raw state is a far cry from what we have come to think of as chocolate. And this is part of the magic and beauty, and of course, the journey from bean to bar: every bean has a story to tell, and the language it speaks is chocolate. We just have to be willing to let it speak, and do our part to listen, and taste. And pass it along. </p>
<p><b>chocolate is our jam</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486407152/kigwizsbqvjjzlch8r1a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As a solopreneur I source + sample the different cacao origins, then test + design the chocolate bar formulations (math after high school! who knew). I do every step of the bean to bar process, from roasting to winnowing, to grinding, overseeing the conching, tasting (#dreamjob), to tempering by hand (#oldschool) and pouring the silken chocolate into the bar moulds.

<p>Sam Ratto of Videri Chocolate, a highly respected longtime chocolate maker and one of the pioneers of craft chocolate has designed and created the first small-batch grinder <i>made </i>by a chocolate maker, test-driven by a chocolate maker, <i>for</i> chocolate makers. This is revolutionary and high-five worthy because until he did, most makers begin with small wet grinders that are designed for grinding spices. The small grinders work well enough, but also, are consistently inconsistent and unreliable (and did I mention they catch on fire?) Simply, they are being asked to do a job they weren't designed to do (cardamom is not cacao). The reason chocolate makers use the grinders is because before craft chocolate came to be chocolate was made in big factories, using industrial processes, and industrial-scaled equipment. In other words, we've had no choice. So we make chocolate and buy the next size up spice grinder, and sometimes this works, for awhile. But Sam said it best:</p>
<p><strong>""There’s nothing like chocolate. We love its smell, its texture, its variety and versatility. But it’s not enough to just love chocolate. We also have to respect it. We go to preposterous lengths finding and refining the best cocoa beans. What does it say about our love if we toss our hard-won prize into the cruel mouth of an ill-designed grinder? Rottar is the small-batch grinder chocolate deserves. It was designed for chocolate makers, by chocolate makers, to help those extraordinary little beans achieve their full, delicious potential.""</strong></p>
<p>Dear Sam, did we mention we love you?</p>
<p><strong>the idea of an authentic tool, well-designed, intended for small-batch bean to bar is like music to our chocolate making and lovin' ears.</strong></p>
<p>And we need one. In order to stay small <strong>and </strong>keep the craft in Map Chocolate,  it is time for a bigger grinder. One that is designed well, made well, and aligns with why we make chocolate in the first place. The <a href=""http://www.rottar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rottar</a> small-batch chocolate grinder is:</p>
<p>Designed, tested, and used by a chocolate maker, for chocolate makers.</p>
<p>Built in America. </p>
<p>Has a 100 kilogram drum capacity. Map currently runs 5 (yes, 5!) very small 8-pound grinders at a time, 24/7 and then some, though due to the consistent unreliability it is rare all are up and running simultaneously #bummer #apologiesforthewait The time in loading, cleaning, repairing these *&amp;##@! charming little melangeurs can be better focused on one well-designed reliable grinder. One grinder to load, to empty, to clean. </p>
<p>The Rottar has granite wheels sourced in North Carolina (read: of known origin, manufacture, sustainability), a direct drive motor, stainless steel drum. </p>
<p>The icing on the chocolate-making cake: It will be built for Map and custom-installed in the Map workshop by the Ratto brothers. </p>

<p><strong>and...the toast that goes hand in hand with that jam we mentioned earlier.</strong></p>
<p><strong>our Indiegogo campaign is for the $25,000</strong> needed to buy the Rottar grinder. </p>
<p>Our campaign is All Or Nothing: we raise enough or we can't buy the grinder. I could have ticked the box for Flexible Funding, which would mean Map could keep whatever amount was raised but. BUT. This is what Map needs. </p>
<p>And here is where I'm supposed to tell you why the world needs Map Chocolate. </p>
<p>It is what I ask myself everyday. What I wonder while roasting the beans, what I think about when I sit down to calculate how many pounds of beans I need to buy and see a road in the distance with a shimmering mirage that seems to say <i>how...</i>it's what I ask when I peruse a wall of fine and lovely chocolate bars and see a Map on the self right beside some of my chocolate-making heroes, and what I question at 4 am when I begin tempering the first batch of what will be a beautiful day.</p>
<p>And I say <strong>yes</strong>. A whopping big yes to the need for small makers like me who bring our handful of joy into the world, and sometimes with a little note inside because we want to do it that way. Yes to small as a business model, because if Map can do it then somebody else can see and believe in and pursue their dream too. And yes to Map because it's not just about me: Map is Mackenzie, but from there the journey goes to And People. I'm here because it's the people part where the beauty of the story begins to unfurl. I make the chocolate, folks (hello there and thank you) buy it and eat it and share it and stash it, and many times, tell me they love it. All the while a cacao tree is rising toward the sun, a bird flits beyond the leaves, a hand reaches toward a ripened pod, beans are loaded and hauled and shipped, and land at the Map workshop and I take a look and say hello there. Finally, after such a long journey one day someone takes a bite. And from there the story unfolds, all the way around the world, 20 degrees North or South of the equator this story grows, encircling this sweetly spinning planet with the most beautiful of storytelling foods.</p>
<p>So yes. Yes to more love, more chocolate, and building the Map.</p>
<p><strong>what it will mean to Map</strong></p>
<p>We will be able to keep making the chocolate we make, pouring in every ounce of our not-like-anybody-else's inspiration we put into each and every bar. Without the grinder Map is not sustainable. End of story.</p>

Can something as simple as a bar of chocolate turn a head, spin a tune, conjure a time + place long forgotten, recall a day of sun and sand on the darkest of winter evenings? Make us stand up, fall over, laugh out loud, or our heart skip a beat? Get us to dive deeper, twirl a hand through a wisp of a dream? Can a teensy bite turn a whole life of wondering what? into a single thought of this.
Heck yeah, it can.
how small you begin has nothing to do with how far you will go.

Map began with a $50 purchase of beans and a tiny borrowed grinder. It was scary, exciting, mind-blowing: making chocolate. As in making chocolate, not melting pre-made blocks or chips, but taking handfuls of cocoa beans, roasting them, winnowing the shell away, then putting the nibs into the grinder where suddenly the flavor inside began to say chocolate. I made my first batch, a brave soul took a bite of the chocolate and said more please. And that's when I knew.
The doing of it and the idea of being a chocolate maker made me immeasurably happy. Ok, I did (and still do) a few skips and sometimes still shriek when the whole workshop smells like baking brownie (amazing), but happy is a short path. It needs to go somewhere, and is not something to sit on or keep tucked somewhere safe and warm: it need to fluff its lil feathers and fly, head out into the world. Kick up a ruckus, maybe stir a few emotions, and on a good day, open some eyes. Happy felt good, but seeing somebody else happy with a Map in their hands was incredible. 
why we chocolate.
Chocolate is not just a flavor to crave, but a food group. A stand-in for the day when your best friend is MIA, a breakfast food, a bartering tool when words are not enough, a currency of kindness, a fine and lovely thread wrapping round the world. It is all these things and the Map is just our way of saying go see for yourself.  
er, actually it's Mackenzie and People.
The cacao beans I use in making chocolate pass through many hands: the hands of farmers who planted and tended the trees, harvested the cacao pods and split them open, the folks who fermented and dried the beans and used their wisdom, experience, and know-how to bring those beans one step closer to what we even think of as chocolate. There are hardworking people who earn their livelihood tending cacao and sending it to makers like me so we can make chocolate and send it back into the world.
A cacao bean in its raw state is a far cry from what we have come to think of as chocolate. And this is part of the magic and beauty, and of course, the journey from bean to bar: every bean has a story to tell, and the language it speaks is chocolate. We just have to be willing to let it speak, and do our part to listen, and taste. And pass it along. 
chocolate is our jam

As a solopreneur I source + sample the different cacao origins, then test + design the chocolate bar formulations (math after high school! who knew). I do every step of the bean to bar process, from roasting to winnowing, to grinding, overseeing the conching, tasting (#dreamjob), to tempering by hand (#oldschool) and pouring the silken chocolate into the bar moulds. I built + maintain the Map website, design and make the wrappers for the bars and all the labels for the range of Map Chocolate products (the Map cold brew featured by Bloomberg Business Review, hot drinking chocolates, a line of chocolate granola, craft chocolate pantry goods, and tasting kits). I'm the email-answerer, bill payer, stockist invoicer, floor sweeper and dish washer, and Map's social media writer and communicator. I'm proud that after two years of crafting chocolate (happy 3rd year anniversary March 14, Map!) my work has been featured in blog posts , reviews, magazine articles, I've been asked to write for a major dessert trade publication, interviewed in podcasts, and handed some blush-worthy kudos for Map's bars. 
It's in the Map DNA: our belief that the most over-rated travel itinerary goes straight from Point A to Point B.

Map has been built as a self-funding business: kind folks buy our chocolate, revenue comes in, and we've used that to purchase equipment piece by piece, materials for the wrappers, and beans. Lots and lots of beans. Our first step toward helping Map grow its reach was to move into a new workshop in 2016, so as our sales increased (thank you, truly) that has been used for the fixtures, plumbing, rent, etc. 
We do chocolate old school, and that is better than okay. We're building not just a business, crafting not just a livelihood, but building a Map for doing life well on a small scale, one happy bite at a time.
This means a mindful process of growth hand-in-hand with scaling.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi guys we are Cristiano and Andrea. <br/>We are the founders of PickyWops.</p>
<p>PickyWops is an ethical Modern Italian Pizzeria, 100% Vegan which offer a selection of 7 alternative options to the most processed flours.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541683129/mjflbg4vgk9kfzfiyuxg.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541676230/uwhtj2jbzi4u2klpihde.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our bases are wholemeal and type2 flours only (top quality), with 2 ancient grains and we are the only pizzeria in the country offering a Plantain Fruitarian Pizza.</p>

<p>We open our first shop in September 2016 as an omni Pizzeria, offering also meat and dairy until, I (Cristiano) became Vegan in January 2017, thanks to Veganuary. Andrea turned Vegan in March the same year.</p>
<p>When both of us made the jump we decided in 2 weeks to ditch all the animal products out of our shop FOREVER. On 2nd of April 2017, PickyWops took a leap and was reborn as a fully vegan business. We are as proud to have made that decision as we were on that day.</p>
<p>It was the best decision we ever made! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541676559/meht3mt8wewzz0tyzm14.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our vegan pizza won the second place to an omni Pizza competition in 2016. From all the Italian Pizza Chefs that entered, we were the only ones with Vegan Pizzas! So proud! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541676682/xldg5jbw1vfmfz6awf0r.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We also successfully attended Eat Drink Vegan which is one of the largest Vegan Festivals in USA, from which we met so many beautiful people from the industry who we consider our family in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>We have been also listed as the best Vegan Pizza in the World on Happy Cow updated Feb 2018!</p>

<p>We collaborated also with influencers from all over the World in the video above with EpiVegan.</p>
<p>In December 2017 we open our second shop in a project which was advertised as community focused and inclined to help young independent businesses. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it revealed to be completely different to what was advertised. In addition to misleading promises we had to deal with very abusive working conditions, health issues and received no support from the corporate running the project. </p>
<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/ws9wSo8oorY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/ws9wSo8oorY</a></p>
<p>In August this year, in order to open a bigger shop, our shareholder suggested we close the doors to our first lovely shop in Fulham. While dealing with a new location near by, </p>
<p>Unfortunately our investor pulled out of the relocation, due to the extremely high running cost of our second shop. We now are without a place to be at the end of this month. </p>
<p>This is the reason why we need your help.. We cannot give up and this is our chance to get better and stronger and we cannot do it without you!!</p>
<p>So we put together a bunch of nice, fun Perks in exchange of your support from a simple Thanks to a Lifetime Pizza Card!!</p>
<p>If you believe in us please share and support us!!</p>
<p>Peace</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>more detail:</p>
<p>We would need £60000 to be able to help us and cover all the opening costs of the restaurant.</p>
<p>We appreciate any contribution and you can get in exchange lots of nice and fun perks like Pizza, Merchandising, Classes, Parties and more to come.</p>
<p>If we shouldn't reach entire goal we are going to set up whatever we can with the funds reached.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>POETRY</h3>
<p><b>What makes PickyWops different is the variety of pizza dough we offer, which are all unique in flavor, color and texture. </b></p>
<p><b>The PickyWops concept is also about welcoming all the communities, regardless of their background, opinion or colors.</b></p>
<p><b>PickyWops aims to bring everyone together and immerse itself in the community.</b></p>
<p><strong>Just like the Wops.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes exactly like our ancestors who migrated in search of a dream.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>MEANING</h3>
<p>Picky = fussy and hard to please...<br/>(you can actually pick your base)</p>
<p>Wops = offensive &amp; racist word used to define<br/>Italians in 1900. origin uncertain,<br/>perhaps from Italian GUAPPO ‘bold, showy’<br/>(Cristiano and Andrea are 2 Italian immigrants!)</p>
<p><br/>Because we are the first and the only ones in town to use many different alternative flours.</p>
<p>Because we are against any type of discrimination.</p>
<p>Because we look at contents not labels,</p>
<p>we are proud to take our Ancestors Heritage and change the Wops connotation into something positive.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is going to support the only Fruitarian Plantain Pizza (Gluten Free) in the UK and the possible expansion (National and International).</p>
<p>also the only one in London offering a selection of 6 Top Quality flours with 2 ancient grains.</p>
<p>Your contribution will keep alive an Ethical business in a World where Ethics are seen as a weakness.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a very difficult journey full of obstacles and challenges but we are trained to take it in the best way. In the past 2 years we have been going through so many adversity which we always handle with the most transparency, respect and ethics.</p>
<p>Facing the problems with positive mind so far it's been the key for us to get better outcomes every single time.</p>

Hi guys we are Cristiano and Andrea. We are the founders of PickyWops.
PickyWops is an ethical Modern Italian Pizzeria, 100% Vegan which offer a selection of 7 alternative options to the most processed flours.

Our bases are wholemeal and type2 flours only (top quality), with 2 ancient grains and we are the only pizzeria in the country offering a Plantain Fruitarian Pizza.
Check the link below on the MedicalDaily facebook page:

We open our first shop in September 2016 as an omni Pizzeria, offering also meat and dairy until, I (Cristiano) became Vegan in January 2017, thanks to Veganuary. Andrea turned Vegan in March the same year.
When both of us made the jump we decided in 2 weeks to ditch all the animal products out of our shop FOREVER. On 2nd of April 2017, PickyWops took a leap and was reborn as a fully vegan business. We are as proud to have made that decision as we were on that day.
It was the best decision we ever made! 

Our vegan pizza won the second place to an omni Pizza competition in 2016. From all the Italian Pizza Chefs that entered, we were the only ones with Vegan Pizzas! So proud! 

We also successfully attended Eat Drink Vegan which is one of the largest Vegan Festivals in USA, from which we met so many beautiful people from the industry who we consider our family in Los Angeles.
We have been also listed as the best Vegan Pizza in the World on Happy Cow updated Feb 2018!

We collaborated also with influencers from all over the World in the video above with EpiVegan.
In December 2017 we open our second shop in a project which was advertised as community focused and inclined to help young independent businesses. 
Unfortunately it revealed to be completely different to what was advertised. In addition to misleading promises we had to deal with very abusive working conditions, health issues and received no support from the corporate running the project. 
https://youtu.be/ws9wSo8oorY
In August this year, in order to open a bigger shop, our shareholder suggested we close the doors to our first lovely shop in Fulham. While dealing with a new location near by, 
Unfortunately our investor pulled out of the relocation, due to the extremely high running cost of our second shop. We now are without a place to be at the end of this month. 
This is the reason why we need your help.. We cannot give up and this is our chance to get better and stronger and we cannot do it without you!!
So we put together a bunch of nice, fun Perks in exchange of your support from a simple Thanks to a Lifetime Pizza Card!!
If you believe in us please share and support us!!
Peace

What We Need & What You Get
more detail:
We would need £60000 to be able to help us and cover all the opening costs of the restaurant.
We appreciate any contribution and you can get in exchange lots of nice and fun perks like Pizza, Merchandising, Classes, Parties and more to come.
If we shouldn't reach entire goal we are going to set up whatever we can with the funds reached.
 
POETRY
What makes PickyWops different is the variety of pizza dough we offer, which are all unique in flavor, color and texture. 
The PickyWops concept is also about welcoming all the communities, regardless of their background, opinion or colors.
PickyWops aims to bring everyone together and immerse itself in the community.
Just like the Wops.
Yes exactly like our ancestors who migrated in search of a dream.
 
MEANING
Picky = fussy and hard to please...(you can actually pick your base)
Wops = offensive & racist word used to defineItalians in 1900. origin uncertain,perhaps from Italian GUAPPO ‘bold, showy’(Cristiano and Andrea are 2 Italian immigrants!)
Because we are the first and the only ones in town to use many different alternative flours.
Because we are against any type of discrimination.
Because we look at contents not labels,
we are proud to take our Ancestors Heritage and change the Wops connotation into something positive.

The Impact
Your contribution is going to support the only Fruitarian Plantain Pizza (Gluten Free) in the UK and the possible expansion (National and International).
also the only one in London offering a selection of 6 Top Quality flours with 2 ancient grains.
Your contribution will keep alive an Ethical business in a World where Ethics are seen as a weakness.

Risks & Challenges
This is a very difficult journey full of obstacles and challenges but we are trained to take it in the best way. In the past 2 years we have been going through so many adversity which we always handle with the most transparency, respect and ethics.
Facing the problems with positive mind so far it's been the key for us to get better outcomes every single time.

<h3>Raphael's Donuts (Who we are):</h3>
<p>Raphael's Donuts is a 100% vegan &amp; low glycemic (diabetic-friendly), allergy-friendly donut online home delivery and mail order company that is on a mission to change people's lifestyles and the donut industry as a whole with delicious baked donuts that don't cause harm to animals, humans' overall health, or even the environment. Raphael's Donuts is the world's only online donut company in history in its own kind baked in gluten free (chickpea) and whole wheat flour versions in 11 year-round flavors. We use organic agave nectar, xylitol, herbal teas, fruit juices, chia, hemp, and flax seeds in our donuts. No gmos, peanuts, tree nuts, coconuts, yeast, soy or animal ingredients of all kinds are ever used in them, since we became 100% vegan in June 2017. </p>
<p><b>From our inspiration of birth to now! </b></p>
<p>Raphael's Donuts was launched in May 2014 as a lacto-ovo-vegetarian low glycemic (diabetic-friendly) donut company out of inspiration from owner/masterbaker Raphael Harlan's deceased adoptive mother Cora Lee Harlan's 2011 death of kidney disease as she was an omnivorous diabetic who loved baked desserts but couldn't have donuts because no company or person was making low glycemic donuts in her 75 year lifetime before it was never done before. By him being a long time healthnut, self-taught unique gourmet baker, and an experienced entrepreneur, the Raphael's Donuts concept came in a dream in Fall 2013 and after testing out my imaginatively unique donut recipes and having former UM-Flint professors and classmates test-tasting them, Raphael's Donuts was born with him putting $600 of his own money into it. </p>

<p>Even though we started slow in the first 17 months as a non-vegan low glycemic donut company doing mostly Genesee County farmers markets and vendor events with two occasions having our donuts carried in a Flint, Michigan-based health food store, averaging six dozen sold a month due to our clientele being limited, our donuts were loved, enjoyed, and appreciated by most of our customers back then and because of that -- along with us winning our only business grant competition of $1500 from the rotary club, we made changes in the business model in late 2015 which involved us downsizing our production scale back to our home kitchen production, creating a new base recipe, and switching to online sales with the yearround home delivery service launching in November 2015. The adjustments resulted in more than half of our flavors being veganized (which got us more vegan customers than non-vegan customers) and more as our monthly sales grew and our annual revenue grew, and they also led us not only into Raphael himself going full vegan in September 2016 but also Raphael's Donuts as a rebounding and growing company going 100% vegan in June 2017 with our donuts also being free of tree nuts, soy, yeast, peanuts, coconuts, or GMOs as it's been the case since November 2015. Those changes and adjustments have resulted in three consecutive years with high annual revenues, growth in employee base as we currently have five employees and a business, sales, and customer service manager and partner, bigger sales average, us being featured in many publications (such as <a href=""http://www.fox2detroit.com/good-day/meatless-mondays/raphaels-donuts-serving-up-health-conscious-donuts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fox 2 Detroit</a>, <a href=""https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2018/02/baker_creates_diabetic_vegan_f.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flint Journal</a>, and others) and us expanding to nationwide mail order earlier this year. We also have many five star reviews and positive testimonials as well as over 4,300 likes on our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/raphaeldonuts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a>, showing that more customers widespread are in love with our donuts and us!</p>
<p>We currently do Mid and Southeastern Michigan home delivery and nationwide mail order yearround selling half dozen and dozen packs &amp; sample packs on our <a href=""http://raphaelharlan.wixsite.com/raphaelsdonuts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, along with vendor events selling doubles (2packs) and triples (3packs) seasonally, mostly during the summer months. We also sell fundraising orders to non profit organizations and businesses  Recently we have a Dexter, MI-based cider mill selling our gluten free vegan donuts and because of it, we were able to maximize our current monthly baking capacity that the cottage law allows us to do because they were selling out almost every week. Now we are in a dire need to expand and scale back up to a rental commercial kitchen setting so we can continue to not only fulfill more cider mill orders but more future wholesale orders from potential retailers and restaurants, alongside our e-commerce yearround channels and seasonal vendor events. Our long term vision as a pioneering vegan donut company of its kind is to not only bring Americans and the rest of the world uniquely healthy and tasty vegan donuts as part of their lives in the best ways -- through mail orders and through retailers of all size ---  but also change their lives through other non-donut baked desserts as we see ourselves doing many  healthy vegan donut product lines as well as non-donut baked desserts. With your contributions, we will be one step closer to doing so! </p>

If we reach our full goal (<strong>$9000</strong>) or exceed it, we will also donate 5% of our future monthly wholesale sales to an animal sanctuary of our choosing. </p>

<h2>
<strong>Lupe</strong>™</h2>
<p><strong>Lupe</strong>™ is an Ancient Mexican Skeleton created on Aztec, Mayan and other Ancient Mexican Cultures. The aim of Lupe™ is to show the world from an Ancient Mexican perspective, where death was not seen as a bad event. They saw it as the next step of our existence, as a perpetuation and not the end. </p>
<p>There is nothing like Lupe™; it is an original and astonishing concept that hasn't previously been used. Because of this, Lupe™ is the first Ancient Mexican character in history.</p>
<p>Lupe™ is the nickname of Guadalupe, a name used by men and women. This charismatic character could become anyone, both past and present - making us laugh, reliving nostalgic moments, and expressing to us present events as well. The light in the ocular cavities is the reflection of his noble loving soul.</p>

<h2><strong>Investment</strong></h2>
<p>In 2017 Alvgar Group, LLC, obtained the exclusive rights of brands and products of Rock Villa®, Tenoch™ and Lupe™ in the United States of America, by United World Companies.</p>
<p>Alvgar Group invested $ 750,000.00 USD in the creation of the first Rock Villa® restaurant in 2017, as well as in Tenoch™ and Lupe™ products for sale in the restaurant.</p>
<p>In May 2018, Alvgar Group signed with Memorial City Mall in the city of Houston, Texas to open the first Rock Villa® restaurant. Alvgar Group has paid 10 months in advance rent to Memorial City Mall.</p>
<p>In June 2018, architects and engineers were contracted for the realization of the restaurant. Blue prints and papers for the construction permit were submitted in October 2018.</p>
<p>We will start the restaurant construction in February 2019 and open in May 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>Our strategy is to build the first Rock Villa® restaurant, where apart from selling the most nutritious foods in the world, we will also carry the products of Tenoch™, Lupe™ and the souvenirs of Rock Villa®. There will be an area in the restaurant for the sale of t-shirts, caps, stickers, mugs, prints, etc.</p>
<span>Thanks to the Rock Villa® restaurant, we will be able to publicize and sell the products and brands of Lupe™ and Tenoch™, without the need to invest in stores for these brands. Boosting each brand with the products of the others.</span><p> </p>

</div></div>","Rock Villa®
The most nutritious food ounce for ounce on Earth! And the first ULTRA-Nutritious food in the World, expressed in a design, music & art concept, under a flirty & sexy atmosphere.
Rock Villa® (Bee-yeah) rescues the culinary values of an ancient culture, respecting their indigenous ancestor´s recipes and making them available to a clientele wanting new culinary adventures and healthy, nutritious options.
Our proposal is born out of the clash of twelve cultures of extensive history: Aztec, Mayan, Toltec, Zapotec, Mixtec, Tarascan, Teotihuacan, Huastec, Tlaxcaltec, Totonac and Chichimec.
Our dishes are based on a wide range of native stews and meals from Ancient Mexican culture and traditions, where the ingredients used by their ancestors are incorporated, as well as their indigenous cooking techniques.
Rock Villa® is the first company featuring Ancient Mexican Cuisine in the World under Casual Amazing concept. The food served is healthy and ultra-nutritious thanks to the use of Ancient Mexican cooking techniques, ingredients and recipes.
The quality of the food and the preparation techniques used together protect our health, improve our physical condition, and our brain functions.  It also prevents cardiovascular issues, obesity, cell oxidation and degenerative diseases; among others. 
Not only are we gluten free since we don’t use wheat flour of any kind, we are also dairy free.  We do not use cooking oil of any kind, corn syrup, beet sugar, or cane sugar on any food or beverage we prepare and serve, avoiding unneeded empty calories in all our food.



Tenoch™
Tenoch™ Studio is the first design company in the world dedicated to spreading Ancient Mexican cultures, their history, as well as both ancestral and recent Mexican traditions. Its name comes from the first Aztec Emperor ""Tenoch"", a name that means in Nahuatl ""stone cactus fruit"". ""Tenoch"" the Emperor founded the city of Tenochtitlán, which means ""Land of Tenoch"".
Tenoch™ Studio developed the concept of Lupe™ and the image and branding of Rock Villa®, but it also has its own identity, which is reflected in art, design, clothing and accessories, among others. Tenoch™ Studio will continue developing new characters, concepts and unique design lines based on the principle of the transforming force of being.


Lupe™
Lupe™ is an Ancient Mexican Skeleton created on Aztec, Mayan and other Ancient Mexican Cultures. The aim of Lupe™ is to show the world from an Ancient Mexican perspective, where death was not seen as a bad event. They saw it as the next step of our existence, as a perpetuation and not the end. 
There is nothing like Lupe™; it is an original and astonishing concept that hasn't previously been used. Because of this, Lupe™ is the first Ancient Mexican character in history.
Lupe™ is the nickname of Guadalupe, a name used by men and women. This charismatic character could become anyone, both past and present - making us laugh, reliving nostalgic moments, and expressing to us present events as well. The light in the ocular cavities is the reflection of his noble loving soul.


 
Investment
In 2017 Alvgar Group, LLC, obtained the exclusive rights of brands and products of Rock Villa®, Tenoch™ and Lupe™ in the United States of America, by United World Companies.
Alvgar Group invested $ 750,000.00 USD in the creation of the first Rock Villa® restaurant in 2017, as well as in Tenoch™ and Lupe™ products for sale in the restaurant.

We will start the restaurant construction in February 2019 and open in May 2019.
 
Strategy
Our strategy is to build the first Rock Villa® restaurant, where apart from selling the most nutritious foods in the world, we will also carry the products of Tenoch™, Lupe™ and the souvenirs of Rock Villa®. There will be an area in the restaurant for the sale of t-shirts, caps, stickers, mugs, prints, etc.
Thanks to the Rock Villa® restaurant, we will be able to publicize and sell the products and brands of Lupe™ and Tenoch™, without the need to invest in stores for these brands. Boosting each brand with the products of the others.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is another project of ""Bosanet LLC"" <a href=""http://www.bosanet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bosanet.com</a>
</li>
<li>We strive to offer the less fortunate and the people who can not or choose to not consume regular food and alternative to receive all the nutrients they need for a reasonable price.</li>
<li>We have created a product, based on products offered by governments in countries with a high hunger index. This product contains 10 vitamins and 4 minerals.</li>
<li>A 200 gram package, with an average price of US$ 3.0/unit, provides 20 meals. I mean, a meal would be priced at 15 cents.</li>
<li>For every 3 product sold in the USA, we will give away 1 to a country with a high level of poverty and mal nutrition.</li>
<li>We have adapted it to the American market, as a ready to drink product, to turn it into a fundamental product for the times of financial crisis that we will be facing.</li>
<li>Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of health. Healthy people are stronger, more productive and want to develop their abilities to the fullest.</li>
<li>With your support, we will be supplying the population in the United States with the best nutritional product available to everyone.</li>
<li>Our experience has been working in the USA for 16 years, supporting product and service entrepreneurs from Latin America, to introduce products to the North American market.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking for U$350,000 for the development of the project.</li>
<li>Currently we have developed the formulas, we have registered the brand ""Nutreya!"" in several countries of the world, including USA, we have FDA approval, and we already have the real product.</li>
<li>We already have the distribution program for the American Market.</li>
<li>We already have experience in selling the product in another presentation for other types of markets.</li>
<li>With the investment: we will make the first imports for the Florida and New York markets, we will structure the operation in the USA and the marketing strategy for the socialization of the product.</li>
<li>Interest: we recognize 15% annually, with interest paid quarterly.</li>
<li>Capital: will be paid in 12 months.</li>
<li>What happens if we do not reach the goal: We need a minimum of US $ 150,000 to start the operation. If we don't reach $ 350K, we start with less volume of product.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently there is a product in the USA that works for nutritional issues and sick people.</li>
<li>Nutreya!, is a better solution for its composition of vitamins and minerals, but with a price to the public, 50% of the closest competitor.</li>
<li>With this product, we will be supporting people living in the USA, to maintain a good level of their nutrition at a reasonable price.</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary

This is another project of ""Bosanet LLC"" www.bosanet.com

We strive to offer the less fortunate and the people who can not or choose to not consume regular food and alternative to receive all the nutrients they need for a reasonable price.
We have created a product, based on products offered by governments in countries with a high hunger index. This product contains 10 vitamins and 4 minerals.
A 200 gram package, with an average price of US$ 3.0/unit, provides 20 meals. I mean, a meal would be priced at 15 cents.
For every 3 product sold in the USA, we will give away 1 to a country with a high level of poverty and mal nutrition.
We have adapted it to the American market, as a ready to drink product, to turn it into a fundamental product for the times of financial crisis that we will be facing.
Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of health. Healthy people are stronger, more productive and want to develop their abilities to the fullest.
With your support, we will be supplying the population in the United States with the best nutritional product available to everyone.
Our experience has been working in the USA for 16 years, supporting product and service entrepreneurs from Latin America, to introduce products to the North American market.


What We Need & What You Get

We are looking for U$350,000 for the development of the project.
Currently we have developed the formulas, we have registered the brand ""Nutreya!"" in several countries of the world, including USA, we have FDA approval, and we already have the real product.
We already have the distribution program for the American Market.
We already have experience in selling the product in another presentation for other types of markets.
With the investment: we will make the first imports for the Florida and New York markets, we will structure the operation in the USA and the marketing strategy for the socialization of the product.
Interest: we recognize 15% annually, with interest paid quarterly.
Capital: will be paid in 12 months.
What happens if we do not reach the goal: We need a minimum of US $ 150,000 to start the operation. If we don't reach $ 350K, we start with less volume of product.


The Impact

Currently there is a product in the USA that works for nutritional issues and sick people.
Nutreya!, is a better solution for its composition of vitamins and minerals, but with a price to the public, 50% of the closest competitor.
With this product, we will be supporting people living in the USA, to maintain a good level of their nutrition at a reasonable price.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Based in metro Detroit, The Vegan Marshmallow Co. creates natural, handmade marshmallows in an exciting collection of imaginative flavors. Our marshmallows contain only fresh, natural ingredients and are soy, corn, and carrageenan free. Any color or texture you experience also comes from natural ingredients.</p>
<p>We have been creating amazing confections for quite a few years. When several of our family members began transitioning to a vegetarian, then vegan diet, we found ourselves having to make some significant modifications to our recipes for marshmallows, truffles, cakes and cookies to accomodate their new lifestyles. Realizing that there are so few vegan marshmallow options we set out to create the best vegan marshmallows in the same amazing flavors which are available to non vegans. After SOOO many tries, we have FINALLY come up with a formula that, not only tastes great, but is the closest texture to a traditional marshmallow while still being gelatin, corn, soy and carrageenan free. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521689059/xpedcz20qqa6qgnff7sq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are off to a pretty good start with our designs, formula, and website done. We have even secured a small workspace where we can build a kitchen with dedicated equipment for vegan production. With YOUR support, we can purchase equipment, ingredients, and packaging and start our first major production run so we can get our sweets to fluff lovers across the US.</p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the challenges that arise in our endeavor are related around the fact that meads and country wines are not readily available or provided by most retailers. This has resulted in a substantial lack of information around what they are and what they taste like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the process of brewing and tasting our own beverages we've been able to see what works and what doesn't. This has also led us to giving away our tester batches to everyone we legally can, helping us align our product with a more generalized palate. The knowledge of what these drinks are has been spreading to more people through our efforts and this has allowed us to slowly garner a base market for once we are in business.</li>
<li>Mead in itself has been seen as a uncategorized drink, it is neither a beer or wine. (However depending on who you ask you may receive a different response.) This results in a varied perspective towards the drink. Some may avoid it because it is not a ""beer,"" others may also avoid it because it is not by technical definition a ""wine."" However due to its double sided nature there are those who will jump at the chance to sample a ""honey wine"" or those who enjoy craft brewed drinks may desire to try a lighter, less hoppy drink sweetened with fruit juice, honey, or spices.</li>
<li>Thanks to our connections within the hospitality, rural/country and fantasy/science-fiction community we have seen great interest in the products we plan to offer. These communities are mostly locally based. We will also be reaching out to online markets as well to boost our sales and reach a broader base of clientele in different regions and sectors who want to try something new.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brewing methods are a secondary challenge which we have a keen eye towards optimizing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Country wines are wines made using fruits outside of the grape family, these include but are not limited to: Cherries, Apples, Pumpkins, Blackberries, and Raspberries. The reason we plan to use these types of fruits has a multifaceted response. These fruits can be stored for long periods of time without degradation provided they are refrigerated or frozen (unlike grapes). We will not require a large property to produce our product for the same reason mentioned above. (Grapes must be used right away or a winery will risk going brown and souring the quality.)</li>
<li>These other fruit juices are not sought widely for potential alcohol fermentation leading them to be potentially cheaper than their grape related counterparts.</li>
<li>This can be said for honey as well which can withstand aeons without refrigeration and still be consumable and tasty. This allows us to purchase in bulk and to store this product for an indefinite period of time rendering it cheaper as a source of fermentable material.</li>

<p> </p>
<ul><li>Mead can be made using traditional brewing techniques associated with either wine making or beer making processes. Some of these brewing processes are expensive or unnecessary for the production of mead.</li></ul>
<p>       -Beer requires lots of heat and specialized equipment. (For example you need to crack     your grains prior to boiling the wort to release sugars.)</p>
<p>      -Traditional wines require some specialized equipment as such as fruit presses to process              grapes as quickly as possible to avoid degradation of the fruit.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the purposes of our product we are applying for a commercial winery license which is not allowed to have grain on premises however we will be allowed to have various fruit juices and spices which we will be adding to our meads and wines to give them unique flavours this also means we will be prescribing to the winery method of brewing mead to go along with our country wine additions. As mentioned above, our fruits can be stored for long periods of time and do not require on the site processing, (cutting down on our operating costs.) We will be acquiring our fruit juices from Pacific Coast Fruit Products and storing them within a fridge and freezer to be used when required. Our honey will be purchased in bulk barrels of 285lbs at a charge of 5.65$ a kilogram from Beexcellent Honey.</li>
<li>During our initial proceedings we will be contract brewing with an already established company. This allows us to get the first batch out the door faster, as there will be no need to obtain equipment or facilities of our own as well as utilizing the expertise our contract brewing partner will have in navigating this industry.</li>

<p>Coffee is a fruit. We are used to the roasted seed of that fruit, what we know as coffee today. Cascara, the dried fruit portion of the coffee cherry, was overshadowed by roasted coffee for the last 1,000 years. Ironically, it is <strong>the most nutritious part of coffee</strong>, cascara was forgotten and tossed aside and viewed as a mere byproduct of the coffee drying process. Now, Caskai upcycles cascara into amazing drinks that boost your energy and immune system.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Cascara and Nutrition<br/>— The Untold Story —</h3>
<p>Did you know that 100 grams of cascara (a small handful) has the same amount of Potassium as six bananas? Cascara is the most nutritious part of the coffee and packs quite a punch. Over the centuries, cascara was overshadowed by roasted coffee, and its nutritional benefits were mostly unknown... until now. Cascara contains vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, protein, fatty acids (Omega 3, 6, &amp; 9), and bioactive compounds such as caffeine and polyphenols. Over 1,000 years ago, Oromo warriors and traders, from the area that is now Ethiopia, mashed the entire coffee fruit (cascara and the seed), mixed it with animal fat and used it as food on long journeys away from home.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604086045/h6s5nw3kdlaflgrfjain.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Poly what?</h3>
<p><strong>Polyphenols and Health</strong><br/>Polyphenols are compounds produced by plants that protect the plant from disease and insects. Polyphenols are also greatly beneficial to human health and are being researched for potential anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-diabetic, cardio and neuroprotective, energetic and other properties. Having a diet high in fruits and vegetables whereby you also eat the skin as this is where polyphenols concentrate, is one way to get polyphenols in your diet. Red wine, chocolate, coffee &amp; tea is another. Drinking Caskai is a new way. Caskai contains three classes of polyphenols derived from the cascara and the black elderberry extract used in the drink - flavonoids, phenolic acids, and condensed tannins.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Not all Cascara is the Same</h3>
<p>As founders, we select each lot of cascara we use in Caskai. We only use cascara that meets our strict nutrition and flavor requirements. We are so selective on the cascara we use, we trademarked it <strong>Premium Sun-dried Cascara™.</strong> Our cascara is sourced from fully ripened and hand-picked Arabica coffee grown in the Chriqui highlands of Panama in the shadow of Volcano Baru. We use cascara from what is the called the dry or natural process whereby the whole coffee fruit is sun-dried first, locking in the flavors, and then de-husked. It is the most sustainable form of coffee cherry drying.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">European Black Elderberry</h3>
<p>European Black Elderberry (<i>Sambucus Nigra</i> L.) has been used for centuries as a traditional remedy for colds, flu, and other ailments. Hippocrates, the Greek philosopher known as the ""father of modern medicine"", referred to the Elder tree as his ""medicine chest."" The Elderberries used for the extract we use is produced from a special variety called ""Haschberg"" grown in the foothills and valleys of the Austrian Alps in a region in SE Austria called Styria. The extract is produced to maximize the antioxidants and polyphenols contents. European Black Elderberries are high in a polyphenol called anthocyanins, a flavonoid. Anthocyanins also give the elderberry its purple color.</p>

<h3>Your Support Impacts More than Our Campaign</h3>
<p>First, we could not produce Caskai Cold Brew without your support, particularly considered the current situation and the impact of Covid on startups. So, a big thank you from us, we are eternally grateful. But your support has an impact that goes further...</p>
<p>As our primary ingredient is upcycled, you will also be <strong>supporting a movement to reduce food and agricultural waste</strong> and help the world to see that there are amazing benefits in what we are throwing away. The nutritional story behind cascara is still emerging, but it is amazing the irony of the fact that a byproduct of coffee has health benefits beyond the coffee seed itself. </p>
<p>Finally, your support will create an additional income stream for coffee farmers. We pay our farmers between $1.50 and $3.00/lb for cascara that meets our requirements, not cents per pound like some importers. Coffee farmers have not had it easy. Climate change is reducing yields, commercial coffee prices remain artificially low, and the effects of the current crisis are creating huge issues in the supply chain. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><h2><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h2><p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>My name is <a href=""http://www.selina.se/resume"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Selina Hami</a>, 25, and I’m a food entrepreneur and the founder of the company <a href=""http://www.selina.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Selina’s</a> that creates plant based, innovative food concepts in Sweden.</p><p> </p><p>Since August 2015, I’ve been running the catering <a href=""http://www.selina.se/pome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Selina’s POME Stories </a>(previously Selina’s Organics) where the idea for <a href=""http://www.selina.se/grub"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GRUB</a> came to life. In my catering I focused on plant based Middle Eastern dishes but over time became fascinated with how to create vegan burgers and street food from scratch that everyone can enjoy. I tested my burgers in my catering, my non-vegan as well as vegan customers cheered, I did a happy dance. Now- after having built a concept around this menu- it's time to take the next step: starting the franchise concept GRUB to open the first funky, vegan pub in Stockholm.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE FRANCHISING IDEA</strong></p><p>Since starting my catering, I’ve received requests from customers to open a restaurant and requests from restaurant owners to create a concept for them to run- while at the same time the customer demand and the planet’s need for us to switch to more plant based food is constantly growing.</p><p>Before I went vegan, I loved hanging out at the typical rustic, gourmet burger and steak places in Stockholm. Today, the vegan restaurants available are oriented towards health, raw, or fast food while other restaurants offer vegan options that are marginalized on the menu.</p><p>I have created a rustic franchise pub concept where gourmet, plant based street food is made from scratch with quality produce and served with handicraft beer in a social, inviting environment of live jam session nights, board games and art exhibitions.</p><p>To run a restaurant you need to partner up with others in order to divide the workload and the investments. Being the creator of the brand and having the desire for it to stay on the right track without steering away from the ethical, environmental and culinary ideas that I have carefully created, I have decided to partner up in a way that makes each part independent in their share of the business:</p><p>To run and grow this concept in an effective way, I have chosen to focus on the best of my competencies- concept development, recipe creating, marketing, PR &amp; business strategy- to run a franchise that I can sell to and run together with my partners; the restaurant owners who want to run their own business but need help with a concept to run. This way, I will be able to focus on what I do best to support my partners (the franchisees) while they can focus on what they do best to grow the concept while staying independent with their share of the business- running their own restaurants.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493643162/rvvq9kxfrk2owfulcqdk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2><strong>WHAT I NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></h2><p> </p><p><strong>ABOUT GRUB</strong></p><ul><li><strong>THE PHILOSOPHY</strong></li></ul><p>The aim of GRUB is to offer plant based dishes that are appealing for both vegans and non-vegans in order to normalize plant based foods.</p><p>I have created a concept that reflects customer demands for environmentally sustainable and ethically sourced products, as well as tasty food and a welcoming social environment. In a <a href=""http://www.inizio.se/peak-meat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">survey done by Inizio</a> it was shown that, although 37% of Swedes are striving towards eating less meat, 82% justify eating it because if the good taste. It is time to revolutionize the Swedish restaurant scene to show that plant based foods can be bloody (well, not literally) delicious.</p><p>My food philosophy is not to try to imitate meat or create substitutes for it. Rather, I create dishes that stand on their own and have the core elements that makes a satisfying dish such as umami and consistency.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>THE BURGERS</strong></li></ul><p>What is different about my vegan burgers in comparison is that I prepare them in 4 steps; 1) A slow cooked stew simmers with herbs to draw out the umami, 2) a cereal or flour is added to the stew (e.g. oats, chickpea flour) to create a formable patty, 3) the burger is baked or steamed in an oven, 4) the patties are glazed with a variety of sauces when fried.  </p><p>The burgers I have developed are all made from whole, natural produce such as legumes, oats, mushrooms, and root vegetables. Although the main focus isn’t to be the healthy place, using quality produce and non-fabricated is a crucial part of the concept for it to maintain high quality dishes and develop the culinary skills of the chefs.</p><p>I have created 10 burgers, of which 3-5 will be the signature burgers while the rest, and coming ones, will be a part of the “living menu” where new dishes are created and changed once every week or month. This way, the kitchen staff can work with seasonal produce and be motivated by maintaining high creativity levels in the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Some non-vegan customer comments about the burgers:</p><p>“The burgers were magical”</p><p>“It was sincerely one of the top 3 burgers I’ve ever had, strongly competing for the no. 1 positions!!! And I have lived in the USA, the land of burgers.”</p><p>“Oh. My. God.”</p><p> </p><p>Some customer comments about my catering food:</p><p><br/>""This wasn’t food. This was heaven.”</p><p>“The food was fantastic! You make it with so much love and creativity.”</p><p>""Selina, you did it again. I didn't know vegan food could be so delicious.”</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493643213/fmofndqy4rrurgucrchn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>THE MENU</strong></li></ul><p>The menu is mainly inspired by the south of US and Latin America with burgers and arepas being the signature dishes of the concept.</p><p>Arepas are gluten-free, Latin Americans streetfood- a filled cornbread. I’m currently working on creating a gluten-free burger bread without compensating taste or fluffiness.</p><p>When it comes to beverages, handicraft beers, floats and agua frescas will be available. However, I have chosen to also offer sodas, such a cola drink, from ethical brands.</p><p> </p><p>Except for the burgers, signatures on the menu will be:</p><p>- Arepas</p><p>- Patacones con ají (double fried plantains with cilantro salsa)</p><p>- Monkey bread</p><p>- A range of handicraft beers</p><p>- Floats</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493643189/svmqhriwoo4wupri78yy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>THE PUB</strong></li></ul><p>The atmosphere of the pub is relaxed and inviting with the social activities live jam sessions, board games and art exhibitions of the walls- where there is already a range of Swedish artists waiting to showcase their work.</p><p> </p><p>The interior will have an underground feel and the furnishings will mainly be sourced from second-hand sources for sustainability reasons. This also enables each pub to have its on quirky touch to it depending on what is available.</p><p> </p><p><strong>TO LAUNCH THE CONCEPT</strong></p><p>Up until this point I have built the brand GRUB on my own; creating the recipes, concept development, prototype branding, market positioning, communication, marketing, press. A successful franchise concept needs continuous work where the main task is to enable the pub to live up to its brand.</p><p>Running my own catering and with a background in cafe operational management, and 11 years of employment within the restaurant industry, I know that managing a restaurant is a task that gives little or no time for the overall concept development. The workload must therefore be divided into two managerial roles (also listed in detail further down below):</p><p><i>The franchiser (me):</i> The owner and creator of the brand who runs the concept.</p><p><i>The franchisee:</i> The owner of an individual restaurant who runs the everyday tasks of the business.</p><p>Before I partner up with a franchisee, I need to take the following three last steps that would create the finished, well-packaged and customer requested concept ready to be launched in Sweden:</p><ul><li><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong></li></ul><p><i>Attention! Due to Indiegogo fees, the <a href=""http://www4.skatteverket.se/rattsligvagledning/352535.html?date=2016-01-25#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">unclear regulations of the Swedish Tax Agency regarding crowdfunding </a>and on what perks are considered tax-free, it is difficult to determine beforehand the exact amount that will be recieved. This crowdfunding will be presented to the Tax Agency for an individual analysis to how it should be accounted for. </i></p><ol>
<li>
<u>Creating a franchise contract: 30’000 SEK.</u> I have teamed up with a group of lawyers in Stockholm who are ready to create the franchise contract- which explains the brand in detail and states the responsibilities of the franchiser and franchisee. The contract forms the base of the company as it enables the partnering between me and the restaurant owners.</li>
<li>
<u>Creating a Limited Company (Aktiebolag- AB): 50’000 SEK</u>. As many of you might know, one usually sees the fruits of one’s work in a startup after about 2 years. Although my catering business was profitable within 1,5 years, it still isn’t enough to use as investment. The share capital requirement to open a Limited Company in Sweden is 50’000.</li>
<li>
<u>Refining the branding: 20’000 SEK or more</u>. The rest of the final investment- left after tax determinations from the Swedish Tax Agency (see disclaimer above)- will be used for brand design. Although I have created a concept and prototype branding, it needs to be refined into a proper logo and other digital elements as well as interior design that truly represents the concept and atmosphere of the pub in a coherent way. A good digital design is crucial for communicating the brand effectively and the interior, together with the lighting, sets the right atmosphere. I have already teamed up with a group of designers in Stockholm who specialize in branding food and beverage concept.</li>
</ol><p> </p><ul><li><strong>WHY HAVE I NOT PARTNERED UP WITH A RESTAURANT OWNER ALREADY?</strong></li></ul><p>There are three reasons why I have not yet partnered up with a franchisee:</p><ol>
<li>
<u>Protection of the brand</u>- before presenting and selling in the brand, it must be protected through the franchise contract where the concept will be clearly explained. Furthermore, recipe copying is not unusual within the restaurant business and I have therefore been developing the concept discretely until now.</li>
<li>
<u>Customer demand</u>- usually, franchises are built from an existing restaurant that is then ‘duplicated’. In this case, the concept has not been used in a restaurant which lowers the credibility of the brand since there is no evidence of customer demand or profitable numbers to show. Previous customers’ feedback, this crowdfunding campaign and online feedback is a way to show the demand for this brand to franchisers.</li>
<li>
<u>Incomplete brand</u>- the concept still needs the finishing touch by designers to have a proper, coherent brand that can be presented when searching for partners.</li>
</ol><p> </p><ul><li><strong>WHY CROWDFUNDING?</strong></li></ul><p>I have chosen to use crowdfunding for the following three reasons:</p><ol>
<li>
<u>Control</u>- To be independent as a franchiser enables me run the concept without compromising the fundamental philosophy of the brand, the food style or quality instead of being steered by other partners’ interests. While still running my startup business, I simply don’t have enough to invest in my concept alone.</li>
<li>
<u>Transparency</u>- The crowdfunding engages future customers and becomes a platform for communicating with you at an early stage. This enables me to listen to your ideas and feedback while remaining transparent in my process of building this business so that my intentions and goals of the business are understood by the public.</li>
<li>
<u>Credibility for franchisee</u>- Engaging future customers and getting feedback at this stage is crucial to get more credibility for the future partners to believe in the brand. The crowdfunding therefore serves as a way to fund, but more so as a tool to show the demand for this brand. A loan would not provide this information or publicity.</li>
</ol><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493643305/ws7f6ru3vpbc6x047iws.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>WHO WILL RUN THE RESTAURANT?</strong></p><p>Today, there are two common ways for a restaurant owner to get help with creating their concept and brand:</p><ol>
<li>
<u>Consultants</u> within brand development, menu creating, design or kitchen flow* help restaurant owners in these separate fields. Each one can be hired for a specific project related to their field (e.g. creating the interior design or branding) which then is owned by the restaurant owner when the project is finished. This gives the restaurant owner independence in running the business. However, it can cause a ‘loose’ brand since the concept is something that needs care and attention. This can cause an incoherent concept where the food quality, food style, service, atmosphere, design, don’t live up to the original brand idea and customer expectations.</li>
<li>
<u>A franchise business</u> means that a franchisee pays a licence fee to a franchiser for using an existing and established brand which also already has the kitchen flow* worked out, an established contact with suppliers as well as other thought out systems needed for running the restaurant. This gives the restaurant owner a business that only needs to be run strictly according to the provided instructions. While this is a perfect package for fast food chains, it requires a high starting fee and does not entirely fit the sustainable gourmet brand in mind. The interior design cannot be exactly duplicated since GRUB will focus on second hand, while the creativity in the kitchen will be kept at a high level by professional chefs by having a ‘living’ menu that changes monthly.

SUMMARYBACKGROUNDMy name is Selina Hami, 25, and I’m a food entrepreneur and the founder of the company Selina’s that creates plant based, innovative food concepts in Sweden. Since August 2015, I’ve been running the catering Selina’s POME Stories (previously Selina’s Organics) where the idea for GRUB came to life. In my catering I focused on plant based Middle Eastern dishes but over time became fascinated with how to create vegan burgers and street food from scratch that everyone can enjoy. I tested my burgers in my catering, my non-vegan as well as vegan customers cheered, I did a happy dance. Now- after having built a concept around this menu- it's time to take the next step: starting the franchise concept GRUB to open the first funky, vegan pub in Stockholm. THE FRANCHISING IDEASince starting my catering, I’ve received requests from customers to open a restaurant and requests from restaurant owners to create a concept for them to run- while at the same time the customer demand and the planet’s need for us to switch to more plant based food is constantly growing.Before I went vegan, I loved hanging out at the typical rustic, gourmet burger and steak places in Stockholm. Today, the vegan restaurants available are oriented towards health, raw, or fast food while other restaurants offer vegan options that are marginalized on the menu.I have created a rustic franchise pub concept where gourmet, plant based street food is made from scratch with quality produce and served with handicraft beer in a social, inviting environment of live jam session nights, board games and art exhibitions.To run a restaurant you need to partner up with others in order to divide the workload and the investments. Being the creator of the brand and having the desire for it to stay on the right track without steering away from the ethical, environmental and culinary ideas that I have carefully created, I have decided to partner up in a way that makes each part independent in their share of the business:To run and grow this concept in an effective way, I have chosen to focus on the best of my competencies- concept development, recipe creating, marketing, PR & business strategy- to run a franchise that I can sell to and run together with my partners; the restaurant owners who want to run their own business but need help with a concept to run. This way, I will be able to focus on what I do best to support my partners (the franchisees) while they can focus on what they do best to grow the concept while staying independent with their share of the business- running their own restaurants. WHAT I NEED & WHAT YOU GET ABOUT GRUBTHE PHILOSOPHYThe aim of GRUB is to offer plant based dishes that are appealing for both vegans and non-vegans in order to normalize plant based foods.I have created a concept that reflects customer demands for environmentally sustainable and ethically sourced products, as well as tasty food and a welcoming social environment. In a survey done by Inizio it was shown that, although 37% of Swedes are striving towards eating less meat, 82% justify eating it because if the good taste. It is time to revolutionize the Swedish restaurant scene to show that plant based foods can be bloody (well, not literally) delicious.My food philosophy is not to try to imitate meat or create substitutes for it. Rather, I create dishes that stand on their own and have the core elements that makes a satisfying dish such as umami and consistency. THE BURGERSWhat is different about my vegan burgers in comparison is that I prepare them in 4 steps; 1) A slow cooked stew simmers with herbs to draw out the umami, 2) a cereal or flour is added to the stew (e.g. oats, chickpea flour) to create a formable patty, 3) the burger is baked or steamed in an oven, 4) the patties are glazed with a variety of sauces when fried.  The burgers I have developed are all made from whole, natural produce such as legumes, oats, mushrooms, and root vegetables. Although the main focus isn’t to be the healthy place, using quality produce and non-fabricated is a crucial part of the concept for it to maintain high quality dishes and develop the culinary skills of the chefs.I have created 10 burgers, of which 3-5 will be the signature burgers while the rest, and coming ones, will be a part of the “living menu” where new dishes are created and changed once every week or month. This way, the kitchen staff can work with seasonal produce and be motivated by maintaining high creativity levels in the kitchen. Some non-vegan customer comments about the burgers:“The burgers were magical”“It was sincerely one of the top 3 burgers I’ve ever had, strongly competing for the no. 1 positions!!! And I have lived in the USA, the land of burgers.”“Oh. My. God.” Some customer comments about my catering food:""This wasn’t food. This was heaven.”“The food was fantastic! You make it with so much love and creativity.”""Selina, you did it again. I didn't know vegan food could be so delicious.” THE MENUThe menu is mainly inspired by the south of US and Latin America with burgers and arepas being the signature dishes of the concept.Arepas are gluten-free, Latin Americans streetfood- a filled cornbread. I’m currently working on creating a gluten-free burger bread without compensating taste or fluffiness.When it comes to beverages, handicraft beers, floats and agua frescas will be available. However, I have chosen to also offer sodas, such a cola drink, from ethical brands. Except for the burgers, signatures on the menu will be:- Arepas- Patacones con ají (double fried plantains with cilantro salsa)- Monkey bread- A range of handicraft beers- Floats THE PUBThe atmosphere of the pub is relaxed and inviting with the social activities live jam sessions, board games and art exhibitions of the walls- where there is already a range of Swedish artists waiting to showcase their work. The interior will have an underground feel and the furnishings will mainly be sourced from second-hand sources for sustainability reasons. This also enables each pub to have its on quirky touch to it depending on what is available. TO LAUNCH THE CONCEPTUp until this point I have built the brand GRUB on my own; creating the recipes, concept development, prototype branding, market positioning, communication, marketing, press. A successful franchise concept needs continuous work where the main task is to enable the pub to live up to its brand.Running my own catering and with a background in cafe operational management, and 11 years of employment within the restaurant industry, I know that managing a restaurant is a task that gives little or no time for the overall concept development. The workload must therefore be divided into two managerial roles (also listed in detail further down below):The franchiser (me): The owner and creator of the brand who runs the concept.The franchisee: The owner of an individual restaurant who runs the everyday tasks of the business.Before I partner up with a franchisee, I need to take the following three last steps that would create the finished, well-packaged and customer requested concept ready to be launched in Sweden:WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?Attention! Due to Indiegogo fees, the unclear regulations of the Swedish Tax Agency regarding crowdfunding and on what perks are considered tax-free, it is difficult to determine beforehand the exact amount that will be recieved. This crowdfunding will be presented to the Tax Agency for an individual analysis to how it should be accounted for. 

Creating a franchise contract: 30’000 SEK. I have teamed up with a group of lawyers in Stockholm who are ready to create the franchise contract- which explains the brand in detail and states the responsibilities of the franchiser and franchisee. The contract forms the base of the company as it enables the partnering between me and the restaurant owners.

Creating a Limited Company (Aktiebolag- AB): 50’000 SEK. As many of you might know, one usually sees the fruits of one’s work in a startup after about 2 years. Although my catering business was profitable within 1,5 years, it still isn’t enough to use as investment. The share capital requirement to open a Limited Company in Sweden is 50’000.

Refining the branding: 20’000 SEK or more. The rest of the final investment- left after tax determinations from the Swedish Tax Agency (see disclaimer above)- will be used for brand design. Although I have created a concept and prototype branding, it needs to be refined into a proper logo and other digital elements as well as interior design that truly represents the concept and atmosphere of the pub in a coherent way. A good digital design is crucial for communicating the brand effectively and the interior, together with the lighting, sets the right atmosphere. I have already teamed up with a group of designers in Stockholm who specialize in branding food and beverage concept.
 WHY HAVE I NOT PARTNERED UP WITH A RESTAURANT OWNER ALREADY?There are three reasons why I have not yet partnered up with a franchisee:

Protection of the brand- before presenting and selling in the brand, it must be protected through the franchise contract where the concept will be clearly explained. Furthermore, recipe copying is not unusual within the restaurant business and I have therefore been developing the concept discretely until now.

Customer demand- usually, franchises are built from an existing restaurant that is then ‘duplicated’. In this case, the concept has not been used in a restaurant which lowers the credibility of the brand since there is no evidence of customer demand or profitable numbers to show. Previous customers’ feedback, this crowdfunding campaign and online feedback is a way to show the demand for this brand to franchisers.

Incomplete brand- the concept still needs the finishing touch by designers to have a proper, coherent brand that can be presented when searching for partners.
 WHY CROWDFUNDING?I have chosen to use crowdfunding for the following three reasons:

Control- To be independent as a franchiser enables me run the concept without compromising the fundamental philosophy of the brand, the food style or quality instead of being steered by other partners’ interests. While still running my startup business, I simply don’t have enough to invest in my concept alone.

Transparency- The crowdfunding engages future customers and becomes a platform for communicating with you at an early stage. This enables me to listen to your ideas and feedback while remaining transparent in my process of building this business so that my intentions and goals of the business are understood by the public.

Credibility for franchisee- Engaging future customers and getting feedback at this stage is crucial to get more credibility for the future partners to believe in the brand. The crowdfunding therefore serves as a way to fund, but more so as a tool to show the demand for this brand. A loan would not provide this information or publicity.
 WHO WILL RUN THE RESTAURANT?Today, there are two common ways for a restaurant owner to get help with creating their concept and brand:

Consultants within brand development, menu creating, design or kitchen flow* help restaurant owners in these separate fields. Each one can be hired for a specific project related to their field (e.g. creating the interior design or branding) which then is owned by the restaurant owner when the project is finished. This gives the restaurant owner independence in running the business. However, it can cause a ‘loose’ brand since the concept is something that needs care and attention. This can cause an incoherent concept where the food quality, food style, service, atmosphere, design, don’t live up to the original brand idea and customer expectations.

A franchise business means that a franchisee pays a licence fee to a franchiser for using an existing and established brand which also already has the kitchen flow* worked out, an established contact with suppliers as well as other thought out systems needed for running the restaurant. This gives the restaurant owner a business that only needs to be run strictly according to the provided instructions. While this is a perfect package for fast food chains, it requires a high starting fee and does not entirely fit the sustainable gourmet brand in mind. The interior design cannot be exactly duplicated since GRUB will focus on second hand, while the creativity in the kitchen will be kept at a high level by professional chefs by having a ‘living’ menu that changes monthly. My franchise will provide a smaller package, listed down below, and thus a smaller entry fee.  
The idea is therefore to create the brand GRUB that customers back up to show their interest. The restaurant will be run by a partner which the competencies listed below as well as the services I will provide for the entry and monthly fee.* Kitchen flow= the term for the routines created for a kitchen for a working flow of service, cleaning, storage, food preparation and cooking.RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPETENCIES OF SELINA HAMII have run and managed cafés as well as created and run my own business. All after working in the restaurant industry for 11 years. By creating this concept, the franchisees are provided the main services listed below (the details are presented in the contract with the franchisee) for an entrance fee and a fixed monthly fee.- A developed package of an external brand with recipes, market positioning, logo, web design, interior design and more.- An established customer demand and smaller existing customer base.- Continuous consulting regarding the external and internal brand.- Continuous marketing for brand- Continuous establishment and development of the brand- Established contact with suppliers- Training of the brand, cooking, recipes, food philosophy for management staff- Since this franchise has not been tested as a physical restaurant, it lacks an established kitchen flow or recorded success rates and will therefore have lower fees than an established franchise.- The fees for the first franchise restaurant will be lower than the future ones since the kitchen flow, success rates and internal brand will be fully developed in the first location. RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPETENCIES OF THE FRANCHISEESThe franchising contract is the base of the company and will be signed by all parties involved. The will clearly state the responsibility of the parties, where the franchisee’s include:- Paying an entry fee and a monthly fee for the licence to use the brand and the services provided by GRUB.- Owning and running the physical restaurant, which means paying for any fees involved such as suppliers, employers, administration fees, furnishing, etc.- The location will be picked out together with Selina Hami.Are you interested in becoming the first partner and franchisee of GRUB?

A second restaurant would be opened in another location in Stockholm to further build the routines and the concept while enabling the two franchisees to communicate and cooperate.

Cassinelli's was Rated The best restaurant in Clay County by AL.com

What We Need & What You Get
Opening a restaurant is not easy! Fortunately, I have this covered. Keeping it going takes your support. I'm looking for at least 100 of my loyal customers to commit to a Four-Month Community Membership in Cassinelli's. Show your support for Small Businesses. #SHOPLOCAL
Membership is on a month to month basis and only costs $25.00 per month. Membership starts on the day you join and entitles the member to a 25% discount on all purchases for food and drink for you the member and one guest. This 25% discount is good for dine-in or take-out.The average meal costs about $12.00 but members get that same meal for $9.00 a savings of $3.00 and if you dine with a friend the saving doubles to $6.00. What that means is if you dine-in or take-out for two people just once a week you have covered $24.00 of your $25.00 membership fee. You can start and stop your membership anytime you want.

Cassinelli's is looking for 100+ people to commit to a Four-Month Membership ($100.00).
Get a 25% discount on all food and drink purchases for you the member and one guest.

<p>Das Projekt:</p>
<p>Wir haben eine großartige Eventlocation im Taunus nahe Frankfurt: eine alte Fabrikhalle aus dem 19.Jahrhundert welche bereits eine Restauration beinhaltet und als besondere Attraktion einen kleinen Indoor-Hochseilgarten über den Restauranttischen. Ferner gibt es eine Indoor-Kletterwand, einen kleinen Boulderbereich für Kinder in dem diese sich auf weiche Matratzen fallen lassen können und einen großen Outdoor Hochseilgarten, nur 10 Minuten zu Fuß entfernt. Angeschlossen ist ein Eventbüro, in dem man Veranstaltungen für Gruppen mit sportlichen Aktivitäten, Kletteraktionen, Floß-Bau an nahegelegenen Teichen als Gruppenaktivität oder auch als Team-Building-Maßnahme buchen kann. Wir möchten nun die Restauration, welche derzeit fast nicht betrieben wird, ausbauen und dazu noch eine feine Brauerei installieren. Diese soll nicht nur für Aktivitäten wie „selber Bier-brauen“ genutzt werden, sondern das tolle Naherholungsangebot erweitern und zwar mit Braukursen. Der Erholungswert des frisch und klassisch gebrauten traditionellen Bieres, welches nicht mit Zutaten gepanscht wird (die explizit im sogenannten „Deutschen Reinheitsgebot“ nicht genannt werden, aber gerne auch von großen Brauereien genutzt werden, oder die zum sogenannten Craft-Bier-Wahn gehören), ist besonders. Die Spielwiese der Geschmäcker, die man aus den vier Grundzutaten Wasser, Malz, Hopfen und Hefe zaubern kann, ist gewaltig und mehr braucht es auch nicht! Wir haben in den letzten drei Jahren Bierrezepte entwickelt, die dem Genießer ein Schnalzen entlocken und den ursprünglichen Biergenuss, der in unseren Breiten nicht mehr so leicht anzutreffen ist, hochhält. Es soll die höchste Brauereianlage Hessens werden (ca 600m ü.NN, laut aktuellem Kenntnisstand gibt es keine höhere Brauerei in Hessen) und auch in ausgewählten Hotels und Restaurants (es gibt bereits Vorbestellungen!) erhältlich sein. Für den heimischen Genuss werden wir auch Flaschen abfüllen und an ausgewählte Restaurants und Hotels in und um Frankfurt vertreiben. Ziel ist jedoch eine überschaubare Größe, machbar in unserer besonderen Location.</p>
<p>Auch soll dieses wunderschöne Restaurant mit großer Kapazität für Livekonzerte und große Get-together genutzt werden. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wer sind wir: Wir sind ein drei Mann starkes Team.</p>
<p>Dazu gehört Simon, ausgebildeter Glaser und Einzelhandelskaufmann, zudem ehemaliger Lehramtsstudent für Englisch sowie Politik und Wirtschaft, der sich seit drei Jahren intensiv  mit der Thematik des Bierbrauens, welches uns alle drei die letzten Jahre stark beschäftigt und motiviert, befasst hat. Simon ist unser Bierbrauer und wird das flüssige Gold herstellen.</p>
<p>Dann ist da Felix, gelernter Koch und kreativer Geist in allen gastronomischen Belangen. Derzeit als Geschäftsführer und Mädchen für alles in einem bekannten Frankfurter Cateringunternehmen beschäftigt, wird er sich der kulinarischen Anforderungen der Gäste der Events und des Restaurants annehmen und diese mit einer anspruchsvoll bodenständigen und extrem leckeren Küche, natürlich auch passend zum Bier, verwöhnen.</p>
<p>Der dritte im Bunde ist Jan, Rechtsanwalt, LL.M. und diplomiert von einer renomierten Schweizer  Hotelfachschule, zuhause in der Gastronomie,  bereits seit 23 Jahren sowohl im Service als auch der Küche tätig, letztens noch in einem 2* Michelin Restaurant.</p>

<p>Was wollen wir von Euch:</p>
<p>Von Euch wollen wir Lust auf coole Events, einzigartiges handgebrautes Bier aus der Gegend und verdammt leckeres Essen. Lust darauf das Angebot im Taunus, dem Einzugsgebiet Frankfurts um eine großartige Möglichkeit zu erweitern und den durstigen Feldbergwanderern, Radlern und Bikern eine tolle Einkehrmöglichkeit zu bieten, wo sie sich von den wunderschönen und anstrengenden Touren in gepflegter Atmosphäre erholen können. Wenn ihr eben darauf Lust habt, unterstützt uns finanziell, damit wir unser Vorhaben rasch verwirklichen können!</p>
<p>Eure Hilfe soll aber natürlich auch eine Gegenleistung erhalten!</p>
<p> Wenn Ihr es uns ermöglicht diese Brauerei zu eröffnen (der Gesamtkapitalbedarf liegt bei über einer halben Million Euro, mit eurem Zutun können wir aber starten), werdet Ihr für Eure vorgreifliche Unterstützung mit dem herrlichen Göttertrunk belohnt. Unseren Dank für euren Vertrauensvorschuss könnt Ihr auf der Unterstützungsseite mit den Beträgen ersehen.

<h2><strong>Help Us Launch Our New Colors!!</strong></h2>
<p>In December of 2019 we launched the original <strong>DraftBottle,</strong> our Steel-Blue model that you see in our video. After our launch, we've had great success selling <strong>DraftBottle</strong> on our website, at beer fests, to local breweries (even national craft breweries like Shipyard!) and local/regional retail. <strong>DraftBottle</strong> has gained traction as more and more people are looking for new and fun ways to enjoy their favorite drinks outside of traditional settings. Along with that success comes challenges and also product suggestions/expansion.</p>
<p>Two of the suggestions were producing more colors and adding a silicone bottom for slip and scratch protection. We went to our manufacturer in January 2020 and added our two new models<strong> Brushed</strong> <strong>Stainless Steel</strong> and <strong>Gunpowder Black!</strong> Also, we have added a silicone bottom to help with slip and scratch protection.</p>
<h2>Ugh...2020!</h2>
<p>We all know what happened next, the world changed in March 2020 and our production was delayed for over six months. <u><i><strong>We were able to obtain a small amount of our new colors with the silicone bottoms in late 2020 for the holiday season. But, now we need your help with producing our full production run!</strong></i></u></p>
<p>In exchange for your gracious consideration, we are offering you the chance to order our new colors of <strong>DraftBottle</strong> at a discount, normally $24.99, now $15 for <strong><i>Earlybird backers </i></strong>(that's 40% off)! The funds raised will go directly to the production of the new colors, retail boxes and some marketing. </p>
<p><strong>The best thing: </strong>We have everything set for production! Once funding piece has been solidified, we will have the bottles produced and shipped<strong> to you by late March, early April 2021,</strong> just in time for the Spring/Summer!</p>

<p><strong>DraftBottle</strong> is a new beverage tumbler which unscrews below the neck allowing you to easily fill it with 22oz of draft beer, mixed drinks, iced coffee, water, glass bottled beer, beer from a growler, or any other beverage!  It’s made from 18/8 food grade stainless steel, and the base cup is  double walled and vacuum sealed to keep your brew cold! The reusable cap helps to stop spills and prevent unwanted debris from getting in. The  exterior is powder coated to help durability, it’s sweat-proof, has a leak-proof seal around the separation and a silicone bottom for slip and scratch protection. <strong>DraftBottle</strong> is Eco-friendly,  BPA free and is <strong>dishwasher-safe and super easy to clean</strong>!</p>

<h2><strong>The DraftBottle Story</strong></h2>
<p>Like most  inventions or ideas, they are born out of a need to help solve a  problem, and if it involves beer (or jack 'n coke), you better believe I will be motivated  to solve it! So, what is that problem? How do you enjoy your draft beer/glass beer or other beverages in places where do don’t want plastic cups/glass bottles but you still want the feel of holding a classic beer bottle? – That is where <strong>DraftBottle</strong> comes in! A  few years ago I was getting ready to do some yard work and I wanted to  enjoy the beer I had on tap in my kegerator. There were a few problems,  the plastic cups are too open, and grass and bugs fall into it, it gets warm, it spills easily, etc etc etc. Then I thought, why isn’t there a  beer bottle that opens below the neck so I can fill it up with draft  beer?? <strong>DraftBottle</strong> was born! What you see below is what I scribbled down on a piece of paper to remember my idea. What you can also see, is those years of art school, really paid off....lol! I sent that masterpiece to a friend who is a patent attorney and the journey began!</p>

<h1>Design Patent Approval</h1>
<p>In March of 2019 we were informed that our 2 design patents for a screw and snap  together convertible container were approved, we immediately went to work finding a manufacturer and began the process of making production molds and putting together a launch budget.   We were initially going to run a crowd-funding campaign, but decided to fund the first run of <strong>Steel Blue DraftBottles</strong> internally and get them out to market as quickly as possible. By the time our patents were issued in June of 2019, we had begun production on samples, had our 1st production run scheduled and our launch date set.</p>
<h1>Uses? - Unlimited!</h1>
<p><strong> DraftBottle</strong> has unlimited uses, which include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily fill draft beer from a tap/kegerator</li>
<li>
<u>Perfect for around the pool/beach/boat</u>, or any non-glass areas</li>
<li>Fun and easy for tailgating &amp; the golf course</li>
<li>Use around the house when you don’t want a drink to spill</li>
<li>Craft Brew Promo Item/”Go-Cup”</li>
<li>Great as a water-bottle as well, easily add ice to a drink</li>
<li>Easy to clean, so great for shakes and other beverages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks of this project are low, we have already worked with the manufacturer to produce our first color model and small batch of the new colors, so the mold is already ""in-house"" and we have built a great working relationship with them over the past year.

<h3><strong>Shipping Details</strong></h3>
<p>We are glad to be able to provide people all around the world with IRISgo reusable cups, with shipping available to more than 150 countries worldwide. Depending on your country, you may be responsible for paying duty, taxes, or other applicable fees before you can receive your package. These policies are set locally, so please check with the relevant sources where you live for the most accurate information.</p>
<p>As we provide worldwide shipping, it is impossible for us to cover all potential local charges. The prices are therefore for the product without additional costs such as customs duties and possible taxes. We give everything so that you can enjoy your drinks asap from an IRISgo.</p>
<p>We are working closely with our manufacturing partner to ensure that every single IRISgo cup meets our quality standards. In the unlikely event of a manufacturing defect, we will be more than happy to replace the unit. Please note, we cannot offer returns or refunds for any other reasons. In the event that you do have a defect or other concern about your order, please email us at support@conceptiris.ch.</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We have been working on the IRISgo Cup for over three years now, which means that many of the initial challenges are behind us. As we developed an innovative- closure system and unique design, we went through a long and complex prototyping period. By working with the Institute of Innovation and Technology at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, we were able to test our product in numerous important tests, such as durability tests with the closure system and so on. We also spent a lot of effort into the supplier selection to find the partner who meets all our criterias. Together with our selected manufacturer, the final development steps were completed so that today we can present a product ready for mass production. Numerous rounds of prototypes were rigorously tested in a variety of materials to perfect the IRISgo. Everything up to this point has already been paid for, thereby minimizing the risk of unexpected manufacturing costs or hidden delays. We do everything we can to ensure that the IRISgo cups can be delivered as soon as possible. The goal is to deliver the IRISgo cups before 31.03.2021. However, as we are bound to external processes that can't be influenced by us, this delivery time cannot be guaranteed. The worldwide Covid-19 pandemic makes it additionally difficult to estimate a precise delivery time. We are doing everything possible to ensure that you will soon be able to enjoy your drinks out of an IRISgo cup. To ensure that our project runs as smoothly as possible, we draw on expert knowledge in the different project phases. Our network includes experienced industrial designers, business engineers, internationally active manufacturers, and experienced entrepreneurs. Besides, we can count on entrepreneurial support from established foundations and start-up organizations with whom we are in constant contacts, such as the Gebert Rüf Stiftung, Venture Kick, Innovation Transfer Central Switzerland, Smartup, Zünder, and Swiss Innovation Challenge. Of course, there are always obstacles on the way until all IRISgo cups are in the post box of every single supporter, but on our already very long journey we have proven that we can handle various obstacles.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Commitment to environmental protection</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Durable design</h3>
<p>The IRISgo is manufactured with durable and reliable materials, in combination with our unique design we aim to provide a highly ergonomic and user-friendly product. The product has been tested for durability with the help of permanent test benches and robots at the Institute of Innovation and Technology at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. We place a high value on the sustainability of our product.</p>
<h3>Reuse and recyclability</h3>
<p>When the product has reached its lifetime, we offer our customers to return the IRISgo cup to us. We disassemble the cup and then we will recycle the individual parts. As we are following the cradle to cradle approach, we selected our suppliers to ensure that all the parts can be recycled. We have also racked our brains over the packaging concept. In our opinion, it is a thorn that the packaging of a large number of products is oversized and only serves the pure purpose of packaging. When choosing our packaging, we tried to design a minimalistic packaging made of sustainable and recyclable materials that can further be used as a storage box or pen holder and is not just a disposable paper tube.</p>
<h3>Sustainable materials</h3>
<p>IRISgo is made primarily from stainless steel, which is durable and highly resistant to staining, corrosion, and other forms of wear. The non-metal parts of the IRISgo are made of recycled polypropylene, also a very durable material. The third component is silicone which is also a durable material and can be recycled after the lifetime of the product.</p>
<h3>Environmentally friendly production </h3>
<p>Our product will be Swiss-Made certified. Swiss companies are obliged to undergo strict environmental controls. Furthermore, we compensate for our total carbon emissions. IRISgo is 100% carbon neutral.</p>
<h3>Sustainable Distribution</h3>
<p>We also compensate for emissions caused by the distribution of the IRISgo cups.</p>
<h3>Something else</h3>
<p>Our goal is to achieve a positive impact on the environment with our product. In our opinion, the enormous use of disposable products such as one-way cups is a huge social and environmental problem. Our way to lead society away from the use of these disposable cups is to transform reusable cups into a hyped product which is nice to have and enables perfect drinking enjoyment anytime, anywhere. That is exactly what we want to achieve with the IRISgo. IRISgo convinces with its design, branding, user-friendliness and solves the problems of existing reusable cups. This encourages consumers worldwide to use reusable products more often.</p>

As we are following the cradle to cradle approach, we selected our suppliers to ensure that all the parts can be recycled. We have also racked our brains over the packaging concept. In our opinion, it is a thorn that the packaging of a large number of products is oversized and only serves the pure purpose of packaging. When choosing our packaging, we tried to design a minimalistic packaging made of sustainable and recyclable materials that can further be used as a storage box or pen holder and is not just a disposable paper tube.
Sustainable materials
IRISgo is made primarily from stainless steel, which is durable and highly resistant to staining, corrosion, and other forms of wear. The non-metal parts of the IRISgo are made of recycled polypropylene, also a very durable material. The third component is silicone which is also a durable material and can be recycled after the lifetime of the product.
Environmentally friendly production 
Our product will be Swiss-Made certified. Swiss companies are obliged to undergo strict environmental controls. Furthermore, we compensate for our total carbon emissions. IRISgo is 100% carbon neutral.
Sustainable Distribution
We also compensate for emissions caused by the distribution of the IRISgo cups.
Something else
Our goal is to achieve a positive impact on the environment with our product. In our opinion, the enormous use of disposable products such as one-way cups is a huge social and environmental problem. Our way to lead society away from the use of these disposable cups is to transform reusable cups into a hyped product which is nice to have and enables perfect drinking enjoyment anytime, anywhere. That is exactly what we want to achieve with the IRISgo. IRISgo convinces with its design, branding, user-friendliness and solves the problems of existing reusable cups. This encourages consumers worldwide to use reusable products more often.",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Norwalk Brew House (NBH) is a beer company dedicated to leveraging our products, our influence and our brand to give back to the greater community.  From production, to distribution, to brand incubation; the goal is to create an ecosystem of like-minded Latino/POC owned beer companies.  This will allow us to create jobs, build ownership, equity and diversity in an industry where less than 1% of  beer businesses are owned by Latinos. </p>
<p>Our long term plan is ambitious, but it's not impossible and we believe we can achieve it! </p>
<p>Step one is to properly launch our fan favorite, ""<strong>Bidi Bidi Blonde Blonde</strong>"" - A refreshingly crisp Mexican American blonde ale.  This will be the beer that starts it all and you can proudly say, ""I helped make the dream a reality,"" while you drink the best blonde out there!  </p>

<p align=""left"">In 2015, Ray cofounded the largest Latino homebrew club in the country – <strong>SoCal Cerveceros </strong>(SCC).

<p align=""left"">It was at a sold-out <i>Coldxela</i> 2019 when Ray realized a beer company is like a record label.  He can source up and coming brewers like musical talent.  He could develop and market beer brands the way he developed and distributed  music for artists.  Inspired by this idea, Ray set out to create something new - and that's how Norwalk Brew House was born. </p>
