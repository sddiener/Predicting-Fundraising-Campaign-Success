<p>Grace City is a  congregation located in Northeast Philadelphia with a consistent vision of the renewing power of the Gospel. </p>
<p>Jesus says in the gospel of Matthew that his people collectively are like a city.</p>
<p>“You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.” Matthew 5:16</p>
<p>The reason this city cannot be hidden is because it’s on a hill and it’s full of light. You can’t hide light. It’s just there. It shines. Revealing. Protecting. Warming. Like the telephone pole lights that line our city blocks—God’s people are a city that illuminates the world.</p>
<p>Jesus also says that this city of light must let its light shine by doing good works that glorify the Father in heaven.</p>
<p>That’s the vision of Grace City Church. We want to be what Jesus calls us to be—a city within this city, that’s for the city, shining the light of God’s mercy, love, and grace in such a way that God’s fame spreads and the people of this city encounter the renewing power of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Whether you are a committed follower of Jesus, have questions about Jesus, or you’re skeptical about Jesus—we invite you to join us at Grace City and see what God is doing to spread his fame and renew the lives of ordinary people like you &amp; me. Grace City Church of Wissinoming is dedicated to providing a bright future for all of our fellow man. God has blessed us so that we may bless others. </p>

<p>Camp Millbrook's future Centre will be a destination for those seeking information on medicinal plants, a place for visitors to discover their ancestral connection to Jamaica and a wellness destination for retreats. The Centre will be located in the heart of Jamaica's history of emancipation from slavery.</p>
<p>Primary focus of this campaign is to establish an infrastructure to house a Centre that will include space for research teams, visitor information on the history of the area and a wellness destination for retreat participants. Ultimately the research conducted here will lead to the crafting of nutraceuticals for commercial distribution as well as ancestral mapping for those seeking information about the links to Jamaica. Employment opportunities will assist an entire community who currently live a marginal lifestyle and many young people leave their homes in search of work in the cities. The Centre will employ not only tour guides and facilitators but also the local farmers.</p>
<p>Richard Wright, the driving force of this project, began his dream at the age of 9. He was born in the Tangle River area and dreamt of how to create a sustainable economy for local farmers and how to heal people mind, body and spirit. He went to St Lawrence University in New York, worked in the mental health field and then became an entrepreneur owning a private health care service company. His return to Jamaica 12 years ago began the journey of manifesting his dreams to reality. Richard's education and entrepreneurial skills blend to move this dream ahead. A project of this scale requires more than one determined man ...it requires a community.... it requires YOU! Richard has been networking and interested parties are ready to commit, only after the Centre is built though.</p>
<p>Investors will be rewarded not only in their contribution to a community economic strategy but if you donate $500 or more you can stay at Millbrook's resort at a discount of...book 5 days and pay for only 3 and enjoy an extended tour of Camp Millbrook's. <a href=""http://milbrooksresortmontegobay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://milbrooksresortmontegobay.com/</a> Donations of $100 would include naming your favourite animal on the property. Each contributor of $10 or more will have their name on a plaque at the Centre honouring your support.</p>
<p>This campaign is phase 2 of a long term vision. Phase 1 included the purchase of an area of 300 acres that include clearing a meadow area, building a basic bunk house, toilet and parking area. Trails have been cleared to safely move through the mountainous jungle where study of unique geological formations can be viewed and access to the caves are the jewels at the end of the trail. A site has been cleared for the Centre that would house the research building and a rudimentary road has been built. This campaign will fund an environmentally conscious building and a better access road. The building will be a moderate size of approximately 100 x 200 feet, will access the local water source and utilize alternate energy for electricity.</p>
<p>If the target is not fully reached, the first priority of this funding campaign will be improving the road access. In kind and volunteering for construction or marketing support can be discussed with Richard as to the perks dependent on contribution. All monies are for infrastructure improvement on the land.</p>
<p>The site is currently generating limited income as a destination for private tours that showcase Jamaican history. The land is where the Maroons fought battles and found shelter from the English. The trails that have been built to the caves add to the multi purpose long term income potential for historic, geologic and botanical enthusiasts and researchers to take tours and conduct studies.</p>
<p>Phases 3 and 4 will include phase 3 where local farmers will be employed to plant and harvest the medici nal plants for commercial sale to the nutraceutical manufacturers. Phase 4 will include the expansion of technology in the Research section of the Centre and it will showcase the history of the area including a DNA extractor for visitors to trace ancestral links to Jamaica including Afro-Caribbean, the Irish who were amongst the early slaves, the English and other gene pools of Jamaica's past. Phase 5 will be the final goal of treatments for international clients to access the research evidence based treatments. Millbrook's Resort will be connected to Camp Millbrook for those seeking healing through the botanical nutraceuticals and the customized retreats. Retreats will include significant time at the Camp where one's mind, body and spirit can align with ease in an environment such as Camp Millbrook.</p>

<p><strong>Here is what I am trying to do:</strong></p>
<p>I have long been a lover of nature. I’m an avid hiker, trail runner, and lover of our natural world. Currently, I am wrapping up training to become a volunteer hike leader for the San Diego Natural History Museum.</p>
<p>I am a dietitian by trade, and my interest is in nutrition for well-being and healing, along with the psychology of nutrition and behavior change.</p>
<p>I believe that there is a strong connection between nutrition and our connection with nature, and I want to provide a service that combines the two.</p>
<p>My goal is to become a certified forest therapy guide through the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy. </p>
<p>Sure, I could likely develop my own forest therapy program without official training, but in our society of licensing, certifications, and proof of authenticity, I feel that it would be best for me to attend what I have found to be one of the only training programs for this specialty, should the industry grow and one day require me to have the certification.</p>
<p>As this certification is expensive, and requires travel, I am hoping to raise the money to cover tuition and travel expenses for Forest Therapy Guide certification, along with tuition for the required Wilderness First Aid certification. The Forest Therapy Guide certification will consist of a week-long on site intensive training (location determined when I am accepted), followed by 6 months of practicum completed from home, with a mentor and small cohort.</p>
<p>I want to provide an opportunity to connect deeply with nature, from the hour long walk in an open space within the city, to an overnight or weekend retreat in the local mountains. I want to share everything I learn to promote that experience of peace, healing, connection and self-love, among other things. </p>
<p>I think this training will blend well with my expertise in nutrition. I want to make the world a better place. I want to change lives. I think that nutrition and nature is the answer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here are the amazing benefits of spending time in nature:</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that time in the forest lowers salivary levels of cortisol, lowers sympathetic nervous system activity, while increasing parasympathetic activity, lowers blood pressure, lowers heart rate and increases Natural Killer Cells. One study showed a 50% increase in Natural Killer Cells after 3 days in the forest. This increase lasted a month. Natural Killer Cells play a role in fighting cancer and strengthening our immunity.</p>
<p>What does this all mean?</p>
<p>It means that the natural environment can help to manage hypertension, stress, depression, and greatly enhance our immune system.</p>
<p>Phytoncides are compounds emitted by trees, and plants in the forest (and also by some vegetables, fruits, spices, such as the sulfide and allicin in garlic), and have long been used in Eastern medicine. This is one thing that we have teased out of nature that positively affects our health. But there are other things about the natural world that are beneficial to our health, maybe some that aren’t tangible. Take, for instance, one study that links the sight of green forest to shorter hospital stays.</p>
<p>Just as there is a common understanding that the nutrients we receive from food are far superior than what we receive from a pill, nature will never successfully be bottled. There is a symbiotic relationship between us and nature, understandably; we evolved together.</p>
<p>Beyond all the scientific studies, I feel it is just common sense that we understand the importance of our connection to nature.</p>
<p>As cities grow and technology develops, we become more and more disconnected with nature. I am not against this growth and development, as this is also a natural occurrence. But we are not robots. We need life to give us life. That life comes from the food we eat, and the natural world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here is what you will receive if you support me:</strong></p>
<p>I have set up several ""perks"" for donations between $25 - $500. I am eternally grateful for everyone's support. Please see the ""perks"" section for options. </p>
<p>If you are unable to donate, but believe in me and my cause, please share this campaign on your social media, and with all of your networks. I greatly appreciate it!</p>

Phytoncides are compounds emitted by trees, and plants in the forest (and also by some vegetables, fruits, spices, such as the sulfide and allicin in garlic), and have long been used in Eastern medicine. This is one thing that we have teased out of nature that positively affects our health. But there are other things about the natural world that are beneficial to our health, maybe some that aren’t tangible. Take, for instance, one study that links the sight of green forest to shorter hospital stays.
Just as there is a common understanding that the nutrients we receive from food are far superior than what we receive from a pill, nature will never successfully be bottled. There is a symbiotic relationship between us and nature, understandably; we evolved together.
Beyond all the scientific studies, I feel it is just common sense that we understand the importance of our connection to nature.
As cities grow and technology develops, we become more and more disconnected with nature. I am not against this growth and development, as this is also a natural occurrence. But we are not robots. We need life to give us life. That life comes from the food we eat, and the natural world. 
 
Here is what you will receive if you support me:
I have set up several ""perks"" for donations between $25 - $500. I am eternally grateful for everyone's support. Please see the ""perks"" section for options. 
If you are unable to donate, but believe in me and my cause, please share this campaign on your social media, and with all of your networks. I greatly appreciate it!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello There!</h3>
<p>My name is Aaron Eisman and I am the author of <i>""The Evolution of Sports Social Media.""</i> I was born and raised in Los Angeles, where I currently reside. I grew up loving sports and watching various sports on TV with my Dad and Brother. I am a huge Dodgers, Broncos and Clippers fan, as well as a lover of golf. Not to mention, I've traveled to over 20 countries, including lived in Barcelona for 5 months. I am a major foodie and love baking as well.</p>
<h3>Sports Social Media Experience</h3>
<p>After graduating from Indiana University with a Journalism degree, I accepted my first position as a social media editor at Turner Sports. I was part of their first social media team working on accounts like NBA on TNT, NBA TV, March Madness and PGAcom. In late 2015<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, I moved up to New York City to work</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""> for Bleacher Report as a social media programmer. There I got involved with the daily posting to all our main channels, as well as coordinating various departments on social media execution.</span></p>
<p>After my experience ended at B/R, I wanted to move back to LA and accepted a position with the NFL. For the 2018-2019 season, I ran NFL Network's social media channels. It gave me the opportunity to work for one of the top professional leagues in the world. After the season ended in June 2019, I decided to start my own consulting agency, Eisman Digital. I help athletes, sports agencies, startups, technology companies and various other organizations grow their social media channels and following. Feel free to contact me via Aaron@EismanDigital.com for more details! Also, go to <a href=""http://www.EismanDigital.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.EismanDigital.com</a> for my full services.</p>
<p>Over the last year, I interview over 100 people in the sports industry to find out the best stories, secrets and need-to-know information on sports social media. I even give my inside tips on how to grow a following, the strategy you need to be most successful and more! I interviewed people like JaVale McGee, Hunter Pence, Leigh Steinberg (the real Jerry Maguire), Dave Meltzer among others. If you love sports marketing, social media or just sports, than this is the book for you!</p>
<h3>Why I'm Raising Money</h3>
<p>I'm raising money for my book because I incurred over $5,000 of expenses to create the perfect book on sports social media. I spent money in the publishing process including editing, interior formatting, marketing and more. Even the video I created above, wasn't cheap. I am raising money to recoup the fees I incurred to created my first book.</p>
<p>Also, a portion of the money I raise over this campaign will go to the Concern Foundation, a charity dedicated to Cancer Research. My Aunt and Uncle have been associated with the Concern Foundation for a long time.  I am putting money towards this charity because my dad was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer in June. He had to undergo chemotherapy and radiation in July as well as a major surgery to repair his esophagus on September 1st. Currently, he is recovering at the house and making major strides each day.</p>
<p>Please not only give money to my campaign because of recouping the major costs I incurred, but also help me give back to a charity that means a lot to me and my family. </p>
<p>Your support is greatly appreciated!!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>Your support in pre-ordering this book means the world to me, as I’ve paid upfront money to many partners (including Palmetto Publishing) that have helped me create and publish my book.</p>
<p>This pre-order campaign will help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p><strong>Editors</strong> – I’ve worked with a Developmental Editor, who helped enhance the overall style of my writing from the very beginning, chapter-by-chapter; a Copyeditor who read the book line-by-line to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication; and a Proofreader who took one final pass before sending the manuscript off to the printing press!</p>
<p><strong>The Cover Design</strong> – I’ve worked with a cover designer to create my dream book cover! </p>
<p><strong>The Layout Design –</strong> For the interior of my book to fit the correct dimensions of a hardcover, paperback, and ebook.</p>
<p><strong>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts</strong> – I’m working with an incredible PR agency, a digital creator for Instagram/Twitter videos, and more to help get the word out about my book leading up to my publication date this November.</p>
<h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p>I am raising $6,000 in this campaign for two reasons: Help me with the costs I incurred over the last year and help me raise money for the Concern Foundation. The funding will really help me out personally as well as change lives due to the cancer research that is being done by the Concern Foundation to better the world. </p>
<p>Some of the unique perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A softcover, hardcover or ebook version!</li>
<li>A personally signed book with a special note</li>
<li>A 30-minute social media consulting session</li>
<li>A one-hour consulting session or speaker session at your class, conference, etc.</li>
<li><i>Every perk comes with an Esophageal Cancer (Periwinkle) bracelet too!</i></li>
<li>More limited services and gifts!</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach the goal, my funds will still go towards the book and even potentially helping me with the costs of writing my second book! Also, the Concern Foundation would really appreciate any money we can raise for their charity. I still plan to give back as much as I can to help this noble cause.</p>

<h3>Hello, I'm Patrick and I'm back with my second children's book 'A Witch &amp; A Wizard' and would really appreciate your support in raising funds to bring it to life...</h3>
<p>‘A Witch and a Wizard’ is the fantastical tale of a young boy called Tom, whose inquisitive nature gets the better of him, when one night he peeps through his Dad’s telescope and spies the couple next door dancing and chanting around a magnificent fire. So beautiful are the sounds he hears, he is spellbound by their magic. Believing the couple to be a modern day witch and wizard he sets off on a journey of discovery to investigate further...</p>
<p>Beautifully imagined by Serbian illustrator Natasa Jovanic, 'A Witch &amp; A Wizard will fill the hearts of young readers with excitement and delight...</p>
<p>This beautiful 48 page hardcover book will be printed on uncoated papered and includes 20 full page hand drawn, full colour illustrations. The book will be available in both English and Spanish.</p>

Not to mention a global pandemic!</p>
<p>So against all the odds here it is and I couldn't be happier with it!</p>
<p>So enjoy a little verse... Tom's introduction to the mysterious Sapphire (the cat) for the first time.</p>

<p>Self-published hardback books must be printed in bulk to make them the most economical. With the funding I raise from this campaign, I will prepare and place a bulk order of 1000 books, as well as other goodies I will be giving away through this campaign. Here is the general cost breakdown:</p>
<p>Illustrations (€3,500)</p>
<p>Design/Layout (€300)</p>
<p>Printing of 1000 books (€4000)</p>
<p>Publishing Costs / ISBNs / Barcode (€150)</p>
<p>Other, to-be-determined costs include the production of the giveaway postcards and e-books, shipping, Indiegogo listing fee, and marketing of the book. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Meeting my funding goal will jumpstart the self-publication process and allow contributors to get their hands on a signed copy of the book before it's made available to the general public. Funds raised beyond €8000 will go straight towards printing fees for additional hard copies of the book. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is my second time to publish a book, I've got an amazing network of experienced and talented people behind me. Natasa has completed the illustrations, the layout has been finalised and the printer has the files.  Everything is set, and ready to go... </p>
<p>My major priority is shipping a high quality book to my backers, so barring any unfortunate printing disasters we anticipate the book will be in your hands in mid November, just in time for Christmas...</p>

<p>The year is 2121. The apocalypse has been and gone. Amidst the ruins of the old world, what is left of the human race fights for survival against gigantic, hyper-evolved Kaiju. Humanity's most effective weapons against the monsters are the colossal Mechs developed by the Guardian Programme.</p>

<p><i><strong>RONIN 47</strong></i> is a brand new interactive science fiction novel, inspired by the Legend of the Forty-Seven Ronin from Japan. In this adventure gamebook - a multi-path book, very much in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure or Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks - you direct the course of the story, deciding which routes to take, which perils to risk, and which of the monstrous creatures and rogue mechs you will meet along the way to fight. <i><strong>RONIN 47 </strong></i>will be the seventh title in the ongoing <a href=""https://www.acegamebooks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>ACE Gamebooks</strong></a> series.</p>

<p>One hundred years into the future, following an attempt to genetically re-engineer coral to make it more resistant to climate change (using something called the K Compound), Earth has been overrun by what are effectively, if accidentally, man-made Kaiju. Society has collapsed and groups of people exist in isolated bubbles around the world.</p>
<p>One of these pockets of humanity is Ako Base, a heavily-fortified and well-defended island community in the Philippine Sea. Squads of mechs operate out of the facility, tasked with keeping the tide of ever-evolving Kaiju at bay.</p>
<p>In <i><strong>RONIN 47</strong></i>, <strong>YOU </strong>take on the role of Commander Oishi, a Samurai-class mech pilot and leader of Phoenix Squad.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am an experienced author with more than 70 published books to my name, including 22 gamebooks. As a result you can be sure that I will see this project through to the end. I also have a formal contract with award-winning UK publisher Snowbooks Ltd to publish this book, pending the outcome of this Kickstarter.</p>
<p>And of course the book has already funded on Kickstarter, so you will definitely receive your mech-vs-kaiju <strong>ACE Gamebook</strong> after the campaign funds.</p>
</div></div>","The year is 2121. The apocalypse has been and gone. Amidst the ruins of the old world, what is left of the human race fights for survival against gigantic, hyper-evolved Kaiju. Humanity's most effective weapons against the monsters are the colossal Mechs developed by the Guardian Programme.

RONIN 47 is a brand new interactive science fiction novel, inspired by the Legend of the Forty-Seven Ronin from Japan. In this adventure gamebook - a multi-path book, very much in the style of Choose Your Own Adventure or Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks - you direct the course of the story, deciding which routes to take, which perils to risk, and which of the monstrous creatures and rogue mechs you will meet along the way to fight. RONIN 47 will be the seventh title in the ongoing ACE Gamebooks series.

One hundred years into the future, following an attempt to genetically re-engineer coral to make it more resistant to climate change (using something called the K Compound), Earth has been overrun by what are effectively, if accidentally, man-made Kaiju. Society has collapsed and groups of people exist in isolated bubbles around the world.
One of these pockets of humanity is Ako Base, a heavily-fortified and well-defended island community in the Philippine Sea. Squads of mechs operate out of the facility, tasked with keeping the tide of ever-evolving Kaiju at bay.
In RONIN 47, YOU take on the role of Commander Oishi, a Samurai-class mech pilot and leader of Phoenix Squad. When Deputy Director Kira turns traitor, killing Director Asano and stealing the new prototype Shogun-class mech, only YOU are left to pursue the villain and bring him to justice, battling all manner of mechs and mutated monsters along the way.

Mech designs by Neil Googe.



Throughout the course of the adventure, YOU decide which path to take, which risks to brave, and even which of the strange creatures you will meet along the way to engage in battle.
Success is by no means certain and you may well fail to complete the adventure at your first attempt. However, with experience, skill, and maybe even a little luck, each new attempt should bring you closer to your ultimate goal.
But whether you succeed in your quest, or not, will be down to the choices YOU make.

In addition to the book itself, you will need two six-sided dice, or a conventional pack of 52 playing cards, a pencil, an eraser, and a copy of the RONIN 47 Adventure Sheet (spare copies of which will be available for download from www.acegamebooks.com).

RONIN 47 is available to backers of this Kickstarter in three different formats - eBook (which will include hyperlinks), paperback, and a special, limited edition, signed, collector’s hardback.

Rewards on offer to backers include signed hardbacks, custom dice and playing cards, and exclusive art prints, as well as a unique slipcase edition that includes both a paperback and a signed hardback copy of the book.

The collector's hardback will include artist's sketches and designer's notes presented in a special bonus chapter at the back of the book, and colour artwork - if we hit Stretch Goal #5!
And everyone who pledges to receive a physical reward (in other words, from the SAMURAI level reward and above) will also receive a collectible ACE Gamebooks pin badge.

<p>Hello Friends! Thanks for checking out my campaign! I'm Shiva - a writer, artist, Priestess and Ordained Minister of The Satanic Temple. In 2020, just as COVID hit, I released my first book - <a href=""https://www.serpentinae.com/the-devils-tome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Devil's Tome: A Book of Modern Satanic Ritual</a>. I was overwhelmed and encouraged by the support it received and the explosion of interest around ritual practice. It resonated with so many people during this time of uncertainty and chaos. Many of the questions I received from readers were around rituals for death and grief. During this time, loss was all around me, and I saw a need to create a resource for our community. Thus, I  began my journey to understand how we, as Satanists, can embrace death and grief.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632761163/skzm9kszaxlavcv1bap6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Photo by <a href=""https://www.lightwitch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Courtney Brooke</a></i></p>
<p>As non-theistic Satanists, I think we’re uniquely positioned to acknowledge and confront the topic of death. Many of us even have been captivated by it - we understand the frailty of our time on earth and commit to live full lives. We see death as an inevitable and ever present aspect of lives and don’t have illusions of an afterlife to comfort us. So what can we do to help us cope with the passing of loved ones? How do we comfort others? What practical steps can we take to prepare ourselves for the end of life? How do we maintain our body's inviolability and navigate the medical and funeral industry? How do we incorporate ritual into our Satanic death work?</p>
<p><strong>The Devil's Death: Your Satanic Companion for Grief and Dying </strong>explores all of these questions and more. This one-of-a-kind resource was created to help Satanists navigate death and grief.</p>

<p><strong>The Devil's Death: Your Satanic Companion for Grief and Dying </strong>is a revolutionary book that shares not only practical guidance and best practices, but personal experience. It brings together a number of creators to birth a unique resource that will benefit Satanists as well as the broader secular community. </p>
<p>In addition to serving as a Priestess in my community, I draw on my career in the healthcare industry which included patient advocacy, clinical-translational research, evidence-based programming, and creating programs to improve the quality of patient care. To further my knowledge and explore end of life tools and resources and be able to share best practices with the community, I became a certified death doula. Together, these experiences provide a practical foundation for the book. I wanted to create a book that would speak to our experience as Satanists, leave out the platitudes, and be honest about the often messy and controversial aspects of grief and death care. In addition to sharing my wisdom gained as a ritual practitioner, death doula, and healthcare worker, I will also share my personal stories about death and grief including how I have dealt with the deaths of my abusers. </p>
<p>Understanding the need for this book, I partnered up with Betty Lee, a PhD biologist, clinical-translational researcher, Satanist, and advocate for personal autonomy in healthcare. Facing a serious and incurable medical condition, Betty set out to plan for her own secular funeral but found insufficient resources. Together, we have embarked on a journey of self-discovery as we have crafted this book and explored the concepts of death and dying from a secular, Satanic perspective. I asked longtime collaborator Alexander Corey to bring his incredible artistic vision to the book, and community herbalist Heather Mourer of <a href=""https://www.hedgewitchholistics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hedgewitch Holistics</a> to contribute a section on plant, potion, and herbal allies for death and grief.</p>

Hello Friends! Thanks for checking out my campaign! I'm Shiva - a writer, artist, Priestess and Ordained Minister of The Satanic Temple. In 2020, just as COVID hit, I released my first book - The Devil's Tome: A Book of Modern Satanic Ritual. I was overwhelmed and encouraged by the support it received and the explosion of interest around ritual practice. It resonated with so many people during this time of uncertainty and chaos. Many of the questions I received from readers were around rituals for death and grief. During this time, loss was all around me, and I saw a need to create a resource for our community. Thus, I  began my journey to understand how we, as Satanists, can embrace death and grief.

As non-theistic Satanists, I think we’re uniquely positioned to acknowledge and confront the topic of death. Many of us even have been captivated by it - we understand the frailty of our time on earth and commit to live full lives. We see death as an inevitable and ever present aspect of lives and don’t have illusions of an afterlife to comfort us. So what can we do to help us cope with the passing of loved ones? How do we comfort others? What practical steps can we take to prepare ourselves for the end of life? How do we maintain our body's inviolability and navigate the medical and funeral industry? How do we incorporate ritual into our Satanic death work?
The Devil's Death: Your Satanic Companion for Grief and Dying explores all of these questions and more. This one-of-a-kind resource was created to help Satanists navigate death and grief.


Like The Devil's Tome and my later creation The Devil's Deck, I am creating a limited first-edition fully illustrated printing that will serve as an art piece as much as a resource. The books will be fully illustrated by Alexander Corey (illustrator of The Devil's Deck and The Devil's tome) and myself. This printing will come in two forms, each limited to 111 signed and numbered copies:

 This limited edition book is heirloom quality. It has a black leather cover and gold foil stamping on the cover and spine. It contains a custom bookplate on the inside that will be signed and numbered. It is limited to 111 copies.

This limited edition paperback has a black on black cover. The cover design and spine are foiled black on top of the matte black cover. It contains a custom bookplate on the inside that will be signed and numbered. It is limited to 111 copies.

The Devil's Death: Your Satanic Companion for Grief and Dying will help you prepare for the end of life and assist you when you experience the loss. This book that can be used by those approaching the end of life, those who want to plan for it, those grieving from a death, and caretakers.
The Devil's Death: Your Satanic Companion for Grief and Dying will cover a wide-range of topics including:

How to approach death and find comfort through a non-theistic Satanic lens
Creating your own concept of 'A Good Death'
Creating your own end of life plan
Rituals for death and grief, including how to create your own funeral ceremony
Plant and herbal allies for death and grief
How to care for yourself through grief
How to deal with the death of abusers
Understanding your end of life options
Preparing Advance Directives
Protecting your bodily autonomy and advocating for your end of life rights
Practical tips and tools for navigating the medical and funeral industries
How to share your end of life wishes with your healthcare team, friends, and family
How to support others at the end of life
How to support loved ones through grief

 

The Devil's Death: Your Satanic Companion for Grief and Dying is a revolutionary book that shares not only practical guidance and best practices, but personal experience.

<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<p>We're crowdfunding a new translation of Meyer 1570 by a professional German translator, and it will be free to use for the whole community when it's done. We're selling ebooks and physical copies to cover the costs, and also producing a full facsimile of the painted Meyer. Book options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just the translation (hardcover, softcover, or ebook)</li>
<li>Transcription and translation side-by-side (hardcover or softcover)</li>
<li>Separate book of illustrations in color and B&amp;W (hardcover or softcover)</li>
<li>Detailed facsimile</li>
<li>Prestige edition (translation laid out like the original book and constructed like the facsimile)</li>
</ul> <h3>Background</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Chidester. I started HEMA in 2001, and since 2010 I've been leading a project called Wiktenauer. Wiktenauer grew out of a desire to set the text of our fencing manuals free from the page and put it into the hands of fencers. In 2019, I started a venture called HEMA Bookshelf with a different objective: to put the page, and the whole book, into your hands as well. To date, we've produced <a href=""https://www.hemabookshelf.com/facsimiles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">three gorgeous facsimiles</a> of 15th century manuscripts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628707757/auxv5m5msuda9vk5ptzh.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Fiore and Talhoffer facsimiles (Photo cred: David Rawlings)</i></p>
<p>This project is the first joint venture between these two projects: we're going to produce a a complete, professional translation of <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Joachim_Meyer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joachim Meyer</a>'s famous <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Gr%C3%BCndtliche_Beschreibung_der_Kunst_des_Fechtens_(Joachim_Meyer)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">printed treatise of 1570</a>.</p>
<p>Meyer is by far the longest of the early German treatises, and is the most popular 16th century source in HEMA. But getting an English version has been harder than it sounds. The first <a href=""https://www.angelfire.com/vt/meyer/JoachimMeyer1600.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meyer translation project</a> was launched by Mark Rector in early 2000, but he only got as far as a partial transcription. Mike Rasmusson picked up the torch in 2002 and put a partial <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20020623094615/http://schielhau.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">translation of the sword section</a> on Schielhau.org, but he never continued either. (This is the translation currently on Wiktenauer.) This inspired Jeffrey Forgeng to try his hand, and he authored a complete translation in 2003, ultimately publishing it in 2006. This book was hugely popular, but within five years the entire print run sold out and it became impossible to get. When a second edition finally came out in 2015, it likewise sold out within a few years.</p>
<p>But even if Dr. Forgeng's translation were easy to get forever, what we really need in order to grow the community is a translation that's free for everyone to read and practice from, and also to edit and remix and post on Facebook and quote in YouTube videos, all without the worrying about copyright.</p>
<p>So that's what we're going to make.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628708320/q5zysfnsm1c2hphgwoar.png"" src=""""/><br/><i>Title page from the University of Leipzig copy</i></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I've hired Dr. Rebecca Garber to author the new translation. She has previously worked with HEMA Bookshelf on the Talhoffer Companion Volume, and a longer biography is below. She's already halfway through the book, currently working through the rapier section, and we've been running her translations past various Meyer scholars and instructors for feedback once she finishes them.</p>
<p>In addition to Dr. Garber's translation, I've spent the first half of the year slowly transcribing the entire book, and you can now find this transcription on Wiktenauer.</p>
<p>Meyer's book is incredibly long, so creating this translation will cost $12,000. On top of that, we need to pay for editing, layout, printing costs, advertising, and so forth. That's why we're coming to you.</p>
<p>To cover this bill, we will be selling the new transcription and translation in a variety of formats. These books will also include a lengthy introduction and historical background contributed by Chris Vanslambrouck, captain of the Meyer Freifechter Guild, and Roger Norling, Editor-in-Chief of HROARR.</p>
<h4><i>The Reading Edition (translation only)</i></h4>
<p>This will be a smaller format sized to carry around and be comfortable to hold in one hand (royal quarto, 6.14 x 9.21 in). It will contain the translation along with black and white illustrations. This comes in ePub, softcover, and hardcover.</p>
<h4><i>The Study Edition/Dual-Language Edition (transcription and translation)</i></h4>
<p>This will be a larger format, either A4 or 8.5 x 11 in. It will consist of a two-column setup with the transcription and translation side-by-size. It will not include illustrations (or if it does, only small black and white ones at the back), but will be designed as part of a 2-volume set with the illustration book.</p>
<h4><i>The Visual Reference (illustrations only)</i></h4>
<p>This will include all 69 of Tobias Stimmer's original prints at their original size, and also the full set of painted prints from the University of Leipzig’s copy at 150% of their original size. Alongside these illustrations will be tables indicating all of the references to each one in the text, including the page numbers in Meyer’s book, the Reading and Study Editions, and Dr. Jeffrey Forgeng’s 2006 translation, as well as the name of the play or description of the action. (This will be substantially similar to <a href=""http://www.hemabookshelf.com/illustrated-meyer"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Illustrated Meyer</i></a>, so you can buy the Study Edition separately if you already own that.)</p>
<h4><i>A New Facsimile</i></h4>
<p>HEMA Bookshelf has promised and delivered quality replicas of historical manuscripts at affordable prices. To support this project, we're going to produce our first facsimile of a printed book: Joachim Meyer's <i>Gründtliche Beschreibung der... Kunst des Fechtens</i>. There are 28 known copies of this book, and the one we're reproducing is the gorgeous <a href=""https://digital.ub.uni-leipzig.de/object/viewid/0000009663"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leipzig University copy</a>, including its original hand-painted, full-color illustrations and 16th century binding.</p>
<p>In addition to using the high-resolution scans of this copy as a basis, I will be visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art on New York to consult their copy of the 1570 and study its construction in order to create the best replica possible. (Details of other copies found during the ongoing Meyer Location Project may also sneak in.)</p>
<p>This facsimile will be our longest yet (460 pages), with every detail as close to the original as possible. That includes blind-tooled leather covers reproducing the design of Leipzig copy, including Lucretia and Justitia, and the pages reproduced in every detail on cotton rag pape in the correct quire structure. The result will have the look and feel of an actual historical artifact.</p>
<h4><i>The Prestige Edition (translation only)</i></h4>
<p>If facsimiles aren't your thing, we're trying something brand new with this project. Since Meyer is ultimately a printed book, we're going to take Dr. Garber's translation, lay it out page-by-page the same way Thiebolt Berger did in 1570, and then print it and bind it using the same materials and methods as the facsimile. We'll also include the painted Leipzig illustrations, of course. The result will be the most gorgeous HEMA translation you'll ever own.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628709080/wafs9xdqfty6yfg1y3ys.png"" src=""""/><br/><i>The rear cover to the University of Leipzig copy.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has two objectives. One is obviously to publish new books and to add something beautiful to the world that didn't exist before. That's the reason HEMA Bookshelf exists in the first place.</p>
<p>The other is to create a translation and then give it away. It will be posted on Wiktenauer in its entirety under a <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license. This means you'll be able to use it however you want to, forever (as long as you credit Dr. Garber and Wiktenauer, and as long as you make no claims of copyright over it). You'll be able to distribute it to your students (or your teachers), and you'll even be able to publish your own version of it if you want to.</p>
<p>At Wiktenauer, our guiding philosophy is that the treatises belong to all of us. They're part of our cultural heritage as humans and the foundation of everything we do in HEMA. We respect the copyrights of others but ultimately, Wiktenauer's main mission is to give the treatises away for free. This project will help us further that goal.</p>
<p>If people we don't know and have never met are able to study Meyer because they stumbled onto this translation, then Wiktenauer will have succeeded at its mission.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628709146/wcrrooabi3zgbizfwbs5.png"" src=""""/><br/><i>Text and illustration from the University of Leipzig copy.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks of this project are minimal. HEMA Bookshelf has published three facsimiles and four conventional books at this point and we know the ropes. We're not trying anything particularly different with these, so the main risk is the ever-looming threat of covid-related shutdowns, which have caused months of delays in past projects.</p>
<p>The challenge we face is raising enough money to pay for the translation and editing. In order to keep prices down, our margins on the books and facsimiles are never as large as most publishers expect, but if we sell about as many as in past projects we should be okay.</p>

<h3>About the Translator</h3>
<p>Rebecca L. R. Garber received her PhD in German Languages and Literatures from the University of Michigan in 1999, with a specialization in Medieval Studies. She taught for 3 years at Wayne State University and then at a private high school before turning to translation as a full-time occupation. After joining a stage combat troupe in Michigan in 2006, she began translating combat manuals with CHEMAS (the Cambridge HEMA Study group), where her expertise in Medieval German and Latin was more useful than in most aspects of modern life. Her previous published HEMA translations include “Florius de Arte Luctandi” (with Kendra Brown) in <i>The Flower of Battle of Master Fiore Furlano de’I Liberi</i>, and the Copenhagen Talhoffer manuscript in <i>Alte Armatur und Ringkunst</i>, the companion volume to HEMA Bookshelf's facsimile. These translations can also be found on Wiktenauer. She has also worked on MS I.33, Codex Wallerstein, Paulus Hector Mair, and Jörg Wilhalm for private use.</p>

In order to keep up with the tumultuous price shifts of the current shipping market, I won't be collecting shipping fees until the books are printed and ready to mail.

UPDATE 22 OCT 21: I've raised the cost the facsimile and the prestige translation, and added new perks accordingly. The cost of the conventional books remains the same. 
tl;dr
We're crowdfunding a new translation of Meyer 1570 by a professional German translator, and it will be free to use for the whole community when it's done. We're selling ebooks and physical copies to cover the costs, and also producing a full facsimile of the painted Meyer. Book options include:

Just the translation (hardcover, softcover, or ebook)
Transcription and translation side-by-side (hardcover or softcover)
Separate book of illustrations in color and B&W (hardcover or softcover)
Detailed facsimile
Prestige edition (translation laid out like the original book and constructed like the facsimile)
 Background
My name is Michael Chidester. I started HEMA in 2001, and since 2010 I've been leading a project called Wiktenauer. Wiktenauer grew out of a desire to set the text of our fencing manuals free from the page and put it into the hands of fencers. In 2019, I started a venture called HEMA Bookshelf with a different objective: to put the page, and the whole book, into your hands as well. To date, we've produced three gorgeous facsimiles of 15th century manuscripts.
Fiore and Talhoffer facsimiles (Photo cred: David Rawlings)
This project is the first joint venture between these two projects: we're going to produce a a complete, professional translation of Joachim Meyer's famous printed treatise of 1570.
Meyer is by far the longest of the early German treatises, and is the most popular 16th century source in HEMA. But getting an English version has been harder than it sounds. The first Meyer translation project was launched by Mark Rector in early 2000, but he only got as far as a partial transcription. Mike Rasmusson picked up the torch in 2002 and put a partial translation of the sword section on Schielhau.org, but he never continued either. (This is the translation currently on Wiktenauer.) This inspired Jeffrey Forgeng to try his hand, and he authored a complete translation in 2003, ultimately publishing it in 2006. This book was hugely popular, but within five years the entire print run sold out and it became impossible to get. When a second edition finally came out in 2015, it likewise sold out within a few years.
But even if Dr. Forgeng's translation were easy to get forever, what we really need in order to grow the community is a translation that's free for everyone to read and practice from, and also to edit and remix and post on Facebook and quote in YouTube videos, all without the worrying about copyright.
So that's what we're going to make.

What We Need & What You Get

I've hired Dr. Rebecca Garber to author the new translation. She has previously worked with HEMA Bookshelf on the Talhoffer Companion Volume, and a longer biography is below. She's already halfway through the book, currently working through the rapier section, and we've been running her translations past various Meyer scholars and instructors for feedback once she finishes them.
In addition to Dr. Garber's translation, I've spent the first half of the year slowly transcribing the entire book, and you can now find this transcription on Wiktenauer.
Meyer's book is incredibly long, so creating this translation will cost $12,000. On top of that, we need to pay for editing, layout, printing costs, advertising, and so forth. That's why we're coming to you.
To cover this bill, we will be selling the new transcription and translation in a variety of formats. These books will also include a lengthy introduction and historical background contributed by Chris Vanslambrouck, captain of the Meyer Freifechter Guild, and Roger Norling, Editor-in-Chief of HROARR.
The Reading Edition (translation only)
This will be a smaller format sized to carry around and be comfortable to hold in one hand (royal quarto, 6.14 x 9.21 in). It will contain the translation along with black and white illustrations. This comes in ePub, softcover, and hardcover.
The Study Edition/Dual-Language Edition (transcription and translation)
This will be a larger format, either A4 or 8.5 x 11 in. It will consist of a two-column setup with the transcription and translation side-by-size. It will not include illustrations (or if it does, only small black and white ones at the back), but will be designed as part of a 2-volume set with the illustration book.
The Visual Reference (illustrations only)
This will include all 69 of Tobias Stimmer's original prints at their original size, and also the full set of painted prints from the University of Leipzig’s copy at 150% of their original size. Alongside these illustrations will be tables indicating all of the references to each one in the text, including the page numbers in Meyer’s book, the Reading and Study Editions, and Dr. Jeffrey Forgeng’s 2006 translation, as well as the name of the play or description of the action. (This will be substantially similar to The Illustrated Meyer, so you can buy the Study Edition separately if you already own that.)
A New Facsimile
HEMA Bookshelf has promised and delivered quality replicas of historical manuscripts at affordable prices. To support this project, we're going to produce our first facsimile of a printed book: Joachim Meyer's Gründtliche Beschreibung der... Kunst des Fechtens. There are 28 known copies of this book, and the one we're reproducing is the gorgeous Leipzig University copy, including its original hand-painted, full-color illustrations and 16th century binding.
In addition to using the high-resolution scans of this copy as a basis, I will be visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art on New York to consult their copy of the 1570 and study its construction in order to create the best replica possible. (Details of other copies found during the ongoing Meyer Location Project may also sneak in.)
This facsimile will be our longest yet (460 pages), with every detail as close to the original as possible. That includes blind-tooled leather covers reproducing the design of Leipzig copy, including Lucretia and Justitia, and the pages reproduced in every detail on cotton rag pape in the correct quire structure. The result will have the look and feel of an actual historical artifact.
The Prestige Edition (translation only)
If facsimiles aren't your thing, we're trying something brand new with this project. Since Meyer is ultimately a printed book, we're going to take Dr. Garber's translation, lay it out page-by-page the same way Thiebolt Berger did in 1570, and then print it and bind it using the same materials and methods as the facsimile. We'll also include the painted Leipzig illustrations, of course. The result will be the most gorgeous HEMA translation you'll ever own.

The Impact
This project has two objectives. One is obviously to publish new books and to add something beautiful to the world that didn't exist before. That's the reason HEMA Bookshelf exists in the first place.
The other is to create a translation and then give it away. It will be posted on Wiktenauer in its entirety under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. This means you'll be able to use it however you want to, forever (as long as you credit Dr. Garber and Wiktenauer, and as long as you make no claims of copyright over it). You'll be able to distribute it to your students (or your teachers), and you'll even be able to publish your own version of it if you want to.
At Wiktenauer, our guiding philosophy is that the treatises belong to all of us. They're part of our cultural heritage as humans and the foundation of everything we do in HEMA. We respect the copyrights of others but ultimately, Wiktenauer's main mission is to give the treatises away for free. This project will help us further that goal.
If people we don't know and have never met are able to study Meyer because they stumbled onto this translation, then Wiktenauer will have succeeded at its mission.

Risks & Challenges
The risks of this project are minimal. HEMA Bookshelf has published three facsimiles and four conventional books at this point and we know the ropes. We're not trying anything particularly different with these, so the main risk is the ever-looming threat of covid-related shutdowns, which have caused months of delays in past projects.
The challenge we face is raising enough money to pay for the translation and editing. In order to keep prices down, our margins on the books and facsimiles are never as large as most publishers expect, but if we sell about as many as in past projects we should be okay.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute to this project, please spread the word anyway. We received about 400 orders each for the Talhoffer and Fiore facsimiles, and about 275 for Lecküchner, so let's see if there are at least that many Meyer enthusiasts out there!

<p><strong>Humans are Weird: We Took a Vote</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>""If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.""</p>
<p>— Mark Twain</p>
<p>The best science fiction is 95% real life. If you keep your characters real, if  you keep their reactions and relationships close to what you have personaly observed in the world around you, you will have to depend on your pure imagination. In short, write what you know. Humans are weird, and we all know it, we have all seen it. How will this little fact affect how our alien friends see us? </p>
<p>Betty Adams lives in a particularly damp and remote corner of the Pacific Northwest and, like a hobbit, enjoys visitors so long as she knows them in advance and knows when they are coming. She was born sometime last century and will likely die sometime this century. She works winters on a small organic research farm when not writing and spends most of her time herding eccentric genius scientists (she is absolutely certain cats would be easier) with the help of her Great Pyrenees mix. Summers she spends nomadically wandering the Pacific Northwest in search of material for her stories and a regular paycheck for a biology major (she is reasonably certain those are on the Endangered Species List). She has several works published in the National Park Internal Database which may or may not be classified documents.</p>
<p>In the words of that immortal  bard, Samuel J. Snodgrass, ""Make 'em laugh!"" I wanted to spread some joy in the world and after years of trying this, that, and the other I discovered I had a talent for pointing out the absurdity inherent in the everyday life of humanity. </p>
<p>So let's capture that sense of wonder.</p>
<p>Quilx'tch wonders why the human is fishing in a river, with no fish in it...</p>
<p>Commander Fifty-seven Clicks wonders why in the name of the mother swarm would a human continue to work with a displaced rib?</p>
<p>A Shatar Botanist has to wonder what the human wants one of her banana trees for if he doesn't plan on eating the bananas, and what does this have to do with his matrial art? </p>
<p>Second Sister wonders why she ever left her Father's hive....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have YOU ever wondered what happens when Monty Python meets Star Trek? </p>
<p>Satisify that curiosity! </p>
<p>Your contribution will bring that laughter to fruition. I will publish a paperback version and an electronic version of ~ 38,000 words of the fully edited  and compiled works and ~ 12,000 previous unseen words. My goal is to write full time and if we meet the stretch goals I will be able to do that. </p>
<p>Imagine a cozy cabin in the woods. Just the author, a big old dog, a cup of tea sending a tendril of steam into the air, and the steady tic-tic-tacing of the keyboard churning out more stories for you to read. You cannot find me. You cannot trace me. But you will get the fruit of my labors on a regular basis! </p>
<p>You will laugh! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>Break it down for folks in more detail:</strong></p>
<p>We need to pay the printers. That is going to cost around $1400</p>
<p>We need to pay shipping and fulfillment which will cost another $1000</p>
<p>We are going to fund the art, editing, and various costs of the next book in the series which will be another $1000 before printing begins.  </p>
<p>The author would also like to buy some things so that is the final $100</p>
<p>You get laughter! Joy! That special feeling you get when you find that package you have been waiting for sitting on your front step! The first perk is our chuckle-inducing E-book.  The second perk is a paperback. You will evenutally get the author read audiobook If we get to the stretch goals we will look at things like posters, stickers, postcards, all with the fantastic original art commissioned just for this project. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal  we will take stock of the situation. If there is enough to print the books we will get them printed and sent off. If not, we will send out the E-books and will get contributor feedback on if you want refunds or postcard art consolation printings. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Right now I am that author working a day job and squeezing in writing between gigs. Funding this will enable me to achieve my goal of a little cabin out in the woods with a full time career making people laugh through my written words. Funding this will enable me to turn tea into joy as well as putting food on the table of several printers, editors, artists, and ….what do you call fulfillment service types? </p>
<p>For as long as humanity has had records we have recorded two things. Humans desperately need a laugh, and humans are the things most worth laughing at. I offer up this plate of wholesome laughter, hopping to make your day a little easier. This is my bison sketched on the wall of my cave, my etchings on the Rosetta Stone. Let them laugh. </p>
<p>I have successfully funded and published a full length novel in 2015 ""Dying Embers"" BE WARNED. That is a very different book if you are curious about it. There is laughter in it, but it is entwined with a broken heart. </p>
<p>There is so much pain in the world. I can't get rid of the pain, but I can make 'em laugh! and I want to do my small part to make a better world. </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There will always be risks and challenges when publishing a book. We might not get funded. A storm might flood the distribution center literally or figuratively. This I can promise you: I will do everything within my power to make sure that this book lands on your doorstep as soon as possible. </p>
<p>I have done it before and I will do it again. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<p><strong>What is <i>A Journey for Happiness: The Man Who Cycled to Bhutan</i> about? </strong></p>
<p>Christopher had always been fascinated with happiness. So much so that he had got his PhD and gone on to become <strong>a world-leading expert on the topic</strong>. However, his university job researching happiness wasn’t making him happy at all. With all his academic successes he couldn’t find time to apply all the wonderful insights on happiness to his own life. He was certain there had to be a different way, not just for himself, but for all of us. And so <strong>he quit his job, saddled up, and began cycling to Bhutan</strong>; a curious little country nestled in the Himalayas that is famed for its society centred around happiness.</p>
<p><i>A Journey for Happiness</i> is based around the extraordinary real-life 18-month 20,000km journey that the author made around the world on his bicycle to Bhutan. <strong>It interweaves personal stories with pioneering happiness research</strong>, to explore what it means to live a happy life. The journey brought unbridled joy and pleasure, as well as ferocious challenge and heartache. By the end, there came a deep contented sense of happiness. The sort of happiness that doesn’t come and go without warning and ought to be available to anyone. Through an epic cycle journey, with a few extra stories thrown in, <strong>this book explores what it will take for us all to be a little happier in this world of ours.</strong></p>
<p><strong>***</strong>The journey has been featured on the BBC’s <i>People Fixing the World</i>, reported in <i>The Times </i>and <i>The Independent,</i> discussed on TALK Radio and TNT’s <i>Roundtable</i>, and aired on Bhutanese, Mexican, and Thai TV.</p>
<p><b>We are still accepting pre-orders with delivery aimed for March 2022</b></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone that has supported A Journey for Happiness so far. We exceeded our funding goal and raised enough to get <i>A Journey for Happiness</i> edited, printed, and distributed.  Though the crowdfund is no longer LIVE it is still possible to pre-order a copy.</p>
<p>At this stage, the more copies that are ordered, the more copies we will be able to print and distribute at a later date. We want to get this book into as many hands as possible. You will see that <strong>all perks ultimately have a book, or a few, involved</strong>. This means that beyond the happiness boost that you’ll get from reading the book itself, you have the opportunity for even more happiness. There is the very limited hardback version (only a few copies left now).  There is the paperback version with various add-ons. Plus, there are still opportunities to meet the author both online and in real life,  journey for a day with the author, have your name acknowledged in the book, or have the author give a public talk. You could even get Christopher to write an article for you about happiness. And let's not forget, there is also the possibility of becoming a friend of <i>A Journey for Happiness</i>, or even become A Big Sponsor.</p>
<p>All perks include shipping costs. There are add-ons available at the checkout (mugs, postcards, hardback upgrades) and can be used to make all manner of perky combinations. For example, a mug and a cycle with the author, or a set of postcards and a hardback...the choice is yours.</p>
<p>We’d also really love it if you could share this crowdfund widely with your personal and professional networks, so please go ahead and share with friends and family, and your work colleagues. After all, who doesn’t long for a little more happiness?</p>
<p><strong>Having problems contributing?</strong></p>
<p>If anyone has had problems contributing to the crowdfund then please get in touch. Some have told me that their contributions have not gone through after repeated attempts. Others thought they'd contributed, when in fact they weren't on the list of contributors. If you are worried yours hasn't gone through, feel free to get in contact to check.</p>
<p>If you've contributed you should receive updates about the books progress over the coming months. If you haven't received any updates then either check your bank statement (INDIEGOGO*HAPPY BOOK is the reference) or get in touch direct to confirm the order.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><p><strong>Since we have now hit our target </strong>the only big challenge now is delivering the book on time. March 2022 is the expected delivery date. We want to get the book in your hands before International Day of Happiness on 20th March 2022.  There should be plenty of time from the end of this campaign to enable the editing, printing, and delivery to be carried out and completed by then. <strong>As of 15th October the copy-editor has the manuscript.</strong></p><p>Note, that some of the other perks, such as talks, meets, walks, have longer delivery dates because they will be arranged with you for sometime in the spring or summer of 2022. Nevertheless, we aim to get the book part of those perks over to you in March 2022. </p><p>Shipping costs have been budgeted into each perk.

Thank you to everyone that has supported A Journey for Happiness so far. We exceeded our funding goal and raised enough to get A Journey for Happiness edited, printed, and distributed.  Though the crowdfund is no longer LIVE it is still possible to pre-order a copy.
At this stage, the more copies that are ordered, the more copies we will be able to print and distribute at a later date. We want to get this book into as many hands as possible. You will see that all perks ultimately have a book, or a few, involved. This means that beyond the happiness boost that you’ll get from reading the book itself, you have the opportunity for even more happiness. There is the very limited hardback version (only a few copies left now).  There is the paperback version with various add-ons. Plus, there are still opportunities to meet the author both online and in real life,  journey for a day with the author, have your name acknowledged in the book, or have the author give a public talk. You could even get Christopher to write an article for you about happiness. And let's not forget, there is also the possibility of becoming a friend of A Journey for Happiness, or even become A Big Sponsor.
All perks include shipping costs. There are add-ons available at the checkout (mugs, postcards, hardback upgrades) and can be used to make all manner of perky combinations. For example, a mug and a cycle with the author, or a set of postcards and a hardback...the choice is yours.
We’d also really love it if you could share this crowdfund widely with your personal and professional networks, so please go ahead and share with friends and family, and your work colleagues. After all, who doesn’t long for a little more happiness?
Having problems contributing?
If anyone has had problems contributing to the crowdfund then please get in touch. Some have told me that their contributions have not gone through after repeated attempts. Others thought they'd contributed, when in fact they weren't on the list of contributors. If you are worried yours hasn't gone through, feel free to get in contact to check.
If you've contributed you should receive updates about the books progress over the coming months. If you haven't received any updates then either check your bank statement (INDIEGOGO*HAPPY BOOK is the reference) or get in touch direct to confirm the order.
Risks & Challenges
Since we have now hit our target the only big challenge now is delivering the book on time. March 2022 is the expected delivery date. We want to get the book in your hands before International Day of Happiness on 20th March 2022.  There should be plenty of time from the end of this campaign to enable the editing, printing, and delivery to be carried out and completed by then. As of 15th October the copy-editor has the manuscript.Note, that some of the other perks, such as talks, meets, walks, have longer delivery dates because they will be arranged with you for sometime in the spring or summer of 2022. Nevertheless, we aim to get the book part of those perks over to you in March 2022. Shipping costs have been budgeted into each perk. There are no additional shipping fees to pay.Follow Christopher Boyce on:Twitter: https://twitter.com/drhappyboyceWordpress: https://journeyforhappiness.co.uk/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/AdventureInHappinessCy...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/journeyforhappinessuk/Thank you.

<h3>Get to know me! What's this about?</h3>
<p>Hello!  I'm Claire, and I'm a music lover and avid concert goer, among other things. My MasterCard bill alone through the years would prove this to you, but I even legally changed my last name to my favorite rock star. That, however, is another story....</p>
<p>Right now, I'm inviting your support to get my novel ""When I Remember You"" edited and prepared for publication. I've spent many, MANY, late nights at my kitchen table (and sometimes soaking in a warm bubble bath) crafting the story, the characters, their actions, what it all means, why it should matter to anyone, finding the right mix to make it entertaining yet dramatic and fun yet meaningful and sexy, 'cause people like to know something sexy might happen, and - oh, there's a handsome rock star involved and... need I say more? </p>
<p>I wanted to write a story to demonstrate how an interest in an artist and the shared experience of live music creates close friendships. This is something on which I consider myself an expert. I also wanted to give a glimpse into the underworld of what it's like to be passionate about an artist going beyond simply buying their latest album and seeing them when they come to your city. Plus,I enjoy writing and wanted to put a bunch of words together and provide some entertainment. AND, big selling point here: you can expect there will be perfect use of all grammar including the proper forms of I and me, subject verb agreement, the reflexive tense, appropriate punctuation of compound sentences, and nothing improperly capitalized. (An occasional fragment may be used for dramatic effect. Kind of exciting in itself.)</p>
<p>Most of all though, I wanted to write a story for all of my fan friends to honor the mutual understanding and dedication we have in this unique hobby of being loyal supporters of musicians we love.</p>
<p>Will you help me make it a reality? </p>

<h3>Editing, cover art, and other costs... oh my</h3>
<p>I may be a master grammar person (person?) thanks to my mom and dad (Jack and Madalyn!), but this is  my first novel, (first one I've put out there). If I'm going to ask people to buy it, it has to be in top form. Plus, I want it to be spectacular for you. If you're giving your time to my prose, then it should be deserving of your attention.</p>
<p>Editors charge by the word, and right now my manuscript stands at about 82,000 of them -  82,000 intriguing, page-turning bits of literary goodness to entertain you. To get those words and pages whipped into shape, I've already spent $2000 to hire a seasoned editor committed to getting my book ready to go. </p>
<p>That amount does not take into account the publishing prep costs, cover artwork design, shipping, and all the envelopes to send the autographed ones on their way, etc, etc. The estimated up front need is an additional $3,000.  </p>
<p>It's a big undertaking! But I so want to do this, and I'd foot the whole bill to put it out there myself  if I could due to my love of the project; but your help, whatever you can do, would make it so much better.</p>

<h3>Humans are Weird: I Have the Data </h3>
<p>“A good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.”<br/>— Sci-Fi Master Fredrik Pohl</p>
<p> Simply put, truth in advertising. Humans are weird, and we all know it. How will this little fact affect how our alien friends see us? </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Betty Adams lives in a particularly damp and remote corner of the Pacific Northwest and, like a hobbit, enjoys visitors so long as she knows them in advance and knows when they are coming. She was born sometime last century and will likely die sometime this century. She works winters on a small organic research farm when not writing and spends most of her time herding eccentric genius scientists (she is absolutely certain cats would be easier) with the help of her Great Pyrenees mix. Summers she spends nomadically wandering the Pacific Northwest in search of material for her stories and a regular paycheck for a biology major (she is reasonably certain those are on the Endangered Species List). She has several works published in the National Park Internal Database which may or may not be classified documents.</p></li>
<li>In the words of that immortal  bard, Samuel J. Snodgrass, ""Make 'em laugh!"" I wanted to spread some joy in the world and after years of trying this, that, and the other I discovered I had a talent for pointing out the absurdity inherent in the everyday life of humanity. </li>
<li>If you are looking for epic space battles, if you are looking for generals winning victory through genius tactics, if you are looking for berserker warriors carrying empires aloft on their swords,  look elsewhere my friends.  Here you will find laughter.</li>
<li>Here a quartermaster must discover why the humans insists that the mass produced broom, identical down to the molecule to every other broom on the base, is the ""wrong"" broom, and why and how they expect him to fix it. </li>
<li>Here aliens learn the meaning of ""enough C4""</li>
<li>Here a medic meets the challenge of understanding why a human thinks it can survive on chocolate cake. </li>
<li>Here Monty Python meets Star Trek. </li>
<li>Here I make 'em laugh! </li>
<li>Your contribution will bring that laughter to fruition. I will publish a paperback version and an electronic version of 38,000 words of the fully edited  and compiled works and 12,000 previous unseen words.

<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to pay the printers. That is going to cost around $1000<ul>
<li>We need to pay shipping and fulfillment which will cost another $1500</li>
<li>We are going to fund the art, editing, and various costs of the next book in the series which will be another $1500 before printing begins.  </li>
<li>The author would also like to eat occasionally thus the final $1000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You get laughter! Joy! That special feeling you get when you find that package you have been waiting for sitting on your front step! The first perk is our chuckle-inducing E-book.  The second perk is a paperback. If we get to the stretch goals we will look at things like posters, stickers, postcards, all with the fantastic original art commissioned just for this project. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal  we will take stock of the situation. If there is enough to print the books we will get them printed and sent off. If not, we will send out the E-books and will get contributor feedback on if you want refunds or postcard art consolation printings. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Right now I am that author working a day job and squeezing in writing between gigs. Funding this will enable me to achieve my goal of a little cabin out in the woods with a full time career making people laugh through my written words. Funding this will enable me to turn tea into joy as well as putting food on the table of several printers, editors, artists, and ….what do you call fulfillment service types? </p>
<ul>
<li>For as long as humanity has had records we have recorded two things. Humans desperately need a laugh, and humans are the things most worth laughing at. I offer up this plate of wholesome laughter, hopping to make your day a little easier. This is my bison sketched on the wall of my cave, my etchings on the Rosetta Stone. Let them laugh. </li>

“A good science fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.”— Sci-Fi Master Fredrik Pohl
 Simply put, truth in advertising. Humans are weird, and we all know it. How will this little fact affect how our alien friends see us? 

Betty Adams lives in a particularly damp and remote corner of the Pacific Northwest and, like a hobbit, enjoys visitors so long as she knows them in advance and knows when they are coming. She was born sometime last century and will likely die sometime this century. She works winters on a small organic research farm when not writing and spends most of her time herding eccentric genius scientists (she is absolutely certain cats would be easier) with the help of her Great Pyrenees mix. Summers she spends nomadically wandering the Pacific Northwest in search of material for her stories and a regular paycheck for a biology major (she is reasonably certain those are on the Endangered Species List). She has several works published in the National Park Internal Database which may or may not be classified documents.
In the words of that immortal  bard, Samuel J. Snodgrass, ""Make 'em laugh!"" I wanted to spread some joy in the world and after years of trying this, that, and the other I discovered I had a talent for pointing out the absurdity inherent in the everyday life of humanity. 
If you are looking for epic space battles, if you are looking for generals winning victory through genius tactics, if you are looking for berserker warriors carrying empires aloft on their swords,  look elsewhere my friends.  Here you will find laughter.
Here a quartermaster must discover why the humans insists that the mass produced broom, identical down to the molecule to every other broom on the base, is the ""wrong"" broom, and why and how they expect him to fix it. 
Here aliens learn the meaning of ""enough C4""
Here a medic meets the challenge of understanding why a human thinks it can survive on chocolate cake. 
Here Monty Python meets Star Trek. 
Here I make 'em laugh! 
Your contribution will bring that laughter to fruition. I will publish a paperback version and an electronic version of 38,000 words of the fully edited  and compiled works and 12,000 previous unseen words. My goal is to write full time and if we meet the stretch goals I will be able to do that. 
Imagine a cozy cabin in the woods. Just the author, a big old dog, a cup of tea sending a tendril of steam into the air, and the steady tic-tic-tacing of the keyboard churning out more stories for you to read. You cannot find me. You cannot trace me. But you will get the fruit of my labors on a regular basis!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nathan Day. I am an Author Academy Award* and Imadjinn Award**-winning horror, urban fantasy and noir author published by Seventh Star Press and Hydra Publications. I am spear-heading <i>Through the Tempest Black</i>, a cosmic horror anthology, as editor in order to bring together award-winning authors (such as Bram Stoker award-winner Michael Knost and Imadjinn Award-winner Robb Hoff), established indie and small press authors and currently unpublished and unknown authors who I feel are deserving of their chance to be heard. Why? Because we all start from the bottom and work hard to elevate our talents and passions. All that I have currently achieved is because I was given a chance by publishers and juries of best-selling authors who saw promise in my work. Simply put, I want to pay that forward.</p>
<p>Through your generous contributions you are giving life to a literary project that will help grow readership for outstanding authors that work diligently to produce quality pieces but may not have reached the heights of best-seller lists (alongside some who have) as well as allowing new voices to be heard, appreciated and encouraged to pursue their dreams of becoming career authors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is a modest $3500 which would cover art, printing and formatting costs as well as reward each contributor with a $200 payment for the inclusion of their work. Many small press anthologies only pay contributors $10 and a copy of the book. Funding beyond $3500 will contribute towards the creation of a limited edition (hardback as a goal) which will include my own upcoming cosmic horror novella, <i>Pilgrimage.</i></p>
<p>Our perks include:</p>
<p>- standard and limited edition copies of Through the Tempest Black, both in print and digital</p>
<p>- exclusive limited edition 3D printed statuettes of the Great Old One, Hastur, and the Bleeding Mirror featured in the novella, <i>Pilgrimage</i></p>
<p>- a thank you to all donors</p>
<p>- personalized, hand-written ""thank yous"" signed by myself, editor/author Nathan Day inside your physical copy of <i>Through the Tempest Black</i></p>
<p>- having a character named after you in <i>Pilgrimage</i></p>
<p>- signed copies of other works from anthology contributors</p>
<p>If our goal of $3500 is not met by campaign's end, funds will be disbursed evenly among contributing authors after cover art and formatting costs have been met.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>The literary market is can be intimidating, especially as it is over-crowded with self-published indie authors and small press publishers. It is very difficult to have your work seen and stand out, especially when you are just starting out. Projects like this can help authors achieve recognition because it pools various established readerships and introduces them to new authors while helping first-time authors achieve an initial readership base.</p>
<p>I feel grateful that I am able to bring these various men and women together this effort and am able to do so because I have worked to earn their trust and respect both as an author and human. It is my desire to leverage this trust into a project we will all be proud of.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you are unable to contributor to this campaign financially, you can still potentially make a huge impact on our success by sharing the campaign through word of mouth, on social media platforms and by utilizing Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<h3><strong>Thank You!</strong></h3>
<p>I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your time and consideration in supporting this passion project. You stand to impact the lives and careers of talented and hard-working voices in ways that far exceed simple monetary compensation. I wish you the same luck and success in your own endeavors.</p>

Many small press anthologies only pay contributors $10 and a copy of the book. Funding beyond $3500 will contribute towards the creation of a limited edition (hardback as a goal) which will include my own upcoming cosmic horror novella, Pilgrimage.
Our perks include:
- standard and limited edition copies of Through the Tempest Black, both in print and digital
- exclusive limited edition 3D printed statuettes of the Great Old One, Hastur, and the Bleeding Mirror featured in the novella, Pilgrimage
- a thank you to all donors
- personalized, hand-written ""thank yous"" signed by myself, editor/author Nathan Day inside your physical copy of Through the Tempest Black
- having a character named after you in Pilgrimage
- signed copies of other works from anthology contributors
If our goal of $3500 is not met by campaign's end, funds will be disbursed evenly among contributing authors after cover art and formatting costs have been met.

Your Impact
The literary market is can be intimidating, especially as it is over-crowded with self-published indie authors and small press publishers. It is very difficult to have your work seen and stand out, especially when you are just starting out. Projects like this can help authors achieve recognition because it pools various established readerships and introduces them to new authors while helping first-time authors achieve an initial readership base.
I feel grateful that I am able to bring these various men and women together this effort and am able to do so because I have worked to earn their trust and respect both as an author and human. It is my desire to leverage this trust into a project we will all be proud of.
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you are unable to contributor to this campaign financially, you can still potentially make a huge impact on our success by sharing the campaign through word of mouth, on social media platforms and by utilizing Indiegogo share tools.
Thank You!
I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your time and consideration in supporting this passion project. You stand to impact the lives and careers of talented and hard-working voices in ways that far exceed simple monetary compensation. I wish you the same luck and success in your own endeavors.

It will be illustrated with original work from a fine artist. If you are a fan of Jonathan and his art, you'll love this work! If you are a classic literature buff, this book is right up your alley! If you like language and its creative, expressive use, you will be captivated by this story. See the excerpt below for a taste!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612536084/ehwkkmupiaauhlybpyjo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>And here's a note from Jonathan himself about how this book came to be:</p><p><i>       C.S. Lewis said, “<strong>The heart of Christianity is a myth, which is also a fact</strong>. The<br/>old myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be myth, comes down from<br/>the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history.”<br/>This book is ten years in the making. I first began writing it when my oldest<br/>son was six years old. He’s now sixteen and a writer himself. I wanted to<br/>write a <strong>heroic epic</strong> my children could grow up with and pass on to their<br/>children. Now, the time has come to share it with the world.<br/>       My son’s imagination was captured at an early age by the epic stories of<br/>Beowulf and Hercules. In these stories the longing for a hero emerges<br/>naturally and profoundly.

It will be illustrated with original work from a fine artist. If you are a fan of Jonathan and his art, you'll love this work! If you are a classic literature buff, this book is right up your alley! If you like language and its creative, expressive use, you will be captivated by this story. See the excerpt below for a taste! And here's a note from Jonathan himself about how this book came to be:       C.S. Lewis said, “The heart of Christianity is a myth, which is also a fact. Theold myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be myth, comes down fromthe heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history.”This book is ten years in the making. I first began writing it when my oldestson was six years old. He’s now sixteen and a writer himself. I wanted towrite a heroic epic my children could grow up with and pass on to theirchildren. Now, the time has come to share it with the world.       My son’s imagination was captured at an early age by the epic stories ofBeowulf and Hercules. In these stories the longing for a hero emergesnaturally and profoundly. As a father, I longed for this enthusiasm andexhilaration to eventually transcend mythology and ultimately be directedtowards Christ, the Hero of Heroes.       This poem explores the epic question: What happened between Christ’scrucifixion and resurrection? In the ancient Christian Tradition, it is said thatChrist not only suffered and died on the Cross physically, but that He alsodescended into Hell (Hades to be more precise) to destroy the power ofdeath and rescue imprisoned souls, breaking the iron bars of Death andHades.         In this story, the foreshadowing of pagan myths finds their fulfillment in theepic of Christ. The Harrowing of Hell is a glimpse into the untold chapterof the Greatest Story ever told.       This is a work of historical fiction, I prefer to call it a poem because poetrybrings us into the “sense of things”; it conveys truth through paradox,mystery, imagination and allegory, where concrete empirical knowledgeruns out.       Although there is a great deal of imagination and poetry in this work ofhistorical fiction, the author seeks to render a faithful depiction of Christ asrevealed in the New Testament and the ancient Christian Faith. It is apainting, more than an icon.       As an Eastern Orthodox Christian, I have encountered a differentunderstanding of Hell, man’s free will and the mercy of God, then is oftenarticulated in Western traditions. It is a vision that is not widely known inEurope or North America. It can be summed up by this phrase, “Even theflames of Hell are love.”        I am hoping that with your help, we will be able to raise enough money to print the first edition, featuring original illustrations. Any additional funds raised after expenses will be going to the monastery of the Life-Giving Spring in Ireland.        Millions around the world are journeying through Great Lent on their waytowards the Resurrection of Christ. In these difficult and troubling times, it ismy humble prayer that this book will assist the reader’s meditation on themercy of God and the lengths to which He will go to rescue us fromdarkness.       Many heroes have risen to the challenge.

</h3></div>","This‌ ‌catchy,‌ ‌witty‌ ‌compilation‌ ‌of‌ ‌inventions,‌ ‌filled‌ ‌with‌ ‌beautiful‌ ‌illustrations,‌ ‌is‌ ‌a‌ ‌wonderful‌ ‌gift‌ ‌for‌ ‌collectors,‌ ‌enthusiasts,‌ ‌and‌ ‌curious‌ ‌minds.‌StoryHave you ever imagined visiting the past with full knowledge of modern information and technology? If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?As a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay! As I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined! I realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries.  Now I want to share this book with everyone who hasn’t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.There is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.Vsevolod  Co-founder of The BookThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to The Summa Technologiae of Stanisław Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration. On the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won’t stop thinking of what you saw.This section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you’ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You’ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don’t need it anymore. We’ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We’ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We’ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.The whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there’s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it’s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we’ll reveal the most original one.Researchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that’s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes.In all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we’ve agreed that killing people isn’t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still….The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You’ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you’ll become immortal (for a while).The home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don’t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you’ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You’ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you’ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won’t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)It’s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you’ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You’ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer (which will literally be the best beer in the world since you’ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization).Life is not only about surviving; it’s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won’t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You’ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We’ll tell you how to make a vibrator.There is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It’s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don’t forget to ask about their notation too. Rituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?A Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You’ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.People had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep’s stomachs. And don’t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won’t be able to make your new world fully civilized. The intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world’s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn’t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.In one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Ultimate Guide you’ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.It is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.This book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.It is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

<p>This campaign is for pre-ordering the book, <strong><i>Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond</i></strong>. We know there are thousands of readers who want this book, which chronicles Claude Coats' contributions to the creation of Disneyland with Walt Disney.</p>
<p>This book will showcase Claude Coats' key innovations in immersive ride design, and his pioneering use of new technologies and visual methods that still influence theme park experiences today. Here is your chance to own a <i>First Edition</i> of what will be the prize of any Disney collection with its behind-the-scenes text, lush production value and rare, never-before-seen artwork and photos. Supported with the full cooperation of the Claude Coats estate and family, pre-ordering this book is your opportunity to join with us in documenting the legacy of a major creative force in the annals of the Disney universe. This is your chance to make history! </p>

<p>Over the last two years, I have worked closely with Claude Coats' son Alan Coats, also an Imagineer, to get a book published about his father through traditional publishing houses. Traditional publishers rely on sales teams to make the decisions on which books get published., so, it's not a surprise that we have been met with “he doesn’t have enough name recognition” from the various  publishers that the project has been pitched to. This has been frustrating to us both because <i>we know</i> that there are thousands of Disney fans and theme park enthusiasts who <i>do know</i> who Claude Coats is and what his stellar accomplishments are in Disney animation and at Disney Theme Parks worldwide. That is why we have decided to pitch <i>to you</i>, the fans and enthusiasts, on pre-ordering <strong><i>Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond</i></strong>, which we believe will show that this is a story that is worth telling. We hope that you will agree as well.</p>

<p align=""center"">(Claude Coats and Yale Gracey with <i>Adventure Thru Inner Space </i>model.)</p>
<p><strong><i>Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond</i></strong> is the story of artist and designer Claude Coats who, for more than half a century, was one of the most prolific creative talents at The Walt Disney Company and, arguably, the most accomplished. An unpretentious man of strapping stature, Claude was the artist behind some of the most stunning backgrounds produced at the Disney studio during the Golden Age of animation before becoming one of the eighteen founding members, <i>handed-picked by Walt Disney</i>, to start the fabled WED Enterprises—now known as Walt Disney Imagineering.</p>

<p align=""center""><i>(Pinocchio backgrounds painted by Claude Coats)</i></p>
<p>For the first time ever, this all-inclusive book will focus on one of the most revered artists who successfully crossed over from the animation department to become one of the original Imagineers. Working side by side with Walt Disney, Claude Coats was a major influence in not only creating the first theme park, but a new form of creativity called Imagineering that would forever change the worlds of global entertainment, technology, architecture and popular culture.</p>

<p align=""center""><i>(Claude Coats, seated center, with (L to R) John Hench, Mary Blair and Walt Disney) </i></p>
<p>Coats started at the Disney Studios in the background department, working on Mickey and Pluto cartoons. A watershed moment came with his color styling and naturalistic backgrounds for <i>The Old Mill</i> (1937), which featured breakthrough techniques in mood, lighting and color, and the use of the new Multiplane camera, creating what he described as, “the emotional response that comes from a background painting.” His star rose quickly in Walt’s eyes, and he was asked to develop the styling for the opening Wishing Well sequence in <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</i></p>

<p>With the completion of <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>, Walt Disney asked Claude Coats to be part of the team to design Disneyland. This would begin what Coats would call, “my second Disney career,” as he joined an elite group of artists and engineers working with and on Walt's vision for Disneyland. This book will cover those astonishing first fifteen (15) years of the meteoric rise of the original theme park. </p>

<p><i>(Claude Coats painting the scenic flats, in the special effects building on the studio back lot, for the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride attraction at Disneyland, 1955) </i></p>
<p>With his architectural training and ability to visualize dimensionally, Claude Coats went on to design some of the most beloved theme park attractions including the original <i>Pirates of the Caribbean </i>and the <i>Haunted Mansion</i>. He was known for designing an attraction from the point-of-view of the guest by creating a sense of place that allowed the guest to be part of the story. As Marty Sklar, former head of Walt Disney Imagineering, observed; “Walt saw how Claude could translate his talent into three dimensions, and not everybody could do that. Understanding how things were going to work dimensionally helped him create these immersive environments.”*</p>

<p>Aside from his contribution to attractions in the original Disneyland theme park, Claude Coats was a key player in the 1964 World’s Fair in New York. He spearheaded the concepts for the <i>Ford Magic Skyway, the GE Carousel of Progress</i>, and the now world famous <i>It’s a Small World </i>attractions. Versions of these and many other iconic attractions that Claude Coats was involved with designing during those pivotal first decades of Disneyland are now permanent fixtures at the Disney theme parks around the world. <strong><i>Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond</i></strong> will explain in detail the behind-the-scenes stories and anecdotes that make many of these Disneyland attractions iconic. </p>

<p>Claude Coats was one of the chief Imagineers involved in the <i>Haunted Mansion</i>, which was the first new major attraction built after Walt passed away in 1966. Claude Coats is best known for creating the spooky, moody atmosphere in the first half of the ride as well as making this a much more scary experience.

</div></div>","This campaign is for pre-ordering the book, Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond. We know there are thousands of readers who want this book, which chronicles Claude Coats' contributions to the creation of Disneyland with Walt Disney.
This book will showcase Claude Coats' key innovations in immersive ride design, and his pioneering use of new technologies and visual methods that still influence theme park experiences today. Here is your chance to own a First Edition of what will be the prize of any Disney collection with its behind-the-scenes text, lush production value and rare, never-before-seen artwork and photos. Supported with the full cooperation of the Claude Coats estate and family, pre-ordering this book is your opportunity to join with us in documenting the legacy of a major creative force in the annals of the Disney universe. This is your chance to make history! 

(The original Toad Hall attraction mural painted by Claude Coats) 
Over the last two years, I have worked closely with Claude Coats' son Alan Coats, also an Imagineer, to get a book published about his father through traditional publishing houses. Traditional publishers rely on sales teams to make the decisions on which books get published., so, it's not a surprise that we have been met with “he doesn’t have enough name recognition” from the various  publishers that the project has been pitched to. This has been frustrating to us both because we know that there are thousands of Disney fans and theme park enthusiasts who do know who Claude Coats is and what his stellar accomplishments are in Disney animation and at Disney Theme Parks worldwide. That is why we have decided to pitch to you, the fans and enthusiasts, on pre-ordering Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond, which we believe will show that this is a story that is worth telling. We hope that you will agree as well.

(Claude Coats and Yale Gracey with Adventure Thru Inner Space model.)
Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond is the story of artist and designer Claude Coats who, for more than half a century, was one of the most prolific creative talents at The Walt Disney Company and, arguably, the most accomplished. An unpretentious man of strapping stature, Claude was the artist behind some of the most stunning backgrounds produced at the Disney studio during the Golden Age of animation before becoming one of the eighteen founding members, handed-picked by Walt Disney, to start the fabled WED Enterprises—now known as Walt Disney Imagineering.
                  
(Pinocchio backgrounds painted by Claude Coats)
For the first time ever, this all-inclusive book will focus on one of the most revered artists who successfully crossed over from the animation department to become one of the original Imagineers. Working side by side with Walt Disney, Claude Coats was a major influence in not only creating the first theme park, but a new form of creativity called Imagineering that would forever change the worlds of global entertainment, technology, architecture and popular culture.

(Claude Coats, seated center, with (L to R) John Hench, Mary Blair and Walt Disney) 
Coats started at the Disney Studios in the background department, working on Mickey and Pluto cartoons. A watershed moment came with his color styling and naturalistic backgrounds for The Old Mill (1937), which featured breakthrough techniques in mood, lighting and color, and the use of the new Multiplane camera, creating what he described as, “the emotional response that comes from a background painting.” His star rose quickly in Walt’s eyes, and he was asked to develop the styling for the opening Wishing Well sequence in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

(Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, background and overlay by Claude Coats) 
With the completion of Lady and the Tramp, Walt Disney asked Claude Coats to be part of the team to design Disneyland. This would begin what Coats would call, “my second Disney career,” as he joined an elite group of artists and engineers working with and on Walt's vision for Disneyland. This book will cover those astonishing first fifteen (15) years of the meteoric rise of the original theme park. 

(Claude Coats painting the scenic flats, in the special effects building on the studio back lot, for the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride attraction at Disneyland, 1955) 
With his architectural training and ability to visualize dimensionally, Claude Coats went on to design some of the most beloved theme park attractions including the original Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion. He was known for designing an attraction from the point-of-view of the guest by creating a sense of place that allowed the guest to be part of the story. As Marty Sklar, former head of Walt Disney Imagineering, observed; “Walt saw how Claude could translate his talent into three dimensions, and not everybody could do that. Understanding how things were going to work dimensionally helped him create these immersive environments.”*
*(Dave Bossert & Alan Coats did an extensive interview with Marty Sklar about Claude Coats’ career, one of the last known interviews with Marty before he passed away on July 27, 2017. )

(Claude Coats airbrushing the Pirates attraction model.) 
Aside from his contribution to attractions in the original Disneyland theme park, Claude Coats was a key player in the 1964 World’s Fair in New York. He spearheaded the concepts for the Ford Magic Skyway, the GE Carousel of Progress, and the now world famous It’s a Small World attractions. Versions of these and many other iconic attractions that Claude Coats was involved with designing during those pivotal first decades of Disneyland are now permanent fixtures at the Disney theme parks around the world. Walt Disney’s Imagineer Claude Coats—The Making of Disneyland: From Toad Hall to the Haunted Mansion and Beyond will explain in detail the behind-the-scenes stories and anecdotes that make many of these Disneyland attractions iconic. 

(Claude Coats with Walt Disney discussing Primeval World, 1966)
Claude Coats was one of the chief Imagineers involved in the Haunted Mansion, which was the first new major attraction built after Walt passed away in 1966. Claude Coats is best known for creating the spooky, moody atmosphere in the first half of the ride as well as making this a much more scary experience. The original Haunted Mansion at Disneyland is a fan favorite at Halloween with Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas overlay. Variations of the Haunted Mansion are still one of the seminal attractions at the Disney parks worldwide today.

<p>The New Gods are pointing the finger at each other. They each believe the other gods have unleashed the horror on Babylon. The authorities are powerless to stop them. This leaves Team Black Watch with only one option. </p>

A mysterious hacker contacts Zen Tan with a powerful proposition: carry out a heist, and he will earn a friend for life. 
The catch is, the target of the heist is the Void Collective. A hive mind that will know when its possessions have been stolen. And it will react with extreme violence.
If anyone can do this, it's Zen and Kayla. But this job may just take them to the brink of destruction. 
Babylon Red
A voracious predator haunts the waterways of Babylon. Everywhere it goes, it abducts the hapless and the unwary, and leaves witnesses shaken to the depths of their souls. With every hunt, it grows even more powerful. 
The New Gods are pointing the finger at each other. They each believe the other gods have unleashed the horror on Babylon. The authorities are powerless to stop them. This leaves Team Black Watch with only one option. 
Destroy the monster before the New Gods destroy Babylon. 
And without being destroyed in turn. 
A tall order, even for the most formidable operators in the nation. But this time, they have an edge.
This time, they have Yuri Yamamoto. 
This last story is exclusive to this collection. 
BABYLON RED is a massive tome. Presently the entire manuscript runs to 199000 words. Such a huge book would be impossible for most people to publish.
But with your help, it can become a reality. 
 
The Plan

I am Singapore's first Hugo and Dragon Award nominated author. With three successful crowdfunded campaigns and 14 published novels under my belt, I have the experience and the skills to see this project through. 
This campaign aims to cover the costs of publishing BABYLON RED. Contributions will go towards covering the costs of production, especially the cover art and formatting.
By backing this project, you ensure its success. You show the world that you value works that place you as their top priority. You support the indies who work for you, not the gatekeepers who value only their bottom line. 
Best of all, you will receive this book at least two weeks ahead of the market!
The campaign will run for 30 days. In July, the artist will get to work. By September, I plan to deliver the completed book to all backers. 
BABYLON RED is guerilla warfare against eldritch abominations and their cultists, fought with high-powered railguns, cyberwarfare tools, and cold steel. 
Back the project now, and boost the signal to your fellow SFF readers!

Risks & Challenges

Minimal.
The manuscript is complete. The artist has been booked. The formatter is ready to go.
The only major challenge is a sudden emergency that would take the artist and/or formatter out of action. In that unlikely event, I have alternates on standby. 
With my record of completed projects, you can rest assured that your money will go to good use.

Upon her return to the States, she became a minor celebrity, was interviewed by Barbara Walters, and even appeared on the Johnny Carson show with her pet anteater Clovis in tow.

Her story spans the better part of the 20th century, including scenes from Jean’s childhood in Upper West Side Manhattan, her life as an ingénue modeling for Paris Vogue, the legendary “Party of the Century” on the Grand Canal in Venice, and her unusual alliance with the Italian count she convinced to take her along on a diamond hunting expedition in the Venezuelan jungle.After that first expedition, Jean returned to her native New York for a different type of adventure, hobnobbing with the likes of George Plimpton, Norman Mailer, Andrew Wyeth, and Margaret Mead, amongst other celebrities, luminaries, and Beat Generation freethinkers of the 1960s.But the jungle activated something so powerful in Jean, she had to go back and discover what only the pristine rainforest and its inhabitants could reveal. Upon her return to the States, she became a minor celebrity, was interviewed by Barbara Walters, and even appeared on the Johnny Carson show with her pet anteater Clovis in tow. Ten years later, after her fifth and final trip to the Amazon, Jean wrote The Continuum Concept, her now classic treatise on human nature, which led to her decades-long career as a trusted advisor and mentor to parents around the world.How Jean Liedloff’s Fascination with the Jungle Led to Her Breakthrough: The Continuum Concept
“If the world could be saved by a book, this just might be the book.”John Holt, author of How Children Learn
Holt was referring to Jean’s 1975 masterpiece, The Continuum Concept, which has been translated into 20 languages, inspiring hundreds of thousands of mothers around the world to trust what their culture taught them to deny: the ancient feminine wisdom in their very bones.The revolutionary ideas in Jean’s book (many of which are now common knowledge), grew out of informal observations while she lived among the indigenous tribes of the Amazon back in the 1950s and 60s. The book soon became the go-to resource for conscious parents as continuum-informed parenting styles came into vogue.It’s through her book that I met Jean decades ago and began a relationship that started with her in a mentoring role. Over the years, it blossomed into an enduring friendship which, though often challenging, lasted to her final days. While on her deathbed, Jean honored me with an invitation to write her biography. It was the assignment of a lifetime.After eight years of hard work, the biography is now complete!Jungle Jean captures the essence of Jean’s phenomenal life story and the natural parenting movement inspired by her book, including real-life stories — never before published — that bring a deeper understanding of continuum parenting principles and the woman who brought them to light.Countless parents have said things like, “After reading Jean’s book, I threw all the other parenting manuals away.” This biography will have a similar impact. A captivating adventure story full of psychological insights, Jungle Jean presents Liedloff’s ideas in a way that will make them more accessible to the Millennial, Gen Z, and Alpha-Generation parents who will carry the continuum concept fully into the 21st century.
Jungle Jean Has Already Been Endorsed by Five New York Times Bestselling Authors!“Jungle Jean ... shows how we can make the journey back to a society characterized by cooperation and joy.”— Gloria Steinem, The Revolution Within
“The principles of intuitive parenting Jean Liedloff witnessed in the Amazon rainforest and wrote about in The Continuum Concept are valued worldwide. This riveting read gives parents tools to raise more competent and confident children.— Dr. William Sears, The Attachment Parenting Book
“A refreshing view of human nature. Jungle Jean shows that we truly are designed to be happy.”— Marcie Shimoff, Happy for No Reason
“A deeply moving story told by a master storyteller... Jungle Jean offers profound insights into the source of well-being.”— Deborah King, Truth Heals
“This is an important life-changing book, a juicy transformative biography of a pioneer and adventurer told by a fearless friend who reveals the shared wounds of the modern-day human condition. You may come for the storytelling, but you'll leave with compassionate understanding for yourself and others. Highly recommended.”— Arielle Ford, The Soulmate Secret
As word gets out, the endorsements keep rolling in, most recently from bestselling authors Riane Eisler (The Chalice and the Blade) and Jean Houston (The Possible Human), and Grammy winner Kenny Loggins (Danny's Song) is reading the book now!It’s time to publish Jean’s biography and breathe new life into the parenting practices she inspired, now backed by scientific research, including studies at the University of Notre Dame, as well as neuro-imaging studies of what Dr. William Sears calls the “mommy brain.”
Jungle Jean Goes Beyond Childrearing and Offers a Vital, Uplifting Message for Our TimesJean’s experiences while living in the jungle among indigenous people caused her to question our culture’s basic assumptions about human nature — assumptions that have never been more devastating than they are right now. The startling conclusion Jean arrived at — that we are innately cooperative and designed to be happy — carries a vital, uplifting message for our time.This book speaks to people from all walks of life. Readers of personal growth books will be moved by powerful insights on how we humans can create secure, high-functioning relationships. All who crave enduring, harmonious love-bonds with other human beings will be deeply touched by Jean’s story.Imagine what the world would look like if the whole of humanity truly understood our essential, inbuilt needs. And that when those needs are met, we grow into happy, cooperative people who live in harmony with others and have the clarity of mind and heart to solve our biggest problems. This is what John Holt meant when he said Jean’s ideas could save the world.A Renaissance for The Continuum Concept
Join this campaign and help us carry on Jean’s legacy. Her biography is an amazing story by itself — sure to entertain, fascinate, and rock the worlds of those who read it. Add to that Jungle Jean’s potential to introduce future generations to her crucial insights — and to deepen the understanding of those already in the know — and we have an opportunity too powerful to ignore!So many people feel helpless to do anything about the state of the world. But each human baby has a unique genius that wants to flower and be expressed in service to the world. Clearly, if we’re going to “save the world” we need a whole generation of geniuses right now.I feel blessed to have been given a high-impact item on my to-do list. But I can’t do it without YOU. Supporting this campaign is your YES vote for humanity, for the continuation of our species on this beautiful blue-green planet.NOTE: To see detailed descriptions of the “perks” for campaign contributors click or tap once on each perk listed.Our Funding GoalsMission-critical goal: $48kCover design and printing costs along with the expert consulting and comprehensive publicity campaign that will help Jungle Jean break through all the noise and get noticed by those who will benefit the most.Stretch goal: $68kAn additional $20,000 will make it possible to produce and publish the audio book, fund the podcast production and launch, and retain a social media expert for ongoing marketing.Big Hairy Audacious goal: $98kWith another $30,000, we can extend our multifaceted marketing strategy for up to six additional months.

<p><strong><i>Stuka - The Doctrine of the German Dive-Bomber </i></strong>includes 8 original Luftwaffe documents translated into English, alongside introductory essays that provide additional information and context. These documents have been carefully curated and gathered from various archives to provide you with the best foundation on the tactics, doctrine, organization, training and operational experience with the Junkers Ju 87 dive-bomber. And the best part is, as far as we can tell, these documents have <u>never been published like this before</u>! These documents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A<strong> full organizational breakdown of a </strong><i><strong>Sturzkampfgeschwader<i> </i></strong><i>(Dive-Bomber Group), </i></i>giving a complete look at the structure of a unit. This is accompanied with a visualization chart for quick reference that reflects a full <i>Geschwader</i><i> (Group)</i> from the individual over to the complete unit.</li>
<li>The <strong>original training manual on how to dive-bomb with the Junkers Ju 87,</strong> illustrated with more than a dozen graphs and visualizations that provide you with a fantastic representation of the given examples.</li>
<li>A full <strong>original description of the tasks and roles of dive-bombers in the Luftwaffe</strong>, giving you the full picture on how the Germans conceptualized the role of the Junkers Ju 87 during World War 2.</li>
<li>Ju 87s against motorized columns - how does this work? Look no further than the <strong>pamphlet on the use of dive-bomber units against motorized ground forces</strong>, foreshadowing the use of the Ju 87 in the campaigns against Poland, France and the Soviet Union.</li>
<li>Night bombing in the Ju 87? Yes, it's possible as the notice on the <strong>special guidelines on night dive-bombing with the Ju 87</strong> will show!</li>
<li>and <i><strong>much more</strong></i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These documents will allow you not only to read how the Luftwaffe planned to use the Ju 87, but you will also discover the experiences gained in the actual operations, right out of the mouth (or rather, typewriter) of the Luftwaffe.</p>

And the best part is, as far as we can tell, these documents have never been published like this before! These documents include:

A full organizational breakdown of a Sturzkampfgeschwader (Dive-Bomber Group), giving a complete look at the structure of a unit. This is accompanied with a visualization chart for quick reference that reflects a full Geschwader (Group) from the individual over to the complete unit.
The original training manual on how to dive-bomb with the Junkers Ju 87, illustrated with more than a dozen graphs and visualizations that provide you with a fantastic representation of the given examples.
A full original description of the tasks and roles of dive-bombers in the Luftwaffe, giving you the full picture on how the Germans conceptualized the role of the Junkers Ju 87 during World War 2.
Ju 87s against motorized columns - how does this work? Look no further than the pamphlet on the use of dive-bomber units against motorized ground forces, foreshadowing the use of the Ju 87 in the campaigns against Poland, France and the Soviet Union.
Night bombing in the Ju 87? Yes, it's possible as the notice on the special guidelines on night dive-bombing with the Ju 87 will show!
and much more.

 
These documents will allow you not only to read how the Luftwaffe planned to use the Ju 87, but you will also discover the experiences gained in the actual operations, right out of the mouth (or rather, typewriter) of the Luftwaffe.
Stretch goals
Getting this project beyond the minimal funding will allow us to make it even better. With more support, we will be able to upgrade this book by including extra content into the final print.


Current progress
As with our previous projects, we present this project to you after having already invested considerable time and effort into it. As such, you are not backing a product that has yet to be made.
The next steps are:

Finalize short essays providing additional information on relevant documents.
Finish the translation into the final annotated English text.
Complete the formatting and editing of the manuscript.
Order test prints to check the product.
Getting it printed, (and signed for signed copies) and sent to you.

 
The Team & Vision

Christoph Bergs (Military Aviation History) and Bernhard Kast (Military History Visualized)
We are both native German speakers and have worked professionally in English for over five years, continuously translating and exploring German original documents in our daily work. Our vision is to facilitate better access to German primary sources from World War 2 so as to improve our understanding of this critical time in history.
Our past projects were The German Army Regulation 470/7 - The Medium Tank Company and the German Army Pamphlet 25a/16: The Assault Platoon of the Grenadier-Company. Both followed this vision and were also successfully crowdfunded by your support.
As the third release in the series, Stuka - The Doctrine of the German Dive-Bomber we want to do even better, further refining the formula and giving you a new experience in getting down into the very details of the Luftwaffe's own theories and pratical use of one of the most famous aircraft from World War 2.


Shipping
We are happy to announce that shipping is, as usual, included in the final price and that no additional charges are put in place by us for you to receive your book. Based on our previous experiences, we have optimised our printing and shipping processes, ensuring that your orders will be handled promptly and efficiently.
Impact of Covid-19: In our last campaign, Covid-19 did have an unexpected impact on production and shipment costs. We did not roll any additional costs on our supporters since this would have been unfair. For this campaign, we do need to take into account these new additional costs. As such the fraction of the cost that was covering shipping has increased to compensate for these new fees.
Our printer produces our books in multiple countries (US & EU). As such it is unlikely that the majority of supporters will be paying additional fees for customs fees, import duties, VAT, or other related charges. While this seems to not have impacted supporters in our previous campaigns, please be aware that we do not cover these additional charges, so supporters will be responsible for paying these if they occur.Risks & ChallengesThis is our third major translation project. We have previously successfully translated, crowdfunded and published the German Army Regulation 470/7 - The Medium Tank Company from 1941, and the German Army Pamphlet 25a/16: The Assault Platoon of the Grenadier-Company from 1944. We have built up practical knowledge and a keen understanding in how to complete such a project and are supported by experts, proof-readers and a professional fulfillment partner. Much of what we know now is experience gained from analyzing our previous campaigns and learning from them.In our last project, Covid-19 did impact the shipping of our books with associated delays in both production, signing and shipping. We have taken steps to avoid having to contend with the same challenges again by optimising our timelines for production and fulfillment to reflect the changed circumstances. While it remains possible that Covid-19 could impact the production and shipping timelines of our book, we have taken appropriate measures in order to minimize the risks. Likewise, we have adapted the travel requirements for our signed copies in order to limit the risks of postponing shipments as it is our intention to sign every copy by hand. Should this not be possible due to travel restrictions, an alternative solution will be used by which a high-quality signed certificate will be added to each signed hardcover order.With this project, the work is moving into the finalization phase as such this is not a speculative crowdfunder. The majority of the manuscript, the chapters and visualizations are completed and the book is on schedule.",7.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>About The Crimson Gods</h3>
<p><i>""Something ancient this way comes...""</i></p>
<p>The last king of Aahsgoth abdicated his crown in favor of a ruling council. His children that were born royalty are no longer sure where they fit in this world. On the edge of political fallout, whispers of the past are starting to resurface.</p>
<p>With hundreds of noble and lesser houses that, as written, originated from twelve clans that became the kingdoms themselves, some say Aahsgoth was ruled by the gods themselves in a more magickal time. The Order Of Preceptors however believe most of these are simply fables  or the inventions of singers to glorify a particular king or queen that held their favor. However things are coming to pass that perhaps point to a deeper mystery and a past they may not fully understand.</p>

Don’t take our word for it.

 

THE STORIES
Designed as a read-aloud book, the stories are a perfect length for bedtime or classroom reading - just a couple pages.

Each story in Brilliantly Dyslexic features a portrait by a different artist. The uniqueness of each story is amplified by the uniqueness of the art.

PERSPECTIVES FROM KIDS & TEENS 
A section dedicated to sharing experiences, strengths, and advice from dyslexic learners, including kids and teens.
DYSLEXIA BASICS: WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW
We’ve included a section with what everyone needs to know about dyslexia. We’ve got the basics covered - What is it? Where does it come from? Everything is explained in a way that's approachable and engaging for all.
 


 


 

Dyslexia doesn’t show up much in children’s stories. This is a problem…because we all need stories that make us feel seen. When we find those stories, it’s powerful. In the space of three pages, we see ourselves and our lives differently. Maybe it’s possible to do that thing I’ve secretly been dreaming of. Perhaps it won’t always be this hard. Maybe being dyslexic isn’t just an OK way to be…maybe it could be a fantastic way to be.
If you're a kid who struggles to read and write, it’s a HUGE deal to you. And, you need to see that feels-like-it-defines-my-whole-life thing reflected in the world in a positive way. That’s what Brilliantly Dyslexic is about.

 

This is me, Liz, and Quinn, my brilliant + dyslexic daughter. We created Brilliantly Dyslexic.

Struggling with reading and writing, Quinn often felt like she didn’t measure up compared to her classmates. When I started telling her about some successful people with dyslexia, she lit up. She was surprised. How could it be that someone could be both dyslexic and ‘smart’? The more I shared with her, the more her perspective seemed to shift. Perhaps her difficulties weren’t meant to be her whole story after all.
While there is a lot of information online about amazing people with dyslexia, we couldn’t find something designed for children. So, I started writing. We read the stories at bedtime, and Quinn kept asking for more.
Seeing the impact these stories had on my daughter and me, I began to wonder: What if this situation isn’t unique for us? What if we made this a book for the many children and parents who are looking for stories that they can find themselves in?
After 2 years of writing, editing, and working with illustrators, we can’t wait to get this book into your hands.
 

We’ve obsessed about the details from the art to the high quality production finish. You’re going to be proud to have this on your bookshelf / your nightstand / in your classroom.

<h3>Welcome to Aahsgoth!</h3>
<p>Thank you for stopping by the campaign to fund my debut fantasy novel, <strong>The Crimson Gods</strong>!</p>
<p>My name is Chris, and I am an indie author that decided to create my own world to explore and I  invite you to come on this journey with me. I have been a YouTuber for the past 5 (almost 6 years) covering TV/Movies such as Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, etc. on my channel <a href=""https://youtube.com/smokescreenvids1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SmokeScreen</a>.</p>
<p>While I still enjoy talking to the outstanding community on these topics, I have been writing for the past two years on what I hope is a new world people will enjoy with what I believe is an intriguing story. I now also provide writing tips videos and blog posts on Wednesdays in addition to still covering popular shows and live streams. Sign up to my <a href=""https://chrismchristian.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">newsletter here</a> for updates!</p>
<h3>About The Crimson Gods</h3>
<p>""<i>Something ancient this way comes...</i>""</p>
<p>The last king of Aahsgoth abdicated his crown in favor of a ruling council. His children that were born royalty are no longer sure where they fit in this world. On the edge of political fallout, whispers of the past are starting to resurface.</p>
<p>With hundreds of noble and lesser houses that, as written, originated from twelve clans that became the kingdoms themselves, some say Aahsgoth was ruled by the gods themselves in a more magickal time. The Order Of Preceptors however believe most of these are simply fables  or the inventions of singers to glorify a particular king or queen that held their favor. However things are coming to pass that perhaps point to a deeper mystery and a past they may not fully understand.</p>

As I progressed to high school and was accepted into a charter program centered around engineering, I started using mechanical pencils even more.  Build quality and reliability became more important.  I switched to using Pentel p20x series pencils for their robust lead advance mechanism.</p><p>Throughout the years since, I’ve mainly stuck to using the Pentels I had used back in high school.  The build quality of the mechanism was very high quality, but the cheap feeling of the barrel assembly was starting to become a turn off.  I had started a job in a more demanding environment that really required a higher quality writing implement.</p><p>I tried using some full metal versions from the likes of Rotring and Pilot, and while I liked parts of both designs, I felt it was time to take things I liked from all of the mechanical pencils I had tried over the years and build my own.</p><p>As a machinist doing technical drawings, I knew I preferred a hex barrel to keep the pencil from rolling.  An all metal body was a must as well.  I experimented with different grip sections including different knurled patterns, as well as rounded sections and cutouts.</p><p>For the internal mechanism, I chose to use my old reliable Pentel p20x series. First released in 1970, the mechanism has proven to be robust and reliable.</p><p>By donating to this campaign, not only will you be receiving a beautiful mechanical pencil, but you'll be helping me to keep doing what I love; machining and making  new things!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607056075/zo1lnh56przb0xwws2qo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><b>Fabrication </b><strong>process:</strong></p><p>I start off with 6ft of hexagonal stock and cut each piece to individual pencil length on a bandsaw.  The individual pieces are then faced square in my lathe and center drilled on each end.  The grip pattern is then cut in.  Finally, the body is bored to the correct size.  Post processing is done on a variety of belt and disc sanders to clean up any burrs and provide an even finish.  If the optional powder coating is selected, depending on what is required, the powder is baked on either before or after machining.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Dimensions and weight:</strong></p><p>For the basic pencil, overall length (tip to cap) is ~142.5mm / 5.6” . The hexagonal part of the body is ~7.86mm / 5/16” across the flats. The diameter of the round knurled grips is ~7.8mm / 5/16”.  Custom dimensions (both width and height) are available via special order.  Check the FAQ for info on how to get in touch with me.</p><p>Raw pencils have the following weights:</p><ul>

Stand out features include a hand machined all metal body, six different grip styles, choice of lead size, finish / material / color, and more! The intersection of form and function.The backstory:I’ve been a fan of mechanical pencils since first using them in middle school.  Being young, I started off like most people with a basic Bic or Papermate. As I progressed to high school and was accepted into a charter program centered around engineering, I started using mechanical pencils even more.  Build quality and reliability became more important.  I switched to using Pentel p20x series pencils for their robust lead advance mechanism.Throughout the years since, I’ve mainly stuck to using the Pentels I had used back in high school.  The build quality of the mechanism was very high quality, but the cheap feeling of the barrel assembly was starting to become a turn off.  I had started a job in a more demanding environment that really required a higher quality writing implement.I tried using some full metal versions from the likes of Rotring and Pilot, and while I liked parts of both designs, I felt it was time to take things I liked from all of the mechanical pencils I had tried over the years and build my own.As a machinist doing technical drawings, I knew I preferred a hex barrel to keep the pencil from rolling.  An all metal body was a must as well.  I experimented with different grip sections including different knurled patterns, as well as rounded sections and cutouts.For the internal mechanism, I chose to use my old reliable Pentel p20x series. First released in 1970, the mechanism has proven to be robust and reliable.By donating to this campaign, not only will you be receiving a beautiful mechanical pencil, but you'll be helping me to keep doing what I love; machining and making  new things!Fabrication process:I start off with 6ft of hexagonal stock and cut each piece to individual pencil length on a bandsaw.  The individual pieces are then faced square in my lathe and center drilled on each end.  The grip pattern is then cut in.  Finally, the body is bored to the correct size.  Post processing is done on a variety of belt and disc sanders to clean up any burrs and provide an even finish.  If the optional powder coating is selected, depending on what is required, the powder is baked on either before or after machining. Dimensions and weight:For the basic pencil, overall length (tip to cap) is ~142.5mm / 5.6” . The hexagonal part of the body is ~7.86mm / 5/16” across the flats. The diameter of the round knurled grips is ~7.8mm / 5/16”.  Custom dimensions (both width and height) are available via special order.  Check the FAQ for info on how to get in touch with me.Raw pencils have the following weights:
Aluminium 13g
Brass 27g
Grip styles:So, what am I offering?  Six different styles of grip in the standard configuration, with each grip style being offered at different perk levels.  (Grip options can be combined via special order)The most basic design is the straight hex barrel with a chamfered edge on both ends.  (all designs use chamfered edges on both the top and bottom of the barrel) Simple, clean, and the heaviest option available.Next up is the hex to a round grip profile, for those who prefer a round grip section that won’t bite into their fingers.  This also allows the user to more easily rotate the pencil to any degree to use the lead in any desired way.Then we have the ribbed hex.  This grip style features evenly spaced ribs cut into the hex grip section for a unique design and better grip.
Finally we come to our last group of grip options.  Knurling!  Knurling is offered in three different levels to suit the end user.:
 A fine version featuring small tight knurling and providing a good purchase while not biting into the fingers.  This is the nearest to the classic mechanical pencil knurling.
The middle of the road option is a medium knurl offering more purchase.  The pattern of the knurl is more easily observed and provides a more substantial grip surface.And lastly, a coarse version (community dubbed gnarly knurl).  This version features large diamond shaped points pretty much guaranteeing a no slip grip no matter the circumstances. More customization – barrel material, powder coating,  lead size, tip material, lead sleeve length:Two choices of body material are available:  6061 aircraft grade aluminum and brass. The brass will develop a patina over time and is the heavier of the two.  However, powder coating is available as an option on both materials to add color and protection along with  scratch resistance.The standard powder coating is a slightly textured near matte black.  Custom colors are available as an extra cost option, above the standard black coating.Thanks to the use of pentel p20x internals, I’m able to offer 4 different lead sizes at this time.
0.3mm (extra charge)
0.5mm
0.7mm
0.9mm (extra charge)
The tip and eraser cap can also be powder coated black for a stealth look.  As another option, the tip can also be had in brass.Some people prefer the 2mm short lead sleeve that was only found on the earliest model p20x's, as compared to the 5mm sleeve on all other models.  I am able to offer the 2mm sleeve on all lead sizes.Packaging:Every pencil is packed in an elegant cardboard carton that can be recycled if not needed.  Each box is hand numbered with your pencils limited production number as well.Eraser:Every pencil comes with a standard Pentel p20x series eraser under the cap to correct mistakes. Updates:I will continue to post updates as the campaign continues, and after it has ended with build progress etc. Additional Info:

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>In 2019, a queer voice actor from Pittsburgh, Sam Logsdon, had an idea- with so many authors and artists living in one area, there should be more opportunities for collaboration. They decided to gather their friends and acquaintances and asked how to turn raw talent into something <i>bigger</i>. Realizing that promoting local artists was merely a starting point, the idea for <strong>Phoenix of Alexandria</strong> was developed! It's going to be more than just another publishing company: PoA is a queer-led, queer-focused business that plans to amplify voices in the community. Along with co-founder, Dani Mauroni, a team of editors, and dedicated contributors, Phoenix of Alexandria has been able to create their first publication: <strong>Rivets</strong>! This is a Pittsburgh-born literary collection (with a few non-local contributions) that highlights the talent of queer authors and visual artists. This fundraiser is going to take PoA to it's LLC status, so we can start working for the queer arts community! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This fundraiser is going to be used for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our LLC</li>
<li>Printing Costs</li>
<li>Compensation for Contributors</li>
<li>Our Logo (yes, the artist who made our logo believes in our company so much that he agreed to complete the logo and wait for payment!)</li>
<li>Compensation for the Editors</li>
<li>Upgrading Storage to Google Drive (we go through a lot of data)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we raise enough money, we would use it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lawyer/ Business Contracting fees </li>
<li>Funds for the second issue</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your contribution you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital copy of Rivets</li>
<li>Physical copy of Rivets</li>
<li>USB Drive with Phoenix of Alexandria logo</li>
<li>Bookmark and Tote Bag with Phoenix of Alexandria logo (made by Pittsburgh's very own Kween Tees!)</li>
<li>Access to Meet and Greet with Founders and Editors</li>
</ul>
<p>If we make less than our goal, the funds will be use to compensate contributors and the logo artist first, then depending on how much we raise, printing costs and the LLC. We want to do right by the folks who support us, so if nothing else we want to make sure they are compensated for their hard work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lee and Low Books published a study regarding diversity in publishing. While they noted the changes publishing has gone through since 2015 and the outside influence in politics and media, they still made an effort to show why more diversity is needed. Using the 2019 statistics, these are trends in the publishing industry overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Race: 76% White/Caucasian, 7% AAPI, 6% Latinx, 5% Black, and less than 1% Native American </li>
<li>Gender: 74% Cis Women, 23% Cis Men, 1% Non-binary/GNC, and less than 1% each Trans Women, Trans Men, and Intersex.</li>
<li>Orientation: 81% identify as heterosexual</li>
<li>Disability: only 11% of the industry reported having a disability</li>
</ul>
<p>Representation matters - the people working on the publication and distribution of books influence the industry. Diversity in publishing= diversity in stories. Phoenix of Alexandria is going to prioritize BIPOC and Queer voices, because those are the voices who need amplified. The more platforms disabled, queer, and non-white writers and artists have, the more exposure their stories have, which helps to remove stigma and reinforce empathy.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are starting this venture with limited resources. We are relying on this campaign to fund our LLC, first issue costs, and potentially have a down payment for future issues. However, since we are a queer-focused company, we know the power of the community. We know that no matter what we accomplish, it'll be because our fellow queers and allies. If, for whatever reason, we don't raise enough money for a physical print, we will give you at least a digital copy. The artists and authors who made Rivets the fantastic literary collection it is deserve to be recognized in whatever compacity. And you deserve recognition for your contribution to our success. Regardless of the outcome of this campaign, we are proud of all the people who believed in this project. We are proud so many people advocate for a more diverse landscape in publishing.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is Home Sweet Homes?</h2>
<p><a href=""https://homesweethomesjournal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Home Sweet Homes</a> is a revolutionary and unique tool designed to elevate the way you co-parent by bridging the gap between transitions and focusing on supporting the person who needs it the most, your child. It thoughtfully combines the benefits of a planner and journal into one physical book, which stays with your child as they go back and forth between their two homes. </p>
<p>This tool has been created to help you, your co-parent, and your child through the challenges stemming from a separation or divorce which often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting your child's mental and emotional wellbeing</li>
<li>Feelings of disconnect amongst parent-child and co-parents </li>
<li>Lack of continuity between transitions</li>
<li>Limited or inconsistent schedule transparency and accessibility (for child)</li>
<li>Missing out on your child’s day to day life </li>
</ul>
<p>Home Sweet Homes prioritizes the needs of your child and encourages him or her to feel supported amidst this life change. Inside, you’ll find monthly and weekly calendar spreads, empowering affirmations, tandem child/parent reflections and writing prompts, weekly challenges, activity pages, free space for creativity, an emergency contacts section, and more.</p>
<p>In its entirety, Home Sweet Homes is a unique reference guide, teaching tool, and touching memory book rolled in one.<br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why I Created Home Sweet Homes</h2>
<p>After my son's dad and I separated, I felt stressed, anxious, and worried witnessing my son having to adjust to the constant back and forth between homes. And so, I searched everywhere for any tools, products, or solutions that could help make things easier, but didn't find anything that existed.  I tried co-parenting apps, and although they were helpful for adults, it wasn't a solution that directly involved children.</p>
<p>One day, I was at a dollar store and came across a $2 planner.  I actually debated on whether I should buy it! On the days I had my son, I started writing in a summary of our day then passed it along to my son's dad where he would do the same. When my son came back home with the planner, it was not just nice, but extremely helpful knowing what they had been up to. I started involving my son more in the process, helping him use the calendar to see his schedule and writing in our daily summary together.</p>
<p>It evolved to become a back-and-forth journal and planner which was so useful for all three of us that I wanted to create and design one specifically to help co-parents and their children facing the same problems we experienced. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619495635/fpa1uvqyesle2qtiobhc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Why am I Running a Crowdfunding Campaign?</h2>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to fund an initial print run of Home Sweet Homes. This hardcover book is filled with 274 full-color pages.  Having Home Sweet Homes be entirely in color was extremely important to me as I want children to feel joy and happiness when using this tool, in the midst of their often difficult and stressful circumstances of living in two homes. </p>
<p>Printing in color is expensive but for a book this length, you can only imagine what those costs might be! In addition to being a single mom, I'm also currently unemployed, I was laid off at the end of 2019 and by March 2020, COVID-19 hit and suddenly nobody was hiring!</p>
<p>Mid-2020, I consciously decided to hold off my job search and spent the second half of the year designing and creating Home Sweet Homes. That said, crowdfunding gives me a way to reduce my financial risk. Plus, it is also a fun and exciting way for me to get the word out about this one-of-a-kind tool!<br/> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How to Use</h2>
<p>The Home Sweet Homes journal and planner is a tool that stays with your child. It is recommeded for children between ages 4 to 10. The basic premise is that each daily journal entry is to be filled by the parent or caregiver who has primary physical custody or your child if they are able to write.</p>
<p>When it’s time for your child to transition homes, make sure the journal goes with him/her. Your co-parent or child will then fill out the journal during the days at their home. When your child returns to you, you’ll be able to read about the things they have been up to while away.</p>
<p>What’s inside? Learn about its contents below.</p>
<p><strong>All About Me</strong><br/>Eight fun-filled activity pages capture meaningful details about your child’s life including their favorite things, handprint, and more. Activities that celebrate your child’s two homes are also incorporated.</p>

<p><strong>Progress Chart</strong><br/>Tracking a specific behavior, goal, or habit on a daily basis for your child can be fun, interesting, and helpful. While maintaining a consistent system to do so can be challenging with your child living in two homes, this progress chart is the perfect tool to facilitate it.</p>
<p>Track up to 3 items each month such as how many veggies were eaten, how many books were read, or how many kind acts were performed.</p>

<p><strong>12 Monthly Affirmation Themes and Reflection</strong><br/>Each month focuses on an affirmation, helping to develop a positive mindset. A corresponding monthly journaling activity encourages reflection, participation, and discussion between parents and child.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>For the monthly reflection, decide on how each parent will be involved. Will both parents participate each month? Will one parent take the lead or will you switch off taking the lead each month? Decide on what works best for your situation.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of Home Sweet Homes as a unique solution to help support a child and completely transform their experience when living in two homes after parents separate. I want nothing more than for all children of divorce/separation to feel as loved and supported as possible during this difficult time.</p>
<p>Knowing how challenging finances can be for co-parents, the Pay it Forward program is an initiative to make Home Sweet Homes accessible to children whose parents may not be able to afford a copy.</p>
<p>For the duration of this crowdfunding campaign, for monetary donations of $25 or more, I will send a copy of Home Sweet Homes (shipping will be covered) to someone who needs this. </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Potential risks and challenges that may arise include the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Supply Chain</strong><br/>There are a lot of moving parts to get a product manufactured. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We will be in constant communication with our vendor(s) to get ahead of any problems that may arise.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Quality Issues</strong><br/>We have partnered with a manufacturer with over a decade of experience in printing journals and planners, however, there is always the possibility something could go wrong. We plan on running quality checks onsite during production and again post-production.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fulfillment</strong><br/>Fulfillment of rewards may be delayed because of: 1) Supply chain risks mentioned above or 2) this campaign exceeds our expectations! (With preference for the latter.) While we’d love to personally fulfill the rewards for this campaign, we have a trusted fulfillment center ready to help if the order quantity is beyond our capabilities. Our goal is to fulfill each order in a timely manner and for HSH to arrive to you in excellent condition.</li>

</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Shipping</h2>
<p>I would love nothing more than for children and co-parents across the world to benefit from using Home Sweet Homes. We ship worldwide, however, the reality is that shipping and taxes are expensive for countries outside of the U.S.  </p>
<p>Shipping is not included in the price. For international orders, shipping charges do not include duties, taxes, customs VAT, or any other fees that may be charged by your country. Please check with your local customs office about rules and regulations that may apply to you. These fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped perk nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your perk will be considered fulfilled.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Shipping charges will be added after the campaign ends and each backer will be responsible for paying these costs. If stretch goals are reached, the retail value of the merchandise will increase, and therefore, taxes /customs fees may also be subject to increase.<br/> </p>

<p>Hi! I'm Fiona, a boy mom and former analyst, turned dreamer, turned do-er, turned entrepreneur after finding a lack of resources and tools available to support children after a separation or divorce. I am passionate about mental and physical wellness and sustainable living. I love the outdoors, road trips -- especially those off the beaten path, and am a serial meditator. Originally from Rockville, MD I've lived in Los Angeles, CA for the past decade.</p>
</div>
</div></div>","What is Home Sweet Homes?
Home Sweet Homes is a revolutionary and unique tool designed to elevate the way you co-parent by bridging the gap between transitions and focusing on supporting the person who needs it the most, your child. It thoughtfully combines the benefits of a planner and journal into one physical book, which stays with your child as they go back and forth between their two homes. 
This tool has been created to help you, your co-parent, and your child through the challenges stemming from a separation or divorce which often include:

Supporting your child's mental and emotional wellbeing
Feelings of disconnect amongst parent-child and co-parents 
Lack of continuity between transitions
Limited or inconsistent schedule transparency and accessibility (for child)
Missing out on your child’s day to day life 

Home Sweet Homes prioritizes the needs of your child and encourages him or her to feel supported amidst this life change. Inside, you’ll find monthly and weekly calendar spreads, empowering affirmations, tandem child/parent reflections and writing prompts, weekly challenges, activity pages, free space for creativity, an emergency contacts section, and more.
In its entirety, Home Sweet Homes is a unique reference guide, teaching tool, and touching memory book rolled in one. 
Why I Created Home Sweet Homes
After my son's dad and I separated, I felt stressed, anxious, and worried witnessing my son having to adjust to the constant back and forth between homes. And so, I searched everywhere for any tools, products, or solutions that could help make things easier, but didn't find anything that existed.  I tried co-parenting apps, and although they were helpful for adults, it wasn't a solution that directly involved children.
One day, I was at a dollar store and came across a $2 planner.  I actually debated on whether I should buy it! On the days I had my son, I started writing in a summary of our day then passed it along to my son's dad where he would do the same. When my son came back home with the planner, it was not just nice, but extremely helpful knowing what they had been up to. I started involving my son more in the process, helping him use the calendar to see his schedule and writing in our daily summary together.
It evolved to become a back-and-forth journal and planner which was so useful for all three of us that I wanted to create and design one specifically to help co-parents and their children facing the same problems we experienced. 
Why am I Running a Crowdfunding Campaign?
The purpose of this campaign is to fund an initial print run of Home Sweet Homes. This hardcover book is filled with 274 full-color pages.  Having Home Sweet Homes be entirely in color was extremely important to me as I want children to feel joy and happiness when using this tool, in the midst of their often difficult and stressful circumstances of living in two homes. 
Printing in color is expensive but for a book this length, you can only imagine what those costs might be! In addition to being a single mom, I'm also currently unemployed, I was laid off at the end of 2019 and by March 2020, COVID-19 hit and suddenly nobody was hiring!
Mid-2020, I consciously decided to hold off my job search and spent the second half of the year designing and creating Home Sweet Homes. That said, crowdfunding gives me a way to reduce my financial risk. Plus, it is also a fun and exciting way for me to get the word out about this one-of-a-kind tool!

Benefits 
How to Use
The Home Sweet Homes journal and planner is a tool that stays with your child. It is recommeded for children between ages 4 to 10. The basic premise is that each daily journal entry is to be filled by the parent or caregiver who has primary physical custody or your child if they are able to write.
When it’s time for your child to transition homes, make sure the journal goes with him/her. Your co-parent or child will then fill out the journal during the days at their home. When your child returns to you, you’ll be able to read about the things they have been up to while away.
What’s inside? Learn about its contents below.
All About MeEight fun-filled activity pages capture meaningful details about your child’s life including their favorite things, handprint, and more. Activities that celebrate your child’s two homes are also incorporated.


Progress ChartTracking a specific behavior, goal, or habit on a daily basis for your child can be fun, interesting, and helpful. While maintaining a consistent system to do so can be challenging with your child living in two homes, this progress chart is the perfect tool to facilitate it.
Track up to 3 items each month such as how many veggies were eaten, how many books were read, or how many kind acts were performed.

12 Monthly Affirmation Themes and ReflectionEach month focuses on an affirmation, helping to develop a positive mindset. A corresponding monthly journaling activity encourages reflection, participation, and discussion between parents and child.

 
For the monthly reflection, decide on how each parent will be involved. Will both parents participate each month? Will one parent take the lead or will you switch off taking the lead each month? Decide on what works best for your situation.

Monthly ViewCreate an overview where everyone can easily reference each month’s schedule and events. The undated calendar allows you the flexibility to start at any time and will last for an entire year.
Weekly ViewA snapshot of each day allows you, your co-parent, and most importantly your child to stay in the know and connected. Take a closer look at the weekly view’s features below.
• Open-end journal entry:Parent or child can fill out the daily entry. This can be a summary, achievement, or something funny your child said. It's whatever you want to say, as each of you are the contributing authors!
• Home schedule: Your child can easily reference their schedule at any time with this tool.
• Daily feelings exercise:Track, monitor, and discuss your child's mood
Weekly challenge:A super simple activity reinforces the monthly affirmation. Nothing special is required to complete the activity, just yourselves, Home Sweet Homes, and sometimes a writing tool. Each challenge will fosters participation and discussion with your child!

Free space pagesFive pages per month, (2 lined and 3 blank), can be used in any way desired. Record responses to weekly challenges, make a list, draw or put together a monthly scrapbook. The possibilities are endless! 
Names and NumbersThis section allows for contact information of family, friends, and others to be accessible to your child at anytime. 

Medical History and Emergency ContactsAre you and your co-parent prepared for the unexpected? This important section is purposefully placed at the end of the journal to be easily and quickly accessible.  It includes space for the following information: 

Allergy
Blood type: child and parents
Medication
Emergency numbers: police, fire dept, poison control
Emergency contacts and order in which to call
Medical contacts: pediatrician/dental
Insurance information


 
What Others are Saying
 
Perks

Affirmation Poster:A digital poster in the form of a PDF containing the affirmations in Home Sweet Homes will be sent to all supporters by email. 
Virtual Meet & Greet+ Q&A:A group meetup will be organized once Home Sweet Homes has been shipped. During this virtual meeting, I'll introduce myself, walk you through Home Sweet Homes and answer Q&A.   
Pay it Forward Program
I believe in the power of Home Sweet Homes as a unique solution to help support a child and completely transform their experience when living in two homes after parents separate. I want nothing more than for all children of divorce/separation to feel as loved and supported as possible during this difficult time.
Knowing how challenging finances can be for co-parents, the Pay it Forward program is an initiative to make Home Sweet Homes accessible to children whose parents may not be able to afford a copy.
For the duration of this crowdfunding campaign, for monetary donations of $25 or more, I will send a copy of Home Sweet Homes (shipping will be covered) to someone who needs this. 
If you are someone who could benefit from this program, please fill out the Home Sweet Home Pay it Forward intake form. 
 
Stretch Goals
And... look forward to receiving the following items included in your shipment should this campaign reach the following stretch goals!
 


Risks & Challenges
Potential risks and challenges that may arise include the following:


Supply ChainThere are a lot of moving parts to get a product manufactured. We will be in constant communication with our vendor(s) to get ahead of any problems that may arise.


Quality IssuesWe have partnered with a manufacturer with over a decade of experience in printing journals and planners, however, there is always the possibility something could go wrong. We plan on running quality checks onsite during production and again post-production.

FulfillmentFulfillment of rewards may be delayed because of: 1) Supply chain risks mentioned above or 2) this campaign exceeds our expectations! (With preference for the latter.) While we’d love to personally fulfill the rewards for this campaign, we have a trusted fulfillment center ready to help if the order quantity is beyond our capabilities. Our goal is to fulfill each order in a timely manner and for HSH to arrive to you in excellent condition.

Our Promise in Handling These ChallengesIf anything happens that will affect the projected timeline, we will be transparent and communicate those changes to you immediately. We do ask for your patience and understanding in getting this new product launched. 

Shipping
I would love nothing more than for children and co-parents across the world to benefit from using Home Sweet Homes. We ship worldwide, however, the reality is that shipping and taxes are expensive for countries outside of the U.S.  
Shipping is not included in the price. For international orders, shipping charges do not include duties, taxes, customs VAT, or any other fees that may be charged by your country. Please check with your local customs office about rules and regulations that may apply to you. These fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped perk nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your perk will be considered fulfilled.
Please note: Shipping charges will be added after the campaign ends and each backer will be responsible for paying these costs. If stretch goals are reached, the retail value of the merchandise will increase, and therefore, taxes /customs fees may also be subject to increase. 
How You Can Help
If you aren’t able to financially contribute to this campaign, but you believe this product and my mission to help co-parents and children stay connected, there are still many ways you can help:
Please, spread the word and make some noise about Home Sweet Homes! Every share and mention will help spread awareness about this tool to the many children and co-parents in the world.

Know of a co-parent who could use the HSH journal and planner? Let them know about this campaign!
Directly share this campaign with any…
Child and/or family counselors, therapists or related professionals
Family law professionals (divorce lawyers, mediators, etc.)


Share this campaign with your social circles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>     Hi!  My name is Jane C. Lovelle and I am an aspiring author and writer.  This campaign that I am running isn't really intended for people to donate, but you may do so if you wish.  This is primarily for me to pace my own funds so that I can effectively save up to get self-published.  If you intend on donating, I will have reward perks for those who do so as seen on the campaign page.</p>
<p>     The Drop of a Plug is a story about a small-town business man named Van Carston slipping into a coma after a horrific accident.  His family is left to pick up the pieces of his legacy as well as patch up the family's relationship that had long since been squandered by Van's borderline abusive relationship and impact on the family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To cover baseline publishing costs, I will need $500 dollars to get the ball rolling on this project.  Things such as commission costs for illustrations and editing has already been taken care of.  If you'd like to read a digitized version book for free, then please DM me over on Twitter @janeclovelle</li>
<li>If you donate $10 dollars or more, you will get the book once it is released.  $25 dollars or more will get you a copy that has been signed by yours truly. (So long as you select the appropriate perk)</li>
<li>100% of the funds generated by this campaign will go to publishing costs.  If the goal isn't reached within the 60 day period, then funds will still be raised to cover the publishing costs, the process will just be quite a bit slower.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>I feel that my work would be a great contribution to the rest of the world of literature, and my hopes are that, when you read it, you'll feel the same.  Like I said, you may read my manuscript before you contribute.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Though there is virtually no risk from contributing, I still want to assure the reader that I am a qualified and competent writer who will deliver a product that is nothing short of intriguing and thought-provoking.  Anything you can give would be greatly appreciated in my eyes.</li>
<li>As I've stated previously, if the required funds are met, the book will still be inevitably published, it just may take longer for the process to occur.  I am 100% in on this, and there is very little that could change my mind.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you lack the funds, but are interested, I would greatly appreciate it if you would share my campaign to the furthest reaches of the internet.</li>
<li>Also, don't forget to use Indiegogo's built-in share tools.</li>

100% of the funds generated by this campaign will go to publishing costs.  If the goal isn't reached within the 60 day period, then funds will still be raised to cover the publishing costs, the process will just be quite a bit slower.


The Impact
I feel that my work would be a great contribution to the rest of the world of literature, and my hopes are that, when you read it, you'll feel the same.  Like I said, you may read my manuscript before you contribute.

Risks & Challenges

Though there is virtually no risk from contributing, I still want to assure the reader that I am a qualified and competent writer who will deliver a product that is nothing short of intriguing and thought-provoking.  Anything you can give would be greatly appreciated in my eyes.
As I've stated previously, if the required funds are met, the book will still be inevitably published, it just may take longer for the process to occur.  I am 100% in on this, and there is very little that could change my mind.


Other Ways You Can Help

If you lack the funds, but are interested, I would greatly appreciate it if you would share my campaign to the furthest reaches of the internet.

<p>Football is Everywhere is a highly visual collection of football stories from around the world, showcasing that football is everywhere in a form of a magazine, showcasing how much it impacts people’s lives, in many big and small ways, whether it’s a small town of 20 people managing to keep their club going, whether it’s the Faroe Islands where most of the population plays football, or whether it’s a 4,000 people town reaching the highest tier of football in Sweden. It’s a magazine created with the intention to honor the football communities and their efforts, around the world, that <strong>we intend to launch roughly every 3-4 months, depending on the complexity of the stories. </strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630225452/zp8tian8cylagb3d2ozf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The first issue? It's based on the North of Sweden, the land where the sun almosts never sets in the summer, and where you won't see much light in the winter. We cover the stories of some of the most successful football teams in the North such as Umeå IK, covering their rise and downfall, while at the same time, covering the stories of much smaller teams, that most people probably never heard about, that reached their own successes, whether it was a town of just 2,000 people advancing to the top tier of Swedish football, or whether it's the story of the oldest active coach in Sweden (he's 85) who has been involved in the club he co-founded, for the past 70 years. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630225350/rhlz3ur4pyw9r6hedcr5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The second issue? It covers the rich culture of a tiny island of just 50,000 people which most people don't know the location of, with that being the Faroe Islands. This is a land that went from having sand pitches in the 80s to one of the most football-involved populations there is. </p>
<h3>How did the idea come to be<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629982817/o6ipbquicj55dkfsnqiu.jpg"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>Being involved in football in many different ways, we always saw the impact football had on people. But we haven’t seen the stories of that impact being told, almost anywhere. That’s when we decided to take things into our own hands, and how the idea for Football is Everywhere was born.</p> <p>...With a little twist. </p> <p>See, Football is Everywhere was originally meant to be a set of documentaries. At the time we were living in Italy in Naples so it made the most sense to make the first set about Capri. That was in March 2020. The day before we took the ferry to the island where we were to interview a team playing in Capri, the match got canceled...We still went and started shooting the documentary, shooting a set of interviews, but on the day we returned to Naples, the whole of Italy was in a full lockdown. That put a major hold on that project. And then a year later came the idea of replacing documentaries with a magazine. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630242030/jmnieneuw6up6hvznnmp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’ve done all the hard work. We’ve found the stories. We traveled to them and then told them in the most beautiful way possible, combining great stories with beautiful imagery that we took. We then had our designer Matt do his magic and convert it into possibly the most beautiful football magazine ever done.</p>
<p>...But naturally printing costs. <strong>And the way printers work, you need to print several thousand copies at once so that you can create something that is somewhat affordable. </strong>And that's why we've created this crowdfunding campaign. This €4000 will bring the project that we already made, to paper.  It will kickstart this printing process while at the same time allowing us to work on the next issues of the magazine.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630225521/ubvzsytu5znzf9wnqdpi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</h3>
<p> Pato Jerzak is currently a professional football player and also the person behind the idea of ""Football is Everywhere"". Having grown up in a privileged country (Sweden) where she never was stopped from playing football, knowing that in many countries it's not possible to play, especially for women, she is on a mission to change that. With this magazine, she wanted to show the beauty and importance of football in communities.</p>

<p>We are going to launch posters ranging from A2, to A3+ (bigger than A3) to A4. These are either going to be photos that cover up all the printable area or otherwise, will contain text, whether it's one of our pre-made texts, or whether it's one of your choice (there's a character limit.) All the poster photos shown will be available, but we are also going to add to that list which you will see in the coming days in the ""Updates"" section.</p>
<p>When the time is right, we will send you out a survey in which you can fill out the poster of your choice and the finish you would like, whether it's the metallic or matte finish. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630225597/wuug9xmysyxurohf2fry.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Some of the perks include framed posters.

</div></div>","About Football is Everywhere
Football is Everywhere is a highly visual collection of football stories from around the world, showcasing that football is everywhere in a form of a magazine, showcasing how much it impacts people’s lives, in many big and small ways, whether it’s a small town of 20 people managing to keep their club going, whether it’s the Faroe Islands where most of the population plays football, or whether it’s a 4,000 people town reaching the highest tier of football in Sweden. It’s a magazine created with the intention to honor the football communities and their efforts, around the world, that we intend to launch roughly every 3-4 months, depending on the complexity of the stories. 
The first issue? It's based on the North of Sweden, the land where the sun almosts never sets in the summer, and where you won't see much light in the winter. We cover the stories of some of the most successful football teams in the North such as Umeå IK, covering their rise and downfall, while at the same time, covering the stories of much smaller teams, that most people probably never heard about, that reached their own successes, whether it was a town of just 2,000 people advancing to the top tier of Swedish football, or whether it's the story of the oldest active coach in Sweden (he's 85) who has been involved in the club he co-founded, for the past 70 years. 
The second issue? It covers the rich culture of a tiny island of just 50,000 people which most people don't know the location of, with that being the Faroe Islands. This is a land that went from having sand pitches in the 80s to one of the most football-involved populations there is. 
How did the idea come to be

Being involved in football in many different ways, we always saw the impact football had on people. But we haven’t seen the stories of that impact being told, almost anywhere. That’s when we decided to take things into our own hands, and how the idea for Football is Everywhere was born. ...With a little twist.  See, Football is Everywhere was originally meant to be a set of documentaries. At the time we were living in Italy in Naples so it made the most sense to make the first set about Capri. That was in March 2020. The day before we took the ferry to the island where we were to interview a team playing in Capri, the match got canceled...We still went and started shooting the documentary, shooting a set of interviews, but on the day we returned to Naples, the whole of Italy was in a full lockdown. That put a major hold on that project. And then a year later came the idea of replacing documentaries with a magazine. 

What We Need & What You Get
We’ve done all the hard work. We’ve found the stories. We traveled to them and then told them in the most beautiful way possible, combining great stories with beautiful imagery that we took. We then had our designer Matt do his magic and convert it into possibly the most beautiful football magazine ever done.
...But naturally printing costs. And the way printers work, you need to print several thousand copies at once so that you can create something that is somewhat affordable. And that's why we've created this crowdfunding campaign. This €4000 will bring the project that we already made, to paper.  It will kickstart this printing process while at the same time allowing us to work on the next issues of the magazine.
About the Creators of the first issue:
PATO JERZAK

 Pato Jerzak is currently a professional football player and also the person behind the idea of ""Football is Everywhere"". Having grown up in a privileged country (Sweden) where she never was stopped from playing football, knowing that in many countries it's not possible to play, especially for women, she is on a mission to change that. With this magazine, she wanted to show the beauty and importance of football in communities.
MICHAEL SMOLSKI


Michael Smolski is a sports documentary filmmaker coming from Ireland with a passion for telling stories worth telling especially in the world of football.  He's also a sports photographer and journalist but prefers to spend his time filming. He's currently working on two major football documentaries.
MATT BERRY


Matt Berry is a British graphic designer based in Buckinghamshire, UK that has been practicing graphic design for over 20 years. He currently runs his own design practice called Made by Berry. In 2012 he turned a passion-project into a football brand called Dinkit. Dinkit fuses the beautiful game with graphic design and typography to create football art & design.

<p><strong>MALIVOR: CATACLYSM'S EDGE</strong></p>
<p>Malivor: Cataclysm's Edge (MCE) is the highly-anticipated, third title in the Savage Realms Gamebooks library and is written in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy gamebooks. YOU determine the outcome of the story by the choices that you make! Sometimes, your very fate will even depend on the roll of the dice themselves!</p>
<p>The two small shorts that you got in issues 1 and 2 of the Gamebook Zine were only a taste of what will truly be an epic storyline and gamebook!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>Tasked with finding a lost family heirloom, you unwittingly stumble upon an ancient evil whose malevolent plot could very well bring about the complete and utter destruction of your world...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AN EXCERPT FROM MALIVOR: CATACLYSM'S EDGE</strong></p>
<p>Rounding a bend, you abruptly emerge from the passage onto a large shelf of rock in what seems to be a cavern of considerable size. To your right, a stone staircase spirals downwards until it is lost from view. An almost identical flight of stairs hugs the cavern wall to your left as it ascends upwards to what looks like the opening of yet another tunnel. The chanting seems to be coming from somewhere directly beneath you. Crouching low and making your way to the edge of the rocky outcropping, you are shocked by what you see transpiring below!</p>
<p>Standing in a close-knit circle around an enormous, open sarcophagus made of stone are nine figures in dark, hooded robes. With their hands raised, they recite the words to what is obviously an incantation over the desiccated remains of a large humanoid lying inside of the sarcophagus. Even as you are watching, another mysterious figure appears. He is hooded as well, but wears a strange mask, and at his approach, the others disrobe, but continue chanting while standing there naked. It is not long before the rattling cacophony of their chant reaches fever pitch, and then, quite suddenly, there is an abrupt and very unnerving silence as they allow the man with the mask to pass through them. Approaching the sarcophagus and holding his hands above the body, the man utters several words in an unfamiliar dialect, simultaneously producing a dagger from within his robe. Almost immediately after, one of the women, in a trance-like state, breaks from the circle. Slowly making her way over to the sarcophagus, the woman leans over it, and as she does so, the man with the mask slits her throat, dousing the withered remains within with her blood. One by one, each of the others follow suit, offering themselves as well in what is literally a sacrificial bloodbath.</p>
<p>“Lord Malivor, the Malevolent,” cries the man with the mask as he carves glyphs in the air with his hands, “long have we, your faithful followers, waited for the advent of your second coming, and now, we beseech thee rise ― rise and be reborn, fulfilling the ancient prophecy that says you will destroy the kingdoms of Ataraxia and usher in your own glorious kingdom of eternal darkness! May it be as foretold!”</p>
<p>What happens next is unexpectedly more horrifying than anything you could have imagined, for the blood-drenched flesh of the desiccated corpse rapidly begins to regenerate, miraculously transforming into healthy, living tissue!</p>
<p>“You have done well, my disciple,” says Malivor, as he sits up and steps out of the sarcophagus.</p>
<p>Completely naked, the formidable being you now see emerging from the sarcophagus is anything but human, easily standing one-and-a-half times taller than the average man. Two small horns protrude from the front of his hairless head, while serrated teeth and hands and feet culminating in deadly talons only further add to his frightening appearance.</p>
<p>The man with the mask immediately falls to his knees with his face to the ground.</p>
<p>“You may rise, Agamon,” Malivor says.</p>
<p>“What is thy bidding, my lord and master?” Agamon asks, as he slowly gets to his feet and removes his mask.</p>
<p>“The Draconomicon and the Sigil Stone of Sargonis… have you been able to locate their where ―” Malivor begins before being cut off, for it is at that very moment that something unanticipated and most inconvenient happens ― you accidentally sneeze, and quite loudly for that matter! Both Malivor and Agamon look up towards you in surprise, and in another instant, before you even have time to react, Malivor is standing over you.</p>
<p>“It would seem, Agamon, that we have ourselves an interloper!” Malivor says, his mouth twisting into a smile of cruel amusement as he reaches down, grabs you swiftly by the neck and lifts you effortlessly into the air so that you are both at eye level to one another. Feet dangling, you quickly draw your sword, but Malivor easily wrenches it from your grasp with his free hand like a toy being taken from a small child.</p>
<p>“Your insolent and intrusive act merits nothing less than death, and die you shall, foolish mortal, but your end will not be today! No... instead, I will allow you to see that which is soon to come ― the fall and utter destruction of your beloved Ataraxia!” declares Malivor, the carrion stench of his breath convulsing your stomach as he speaks.</p>
<p>Instantly, your mind’s eye is raptured to a place of absolute and unimaginable devastation ― a barren and broken wasteland of charcoal and ash, where the air is literally saturated with the fetid smell of burning flesh and rotting corpses. Waveless and unmoving, the oceans have become little more than stagnant ponds filled with death and decay, and a thick haze of smoke practically obscures a blood-red Ataraxian sun.</p>
<p>And then, the vision rapidly fades and you suddenly awaken as if from a deep slumber to find yourself in the cavern again and lying face-down on the outcropping of rock. Both Malivor and Agamon are gone.</p>
<p>Picking yourself up, you recover your longsword, and determine that your chances of finding a way back to the surface are much greater with the staircase leading upwards. Following the tunnel at the top, you eventually emerge from the entrance of a well-hidden cave just outside of Autumn Glade. The sun has just begun to rise as you immediately make your way back to the chapel ruins with the hope of retrieving your mount, and it is with great relief that you find your horse, Beatrix, grazing not far from the entrance to the undercroft where you left her.</p>
<p>Somehow, Malivor must be stopped, and his plan to overthrow all of the kingdoms of Ataraxia thwarted, but how? Still very much overwhelmed and reeling inside from the terrifying vision of apocalyptic ruin, you mount your horse, and carefully consider the limited options before you.</p>
<p>A full day’s ride northwest from your position is the sea port and Capital City of Evan-Yor. Perhaps there is something the Coalition of Kings can do to stop Malivor if you raise the alarm. Unfortunately, to get there, you will have no choice but to ride through some extremely hazardous terrain, including the notoriously treacherous Murkmire Swamp.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were to head due south, lying nearly the same distance away is the University of Divination and the Arcane Arts. Maybe the mages there could shed some light on the Malivorian Prophecy of which Agamon spoke. Too, they might know more about the mysterious Sigil Stone of Sargonis as well as the Draconomicon. With that being said, getting there will be just as dangerous, if not more so, with your trek taking you through the harsh and desolate Badlands of Bukhari.</p>
<p>If you decide to make for the sea port of Evan-Yor with the hope of speaking to the Coalition of Kings, <strong>turn to 105</strong></p>
<p>Or, will you choose to ride south for the University of Divination and the Arcane Arts? If this is your choice, <strong>turn to 179</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER EXCERPT FROM MALIVOR</strong></p>
<p>Sometime later, the path you have been following unexpectedly opens up into a broad clearing. Right away, your mount begins to roll her eyes, visibly shaken and trembling in fright as she tries to retreat backward. And then, you simultaneously smell and see it ― the heavy stink of carrion and rotting flesh and what appears to be the opening to a large, crater-like pit just ahead! Its outer rim is literally strewn with the carcasses and skeletal remains of both men and beasts, and like the moat around a castle, it is surrounded on all sides by a stagnant pool of putrid, green slime. </p>
<p>Suddenly, a large serpentine head perched on a long, scaly neck rises from its depths. This is quickly followed by a second, and then a third, fourth, and finally, a fifth head, as a terrifying, reptilian monstrosity crawls out of the pit.</p>
<p>Even as the hydra begins advancing towards you, you and your halfling companion have already dismounted ― you readying your double-edged blade and Tolman drawing his own after quickly lighting a torch...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FEATURING THE INCREDIBLE ARTWORK OF PER GRADIN</strong></p>
<p>An epic story is only made better with the addition of epic art. That's why Savage Realms Gamebooks is excited to announce that fantasy artist, Per Gradin, will be bringing his dynamic style and phenomenal talents as an RPG illustrator to this book.</p>
<p>Here's the first illustration for Malivor: Cataclysm's Edge:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632460825/cixrdoalple4xlu5pxi0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Below are some more samples of his mind-blowing work!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And featuring fillustrations by artist, Pat O'Neill...</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE GAME MECHANICS</strong></p>
<p><strong>RULES OF PLAY</strong></p>
<p>The book you are holding in your hands is unique. Not extraordinary by any means, but unique in the fact that it is also a role-playing game. It is also unique in the sense that YOU choose your own destiny; that by your own choices YOU determine the direction and outcome of this story! In fact, sometimes your very fate might even depend on the roll of the dice themselves!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL NEED</strong></p>
<p>In addition to this gamebook and the CHARACTER LOG sheet contained within, you will also need a pencil with an eraser, and two six-sided dice (one for yourself and one for your opponent(s). The only other thing you will need for gameplay is a blank sheet of paper so that you can track damage to your LIFE FORCE and tally the damage you inflict upon your opponents.</p>
<p><strong>CREATING YOUR CHARACTER</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632639324/orbai8huspel79y2ca2n.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Included with this interactive adventure is a CHARACTER LOG sheet. It is highly recommended you make photocopies of it for gameplay. (Malivor: Cataclysm's Edge CHARACTER LOG sheets are also available for downloading and printing on our Facebook page, under the files tab at Savage Realms Gamebooks).</p>
<p>YOUR NAME</p>
<p>In the space provided, write your character’s NAME.</p>
<p>YOUR LIFE FORCE (LR SCORE)</p>
<p>Not simply just a measure of your health, it is also a measure of your overall fortitude, stamina, and resilience. Your default LR score is always 25, and any damage you sustain, whether it be from opponents, traps, or whatever, is subtracted from this number. (Use a separate sheet of paper to track any damage you might take during the course of your adventure).</p>
<p>CHARACTER CLASS</p>
<p>In this gamebook, you play the role of a FIGHTER ADEPT.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR COMBAT SKILL SCORE (CSS)</strong></p>
<p>This encompasses both your attack and defensive abilities when in combat. To determine your Combat Skill Score, or CSS, roll 1d6 and record that number in the space provided. If your roll is a 3 or LESS, then your default CSS is automatically a <strong>3</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SKILL AND ATTRIBUTE SCORES</strong></p>
<p>In addition to your Combat Skill Score, you also have three other skills as well as six attributes.</p>
<p>Your skills:</p>
<p>STEALTH</p>
<p>(This affects your ability to sneak, hide, silently take out opponents or even blend into a crowd).</p>
<p>LOCK PICKING</p>
<p>(This affects your ability to unlock and open doors, chests, and locks).</p>
<p>PICKPOCKETING</p>
<p>(This affects your ability to remove items from someone’s person or even plant something on them without being detected).</p>
<p>Your attributes:</p>
<p>INTELLECT</p>
<p>(This attribute comes into play with regard to solving problems and puzzles).</p>
<p>STRENGTH</p>
<p>(This attribute comes into play when you need to complete certain physical tasks).</p>
<p>AGILITY</p>
<p>(This attribute is a measure of your ability and  speed when running or fleeing, but could also come into play when dodging attacks).</p>
<p>CHARISMA</p>
<p>(This affects your ability to bribe, persuade, intimidate, barter and even lie).</p>
<p>RESISTANCE</p>
<p>(This affects your ability to resist certain lesser spells, as well as poisons, venom and toxins).</p>
<p>LUCK</p>
<p>(Although it is neither a skill nor an attribute, you can never have too much luck on your side).</p>
<p>Using your allotted budget of <strong>18 points</strong>, distribute those points between your skills and attributes now. Each skill and attribute must have a minimum of <strong>1 point</strong> assigned to them, but cannot, at any time in the game, ever have more than <strong>5</strong>. (Write these numbers next to their corresponding skill or attribute on your CHARACTER LOG sheet).</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE that as the game progresses, you will have opportunities to increase the scores of both your skills and your attributes, but those scores can never exceed <strong>5</strong>, which is the maximum you can have for each one.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR PURSE AND YOUR INVENTORY</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the game, you will find various items that can be used during the course of your adventure. Gold pieces and gold coins are added to your PURSE. Everything else that you find is recorded in your INVENTORY. Any items that you consume, sell or are stolen must be removed from your INVENTORY.</p>
<p>You begin your quest with EIGHT items ― a double-edged longsword, chainmail armor, a bedroll with a blanket, provisions (food), TWO HEALTH potions and a wound dressing kit. Add these items to your INVENTORY now.</p>
<p><strong>ENCOUNTERS</strong></p>
<p>This is where you can keep track of all the various monsters and enemies you have faced and defeated throughout your adventure.</p>
<p><strong>COMBAT</strong></p>
<p>The combat in this gamebook is a simple, two-dice (2d6) attack/defend system. Each combat round begins with you rolling 1d6 and then adding it to your Combat Skill Score. The other 1d6 is rolled for your opponent and then added to their Combat Skill Score (represented in the text as Combat). Whoever has the highest total between you and your opponent is the party that “hits.” A 1d6 is then rolled to see how much damage was inflicted. A tie, where both of your totals are the same, means that neither of you hit.</p>
<p>This continues until you or the opposing side has been eliminated!</p>
<p>MULTIPLE OPPONENTS</p>
<p>Although in real-life combat scenarios multiple opponents would most likely attack simultaneously, in this adventure, they are fought one at a time.</p>
<p>HEALTH POTIONS</p>
<p>HEALTH potions can be used at any time to restore lost LR points, except when you are in combat. Each HEALTH potion can be used ONE TIME to restore 5 points. You are also free to use as many of them as you wish at any time, but your LIFE FORCE can never ever exceed its original default of 25.</p>
<p>DYING</p>
<p>If you are killed in combat, or die because of a failed check or choice you made, your adventure is over and you must return to the beginning of this book and start your quest all over.</p>
<p><strong>USING YOUR SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the course of this story, you will be introduced to unique scenarios that may call upon you to use a specific attribute. Whenever this happens, you will be prompted to do an attribute check by rolling a 1d6. If your roll is AT or UNDER your CURRENT SCORE for the attribute that is being checked, you have successfully passed that check. If, however, your roll exceeds your current score, then your check has failed.</p>
<p>SKILL AND ATTRIBUTE INCREASES</p>
<p>In real life, we learn from our failures and mistakes. For this reason, skill and attribute increases in this book are awarded for FAILURES rather than successes. This not only simulates learning, but prevents power creep and the “success-breeds-success” dynamic. Of course, if that failed check results in your untimely demise, then obviously, you will NOT be awarded an increase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that you have a firm grasp of the gameplay mechanics...</p>
<p>Welcome to the World of Ataraxia!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BOOK SPECIFICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Both the paperback and hardback editions of the book will be approximately 6"" x 9"" and will be between 250 and 300 pages in total length, depending on the final number of illustrations.  Should you decide not to partner with us in this campaign, paperback copies will be available after the pledges have been fulfilled on Amazon.</p>

MALIVOR: CATACLYSM'S EDGE
Malivor: Cataclysm's Edge (MCE) is the highly-anticipated, third title in the Savage Realms Gamebooks library and is written in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure and Fighting Fantasy gamebooks. YOU determine the outcome of the story by the choices that you make! Sometimes, your very fate will even depend on the roll of the dice themselves!
The two small shorts that you got in issues 1 and 2 of the Gamebook Zine were only a taste of what will truly be an epic storyline and gamebook!
 
SYNOPSIS
Tasked with finding a lost family heirloom, you unwittingly stumble upon an ancient evil whose malevolent plot could very well bring about the complete and utter destruction of your world...
 
AN EXCERPT FROM MALIVOR: CATACLYSM'S EDGE
Rounding a bend, you abruptly emerge from the passage onto a large shelf of rock in what seems to be a cavern of considerable size. To your right, a stone staircase spirals downwards until it is lost from view. An almost identical flight of stairs hugs the cavern wall to your left as it ascends upwards to what looks like the opening of yet another tunnel. The chanting seems to be coming from somewhere directly beneath you. Crouching low and making your way to the edge of the rocky outcropping, you are shocked by what you see transpiring below!
Standing in a close-knit circle around an enormous, open sarcophagus made of stone are nine figures in dark, hooded robes. With their hands raised, they recite the words to what is obviously an incantation over the desiccated remains of a large humanoid lying inside of the sarcophagus. Even as you are watching, another mysterious figure appears. He is hooded as well, but wears a strange mask, and at his approach, the others disrobe, but continue chanting while standing there naked. It is not long before the rattling cacophony of their chant reaches fever pitch, and then, quite suddenly, there is an abrupt and very unnerving silence as they allow the man with the mask to pass through them. Approaching the sarcophagus and holding his hands above the body, the man utters several words in an unfamiliar dialect, simultaneously producing a dagger from within his robe. Almost immediately after, one of the women, in a trance-like state, breaks from the circle. Slowly making her way over to the sarcophagus, the woman leans over it, and as she does so, the man with the mask slits her throat, dousing the withered remains within with her blood. One by one, each of the others follow suit, offering themselves as well in what is literally a sacrificial bloodbath.
“Lord Malivor, the Malevolent,” cries the man with the mask as he carves glyphs in the air with his hands, “long have we, your faithful followers, waited for the advent of your second coming, and now, we beseech thee rise ― rise and be reborn, fulfilling the ancient prophecy that says you will destroy the kingdoms of Ataraxia and usher in your own glorious kingdom of eternal darkness! May it be as foretold!”
What happens next is unexpectedly more horrifying than anything you could have imagined, for the blood-drenched flesh of the desiccated corpse rapidly begins to regenerate, miraculously transforming into healthy, living tissue!
“You have done well, my disciple,” says Malivor, as he sits up and steps out of the sarcophagus.
Completely naked, the formidable being you now see emerging from the sarcophagus is anything but human, easily standing one-and-a-half times taller than the average man. Two small horns protrude from the front of his hairless head, while serrated teeth and hands and feet culminating in deadly talons only further add to his frightening appearance.
The man with the mask immediately falls to his knees with his face to the ground.
“You may rise, Agamon,” Malivor says.
“What is thy bidding, my lord and master?” Agamon asks, as he slowly gets to his feet and removes his mask.
“The Draconomicon and the Sigil Stone of Sargonis… have you been able to locate their where ―” Malivor begins before being cut off, for it is at that very moment that something unanticipated and most inconvenient happens ― you accidentally sneeze, and quite loudly for that matter! Both Malivor and Agamon look up towards you in surprise, and in another instant, before you even have time to react, Malivor is standing over you.
“It would seem, Agamon, that we have ourselves an interloper!” Malivor says, his mouth twisting into a smile of cruel amusement as he reaches down, grabs you swiftly by the neck and lifts you effortlessly into the air so that you are both at eye level to one another. Feet dangling, you quickly draw your sword, but Malivor easily wrenches it from your grasp with his free hand like a toy being taken from a small child.
“Your insolent and intrusive act merits nothing less than death, and die you shall, foolish mortal, but your end will not be today! No... instead, I will allow you to see that which is soon to come ― the fall and utter destruction of your beloved Ataraxia!” declares Malivor, the carrion stench of his breath convulsing your stomach as he speaks.
Instantly, your mind’s eye is raptured to a place of absolute and unimaginable devastation ― a barren and broken wasteland of charcoal and ash, where the air is literally saturated with the fetid smell of burning flesh and rotting corpses. Waveless and unmoving, the oceans have become little more than stagnant ponds filled with death and decay, and a thick haze of smoke practically obscures a blood-red Ataraxian sun.
And then, the vision rapidly fades and you suddenly awaken as if from a deep slumber to find yourself in the cavern again and lying face-down on the outcropping of rock. Both Malivor and Agamon are gone.
Picking yourself up, you recover your longsword, and determine that your chances of finding a way back to the surface are much greater with the staircase leading upwards. Following the tunnel at the top, you eventually emerge from the entrance of a well-hidden cave just outside of Autumn Glade. The sun has just begun to rise as you immediately make your way back to the chapel ruins with the hope of retrieving your mount, and it is with great relief that you find your horse, Beatrix, grazing not far from the entrance to the undercroft where you left her.
Somehow, Malivor must be stopped, and his plan to overthrow all of the kingdoms of Ataraxia thwarted, but how? Still very much overwhelmed and reeling inside from the terrifying vision of apocalyptic ruin, you mount your horse, and carefully consider the limited options before you.
A full day’s ride northwest from your position is the sea port and Capital City of Evan-Yor. Perhaps there is something the Coalition of Kings can do to stop Malivor if you raise the alarm. Unfortunately, to get there, you will have no choice but to ride through some extremely hazardous terrain, including the notoriously treacherous Murkmire Swamp.
On the other hand, if you were to head due south, lying nearly the same distance away is the University of Divination and the Arcane Arts. Maybe the mages there could shed some light on the Malivorian Prophecy of which Agamon spoke. Too, they might know more about the mysterious Sigil Stone of Sargonis as well as the Draconomicon. With that being said, getting there will be just as dangerous, if not more so, with your trek taking you through the harsh and desolate Badlands of Bukhari.
If you decide to make for the sea port of Evan-Yor with the hope of speaking to the Coalition of Kings, turn to 105
Or, will you choose to ride south for the University of Divination and the Arcane Arts? If this is your choice, turn to 179
 
ANOTHER EXCERPT FROM MALIVOR
Sometime later, the path you have been following unexpectedly opens up into a broad clearing. Right away, your mount begins to roll her eyes, visibly shaken and trembling in fright as she tries to retreat backward. And then, you simultaneously smell and see it ― the heavy stink of carrion and rotting flesh and what appears to be the opening to a large, crater-like pit just ahead! Its outer rim is literally strewn with the carcasses and skeletal remains of both men and beasts, and like the moat around a castle, it is surrounded on all sides by a stagnant pool of putrid, green slime. 
Suddenly, a large serpentine head perched on a long, scaly neck rises from its depths. This is quickly followed by a second, and then a third, fourth, and finally, a fifth head, as a terrifying, reptilian monstrosity crawls out of the pit.
Even as the hydra begins advancing towards you, you and your halfling companion have already dismounted ― you readying your double-edged blade and Tolman drawing his own after quickly lighting a torch...
 
FEATURING THE INCREDIBLE ARTWORK OF PER GRADIN
An epic story is only made better with the addition of epic art. That's why Savage Realms Gamebooks is excited to announce that fantasy artist, Per Gradin, will be bringing his dynamic style and phenomenal talents as an RPG illustrator to this book.
Here's the first illustration for Malivor: Cataclysm's Edge:

Below are some more samples of his mind-blowing work!
 
And featuring fillustrations by artist, Pat O'Neill...
 
THE GAME MECHANICS
RULES OF PLAY
The book you are holding in your hands is unique. Not extraordinary by any means, but unique in the fact that it is also a role-playing game. It is also unique in the sense that YOU choose your own destiny; that by your own choices YOU determine the direction and outcome of this story! In fact, sometimes your very fate might even depend on the roll of the dice themselves!
WHAT YOU WILL NEED
In addition to this gamebook and the CHARACTER LOG sheet contained within, you will also need a pencil with an eraser, and two six-sided dice (one for yourself and one for your opponent(s). The only other thing you will need for gameplay is a blank sheet of paper so that you can track damage to your LIFE FORCE and tally the damage you inflict upon your opponents.
CREATING YOUR CHARACTER

Included with this interactive adventure is a CHARACTER LOG sheet. It is highly recommended you make photocopies of it for gameplay. (Malivor: Cataclysm's Edge CHARACTER LOG sheets are also available for downloading and printing on our Facebook page, under the files tab at Savage Realms Gamebooks).
YOUR NAME
In the space provided, write your character’s NAME.
YOUR LIFE FORCE (LR SCORE)
Not simply just a measure of your health, it is also a measure of your overall fortitude, stamina, and resilience. Your default LR score is always 25, and any damage you sustain, whether it be from opponents, traps, or whatever, is subtracted from this number. (Use a separate sheet of paper to track any damage you might take during the course of your adventure).
CHARACTER CLASS
In this gamebook, you play the role of a FIGHTER ADEPT.
YOUR COMBAT SKILL SCORE (CSS)
This encompasses both your attack and defensive abilities when in combat. To determine your Combat Skill Score, or CSS, roll 1d6 and record that number in the space provided. If your roll is a 3 or LESS, then your default CSS is automatically a 3.
SKILL AND ATTRIBUTE SCORES
In addition to your Combat Skill Score, you also have three other skills as well as six attributes.
Your skills:
STEALTH
(This affects your ability to sneak, hide, silently take out opponents or even blend into a crowd).
LOCK PICKING
(This affects your ability to unlock and open doors, chests, and locks).
PICKPOCKETING
(This affects your ability to remove items from someone’s person or even plant something on them without being detected).
Your attributes:
INTELLECT
(This attribute comes into play with regard to solving problems and puzzles).
STRENGTH
(This attribute comes into play when you need to complete certain physical tasks).
AGILITY
(This attribute is a measure of your ability and  speed when running or fleeing, but could also come into play when dodging attacks).
CHARISMA
(This affects your ability to bribe, persuade, intimidate, barter and even lie).
RESISTANCE
(This affects your ability to resist certain lesser spells, as well as poisons, venom and toxins).
LUCK
(Although it is neither a skill nor an attribute, you can never have too much luck on your side).
Using your allotted budget of 18 points, distribute those points between your skills and attributes now. Each skill and attribute must have a minimum of 1 point assigned to them, but cannot, at any time in the game, ever have more than 5. (Write these numbers next to their corresponding skill or attribute on your CHARACTER LOG sheet).
PLEASE NOTE that as the game progresses, you will have opportunities to increase the scores of both your skills and your attributes, but those scores can never exceed 5, which is the maximum you can have for each one.
YOUR PURSE AND YOUR INVENTORY
Throughout the game, you will find various items that can be used during the course of your adventure. Gold pieces and gold coins are added to your PURSE. Everything else that you find is recorded in your INVENTORY. Any items that you consume, sell or are stolen must be removed from your INVENTORY.
You begin your quest with EIGHT items ― a double-edged longsword, chainmail armor, a bedroll with a blanket, provisions (food), TWO HEALTH potions and a wound dressing kit. Add these items to your INVENTORY now.
ENCOUNTERS
This is where you can keep track of all the various monsters and enemies you have faced and defeated throughout your adventure.
COMBAT
The combat in this gamebook is a simple, two-dice (2d6) attack/defend system. Each combat round begins with you rolling 1d6 and then adding it to your Combat Skill Score. The other 1d6 is rolled for your opponent and then added to their Combat Skill Score (represented in the text as Combat). Whoever has the highest total between you and your opponent is the party that “hits.” A 1d6 is then rolled to see how much damage was inflicted. A tie, where both of your totals are the same, means that neither of you hit.
This continues until you or the opposing side has been eliminated!
MULTIPLE OPPONENTS
Although in real-life combat scenarios multiple opponents would most likely attack simultaneously, in this adventure, they are fought one at a time.
HEALTH POTIONS
HEALTH potions can be used at any time to restore lost LR points, except when you are in combat. Each HEALTH potion can be used ONE TIME to restore 5 points. You are also free to use as many of them as you wish at any time, but your LIFE FORCE can never ever exceed its original default of 25.
DYING
If you are killed in combat, or die because of a failed check or choice you made, your adventure is over and you must return to the beginning of this book and start your quest all over.
USING YOUR SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES
Throughout the course of this story, you will be introduced to unique scenarios that may call upon you to use a specific attribute. Whenever this happens, you will be prompted to do an attribute check by rolling a 1d6. If your roll is AT or UNDER your CURRENT SCORE for the attribute that is being checked, you have successfully passed that check. If, however, your roll exceeds your current score, then your check has failed.
SKILL AND ATTRIBUTE INCREASES
In real life, we learn from our failures and mistakes. For this reason, skill and attribute increases in this book are awarded for FAILURES rather than successes. This not only simulates learning, but prevents power creep and the “success-breeds-success” dynamic. Of course, if that failed check results in your untimely demise, then obviously, you will NOT be awarded an increase.
 
Now that you have a firm grasp of the gameplay mechanics...
Welcome to the World of Ataraxia!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ryden Allen. I'm an autistic, nonbinary parent (oh, and I work in a library, but really, parenting is my number one job!) When I started the process of becoming pregnant, I looked for anything I could relate to. There's, well, not a lot out there. Since then, I've written two picture books and a young adult novel about my experiences, one of which you'll be able to support here!</p>
<p>I wrote My Daddy's Not Like Other Daddies because I wanted to give my kid and all the others I see in his shoes something to relate to. I bring him home picture books every week, and none of them reflect our family. I'd say it's about time to change that.</p>
<p>The book has already been accepted for publication at a local publisher, but we need help covering the cost to print it. Otherwise, we've got a book...that no one can read. Which is basically no book at all. Your contribution will literally change the world of children's picture books by helping to produce something that is needed and barely exists, if at all. You'll also help me, a trans person myself, to write more books to reach even more audiences and keep on increasing diversity in media!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $600. This will allow us to print 100 books, enough to get us started without creating a burden on myself or on buyers. It will go directly to printing the book that you are paying for and sending it to you. The book is completed, so if we don't reach our goal, it will still be printed, but it will take longer to get it out, there may be less printed, and it will increase my own debt burden since I'll have to pay out of pocket.</p>
<p>Either way, if you contribute, you will get to support an Own Voices project and increase diversity in kids' lit! Plus you'll have the chance to get first copies of my book, copies of my new adult book Expectations, and MASSIVE THANKS. Can you feel the thanks coming your way already?!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book is important to me because not only will it create representation for my child and their family, but it will help me keep writing (financially and moralistically) and just keep us keeping on.</p>
<p>But it's bigger than that. Have you ever browsed books and been disappointed not to find anyone you can relate to? Maybe you're a tomboy and all the girls in media are fancy princesses. Maybe you're a different race than all the protagonists you enjoy. My book will increase diversity in an area barely touched and give kids and their parents a chance to see themselves in a book and know their voices are worth hearing.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This book has been accepted for publication. It has completed art and text that is ready to go except for finishing touches. It's happening, whether we meet our goal or not.</p>
<p>That said, if we don't meet the goal, it will be a slower publication process. Not only will it increase hardship on me (not to be self-centered, but, uh, I need to not be in any more debt and instead put my money towards my kid), but it will also take more time as we will have to print smaller batches. This will also drive up the cost to buyers, a population that is more likely to face economic hardships themselves.</p>
<p>But it will happen. I will use credit cards and (hopefully mild) price increases to pay for printing, as well as open it to pre-orders. I will be upfront in challenges and letting anyone pre-ordering know my timeline.</p>
<p>Another challenge is getting books in the mail. I live by a post office, but I'm a single parent (for other single parents, enough said--for non-single parents, it's just harder to get places while hauling a small child). I plan on making weekly trips and enlisting help of family if ordering gets high enough to be necessary. I've sold items online and always made my deadline, I'm really good at time management, and one of the perks is to get to the front of the line.  Unless something extreme happens (*looks at 2020* *knocks on wood with both hands*), if you contribute, you will be getting your perk, no matter what.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's fine. Look, we've all had a crazy year (and a half...). I'm right there with you. What you can do is share it among your friends and family. Hit the share button. Talk about it at the (new, socially distanced) water cooler and in the grocery line. Got queer friends? Let them know a book is coming that's just for them! Even if they can't contributed, they can be excited for it! Mention it to your librarian--while they might not be able to contribute to Indiegogo, it will get the book on their radar and when it does come out, one way or another, they'll be able to add it to their collection. Even if you can contribute, please do this anyway! Get excited about it, because that makes things happen!</p>

I've sold items online and always made my deadline, I'm really good at time management, and one of the perks is to get to the front of the line.  Unless something extreme happens (*looks at 2020* *knocks on wood with both hands*), if you contribute, you will be getting your perk, no matter what.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, that's fine. Look, we've all had a crazy year (and a half...). I'm right there with you. What you can do is share it among your friends and family. Hit the share button. Talk about it at the (new, socially distanced) water cooler and in the grocery line. Got queer friends? Let them know a book is coming that's just for them! Even if they can't contributed, they can be excited for it! Mention it to your librarian--while they might not be able to contribute to Indiegogo, it will get the book on their radar and when it does come out, one way or another, they'll be able to add it to their collection. Even if you can contribute, please do this anyway! Get excited about it, because that makes things happen!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Let us first state the obvious: This book is not meant to objectify women. On the contrary: this book is made in honor and praise of women—all women—and boobs are the red thread that leads us on this particular journey. </p>
<p>This book is also not about the size or appearance of any boob, or even about having them or not. Big boobs, small boobs, no boobs—it doesn’t matter. We favor no one and include everyone.</p>
<p>Instead, this book is about what boobs symbolize. As an icon, these fascinating, visually striking, biological wonders of cultural importance transcend language, yet throughout history they have often been misunderstood and mishandled. Boobs are the basic symbols of life, freedom, prosperity, joy, safety, sex, independence—not to mention food—and they tirelessly bear the promise of a brighter future. After you finish reading this book, you may ask yourself, why, is there anything a boob can’t do?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608156767/vrvu8vidsyr1q4zncfpj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And last but not least, this book is about how to care for your boobs. Our number one goal is to inspire boob health, including screening and self-examination, because when it comes to breast cancer, the battle of the boob is one we will win. That’s why all profits from the future sale of this book will go directly to organizations that focus on the research, prevention, and treatment of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Let our boobs invite you to share a giggle, reflect, and impress on you something new. Then, let’s look beyond the boobs, at the larger picture of what it means to be a woman, a man, a human. Women, this one’s for you. You strong, resilient, gentle, loving yet powerful souls. We look up to your natural beauty and wisdom. Whoever you are, whatever kind of boobs you have, you inherently have the magic.</p>

<h3>The Impact of The Lost Pleiad</h3>
<p>There is an entire community of people in the world who identify as <a href=""https://kellybranyik.com/7-books-every-starseed-needs-to-read-in-this-lifetime/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Starseeds</a>, including myself. What I’ve learned is that many resonate with the teachings of Starseeds and their incredible power for love and intense desire for connection.</p>
<p>When I first learned about Pleiadian Starseeds over seven years ago, I knew this was a book I needed to write. I felt that if I wrote this, I could help this community and the readers around the world feel more connected to one another.<br/><br/>I also believe this book speaks to the sense of loneliness and disconnect we all feel at one point or another, especially when we are on a search for belonging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When people read this book, I want them to feel like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is hope everywhere</li>
<li>You are deeply and universally loved</li>
<li>We are all connected</li>
<li>We are powerful creators</li>
<li>You are here for a purpose</li>

</div></div>","The Impact of The Lost Pleiad
There is an entire community of people in the world who identify as Starseeds, including myself. What I’ve learned is that many resonate with the teachings of Starseeds and their incredible power for love and intense desire for connection.
When I first learned about Pleiadian Starseeds over seven years ago, I knew this was a book I needed to write. I felt that if I wrote this, I could help this community and the readers around the world feel more connected to one another.I also believe this book speaks to the sense of loneliness and disconnect we all feel at one point or another, especially when we are on a search for belonging.
 
When people read this book, I want them to feel like:

There is hope everywhere
You are deeply and universally loved
We are all connected
We are powerful creators
You are here for a purpose

<h3><strong>U-JOINTS project</strong></h3>
<p>An international research project on the theme of connections in design and architecture.<br/><br/>A joint – the union of two or more parts – is a fundamental element in almost any designed object, be it a famous bridge, the coffee maker in your kitchen, or a revolving office chair.</p>
<p>The joint comes in every possible size and material: nanoscale or the size of a room; plastic, steel, carbon fibre, wood or wool. A joint might be ingeniously engineered or the result of garage tinkering. Designers, architects and engineers alike appropriate standard connectors; they assemble and personalise them. Sometimes, they invent new joinery from scratch. Truly multivalent, the joint is the kind of detail that holds the world together.</p>
<p>But because a joint is often invisible, hidden elegantly within an object, it can be overlooked.<br/>U-JOINTS sheds light on these hidden details in an in-depth survey of joints.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611913015/du4gwaujthsjrg6pcjoq.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>U-JOINTS - Equations of a universal lifestyle exhibition, Salone del Mobile, Milano, 2018 ©Delfino Sisto Legnani</i><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611913188/wmohziuosb34ubpeyme7.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>U-JOINTS - Equations of a universal lifestyle exhibition, Salone del Mobile, Milano, 2018 ©Delfino Sisto Legnani</i><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>U-JOINTS background</strong></h3>
<p>The U-JOINTS research project was initiated in 2018 with an exhibition. Called U-JOINTS – Equations of universal life, it took shape as an eclectic introduction to the topic of connections. Curators Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu broke joints open, organised them by material and production processes, reassembled them into prototypes, and used them in real-world applications. For eight days, U-Joints featured 919 exhibits by 50 international designers and industry professionals. On show was everything from the most common joints to design’s most innovative ones, as well as those that have had the greatest influence on contemporary design and architecture.<br/><br/><strong>Encouraged by the exhibition’s success and the remarkable attention and endorsement it garnered, the team launched an extensive research challenge: a comprehensive review of the world’s joints and how they hold things together.</strong><br/><br/>Employing an inclusive and collective approach from the very beginning, the ongoing research is shared with the public through a series of exhibitions in which contemporary designers, researchers, institutions and critics are invited to share their work with joinery.<br/><br/>Each show reads like the chapter of a book.<br/><br/>In 2019, A taxonomy of nails, screws, rivets, bolts and nuts looked at basic fasteners and was held at Galerie l’elac of ECAL/University of Art and Design Lausanne in Switzerland.<br/><br/>Next, Adhesives and Fusions will open to the public on 6 March 2021 at the Gewerbemuseum Winterthur. Further exhibitions are being planned.<br/><br/><strong>Finally, after almost three years of work, we are excited to launch our comprehensive book on the topic. U-Joints – A taxonomy of connections will come out in 2021.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>U-JOINTS  the book</strong></h3>
<p><strong>U-JOINTS – A taxonomy of connections is an encyclopedic publication that looks at human history through its details, and invites us to see our built environment in whole new ways.</strong></p>
<p>Weighing in at more than 900 pages, this is the most far-reaching book ever published on the topic of joints. Comprehensive and interdisciplinary, the book features technical information about joinery as well as stories and commentaries. The heart of the book is a vast taxonomy of more than 1300 joints, organized into six main chapters: Basic fasteners, Mechanical joints, Knits and Knots, Wood joints, Adhesives, and Fused joints.</p>
<p>Each chapter traces the macrocosm of joinery. Together, they create a vast overview of the most common joints as well as insight into joinery’s unique solutions, historical and contemporary. Little known surprises and forgotten connecting methods abound.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the book features 80 essays and interviews, as well as 120 anecdotes. These share the often-unknown stories of joints, from how they were invented to their many inventive applications. The book also includes more than 1000 images, 240 illustrations and numerous patents. 15 new photographic works by young and upcoming photographers reframe the overlooked details for readers to discover.</p>
<p>The book was compiled by a team of more than 50 authors, photographers, illustrators, researchers, experts, scholars, scientists and story tellers, enthusiasts, users, designers, architects, artists, writers and critics, dreamers and makers. Together we hope to bring the many fascinating facets of joints to life.</p>

<h3><strong>U-JOINTS press and comments</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Paola Antonelli, senior curator, MoMA: </strong>""U-Joints has been my favorite stop in Design Week. Curated by Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu, it is an outstanding exhibition on joints and connections. It features an obsessive taxonomy and a thorough timeline. Unadulterated curatorial delight!”</p>
<p><strong>Alice Rawsthorn, design expert:</strong> “You may never confuse a clamp with a coupling, or a dovetail with a rivet again.”</p>
<p><strong>Alice Stori, design curator:</strong> “If you have to see one thing this Salone make it the U-Joints exhibition curated by Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu! Every designer and design student should bring their sketch book and get down to basics.”</p>
<p><strong>Zoë Ryan, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania:</strong> “U-Joints […] examines a multitude of simply that – ways to join things together – through 50 designers’ experiments, prototypes and products. Great show.”</p>
<p><strong>Disegno magazine:</strong> “Curators Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu are to be applauded. On paper, their pitch for U-Joins sounds dry and inaccessible: an exhibition examining a history of the joint and other connecting technologies within design. The results, however, are anything but. U-Joints is engrossing and animated, while nonetheless not shirking the inherent technicality and geekery of its subject matter; it manages the delicate balance of being both a real designer’s design exhibition, while also remaining of interest to a general audience.”</p>
<p><strong>Modern Design Review:</strong> “U-Joints is not only one of the best shows of this year’s Salone, it’s one of the best shows to be presented at the Salone for a long time.”<br/> </p>

<h3><strong>Editors</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Andrea Caputo</strong> is an architect and researcher living in Milan. He combines his professional practise with ongoing research in the architectural and urban planning fields, and has published numerous editorial projects and articles. In 2011, Andrea opened his award-winning architecture studio in Milan and three years later, in 2017, he opened another in Shanghai. His work is recognised for its unexpected solutions, often juxtaposing different materials, which draw attention to the smallest of architectural details. The studio works internationally, developing complex projects on all scales, in collaboration with a qualified network of specialist consultants. His first investigation into urban culture’s aesthetic and social influences was published as All City Writers (Critique Livre, 2009) and soon became a sought-after reference work for street culture. From 2018-19, he edited Domus magazine's ""Studio Visit"" column, which explored contemporary architecture studios’ practices. Currently, Andrea’s studio is engaged on behalf of the Vastushilpa Foundation of Ahmedabab to conduct a vast survey on the architecture of Balkrishna Doshi, Pritzker Prize 2018. <a href=""https://www.andreacaputo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.andreacaputo.com</a><br/><br/><strong>Anniina Koivu</strong> is a design writer, curator, consultant and teacher, who divides her time between Milan and Lausanne. She works across a number of fields, from curation to art direction, product development, and editorial and research projects, which she develops for clients such as Kvadrat, Iittala, Vitra, Camper and the Shorefast Foundation of Fogo Island. Her latest publication is Vico Magistretti: Stories of Objects (Ecal/Triest, 2020), the result of an investigation of the little-considered moment in the lifespan of design products when production ends, with a focus on the reasons that lead up to this ‘death’ of the design object. She wrote the comprehensive monograph on Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec Works (Phaidon, 2011) and has edited and contributed to a number of publications such Materialising Colour: Journeys with Giulio Ridolfo (Phaidon, 2020), Atlas of Furniture Design (Vitra Design Museum, 2019), Industrial Facility (Phaidon, 2018), Arita 2016/ (Phaidon, 2017), The Walking Society (Lars Müller, 2015) and Pierre Charpin's Entre Les Vases (Birkhäuser, 2009) among others. Serving as editor-in-chief, Anniina launched the first print issue of Interwoven (Kvadrat, 2020), an (online) magazine on contemporary culture and independent criticism. Among her recent curatorial works are Tehdas – Fabrik – Factory (Fiskars Village Art &amp; Design Biennale, 2019), an exhibition exploring the diversity of contemporary design production, and Typologie: the wine bottle and the cork stopper (Milan, 2019). She has been a speaker, moderator and juror at international design competitions and events. She is Head of Master Theory at University of Art and Design Lausanne ECAL. <a href=""http://www.anniinakoivu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.anniinakoivu.com</a><br/> </p>

An international research project on the theme of connections in design and architecture.A joint – the union of two or more parts – is a fundamental element in almost any designed object, be it a famous bridge, the coffee maker in your kitchen, or a revolving office chair.
The joint comes in every possible size and material: nanoscale or the size of a room; plastic, steel, carbon fibre, wood or wool. A joint might be ingeniously engineered or the result of garage tinkering. Designers, architects and engineers alike appropriate standard connectors; they assemble and personalise them. Sometimes, they invent new joinery from scratch. Truly multivalent, the joint is the kind of detail that holds the world together.
But because a joint is often invisible, hidden elegantly within an object, it can be overlooked.U-JOINTS sheds light on these hidden details in an in-depth survey of joints.U-JOINTS - Equations of a universal lifestyle exhibition, Salone del Mobile, Milano, 2018 ©Delfino Sisto LegnaniU-JOINTS - Equations of a universal lifestyle exhibition, Salone del Mobile, Milano, 2018 ©Delfino Sisto Legnani 

U-JOINTS background
The U-JOINTS research project was initiated in 2018 with an exhibition. Called U-JOINTS – Equations of universal life, it took shape as an eclectic introduction to the topic of connections. Curators Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu broke joints open, organised them by material and production processes, reassembled them into prototypes, and used them in real-world applications. For eight days, U-Joints featured 919 exhibits by 50 international designers and industry professionals. On show was everything from the most common joints to design’s most innovative ones, as well as those that have had the greatest influence on contemporary design and architecture.Encouraged by the exhibition’s success and the remarkable attention and endorsement it garnered, the team launched an extensive research challenge: a comprehensive review of the world’s joints and how they hold things together.Employing an inclusive and collective approach from the very beginning, the ongoing research is shared with the public through a series of exhibitions in which contemporary designers, researchers, institutions and critics are invited to share their work with joinery.Each show reads like the chapter of a book.In 2019, A taxonomy of nails, screws, rivets, bolts and nuts looked at basic fasteners and was held at Galerie l’elac of ECAL/University of Art and Design Lausanne in Switzerland.Next, Adhesives and Fusions will open to the public on 6 March 2021 at the Gewerbemuseum Winterthur. Further exhibitions are being planned.Finally, after almost three years of work, we are excited to launch our comprehensive book on the topic. U-Joints – A taxonomy of connections will come out in 2021.

U-JOINTS  the book
U-JOINTS – A taxonomy of connections is an encyclopedic publication that looks at human history through its details, and invites us to see our built environment in whole new ways.
Weighing in at more than 900 pages, this is the most far-reaching book ever published on the topic of joints. Comprehensive and interdisciplinary, the book features technical information about joinery as well as stories and commentaries. The heart of the book is a vast taxonomy of more than 1300 joints, organized into six main chapters: Basic fasteners, Mechanical joints, Knits and Knots, Wood joints, Adhesives, and Fused joints.
Each chapter traces the macrocosm of joinery. Together, they create a vast overview of the most common joints as well as insight into joinery’s unique solutions, historical and contemporary. Little known surprises and forgotten connecting methods abound.
Furthermore, the book features 80 essays and interviews, as well as 120 anecdotes. These share the often-unknown stories of joints, from how they were invented to their many inventive applications. The book also includes more than 1000 images, 240 illustrations and numerous patents. 15 new photographic works by young and upcoming photographers reframe the overlooked details for readers to discover.
The book was compiled by a team of more than 50 authors, photographers, illustrators, researchers, experts, scholars, scientists and story tellers, enthusiasts, users, designers, architects, artists, writers and critics, dreamers and makers. Together we hope to bring the many fascinating facets of joints to life.

Each chapter constitutes a proposal: by looking at particular details, we can help you understand the constructed world a little better. As a result, this publication is many things: a manual in a workshop, an encyclopedic reference guide for scholars and design enthusiasts, as well as an indispensable resource for students of architecture and design. 
U-JOINTS press and comments
Paola Antonelli, senior curator, MoMA: ""U-Joints has been my favorite stop in Design Week. Curated by Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu, it is an outstanding exhibition on joints and connections. It features an obsessive taxonomy and a thorough timeline. Unadulterated curatorial delight!”
Alice Rawsthorn, design expert: “You may never confuse a clamp with a coupling, or a dovetail with a rivet again.”
Alice Stori, design curator: “If you have to see one thing this Salone make it the U-Joints exhibition curated by Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu! Every designer and design student should bring their sketch book and get down to basics.”
Zoë Ryan, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania: “U-Joints […] examines a multitude of simply that – ways to join things together – through 50 designers’ experiments, prototypes and products. Great show.”
Disegno magazine: “Curators Andrea Caputo and Anniina Koivu are to be applauded. On paper, their pitch for U-Joins sounds dry and inaccessible: an exhibition examining a history of the joint and other connecting technologies within design. The results, however, are anything but. U-Joints is engrossing and animated, while nonetheless not shirking the inherent technicality and geekery of its subject matter; it manages the delicate balance of being both a real designer’s design exhibition, while also remaining of interest to a general audience.”
Modern Design Review: “U-Joints is not only one of the best shows of this year’s Salone, it’s one of the best shows to be presented at the Salone for a long time.”

<p>Religion has shaped the history of mankind. With SCARED SACRED, House of Leaves hopes to incite and further discussion surrounding the influence of religion upon popular culture via the cinematic church of horror.</p>
<p>The book developed in response to the recent reclaiming of supernatural and religious themes in mainstream horror cinema. This is reflected thematically; the book is divided into four sections to provide a well-rounded analysis of world religions, idolatry and worship. <br/><br/>SCARED SACRED is edited by Rebecca Booth (author of The Devil Rides Out [Auteur Publishing]), Erin Thompson (owner of The Backseat Driver Reviews), and RF Todd (Managing Director of House of Leaves).<br/><br/>The cover is based on original artwork from illustrator Jeremy Thompson, which takes inspiration from the designs of the late Simon Sayce. With digital artwork by John Sowder, and design layout by Euan Monaghan, the cover will be foiled in silver. Each chapter will also be accompanied by original illustrations from illustrator John Sowder in a beautiful Medieval wood-cut style.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong><i>Idolatry, Religion and Worship in the Horror Film</i></strong><br/>by Professor Douglas E Cowan<br/> </p>
<h3>Section One: Christianity</h3>
<p><strong><i>Onward Christian Soldiers: Eyes of Believers in The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjuring 2 (2016)</i></strong><br/>by Alexandra West</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the creeping conservative values at play within James Wan's <i>The Conjuring</i> (2013) and <i>The Conjuring 2</i> (2016). Utilizing the controversial real-life figures of Ed and Lorraine Warren as the protagonists of both films, Wan has sanitized their history in favor of upholding patriarchal Christian values. The chapter examines filmic nostalgia, conservative Christian values, and how these elements combine in an attempt to make horror great again. </p>
<p><i><strong>“I don't know if we've got the heir to the Thorn millions here or Jesus Christ himself”: Catholicism, Satanism and the Role of Predestination in The Omen (1976)</strong></i><br/>by Dr LMK Sheppard</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on how <i>The Omen</i> (1976), as a representation of New Hollywood Horror, acts as both an agent within this socio-political environment and a disseminator of its message and values. In addressing cultural and religious neo-liberal and conservative debates—involving the role of free will and its opposites, determinism and predestination—the film in many ways challenges this liberty of choice. Like the culture out of which it arises, <i>The Omen </i>may be regarded as being not only conflictual, but also conflicted.</p>
<p><i><strong>As God is My Witness: Martyrdom in Modern-Day Horror</strong></i><br/>by Andrea Subissati</p>
<p><i>The Exorcism of Emily Rose </i>(2005) and <i>Martyrs</i> (2008) tackle the subject of modern-day martyrdom in diverse and theologically nuanced ways. This chapter seeks to unpack the convoluted term “martyr” by drawing from its etymological origins, and tracing its redefinition across history. Culminating in an examination of both films—with an aim to isolate the differing conceptions of martyrdom and the resulting cultural impact of those conceptions—this analysis illustrates that the figure of the martyr is far from antiquated, no matter how far removed from its theological origin.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Last Sin Eater: The Hellraiser Mythology as the Hell Priest’s Purgatory</strong></i><br/>by Rebecca Booth</p>
<p>This chapter charts the development of the Hell Priest—often referred to as “Pinhead”—across the Hellraiser mythology. The portrayal of the figure in Clive Barker’s seminal novella<i> The Hellbound Heart</i> (1986) is analysed against further literary instalments, as well as the cinematic translation of the character, and its further evolution across popular culture. As an inversion of the traditional mediatory role of the clergyman, the Hell Priest is truly the last sin eater; he does not absolve sin, but feeds upon it as he condemns and collects souls. Taking into account the character’s human backstory in relation to several tangential storylines within the franchise, the Hellraiser mythology is explored as the Hell Priest’s own purgatory.<br/> </p>
<h3>Section Two: Mysticism</h3>
<p><i><strong>Needful Things: Buddhism and Gender in Onibaba (1964) and Nang Nak (1999)</strong></i><br/>by Erin Thompson</p>
<p>This chapter explores the gender politics and social customs of spiritual fulfilment and balance amid the background of the religious traditions within Buddhism in <i>Onibaba</i> (1964) and <i>Nang Nak</i> (1999). The films present the disconcerting theme of a female practitioner requiring a male counterpart to achieve full spiritual potential, highlighting and reinforcing a combination of Buddhist perceptions and principles in regards to gender inequality through the devices of the vengeful spirit and the repentant religious.</p>
<p><i><strong>Between Two Worlds: Semitic Soul Transmigration in The Dybbuk (1937) and Demon (2015)</strong></i><br/>by Rebecca Booth</p>
<p>Despite references to the dybbuk, a once-human spirit that possesses the living to accomplish a malicious goal, in 16th century Jewish writings, the figure was not embraced by popular culture until Shloyme Zanvl Rappoport published his play The Dybbuk in 1918, under the pseudonym S. Ansky. Drawing on Jewish folklore, this chapter compares the figure in <i>The Dybbuk</i> (1937), Michał Waszyński’s classic cinematic adaptation of Ansky’s play, against Marcin Wrona’s <i>Demon</i> (2015), exploring the resonation of soul transfiguration in each. In particular, the chapter examines the marital unions in both films as a site of tension between traditional and cultural values, and in terms of gender politics and how the past informs the present—even when buried.</p>
<p><i><strong>From the Stake to the Sanitarium: Taming the Unruly Feminine in Häxan (1922) and Antichrist (2009)</strong></i><br/>by Valeska Griffiths</p>
<p>Few historical figures are as evocative as that of the witch. Social discourses surrounding the figure have provided long-lasting ramifications, and with the shift from the Medieval to the Modern era, the figure of the witch has also undergone an evolution. Through examining Benjamin Christensen's <i>Häxan</i> (1922) and Lars von Trier's <i>Antichrist</i> (2009), the lineage from witch to hysteric, and the psychic harm that these discourses have inflicted—and continue to inflict—can be traced and understood.</p>
<p><i><strong>Monstrous Realism: Irreligious Religion in Lovecraft’s Cosmic Horror</strong></i><br/>by Anya Stanley</p>
<p>H. P. Lovecraft’s works are largely referential to and focused around a constructed religion from the depths of his own mind. Commonly termed the Cthulhu Mythos by later contributors to this universe, this observational framework is rooted in non-spirituality and a matter-of-fact delivery of revelations concerning multiple amoral entities that humans can barely behold, let alone understand. When taken contextually with Lovecraft’s unashamed condemnations of organized religion, the Cthulhu Mythos is a bleak reflection of his own spiritual attitude towards both faith and contemporary advancements in science. Further, the cosmic horror popularized by literary pillars such as Lovecraft, Arthur Machen, and R. W. Chambers mirrors the common fears of atheists, including ultimate human insignificance, hyperawareness of frailty and mortality, and the great dark void itself. This chapter references many films that are both Lovecraft-tangential and direct adaptations of his work, with a central focus on <i>From Beyond </i>(1986) and <i>In the Mouth of Madness</i> (1994) for their emphasis on (anti)religious themes. Amid all of the horror films that find monstrosity in religion and zealotry, cosmicism's lack of belief is a jarring contrast that is nonetheless terrifying in its unflinching amorality, hence its unwavering popularity in the horror genre. This chapter, in its atheistic focus, serves to provide a counterbalance to the various religious lens being applied to horror cinema in SCARED SACRED.<br/> </p>
<h3>Section Three: Occultism</h3>
<p><i><strong>“Not everything that moves, breathes and talks is alive”: Christianity, Korean Shamanism and Reincarnation in Whispering Corridors (1998) and The Wailing (2016)</strong></i><br/>by Frazer Lee</p>
<p>This chapter covers the conflict between Christianity and Korean Shamanism via the subject of reincarnation. Park Ki-hyung’s <i>Whispering Corridors</i> (1998) positions the artistic freedom of post-dictatorship South Korea and its differing religious belief systems against increasingly brutal educational regimes, using reincarnation as both a plot device and a thematic note of hope for the emotionally and physically abused/abusing characters. Na Hong-jin’s <i>The Wailing </i>(2016) reflects Christian guilt through the lens of Korean horror, positioning Korean Shamanism as an occult threat by spreading evil to seemingly utopian rural areas via the shaman and accomplice, a direct mirror of the Catholic priest and his acolyte. In viewing how the notion of reincarnation explodes the South Korean obsession with Christianity, this chapter also explores how the horror film reflects the tension between these two belief systems, each competing for dominance in both the spiritual and socio-political realms.</p>
<p><i><strong>Deprogramming the Program: The Image and Anxiety of the Religious Cult in the Made for Television Film</strong></i><br/>by Amanda Reyes</p>
<p>As a tool for mass consumption, the television film is at its most influential when working with images of domestic spaces and family. Concentrating on the telefilms <i>Can Ellen Be Saved </i>(1974) and <i>Blinded by the Light</i> (1980), this chapter explores the ways in which cults are portrayed as symbols of the anxieties that arose during an era of rising divorce rates and broken homes, and how the made-for-television film employs those images as a tool to reinforce the nuclear family, which is treated as the ultimate iconography of a higher power.</p>
<p><i><strong>I Believe in Death: William Peter Blatty and the Horror of Faith in The Ninth Configuration (1980) and Exorcist III (1990)</strong></i><br/>by Samm Deighan</p>
<p>Though William Peter Blatty achieved fame with the 1973 adaptation of his novel, <i>The Exorcist</i>, his work as a director has long been overlooked. This chapter will primarily focus on the two films Blatty helmed: <i>The Ninth Configuration</i> (1980) and <i>Exorcist III</i> (1990), both adaptations of his own novels that explore themes of madness, violence and horror. These films explore the inevitable consequences when men of belief and faith confront evil within the nihilistic modern world, whether that manifests as satanic possession, serial murder, or insanity as the result of trauma.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Last Temptation: Demonic Warfare and Supernatural Sacrifice in The Amityville Horror (1979) and When the Lights Went Out (2012)</strong></i><br/>by Erin Thompson</p>
<p>The anxiety-inducing topic of demonic invasion and possession persists across world cultures. After a resurgence of interest in the 1960s to 1980s, tales of possession and supernatural occurrences began to manifest in cinema. In particular, <i>The Amityville Horror</i> (1979) and <i>When the Lights Went Out </i>(2012) portray alleged real-life events that chart a pattern of supernatural disturbance, possession and affirmation of faith. This chapter bridges the two films by means of the Biblical notion of temptation and sacrifice, as demonstrated in the tale of Abraham in the Book of Genesis.<br/> </p>
<h3>Section Four: Beyond Belief</h3>
<p><i><strong>A Taste for Blood and Truth: Bill Gunn's Ganja and Hess (1973)</strong></i><br/>by Dr John Cussans</p>
<p>Often discussed as an audacious subversion of the Blaxploitation genre by a maverick Black director, Bill Gunn’s 1973 “vampire film” <i>Ganja and Hess</i> is a complex meditation on the psychology of race, religion, sex, class and addiction in 1970’s America. The narrative is framed as a conflict between the redemptive power of the blood of Christ offered by the Black Church, and a fantasy of ancestral African sovereignty represented by the Myrthian blood-cult. The film is also an important vehicle for Gunn’s personal experiences as a Black artist struggling for creative autonomy and critical recognition in a white-run culture industry, and living with the damaging psychological consequences of existing between seemingly incompatible worlds. Drawing specifically on the Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe’s writings on Blackness, this chapter discusses the religious and moral meanings of <i>Ganja and Hess </i>from the perspectives of its lead characters and the lives of the actors who played them.</p>
<p><i><strong>Zoolatry and the Feline Fatale: Obsession, Femininity and Revenge in Cat People (1942) and Kuroneko (1968)</strong></i><br/>by Joseph Dwyer</p>
<p>In Jacques Tourneur’s production of <i>Cat People</i> (1942), a woman is ominously cursed by her feline ancestors. In Kaneto Shindo's <i>Kuroneko</i> (1968), supernatural cats act as avengers of women who are violated and murdered. Much like the femme, the feline fatale is a simultaneously lauded and condemned figure across cultural and historical boundaries. These two films incorporate elements of feline shape-shifting within their cultural mythos, which belie the fabricated reality of religions and other belief systems like psychoanalysis; folklore—including cinema—is revealed to be as equally important as religion. </p>
<p><i><strong>Faith and Idolatry in the Abrahamic Religions: Security through Symbols in Seytan (1974) and Jinn (2014)</strong></i><br/>by Neil Gravino</p>
<p>The use of idolatry in defense against otherworldly horrors has cemented itself as one of the most common tropes of the horror genre. Often, idolatry takes the form of the placement of faith—bordering on superstition—on symbols of a religious nature, such as a cross or statue. This version of idolatry often renders itself ineffective, a narrative device used to raise the stakes and present evil as a credible threat. This chapter frames idolatry as a sinful act, and its accompanying sense of protection ineffectual, within the Abrahamic belief systems portrayed in <i>Seytan</i> (1974) and <i>Jinn</i> (2014). The films argue that placing faith in symbols rather than Abrahamic teachings and beliefs can leave one vulnerable to evil, a loaded reading in today’s socio-political climate. In both films, idolatry is replaced by physical action, presenting evil as a pervasive threat that believers must be constantly ready to confront, regardless of faith.</p>
<p><i><strong>Prophetic Voices and the Lethal Hand of the God: The Religious Zealotry of Frailty (2001)</strong></i><br/>by Chris Hallock</p>
<p>This chapter examines Bill Paxton's <i>Frailty</i> (2001), a psychological horror film steeped in the southern gothic tradition. Surveying how the film's non-linear framework enhances its religious and familial themes, it also studies the director's ambiguous approach to the material, ensnaring the story's tightly-knit family in the disastrous clutches of religious zealotry, murderous fanaticism and toxic patriarchy.</p>

</div></div>","SCARED SACRED

Religion has shaped the history of mankind. With SCARED SACRED, House of Leaves hopes to incite and further discussion surrounding the influence of religion upon popular culture via the cinematic church of horror.
The book developed in response to the recent reclaiming of supernatural and religious themes in mainstream horror cinema. This is reflected thematically; the book is divided into four sections to provide a well-rounded analysis of world religions, idolatry and worship. SCARED SACRED is edited by Rebecca Booth (author of The Devil Rides Out [Auteur Publishing]), Erin Thompson (owner of The Backseat Driver Reviews), and RF Todd (Managing Director of House of Leaves).The cover is based on original artwork from illustrator Jeremy Thompson, which takes inspiration from the designs of the late Simon Sayce. With digital artwork by John Sowder, and design layout by Euan Monaghan, the cover will be foiled in silver. Each chapter will also be accompanied by original illustrations from illustrator John Sowder in a beautiful Medieval wood-cut style.

SCARED SACRED is due for release early in 2019 and the purpose of this crowdfunding campaign is to allow supporters to pre-order a first edition copy of the book. The first edition run is limited to 500 copies, with only 100 copies of the hardback edition (including an alternative cover foiled in copper) available. Each book will be accompanied by a numbered certificate.
Contents

Introduction
Idolatry, Religion and Worship in the Horror Filmby Professor Douglas E Cowan 
Section One: Christianity
Onward Christian Soldiers: Eyes of Believers in The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjuring 2 (2016)by Alexandra West
This chapter focuses on the creeping conservative values at play within James Wan's The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjuring 2 (2016). Utilizing the controversial real-life figures of Ed and Lorraine Warren as the protagonists of both films, Wan has sanitized their history in favor of upholding patriarchal Christian values. The chapter examines filmic nostalgia, conservative Christian values, and how these elements combine in an attempt to make horror great again. 
“I don't know if we've got the heir to the Thorn millions here or Jesus Christ himself”: Catholicism, Satanism and the Role of Predestination in The Omen (1976)by Dr LMK Sheppard
This chapter focuses on how The Omen (1976), as a representation of New Hollywood Horror, acts as both an agent within this socio-political environment and a disseminator of its message and values. In addressing cultural and religious neo-liberal and conservative debates—involving the role of free will and its opposites, determinism and predestination—the film in many ways challenges this liberty of choice. Like the culture out of which it arises, The Omen may be regarded as being not only conflictual, but also conflicted.
As God is My Witness: Martyrdom in Modern-Day Horrorby Andrea Subissati
The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) and Martyrs (2008) tackle the subject of modern-day martyrdom in diverse and theologically nuanced ways. This chapter seeks to unpack the convoluted term “martyr” by drawing from its etymological origins, and tracing its redefinition across history. Culminating in an examination of both films—with an aim to isolate the differing conceptions of martyrdom and the resulting cultural impact of those conceptions—this analysis illustrates that the figure of the martyr is far from antiquated, no matter how far removed from its theological origin.
The Last Sin Eater: The Hellraiser Mythology as the Hell Priest’s Purgatoryby Rebecca Booth
This chapter charts the development of the Hell Priest—often referred to as “Pinhead”—across the Hellraiser mythology. The portrayal of the figure in Clive Barker’s seminal novella The Hellbound Heart (1986) is analysed against further literary instalments, as well as the cinematic translation of the character, and its further evolution across popular culture. As an inversion of the traditional mediatory role of the clergyman, the Hell Priest is truly the last sin eater; he does not absolve sin, but feeds upon it as he condemns and collects souls. Taking into account the character’s human backstory in relation to several tangential storylines within the franchise, the Hellraiser mythology is explored as the Hell Priest’s own purgatory. 
Section Two: Mysticism
Needful Things: Buddhism and Gender in Onibaba (1964) and Nang Nak (1999)by Erin Thompson
This chapter explores the gender politics and social customs of spiritual fulfilment and balance amid the background of the religious traditions within Buddhism in Onibaba (1964) and Nang Nak (1999). The films present the disconcerting theme of a female practitioner requiring a male counterpart to achieve full spiritual potential, highlighting and reinforcing a combination of Buddhist perceptions and principles in regards to gender inequality through the devices of the vengeful spirit and the repentant religious.
Between Two Worlds: Semitic Soul Transmigration in The Dybbuk (1937) and Demon (2015)by Rebecca Booth
Despite references to the dybbuk, a once-human spirit that possesses the living to accomplish a malicious goal, in 16th century Jewish writings, the figure was not embraced by popular culture until Shloyme Zanvl Rappoport published his play The Dybbuk in 1918, under the pseudonym S. Ansky. Drawing on Jewish folklore, this chapter compares the figure in The Dybbuk (1937), Michał Waszyński’s classic cinematic adaptation of Ansky’s play, against Marcin Wrona’s Demon (2015), exploring the resonation of soul transfiguration in each. In particular, the chapter examines the marital unions in both films as a site of tension between traditional and cultural values, and in terms of gender politics and how the past informs the present—even when buried.
From the Stake to the Sanitarium: Taming the Unruly Feminine in Häxan (1922) and Antichrist (2009)by Valeska Griffiths
Few historical figures are as evocative as that of the witch. Social discourses surrounding the figure have provided long-lasting ramifications, and with the shift from the Medieval to the Modern era, the figure of the witch has also undergone an evolution. Through examining Benjamin Christensen's Häxan (1922) and Lars von Trier's Antichrist (2009), the lineage from witch to hysteric, and the psychic harm that these discourses have inflicted—and continue to inflict—can be traced and understood.
Monstrous Realism: Irreligious Religion in Lovecraft’s Cosmic Horrorby Anya Stanley
H. P. Lovecraft’s works are largely referential to and focused around a constructed religion from the depths of his own mind. Commonly termed the Cthulhu Mythos by later contributors to this universe, this observational framework is rooted in non-spirituality and a matter-of-fact delivery of revelations concerning multiple amoral entities that humans can barely behold, let alone understand. When taken contextually with Lovecraft’s unashamed condemnations of organized religion, the Cthulhu Mythos is a bleak reflection of his own spiritual attitude towards both faith and contemporary advancements in science. Further, the cosmic horror popularized by literary pillars such as Lovecraft, Arthur Machen, and R. W. Chambers mirrors the common fears of atheists, including ultimate human insignificance, hyperawareness of frailty and mortality, and the great dark void itself. This chapter references many films that are both Lovecraft-tangential and direct adaptations of his work, with a central focus on From Beyond (1986) and In the Mouth of Madness (1994) for their emphasis on (anti)religious themes. Amid all of the horror films that find monstrosity in religion and zealotry, cosmicism's lack of belief is a jarring contrast that is nonetheless terrifying in its unflinching amorality, hence its unwavering popularity in the horror genre. This chapter, in its atheistic focus, serves to provide a counterbalance to the various religious lens being applied to horror cinema in SCARED SACRED. 
Section Three: Occultism
“Not everything that moves, breathes and talks is alive”: Christianity, Korean Shamanism and Reincarnation in Whispering Corridors (1998) and The Wailing (2016)by Frazer Lee
This chapter covers the conflict between Christianity and Korean Shamanism via the subject of reincarnation. Park Ki-hyung’s Whispering Corridors (1998) positions the artistic freedom of post-dictatorship South Korea and its differing religious belief systems against increasingly brutal educational regimes, using reincarnation as both a plot device and a thematic note of hope for the emotionally and physically abused/abusing characters. Na Hong-jin’s The Wailing (2016) reflects Christian guilt through the lens of Korean horror, positioning Korean Shamanism as an occult threat by spreading evil to seemingly utopian rural areas via the shaman and accomplice, a direct mirror of the Catholic priest and his acolyte. In viewing how the notion of reincarnation explodes the South Korean obsession with Christianity, this chapter also explores how the horror film reflects the tension between these two belief systems, each competing for dominance in both the spiritual and socio-political realms.
Deprogramming the Program: The Image and Anxiety of the Religious Cult in the Made for Television Filmby Amanda Reyes
As a tool for mass consumption, the television film is at its most influential when working with images of domestic spaces and family. Concentrating on the telefilms Can Ellen Be Saved (1974) and Blinded by the Light (1980), this chapter explores the ways in which cults are portrayed as symbols of the anxieties that arose during an era of rising divorce rates and broken homes, and how the made-for-television film employs those images as a tool to reinforce the nuclear family, which is treated as the ultimate iconography of a higher power.
I Believe in Death: William Peter Blatty and the Horror of Faith in The Ninth Configuration (1980) and Exorcist III (1990)by Samm Deighan
Though William Peter Blatty achieved fame with the 1973 adaptation of his novel, The Exorcist, his work as a director has long been overlooked. This chapter will primarily focus on the two films Blatty helmed: The Ninth Configuration (1980) and Exorcist III (1990), both adaptations of his own novels that explore themes of madness, violence and horror. These films explore the inevitable consequences when men of belief and faith confront evil within the nihilistic modern world, whether that manifests as satanic possession, serial murder, or insanity as the result of trauma.
The Last Temptation: Demonic Warfare and Supernatural Sacrifice in The Amityville Horror (1979) and When the Lights Went Out (2012)by Erin Thompson
The anxiety-inducing topic of demonic invasion and possession persists across world cultures. After a resurgence of interest in the 1960s to 1980s, tales of possession and supernatural occurrences began to manifest in cinema. In particular, The Amityville Horror (1979) and When the Lights Went Out (2012) portray alleged real-life events that chart a pattern of supernatural disturbance, possession and affirmation of faith. This chapter bridges the two films by means of the Biblical notion of temptation and sacrifice, as demonstrated in the tale of Abraham in the Book of Genesis. 
Section Four: Beyond Belief
A Taste for Blood and Truth: Bill Gunn's Ganja and Hess (1973)by Dr John Cussans
Often discussed as an audacious subversion of the Blaxploitation genre by a maverick Black director, Bill Gunn’s 1973 “vampire film” Ganja and Hess is a complex meditation on the psychology of race, religion, sex, class and addiction in 1970’s America. The narrative is framed as a conflict between the redemptive power of the blood of Christ offered by the Black Church, and a fantasy of ancestral African sovereignty represented by the Myrthian blood-cult. The film is also an important vehicle for Gunn’s personal experiences as a Black artist struggling for creative autonomy and critical recognition in a white-run culture industry, and living with the damaging psychological consequences of existing between seemingly incompatible worlds. Drawing specifically on the Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe’s writings on Blackness, this chapter discusses the religious and moral meanings of Ganja and Hess from the perspectives of its lead characters and the lives of the actors who played them.
Zoolatry and the Feline Fatale: Obsession, Femininity and Revenge in Cat People (1942) and Kuroneko (1968)by Joseph Dwyer
In Jacques Tourneur’s production of Cat People (1942), a woman is ominously cursed by her feline ancestors. In Kaneto Shindo's Kuroneko (1968), supernatural cats act as avengers of women who are violated and murdered. Much like the femme, the feline fatale is a simultaneously lauded and condemned figure across cultural and historical boundaries. These two films incorporate elements of feline shape-shifting within their cultural mythos, which belie the fabricated reality of religions and other belief systems like psychoanalysis; folklore—including cinema—is revealed to be as equally important as religion. 
Faith and Idolatry in the Abrahamic Religions: Security through Symbols in Seytan (1974) and Jinn (2014)by Neil Gravino
The use of idolatry in defense against otherworldly horrors has cemented itself as one of the most common tropes of the horror genre. Often, idolatry takes the form of the placement of faith—bordering on superstition—on symbols of a religious nature, such as a cross or statue. This version of idolatry often renders itself ineffective, a narrative device used to raise the stakes and present evil as a credible threat. This chapter frames idolatry as a sinful act, and its accompanying sense of protection ineffectual, within the Abrahamic belief systems portrayed in Seytan (1974) and Jinn (2014). The films argue that placing faith in symbols rather than Abrahamic teachings and beliefs can leave one vulnerable to evil, a loaded reading in today’s socio-political climate. In both films, idolatry is replaced by physical action, presenting evil as a pervasive threat that believers must be constantly ready to confront, regardless of faith.
Prophetic Voices and the Lethal Hand of the God: The Religious Zealotry of Frailty (2001)by Chris Hallock
This chapter examines Bill Paxton's Frailty (2001), a psychological horror film steeped in the southern gothic tradition. Surveying how the film's non-linear framework enhances its religious and familial themes, it also studies the director's ambiguous approach to the material, ensnaring the story's tightly-knit family in the disastrous clutches of religious zealotry, murderous fanaticism and toxic patriarchy.

What We Need & What You Get
While we do have a set goal, the overall intent is to fulfill the perks you donate for and then to use the net profit to pay all contributors. Yes, 100% of the net profit goes to the content creators, meaning when you back this project you are paying the authors directly.
There are only a few options for perks for this project. Why? Because it's a book and we're a new company trying to establish ourselves. With your help, we can do that.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't back the campaign we completely understand. Now is a trying time for a love of people. But you can still help us out by sharing the campaign on social media and telling anyone you know that reads about it. Word of mouth is still the most effective way to spread the news around.
You can also help us by posting a review of the book in the future. We, and the contributors, would appreciate that.

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I need your help in publishing an excellent</strong> <strong>software testing book in English AND in Finnish for kids and adults</strong>. <strong>It will be both a fantasy book with dragons and knights AND an introductory book about software testing</strong>. <strong>The main target group is kids of 10-15 years old, but the book is suitable for ages of 10-99, so adults, too!</strong> Age of ten is the traditional age to start reading fantasy books, Also at that age, technology becomes interesting. This book will extend that interest to software testing. I believe the best way to do it is to tell stories that are interesting on their own – the book “Dragons Out!”. </p>
<p><strong>The book is almost ready in Finnish and just needs illustration and translation to English.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Mr. Kari Kakkonen and I’ve been working in the software testing industry for over twenty years. All that time I’ve also spent a considerable part of my free time to voluntary, non-profit activities around software testing, currently elected as the Secretary of ISTQB, globally. I’ve written numerous blogs and co-authored Agile Testing Foundations book. This new book is my effort to reach towards children with the software testing topic.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s teach software testing to the new generations, to contribute to better software and better quality of life in our world. So buy the book and share this campaign to everyone!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The book</strong></h3>
<p>At the time of the writing of this, I have finished the first draft of the book in Finnish. I will write an English version immediately after. I have found an amazing illustrator, Adrienn Széll, to draw fantastic pictures to bring the book alive. Next tasks include finding a designer, editor, and publisher.</p>
<p><strong>The book tells a growth story of two 10-year old children</strong>, Laura and Tom, from kids into knight apprentices. <strong>They learn about dragons and knights fighting those dragons, and get into real action themselves, too</strong>. They get help from male and female knights and a wise old sage. The stories take place in a setting resembling medieval Europe. As these fantasy stories unfold, <strong>I explain to the readers the software development and testing world in analogies or parallels.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566905117/qqve7q7vzfqhvetyqkcy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Each chapter introduces another type of dragon, which represents a software defect/bug in the real world. Knights represent software testers and developers. </strong>Villagers and the two children represent software users. And so on. Everything is an analogy. Obviously, the knights and villagers want the dragons out of their towns and villages, hence also the name of the book “Dragons Out!”.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of dragon story in the book draft translated into English:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:65.2pt;""><i>At night, Sebastian woke the children and they walked to the guard post. Sky was full of bright stars, but otherwise the only light came from Sebastian’s torch. Cypress scent was in the air. For a long time you couldn’t hear anything but rustle of the wind in the trees and crickets chirping. Suddenly Laura startled, when Sebastian shook her shoulder. There were flames a few houses away. They walked carefully closer. One wall of the house was about to collapse. Flames were getting stronger. They saw a dark shape hovering in front of the fire. It had black wings and tall winding tail. Now it breathed fire towards another part of the wall, which burst into flames. It was a dragon!</i></p>
<p>And here's a sample of testing explanation in the book draft translated into English:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:65.2pt;""><i>In the story, the team of knights found and killed the dragon. In real life, the software development team together (developers and testers) was able to find, locate and fix the defect. They shared tasks in a way that everyone helped each other using their special skills. In the story, Knight Swanlake was talented in finding dragons. In real world, she was better in testing than the rest of her team members, which was why at this time she found the defect. In the story, Knight Yellowbeard was good at building the palisade, and figuring out ways to kill dragons. In real life, his coding skills were excellent, so he thought of the way to remove the defect. </i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566905189/jpvngl54lpzouxg2rdaj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The structure of the book is straightforward. In each chapter, I first tell a fantasy story of a new dragon, and how it is banished from the village. My storytelling is complemented with the amazing illustration from Adri. I explain the analogy of the story into software testing and development in side-boxes that are available for reading as one reads the story, or afterwards.</strong> How is this kind of software defect found through testing? Why is it harmful to software? How can it be removed? As new computer, testing or development terms are mentioned, I explain them as simply as possible in a <strong>vocabulary</strong>. In the end of each chapter there are a few <strong>exercises </strong>for learning the software testing topics a bit better.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566905228/mm3fpwaxhct2sl8rcll9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The book is such an interesting piece of adventure fantasy that it is impossible to stop reading it. <strong>My 10-year-old beta readers of the various chapters of the book have encouraged me to publish the book.</strong> They say the story is catching and they would like to read more of the same. The understanding and interest of software testing come as a natural by-product. <strong>My adult beta readers from software testing, teaching and other backgrounds also praise this as unique and interesting approach that will be a success.</strong> They think the story is good and software testing is explained very clearly. They also tend to laugh at some of the analogies in the book. The more you know about software development, the more you can appreciate how information technology concepts turn into a fantasy. I have infused the stories with the analogies, something I have practiced in my blogs over the years. The readers can return to the book over and over again, to understand the software testing via the used analogies. Examples, in general, are usually one of the best ways to learn. <strong>The book is a storytelling way of learning about software testing for readers of any age.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566905277/lo2fhx1igcepcudkcqjp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I have chosen the theme of dragons and knights for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, I’ve been a big fan of fantasy literature from a young age, starting from Tolkien. I have been involved in roleplaying for the past twenty years. My passion for fantasy extends to writing, too. Authoring fantasy is one of my dreams.  Secondly, I do believe <strong>the fantasy theme appeals to youth </strong>today, probably even more than in years past. There has been an on-march of medieval fantasy, including dragons, in books, movies, toys and so on. This trend seems to be continuing. Thirdly, I have a wonderful son, who is a big fan of dragons. This is also for him!</p>
<p>I am planning for a book of 6,7 inches x 9,6 inches. This is subject to design matters of course. <strong>The book’s current draft comes up to 120-130 pages. If I get enough funding through here, the book will be published in hardcover</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Why learn about software testing?</strong></h3>
<p>The world is full of software. It is hard to live a day without using software in some form or another. Some software works on its own (like games), some enable services (like online banks) and some are a crucial part of physical products (like cars or planes). <strong>The more critical or complex the software is the better quality it has to be</strong>. Companies need great software to differentiate from the competition. <strong>Software testing is the key approach to creating this great quality.</strong></p>
<p>The lack of software developers, or coders, is in the news all the time. <strong>You have your coding schools, and other such initiatives to get children into coding at a young age.</strong> Which is very good, of course, also from the testing point of view. All coding includes some testing. What software testing professionals always notice, however, is that software testing is more than the testing done by the developer. Even a developer that knows her testing still makes mistakes, creating defects. And there are so many types of defects from performance problems to functionality failures. Usually, the developer doesn’t have time for enough testing to find these defects. This is human but underlines the need of larger focus on software testing skills. <strong>There is a lack of testers, too. Everyone should have testing skills at basic level. </strong> Some will specialize in software testing and become testing professionals, to become really skilled in finding defects. Software testing accounts to about one-third of all software development time and money, depending on what you include in that sum.</p>
<p><strong>The world deserves better software and that requires a good understanding of software testing.</strong> <strong>In general, we need more software testing awareness and skills. We also do need to bring software testing into the attention of children,</strong> who are interested in code. If they get into coding, their better understanding of testing will help them to be better developers. They also might become software testers, adding into the honorable profession of software testers.</p>
<p>For some children, and adults, too, the software testing may be their best, most viable way into the fascinating world of information technology. Not all people have the talent or interest to be great developers, but they can still be very meaningful in the world of IT. Software testing offers also such possibilities. <strong>As the testing, agile and DevOps philosophies say, testing is everywhere and done by everybody.</strong> Thus customers, users, technical staff, developers, and yes, professional testers need to have solid software testing skills. It all starts with awareness and understanding of software testing.</p>

<h3><strong>The budget</strong></h3>
<p>I have written the first draft of the book in Finnish during a sabbatical year from work, and I can take the time to translate it in English, too. But, I do need funds to get the book to be all I’ve imagined, especially concerning the illustration. I can afford the basic illustrations that bring the characters (dragons, people) alive, but I believe the book will be so much better with illustrations throughout the storyline. Obviously, also technical tasks like page design, editing, professional proofreading and printing the book cost money.  <strong>So your money will be used</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to bring <strong>illustrations</strong> in the book from minimum viable product level to higher level</p></li>
<li>to pay for professional <strong>design</strong>
</li>
<li>to pay for professional <strong>proofreading</strong>
</li>
<li>to pay for a professional <strong>editor</strong>
</li>
<li>to <strong>publish </strong>the book in print with 3000 copies in English and 3000 copies in Finnish</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risk mitigation</strong></h3>
<p>If I don’t get enough funds through Indiegogo, I’ll publish the book with priority one illustrations only, which I’ll fund from my own pocket. For the printing and publishing part, I would need to rely more on a publisher, possibly settle with softcover book only. I have the contacts already, though, not to worry.</p>
<p>As I work for my employer Knowit most of the time, there is a risk of book project being delayed. I'm mitigating the risk by taking some time off from work. In worst case, the book will be published some months later than the estimated release time. </p>
<p><strong>In any case, the book will be published with both English and Finnish</strong>. It will be a great book. But, with your help, it can be a fantastic book! I have a track record of finishing anything I decide to do. This book will happen, too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>How can I help?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Back my campaign, so buy my books!</strong> There are also additional, interesting stuff in the perks, including presentation sets for schools to learn about software testing, live webinars, personal chats over Skype, dragon posters.</p>
<p>Also,<strong> remember to tell everyone about this campaign</strong>. Use the Indiegogo sharing tools or your own social media and other channels. Tell your kids and their school teachers about this campaign and this book.</p>
<p><strong>By backing and sharing this campaign you also contribute to the greater good</strong>. You’ll help educate the new generations in our world about software testing. This will result in better software, services of better quality, better functioning society. Better world. This is why I do this. You should, too!</p>

I need your help in publishing an excellent software testing book in English AND in Finnish for kids and adults. It will be both a fantasy book with dragons and knights AND an introductory book about software testing. The main target group is kids of 10-15 years old, but the book is suitable for ages of 10-99, so adults, too! Age of ten is the traditional age to start reading fantasy books, Also at that age, technology becomes interesting. This book will extend that interest to software testing. I believe the best way to do it is to tell stories that are interesting on their own – the book “Dragons Out!”. 
The book is almost ready in Finnish and just needs illustration and translation to English.
My name is Mr. Kari Kakkonen and I’ve been working in the software testing industry for over twenty years. All that time I’ve also spent a considerable part of my free time to voluntary, non-profit activities around software testing, currently elected as the Secretary of ISTQB, globally. I’ve written numerous blogs and co-authored Agile Testing Foundations book. This new book is my effort to reach towards children with the software testing topic.
Let’s teach software testing to the new generations, to contribute to better software and better quality of life in our world. So buy the book and share this campaign to everyone!


The book
At the time of the writing of this, I have finished the first draft of the book in Finnish. I will write an English version immediately after. I have found an amazing illustrator, Adrienn Széll, to draw fantastic pictures to bring the book alive. Next tasks include finding a designer, editor, and publisher.
The book tells a growth story of two 10-year old children, Laura and Tom, from kids into knight apprentices. They learn about dragons and knights fighting those dragons, and get into real action themselves, too. They get help from male and female knights and a wise old sage. The stories take place in a setting resembling medieval Europe. As these fantasy stories unfold, I explain to the readers the software development and testing world in analogies or parallels.

Each chapter introduces another type of dragon, which represents a software defect/bug in the real world. Knights represent software testers and developers. Villagers and the two children represent software users. And so on. Everything is an analogy. Obviously, the knights and villagers want the dragons out of their towns and villages, hence also the name of the book “Dragons Out!”.
Here is a sample of dragon story in the book draft translated into English:
At night, Sebastian woke the children and they walked to the guard post. Sky was full of bright stars, but otherwise the only light came from Sebastian’s torch. Cypress scent was in the air. For a long time you couldn’t hear anything but rustle of the wind in the trees and crickets chirping. Suddenly Laura startled, when Sebastian shook her shoulder. There were flames a few houses away. They walked carefully closer. One wall of the house was about to collapse. Flames were getting stronger. They saw a dark shape hovering in front of the fire. It had black wings and tall winding tail. Now it breathed fire towards another part of the wall, which burst into flames. It was a dragon!
And here's a sample of testing explanation in the book draft translated into English:
In the story, the team of knights found and killed the dragon. In real life, the software development team together (developers and testers) was able to find, locate and fix the defect. They shared tasks in a way that everyone helped each other using their special skills. In the story, Knight Swanlake was talented in finding dragons. In real world, she was better in testing than the rest of her team members, which was why at this time she found the defect.

Why learn about software testing?
The world is full of software. It is hard to live a day without using software in some form or another.

The more critical or complex the software is the better quality it has to be. Companies need great software to differentiate from the competition.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Russ Burlingame, and I'm an entertainment journalist. I currently work for a major geek-news site and have worked in and around that space consistently since 1999. For the last six months, I've been conducting dozens of interviews with cast, crew, and fans of the 2001 movie <i>Josie and the Pussycats.</i></p>
<p>The film, which was a box office bomb when it was released, has become a cult classic in the intervening years, and to celebrate its 20th anniversary in April, I wanted to write an (unofficial) oral history -- one which incorporates some of the well-worn stories of the film's production as well as new information, some folks who I don't believe have ever been interviewed about their ties to the film, and more.</p>
<p><i>Josie and the Pussycats </i>isn't the kind of film that generally gets a book written about it, but like the wonderful (but unrelated) <i>Josie and the Podcats</i> podcast from 2020, the aim here is to inform the reader while celebrating this movie and the people who contributed to its cult classic status.</p>
<p>The movie is an underrated gem, and I love it. More than that, though, exploring how a movie failed at the box office but went on to find its audience years and decades later is a fascinating narrative in itself. There's a whole segment of the book that talks with fans -- both the famous and the everyday -- about why they love this movie, and how they helped it remain beloved long after more successful films of the same era have lost their luster.</p>
<p>I love this project. I would do it if for free. But if I did, it would do a disservice to the people who have helped me put it together (and those who have committed to do so, since I still have a handful of interviews ahead of me as of this writing). Putting together a fan page, or even a series of interviews at the site where I work, would be ephemeral. Much of my early journalistic writing is now lost to the sands of time after sites have gone out of business or just revamped their websites to get rid of the old and usher in the new. To write a definitive and meaningful exploration of this film, its production, reception, and legacy, I wanted to do more.</p>
<p>That, of course, is where crowdfunding comes in. To do the book in the way I wanted, and to have it completed in 2021, I decided early on that I would crowdfund some elements of the project in order to bring it from theory to reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The crowdfunding campaign is to pay for a few very specific things: Transcription services (so that the hundred-plus hours of interviews I've conducted for <i>Best Movie Ever</i> can be turned around quickly and professionally), the conferencing and recording services I have used to conduct many of the interviews, and the actual cost of formatting the ebooks and publishing the physical books so that people can read it. I will also be paying fees to an editor and to an assistant who has helped set up a number of the interviews and continues to pursue those who have yet to commit.</p>
<p>The importance of getting it professionally transcribed and edited is twofold: people get paid, and in the case of transcription, you get a human touch that is more accurate than any AI can manage.</p>
<p>To get people excited to help me make the book a reality, I have plenty of cool perks to offer, including not just the physical books, but in some cases custom editions of the book, hand-bound and with unique cover art and introductions. At some levels, fans can also get actual props from the movies (I have some and have a number of others being shipped to me), art prints, and more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book is GOING to happen. I am going with IndieGoGo because if there is a budgetary shortfall here, I will personally finance the remainder (so, a site like Kickstarter would be a mess because it's all-or-nothing funding). I have run the numbers so that what you fund, you will be able to get. Reaching my funding goal just means the book will come sooner, slicker, and that I will be able to finance a larger print run, so that copies of the book can be available to those who don't order here.</p>
<p>But don't let that lull you into a false sense of security, because that last part is important. The crowdfunding campaign is key to helping me gauge interest in the book, so hitting our goals will not only make the process faster and easier, but it will encourage me to print additional copies. Since this book is a print-on-demand product, the more committed backers are, the larger the print run we can make happen. In short, if you want a physical copy of the book, this is where to get it. If enough people put it off for later, and the campaign comes up short, there will be no margin for error and only those who have pre-ordered the book through the campaign will be able to get a printed copy of <i>Best Movie Ever</i>.</p>
<p><i>Josie and the Pussycats</i> was a movie that put star Rachael Leigh Cook in ""movie jail,"" and which directors Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan have joked has ""at least thirty"" fans. It was a box office failure that was foreseen early enough that Elfont and Kaplan couldn't even really enjoy their own premiere, with the pall of a flop hanging over them. Years later, it's a different story -- and that's the one I'm telling.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always the risk that something catastrophic happens, and I cannot fulfill my obligation. As a human being, I have to acknowledge that. Maybe I get fired from my day job and can't afford to finance the difference between what's funded here and what isn't. Maybe I die and the book goes unfinished.</p>
<p>Those are...basically the only things I can think of. It is possible, obviously. But the interviews are mostly done, the book is well underway, I have picked out an assistant and a printer, and done all the math. I already have physical possession of a number of movie props, set blueprints, and other one-of-a-kind items I can provide to backers as add-on perks with a pre-order of the book (sorry, we don't have enough of them lying around to make that a separate item).</p>
<p>The real challenges now are completion and distribution, which are the two things that the crowdfunding hopes to achieve.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I get that some people cannot back a project like this. It certainly isn't a basic human need, and the global pandemic has put a lot of people's spending habits on hold. If you can't contribute to the campaign, here's what you can do:</p>
<p>Get out there on social media! Use the hashtag #JosieBook, and link back to the campaign. You can follow me (@russburlingame) on Twitter for updates, and retweet those to help others spot the campaign, too.

<p><strong>Meditations on Black Paper</strong></p>
<p>Publishing the written word has changed significantly over the last two millennia. From papyrus scrolls and ornate manuscripts to printed pamphlets and the modern bound novel, how we convey our thoughts to the world has always been in constant flux.</p>
<p>Indeed, books, printing and publishing have often defined history, with each change ushering in a change in how society thinks, communicates, and acts.</p>
<p>But throughout history, one thing about published works has remained the same: the presentation of black or dark text on a white background.</p>
<p>This is about to change.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623218307/ogvxh2fxnhoynzdns2rp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Notice how the white text stands out against a black background</i></p>
<p><strong>Why Black Paper?</strong></p>
<p>Black text on a white background can be tough on the eyes. If you’ve ever spent a day in front of a computer screen, reading or writing large amounts of text, you’ll recognize the feeling. Tired eyes, headaches, and a lack of focus. Scanning text against the glare of a white background makes your eyes and brain work harder, leaving you feeling exhausted and unable to concentrate after sustained periods.</p>
<p>This isn’t limited to electronic devices, either. Long stretches of reading novels, magazines, or journals can have the same effect.</p>
<p>Many have switched their electronic devices to Dark Mode. They quickly notice that not only is it less tiring on the eyes, it also makes the text itself far easier to read. Light text against a dark background really leaps off the page.</p>

<p><i>A notebook that was used during the planning of this project</i></p>
<p>When we launched the pre-campaign to verify if there might be some interest in books printed on black paper, we started receiving messages not only commenting on the aesthetical side of the book, but also explaining that for many reading a black coloured text on white paper was very difficult for them, due to dyslexia, eye floaters, neurological problems, etc, and how happy they were that Meditations on Black Paper might help them to enjoy reading.</p>
<p>“This is great. I’m dyslexic and like to read, this is one of two formats I can read in. Black with white print.""</p>
<p>We chose Meditations by Marcus Aurelius to start with because it is such a relevant and influential book, but our plans are broader. If the funding for Meditations on Black Paper is successful, then other titles in the same format will follow! </p>
<p>The start-up that we are launching, Monochrome Books, will be dedicated to printing the most relevant books on black paper.</p>
<p>Kickstarter is the perfect place to launch this project: if the community is interested in this project then Meditations on Black Paper will be printed.</p>

<p><i>An early test to evaluate the viability of printing on black paper</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reinventing the pleasure of reading</strong></p>
<p>Books have always strived to be beautiful objects as well as communicative tools. From the illuminated manuscripts of medieval monks, to the gilded-edge leather-bound tomes of the 19th and 20th centuries, books are pieces of art in their own right.</p>
<p>Black paper printing is the latest example of beauty and aesthetics in the history of the written word.</p>

<p><i>A page from Meditations on Black Paper</i></p>
<p>Black paper printing offers a unique experience for the reader. Books printed on black paper are visually stunning, creating a remarkable, eye-catching effect that stands out from the page. Black paper printing allows books to be more than just functional items, but rather unique pieces of design as well. Something beautiful and practical - a wonderful combination of form and function that elevates the written word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Meditations</strong></p>
<p>A pioneering edition of a beloved classic.</p>
<p>Meditations by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius will be published entirely on Italian black paper.</p>
<p>This extraordinary collection of writings is the perfect starting point for this new publishing venture.</p>
<p>Created between 161 and 180 AD, Meditations is widely considered to be one of the most influential books ever written. A collection of the personal writings of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Meditations sets out the Stoic precepts and philosophies that guided his life and offers a unique insight into the mind of one of the great historical figures of Classical antiquity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623218884/mpkpmfjv2ulqjjveogvh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, author of Meditations</i></p>
<p>Although it has become one of the most important examples of Stoic philosophy, it is likely that Meditations was never meant to be published. The collection was written as a personal journal for guidance and reflection, a way for Marcus Aurelius to marshal his own thoughts while on military campaigns, and does not even have a formal title.</p>
<p>As you might expect from the writings of a military man, and an emperor no less, Meditations is not simply a theoretical work of philosophy. It analyzes reality from the perspective of Marcus Aurelius himself, showing how people are both players and authors of their own reality. We may not have the power to choose the events that occur in our life, but we do have the power to react to them as we see fit. This is one of the guiding principles of Stoicism and a key part of the book’s resonance throughout history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stoicism</strong></p>
<p>Stoicism is an Ancient Greek ethical philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the 3rd century BC. It is one of the most accessible and relevant philosophies, directly applicable to the real world, and has been hugely influential throughout history.</p>
<p>Stoicism teaches acceptances of the moments and the things that happen to us, and how not to be driven or controlled by desire or fear. It can help us be more resilient, happier, and more virtuous, and has influenced great figures throughout history, from Frederick the Great to George Washington.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623218499/h3ppav8ueqmegqqjkqsm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>The city of Athens, the birthplace of Stoicism</i></p>
<p>Stoicism is based around four virtues; courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom. People are judged by Stoicism not by what they say, but by what they do, and by following the Stoic principles it becomes a far easier task to overcome life’s challenges.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Books</strong></p>
<p>All of our limited edition books will be fully printed on Italian black paper using only white ink (the paper that we will use is FSC certified from sustainable forests).</p>
<p>Printed and bound using centuries-old techniques, traditions, and technologies, each special edition will represent a piece of history. These processes are longer, harder, and more expensive than ordinary printing, but the final result is something extraordinarily beautiful.</p>
<p>Meditations on Black Paper will be approximately 180 pages long and in an A5 size format.</p>
<p>We will create three distinctive editions: a hardcover edition, a cloth and leather hand bounded edition and a full leather hand bounded edition.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>We want to clarify that Meditations on Black Paper will not be reverse printed!</p>
<p>In reverse printing, a white page is printed all over with black ink except for the text which remains the colour of the page. This process uses an excessive amount of ink and the result is mediocre at best.</p>
<p>We will print directly on black paper that is produced with this colour using black pigments. The printing process is much more difficult and also much more expensive, but the end results are truly worth it!</p>

<p><strong>Partnering up with Tree-Nation</strong></p>
<p>For every book that we sell, we will plant a tree!</p>
<p>Following the project completion, the trees will be planted with the collaboration of Tree-Nation. Each of our supporters will first receive a confirmation email from us with details on your order. A little later you will receive a separate email from Tree-Nation with the title 'Monochrome Books offered you a tree on Tree-Nation’, where you can find all the information regarding the real tree: the specific details, its location and a link to the tree certificate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>
<p>The funding goal of 6.200 Euros is the amount that we need to conduct a minimal printing series. Below this level, Meditations on Black Paper will be too expensive to print. If our backers can help us surpass this goal, then we can try to unlock stretch goals that will benefit all backers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>! Unlocked - 10.000 Euros - Better Cover Material</p>
<p>The hardcover is originally planned in Wilabin paper. However, if we can surpass the mark of 10.000 Euros, we will use a better quality cover.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>! Unlocked - 20.000 Euros  - Better Quality Paper</p>
<p>We plan to use 115gr sirio black paper, made in Italy. If we achieve 20.000 Euros in pledges we will be able to use heavier paper on the edition of Meditations.</p>
<p> </p>

The collection was written as a personal journal for guidance and reflection, a way for Marcus Aurelius to marshal his own thoughts while on military campaigns, and does not even have a formal title.
As you might expect from the writings of a military man, and an emperor no less, Meditations is not simply a theoretical work of philosophy. It analyzes reality from the perspective of Marcus Aurelius himself, showing how people are both players and authors of their own reality. We may not have the power to choose the events that occur in our life, but we do have the power to react to them as we see fit. This is one of the guiding principles of Stoicism and a key part of the book’s resonance throughout history.
 
Stoicism
Stoicism is an Ancient Greek ethical philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the 3rd century BC. It is one of the most accessible and relevant philosophies, directly applicable to the real world, and has been hugely influential throughout history.
Stoicism teaches acceptances of the moments and the things that happen to us, and how not to be driven or controlled by desire or fear. It can help us be more resilient, happier, and more virtuous, and has influenced great figures throughout history, from Frederick the Great to George Washington.

The city of Athens, the birthplace of Stoicism
Stoicism is based around four virtues; courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom. People are judged by Stoicism not by what they say, but by what they do, and by following the Stoic principles it becomes a far easier task to overcome life’s challenges.
 
The Books
All of our limited edition books will be fully printed on Italian black paper using only white ink (the paper that we will use is FSC certified from sustainable forests).
Printed and bound using centuries-old techniques, traditions, and technologies, each special edition will represent a piece of history. These processes are longer, harder, and more expensive than ordinary printing, but the final result is something extraordinarily beautiful.
Meditations on Black Paper will be approximately 180 pages long and in an A5 size format.
We will create three distinctive editions: a hardcover edition, a cloth and leather hand bounded edition and a full leather hand bounded edition.

The prototype for Meditations on Black Paper
Hardcover Edition
This Edition will be limited to twice the number of books subscribed on Kickstarter
· Printed in Belgium on the finest Italian black paper.
· Hardcover in Wilabin noir paper.
· Signed with a thank you note for helping bring this project to completion.
· Numbered in the limited edition.

The Forum Edition and the Augustus Edition will be hand bounded using only traditional tools and methods
Forum Edition
Hand bound in Cloth and Leather
Limited to 150 copies
· Printed in Belgium on finest Italian black paper.
· Hand bound in cloth and leather in a stunning design by Arte no Livro studio, a Portuguese atelier specialized in fine binding and books restoration.
· Housed in a handmade museum quality solander case manufactured by Klug Conservation, a German company specializing in the conservation of antique books and documents.
· Signed with a thank you note for helping bring this project to completion.
· Numbered in the limited edition.
Augustus Edition
Hand bound in Leather
Limited to 60
· Printed in Belgium on finest Italian black paper
· Hand bound in leather in a stunning design by Arte no Livro studio, a Portuguese atelier specialized in fine binding and books restoration
· Housed in a handmade museum quality solander case manufactured by Klug Conservation, a German company specializing in the conservation of antique books and documents
· Signed with a thank you note for helping bring this project to completion.
· Numbered in the limited edition.
 
Environmental Responsibilities
We want to clarify that Meditations on Black Paper will not be reverse printed!
In reverse printing, a white page is printed all over with black ink except for the text which remains the colour of the page. This process uses an excessive amount of ink and the result is mediocre at best.
We will print directly on black paper that is produced with this colour using black pigments. The printing process is much more difficult and also much more expensive, but the end results are truly worth it!

Partnering up with Tree-Nation
For every book that we sell, we will plant a tree!
Following the project completion, the trees will be planted with the collaboration of Tree-Nation. Each of our supporters will first receive a confirmation email from us with details on your order. A little later you will receive a separate email from Tree-Nation with the title 'Monochrome Books offered you a tree on Tree-Nation’, where you can find all the information regarding the real tree: the specific details, its location and a link to the tree certificate.
 
Stretch Goals
The funding goal of 6.200 Euros is the amount that we need to conduct a minimal printing series. Below this level, Meditations on Black Paper will be too expensive to print. If our backers can help us surpass this goal, then we can try to unlock stretch goals that will benefit all backers.
 
! Unlocked - 10.000 Euros - Better Cover Material
The hardcover is originally planned in Wilabin paper. However, if we can surpass the mark of 10.000 Euros, we will use a better quality cover.
 
! Unlocked - 20.000 Euros  - Better Quality Paper
We plan to use 115gr sirio black paper, made in Italy. If we achieve 20.000 Euros in pledges we will be able to use heavier paper on the edition of Meditations.
 
! Unlocked - 30.000 Euros  - Slipcase
If our supporters pledge above 30.000 Euros, we will design a custom made slipcase to house your copy of Meditations on Black Paper.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a published author and editor who writes and teaches in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.  My 2010 collection of poetry, <i>This hot place</i>, was shortlisted for the Saskatchewan First Book Award.  An excerpt of an unpublished children's novel received a 2012 Short Manuscript Award from the Saskatchewan Writers Guild.  A second manuscript of poetry is looking for a home.  I have received small financial awards from the Saskatchewan Arts Board and the Canada Council for the Arts in the past. But this time I'm calling on friends and other patrons of the arts for their direct support.</p>
<p>This project came quickly, almost a surprise. I'd thought I'd be writing travel article about Japan.  But after a workshop with Saskatchewan writer, Brenda Schmidt, on the use of photographs to craft poems, I wrote several short nonfiction pieces.  A few months later, in a Dennis Cooley workshop on poetry as babble and doodle I shared a new poem with the class and realized that UNCLEAR FUTURE was underway.  That same day, a reminder email about the Vancouver Manuscript Intensive inspired me to apply.  I was accepted into the program and have Vancouver Poet Laureate, Rachel Rose, as a mentor to guide me through to completion of a solid first draft. </p>
<p>Months earlier, almost on a whim, I'd booked a return trip to Japan. I'd found an unbelievably good price on a seat sale.  Months before that, I knew I'd return to Japan and told a group of expats that when I said goodbye to them in Kyoto.  I will revisit Hiroshima and Kyoto, as well as my daughter in Nagoya.  But, because I changed flights to avoid flying through a certain country, I have an additional five days and a penalty to pay on the changed flight. </p>
<p>I think the manuscript may benefit from a visit to Nagasaki as well.</p>

Toward the end of his life, Stauffacher expressed that these prints were “experimental up to a point”: a series of investigations that, once complete, yielded a deliberate statement of design. Today, they are in the permanent collections of many major museums.  ma5 series prints, Jack Stauffacher, 1969. Collection of Letterform Archive. Edited and designed by Chuck Byrne (a years-long contributor to PRINT magazine and Stauffacher’s longtime friend and representative in the art world), Only on Saturday:
will be the first widely distributed book on AIGA medalist Jack Stauffacher; 
features hundreds of his wood type prints — many of which have never before been shared in book form — all imaged and printed using the highest reproduction standards in a handsome, large-format art book;
provides an unprecedented look at Stauffacher’s process, presented through in-progress materials recovered from his studio;
thoroughly documents Stauffacher’s influences, from his early days in the California letterpress scene to his absorption of modernist and Swiss Style teachings;
includes insights from established names in type like Chuck Bigelow, Matthew Carter, and Jim Faris; representatives of the modern art world such as Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher, SFMOMA curator, and Staci Steinberger, LACMA associate curator; and a host of his closest friends and collaborators, including photographer Dennis Letbetter.

While we have already invested heavily in the book’s development, your support will cover production costs and enable Letterform Archive to digitize our complete collection of Stauffacher prints, freezing their details — their color, type impression, and paper texture — in high-resolution reproductions that will be enjoyed for generations.  The regular (left) and deluxe (right) editions of Only on Saturday.THE BOOKA Choice of Two Editions Only on Saturday is available in two editions: regular, a hardcover design featuring one of Stauffacher’s experimental press sheets and a jacket artfully wrapped with a full-bleed image from his book At Hand . . .  The regular edition, with its jacket unfolded. ... and deluxe, a hardcover plus a portfolio containing 10 offset facsimile prints and 10 letterpress proofs created with Stauffacher’s actual wood type. The book and portfolio are housed in a slipcase, and all three are covered in Stauffacher’s favorite raw silk.  The deluxe edition, with its slipcase and portfolio of letterpress wood type proofs and offset facsimile prints. Created at the Berkeley print shop of esteemed printer and Stauffacher’s friend Peter Koch, the portfolio’s 10 letterpress wood type proofs offer fans the unique chance to own impressions made using his actual wood type — with all of their formal magic and special surface imperfections clearly visible on the page. The portfolio of the deluxe edition of Only on Saturday, with the letterpress wood type proofs on the left and offset facsimile prints on the right. The Story Only on Saturday examines five limited-edition portfolios of Stauffacher’s prints, as well as his individual monoprints and series prints. For each major body of work, a selection of images is paired with a first-person essay from one of Stauffacher’s collaborators, who together paint a portrait of a printer-scholar at the top of his craft. Only on Saturday also features an in-depth essay by Chuck Byrne that traces the printer’s influences and artistic development. Byrne takes us from Stauffacher’s first encounters with California letterpress printers, to his introduction to the modernist principles of Piet Mondrian and László Moholy-Nagy, to his time in Basel with famed Swiss designers Jan Tschichold and Emil Ruder, whose deliberations about typography helped Stauffacher see the page as a space fit for experimental typographic meditations. The Contributors Kristina Bell · John D.

He also traveled to Italy on a Fulbright scholarship to learn from European master printers, taught typography at Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon) and the San Francisco Art Institute, and served as typographic director at Stanford University Press. Undeterred by new technologies, Stauffacher also advised Adobe as they undertook reviving classic typefaces for digital use in the 1980s.  Stauffacher in his office at Carnegie Tech, circa 1960.

First, is the band’s incredible longevity. The Sons have been playing together, notwithstanding various personnel changes, and several hiatuses, for more than 50 years, an amazing feat any way you cut it. Equally impressive is that over this time they never reverted to anything resembling a “greatest hits” or tribute band, and have continued moving forward with new arrangements, innovations and material all the way through. </p><p>Next, of near or equal interest to many of the group’s loyal fans is discovering a reasonable explanation to the puzzling question of why, in light of their consistently top level artistic talent, The Sons never achieved greater commercial success. Both of these questions require complex explanations, and are central to the documentation of the band’s story in this biography.</p><p>And finally, from a historical standpoint especially, one of the more interesting facets of The Sons’ long and curious career is the fact that it spanned two significant periods in the developmental history of rock and roll music. Coming of age in rock's still parochial formative years, the early Sons of Champlin were among the multitudes of bands hoping to land gigs for what were then considered sizable crowds of perhaps 200 fans. For them and so many other like minded young rock musicians forming groups during the early 1960s, among the many changes witnessed during the ensuing decade was the monumental increase, both literally and figuratively, in the level of opportunities to play and be heard. In many ways it was a perfect confluence of the country’s growing economy, (including what would become huge opportunities for the entertainment business), and the enormous social and political challenges that were becoming focal points for a youth generation of unprecedented numbers. As the decade continued to unfold, many of these youngsters were becoming increasingly convinced that this country, indeed the world, could be a better place if everyone were to take stock and work together for much needed and necessary change.</p><p>Rock music’s increasing level of thematic emphasis on personal liberation and consciousness raising was directly addressing this growing sense of possibility for the future. Its expressive power and energy, indeed its musicality, thrust the music into a central unifying role in the emerging perspective, both reflecting and fueling a world view that was capturing the imagination and optimism of a generation. And the Sons of Champlin were right there in the middle of it, sounding a call that helped to propel this music into something more far reaching and influential than anyone then could ever have imagined.</p><p>Can you feel it coming?<br/>It’s gonna set you back on your heels.<br/>It’s gonna sound like humming<br/>And you’ll believe in how good it feels.</p><p>1982-A, <i>Loosen Up Naturally</i> (1969)<br/>--The Sons of Champlin</p><p>Among the established bands and performers coming out of Marin County in the late 1950s and early 60s were the trailblazing Kustom Keys, legendary Marin rock and roll pioneer, John Allair, the Swingin’ Deacons with John Cippolina (later of Quicksilver Messenger Service), the Chord Lords, and the precursor to the Sons of Champlin, the Opposite Six, featuring Bill Champlin, Tim Cain, Rob Moitoza and ultimately Terry Haggerty. All of these groups were laying the foundation for the region’s reputation as a center for top notch talent. And at the same time by booking, in particular, the younger of these fledgling bands to play in local school auditoriums and recreational centers, a growing contingent of vibrant entrepreneurial newcomers, including the likes of Marin teenager Ed Margoliash, were actively gaming for the fertile profit making potential of baby-boomer fans clamoring to hear the music they loved. And just across the Golden Gate Bridge was the remarkably industrious Bill Graham, who would become central to the development of San Francisco's music scene and forever alter how rock music was promoted and marketed to American youth.</p><p>On another front, unprecedented economic prosperity following WWII portended a dramatic increase in the amount of discretionary money available to the period’s youth, particularly those of the white middle class, and became a driving force behind the sharp increase in not only the interest in the music by the recording industry, but also the corresponding rise in radio stations gearing up to satisfy the appetites of those searching for access to rock and roll. And ultimately, with the emergence of the youth counterculture, particularly in mid-1960s San Francisco, pioneering music promoters such as Chet Helms and the enterprising Graham began revolutionizing local concert productions to accommodate not only the growing number of quality bands but the legions of fans wanting to see them perform. Arriving in San Francisco early in the decade and searching for inroads into the artistic landscape, both Graham and Helms by 1966 had opened the doors to such historic venues as the Fillmore Auditorium, Winterland and the Avalon Ballroom, sites that would establish the gold standard for rock concerts everywhere during the period. And from the very start, a core mainstay on the rosters of musicians hired to play these hallowed halls were The Sons of Champlin. </p><p>In many ways, it is this status that reflects the importance and relevance of The Sons to the Bay Area music scene of the 60s and 70s. They were always in the mix, always in the game, and consistently produced the kind of quality music that earned the deep respect of not only their fan base but of their musical peers across the board. This is a fact. And as such, it can be argued that The Sons are a perfect lens through which to view the musical and cultural developments of the period.  </p><p>Going into this project, it was understood that this band’s history was a complex and complicated one, as most powerful artistic collaborations are. I can remember early in the going, Champlin telling me that depending on which side of the stage you were on, the experience could be a very different one. Engaging in the long series of interviews and conversations with band members and others in the mix has borne this out. And although there was initial reticence on the part of some members of the group, especially when asked to weigh in on more personal matters, we soon established the level of personal trust between writer and subject that authentic and reliable documentations require.</p><p>As with all good histories, this biography is more than simply an overview of the music. It is also a profile of the diverse and unique personalities and talents involved, all framed within the context of what was happening musically and culturally in the times and places where it all transpired. In doing the necessary research and interview work to this point, I am more convinced than ever that bringing this history to life is very much worth the effort and that everyone involved, from band members to the fan base, will be pleased and gratified with the end product. </p><p><strong><u>The Story Behind The Story</u></strong></p><p>My name is Joe Mathews and I was born in San Francisco in 1952. I grew up on the mid-peninsula, graduated in 1970 from Woodside High School in Redwood City, and after completing a BS and MA in 1975, became a high school history teacher, spending much of my professional life in public education. Since 1995 I have been writing biographical oral history, including a collection underwritten by the National Endowment for the Humanities titled, <i>California Rhythm and Blues Music: 1945-1955</i>, portions of which are archived in the Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley and the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. Since that time I have published additional biographical histories as well as work for a variety of journals and periodicals.</p><p>As a youngster, music was an integral part of life around our family home. With my dad being a pretty serious music buff, we always had a reliable stream of tunes pouring out of the hi-fi, priming all of us kids on the swing era bands and jazz greats from the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. But for me, the watershed year was 1957, when at age 5, I first heard Little Richard’s, “Keep a Knockin”, from which point onward I became forever captivated by the sounds of the great rock and roll, soul, and R&amp;B masters of the day. Access to it all was flowing from local Bay Area Top 40 AM radio stations that began broadcasting in the late 1950s, including San Francisco stalwarts KEWB, KYA and KFRC, San Jose’s KLIV, and Oakland’s soul music flagship, the “Lucky 13”, KDIA. From then on, my ears were wide open to everything coming over the airwaves, including from the old clock radio anchored at the head of my bed that found me regularly tuning in until way past when it was assumed the lights were out for the night.  And so began the steady diet that was going to fuel my musical interests for decades to come. I just couldn’t get enough of it. To this day, I can easily recall the ten-year-old boy eagerly laying out his hard saved $12 for the shiny new transistor radio in the local drug store’s display case, enabling me to travel with the music at all times. </p><p>As I grew into a dedicated fan of the likes of soul greats James Brown, and the monster performers from Stax and Motown, I fell in love with the integrated power of the back beat and the groove, the dynamic arranging, sweet horn sections, and the knock-out singing that was coming from the wide array of these mostly black artists of the day. Like so many of you that were similarly taken by their energy and dynamism, these tunes served as a daily source of vitality and inspiration for me, made even more powerful against the backdrop of the rapidly changing racial awareness sweeping across the country at the time. </p><p>By no means any less captivating in its own right, was the tidal wave of great music coming from so many other groups and performers around the country, not to mention the surge from across the Atlantic once the British Invasion kicked in. Listening to my trusty radio as I waited for the school bus, I can distinctly remember hearing the Beatles’ “I Want To Hold Your Hand” for the first time and thinking, “Wow, what good song. Who are these guys?” Same thing upon first hearing the Stones’ cover of “Not Fade Away”, whose interpretations of the blues from a continent away were ironically introducing this bedrock American art form to a whole new generation of young kids in this country, me included. It was a fabulously unrelenting current of talent and new songs that were being aired by radio station DJ’s every single week. Scores of new bands were cranking out so many memorable tunes (check out the 1964 TAMI show event filmed live from the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium for a quick reminder of the amazing artistic array that was routinely available over the airwaves).</p><p>And right here in the Bay Area was something else, right? In addition to regional musical pillars such as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother, Cold Blood, Quicksilver, Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, and more, an abundance of sounds were proliferating from a host of other local bands such as  The Count V, Sydicate of Sound, Beau Brummels, and The Seeds. The excitement surrounding the new music and records was everywhere and simply impossible to ignore, and it seemed as though new listening revelations were always just around the corner. Any chance you remember putting The Electric Flag’s “Long Time Comin'"" on the turntable and hearing “Killing Floor” for the first time? Man, it felt as if nothing better in the universe could possibly be rolling through life at that point. Add to that the advent of FM radio’s trailblazing KMPX and KSAN, the slates of live shows happening every weekend at San Francisco’s storied venues and so many others around the Bay, and you’ve got a music culture that was steamrolling into something positively magical. To this day when I look back on those times, I have to marvel at my good fortune of having been around for the incredible artistry and talent that was arriving on a seemingly daily basis. It was an amazing thing to behold and I am so grateful to have been a witness to it.</p><p>It was in the midst of this “best of all worlds” musical environment that I heard The Sons of Champlin’s <i>Loosen Up Naturally</i> for the first time. With its blazing R&amp;B driven power and the lightning bolt urgency of its personalized message, I was pretty much floored right off. I can remember thinking, ""Man, what a band. Where in the world did their grip on it come from?"" Well, several listenings in and that was it for me, and from that point onward, I was dialed in to whatever was coming up next. I have to say, that as a thoroughly impressionable adolescent at the time, it was not only the great playing and arrangements that got me, but the deep and incisive quality of the lyrical content that spoke to the broadening of one’s outlook on the world. So much of it pointed to the possibility of a more unrestrained,  generous, and benevolent society, where all one needed to advance the cause was to seize the optimism and engage in becoming better human beings. Great stuff. </p><p>And from there, the band continued to remain in step with popular culture, and doing what art reliably does, the Sons continued moving creatively onward with the flow, while never abandoning their definitive R&amp;B roots. They proceeded to produce six more LPs, including their 1973 masterpiece, <i>Welcome to the Dance</i>, which by all that is right in the world should have put them squarely in the center of the national rock music conversation. Based on artistic merit, both musically and lyrically, by all accounts this album was the equal to most anything in the genre coming out of the record industry at the time. Underscoring their stature by this point, Bill Graham introduced the Sons on a fall 1974 evening at Winterland by righteously proclaiming; “These gentlemen have been around as long as we have, and thank God for that. From Marin, The Sons of Champlin.” Oh, yeah.</p><p>After concluding that nothing comprehensive had ever been written on The Sons’ long and fascinating history, I decided to reach out to Bill and ask if he might  be interested in doing a documentation of this kind. He agreed to meet at his home in Los Angeles, and after an afternoon of lively conversation he decided that this was something he very much wanted to see happen. From there I reached out to the other guys, and here we are.</p><p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p><p>All the funding generated from this campaign will go directly towards underwriting the remaining travel requirements, editing, proofreading, rewards, supplies and support staff to complete the project.

First, is the band’s incredible longevity. The Sons have been playing together, notwithstanding various personnel changes, and several hiatuses, for more than 50 years, an amazing feat any way you cut it. Equally impressive is that over this time they never reverted to anything resembling a “greatest hits” or tribute band, and have continued moving forward with new arrangements, innovations and material all the way through. Next, of near or equal interest to many of the group’s loyal fans is discovering a reasonable explanation to the puzzling question of why, in light of their consistently top level artistic talent, The Sons never achieved greater commercial success. Both of these questions require complex explanations, and are central to the documentation of the band’s story in this biography.And finally, from a historical standpoint especially, one of the more interesting facets of The Sons’ long and curious career is the fact that it spanned two significant periods in the developmental history of rock and roll music. Coming of age in rock's still parochial formative years, the early Sons of Champlin were among the multitudes of bands hoping to land gigs for what were then considered sizable crowds of perhaps 200 fans. For them and so many other like minded young rock musicians forming groups during the early 1960s, among the many changes witnessed during the ensuing decade was the monumental increase, both literally and figuratively, in the level of opportunities to play and be heard. In many ways it was a perfect confluence of the country’s growing economy, (including what would become huge opportunities for the entertainment business), and the enormous social and political challenges that were becoming focal points for a youth generation of unprecedented numbers. As the decade continued to unfold, many of these youngsters were becoming increasingly convinced that this country, indeed the world, could be a better place if everyone were to take stock and work together for much needed and necessary change.Rock music’s increasing level of thematic emphasis on personal liberation and consciousness raising was directly addressing this growing sense of possibility for the future. Its expressive power and energy, indeed its musicality, thrust the music into a central unifying role in the emerging perspective, both reflecting and fueling a world view that was capturing the imagination and optimism of a generation. And the Sons of Champlin were right there in the middle of it, sounding a call that helped to propel this music into something more far reaching and influential than anyone then could ever have imagined.Can you feel it coming?It’s gonna set you back on your heels.It’s gonna sound like hummingAnd you’ll believe in how good it feels.1982-A, Loosen Up Naturally (1969)--The Sons of ChamplinAmong the established bands and performers coming out of Marin County in the late 1950s and early 60s were the trailblazing Kustom Keys, legendary Marin rock and roll pioneer, John Allair, the Swingin’ Deacons with John Cippolina (later of Quicksilver Messenger Service), the Chord Lords, and the precursor to the Sons of Champlin, the Opposite Six, featuring Bill Champlin, Tim Cain, Rob Moitoza and ultimately Terry Haggerty. All of these groups were laying the foundation for the region’s reputation as a center for top notch talent. And at the same time by booking, in particular, the younger of these fledgling bands to play in local school auditoriums and recreational centers, a growing contingent of vibrant entrepreneurial newcomers, including the likes of Marin teenager Ed Margoliash, were actively gaming for the fertile profit making potential of baby-boomer fans clamoring to hear the music they loved. And just across the Golden Gate Bridge was the remarkably industrious Bill Graham, who would become central to the development of San Francisco's music scene and forever alter how rock music was promoted and marketed to American youth.On another front, unprecedented economic prosperity following WWII portended a dramatic increase in the amount of discretionary money available to the period’s youth, particularly those of the white middle class, and became a driving force behind the sharp increase in not only the interest in the music by the recording industry, but also the corresponding rise in radio stations gearing up to satisfy the appetites of those searching for access to rock and roll. And ultimately, with the emergence of the youth counterculture, particularly in mid-1960s San Francisco, pioneering music promoters such as Chet Helms and the enterprising Graham began revolutionizing local concert productions to accommodate not only the growing number of quality bands but the legions of fans wanting to see them perform. Arriving in San Francisco early in the decade and searching for inroads into the artistic landscape, both Graham and Helms by 1966 had opened the doors to such historic venues as the Fillmore Auditorium, Winterland and the Avalon Ballroom, sites that would establish the gold standard for rock concerts everywhere during the period. And from the very start, a core mainstay on the rosters of musicians hired to play these hallowed halls were The Sons of Champlin. In many ways, it is this status that reflects the importance and relevance of The Sons to the Bay Area music scene of the 60s and 70s. They were always in the mix, always in the game, and consistently produced the kind of quality music that earned the deep respect of not only their fan base but of their musical peers across the board. This is a fact. And as such, it can be argued that The Sons are a perfect lens through which to view the musical and cultural developments of the period.  Going into this project, it was understood that this band’s history was a complex and complicated one, as most powerful artistic collaborations are. I can remember early in the going, Champlin telling me that depending on which side of the stage you were on, the experience could be a very different one. Engaging in the long series of interviews and conversations with band members and others in the mix has borne this out. And although there was initial reticence on the part of some members of the group, especially when asked to weigh in on more personal matters, we soon established the level of personal trust between writer and subject that authentic and reliable documentations require.As with all good histories, this biography is more than simply an overview of the music. It is also a profile of the diverse and unique personalities and talents involved, all framed within the context of what was happening musically and culturally in the times and places where it all transpired. In doing the necessary research and interview work to this point, I am more convinced than ever that bringing this history to life is very much worth the effort and that everyone involved, from band members to the fan base, will be pleased and gratified with the end product. The Story Behind The StoryMy name is Joe Mathews and I was born in San Francisco in 1952. I grew up on the mid-peninsula, graduated in 1970 from Woodside High School in Redwood City, and after completing a BS and MA in 1975, became a high school history teacher, spending much of my professional life in public education. Since 1995 I have been writing biographical oral history, including a collection underwritten by the National Endowment for the Humanities titled, California Rhythm and Blues Music: 1945-1955, portions of which are archived in the Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley and the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. Since that time I have published additional biographical histories as well as work for a variety of journals and periodicals.As a youngster, music was an integral part of life around our family home. With my dad being a pretty serious music buff, we always had a reliable stream of tunes pouring out of the hi-fi, priming all of us kids on the swing era bands and jazz greats from the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. But for me, the watershed year was 1957, when at age 5, I first heard Little Richard’s, “Keep a Knockin”, from which point onward I became forever captivated by the sounds of the great rock and roll, soul, and R&B masters of the day. Access to it all was flowing from local Bay Area Top 40 AM radio stations that began broadcasting in the late 1950s, including San Francisco stalwarts KEWB, KYA and KFRC, San Jose’s KLIV, and Oakland’s soul music flagship, the “Lucky 13”, KDIA. From then on, my ears were wide open to everything coming over the airwaves, including from the old clock radio anchored at the head of my bed that found me regularly tuning in until way past when it was assumed the lights were out for the night.  And so began the steady diet that was going to fuel my musical interests for decades to come. I just couldn’t get enough of it. To this day, I can easily recall the ten-year-old boy eagerly laying out his hard saved $12 for the shiny new transistor radio in the local drug store’s display case, enabling me to travel with the music at all times. As I grew into a dedicated fan of the likes of soul greats James Brown, and the monster performers from Stax and Motown, I fell in love with the integrated power of the back beat and the groove, the dynamic arranging, sweet horn sections, and the knock-out singing that was coming from the wide array of these mostly black artists of the day. Like so many of you that were similarly taken by their energy and dynamism, these tunes served as a daily source of vitality and inspiration for me, made even more powerful against the backdrop of the rapidly changing racial awareness sweeping across the country at the time. By no means any less captivating in its own right, was the tidal wave of great music coming from so many other groups and performers around the country, not to mention the surge from across the Atlantic once the British Invasion kicked in. Listening to my trusty radio as I waited for the school bus, I can distinctly remember hearing the Beatles’ “I Want To Hold Your Hand” for the first time and thinking, “Wow, what good song. Who are these guys?” Same thing upon first hearing the Stones’ cover of “Not Fade Away”, whose interpretations of the blues from a continent away were ironically introducing this bedrock American art form to a whole new generation of young kids in this country, me included. It was a fabulously unrelenting current of talent and new songs that were being aired by radio station DJ’s every single week. Scores of new bands were cranking out so many memorable tunes (check out the 1964 TAMI show event filmed live from the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium for a quick reminder of the amazing artistic array that was routinely available over the airwaves).And right here in the Bay Area was something else, right? In addition to regional musical pillars such as The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother, Cold Blood, Quicksilver, Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, and more, an abundance of sounds were proliferating from a host of other local bands such as  The Count V, Sydicate of Sound, Beau Brummels, and The Seeds. The excitement surrounding the new music and records was everywhere and simply impossible to ignore, and it seemed as though new listening revelations were always just around the corner. Any chance you remember putting The Electric Flag’s “Long Time Comin'"" on the turntable and hearing “Killing Floor” for the first time? Man, it felt as if nothing better in the universe could possibly be rolling through life at that point. Add to that the advent of FM radio’s trailblazing KMPX and KSAN, the slates of live shows happening every weekend at San Francisco’s storied venues and so many others around the Bay, and you’ve got a music culture that was steamrolling into something positively magical. To this day when I look back on those times, I have to marvel at my good fortune of having been around for the incredible artistry and talent that was arriving on a seemingly daily basis. It was an amazing thing to behold and I am so grateful to have been a witness to it.It was in the midst of this “best of all worlds” musical environment that I heard The Sons of Champlin’s Loosen Up Naturally for the first time. With its blazing R&B driven power and the lightning bolt urgency of its personalized message, I was pretty much floored right off. I can remember thinking, ""Man, what a band. Where in the world did their grip on it come from?"" Well, several listenings in and that was it for me, and from that point onward, I was dialed in to whatever was coming up next. I have to say, that as a thoroughly impressionable adolescent at the time, it was not only the great playing and arrangements that got me, but the deep and incisive quality of the lyrical content that spoke to the broadening of one’s outlook on the world. So much of it pointed to the possibility of a more unrestrained,  generous, and benevolent society, where all one needed to advance the cause was to seize the optimism and engage in becoming better human beings. Great stuff. And from there, the band continued to remain in step with popular culture, and doing what art reliably does, the Sons continued moving creatively onward with the flow, while never abandoning their definitive R&B roots. They proceeded to produce six more LPs, including their 1973 masterpiece, Welcome to the Dance, which by all that is right in the world should have put them squarely in the center of the national rock music conversation. Based on artistic merit, both musically and lyrically, by all accounts this album was the equal to most anything in the genre coming out of the record industry at the time. Underscoring their stature by this point, Bill Graham introduced the Sons on a fall 1974 evening at Winterland by righteously proclaiming; “These gentlemen have been around as long as we have, and thank God for that. From Marin, The Sons of Champlin.” Oh, yeah.After concluding that nothing comprehensive had ever been written on The Sons’ long and fascinating history, I decided to reach out to Bill and ask if he might  be interested in doing a documentation of this kind. He agreed to meet at his home in Los Angeles, and after an afternoon of lively conversation he decided that this was something he very much wanted to see happen. From there I reached out to the other guys, and here we are.Where will the money go?All the funding generated from this campaign will go directly towards underwriting the remaining travel requirements, editing, proofreading, rewards, supplies and support staff to complete the project. The most pressing financial need is meeting the enormous burden of transcribing the interview content. Once the project was embraced by the band members and began gathering momentum, the stream of personal referrals and related research discoveries began to create a substantial source base. And because this is an oral biography, there are still close to a hundred hours of required interview material that has yet to be transcribed. But despite the host of challenges ahead, you can rest assured that our team has the drive, the talent and the skill to take it where it needs to go from here, and with your support we will make it happen.Budget Breakdown:Project Goal Total: $22,000Interview Transcription: 31%Travel: 17%Video/Photo : 5%Editing: 12%Web Support: 10%Creative Design: 7%Contributor Rewards: 5%Indigogo Costs: 5% Risks and Challenges:From the project’s inception, I have undertaken total responsibility for underwriting the effort.

I’m best known for my philanthropic work in Canada, USA, and Mexico and for being an animal lover. For as far back as I can remember, I have lived my life in service to animals and humans. But at the center of my love for animals are dogs.When we adopted Bella, a Border Collie Miniature Schnauzer mix, she was tiny and grossly underweight due to her mother’s lack of milk. Bella weighed only two pounds.Jo Dibblee with Bella and her siblingsThe connection was instant – Bella adopted us. It was love, at first sight, on the night she scrambled up into my lap. And although Bella was pint-sized, she commanded attention gently and lovingly.Bella at one year Bella's life was far too short, but she changed our world and all who came to know her in unusual ways no one could ever have expected.Bella saved my husband's life - all before she was even two years old. A retired firefighter Michael struggled with PTSD. If not for Bella the story would be very different.The vast majority of first responders: Firefighters, Paramedics, EMTs, Police, and those whose careers are in the Military, Doctors, Veterinarians, Nurses, and sadly the list goes on, all are at significant risk of developing either ASD or PTSD. But anxiety disorders are not restricted to the above careers—so many are suffering in silence. Without Bella, Michael would not be where he is today. I knew her story deserved and needed to be shared so she could help others around the world.Michael having a drink from the firehose after fighting a grueling fire  Bella's Dash helps people with anxiety disorders, changing and saving lives one dog and person at a time.  For those who navigate anxiety disorders and love animals, it is widely known that a deep and endearing bond exists that is unbreakable between dogs and their humans. Bella's Dash and pack tales are a testimony to the power of love in healing.  ""Bellas Dash is a remarkable account of how dogs add love and joy to our lives, healing us in our darkest hours. The memoir shares unique, heart-warming stories that will have you laughing and tearing up; and shows how every dog is special."" Lynn Mckenzie Canada  Bella's Dash and tales from the pack is a legacy project to raise awareness, funds and serve both people and animals in need.  With every pledge for Bella's Dash, we are donating 20% of net proceeds and 20% of all future Bella’s Dash book royalties to S.N.A.P. (Spay, Neuter and Prevention), Cortez Rescue and Outreach, Tobacco Valley Animal Shelter, and Team Humanity. Although this is a book I never wanted to write, I’m so glad I did! And I am even more thrilled and grateful for the tales from the pack – other writers from around the world who had powerful stories to share about their dogs as well.Initially, anxiety, grief, self-doubt, and trepidation kept me from picking up the pen. But there was no getting around it. And after much soul searching, research and volunteering, it was time to write Bella's story. Bella and her pack of tales give new meaning to hope. Although Bella's Dash is a story born out of a tragedy to help both dogs and humans, it is also a story about the power and purpose of dogs in our lives.  And here we are, all paws in. And we need YOU!  My book, Bella's Dash, is a critical component in the kick-off of Team Bella, the legacy project. Bella's Dash and pack tales is a book that will leave you cheering, laughing, and at times crying. It’s about the passion, purpose, and power that animals have in our lives. Bella rescued us and mended the broken pieces. And we know from the early reviews that Bella's Dash is pawsitively needed.  ""Jo Dibblee writes a masterpiece about dogs and their pack members, us humans.""             Bernadette Anderson – Reader Favorites   As much as anxiety and stress are a part of life, they don't have to rule life. Bella's Dash shares through stories, the impact dogs have in our lives. Bella's Dash will educate, empower, impact, and most importantly, save lives and inspire readers to support this legacy.   ""I thoroughly enjoyed every page of Jo Dibblee's story of rescuing Bella, as she tells of how Bella ends up rescuing her and Michael during the dark times of their P.T.S.D. and A.S.D. I like what Dibblee says: 'that Bella met us where we were and took us someplace new.”  Joy Hannabass – USA  By contributing to this campaign at any level, you will:
Launch the Legacy of Bella's Dash 
Support animals rescue, shelters, and outreach programs
Sustain the critical work of spay and neuter clinics (S.N.A.P.) to prevent more unwanted puppies and abandoned dogs
Help share a vital legacy project with the world about the healing, hope, and transformation of humans and their dogs.
Empower those who navigate anxiety disorders and stress by providing a healthy, holistic, and more loving approach to health and wellness
 Most importantly, you will save lives - dogs and humans, as we are giving 20% net proceeds from every donation to Cortez Rescue and Outreach, SNAP (Spay, Neuter and Prevention) Tobacco Valley Animal Shelter, and Team Humanity.          What's not to love? It's Win. Win. Win!  Bella's Dash chronicles the unique bond, healing power, and unwavering love shared between dogs and humans. Book Description Afraid and weak, an abandoned mama dog and her six-pack of wee pups are in dire need. Bella, a tenacious furball, is destined for great things, though she doesn't know it yet. It isn't long before she chooses her humans: a retired firefighter and his wife, a former witness in protection, who themselves are searching for the missing piece of their hearts. Bella's imprint touches all who know her during her short journey through the world.  You'll cry, cheer and laugh your way through the profound emotional impacts that lead to the transformation from grief and trauma to joy and health. Bella's Dash and the pack is a collection of true stories about the power and purpose of adopting the otherwise forgotten while gaining immeasurable love and hope.  ""Jo Dibblee's book, Bella's Dash, is Bella's story. But it's more than that. It's a sharing of other pack stories, for dogs are pack animals, and all of their stories need to be shared. The author speaks from the heart as she shares Bella's stories as well as stories about other rescues. She speaks profoundly of our role as humans in this pack-animal scenario. She makes us challenge the concept that we are the leader of the pack, but, perhaps, dogs really do know best.” -Jane Orford - Readers’ Favorites What We Need - YOU! What You GetYour generosity will be rewarded and greatly appreciated!

<p>PHILANTHROPY: YOU WILL HELP US GIFT BOOKS TO LOCAL ENTITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The project consists of the translation of a book of great historical importance from the original Swedish language, into Spanish and English for a wider audience to enjoy. Today only a small population of Swedish speaking people have access to all the extremely valuable information held within the pages of the 1898 edition of this book.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have in my possession a very important book that describes a scientific journey to a then greatly unknown territory: a territory wrapped in mystique and solitude. This book, even though it is now an antiquity, is written in a very accessible language and describes people that are no longer here and places that still are. Reading this book gives insight to a very decisive point in Patagonian history while the scenes and settings are, if not the same, then very similar to today. The essence and spirit of Patagonia is very well captured in the book and will be recognizable to anyone who has already been here or to those who are about to visit.</span></p>
<p>My name is Dorthe Beldal, and I am presenting this project to you, to give you the opportunity to become part of a meaningful process filled with passion and wonderful people. I am a Scandinavian in Patagonia and with this project I am paying a personal debt I promised myself a long time ago. I need to make the content of this book available where it really matters; in the region where the exploration took place 120 years ago. I am making a dream come true.</p>
<p>This project is about bringing history to life. It is about creating a local impact;  about learning and understanding our past, about empowering the Patagonian Traveller but also about bringing a unique and important historical person back to life.</p>
<p><strong>The Author: Otto Nordenskjöld</strong></p>
<p>In 1895 a very young, Swedish scientist took the mature decision of taking upon himself a sub-polar expedition to an unknown land. Without a grand invasive expedition, he arrived and stayed for 2 years while roaming and exploring the interior region of Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. He was intrigued by many unanswered scientific questions. Otto brought to us several important contributions during his academic career in the Antarctic and Sub Antarctic Environments. One might argue he changed the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>He was the first scientist to venture inland in Tierra del Fuego &amp; Patagonia.</li>
<li>He was the first white man – probably the first man at all – to look upon the Dickson Glacier in Torres del Paine National Park in Chile – and then giving it its name.</li>
<li>He was the one that brought the strange piece of (Mylodon) fur found in a cave in Ultima Esperanza to Buenos Aires and thereby sparking scientific interest in the unknown territory.</li>
<li>Later he brought with him a wooden cabin on his 1901 Antarctic Expedition. This cabin is still present on Snow Hill, today converted into a small Antarctic Museum.</li>
<li>He discovered fossils on the frozen continent that proved a previous connection to the South American Continent and thereby fathering the plate tectonic theory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are working for this translation project to have a social impact. We need to bring this information to those that really need it. All this important information that has been hidden away in a foreign language needs to be delivered to where it belongs.</p>
<p>When reaching our first goal, we will have additionally 300 copies in Spanish. The Spanish version will be given to local libraries and schools so as to create a free and accessible knowledge base throughout the territory.</p>
<p>YOU WILL HELP US GIFT BOOKS TO LOCAL ENTITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES</p>
<p><strong>How is the project being carried out?: Teamwork</strong></p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<p>The book will pass through our hands several times to ensure a translation as close to the original as possible. We want the contemporary journey to be as close to the original. We are a team of professionals - who are driven by our passion and love for this remote territory - bringing together our knowledge and professions to offer this piece of history to the world.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are advancing on our journey according to these <strong>Milestones:</strong></p>
<p>January 2021: Spanish Version: 100%</p>
<p>February 2021: English Version 100%</p>
<p>March + April 2021: Editing, Work on Pictures, Prologue &amp; Introduction</p>
<p>May 2021: PRINT &amp; SHIPPING</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishments to date:</strong></p>
<p>Translation from Swedish: 72 %</p>
<p>Translation to Spanish: 37 %</p>
<p>Translation to English: 5 %</p>
<p><strong>Stretch goal #1 is EUR 15,000 for the translation in 2 languages, editing, print &amp; shipping</strong></p>
<p>Salary (translation and editing): 6.500 Euros **</p>
<p>Print in two languages &amp; shipping to wherever you are: 8.500 Euros</p>
<p>WE HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO COMPROMISE THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK IN ANYWAY. WE ARE WORKING TO BRING HISTORY TO LIFE WITH A LONG-LASTING IMPACT.</p>
<p>** Initially this was a philanthropic project that we, the executers of the project, gave our word and agreed on carrying out voluntarily in our spare time. However, as the process advances and the world is changing, it has become increasingly clear, that incorporating a translation salary in the project, is the only right thing to do. The entire team are employed in tourism with a very complicated season ahead and time spent on this project is even more valuable, as the team are taking their own time away from activities that help them obtain work in other industries.</p>

PHILANTHROPY: YOU WILL HELP US GIFT BOOKS TO LOCAL ENTITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
Summary
The project consists of the translation of a book of great historical importance from the original Swedish language, into Spanish and English for a wider audience to enjoy. Today only a small population of Swedish speaking people have access to all the extremely valuable information held within the pages of the 1898 edition of this book.
I have in my possession a very important book that describes a scientific journey to a then greatly unknown territory: a territory wrapped in mystique and solitude. This book, even though it is now an antiquity, is written in a very accessible language and describes people that are no longer here and places that still are. Reading this book gives insight to a very decisive point in Patagonian history while the scenes and settings are, if not the same, then very similar to today. The essence and spirit of Patagonia is very well captured in the book and will be recognizable to anyone who has already been here or to those who are about to visit.
My name is Dorthe Beldal, and I am presenting this project to you, to give you the opportunity to become part of a meaningful process filled with passion and wonderful people. I am a Scandinavian in Patagonia and with this project I am paying a personal debt I promised myself a long time ago. I need to make the content of this book available where it really matters; in the region where the exploration took place 120 years ago. I am making a dream come true.
This project is about bringing history to life. It is about creating a local impact;  about learning and understanding our past, about empowering the Patagonian Traveller but also about bringing a unique and important historical person back to life.
The Author: Otto Nordenskjöld
In 1895 a very young, Swedish scientist took the mature decision of taking upon himself a sub-polar expedition to an unknown land. Without a grand invasive expedition, he arrived and stayed for 2 years while roaming and exploring the interior region of Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. He was intrigued by many unanswered scientific questions. Otto brought to us several important contributions during his academic career in the Antarctic and Sub Antarctic Environments. One might argue he changed the world:

He was the first scientist to venture inland in Tierra del Fuego & Patagonia.
He was the first white man – probably the first man at all – to look upon the Dickson Glacier in Torres del Paine National Park in Chile – and then giving it its name.
He was the one that brought the strange piece of (Mylodon) fur found in a cave in Ultima Esperanza to Buenos Aires and thereby sparking scientific interest in the unknown territory.
Later he brought with him a wooden cabin on his 1901 Antarctic Expedition. This cabin is still present on Snow Hill, today converted into a small Antarctic Museum.
He discovered fossils on the frozen continent that proved a previous connection to the South American Continent and thereby fathering the plate tectonic theory.

The Impact
We are working for this translation project to have a social impact. We need to bring this information to those that really need it. All this important information that has been hidden away in a foreign language needs to be delivered to where it belongs.
When reaching our first goal, we will have additionally 300 copies in Spanish. The Spanish version will be given to local libraries and schools so as to create a free and accessible knowledge base throughout the territory.
YOU WILL HELP US GIFT BOOKS TO LOCAL ENTITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
How is the project being carried out?: Teamwork

Process:
The book will pass through our hands several times to ensure a translation as close to the original as possible. We want the contemporary journey to be as close to the original. We are a team of professionals - who are driven by our passion and love for this remote territory - bringing together our knowledge and professions to offer this piece of history to the world.


What We Need & What You Get
We are advancing on our journey according to these Milestones:
January 2021: Spanish Version: 100%
February 2021: English Version 100%
March + April 2021: Editing, Work on Pictures, Prologue & Introduction
May 2021: PRINT & SHIPPING
Accomplishments to date:
Translation from Swedish: 72 %
Translation to Spanish: 37 %
Translation to English: 5 %
Stretch goal #1 is EUR 15,000 for the translation in 2 languages, editing, print & shipping
Salary (translation and editing): 6.500 Euros **
Print in two languages & shipping to wherever you are: 8.500 Euros
WE HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO COMPROMISE THE QUALITY OF THE BOOK IN ANYWAY. WE ARE WORKING TO BRING HISTORY TO LIFE WITH A LONG-LASTING IMPACT.
** Initially this was a philanthropic project that we, the executers of the project, gave our word and agreed on carrying out voluntarily in our spare time. However, as the process advances and the world is changing, it has become increasingly clear, that incorporating a translation salary in the project, is the only right thing to do. The entire team are employed in tourism with a very complicated season ahead and time spent on this project is even more valuable, as the team are taking their own time away from activities that help them obtain work in other industries.
Stretch goal #2 is EUR 22,000 for a true treasure hunt to take place
A research trip will be set up through the Nórdica Foundation in Patagonia, Chile!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm a healing artist, and an artistic healer. I grew up in Xi'an and Shanghai, before studying abroad and working/living in the United States and Spain. </p>
<p>I wrote my first suicide note when I was in my second boarding school. My self-worth was as low as dirt. Bullying from various schools that I constantly had to fit in, divorced family with depression, the co-unconciousness of the society... I wetted my bed until I was about 10 or 11 year's old. My blurred speech issues were giving away my social anxiety...and all that went unnoticed. I felt deeply worthless, inferior, and disgusted with myself due to my lack of self-love.</p>
<p>I was troubled by my guilt and shame on a daily basis, as a young Chinese lady.</p>
<p>The idea of being an outsider became more significant to me when I grew up and became a foreigner. With all of those baggages that bled into my first few relationships, my first job (selling Xerox copiers in Northern Virginia and failing at it), mixed with my perpetual self-esteem issues, I somehow managed to flourish and grow.</p>
<p>How? I did everything in my power to find my inner resources, to recognize the compassion that I did experience growing up, to become a giver instead of a taker. I had talk therapy, group therapy, spiritual healing, primal twice-born...I mainly channeled this will to heal into my entrepreneurial projects, because I believe that the real growth happens in the daily life. </p>
<p>My relationship with my roots have changed, once I realized that I needed to ""return to origin"", a Taoism principle. I began to embrace my imperfection and started to celebrate who I am, as who I already have been.</p>
<p>Struggle up, shall we? Experimentatively heal, shall we?</p>
<p>I became a life coach, group facilitator, psychodrama practitioner, and created my own Guang Healing project that involves Tibetan Singing Bowl and energy work...serendipitously, my wounds are letting me heal others.</p>
<p>I want to tell my honest story and show you how I healed and transformed my trauma, as well as how I heal others...mostly, how I cope and turn my trauma into fuel...or a source of clean energy.</p>
<p>This would be a digital art book about that, with my naked heart.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You will get a digital art book. :D It's full of inspirations and self-love related healing tools. A sense of humor can always be found in my attempt to heal. So, this could be quite heart-felt but amusing. This book could inspire you to self-heal and self-coach, and to experiment something new with even more grit and courage in your life.</p>
<p>You can also choose to get a private recorded sound healing session, or a few personal therapeutic coaching sessions. :D</p>
<p>The money raised will contribute to the production of the digital art book and paying for the tuition of the last year of my graduate school in psychodrama therapy. If we raise plenty, then we can try to make it on print in the future too. No promises for that one yet! Let's see. :D</p>

<p>My name is Adam Misner, and I'm an author looking to put a wholesome love story out into the world. Often I run into stories with love triangles that sap my enthusiasm for the couple, cheating or other drama that bums me out, and melancholic endings from writers afraid their story wont be seen as deep if they write a happy ending. I wanted to rebel against that trend and make something happy. If I've done my job right, my story should linger in the back of your mind and put a smile on your face, from time to time, when you remember a moment from it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story begins with Simon, a skinny, blonde, twenty something who's reeling from a rough breakup. To cope, he gets himself to Disney World and mindlessly rides a roller coaster there, again and again, doing his best to keep himself from thinking. Through the crowd he's noticed by Morrigan, a ride attendant. She's a goth chick born a thousand miles away, with very little in common with him, but she can recognize a kindred spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p>The book's already written, and in its final stages of editing. Barring a bolt from Zeus, I <i>will </i>publish this book, hence the flexible funding. The money is meant to cover the cost of art and printing. If the goal isn't met I'll still have the books printed out of pocket.</p>
<p>Don't take this to mean your contribution isn't valuable, however. What the funding goal doesn't represent is the value of the many many hours spent over two years to write this book. I spent those hours because I love to write, and I'll spend many more for the same reason, but your financial support will help me  to contribute more time to this fulfilling work and inspire me. Knowing that other people value and enjoy what I create, moves me deeply.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div> <h3>Other ways you can help,</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, it'd still be incredibly helpful if you'd spread the word. Even if you just know one friend who's on an IV drip of Hallmark movies, to get some positivity into their life, tell them about my book and I think you'd make the both of us very happy.</p>

<p>The 7 Forms of Respect™ is a framework for understanding how to give and ask for respect in a way that facilitates productive communication and collaboration.</p>
<p>I’m Dr. Julie Pham and I've developed the 7 Forms of Respect™. I have 15+ years of experience bringing people of diverse backgrounds together. A lot of my personal experience has informed my research. I grew up in a bicultural household, American at school, Vietnamese at home. I’ve lived in five different countries. I’ve built partnerships among unlikely allies across ethnic, social-economic, industry, and political divides. I’ve worked in academia, at my family’s Vietnamese newspaper, in tech companies, and with nonprofits.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in rapidly changing communities where new and different perspectives have created cultural clashes. We’ve seen how social media and remote work can make it easy to judge those we don’t know as we emerge from the pandemic. And now we are making snap judgments even about those we do know, whether at work or at home. Our own judgment is tearing apart our ability to collaborate and communicate. It’s easy to feel disrespected. Without a shared understanding of respect, it’s harder to articulate how respect and disrespect can look and feel.</p>
<p>This book will give you an understanding of what Forms of Respect™ you value and how to communicate that to others.  The shared language I will teach you can help you collaborate with any group of people from coworkers to volunteers. While anyone can benefit from reading this book, I’ve targeted individual contributors, team managers, and executives. </p>
<p>I wrote this book to illustrate that respect is relative and not absolute or universal. I want to help you stop wasting time guessing what you should do, and start learning what really matters to you and to others. You will build self-awareness and empathy. You’ll be able to focus your energy on your relationships to achieve greater impact. </p>
<p><strong>The book is designed for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Those who want to increase their own self-awareness</p></li>
<li><p>Those who want to build trusting relationships</p></li>
<li><p>Those who want to lead diverse organizations more effectively</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In this book, you will: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn how to apply the 7 Forms of Respect™ </p></li>
<li><p>Learn the difference between giving and getting respect</p></li>
<li><p>Reflect on the Forms of Respect™ that truly matter to you</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to work with those who have different Forms of Respect™ </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The book is outlined as follows:</strong></p>
<p><u>Part 1: The Dimensions</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Give respect vs. get respect. How you demonstrate or give respect often differs from how we want to receive it.</li>
<li>What really matters to you. Move beyond what you should do. Ask yourself, what do you feel like you must do, could do, and won’t do.</li>
<li>Hierarchy. How do you interact with people who have more power, equal power, and less power than you? Do you treat them differently? Do you have different expectations?</li>
</ul>

<p>Julie Pham, Ph.D. is CEO, <a href=""https://curiositybased.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CuriosityBased</a>, which helps teams and organizations build connection, collaboration, and inclusion through fostering curiosity. She also advocates and promotes leadership narratives written by women and people of color.</p>
<p>Before starting CuriosityBased, she led community engagement at Washington Technology Industry Association, where she created the Ion Program, a cross-sector collaboration fellowship. She has also worked in marketing at Microsoft and Avidian Technologies.

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>B.C. Allen Press will help produce the book. I set up the pre-order tiers to offset the costs of publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in October 2021.</p></li>
<li><p>The cover design of my book. </p></li>
<li><p>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p></li>
<li><p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p></li>

<li><p>The automation of the results page for the assessment tool.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into the pricing.</p>
<p>I will personally mail the signed pre-sales copies of the books to you. You will get a survey at the end of the campaign to ensure I inscribe the book as you’d like.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Your contribution will make it possible for me to get this work out into the world faster and without the time constraints of traditional publishing. </p>
<p>You will get to be part of a movement in changing the conversation around respect. One day, you’ll hear people ask each other, “What are your Forms of Respect™? Mine are….” People will be able to approach each other with more empathy because they understand that others may have different ways of expressing respect.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>I understand that not everyone can contribute and there are other ways you can help. Most people hear about books from their friends or colleagues and I would love for you to tell yours:</p>

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Most people know me as a filmmaker (<i>The Heart of the Game, The Bowmaker</i>s, etc.). Few however, know my background as a former CPA who ran off to the wilds of Alaska with a remarkable yellow Labrador named Woody in pursuit of a fierce freedom.</p>
<p>On the maiden voyage in our <i>dogyak</i>—a specially fitted kayak<i>—</i>Woody and l rounded a point into a half-moon bay with rugged coastline. There, sixteen miles from town on the rough, steep bank, accessible only by boat, sat a small gray house on stilts. In the shadow of ancient spruce and cedars, with a waterfall on one side and the ocean below, we took up a years-long vigil in the place I came to call <i>Shakri-La.</i></p>
<p>This campaign is to raise support to publish my first book about this adventure: <strong>To Crack the World Open: <i>Solitude, Alaska and a Dog Named Woody.</i></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why it Matters</strong></h3>
<p>This book is a life long dream come true. I’ve crafted it over the past 25 years. And I can’t realize it without a community that believes in dreams and the power of personal story to make this world a more habitable, kind and generous place.</p>
<p>You will help me launch an independent book that has the potential to create more connection and belonging in our world. A book that expresses the deep felt and poignant love of a dog that carries a message of inherent and personal freedom, a universal search that is as much exterior as it is interior.</p>
<p>In short, by becoming a producer of this book, you will help bring more understanding and soul into the world.</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need </strong></h3>
<p>This book will be published on November 2nd!</p>
<p>Publishing a book these days is an arduous and expensive ordeal. I need $15,000 to pay for the final copy editing and proofreading, the book cover and interior design, as well as marketing and promotion. In addition you will be funding the creation of a podcast, <strong><i>Chew The Bone</i></strong> with cosmic dog psychologist, Dr. Woody, as well as the design and launch of a book website.</p>
<p>I have secured the services of Girl Friday Productions, one of the leading indie publishers to get this work done. I wish to raise 50% of that amount or $7,500 through this campaign.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>You will be among the first in the world to own a first edition personally signed book. The street date for the book in November 2 and you will have yours in October before any one else does. I’ve added a bunch of other fun and meaningful perks for those inspired to help more.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond the financial challenges of creating this book, to lay one’s soul bare via a memoir is scary work. In order to write it, I had to delve into the recesses of the deepest trauma and address the raw vulnerabilities therein. At times, the writing brought me to my knees and opened floodgates of tears.</p>
<p>My work is based on stories that heal and inspire. I wouldn’t put this book out if not for the belief that it will create more connection and meaning in the world.</p>
<p>It is vulnerable to ask for help. It is vulnerable to ask for community. But the reward is deeper intimacy and inherent belonging.</p>
<p>I thank thee deeply.</p>
<p>Woof!</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>A book only succeeds via word of mouth. I would adore it if you would share this with your <strong>dog loving friends</strong> or those who you feel would benefit from a story about <strong>the universal search for freedom.</strong></p>
<p>Generating a unique post of Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok or other media helps as well as a personal email to a friend.</p>
<p>Please ask you local bookstore to carry it.</p>
<p>Bless you!</p>

When they stopped, the creature stopped too. It was changing its look from a stack of hay to a poorly built shed! Something impossible in the Soviet no-belief reality but... </p><p>This and other stories of my grandmother have inspired me to learn more about Belarusian mythology and bring it back to life. If there are so many fantasy books with completely imaginary characters, why don’t tell children about thousands years old beliefs? While some of them are still even alive in the people’s hearts? </p><p>Belarusian traditions and culture are not very famous abroad. It’s often overshadowed by Russian or Polish influences, which are all Slavic nations and have much in common, but there are still a lot of differences in how they see non-material life and its laws. It is nice to show children all the diversity and richness of world traditions and I hope this book will have an added value for children of any origin. </p><p>Children are open to new things and in our time of digital short-clip information sharing it is important to cherish their reading skills, practicing other languages and creative perception - this is what we tried to incorporate into these books along with humour and mythology...</p><p>---</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Наша кампанія завершана і кніга надрукаваная!</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Вы можаце набыць кнігу праз: </h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.openbelarus.nl/13spirits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.openbelarus.nl/13spirits</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.volhamilovich.com/13spirits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.volhamilovich.com/13spirits</a></p><p> </p><h3>Прывітанне! </h3><ul>

</ul><p><i>Гэтак жа мы працуем над другой часткай кнігі 13. Істоты: Старажытныя і Вечныя.</i></p><h3>Гісторыя</h3><p>У першай кнізе серыі 13. Духі. Заўсёды побач! Бай, самы старажытны Дух на Зямлі, які ведае напамяць ўсе легенды, размаўляе з 13 прыроднымі духамі.</p><p>Духі расказваюць яму пра сваё незвычайнае, часам цяжкае, бязцелеснае жыццё. Яны дзеляцца тым, што ім падабаецца у людзях і што іх раздражняе; чым яны робяць у прыродзе і чаму.</p><p>Смешныя ці сумныя, гэтыя Духі часта адлюстроўваюць пачуцці і звычкі людзей. Гісторыі і персанажы заснаваны на вераваннях беларусаў, сабраных з энцыклапедычных крыніц.</p><p>Дзеці і дарослыя змогуць убачыць неймаверна багатую спадчыну беларускай міфалогіі, адказаць на квіз Бая, знайсці новыя факты пра Духаў і многае іншае - усё ў лёгкай, гульнявой форме. Кніга 13 духаў. Заўседы побач. - гэта не толькі зборнік выдатных гісторый. У кніжцы шмат “развівалак” для дзяцей і дарослых, каб папрактыкавацца ў мовах, трэніраваць памяць і творчасць.</p><h3>Пра нас</h3><p>Усё пачалося яшчэ ў 2016 годзе, калі ў Амстэрдаме сустрэліся две творчыя беларускі: Таццяна, актывістка беларускай культуры і Вольга, дызайнер лялек і ілюстратар. Ніколі не губляючы сувязі з каранямі і, у прыватнасці,з славянскай народнай культурай, мы вырашылі падзяліцца сваім захапленнем з еўрапейскай і амерыканскай публікай і беларускімі эмігрантамі па ўсім свеце.<br/>Мы вывучалі энцыклапедыі і крыніцы беларускай класічнай літаратуры, размаўлялі са сталымі людзьмі, каб пазнаёміцца ​​з іх гісторыямі, намаляваць хоць як прыкладна выглядаюць Духі.</p><p><strong>Таццяна:</strong></p><p>З дзяцінства я памятаю песні пра Бая (які ходзіць па сцяне..) і гісторыі маёй бабулі пра дзіўныя з'явы, якія час ад часу адбываліся ў беларускіх палях і лясах.<br/> <br/>Як, напрыклад, вось такая гісторыя: аднойчы сям'я маёй бабулі накіроўвалася дадому з іншай вёскі, і ў прыцемках яны ўбачылі дзіўнае стварэнне, якое ішло побач з імі. Калі яны спыніліся, істота таксама спынілася. Яна мяняла свой выгляд - то была як стог сена, то як дрэнна пабудаваны хлеў! Нешта немагчымае ў той савецкай рэчаіснасці, дзе ніякай веры не было ўвогуле, а тут такое...<br/> <br/>Гэтая і іншыя гісторыі маёй бабулі натхнілі мяне даведацца больш пра беларускую міфалогію і вярнуць яе да папулярнасьці. Калі ёсць так шмат кніг жанра фэнтазі з цалкам надуманымі персанажамі, чаму б не расказаць дзецям пра традыцыйных герояў, у якіх людзі верылі тысячагоддзі? А колькі яшчэ павер’яў жывыя ў сэрцах людзей!</p><p>За мяжой беларускія традыцыі і культура не вельмі вядомыя.

You can order a book through our websites: www.openbelarus.nl/13spiritswww.volhamilovich.com/13spirits What we're asking you to fund
This campaign is a pre-sale to get sufficient fund (€4.500) to being able to publish our book, the story of 13 real Spirits from the Belarusian mythology
Hardcover book 23x23cm with 64 pages
The book will be printed bilingual in Belarusian & English
Our stories are for 6-99 year olds who are interested in the magical world of supernatural and in Belarusian cultural heritage
When we reach our target, we'll need about a month to print the book and start shippings
If we unexpectedly don't reach our target, and we won't find any alternative funding to fill up the budget, you'll get your money back and we won't print our book
With Covid in mind, we'll be very cautious to respect all rules and guidelines regarding distribution and postage
If this campaign is successful, later this year we will publish Dutch/Russian version.Also we work on the second edition of the book 13. The Beings: Ancient and Eternal.The StoryIn the first book of the series 13. The Spirits. They are so close! Bye - the oldest Spirit on Earth, who knows all the legends, talks to 13 natural Spirits. The Spirits tell him about their unusual, sometimes difficult, bodiless lives. They share what they fancy about people and what annoys them; what they do in nature and why. Funny or sad, these Spirits often mirror people’s feelings and habits.  The stories & characters are based on the beliefs of Belarusians collected from encyclopedic sources.The book is not only about reading great stories. There are plenty of activities for kids and adults to practice languages, memory and DIY. About usIt all started back in 2016, when two Belarusians creative minds met in Amsterdam: me, Tatsiana, Belarusian culture activist, mother of two and Volha, puppet theatre designer and illustrator. We have never lost our connection to the roots and, to the Slavic folk culture in particular, so we decided to share our passion with European and American public and, of course, with the expats. We studied encyclopedias and Belarusian classical literature sources, talked to older people to get to know their stories, draw the Spirits look and here we go: a wonderful selection of natural Spirits and Creatures stories was created!Since I was a child, I remember songs about Bye and my grandmother’s stories about strange phenomena which took place in the fields and forests of Belarusian countryside from time to time.Like, for instance, this one: on a usual day my grandmother’s family was heading home from another village and in the twilight they saw a weird creature walking along with them. When they stopped, the creature stopped too. It was changing its look from a stack of hay to a poorly built shed! Something impossible in the Soviet no-belief reality but... This and other stories of my grandmother have inspired me to learn more about Belarusian mythology and bring it back to life. If there are so many fantasy books with completely imaginary characters, why don’t tell children about thousands years old beliefs? While some of them are still even alive in the people’s hearts? Belarusian traditions and culture are not very famous abroad. It’s often overshadowed by Russian or Polish influences, which are all Slavic nations and have much in common, but there are still a lot of differences in how they see non-material life and its laws. It is nice to show children all the diversity and richness of world traditions and I hope this book will have an added value for children of any origin. Children are open to new things and in our time of digital short-clip information sharing it is important to cherish their reading skills, practicing other languages and creative perception - this is what we tried to incorporate into these books along with humour and mythology...---Наша кампанія завершана і кніга надрукаваная!Вы можаце набыць кнігу праз: www.openbelarus.nl/13spiritswww.volhamilovich.com/13spirits Прывітанне! 
Мы запрашаем вас узяць ўдзел у нашым праекце - выданні кніжкі аб 13 сапраўдных духах з беларускай міфалогіі
Гэтая кампанія з'яўляецца папярэднім продажам кнігі
Нам трэба сабраць 4500 еўра, каб мець магчымасць выдаць гэтую кнігу
Кніга ў цвёрдай вокладцы 23х23 см з 64 старонкамі высокай якасці і цудоўнымі ілюстрацыямі
Першае выданне будзе надрукавана на дзвюх мовах: беларускай і англійскай (паралельны тэкст), у наступным друку будзе магчыма набыць кніжку на нідэрландскай і рускай мовах
Кніжка будзе выдатным падарункам для дзяцей і дарослых (ад 6-99 гадоў), якія цікавяцца светам звышнатуральнага і беларускай культурнай спадчынай
Калі мэта дасягнута, нам спатрэбіцца каля месяца, каб надрукаваць кнігу і пачаць дастаўку
Калі па якім-небудзь абставінам мы не збяром неабходную на выданне суму, вы атрымаеце назад свае грошы
Улічваючы сітуацыю з Ковід-19, мы будзем дакладна выконваць усе рэкамендацыі, якія тычацца паштовых адпраўленняў
Гэтак жа мы працуем над другой часткай кнігі 13. Істоты: Старажытныя і Вечныя.ГісторыяУ першай кнізе серыі 13. Духі. Заўсёды побач! Бай, самы старажытны Дух на Зямлі, які ведае напамяць ўсе легенды, размаўляе з 13 прыроднымі духамі.Духі расказваюць яму пра сваё незвычайнае, часам цяжкае, бязцелеснае жыццё. Яны дзеляцца тым, што ім падабаецца у людзях і што іх раздражняе; чым яны робяць у прыродзе і чаму.Смешныя ці сумныя, гэтыя Духі часта адлюстроўваюць пачуцці і звычкі людзей. Гісторыі і персанажы заснаваны на вераваннях беларусаў, сабраных з энцыклапедычных крыніц.Дзеці і дарослыя змогуць убачыць неймаверна багатую спадчыну беларускай міфалогіі, адказаць на квіз Бая, знайсці новыя факты пра Духаў і многае іншае - усё ў лёгкай, гульнявой форме. Кніга 13 духаў. Заўседы побач. - гэта не толькі зборнік выдатных гісторый. У кніжцы шмат “развівалак” для дзяцей і дарослых, каб папрактыкавацца ў мовах, трэніраваць памяць і творчасць.Пра насУсё пачалося яшчэ ў 2016 годзе, калі ў Амстэрдаме сустрэліся две творчыя беларускі: Таццяна, актывістка беларускай культуры і Вольга, дызайнер лялек і ілюстратар. Ніколі не губляючы сувязі з каранямі і, у прыватнасці,з славянскай народнай культурай, мы вырашылі падзяліцца сваім захапленнем з еўрапейскай і амерыканскай публікай і беларускімі эмігрантамі па ўсім свеце.Мы вывучалі энцыклапедыі і крыніцы беларускай класічнай літаратуры, размаўлялі са сталымі людзьмі, каб пазнаёміцца ​​з іх гісторыямі, намаляваць хоць як прыкладна выглядаюць Духі.Таццяна:З дзяцінства я памятаю песні пра Бая (які ходзіць па сцяне..) і гісторыі маёй бабулі пра дзіўныя з'явы, якія час ад часу адбываліся ў беларускіх палях і лясах. Як, напрыклад, вось такая гісторыя: аднойчы сям'я маёй бабулі накіроўвалася дадому з іншай вёскі, і ў прыцемках яны ўбачылі дзіўнае стварэнне, якое ішло побач з імі. Калі яны спыніліся, істота таксама спынілася. Яна мяняла свой выгляд - то была як стог сена, то як дрэнна пабудаваны хлеў! Нешта немагчымае ў той савецкай рэчаіснасці, дзе ніякай веры не было ўвогуле, а тут такое... Гэтая і іншыя гісторыі маёй бабулі натхнілі мяне даведацца больш пра беларускую міфалогію і вярнуць яе да папулярнасьці. Калі ёсць так шмат кніг жанра фэнтазі з цалкам надуманымі персанажамі, чаму б не расказаць дзецям пра традыцыйных герояў, у якіх людзі верылі тысячагоддзі? А колькі яшчэ павер’яў жывыя ў сэрцах людзей!За мяжой беларускія традыцыі і культура не вельмі вядомыя. Яны часта знаходзяцца ў цені рускага ці польскага уплыву, якія, зразумела, разам з іншымі славянскімі нацыямі маюць шмат агульнага. Але ўсё ж існуе шмат адрозненняў у тым, як яны бачаць нематэрыяльнае жыццё і яго законы. Хочацца паказаць дзецям усю разнастайнасць і багацце сусветных традыцый, і я спадзяюся, што гэтая кніга будзе мець дадатковую каштоўнасць для дзяцей любога паходжання.Дзеці адкрыты для новага, і ў наш час дыгітальных тэхналогій, вельмі важна шанаваць іх навыкі чытання, разуменне іншых моваў і творчае ўспрыманне свету - мы паспрабавалі ўключыць усё гэта ў нашы кнігі разам з гумарам і міфалогіяй...P.S.

<h3><strong>A Novel About Music, People, East Nashville, and a Miracle</strong></h3>
<p><strong>By John J. Thompson</strong></p>
<p>    Hello from East Nashville. I’m excited to tell you about my new book. It’s my third book, but my first novel. It’s almost finished, but I’m going to need your help to get it across the finish line and into the world. This is a book I have been developing for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>    The story is about how music brings a diverse community of characters together to accomplish something miraculous when they least expect it. The book is based upon people I have known, pieces of stories I have heard, and is set right here in East Nashville. It even includes some real events from East Nashville history. However, this is really a musical fable. It’s a story about tragedy, gentrification, and reconciliation. It’s about Rock and Soul and Americana and Tejano and Gospel music setting an unlikely tribe of people on fire in the best possible way.<br/> </p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; Why</strong></h3>
<p>     I completed my first draft of this book more than a year ago. Since then, I have worked with two copy editors to hunt down typos, grammatical mistakes, and other errors that are difficult to see when you’re up to your eyeballs in a 98,000-word manuscript. (That's 210 pages in MSWord, at 12 point type, double spaced, for those who are curious.) Three revisions later, I have a draft that I feel pretty good about. But when I was working on my previous book, <a href=""https://www.truetunes.com/jesus-bread-chocolate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>J</i></a><i><a href=""https://www.truetunes.com/jesus-bread-chocolate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">esus, Bread, and Chocolate</a></i><a href=""https://www.truetunes.com/jesus-bread-chocolate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">,</a> I learned that one thing a good publisher can bring to the process of releasing a book is the help of a different kind of editor.</p>
<p>     Unlike copy editors, who mostly focus on mechanics, these specialists look at ""high level"" stuff - structural things that can help the flow of the story. This type of editor can look at the manuscript from a 30,000-foot view and make suggestions that go way beyond grammatical errors. I have actually done this kind of editing for another writer, helping to refine a book that was released by a major publisher. I know and appreciate how this process works, but I can't do that kind of work for myself. I'm too close to the words. In much the same way that a record producer benefits an artist’s creative process by providing outside perspective, an effective editor is often the difference between a good book and a great one. This type of support costs money, though. I have found an excellent and proven editor who is excited to work with me on my book. I also need to hire a designer to help me make the thing look and feel as cool as possible. That also has a price tag. There are also technical aspects of publishing, marketing expenses, and more. And extra funds are something that 2020 made sure to relieve me of last year. </p>
<p>     I’m not sure whether I will ultimately work with a publisher for distribution, self-publish, or possibly start my own imprint. I do know that I want to bring this story in for the best landing that I can manage. Your help will make that happen.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>A Soundtrack?</strong></h3>
<p>     You may know that I have also been writing and recording music for more than 30 years. My ""band"" <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/5hqUCL11nlSz62nGLZRG0i?si=nAa0ECEJQZqRg4Y2wXkEYA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wayside</a> has for many years consisted of my wife, <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/6icTW1ey1Orexkkp1p4hhD?si=IMlxa3hGQdSh2CoD2zHxGA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michelle Lynn Thompson</a>, and myself along with a rotating cast of friends and contributors. The group is long overdue to release new music. Since this is a musical book – and I happen to have a fantastic musical partner by my side and lots of musical friends all around me –there will definitely be music connected to this project. I have already written three new songs that reflect elements of the story, and there are numerous cover songs discussed in the pages. If this fund-raising campaign is successful, some new music will come out as a sort of soundtrack to the book. The more support we raise, the more music we can make. One song will be released digitally to backers as a special thank you as soon as it is completed. Additional recording will happen as ""stretch goals"" once we meet our initial financial objectives. More information will be posted to backers and on my social media feeds as the campaign unfolds. <br/> </p>
<h3><strong>How Does It All Work?     </strong></h3>
<p>     Those who back this campaign will help me finish the book, raise funds for its release and launch, and hopefully allow me to record some of the music from the story. In return, backers will get an early copy of the book in digital or physical form (or both) and some fun extras. You’ll be getting something rare, heartfelt, and very special. This will be something even more exclusive than a ""first edition,"" to be sure. This is definitely more than a storefront, though. You're investing in me and helping to bring this story into the world. You are my patron. </p>
<p>      Since there is a somewhat unlikely “band” at the center of this story, I’m making some very limited “merch” to accompany the campaign. Instead of having a T-shirt, mug, hat, or whatever swag with a book title on it, though, we’ll be making some fun merch that is taken from the story. I promise it will make more sense once you’ve read the book. I'll also be hosting different types of Zoom events and offering some personal one-on-one time for song critiques, consulting, writing coaching, or anything else I might be able to help you with. There’s even a level at which I’ll name a character after you or for you.</p>
<p>      Backers will also be added to a group of “insiders” who will receive excerpts from the book, “behind the scenes” reflections, reports from the journey to the finish line, access to a backers-only live stream event, and a digital copy to read before anyone else sees the book! There may even be some exclusive content from the book that only backers ever see – maybe an extra chapter or a bit of backstory. You’ll have to wait and see. I can’t let all of the secrets out just yet.</p>
<p>     I anticipate the early edition going to backers sometime this spring (estimating May 2021). If I decide to work with a publisher, the final release date could be later. But you’ll be among the first handful of people to get it directly from me.</p>
<p>      I’m setting the fundraising goal pretty low, but my vision is actually pretty big. If I can raise enough, the support will spill over into recording more music, having a promotional budget for the book, and maybe helping to set things up for my next book (already underway). So, back me if you can, as generously as you can, and know that your investment will be put to good use.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Instant Gratification! </strong></h3>
<p>   I’ve chosen a special excerpt from the story that I will send to all backers shortly after your pledge is collected. I can’t guarantee that this excerpt won’t change when the book is finished, but I think you’ll enjoy it. I’m also planning to record an acoustic demo of one of the brand-new songs. I’ll send a streaming link to all backers as soon as that song is ready.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>I'm Depending On You</strong></h3>
<p>     I would surely appreciate it if you would post this to your friends and family. Without a big budget for paid social media outlets, your posts really help. Just copy the URL and post it on Facebook, Twitter, or anywhere else. Thank you very much!</p>
<p>     If you can't support this campaign right now, I understand. Times are beyond tight for too many of us. So, please know that I appreciate your moral support. I appreciate you telling other people about this campaign. I appreciate your goodwill and positive energy and prayers. Once the book is out in the world, I'm sure we'll be able to find a way to get the story to anyone who wants to read it. Don't feel bad if you can't contribute now, and please don't contribute more than you can afford.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>     Although I have calculated the costs very conservatively, there are always risks associated with campaigns such as this. I am fortunate in that I have experience managing past crowdfunding campaigns, as well as a complicated merch program with my previous book. I'm not particularly worried about the risks related to the ability to fulfill our obligations to backers. One challenge will be the schedule, but I believe that has been mitigated to a great degree by waiting to launch this campaign until the book was nearly done. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>If you have any questions or concerns, just ask.</strong> Otherwise, jump in and then invite your friends to join you. This is going to be a fun journey for us to complete together!</p>

<h3><strong>Quotes about JJT, <i>Jesus, Bread, and Chocolate</i>, True Tunes Podcast, etc…</strong></h3>
<p>“I’ve enjoyed reading John’s works for years. His writing is always insightful and thought-provoking on many levels. Personally, he was a huge help to me when I wrote <i>Rebel for God.”</i> <strong>(Eddie DeGarmo)</strong></p>
<p>[Re: <strong>The True Tunes Podcast</strong>] JJT (and producer Bruce A, Brown) are creating an amazing piece of art themselves week to week, talking about other great art! I love their phrase “listen to better music, and listen to music – better.” I am reminded of some of the best music of my life here – but also have been introduced to amazing new stuff… <strong>(Chris Hauser)</strong></p>
<p><i>“Jesus, Bread, and Chocolate</i> is fresh and enlightening. John’s stories and his memories of discovering and rediscovering music and the power of the arts remind me that it is all spiritual as it weaves itself into the fabric of our lives. I see why the psalmist implores us to “taste and see that the Lord is good.” <strong>(Phil Keaggy, songwriter, recording artist, guitarist)</strong></p>
<p>“In <i>Jesus, Bread and Chocolate</i>, John J. Thompson serves up a delectable mix of personal story, keen observations of evangelical culture, and scriptural reflection. The result is a filling and satisfying meal for the growing number of people in our churches who are starving for something more substantial than consumer Christianity.” <strong>(C. Christopher Smith, coauthor of <i>Slow Church</i> and editor of The Englewood Review of Books)</strong></p>
<p><i>Jesus, Bread, and Chocolate: Crafting a Handmade Faith in a Mass-Market World </i> is a quick, pleasant read, enjoyable, full of great stories, even inspiring ones that brought tears to my eyes more than once. It, too, is an important voice calling us to some humane values and life-giving habits that are vital in our hyper-modern, digital age. <strong>(Byron Borger, Hearts and Minds Books)</strong></p>
<p>“Thompson has a faithful heart and soul and a clear sense of what it means, as a person of faith, to move from that which is tasteless and unfulfilling about a mass-produced experience, whether in food, libation or worship, to something much more wholesome and unique. His book is a call to the same kind of uniqueness and authenticity in faith and worship. There is a twang in this author’s narrative that can be embraced just like a true bluegrass lyric or your mom’s best peach pie.” <strong>(Jennifer Burns Lewis, Englewood Review of Books) </strong></p>
<p>“It’s rare to find a member of our industry who is as passionate and knowledgeable about both Black Gospel music and contemporary Christian music as John Thompson.  He is a true aficionado of all aspects of Christian music, from our earliest roots to the cutting edge of today’s independent and emerging scene. He has helped coordinate events, has served as a teacher of next generation artists, and has helped as a consensus builder with various aspects and cultures within our industry.” <strong>(Jackie Patillo, President &amp; Executive Director; Gospel Music Association)</strong></p>
<p>“John Thompson has been a true asset to The Recording Academy over the last decade that I have had the pleasure of working with him personally. Overseeing the Gospel/CCM awards process, I rely on experts such as John to decipher and uphold the integrity of the awards process. I am truly amazed to see someone who has this amount of passion for their craft<strong>.”  (Angela Jollivette, Senior Project Manager, Gospel &amp; Visual Media Awards; The Recording Academy)</strong></p>

</div></div>","A Novel About Music, People, East Nashville, and a Miracle
By John J. Thompson
    Hello from East Nashville. I’m excited to tell you about my new book. It’s my third book, but my first novel. It’s almost finished, but I’m going to need your help to get it across the finish line and into the world. This is a book I have been developing for nearly a decade.
    The story is about how music brings a diverse community of characters together to accomplish something miraculous when they least expect it. The book is based upon people I have known, pieces of stories I have heard, and is set right here in East Nashville. It even includes some real events from East Nashville history. However, this is really a musical fable. It’s a story about tragedy, gentrification, and reconciliation. It’s about Rock and Soul and Americana and Tejano and Gospel music setting an unlikely tribe of people on fire in the best possible way.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <i>Anthology of Prayer</i> is an Eastern Orthodox prayer book which for the first time in English incorporates the Book of Hours with a significant selection of fundamental hymns and prayers from the Church's liturgical cycles. This provides the ordinary Christian at home with a form of the rich prayers of the Church in a single, affordable, pocket-sized book, much as the <i>Breviary</i> does for Western Christians.</p>

<p>While there are abundant prayer books available, with new ones appearing all the time, seemingly tailor-made for virtually every demographic, we wanted to get back to the basics. </p>
<p>The Church's cycle of daily prayers is for everyone, and predates every prayer book. We know from ancient sources that for large portions of the Church's history, it was expected that everyday Christians would pray the Daily Office at home or at church: Matins, the Hours, and Vespers. But with few parish churches today offering anything close to a daily cycle of services, the serious layman must maintain the prayers at home.</p>
<p>The Book of Hours (<i>Horologion</i>) is available from other publishers, but we have found that none really incorporate the Church's liturgical cycles into the prayers, rather offering only the basic frameworks. Yet in her wisdom, the Church has found a certain amount of variety is needed to bring richness to the prayers, keeping the Daily Office from becoming stale and difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>The challenge is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single book offers very little of the variation of the Church's liturgical cycles.</li>
<li>A complete liturgical library is beyond the means of most ordinary people. </li>
</ul>
<p>We need something in between these two extremes. And the Church offers it: a book called the <i>Anthologion</i>.

<p>Essentially similar to the <i>Breviary</i> of Western Christianity, the Anthology of Prayer (<i>Anthologion</i>) is a simplified selection of the Church's liturgical texts, designed so any person, with just a little study, could maintain the daily cycle of prayers at home, with its fundamental daily variations: the 8-week tone cycle, major feast days, and the Lenten and Paschal seasons.</p>
<p>The Anthology's opportunities can grow along with the individual's own spiritual growth. Perhaps one might begin with just one or two of the Hours per day: they are brief and simple.

<p>We think the Anthology of Prayer is the golden mean, accessible to all and offering a great amount of flexibility and rich variety for the development of one's prayer life, while keeping traditional and firmly-established borders and frameworks, avoiding the fragmentation of our common prayer that comes about through a great variety of books.</p>

Overview
The Anthology of Prayer is an Eastern Orthodox prayer book which for the first time in English incorporates the Book of Hours with a significant selection of fundamental hymns and prayers from the Church's liturgical cycles. This provides the ordinary Christian at home with a form of the rich prayers of the Church in a single, affordable, pocket-sized book, much as the Breviary does for Western Christians.
Why another prayer book?
While there are abundant prayer books available, with new ones appearing all the time, seemingly tailor-made for virtually every demographic, we wanted to get back to the basics. 
The Church's cycle of daily prayers is for everyone, and predates every prayer book. We know from ancient sources that for large portions of the Church's history, it was expected that everyday Christians would pray the Daily Office at home or at church: Matins, the Hours, and Vespers. But with few parish churches today offering anything close to a daily cycle of services, the serious layman must maintain the prayers at home.
The Book of Hours (Horologion) is available from other publishers, but we have found that none really incorporate the Church's liturgical cycles into the prayers, rather offering only the basic frameworks. Yet in her wisdom, the Church has found a certain amount of variety is needed to bring richness to the prayers, keeping the Daily Office from becoming stale and difficult to maintain.
The challenge is this:

A single book offers very little of the variation of the Church's liturgical cycles.
A complete liturgical library is beyond the means of most ordinary people. 

We need something in between these two extremes. And the Church offers it: a book called the Anthologion. Before the rise of cheap publishing, many parishes only owned this single book, which offered an anthology, or simplified selection, of the full body of Church hymns. In modern times this text has fallen out of use, but it is an ideal solution for the ordinary Christian at home.
Essentially similar to the Breviary of Western Christianity, the Anthology of Prayer (Anthologion) is a simplified selection of the Church's liturgical texts, designed so any person, with just a little study, could maintain the daily cycle of prayers at home, with its fundamental daily variations: the 8-week tone cycle, major feast days, and the Lenten and Paschal seasons.

<i>""JAM RUN is a gripping crime thriller about the ever-present menace and violence the LGBTQ communities face daily.</i>”  —Richard Burnett, Montreal journalist, and Fugues Magazine columnist.</h3><p> </p><h2><b><u>An Excerpt</u></b></h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Jam Run</strong></h2><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">An Eddie Barrow Mystery</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Chapter 1</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>Citrusville Bar, Pegga Road, Irwin, Jamaica.</i></p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie Barrow thrust his Jamaican five-hundred-dollar bill across the counter to the bartender before the other patron could utter a syllable. There was no way in hell Eddie was going to let someone else cut in front of him tonight.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">This time it was a wire-thin <i>sista</i>, dressed in a crop-top, Harley Quinn shorts, and a Mary J Blige weave. To him, she looked like she must be thinking, “He ain’t much of a man,” but Eddie couldn’t give a rat’s ass what she thought. He may not have been born in Barbados like his parents, but he knew the rules of the Caribbean—that cut-ins were a way of life down here.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">At five foot eight and a little over one hundred and seventy pounds, Barrow wasn’t the most physically imposing <i>brotha</i> around, but it didn’t mean that he didn’t know how to stand his ground when he needed to.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Two waters please,” Eddie yelled as he competed with the heavy bass in the background that shook his internal organs—keeping his hand on the five-hundred dollars.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The bartender leaned closer. “What you say?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“I said water.” He held up two fingers. “Two.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie loosened his grip on the bill as the bartender pulled it away and slipped it in the cash register. He reached below the counter, then placed two bottles in front of Eddie before moving on to the sista—the one who tried to undercut him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">With a bottle in each hand, Eddie navigated through the crowd. It was no different than trying to exit a packed subway car—especially getting elbowed and poked. He kept looking down, worried someone was going to step on his toes and dirty up his pristine pair of Air Max runners.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">This was exactly the reason Eddie outgrew the club scene a year after he came into it roughly seven years before. It didn’t take him long before he realized that he wasn’t missing anything. As for Corey Stephenson, his “brotha from another motha” from way back, clubbing and going out was more his thing. Eddie was the quiet one who always wanted to stay home with his head buried in a book or, up until recently, writing one to keep up with deadlines. If he went out, it was because Corey had dragged him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The funny thing was that Eddie had always been told that Barbadians—or Bajans—were the loudest, more so than Trinidadians. Corey was born in Trinidad and moved to Montreal when he was around eleven or twelve, not too long before he saved Eddie’s ass from a bunch of skinheads who’d ambushed him in the park. At a solid six-foot-two with his Trini charm, he was always able to talk his way into a woman’s panties, unlike Eddie.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">But he’d since settled down a bit—getting his girlfriend pregnant and then marrying her had changed Corey for the better. He’d once had an alcohol problem too. Those were moments that Eddie wanted to forget. One of those memories involved both of them and Corey’s then-girlfriend, Jordyn, being on the run from the police for a murder Eddie had been framed for.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie didn’t even wait to get back to Corey before he took a drink of his water to cool off in this sweltering Jamaican heat. Even though this section of the bar was outdoors, a bunch of brothas and sistas crowded together like sardines still made the mercury rise—especially since they weren’t close enough to the ocean to catch the breeze.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">They’d only arrived from Montreal earlier that afternoon. As expected, Corey had to drag Eddie out of the Airbnb to find the nearest party.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">It was their first time in Jamaica. It was business for Eddie. Pleasure for Corey. In less than twelve hours Eddie would be signing copies of his latest thriller, which was why he didn’t want to be out too late or drink anything alcoholic. Eddie was a lightweight. The last thing he needed was to be hungover during the book signing.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Come on, it’ll only be for a few hours. You’ll have plenty of time to sleep,” Corey had said earlier. Which had only made Eddie sigh. He didn’t have much of a track record in saying no to his friend.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">A sista caught Eddie’s attention, clearly not hiding the fact that she was eying him. The woman’s jet-black hair with blond highlights reached the top of her midnight dress—one which conveniently stopped just below her thighs. When she turned to the side it was as though the world moved in slow motion. Yeah, she wanted him to notice her—especially her peach-shaped booty. Eddie’s eyes then dropped to her feet, and he nodded in appreciation. A wicked pair of stilettos. This sista had polished herself literally from head to toe.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">He gazed around now. There must be at least a dozen brothas there, all ready to jump her bones.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie shook it off and found Corey—lost in his own world—doing the <i>Gully Creepa</i>. At least the crowd wasn’t as dense, and the air was less tainted by the smell of sweat and perfume. He held out Corey’s water bottle.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Corey,” yelled Eddie, but his friend didn’t seem to notice.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie tapped the bottle on Corey’s shoulder, catching his attention.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“There you are.” Corey took the bottle and unscrewed the cap. “What took you so long?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Don’t ask.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Corey drank a bit and then nodded past Eddie. “You notice that girl staring at you?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">What a question to ask. How could he not? Eddie had always been the more observant of the two. He finished off his water in a single swig, giving Corey what Eddie hoped was a nonchalant shrug. “Yeah, I saw her.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Why don’t you go talk to her?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Oh sure, so that I look desperate.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“<i>Bwoy</i>, stop being a pussy and go talk to her.” Corey shook his head and took a swig.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie watched as three brothas—two of them solidly built—approached the sista. They weren’t holding back, and one of the three reached under her skirt from behind. But she had already spotted them, anticipated his move, and slapped his hand away before striding off.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The brotha laughed as he casually ran his hand over the top of his du-rag. The other, who wore a bandana, bent over at the waist laughing as he held onto his friend’s shoulder. The third, who looked like the odd one of the three, bowed his head and looked away while covering his mouth. He, unlike the other two, didn’t fit the tough-guy, macho type. The fact is that he looked as though he was embarrassed by his friend’s behavior.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“You see that?” Eddie asked.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Corey nodded. “She’s waiting for you to make the first move.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie knew when Corey was right, and this was one of those times. People around him were up on each other, sistas whinin’ up on a brotha—bent over between six-fifteen and six-thirty—to music whose lyrics at times even degraded them.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie caught her smile as she ran two fingers across her brow to clear away the few strands of hair that fell over her eye. He approached her slowly, not letting go of her gaze. She gravitated toward him. The DJ suddenly cut off the music, screaming something in Jamaican Patois that Eddie couldn’t understand, right before a bombastic tune blasted around him. That was the moment when Eddie was caught off guard as she spun around and backed up into him—ass first—and performed the most energetic and wildest <i>Dutty Wine </i>he’d ever seen. She then followed through to <i>Bruk It Down.</i></p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>Damn, she has skills</i>.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">It was way more than Eddie could handle, and he struggled to keep up with her. She then turned around and looked into his eyes—their noses barely touching. He stared back, held her gaze, but something was off. It made him pause his dancing, a tiny voice in his head telling him to back up. But he was caught off guard when the sista grabbed him by the shoulders with a firm grip. Before he realized what was happening, she hoisted herself in the air and locked her legs around him just above the waist in a vicelike grip. Out of reflex, he quickly took a deep breath as he felt the pressure from her legs onto his ribcage.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The jump's momentum knocked him off balance, and he stumbled backward before falling—nearly striking his head on the ground.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The crowd went crazy, and all Eddie heard was howling laughter. For the next several seconds, the jarringly loud thumps of the bass from the speakers were reduced to background noise.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie felt as though a nasty prank had been pulled on him as the back of his throat dried up.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">But she wasn’t done with him yet. She continued gyrating onto him as though nothing had happened while he lay on his back. She then spun around to face the opposite way—with her ass literally up in his face as she shook it. All Eddie saw was booty and thong. He couldn’t help but watch—his neck hurt from holding his head up for so long. She then did a front roll into a handstand, held it, then gracefully let one leg fall after the next to form a bridge, and pulled herself up at the waist with seemingly little effort to stand on both feet.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie couldn’t hold his head up any longer and let it drop as he breathed deeply, attempting to process what the hell just happened. Even before he sat up, brothas inundated him as they rushed to give him high-fives. He was slow to return them, considering that he was still recovering from the ordeal.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">He couldn’t tell if the crowd was cheering or laughing. It sounded more like laughing—and at him. Twenty-seven years young, and he still felt like the odd one in the crowd. It reminded him of the times in elementary and high school gym class where he was always the last one chosen to be on a team.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The sista winked at him before turning to go. He felt the blood rushing to his groin as her ass bounced from side to side as she sashayed away.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Wait,” Eddie yelled as he scrambled to his feet, but she was already gone.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>Where did she go?</i></p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie heard Corey’s long, drawling holler as his friend grabbed his shoulder. “Yoooooooo! Did you get her number?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie turned to him and saw Corey wiping the tears away with his towel.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Naw, she took off too fast.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Corey shook his head. “Come again? You let her do all that, and you didn’t even get her number?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“I said she was gone before I could get up. By the way, I’m okay—considering that I nearly cracked the back of my head open.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“That ain’t no excuse. Bwoy, I oughta slap you upside the head.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">It was then that the DJ lowered the music and started yelling into the mic, announcing a dance-off, and that the participants should present themselves. Six army-vet-looking brothas, showing off their pecs by wearing tight black t-shirts with the word SECURITY emblazoned on the back, cleared a circle. As the area was being prepared, four young sistas—ranging from petite to thunder thighs—were already on the floor.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Corey beckoned Eddie to follow him quickly so that they could get a closer view. There was only one row of people in front, forcing Eddie to look between to see, while Corey—being the taller one—only inconvenienced the ones behind him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">It took just a few moments before Eddie spotted her again. She was on the opposite side of the circle, talking to another sista. It appeared that she was complimenting her on her dress. The woman then took out her smartphone, and they snapped a selfie. The smile was so irresistible. But something was still off, and a red flag was flapping in his mind. If only he knew why. The other sista, whom she took the selfie with, ran into the circle as the DJ blasted the music again.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie tapped Corey’s arm. “I’ll be back.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“You leave, and you’re going to lose your spot.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie then nodded in the direction of the woman. “It’ll be worth it.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">When Corey looked away, Eddie saw what appeared to be a scuffle. He nearly pushed aside the person in front of him to get a better view. It was the woman. She was trying to leave, but some brothas and sistas were blocking her path.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">A few seconds later, though, it appeared that they were persuading her to join the dance-off. It came to the point where the woman was literally pushed into the circle—where the other sistas already had a head start.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The look on her face, she was worried. It was as though she didn’t want to do it or even be there anymore. But the crowd was not forgiving. One of the bouncers who helped clear the area came to her and said something into her ear. It was at that moment that she removed a stiletto.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Bedlam.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie thought he would go deaf from the amount of screaming that erupted around him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The second stiletto came off, and she handed those, along with her purse, to the bouncer. She relaxed, and her smile came back. It was contagious enough that it even made Eddie smile. After she started to move, he knew that the contest was already over after the first twenty seconds. It was evident by the amount of noise the crowd made that she was the winner. Two of the other competitors seemed to know they didn’t stand a chance of winning, and they gave up and bolted in a New York Minute. She clearly had more energy and endurance than the remaining competitors. However, it was the backflip ending in a ground splits that sealed the deal for her.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Game over.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The music came to an abrupt stop, and the DJ called out the names of the remaining contestants one at a time to let the amount of noise the crowd made determine the winner. He came last to the woman Eddie had danced with. The DJ had to ask for her name.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>She must be new. How else would the DJ know the others and not her? </i>Eddie thought.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The woman was handed her belongings along with a cordless mic. She then turned to the DJ. “My name’s Shenice.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Chaos.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie was bounced from both sides and from behind as everyone around him completely lost it—jumping up and down, swinging towels, obviously not caring who they knocked into. It was soon after that the DJ announced her as the winner.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“You better get her number. That’s wifey material,” Corey shouted into Eddie’s ear. Eddie didn’t answer. As blown away as he was, he still couldn’t help but feel that there was something off about Shenice.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">As she slid her feet back into her stilettos, a brotha walked to Shenice and handed her an ultra-wide gold-colored column trophy and an envelope. Eddie assumed the latter was either a cash prize or a gift card.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Thunder-thighs and the selfie-sista both gave Shenice congratulatory hugs while the other two women scowled and stormed off.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie forced his way past the people in front of him, but others crowded back inside the circle, creating enough obstacles to slow him down. When he got to where Shenice was, she was gone again.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>Shit, man!</i></p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">He jumped in the air a few times, hoping to see her above the crowd. The sixth time he spotted the blond highlights at the back of her head.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Shenice,” Eddie yelled, only for his voice to be lost among the dozens. He went to the spot where he last saw her and found himself next to a line to the ladies' room.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>A line this long, she couldn’t have gotten in so quickly. </i>“Excuse me. Anyone see Shenice?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Who yuh call Shenice? Which Shenice is dat?” answered one woman in a heavy Jamaican accent.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“She just won.” All Eddie saw were shaking heads.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Me no see yar pass tru.” Eddie assumed she said: <i>I didn’t see her pass through here.</i></p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>How does Shenice keep going ninja on me? </i>He went back and found Corey waiting where he had left him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“And?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie furrowed a brow and shook his head. He tugged at his own collar. “I’m going out to the parking lot for a bit. It’s too stuffy here.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The sound of tiny gravel crunching under his feet was a relief from the jarring bass from the subwoofers. As he walked between two rows of cars, all he saw were Toyotas, Mitsubishis, and Hondas—not an American or European car in sight. The ringing in his ears wasn’t as bad as he had expected.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">His phone buzzed in his front pants pocket. He grabbed it and saw the envelope icon indicating that he had received a text message. Eddie held his thumb on the monitor in the fingerprint display to unlock it. The message was from Corey, asking if he’d found Shenice.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie replied with a “No.” A few seconds later, the phone buzzed again. He checked it out, expecting to see Corey’s answer. Instead, he saw that his text didn’t go through. It bounced back, accompanied by a red exclamation mark. <i>Damn</i>. A slashed zero replaced the phone signal bars and the Wi-Fi icon at the top of the screen.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">No signal.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie stopped and walked backward a few steps while raising the phone above him to catch the signal. Still nothing.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">That was odd.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie slid the phone back into his pocket. He tapped the other pocket and still felt the thin pouch—the third time he’d done so this evening. The pouch was too obscure to be visible to a would-be pickpocket but large enough to just hold his ID and a few dollar bills. No sense in him checking it too often, or he’d tip off someone that he had something of value on him. As for his wallet, he’d left it in the glove compartment of his car.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">His thoughts drifted back to Shenice. <i>What kind of sista whine-up on a man so and don’t even talk to him after?</i> But she was gone. Either she caught a taxi, was picked up by a friend, or she drove herself. Who knew? Again, the thought came back to him that there was something about her that was unusual. It was killing him that he couldn’t figure out what it was.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie was startled by shouting that came from several cars away, and he turned to see what appeared to be fighting among three people. Two brothas held onto a sista by the arms and threw her face down onto the hood of a car. Eddie’s walk turned into a jog so that he could get a better view. That’s when he saw that it was Du-Rag and Bandana. Eddie couldn’t see the sista’s face but caught a glimpse of the back of her head and saw the blond highlights, sending his heartbeat into overdrive.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>Holy shit, they’re going to rape Shenice.</i></p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Hey!” Eddie yelled, catching the attention of Shenice’s attackers. “Leave her—”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The cuff to the back of his head sent a shock that penetrated Eddie’s brain. The world spun around him, seconds before he fell forward, striking another solid object before he hit the ground. He scrunched up his face as he forced his eyes shut, crying out from the sudden shock of pain. But he only heard his cries internally. Something—no, <i>someone</i> was forcing down hard on his mouth with what felt like a damp cloth with a noxious-smelling chemical. Whatever it was, he had already inhaled too much of it that he was left disoriented.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">He felt the crook of an arm under his chin, pulling him backward. His body fell limp as his heels dragged across the ground. He didn’t even have the strength to turn his head to see his attacker before his eyes got very heavy.</p><p align=""center"" style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">***</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The choking startled Eddie awake as he rolled on his side, only to inhale a mouthful of dust, making things worst. He got onto all fours as he tried to take deep breaths in between violent coughs. He turned around and into a seated position with his back to one of the cars beside him. The right side of his forehead throbbed. He put a hand to it. Things started to come back to him. He had bumped his head. And right before that, he was hit from behind. And that was right before…</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>Shenice.</i></p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Standing was a struggle, but he held onto the car next to him for support. Once up, he heard the banging cacophony coming from the bar. He let go of the car to see if he could walk on his own but ended up stumbling forward. Eddie braced himself on the car again to stop himself from falling.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">He did his best to maintain his footing as he headed to where he had seen Shenice being attacked.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Shenice?” Eddie yelled. Nothing but the slow-jamming reggae in the background. He grabbed his cell and called Corey, and held the phone to his ear as he searched the area.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;""><i>Come on, pick-up. </i>It suddenly hit him that the phone signal was down earlier. Eddie took a quick glance at the screen and still saw the slashed zero.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The loud sliding of tires on dirt and gravel startled him—freezing him where he stood as the shock took over, preventing him from jumping out of the way of the oncoming vehicle. The car still slid but luckily came to a stop—within inches of striking him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie’s nerves unlocked, allowing him to breathe again.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">With the headlights shining below his waist, he was able to see the visible BMW insignia on the hood of the car and who was inside. Bandana was in the passenger seat, but there was something wrong with his eyes. He was clearly in pain as he was rubbing them with his hands while howling. The driver was one of his friends, the odd one of the group. He then saw Du-Rag in the backseat, staring between both of them and straight at Eddie.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Delroy, Laawd Jesus! How yuhh slam pun de breaks so? Why nuh kill me?” yelled Bandana.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“It’s dat <i>bloodclaat</i> who shout at us,” said Du-Rag. “Move out at de road, yuh damn idiat. <i>Bombaklaat</i>!”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The driver wasn’t among the two who attacked Shenice. At least, Eddie didn’t remember him being there. But the fear was all over his face. When his hand slammed on the horn, it startled Eddie enough that he jumped to the side.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie raised his hands in surrender. “Yo, my bad.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The accelerator was floored, causing the tires to spin wildly, gravel ricocheting out behind the car. As they passed, Eddie saw Du-Rag point at him while imitating a gun. He then lowered his thumb to touch his index as though he was pulling the trigger. This was done slowly, and Eddie knew that Du-Rag was making a point.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie shielded his eyes with his forearm as a dust cloud emerged from under the spinning tires. The tiny pebbles became projectiles, stinging his arms and legs as the car cut left, causing it to fishtail. It then sped off and exited the parking lot. Once it hit the road, Eddie heard the screeching of tires and the accelerating roar of the engine.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Even though it was impossible to catch the license plate number, he already had two clues: the driver’s name was Delroy, and he drove a BMW—the only European car he saw in this lot so far.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Ed.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie turned to see Corey running toward him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“I was looking all over for you.” Corey slid to a stop, a bit out of breath. “Didn’t you get my text?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">It didn’t take long for his best friend to notice his injury.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Bruh, what happened to your head?” Corey reached out to touch the bruise.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie moved his head to dodge his hand. “That’s nothing.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“What happened to you?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie continued searching for Shenice. “I wish I knew.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“What?” Corey put his hand on Eddie’s shoulder to get his attention. “Were you fighting? Who did this to you?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Shenice.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Corey tilted his head. “<i>Shenice</i> did that to you?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“No, she was being attacked,” Eddie answered. “It was those same guys we saw earlier.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“They did this to you?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie began to wander off. “No, not them.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Corey moved quickly to catch up to him. “You ain’t making any sense.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“We have to find her.” Eddie picked up the pace—looking both left and right. “I think they raped her.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“You serious? Where?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Over there, I think.” Eddie pointed to the spot where he last remembered seeing her. “I saw Du-Rag and Bandana dragging her, and I yelled at them. Then someone jumped me from behind. That’s when I fell and hit my head. I tried texting you, but the phone signal’s out.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“I know,” said Corey. “When you didn’t reply, I texted you again, but it bounced back. So I came out here looking for you.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">An object on the ground caught Eddie’s attention. It was a shoe, more specifically a stiletto—and it looked like one that Shenice had been wearing. Eddie darted right for it and picked it up. The heel was broken and dangled from its attachment like a shoelace. He showed it to Corey, who raised his eyebrows.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Shenice could’ve been running for her life.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">They both frantically searched, looking underneath the cars in anticipation that she was on the ground, all while yelling her name.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">A loud, frightening scream came from the entrance to the parking lot. Eddie jumped to his feet, and his mouth dropped in a gasp. A human torch ran blindly in zigzags and circles with both arms flailing. The person fell but continued to kick and thrash on the ground, screaming as the bright flames seared through fabric to flesh.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie rushed to the victim while pulling off his shirt, then swung it as hard and fast as he could to beat out the flames. He didn’t care that his hands were getting singed. This person’s life was at stake. Moments later, he noticed that Corey was doing the same. Both of them yelled for help as they lashed the victim and furiously kicked dust and gravel from the ground to help smother the flames.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie’s shirt caught fire, forcing him to throw it on the ground. He grabbed his phone and dialed 911 while kicking as much dust as he could onto the victim. Still, the call wouldn’t go through. This doesn’t make sense. Emergency calls always worked, whether there was a phone signal or not.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">But Eddie’s gut told him they were already too late. It was the first time that Eddie smelled burning human flesh, and it brought on a brief wave of nausea. He still didn’t stop kicking gravel onto the victim even though the flames had died down.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Hey, do you hear me?” Eddie yelled.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">No reply.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Please answer. Can you hear me? Please say something.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Ed,” said Corey.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Come on,” Eddie’s voice died down. “Say something.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned to see Corey shaking his head.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Help, somebody help.” Gritting his teeth, he ran toward the bar. He continued yelling for help, but it was as though no one heard him.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie turned and ran back. “Did they say anything?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Corey sighed and shook his head.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie dropped to his knees in front of the victim and noticed they were missing their shoes. He then saw what remained of the dress. No long hair with gold highlights, which was most likely a weave that had completely burned away. It was definitely Shenice.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Fuck!” Corey yelled as he stomped on the ground.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie often read about Jamaica’s high homicide rate. He just never imagined that he would witness one within the first ten hours of his arrival. He didn’t know what had suddenly come over him as he stared at the smoking, charred body. Was it fear, shock, or both?</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">It wasn’t long before one of the patrons noticed what had happened. It began with one, then quickly became a few. Word spread quickly, and others began showing up. As expected, cell phones were up as the mob suddenly became the paparazzi. They practically smothered him, Corey, and Shenice.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Who dead?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Who do it?”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">“Move outta de way. Put it pun Facebook.”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The last comment pissed him the fuck off. Eddie jumped up and spun in the direction of the person who said it. “Who said they’re putting this on Facebook? Don’t you have any respect? Jesus!”</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">The crowd went silent for a moment, then they resumed what they were doing as though they hadn’t been interrupted.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">Eddie turned to look back at Shenice’s body. Most of the burns were from the neck down.</p><p style=""margin-left:14.2pt;"">There was enough light from the flashlights on the patrons’ cell phones that allowed Eddie to noticed that Shenice had suffered a skull-fracturing blow to the side of her head—maybe from a rock or a bat.

There was no way in hell Eddie was going to let someone else cut in front of him tonight.This time it was a wire-thin sista, dressed in a crop-top, Harley Quinn shorts, and a Mary J Blige weave. To him, she looked like she must be thinking, “He ain’t much of a man,” but Eddie couldn’t give a rat’s ass what she thought. He may not have been born in Barbados like his parents, but he knew the rules of the Caribbean—that cut-ins were a way of life down here.At five foot eight and a little over one hundred and seventy pounds, Barrow wasn’t the most physically imposing brotha around, but it didn’t mean that he didn’t know how to stand his ground when he needed to.“Two waters please,” Eddie yelled as he competed with the heavy bass in the background that shook his internal organs—keeping his hand on the five-hundred dollars.The bartender leaned closer. “What you say?”“I said water.” He held up two fingers. “Two.”Eddie loosened his grip on the bill as the bartender pulled it away and slipped it in the cash register. He reached below the counter, then placed two bottles in front of Eddie before moving on to the sista—the one who tried to undercut him.With a bottle in each hand, Eddie navigated through the crowd. It was no different than trying to exit a packed subway car—especially getting elbowed and poked. He kept looking down, worried someone was going to step on his toes and dirty up his pristine pair of Air Max runners.This was exactly the reason Eddie outgrew the club scene a year after he came into it roughly seven years before. It didn’t take him long before he realized that he wasn’t missing anything. As for Corey Stephenson, his “brotha from another motha” from way back, clubbing and going out was more his thing. Eddie was the quiet one who always wanted to stay home with his head buried in a book or, up until recently, writing one to keep up with deadlines. If he went out, it was because Corey had dragged him.The funny thing was that Eddie had always been told that Barbadians—or Bajans—were the loudest, more so than Trinidadians. Corey was born in Trinidad and moved to Montreal when he was around eleven or twelve, not too long before he saved Eddie’s ass from a bunch of skinheads who’d ambushed him in the park. At a solid six-foot-two with his Trini charm, he was always able to talk his way into a woman’s panties, unlike Eddie.But he’d since settled down a bit—getting his girlfriend pregnant and then marrying her had changed Corey for the better. He’d once had an alcohol problem too. Those were moments that Eddie wanted to forget. One of those memories involved both of them and Corey’s then-girlfriend, Jordyn, being on the run from the police for a murder Eddie had been framed for.Eddie didn’t even wait to get back to Corey before he took a drink of his water to cool off in this sweltering Jamaican heat. Even though this section of the bar was outdoors, a bunch of brothas and sistas crowded together like sardines still made the mercury rise—especially since they weren’t close enough to the ocean to catch the breeze.They’d only arrived from Montreal earlier that afternoon. As expected, Corey had to drag Eddie out of the Airbnb to find the nearest party.It was their first time in Jamaica. It was business for Eddie. Pleasure for Corey. In less than twelve hours Eddie would be signing copies of his latest thriller, which was why he didn’t want to be out too late or drink anything alcoholic. Eddie was a lightweight. The last thing he needed was to be hungover during the book signing.“Come on, it’ll only be for a few hours. You’ll have plenty of time to sleep,” Corey had said earlier. Which had only made Eddie sigh. He didn’t have much of a track record in saying no to his friend.A sista caught Eddie’s attention, clearly not hiding the fact that she was eying him. The woman’s jet-black hair with blond highlights reached the top of her midnight dress—one which conveniently stopped just below her thighs. When she turned to the side it was as though the world moved in slow motion. Yeah, she wanted him to notice her—especially her peach-shaped booty. Eddie’s eyes then dropped to her feet, and he nodded in appreciation. A wicked pair of stilettos. This sista had polished herself literally from head to toe.He gazed around now. There must be at least a dozen brothas there, all ready to jump her bones.Eddie shook it off and found Corey—lost in his own world—doing the Gully Creepa. At least the crowd wasn’t as dense, and the air was less tainted by the smell of sweat and perfume. He held out Corey’s water bottle.“Corey,” yelled Eddie, but his friend didn’t seem to notice.Eddie tapped the bottle on Corey’s shoulder, catching his attention.“There you are.” Corey took the bottle and unscrewed the cap. “What took you so long?”“Don’t ask.”Corey drank a bit and then nodded past Eddie. “You notice that girl staring at you?”What a question to ask. How could he not? Eddie had always been the more observant of the two. He finished off his water in a single swig, giving Corey what Eddie hoped was a nonchalant shrug. “Yeah, I saw her.”“Why don’t you go talk to her?”“Oh sure, so that I look desperate.”“Bwoy, stop being a pussy and go talk to her.” Corey shook his head and took a swig.Eddie watched as three brothas—two of them solidly built—approached the sista. They weren’t holding back, and one of the three reached under her skirt from behind. But she had already spotted them, anticipated his move, and slapped his hand away before striding off.The brotha laughed as he casually ran his hand over the top of his du-rag. The other, who wore a bandana, bent over at the waist laughing as he held onto his friend’s shoulder. The third, who looked like the odd one of the three, bowed his head and looked away while covering his mouth. He, unlike the other two, didn’t fit the tough-guy, macho type. The fact is that he looked as though he was embarrassed by his friend’s behavior.“You see that?” Eddie asked.Corey nodded. “She’s waiting for you to make the first move.”Eddie knew when Corey was right, and this was one of those times. People around him were up on each other, sistas whinin’ up on a brotha—bent over between six-fifteen and six-thirty—to music whose lyrics at times even degraded them.Eddie caught her smile as she ran two fingers across her brow to clear away the few strands of hair that fell over her eye. He approached her slowly, not letting go of her gaze. She gravitated toward him. The DJ suddenly cut off the music, screaming something in Jamaican Patois that Eddie couldn’t understand, right before a bombastic tune blasted around him. That was the moment when Eddie was caught off guard as she spun around and backed up into him—ass first—and performed the most energetic and wildest Dutty Wine he’d ever seen. She then followed through to Bruk It Down.Damn, she has skills.It was way more than Eddie could handle, and he struggled to keep up with her. She then turned around and looked into his eyes—their noses barely touching. He stared back, held her gaze, but something was off. It made him pause his dancing, a tiny voice in his head telling him to back up. But he was caught off guard when the sista grabbed him by the shoulders with a firm grip. Before he realized what was happening, she hoisted herself in the air and locked her legs around him just above the waist in a vicelike grip. Out of reflex, he quickly took a deep breath as he felt the pressure from her legs onto his ribcage.The jump's momentum knocked him off balance, and he stumbled backward before falling—nearly striking his head on the ground.The crowd went crazy, and all Eddie heard was howling laughter. For the next several seconds, the jarringly loud thumps of the bass from the speakers were reduced to background noise.Eddie felt as though a nasty prank had been pulled on him as the back of his throat dried up.But she wasn’t done with him yet. She continued gyrating onto him as though nothing had happened while he lay on his back. She then spun around to face the opposite way—with her ass literally up in his face as she shook it. All Eddie saw was booty and thong. He couldn’t help but watch—his neck hurt from holding his head up for so long. She then did a front roll into a handstand, held it, then gracefully let one leg fall after the next to form a bridge, and pulled herself up at the waist with seemingly little effort to stand on both feet.Eddie couldn’t hold his head up any longer and let it drop as he breathed deeply, attempting to process what the hell just happened. Even before he sat up, brothas inundated him as they rushed to give him high-fives. He was slow to return them, considering that he was still recovering from the ordeal.He couldn’t tell if the crowd was cheering or laughing. It sounded more like laughing—and at him. Twenty-seven years young, and he still felt like the odd one in the crowd. It reminded him of the times in elementary and high school gym class where he was always the last one chosen to be on a team.The sista winked at him before turning to go. He felt the blood rushing to his groin as her ass bounced from side to side as she sashayed away.“Wait,” Eddie yelled as he scrambled to his feet, but she was already gone.Where did she go?Eddie heard Corey’s long, drawling holler as his friend grabbed his shoulder. “Yoooooooo! Did you get her number?”Eddie turned to him and saw Corey wiping the tears away with his towel.“Naw, she took off too fast.”Corey shook his head. “Come again? You let her do all that, and you didn’t even get her number?”“I said she was gone before I could get up. By the way, I’m okay—considering that I nearly cracked the back of my head open.”“That ain’t no excuse. Bwoy, I oughta slap you upside the head.”It was then that the DJ lowered the music and started yelling into the mic, announcing a dance-off, and that the participants should present themselves. Six army-vet-looking brothas, showing off their pecs by wearing tight black t-shirts with the word SECURITY emblazoned on the back, cleared a circle. As the area was being prepared, four young sistas—ranging from petite to thunder thighs—were already on the floor.Corey beckoned Eddie to follow him quickly so that they could get a closer view. There was only one row of people in front, forcing Eddie to look between to see, while Corey—being the taller one—only inconvenienced the ones behind him.It took just a few moments before Eddie spotted her again. She was on the opposite side of the circle, talking to another sista. It appeared that she was complimenting her on her dress. The woman then took out her smartphone, and they snapped a selfie. The smile was so irresistible. But something was still off, and a red flag was flapping in his mind. If only he knew why. The other sista, whom she took the selfie with, ran into the circle as the DJ blasted the music again.Eddie tapped Corey’s arm. “I’ll be back.”“You leave, and you’re going to lose your spot.”Eddie then nodded in the direction of the woman. “It’ll be worth it.”When Corey looked away, Eddie saw what appeared to be a scuffle. He nearly pushed aside the person in front of him to get a better view. It was the woman. She was trying to leave, but some brothas and sistas were blocking her path.A few seconds later, though, it appeared that they were persuading her to join the dance-off. It came to the point where the woman was literally pushed into the circle—where the other sistas already had a head start.The look on her face, she was worried. It was as though she didn’t want to do it or even be there anymore. But the crowd was not forgiving. One of the bouncers who helped clear the area came to her and said something into her ear. It was at that moment that she removed a stiletto.Bedlam.Eddie thought he would go deaf from the amount of screaming that erupted around him.The second stiletto came off, and she handed those, along with her purse, to the bouncer. She relaxed, and her smile came back. It was contagious enough that it even made Eddie smile. After she started to move, he knew that the contest was already over after the first twenty seconds. It was evident by the amount of noise the crowd made that she was the winner. Two of the other competitors seemed to know they didn’t stand a chance of winning, and they gave up and bolted in a New York Minute. She clearly had more energy and endurance than the remaining competitors. However, it was the backflip ending in a ground splits that sealed the deal for her.Game over.The music came to an abrupt stop, and the DJ called out the names of the remaining contestants one at a time to let the amount of noise the crowd made determine the winner. He came last to the woman Eddie had danced with. The DJ had to ask for her name.She must be new. How else would the DJ know the others and not her? Eddie thought.The woman was handed her belongings along with a cordless mic. She then turned to the DJ. “My name’s Shenice.”Chaos.Eddie was bounced from both sides and from behind as everyone around him completely lost it—jumping up and down, swinging towels, obviously not caring who they knocked into. It was soon after that the DJ announced her as the winner.“You better get her number. That’s wifey material,” Corey shouted into Eddie’s ear. Eddie didn’t answer. As blown away as he was, he still couldn’t help but feel that there was something off about Shenice.As she slid her feet back into her stilettos, a brotha walked to Shenice and handed her an ultra-wide gold-colored column trophy and an envelope. Eddie assumed the latter was either a cash prize or a gift card.Thunder-thighs and the selfie-sista both gave Shenice congratulatory hugs while the other two women scowled and stormed off.Eddie forced his way past the people in front of him, but others crowded back inside the circle, creating enough obstacles to slow him down. When he got to where Shenice was, she was gone again.Shit, man!He jumped in the air a few times, hoping to see her above the crowd. The sixth time he spotted the blond highlights at the back of her head.“Shenice,” Eddie yelled, only for his voice to be lost among the dozens. He went to the spot where he last saw her and found himself next to a line to the ladies' room.A line this long, she couldn’t have gotten in so quickly. “Excuse me. Anyone see Shenice?”“Who yuh call Shenice? Which Shenice is dat?” answered one woman in a heavy Jamaican accent.“She just won.” All Eddie saw were shaking heads.“Me no see yar pass tru.” Eddie assumed she said: I didn’t see her pass through here.How does Shenice keep going ninja on me? He went back and found Corey waiting where he had left him.“And?”Eddie furrowed a brow and shook his head. He tugged at his own collar. “I’m going out to the parking lot for a bit. It’s too stuffy here.”The sound of tiny gravel crunching under his feet was a relief from the jarring bass from the subwoofers. As he walked between two rows of cars, all he saw were Toyotas, Mitsubishis, and Hondas—not an American or European car in sight. The ringing in his ears wasn’t as bad as he had expected.His phone buzzed in his front pants pocket. He grabbed it and saw the envelope icon indicating that he had received a text message. Eddie held his thumb on the monitor in the fingerprint display to unlock it. The message was from Corey, asking if he’d found Shenice.Eddie replied with a “No.” A few seconds later, the phone buzzed again. He checked it out, expecting to see Corey’s answer. Instead, he saw that his text didn’t go through. It bounced back, accompanied by a red exclamation mark. Damn. A slashed zero replaced the phone signal bars and the Wi-Fi icon at the top of the screen.No signal.Eddie stopped and walked backward a few steps while raising the phone above him to catch the signal. Still nothing.That was odd.Eddie slid the phone back into his pocket. He tapped the other pocket and still felt the thin pouch—the third time he’d done so this evening. The pouch was too obscure to be visible to a would-be pickpocket but large enough to just hold his ID and a few dollar bills. No sense in him checking it too often, or he’d tip off someone that he had something of value on him. As for his wallet, he’d left it in the glove compartment of his car.His thoughts drifted back to Shenice. What kind of sista whine-up on a man so and don’t even talk to him after? But she was gone. Either she caught a taxi, was picked up by a friend, or she drove herself. Who knew? Again, the thought came back to him that there was something about her that was unusual. It was killing him that he couldn’t figure out what it was.Eddie was startled by shouting that came from several cars away, and he turned to see what appeared to be fighting among three people. Two brothas held onto a sista by the arms and threw her face down onto the hood of a car. Eddie’s walk turned into a jog so that he could get a better view. That’s when he saw that it was Du-Rag and Bandana. Eddie couldn’t see the sista’s face but caught a glimpse of the back of her head and saw the blond highlights, sending his heartbeat into overdrive.Holy shit, they’re going to rape Shenice.“Hey!” Eddie yelled, catching the attention of Shenice’s attackers. “Leave her—”The cuff to the back of his head sent a shock that penetrated Eddie’s brain. The world spun around him, seconds before he fell forward, striking another solid object before he hit the ground. He scrunched up his face as he forced his eyes shut, crying out from the sudden shock of pain. But he only heard his cries internally. Something—no, someone was forcing down hard on his mouth with what felt like a damp cloth with a noxious-smelling chemical. Whatever it was, he had already inhaled too much of it that he was left disoriented.He felt the crook of an arm under his chin, pulling him backward. His body fell limp as his heels dragged across the ground. He didn’t even have the strength to turn his head to see his attacker before his eyes got very heavy.***The choking startled Eddie awake as he rolled on his side, only to inhale a mouthful of dust, making things worst. He got onto all fours as he tried to take deep breaths in between violent coughs. He turned around and into a seated position with his back to one of the cars beside him. The right side of his forehead throbbed. He put a hand to it. Things started to come back to him. He had bumped his head. And right before that, he was hit from behind. And that was right before…Shenice.Standing was a struggle, but he held onto the car next to him for support. Once up, he heard the banging cacophony coming from the bar. He let go of the car to see if he could walk on his own but ended up stumbling forward. Eddie braced himself on the car again to stop himself from falling.He did his best to maintain his footing as he headed to where he had seen Shenice being attacked.“Shenice?” Eddie yelled. Nothing but the slow-jamming reggae in the background. He grabbed his cell and called Corey, and held the phone to his ear as he searched the area.Come on, pick-up. It suddenly hit him that the phone signal was down earlier. Eddie took a quick glance at the screen and still saw the slashed zero.The loud sliding of tires on dirt and gravel startled him—freezing him where he stood as the shock took over, preventing him from jumping out of the way of the oncoming vehicle. The car still slid but luckily came to a stop—within inches of striking him.Eddie’s nerves unlocked, allowing him to breathe again.With the headlights shining below his waist, he was able to see the visible BMW insignia on the hood of the car and who was inside. Bandana was in the passenger seat, but there was something wrong with his eyes. He was clearly in pain as he was rubbing them with his hands while howling. The driver was one of his friends, the odd one of the group. He then saw Du-Rag in the backseat, staring between both of them and straight at Eddie.“Delroy, Laawd Jesus! How yuhh slam pun de breaks so? Why nuh kill me?” yelled Bandana.“It’s dat bloodclaat who shout at us,” said Du-Rag. “Move out at de road, yuh damn idiat. Bombaklaat!”The driver wasn’t among the two who attacked Shenice. At least, Eddie didn’t remember him being there. But the fear was all over his face. When his hand slammed on the horn, it startled Eddie enough that he jumped to the side.Eddie raised his hands in surrender. “Yo, my bad.”The accelerator was floored, causing the tires to spin wildly, gravel ricocheting out behind the car. As they passed, Eddie saw Du-Rag point at him while imitating a gun. He then lowered his thumb to touch his index as though he was pulling the trigger. This was done slowly, and Eddie knew that Du-Rag was making a point.Eddie shielded his eyes with his forearm as a dust cloud emerged from under the spinning tires. The tiny pebbles became projectiles, stinging his arms and legs as the car cut left, causing it to fishtail. It then sped off and exited the parking lot. Once it hit the road, Eddie heard the screeching of tires and the accelerating roar of the engine.Even though it was impossible to catch the license plate number, he already had two clues: the driver’s name was Delroy, and he drove a BMW—the only European car he saw in this lot so far.“Ed.”Eddie turned to see Corey running toward him.“I was looking all over for you.” Corey slid to a stop, a bit out of breath. “Didn’t you get my text?”It didn’t take long for his best friend to notice his injury.“Bruh, what happened to your head?” Corey reached out to touch the bruise.Eddie moved his head to dodge his hand. “That’s nothing.”“What happened to you?”Eddie continued searching for Shenice. “I wish I knew.”“What?” Corey put his hand on Eddie’s shoulder to get his attention. “Were you fighting? Who did this to you?”“Shenice.”Corey tilted his head. “Shenice did that to you?”“No, she was being attacked,” Eddie answered. “It was those same guys we saw earlier.”“They did this to you?”Eddie began to wander off. “No, not them.”Corey moved quickly to catch up to him. “You ain’t making any sense.”“We have to find her.” Eddie picked up the pace—looking both left and right. “I think they raped her.”“You serious? Where?”“Over there, I think.” Eddie pointed to the spot where he last remembered seeing her. “I saw Du-Rag and Bandana dragging her, and I yelled at them. Then someone jumped me from behind. That’s when I fell and hit my head. I tried texting you, but the phone signal’s out.”“I know,” said Corey. “When you didn’t reply, I texted you again, but it bounced back. So I came out here looking for you.”An object on the ground caught Eddie’s attention. It was a shoe, more specifically a stiletto—and it looked like one that Shenice had been wearing. Eddie darted right for it and picked it up. The heel was broken and dangled from its attachment like a shoelace. He showed it to Corey, who raised his eyebrows.Shenice could’ve been running for her life.They both frantically searched, looking underneath the cars in anticipation that she was on the ground, all while yelling her name.A loud, frightening scream came from the entrance to the parking lot. Eddie jumped to his feet, and his mouth dropped in a gasp. A human torch ran blindly in zigzags and circles with both arms flailing. The person fell but continued to kick and thrash on the ground, screaming as the bright flames seared through fabric to flesh.Eddie rushed to the victim while pulling off his shirt, then swung it as hard and fast as he could to beat out the flames. He didn’t care that his hands were getting singed. This person’s life was at stake. Moments later, he noticed that Corey was doing the same. Both of them yelled for help as they lashed the victim and furiously kicked dust and gravel from the ground to help smother the flames.Eddie’s shirt caught fire, forcing him to throw it on the ground. He grabbed his phone and dialed 911 while kicking as much dust as he could onto the victim. Still, the call wouldn’t go through. This doesn’t make sense. Emergency calls always worked, whether there was a phone signal or not.But Eddie’s gut told him they were already too late. It was the first time that Eddie smelled burning human flesh, and it brought on a brief wave of nausea. He still didn’t stop kicking gravel onto the victim even though the flames had died down.“Hey, do you hear me?” Eddie yelled.No reply.“Please answer. Can you hear me? Please say something.”“Ed,” said Corey.“Come on,” Eddie’s voice died down. “Say something.”Eddie felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned to see Corey shaking his head.“Help, somebody help.” Gritting his teeth, he ran toward the bar. He continued yelling for help, but it was as though no one heard him.Eddie turned and ran back. “Did they say anything?”Corey sighed and shook his head.Eddie dropped to his knees in front of the victim and noticed they were missing their shoes. He then saw what remained of the dress. No long hair with gold highlights, which was most likely a weave that had completely burned away. It was definitely Shenice.“Fuck!” Corey yelled as he stomped on the ground.Eddie often read about Jamaica’s high homicide rate. He just never imagined that he would witness one within the first ten hours of his arrival. He didn’t know what had suddenly come over him as he stared at the smoking, charred body. Was it fear, shock, or both?It wasn’t long before one of the patrons noticed what had happened. It began with one, then quickly became a few. Word spread quickly, and others began showing up. As expected, cell phones were up as the mob suddenly became the paparazzi. They practically smothered him, Corey, and Shenice.“Who dead?”“Who do it?”“Move outta de way. Put it pun Facebook.”The last comment pissed him the fuck off. Eddie jumped up and spun in the direction of the person who said it. “Who said they’re putting this on Facebook? Don’t you have any respect? Jesus!”The crowd went silent for a moment, then they resumed what they were doing as though they hadn’t been interrupted.Eddie turned to look back at Shenice’s body. Most of the burns were from the neck down.There was enough light from the flashlights on the patrons’ cell phones that allowed Eddie to noticed that Shenice had suffered a skull-fracturing blow to the side of her head—maybe from a rock or a bat. But something was still off, and he was reminded of the red flags that hit him earlier. Something about Shenice’s body caught Eddie’s attention. He took out his smartphone to activate the flashlight so that he could get a better look.What Eddie saw made him tense up while stifling a gasp. He quickly pointed the flashlight away from the victim.So that’s what was bothering me.“Clear outta de way!” Eddie heard a few brothas yelling. He turned to see that the crowd was being physically dispersed by the bouncers. They made it through, grabbing both Eddie and Corey, then shoving them back.“Bombaclaat!” yelled one of them as he turned his head away in disgust.Another pointed his finger toward Eddie and Corey. “A two a uno do it?”“We were trying to save her,” Corey answered. “We even lost our shirts trying to beat out the flames.”Eddie didn’t understand a word the bouncer said. But after Corey answered him, it was obvious that the bouncer asked: “You two did this?”The same bouncer eyed them while shaking his head.“If we did this, why would we hang around to get caught?” Eddie couldn’t believe that this idiot would have the gall to accuse them of killing Shenice.The bouncer then sighed and pointed to a spot away from the crowd. “Stay ova deh so, and no botha move!”Move over there, and don’t bother trying to leave! Eddie understood that part.Both Eddie and Corey obeyed and went to where they were instructed.“That’s some straight-up bullshit,” said Corey as they looked at the gathering. “Those guys not only raped her, but they killed her too. What kind of sick fucks do such a thing?”Eddie shook his head. “I have my suspicions, but I don’t think they raped Shenice. And if it’s possible, a medical examiner will confirm that.”Corey turned to Eddie and tilted his head. “I thought you said that those guys attacked her.”“Yeah, before someone jumped me.” Eddie turned to his friend. “I don’t know what happened while I was knocked out or how long I was out for.”It was then that Eddie saw two of the bouncers talking into their mobile phones.

He has written several pieces on Taiwan’s destruction of heritage and social issues for The Diplomat and The News Lens International.In 2015 he launched his first book, Primaryland: A Trip Through the 2012 New Hampshire Primary, available for Amazon Kindle.James X. Morris是一名台灣台北國立政治大學亞太研究所博士生。 三年以來，爲了撰寫論文，他在台灣、台灣海峽、香港和澳門的島嶼上研究墓園、墓葬和鄰里神社。James是一位博主/撰稿人，為The Diplomat 撰寫主要關注台灣社會問題的文章。 他為The Diplomat和The News Lens International 撰寫了幾篇關於台灣文化遺產的破壞和社會問題的文章。2015年，他推出了他的第一本書，Primaryland: A Trip Through the 2012 New Hampshire Primary，此書能在Amazon Kindle購買。 RISKS AND CHALLENGES / 風險和挑戰The fieldwork is complete, the research has been done, and a publishing house has been found. ""Grassroots Heritage"" is in the editing and layout phase. You can pledge with confidence. It has taken a little longer than expected to produce this project due to ongoing events in Xindian. As this is the second phase of fundraising, several lessons have been learned along the way. Mainly: writing a book takes longer than expected! Once the project is funded I anticipate materials and perks to be ready for supporters by the end of March 2019.田野調查已經完成，大部分研究已經完成，並且已經找到了出版社。 你可以放心地資助。預計完成日期：2019年3月底The first campaign/ 第一個活動： https://igg.me/at/qTF3z6BopyU/x/19348398",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>

I had never encountered someone who had done so much in one lifetime as Preston B. Plumb (1837-1891). I discovered his story while doing research for my master's thesis in 2012 and have wanted to research and write a biography on him of ever since.</p>
<p>From purchasing his first newspaper business as a teenager; smuggling weapons from Iowa to Kansas to support the abolitionist Free-State cause in his late teens; founding the city of Emporia, Kansas in 1857; serving on the Kansas State Constitutional Convention; fighting in the Civil War both in the Kansas and Missouri theater, as well as out west; operating a successful law firm; serving as president of the Emporia National Bank; serving in the Kansas State Legislature; and eventually serving 14 years as a United States Senator from Kansas.  His life was full of adventure, excitement, and politics, and makes for a fascinating read.</p>

<p>I have written and lectured on his military service for the past few years, and now I would like to complete my research on his entire life and write a compelling biography.  This campaign is important to me because this is a project that is something I've been working on for some time, and I am finally close enough that I can nearly begin writing.  This is where you come in!</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The last remaining research material that I need to digitize for this project is in Emporia, Kansas. I have already received grant funding to travel there previously, and this project is to help fund one last trip to obtain copies of the last archive material that I need.</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest expense in research is the travel, and that is exactly where this funding will go. Gas, food, and hotel rooms to Emporia. Beyond those expenses, any additional moneys will go towards image licensing for the book.</li>
<li>Every little bit helps, so even if I do not reach my entire goal, all funding will go towards a research trip to the archives in Emporia.</li>
<li>I will be publishing and printing this book myself, so that I can maintain control over its content, and will be offering both a paperback and linen hardcover version. Both available as perks for pre-order here!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>My current goal is to have published copies of this book in hand about 1 year from now, summer of 2022. This will allow me to travel to Emporia, Kansas this summer to obtain copies of the last of the research material I need. Then spend this fall and winter organizing my research and writing the book. Spring of 2022 will be set aside for proofing the book, layout and design.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For me, history has always been far more than just memorizing names and dates, history is really about the people themselves. It's about their stories. Stories that can inspire us, affect us, and encourage us to be the best that we can be.  Reading true stories of men and women who have overcome tremendous obstacles and achieved success is something that we should all find interest in.  Shedding new light on these people who have been ""forgotten"" or ""lost"" to contemporary audiences is where the historian comes in.  I believe this book will be of value beyond just Kansas history, and I think that anyone who enjoys reading a good story will enjoy this.  This will not be a work of historical fiction, everything in it will be backed up by research, and my hope is that readers will find a lot to relate to in his story and find it both interesting and encouraging.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Projects such as this always have their share of challenges, but in this case, I am returning to a location I have been to twice before, and am well aware of the research materials available to me there. Often times, researchers can travel to archival repositories only to find that the material they are looking for isn't there.  This is the last research step before I can begin writing.</p>

We provided catering services to many civil society organisations to raise money for Diaspora Women’s Initiative (DWI) health retreats. I completely disassociated myself from everyone. I lost all the connections I had built over time. I lost faith in what I believed in. Again, this mirrors deteriorating mental health. It was so hard and so inhumane; reporting with kids to Immigration once every month. This meant the kids missed out school each time I had to report. I had been put on deportation order for three years of my life. On reaching Immigration, I had to go to Counter Number One.  I will never forget Counter Number One.  *Image of Juliet via Independent.ie, 28/11/2007 A little bit about Tallav Books:Tallav is a new creative company based between Dingle, Co.

<p>Hayden Keyes knows everything there is to know about knights, legends, and fantasy, but that obviously doesn't mean he has ever jousted, worn a suit of armor, or flown on the back of a dimension-traveling griffin.</p>
<p>In fact, Hayden's life is pretty average. Well, that is up for you to decide. Hayden never met his real parents, though his foster ones are great. Sure, they have a hoarding problem and an irrational fear of Halloween costumes, but nobody's life is perfect, right? All Hayden wants is to fit in. And be the star of his middle school's basketball team. That would be nice.</p>
<p>But Hayden's life is about to turn all kinds of crazy. When a pumpkin-headed knight and a pair of hungry trolls posing as eighth graders show up at school, suddenly Hayden finds himself holding a one-way ticket to uncovering the mysteries of his past, facing a monstrously dangerous destiny, and the chance to return to his true home . . . BETWEEN, land of New Camelot, the Knights of the Round Table, and a world of magic Hayden never dreamed existed.</p>

<p>Journalism is important and its defunding, which actually takes place at grassroots level, stifles and disrupts free speech and the public access to alternative and often vital news. Have you heard about Dana Rivers? Most of you reading this haven’t. Yet women have been asking why this story has gone ignored by major and independent media. You are directly affected by this because if you are only hearing one message from large organisations with an agenda, you will not be aware of alternative viewpoints or stories that have been buried by propaganda. You will be uninformed. Supporting grass roots journalism ensures that a variety of views can be expressed, considered and evaluated. That is the basis of a free speech democracy which you and the generations to come need to thrive.</p>
<h3>Background to Launching ""Disappearing Acts""</h3>
<p>I am Julian Vigo, an anthropologist, writer, filmmaker and editor of <i><a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Savage Minds</a></i>. I came into journalism after a career in academia. In 2010 I left academia and went to Haiti to conduct an ethnographic-journalistic project on child trafficking to include an analysis of the problems within the NGO and UN model which professionalised older colonial ideologies and professions, shifting them from “viceroy” to “humanitarian worker.” Meanwhile, these humanitarian disasters were pretty much all manmade with human trafficking being as much a byproduct of ""humanitarian work"" as much it was a product of its orbiting politics and not a coincidental manifestation. Still, there was no media coverage critical of the NGO and UN presence very much acting as a colonial power in the country as it had for decades before. This experience informed my approach to journalism.</p>
<p>First, I learned that news subjects coverage were dependent upon the political tendency of the publication. It rarely matters what the facts are—it matters what readers want, even if that means to serve up a dish of fake news. I also had to learn quickly which types of stories I could pitch to left-leaning papers. For instance, in my early work on gender identity politics, I wrote for one of the few left-of-centre publications that would touch this subject. No other papers on the left would go near this subject. Soon after, however, even that publication told me they couldn't run these stories given that they were invariably met by an onslaught of hate mail. </p>
<p>Second—and the main driver of this fundraiser—is that in my shift to journalism I found that this field operates as a pyramid scheme in terms of which writers receive payment for their work while the rest are expected to write for free. Recently, I pitched a story to a new publication in the UK and was told that this publication doesn’t pay “general freelance contributors.” Imagine telling mechanics that they won’t be paid for their work! You would be left with an idle vehicle. Journalism is work. My first piece on the gender debate from 2013,<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> “</span><a href=""https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/07/the-left-hand-of-darkness/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Left Hand of Darkness</a><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">,” </span>involved months of research, interviews, and fact-checking. I was not paid for this and many other articles since I was employed at the time and I felt committed to not usurp the few resources directed at full-time writers. Now that I am a full-time writer and editor, getting paid isn't an option and like other writers, I feel that our profession deserves a liveable wage. It is time that everyone contribute to ethical labour practices and chip in where and when we can and commit to supporting independent journalism. (Here is where I am tempted to pull out a picture of my two children ages five and eight. They're extremely cute.)</p>
<p>There is a political undercurrent within publishing that affects which news items are deemed “fit to print” and which stories are completely ignored. Just review the <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3950804/Shock-beloved-teacher-transgender-activist-61-charged-stabbing-shooting-death-lesbian-couple-teenage-son-setting-home-fire.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">media</a> surrounding convicted murderer <a href=""https://www.gendertrending.com/2019/08/13/media-blackout-on-dana-rivers-michfest-murder-trial/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dana Rivers or his trial</a>. The fact is that most media <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=%22dana+rivers%22+murder+nytimes&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02uL7bxTDGg3sJkzRmfgCTy8VibaQ:1624002802420&amp;ei=8lDMYLCAGcT-7_UPscGn-Ao&amp;oq=%22dana+rivers%22+murder+nytimes&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECdQ-YcCWLGYAmD5mwJoAXAAeACAAZEBiAHeA5IBAzAuNJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwwZvx2aDxAhVE_7sIHbHgCa8Q4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">did not</a> cover this story at all. Where women are concerned it is often the case that right-of-centre news media will more likely cover these stories whereas the left-leaning media is fully entrenched in identity politics that mostly eschews—and even derides—sex specificity. Where female staff <a href=""https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2019/09/17/the-long-hard-road-to-gender-equality-in-journalism/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">journalists</a> are being <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/why-media-salaries-list/602404/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">paid less</a> than their male cohorts we see that <a href=""https://www.nuj.org.uk/advice/rights-at-work-uk/discrimination-and-equality-including-protected/equal-pay.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">equal pay</a> is more often a concept than it is an <a href=""https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/vice_freelancers.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exercise</a>. In the world of freelance journalism, however, <i>getting paid at all</i> is a struggle as publications are answering their readers's demands. With the surge of online new media since 2000, readers have been trained to consume divisively-postured news stories, purely <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/vetted/?sh=67631fca6dc9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">capitalism-driven infomercials</a> and <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/lists/list-directory/#7b862661b274"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">listicles</a> on ""free"" websites—<i>Forbes</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, the BBC, and other major media outlets, hence this is what the reader's clamour for. All this translates to few journalistic pieces being commissioned about women, the poor or the murderer of a lesbian couple and their child.</p>
<p>This self-fulfilling news cycle is straight out of <i><a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media/dp/0099533111"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Manufacturing Consent</a> </i>(1988) by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky which exposes the ""propaganda model ""of American media and how the press “manufactures” public unity by ensuring that is is exposed to a narrow median body of political ideas, usually in line with political partisanship. Even many independent media outlets are being driven down by neoliberal ideology as unspoken rules are adopted whereby the roots of gender ideology must not be investigated, covering right-wing protests is forbidden, and asking questions about the origins of COVID-19 is verboten. Today the news is more about cheerleading partisan opinion than investigating and fact-checking news events. This is where disaster capitalism has been fully embraced by news organisations that ought to be pushing back and covering these and other uncomfortable stories. </p>
<p>We are launching ""Disappearing Acts"" to return to ethical journalism while covering those stories long-ignored or entirely misrepresented. </p>

<h3><strong>Summary of ""Disappearing Acts""</strong></h3>
<p>“Disappearing Acts” is a series produced by <a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Savage Minds</i></a> whose focus is on investigative journalism, ethnography and video related to various types of disappearance. The title of this series refers to the portion of magician performances where invariably a woman is made to disappear inside of a box or behind a curtain. The disappearances highlighted in our series will focus on various types of vanishing acts from the fading of material reality in public discourse to the disappearance of fact-based reporting within media today to the cover image of this campaign taken from my research on child trafficking.</p>
<p>Where the news media has shifted from telling the stories of events on the ground to focussing on opinion stories and running infomercials for big business as ""news items,"" the links between the physical disappearances of human life to the disappearance of objective journalism are not coincidental. From the disappearance of the word ""woman"" to the newly formed journalistic ethos enshrined into journalist union guidelines which requires that all material reality be abandoned in favour of ideology, we find a common thread in these seemingly disparate disappearances that form part of an intricate journey where media, corporations, NGOs, Big Tech and Big Pharma are collectively complicit in undermining language and objectivity while advancing neoliberal identities for the subject to embrace.</p>
<p>Commercial media strategy today operates within the framework of the rinse and repeat of manufactured news intended to divide along class and party lines. The poor and lower-middle-classes are barely an afterthought in major media coverage today as these voices have long been wiped off of the 24-hour news cycle. Conterminous to the disappearance of fact-based reporting is the manufacturing and curation of various debates by Big Tech today that advance ephemeral identity politics. In an era where sensationalisation and polarisation of the news go hand in hand, many independent media also falls into this pattern of writing up the latest ""angry op-ed"" that will trigger readers' latest resentment ending in a stream of revenue-earning clicks. Sadly, the news model today relies upon activating an ever-angry readership who then turn to social media to share ""outrage stories"" resulting in more clicks despite the fabricated nature of these news stories. Who wants to read about Nile water flowing downstream of <a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/p/water-poverty-and-ethiopias-dam"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ethiopia's GERD</a> when we can get angry about a pronoun ""misuse""?</p>
<p><a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/p/whats-driving-authoritarianism-today"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Media research</a> has shown that much of mainstream news outlets are caught up in spreading misinformation in large part due to how news media is funded as ""<a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/p/whats-driving-authoritarianism-today"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sponsored stories</a>"" have become one of the models for financing larger media operations where outlets like <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/connect/content-solutions/connoisseur/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Forbes</i></a> runs a publication catering to its commercial clients by using its ""journalistic"" cover to provide six-digit funded webspace to companies looking for top-billed advertising. The description for this service Forbes describes on its site, ""Connoisseur provides brands with a direct link to the Forbes audience showcasing everything luxury. This is our artful form of custom storytelling presented in the most visually-stunning and prestigious content formats."" Forbes like other major media regularly produces fake news that is sold as objective reporting. <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/02/world/sponsorships-policy/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CNN</a> also engages in this practice under the moniker of a ""<a href=""https://commercial.cnn.com/brand-solutions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brand solutions</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/02/world/sponsorships-policy/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">special reports</a>,"" running the line between infomercial dressed up as investigative journalism while acting out the full-fledged promotion of a brand. No better example of the power of this lobby could be seen than during lockdown where both media outlets haemorrhaged story after story on vacation travel.</p>
<p>""Disappearing Acts"" is intended to be a permanent series within <i>Savage Minds</i> examining the various historical and present-day problems of how news stories are covered to include the disappearance of on the ground objective reporting along with the rise of infomercials-as-news stories for the multi-national corporations that can pay the prices that major media commands. As many journalists around the planet reporting the news are still suffering the effects of the HuffPost-era erosion of their salaries and profession and readers have been simultaneously trained to accept ""outrage articles"" and listicles as ""news,"" our series will engage reporters on-the-ground to report the news while giving readers information instead of prescriptions for living.</p>
<p>To launch ""Disappearing Acts,"" <i>Savage Minds</i> needs to raise the funds necessary to pay journalists. After a series of discussions with various journalists around the world, the consensus overwhelmingly supports the need to return to bare bones journalism where questions are asked, subjects are interviewed, facts are checked and all sides of the stories covered. Producing ethical news stories requires paying writers and editors a living wage. <a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Savage Minds</i></a> is asking those who are invested in returning to grassroots journalism to support this series.</p>
<p>Some of the topics ""Disappearing Acts"" will cover include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p><strong>-the disappearance of women and girls and the conterminous rise of Big Pharma</strong></p>
<p><strong>-the disappeared bodies of human trafficking</strong></p>
<p><strong>-the lobbies promoting the disappearance of free speech</strong></p>
<p><strong>-the disappearance of science &amp; the promotion of legal fictions (identity politics)</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Big Tech's containment of the news through social media censorship</strong></p>
<p><strong>-the disappearance of objective news media in the age of sponsored news stories</strong></p>
<p>""Disappearing Acts” will follow these and other subjects through the analyses of events and the inclusion of interviews, expert voices and meta-analyses.</p>
<p>We must connect the dots between major media's non-stop laudatory coverage of Bill Gates during the pandemic while the creators of the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/18/covid-herd-immunity-funding-bad-science-anti-lockdown"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Great Barrington Declaration</a> have been painted as ""unhinged"" science deniers. ""Disappearing Acts"" will hold major media and Big Tech accountable as to why the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/the-media-called-the-lab-leak-story-a-conspiracy-theory-now-its-prompted-corrections--and-serious-new-reporting/2021/06/10/c93972e6-c7b2-11eb-a11b-6c6191ccd599_story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">origins of COVID-19</a> are now being revised retroactively by news outlets and why social media giants are stifling discussion about this issue. In an era where political and scientific query necessitates coverage, dialectic and information from all sides, it is clear that major news outlets are operating as propaganda platforms with no due diligence to truth while disappearing what they deem to be oppositional voices and the lives of the disenfranchised.</p>
<p>Please help fund “Disappearing Acts” so that we can expand our news coverage to fact-based reporting while paying journalists on the ground for their labour.</p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Given that the aim is to support full-time journalists who contribute to <i>Savage Minds</i>, this isn't a luxury fundraiser—we are a bare-bones operation. We understand that it's been a rough year plus for many so even if you can't donate today, please do spread the word about what we are doing here. The core message of this fundraiser is that people begin to understand the direct links between how journalism is funded and why certain stories <i>are not being covered</i> (eg. the disappearance of women and the word “woman”) in mainstream media while <i>other news items are covered</i> (eg. the news this week that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t affect sperm count). Great news for sperm, bad news for women. </p>
<p>So if you are hurting economically as so many are in this era of a global pandemic, there are other ways to support ""Disappearing Voices."" First, sign up for <i>Savage Minds </i><a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/subscribe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">free subscriptions</a>. Most of what we publish is free. Second, please share our articles and podcast episodes on social media. Lastly, there are many other <a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/p/max-blumenthal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">excellent independent publications</a> out there that need funding and that are doing excellent work. Give them your support and shares as well!</p>
<p>The bottom line is that we need to shift those .35 cents a day we used to spend on a newspaper from a few decades ago into real-time currency which—even at 1990 rates—translates to just over €10 a month. We must join the dots between major media serving up half-truths, their corporate partners and the ""<a href=""https://savageminds.substack.com/p/whats-driving-authoritarianism-today"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sponsored stories</a>"" (infomercials) and the downgrading of journalism as a professional practice by blurring the line between reporting, personal empowerment and a mirror.</p>
<p>Let's push together to create a more ethical news series where writers are paid, news coverage is not fabricated and objectivity is brought back into journalism.</p>

</div></div>","Journalism is important and its defunding, which actually takes place at grassroots level, stifles and disrupts free speech and the public access to alternative and often vital news. Have you heard about Dana Rivers? Most of you reading this haven’t. Yet women have been asking why this story has gone ignored by major and independent media. You are directly affected by this because if you are only hearing one message from large organisations with an agenda, you will not be aware of alternative viewpoints or stories that have been buried by propaganda. You will be uninformed. Supporting grass roots journalism ensures that a variety of views can be expressed, considered and evaluated. That is the basis of a free speech democracy which you and the generations to come need to thrive.
Background to Launching ""Disappearing Acts""
I am Julian Vigo, an anthropologist, writer, filmmaker and editor of Savage Minds. I came into journalism after a career in academia. In 2010 I left academia and went to Haiti to conduct an ethnographic-journalistic project on child trafficking to include an analysis of the problems within the NGO and UN model which professionalised older colonial ideologies and professions, shifting them from “viceroy” to “humanitarian worker.” Meanwhile, these humanitarian disasters were pretty much all manmade with human trafficking being as much a byproduct of ""humanitarian work"" as much it was a product of its orbiting politics and not a coincidental manifestation. Still, there was no media coverage critical of the NGO and UN presence very much acting as a colonial power in the country as it had for decades before. This experience informed my approach to journalism.
First, I learned that news subjects coverage were dependent upon the political tendency of the publication. It rarely matters what the facts are—it matters what readers want, even if that means to serve up a dish of fake news. I also had to learn quickly which types of stories I could pitch to left-leaning papers. For instance, in my early work on gender identity politics, I wrote for one of the few left-of-centre publications that would touch this subject. No other papers on the left would go near this subject. Soon after, however, even that publication told me they couldn't run these stories given that they were invariably met by an onslaught of hate mail. 
Second—and the main driver of this fundraiser—is that in my shift to journalism I found that this field operates as a pyramid scheme in terms of which writers receive payment for their work while the rest are expected to write for free. Recently, I pitched a story to a new publication in the UK and was told that this publication doesn’t pay “general freelance contributors.” Imagine telling mechanics that they won’t be paid for their work! You would be left with an idle vehicle. Journalism is work. My first piece on the gender debate from 2013, “The Left Hand of Darkness,” involved months of research, interviews, and fact-checking. I was not paid for this and many other articles since I was employed at the time and I felt committed to not usurp the few resources directed at full-time writers. Now that I am a full-time writer and editor, getting paid isn't an option and like other writers, I feel that our profession deserves a liveable wage. It is time that everyone contribute to ethical labour practices and chip in where and when we can and commit to supporting independent journalism. (Here is where I am tempted to pull out a picture of my two children ages five and eight. They're extremely cute.)
There is a political undercurrent within publishing that affects which news items are deemed “fit to print” and which stories are completely ignored. Just review the media surrounding convicted murderer Dana Rivers or his trial. The fact is that most media did not cover this story at all. Where women are concerned it is often the case that right-of-centre news media will more likely cover these stories whereas the left-leaning media is fully entrenched in identity politics that mostly eschews—and even derides—sex specificity. Where female staff journalists are being paid less than their male cohorts we see that equal pay is more often a concept than it is an exercise. In the world of freelance journalism, however, getting paid at all is a struggle as publications are answering their readers's demands. With the surge of online new media since 2000, readers have been trained to consume divisively-postured news stories, purely capitalism-driven infomercials and listicles on ""free"" websites—Forbes, Newsweek, the BBC, and other major media outlets, hence this is what the reader's clamour for. All this translates to few journalistic pieces being commissioned about women, the poor or the murderer of a lesbian couple and their child.
This self-fulfilling news cycle is straight out of Manufacturing Consent (1988) by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky which exposes the ""propaganda model ""of American media and how the press “manufactures” public unity by ensuring that is is exposed to a narrow median body of political ideas, usually in line with political partisanship. Even many independent media outlets are being driven down by neoliberal ideology as unspoken rules are adopted whereby the roots of gender ideology must not be investigated, covering right-wing protests is forbidden, and asking questions about the origins of COVID-19 is verboten. Today the news is more about cheerleading partisan opinion than investigating and fact-checking news events. This is where disaster capitalism has been fully embraced by news organisations that ought to be pushing back and covering these and other uncomfortable stories. 
We are launching ""Disappearing Acts"" to return to ethical journalism while covering those stories long-ignored or entirely misrepresented. 

Summary of ""Disappearing Acts""
“Disappearing Acts” is a series produced by Savage Minds whose focus is on investigative journalism, ethnography and video related to various types of disappearance. The title of this series refers to the portion of magician performances where invariably a woman is made to disappear inside of a box or behind a curtain. The disappearances highlighted in our series will focus on various types of vanishing acts from the fading of material reality in public discourse to the disappearance of fact-based reporting within media today to the cover image of this campaign taken from my research on child trafficking.
Where the news media has shifted from telling the stories of events on the ground to focussing on opinion stories and running infomercials for big business as ""news items,"" the links between the physical disappearances of human life to the disappearance of objective journalism are not coincidental. From the disappearance of the word ""woman"" to the newly formed journalistic ethos enshrined into journalist union guidelines which requires that all material reality be abandoned in favour of ideology, we find a common thread in these seemingly disparate disappearances that form part of an intricate journey where media, corporations, NGOs, Big Tech and Big Pharma are collectively complicit in undermining language and objectivity while advancing neoliberal identities for the subject to embrace.
Commercial media strategy today operates within the framework of the rinse and repeat of manufactured news intended to divide along class and party lines. The poor and lower-middle-classes are barely an afterthought in major media coverage today as these voices have long been wiped off of the 24-hour news cycle. Conterminous to the disappearance of fact-based reporting is the manufacturing and curation of various debates by Big Tech today that advance ephemeral identity politics. In an era where sensationalisation and polarisation of the news go hand in hand, many independent media also falls into this pattern of writing up the latest ""angry op-ed"" that will trigger readers' latest resentment ending in a stream of revenue-earning clicks. Sadly, the news model today relies upon activating an ever-angry readership who then turn to social media to share ""outrage stories"" resulting in more clicks despite the fabricated nature of these news stories. Who wants to read about Nile water flowing downstream of Ethiopia's GERD when we can get angry about a pronoun ""misuse""?
Media research has shown that much of mainstream news outlets are caught up in spreading misinformation in large part due to how news media is funded as ""sponsored stories"" have become one of the models for financing larger media operations where outlets like Forbes runs a publication catering to its commercial clients by using its ""journalistic"" cover to provide six-digit funded webspace to companies looking for top-billed advertising. The description for this service Forbes describes on its site, ""Connoisseur provides brands with a direct link to the Forbes audience showcasing everything luxury. This is our artful form of custom storytelling presented in the most visually-stunning and prestigious content formats."" Forbes like other major media regularly produces fake news that is sold as objective reporting. CNN also engages in this practice under the moniker of a ""brand solutions"" and ""special reports,"" running the line between infomercial dressed up as investigative journalism while acting out the full-fledged promotion of a brand. No better example of the power of this lobby could be seen than during lockdown where both media outlets haemorrhaged story after story on vacation travel.
""Disappearing Acts"" is intended to be a permanent series within Savage Minds examining the various historical and present-day problems of how news stories are covered to include the disappearance of on the ground objective reporting along with the rise of infomercials-as-news stories for the multi-national corporations that can pay the prices that major media commands. As many journalists around the planet reporting the news are still suffering the effects of the HuffPost-era erosion of their salaries and profession and readers have been simultaneously trained to accept ""outrage articles"" and listicles as ""news,"" our series will engage reporters on-the-ground to report the news while giving readers information instead of prescriptions for living.
To launch ""Disappearing Acts,"" Savage Minds needs to raise the funds necessary to pay journalists. After a series of discussions with various journalists around the world, the consensus overwhelmingly supports the need to return to bare bones journalism where questions are asked, subjects are interviewed, facts are checked and all sides of the stories covered. Producing ethical news stories requires paying writers and editors a living wage. Savage Minds is asking those who are invested in returning to grassroots journalism to support this series.
Some of the topics ""Disappearing Acts"" will cover include, but are not limited to:
-the disappearance of women and girls and the conterminous rise of Big Pharma
-the disappeared bodies of human trafficking
-the lobbies promoting the disappearance of free speech
-the disappearance of science & the promotion of legal fictions (identity politics)
-Big Tech's containment of the news through social media censorship
-the disappearance of objective news media in the age of sponsored news stories
""Disappearing Acts” will follow these and other subjects through the analyses of events and the inclusion of interviews, expert voices and meta-analyses.
We must connect the dots between major media's non-stop laudatory coverage of Bill Gates during the pandemic while the creators of the Great Barrington Declaration have been painted as ""unhinged"" science deniers. ""Disappearing Acts"" will hold major media and Big Tech accountable as to why the origins of COVID-19 are now being revised retroactively by news outlets and why social media giants are stifling discussion about this issue. In an era where political and scientific query necessitates coverage, dialectic and information from all sides, it is clear that major news outlets are operating as propaganda platforms with no due diligence to truth while disappearing what they deem to be oppositional voices and the lives of the disenfranchised.
Please help fund “Disappearing Acts” so that we can expand our news coverage to fact-based reporting while paying journalists on the ground for their labour.

<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/zR_1siujS3M"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Full length interview with the author, C. T. Giles</a></p>
<h3>The Story Behind the Story</h3>
<p>The New Testament tells us about the Birth of Jesus, a sparse amount about His infancy, one single episode when He's 12 years old, and then the Gospel accounts don't resume the narrative until He's thirty. Have you ever wondered about His boyhood years? I have spent half a lifetime obsessed with this curiosity.</p>
<p>Last year, one image, a single scene, overtook my entire imagination. I saw Joseph walk into his workshop to the surprise of finding Jesus distraught, His eyes transfixed on the timber before Him.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>On January 6th, 2020 we concluded a *successful* Kickstarter campaign, achieving 137% of our initial goal. This has become a great boon to our launch of the novel.

Additionally, backers who opt for the hardback receive a signed copy. What's more, you're continuing to help us get the word out. Feedback from beta-readers has been wildly enthusiastic. We expect great things from the work of this story once it's released out into the world. Your support gets us there all the sooner.</p>

</div></div>","Chapter 1 of When God Was a Boy
Full length interview with the author, C. T. Giles
The Story Behind the Story
The New Testament tells us about the Birth of Jesus, a sparse amount about His infancy, one single episode when He's 12 years old, and then the Gospel accounts don't resume the narrative until He's thirty. Have you ever wondered about His boyhood years? I have spent half a lifetime obsessed with this curiosity.
Last year, one image, a single scene, overtook my entire imagination. I saw Joseph walk into his workshop to the surprise of finding Jesus distraught, His eyes transfixed on the timber before Him. That reverie would not leave me alone for weeks. So, I wrote it out, sent it to some friends and family, and awaited their collective response. Their replies prompted that short story growing into a book.
Writing this novel was like an 18 month practice in prayerful meditation, attempting to experience through my heart and mind the places where He grew up and the people He encountered. During the process, I became very familiar with Joseph. He taught me a great deal about the Father's heart.

<p>A year ago, the otherworld fantasy romance Fine Print began serialized publication on <a href=""https://www.fimfiction.net/user/173490/Starscribe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fimfiction</a>. Now that story has reached its end. After receiving numerous requests from readers, I’ve made the appropriate arrangements to produce my fifth independently published book.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618544960/tyulelanvghhzd9lacq7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to fund a small print run and publication of Fine Print. The book will be a glossy 6”x 9” hardcover with approximately 460 full color pages. The book will include over <strong>50</strong> illustrations from artists all over the fandom, such as Acesential (who is also doing the cover!), Viwrapstur, DiscordGE, Rutkotka, Pony-way, Lunebat, Lines, Julunis, Xbi, and more!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618544987/wfkhvvmudt9al0oyw303.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It will also include a <strong>10,000 word </strong>extended epilogue, never to be published anywhere else, which will show more of Spark Gap’s life with Rose after making his decision at the end of the book. It may have a small number of not-before-seen illustrations, but most of the images present in the book will be high resolution prints of those already shown on Fimfiction.</p>
<p>Printing a book has certain physical constraints, and I want the hardcover to match the quality of the story it will contain. The printer requires a minimum run-size of 50 books, so that is the number we’ll have to hit to be successful (and is where the campaign goal comes from). For those who wish to support the author, you can also opt to order a signed and numbered edition for a few bucks more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618544999/kka37chrldbfnybaur39.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Those who want copies of any of the previous books I’ve printed will also be able to select them as add-on perks, since the printer will be able to make a few more with this order if we reach our goal. Those are <strong>Last Pony on Earth</strong>, <strong>Through the Aurora</strong>, and <strong>Message in a Bottle</strong>. Simply select them as add-ons while placing the order. Orders of multiple books will have reduced shipping costs, but must be going to the same destination address.</p>
<p>Those who wish to donate a little extra to support the author can also make a chapter suggestion with their order. However, like the Last Pony on Earth project, Fine Print was made to stand on its own, and I can’t make random additions that would weaken the story. As such, these extra chapter suggestions would only be included in the print if both I and the original commissioner agreed that they would benefit the plot. If not, they’d be posted to Fimfiction only.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We cannot print fewer than fifty books, which makes this the minimum size for the campaign to be successful. If we do not reach this goal, Fine Print cannot be made, so everyone will be refunded.</p>
<p>Also, it’s important to remember that COVID is resurging across the world. This may impact international shipping times, and delay printing unexpectedly. Nevertheless, we were able to get Through the Aurora made and shipped to all backers during the height of the pandemic last year, so I have no doubt we’ll be able to get these books out too.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Can't contribute? That's fine! Obviously I'm not printing this story for the money--it's all about getting something awesome out in print. I don't expect anyone who isn't interested in hardcover books to order.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help but you don't want the book, feel free to share this campaign with anyone you think might be interested. Like anything in publication, this project gets easier the larger the volume of books we're printing. And if you'd just like to check out the story but for some reason you haven't yet, <a href=""https://www.fimfiction.net/story/463533/fine-print"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">you can read it here for free.</a></p>

Hex | End doesn’t go out of its way to offend anyone, but it will never walk on eggshells or cave to political correctness.</p><p>And Hex | End will never be sold to a certain mouse corporation.

What makes literature great is not its potential utility to spread propaganda, but because it’s a way to communicate timeless, universal themes that everyone could appreciate regardless of anything but their common humanity.</p><p>The worldbuilding for Hex | End has been exciting and challenging thus far. The multiverse of the story is massive in scope and the vision for its future is even bigger. As more installments are added in the future, (contingent on the success of this first installment), more and more content will be added in hopes this world will become a place where people will want to spend their time, whether it’s simply in one's imagination, or playing as a character of their own in an as-of-yet undeveloped TRPG, or enjoying other forms of multimedia Hex | End could potentially find itself in in the future.</p><p>One last note, (and thanks for bearing with this long exposition). This series doesn’t have a hard, fixed publishing-industry standard target age. Though it will likely appeal to a certain age range more than another, it’s not written with that pigeon-holing mentality.

Life is what they make it—even if it’s already dead.Despite their common interests in the fictional and fantastical, Edgar and Lucretcia are two long-time friends who can’t seem to agree on much when it comes to the question: Is real life too dull?It just so happens, they don’t have to come to an agreement—at least not on their own.A typical afterschool gaming session with their buddies in the EIDOLON tabletop role-playing club, takes a turn for the grave in a roll of the dice. The stakes go from practically nothing to unimaginably high when the six friends are bafflingly imbued with their fictional characters’ magick and abilities. And if that weren’t enough to turn their minds’ inside-out and worlds’ upside-down, Yaldovrath, a lich from their Gateways: Swords & Sorcery campaign traverses the impossible gulf between their fantasy world and reality, and he’s got a major bone to pick. To make matters worse, he’s being abetted by allies in both worlds: a sinister death cult and an imprisoned eldritch monstrosity.As Yaldovrath’s tide of undead soldiers rises in the heart of the shining capital metropolis of Ephialtes, EIDOLON and company have to get their act together if they want to survive, let alone figure out the mystery at the heart of these unfortunate events to put a stop to it—if that’s truly what they want to do. No special editions, no fluff. Just a straight-up light novel.
6x9 paperback novel
Illustrated with manga-style artwork à la Japanese light novels

Roughly 200,000 words, (okay, so, it's a not-quite-'light' novel)

On the one hand, it’s about heritage that can be found literally where the grass roots grow. On the other hand, and more importantly, it reflects the fact that very few tangible artifacts of Taiwan’s common person’s day-to-day life can be found untouched. The island’s more popular heritage--its temples, events, and buildings--have been changed or modified over the centuries to suit the needs of the island’s government. Over the past 400 years Taiwan has been settled and administered by successive waves of migrants, conquerors, and colonists. The winners write history. The Dutch, Ming Dynasty loyalists, Qing Dynasty, Imperial Japan, and more recently the martial law of the Nationalist government were the writers, and each successive regime put its stamp nearly everywhere.

Grassroots Heritage: The Many Untold Stories of A Taiwan Cemetery  is a publication about a cemetery in Taiwan. It explores the rich cultural value cemeteries have, which, due to superstitions, are completely ignored… and destroyed.Few people realize the cemeteries in Taiwan are treasure troves of cultural heritage, artwork, lost or forgotten genealogy, some compelling mysteries, and yes… even treasure.Preference for development means many heritage cemeteries are being bulldozed. It’s estimated within 10 years there will be no more cemeteries left in Taiwan.This book looks at one cemetery in northern Taiwan as a litmus test for heritage preservation. Author James X. Morris has been collecting information and stories, and salvaging artifacts with a coalition of preservationists as the Xindian First Public Cemetery has fallen victim to bulldozers and city development. No archaeological survey was done before its destruction, and the only way the stories were documented was through the efforts of preservationists. The hope is to inspire a public recognition that cemeteries are heritage.In partnership with two leading voices on Taiwan humanities—SMC Publishing in Taipei and the Asia-Pacific SpatioTemporal Institute at National Chengchi University in Taipei—Grassroots Heritage is a book about the many untold stories sitting in plain sight, ignored by most Taiwan history books. Part history book, part art catalogue, part investigative journalism, and part warning call, Grassroots Heritage collects and presents the untold stories of one cemetery to inspire a new understanding of the central storytelling role cemeteries around the world play in helping communities know their heritage.GRASSROOTS HERITAGE: THE MANY UNTOLD STORIES OF A TAIWAN CEMETERY是個關於台灣的一座墓園的書。 它探討了墓園所具有的豐富文化價值，這些文化價值，由於迷信，被完全忽視......并且被摧毀。很少人意識到台灣的墓園是個珍貴的寶庫，其蘊藏著文化遺產、藝術品、被丟失或被遺忘的家譜、一些扣人心弦的謎團，甚至......沒錯，甚至寶藏。對發展的偏愛意味著許多公墓遺產正在被推土機鏟平。 根據估計，10年之內台灣將不再有墓園。這本書著眼於台灣北部的一座墓園作為遺產保護的試金石。 作者James X. Morris一直在收集信息和故事，並與一群保護主義者們共同搶救文物，因為新店第一公墓已成為推土機和城市發展的犧牲品。 在新店第一公墓被破壞之前，該公墓並沒有被進行過任何考古調查，而有關該公墓的許多故事之所以能被記錄，全是靠保護主義者們的努力。 希望能激發公眾認識到墓園是文化遺產。與台灣人文學科的兩個先鋒合作 - 台北的南天書局（SMC Publishing ）和台北國立政治大學的亞太時空資訊研究所（Asia-Pacific SpatioTemporal Institute——Grassroots Heritage 這本書是關於許多未被敘述且被大多數台灣歷史書籍所忽視的故事。 一部分是歷史書、一部分是藝術圖錄，一部分是調查性報道和一部分是警訊，Grassroots Heritage 收集並呈現一座墓園的許多故事，以激發人們對於墓園，這個橫跨世界各地的主要故事敘述者，產生一種新的理解，以此幫助社區了解他們的文化遺產。 CONTENTS / 内容 HISTORY / 歷史Grassroots Heritage shares the history of northern Taiwan, zeroing in on Xindian District, and exploring the traditional practices associated with death, burial, and ancestor worship.

On the one hand, it’s about heritage that can be found literally where the grass roots grow. On the other hand, and more importantly, it reflects the fact that very few tangible artifacts of Taiwan’s common person’s day-to-day life can be found untouched. The island’s more popular heritage--its temples, events, and buildings--have been changed or modified over the centuries to suit the needs of the island’s government. Over the past 400 years Taiwan has been settled and administered by successive waves of migrants, conquerors, and colonists. The winners write history. The Dutch, Ming Dynasty loyalists, Qing Dynasty, Imperial Japan, and more recently the martial law of the Nationalist government were the writers, and each successive regime put its stamp nearly everywhere. Tomb assemblages and tombstones largely managed to escape the censors, and were used by the Taiwanese as means to express themselves. Some were even used as markers of political dissent.If you want to find Taiwan grassroots heritage, it’s in the cemeteries.Grassroots Heritage 是一個雙關語。一方面，它指的是能在草根生長之處發現的文化遺產。另一方面，更重要的是，它反映了這樣一個事實，即台灣民衆的日常生活中幾乎難以發現任何有形文物是原封未動的。這島嶼更受歡迎的遺產，即寺廟、活動和建築，已經經歷過幾個世紀的改變或修改，以滿足島上政府的需求。在過去的400年裡，台灣一直由移民、征服者和殖民者的浪潮定居和管理。勝者寫歷史。荷蘭、明朝的效忠者、清朝，日本的帝國，以及近代的國民政府的戒嚴都是作家，且每個歷届政權都在到處留下他們的印記。墓葬組合和墓碑在很大程度上逃脫了審查，並被台灣人用作表達自己的手段。有些甚至被用作政治異議的標誌。如果你想找到台灣的草根遺產，它就在墓園裡。  PUBLISHING TIMEFRAME / 出版之時間框架The fieldwork for Grassroots Heritage is already complete. The next steps are to organize the contents and prepare the final draft for publication with Southern Materials Company (南天書局), the most prolific international Taiwan studies publishing house located in Taipei.Estimated delivery time will be in the winter of 2018/2019.

<p>My name is Donte Woods-Spikes. In Columbus Ohio, I’m known for using different forms of storytelling to encourage empathy among communities. In 2016 I gave a TEDx talk titled <i>Young Black Men, Not Left Out Again</i>. In 2020, my documentary film <i>As a Matter of Black</i> was selected as an official Sundance Film Festival selection. As of 2021, I'm in the process of finishing my first book:  So.Long. - Unfinished Good-byes with the Children of COVID-19.</p>
<p>After my dream of working with children became a reality, COVID-19 brought my dream to a halt. While the nation was forced into quarantine, I began reflecting on every powerful lesson different children taught me. Children I had worked with as a teacher's aide shifted my disciplinary practices and forced me to address my own childhood traumas. They made me realize the lifetime impact my words and actions can have on children.</p>
<p>Every educator questions how much they impact children's lives. This book will invite them, parents, and child advocates into the raw world of children. This book is by far my most vulnerable and meaningful work to date. With your help, I'll be able to create a national dialogue revolving around the well-being of children. Thank you for all of your support.</p>
<p>This book will be published on Amazon as a print and e-book.  If we exceed our fundraising goals we can also have it produced as an audio book!  We are contracting with professional editors who can maintain my voice and dialect that most honestly reflects my experience with the children.  Our total costs will be near $2000 to produce the book.  The additional $1000 will help pay for the book release celebration that everyone is invited to attend at the Columbus Museum of Art on October 24 at 2:00pm!</p>
<p>Every contributor will receive a signed copy of the book.  You can also receive a pen, poster, t-shirt or book bag, as we all celebrate the stories of these amazing children.   For a special contribution, we will welcome you to the book release celebration as a special guest!</p>

<h3>Our story</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tamara and I am a mother and writer. There aren't any other things in my life that I am more passionate about. My writing career began in the Army where I served as a Photojournalist and Public Affairs officer (46Q) for 6 years, with one tour in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>I was recently awarded a $2,000 scholarship to the Gateless Academy to help finish, edit, and traditionally market and publish my novel, <i>Buttermilk. </i>The remainder of the academy is $4,500. I am trying to gather the remaining cost of the 10-month program before the first part of the Academy starts in late September with a little extra to pay some bills so I can concentrate on writing over freelancing my life away. </p>
<p>The program director contacted me personally to award me the scholarship and shared that my manuscript was one of the best she had received out of thousands they are sent every year. I am grateful for the opportunity and would hate to miss it because I do not have the rest of the money. </p>

<p>I am a disabled veteran and single mother and since COVID, I have not had the work available to me to save money to budget in this type of training. Your support will not only help me fulfill my dreams of becoming an author and publishing this book, but I will be able to prove to my daughter that everything is possible no matter where you are at in life if you just ask or put yourself out there. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need is simple, funding to help me proceed with the Academy and a little extra to support me through the 10 months.</p>
<p>All those who donate will receive a signed published book with a handwritten letter from me thanking you for your support. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will allow me the dream of becoming an Author. It allows me a deadline and a process. I suffer from a personality disorder, anxiety, and depressive disorder due to events that took place in the military, which makes it hard for me to maintain steady work. I am constantly in therapy and have had no help with disability from the VA. However, being put into a program to help me finish this novel will give me the structure I need to follow through. </p>
<p>It gives me hope, and I know that when this novel is published, It will be a #1 best seller. I have known it from the first word I typed. Due to my disabilities, there will be challenges. I need structure, accountability and guidance to complete this body of work, and that its what the Academy offers. </p>
