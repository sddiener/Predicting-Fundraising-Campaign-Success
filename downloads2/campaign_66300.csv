<li>Parents are very busy.  They need tools that are quick and easy to use.  Those tools should minimize stress, not create stress by demanding frequent attention or long, complicated setup or maintenance to realize their value.</li>
<li>Managing kids' screen time is a universal need.  Filtering or blocking what kids do online is also a need, but one that is difficult to address in a ""one size fits all"" manner.</li>
</ol><p>Through research and testing, we have discovered that providing a filtering/blocking solution is difficult to do in a way that both requires minimal effort and is flexible enough to satisfy the broad spectrum of what different parents deem safe or acceptable for their kids.  Products on the market that attempt to do this often require a significant investment of time to configure and maintain for parents to extract the value they expect those products to deliver.</p><p> </p><h3>How is the technology behind ryfi different than other parental routers?</h3><p>Many parental routers use technology that is very invasive and disruptive to the existing home network.  Some use a technology known as ARP Spoofing (also called ARP Poisoning), a technique known to cause problems with other connected home devices.  In some cases, those devices (ex. Nest, Echo, Vonage, Ring) need to be reprogrammed as a result of introducing a parental router into the home network.  Even after disconnecting those devices, or disconnecting the parental router itself, the home network may not function as it originally did, sometimes requiring professional-level technical expertise to troubleshoot and fix.</p><p>ryfi is not intended to be the primary router on the home network, and does not disturb any of the existing setup or connected devices.  ryfi only interacts with the existing router as its way of sending and receiving internet traffic.  It does not interact with any other devices on the network or place any unusual demands on the existing router.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Does ryfi come with internet service?</h3><p>No, ryfi is intended to be used with existing internet service.</p><p> </p><h3>Does ryfi provide control over mobile phones on a data plan that are not using wifi?</h3><p>No.  Currently, ryfi provides control only when internet devices are connected to it over wifi.  Mobile phones, tablets or other devices using cellular data to connect to the internet would not be controlled by ryfi.</p><p> </p><h3>Can't you do what ryfi does on a regular router?</h3><p>The ability to control and schedule a router via an app or SMS is not a common feature on most routers. We have designed ryfi so that these features are very easy to setup and control.  Those routers that do have these capabilities typically require advanced technical skill to access, configure and maintain.  </p><p> </p><h3>Does this block dating sites, adult sites or social networks?</h3><p>No.  ryfi is focused on managing screen time.  While there is some content on the internet that is universally acknowledged as unhealthy for kids, it is difficult to design a solution that meets our standards for being absolutely reliable (filters out the content it claims to), flexible enough to work for different parents in the way they prefer, and easy enough to use that it remains accessible for nearly everyone.  We are actively researching additional features for ryfi, filtering and blocking being among them, but prefer to maintain the quality and integrity of our products by not releasing new features until we are confident they meet the needs of our customers while following our design principles of simplicity, flexibility and high quality.</p><p> </p><h3>Will you be collecting my data for advertising purposes?</h3><p>Absolutely not. Our pricing model allows us to focus on a positive user experience without relying on advertising revenue.  We only collect basic account information, such as your name and email address and the model and version number of your ryfi, to allow us to provide product and customer support.</p><p> </p><h3>Do I need technical skills to set up ryfi?</h3><p>No. We designed ryfi to be accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skill level. The ryfi device only requires two cables to be connected, one to a power outlet and the other to the existing router or modem.  The mobile app follows design best practices and will be accessible to anyone with a basic comfort level using mobile apps.</p></div>","Pre-order your ryfi today!Lock in a 25% discount and receive your ryfi before the end of March - right around spring break time!Not ready to pre-order yet?  Share your email with us and we'll keep you updated about ryfi as we approach our launch date.  We'll be sure to find a way to thank our early fans (although pre-ordering is the way to get your best discount!).ryfi is the world's first router that helps parents track homework and chores.Now your kids can focus on critical tasks like homework and chores before indulging in sedentary screen time. ryfi™ will notify you when their tasks are done, and allow you to track rewards for them including internet time.

Make sure that kids aren't surfing during bed time. You can override this schedule at anytime with a simple text command.  ""Oh wow, we NEED this at home. Creating a structured approach to screen time like this would make life a lot easier."" - Andrea, Insurance Executive, Anaheim Hills, Mother of 2""I love the simplicity. My husband brought something similar to ryfi a while ago but it was so complicated to set up. And once we finally did that, we had so many issues with the connection that we gave up and took it back. I'm looking forward to your Indiegogo campaign!""- Summer, Nurse Huntington Beach, Mother of a 5 year oldHere's just a sample of what they're saying on Facebook about ryfi!   As a dad of three, I know it's difficult to balance screen time and family time. I’ve seen first hand the proliferation of technology devices in our household, leading to the overused phrase ""Just five more minutes?"" Kim & I found a few products that manage family internet, but they were complicated. They had so many features and gadgets, it was overwhelming. Life is complicated enough and we wanted simplicity.There had to be a better way.But there wasn't. So we built it ourselves.Co-founders John and Eric have been best friends since being roommates at Caltech, where Eric served as John's alarm clock, splashing water on his face (by request!) to wake him early in the morning during exam week.  That trust and confidence in each other allows us to design awesome products together without worrying about who's right or who gets credit.  We care passionately about designing products that solve real problems and are easy to use.  When we succeed, we both share in the feeling of accomplishment that comes from creating something that benefits individuals and society.We've always cared about finding others who share that philosophy, believing we'll be most successful surrounding ourselves with good, genuine, selfless people.  A huge part of our success in bringing ryfi to life is due to the efforts of those who have taken us from being ""John and Eric"" to being the ""ryfi team"" you see below.  FAQsHow does this differ from other parental control routers?PRODUCT FOCUS ryfi has been designed with one goal in mind, to provide parents an easy to use tool to manage their kids' time online.  ryfi does not attempt to filter, block or otherwise interfere with or interpret kids' internet use.  While some parents may prefer a more complex tool with additional features, we discovered two principles that drove the ryfi design:
Parents are very busy.  They need tools that are quick and easy to use.  Those tools should minimize stress, not create stress by demanding frequent attention or long, complicated setup or maintenance to realize their value.
Managing kids' screen time is a universal need.  Filtering or blocking what kids do online is also a need, but one that is difficult to address in a ""one size fits all"" manner.
Through research and testing, we have discovered that providing a filtering/blocking solution is difficult to do in a way that both requires minimal effort and is flexible enough to satisfy the broad spectrum of what different parents deem safe or acceptable for their kids.  Products on the market that attempt to do this often require a significant investment of time to configure and maintain for parents to extract the value they expect those products to deliver. How is the technology behind ryfi different than other parental routers?Many parental routers use technology that is very invasive and disruptive to the existing home network.  Some use a technology known as ARP Spoofing (also called ARP Poisoning), a technique known to cause problems with other connected home devices.  In some cases, those devices (ex. Nest, Echo, Vonage, Ring) need to be reprogrammed as a result of introducing a parental router into the home network.  Even after disconnecting those devices, or disconnecting the parental router itself, the home network may not function as it originally did, sometimes requiring professional-level technical expertise to troubleshoot and fix.ryfi is not intended to be the primary router on the home network, and does not disturb any of the existing setup or connected devices.  ryfi only interacts with the existing router as its way of sending and receiving internet traffic.  It does not interact with any other devices on the network or place any unusual demands on the existing router. Does ryfi come with internet service?No, ryfi is intended to be used with existing internet service. Does ryfi provide control over mobile phones on a data plan that are not using wifi?No.  Currently, ryfi provides control only when internet devices are connected to it over wifi.  Mobile phones, tablets or other devices using cellular data to connect to the internet would not be controlled by ryfi. Can't you do what ryfi does on a regular router?The ability to control and schedule a router via an app or SMS is not a common feature on most routers. We have designed ryfi so that these features are very easy to setup and control.  Those routers that do have these capabilities typically require advanced technical skill to access, configure and maintain.   Does this block dating sites, adult sites or social networks?No.  ryfi is focused on managing screen time.  While there is some content on the internet that is universally acknowledged as unhealthy for kids, it is difficult to design a solution that meets our standards for being absolutely reliable (filters out the content it claims to), flexible enough to work for different parents in the way they prefer, and easy enough to use that it remains accessible for nearly everyone.  We are actively researching additional features for ryfi, filtering and blocking being among them, but prefer to maintain the quality and integrity of our products by not releasing new features until we are confident they meet the needs of our customers while following our design principles of simplicity, flexibility and high quality. Will you be collecting my data for advertising purposes?Absolutely not. Our pricing model allows us to focus on a positive user experience without relying on advertising revenue.  We only collect basic account information, such as your name and email address and the model and version number of your ryfi, to allow us to provide product and customer support. Do I need technical skills to set up ryfi?No. We designed ryfi to be accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skill level. The ryfi device only requires two cables to be connected, one to a power outlet and the other to the existing router or modem.  The mobile app follows design best practices and will be accessible to anyone with a basic comfort level using mobile apps.",34.0,1,"1 Campaign

And researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham recently found that brushes stored in the bathroom—a.k.a. all of them—are contaminated with fecal germs, among other bacteria.    
Using a cover on your toothbrush after brushing your teeth seems like a good idea but, actually, it's poor health practice. Moisture gets trapped within the cap keeping your toothbrush bristles from drying. This promotes bacterial growth.
The bathroom countertop is home to 452 bacteria per square inch, so if you leave your toothbrush on it, you’re putting those bacteria in your mouth.  
Bacteria can spread from one head of a toothbrush to another when the bristles touch. If your family member is sick or has an infection, touching toothbrushes could spread their illness and germs to you. 
       There are countless toothbrush holders and sanitizers on the market today but almost none follow the natural, easy and fast method of decontaminating your toothbrush. SensiFresh uses a brush-like pattern of silicone heads, housed in a protective holder to capture toothbrush handles of just about any size or shape.  These long, flexible (but durable) silicone finger-like structures easily grab toothbrushes and create an environment that isolates toothbrushes, preventing cross-contamination from other toothbrushes in the holder.                  Other holders are easily exposed to gargled water and toothpaste residue. Leading to the same contamination issues that you were seeking to solve in the first place. The reverse toothbrush holder by Working K using an internal structure of silicon bristles that prevents contamination.      Contacts between toothbrushes can cause unwanted infection.The cup also gets dirty from collected toothbrush water. Our device allows for the separate but concurrent holding of whatever you need: Toothbrushes, razors, toothpaste, tongue cleaner, even a comb without cross-contamination.     Capping a toothbrush or putting it in a container ensures the toothbrush will never dry and worse, can serve as a breeding ground for germs.Inserting toothbrushes upside down (inverted) in the SensiFresh ensures you are getting the fastest, most natural drying and decontamination of toothbrushes after use. The free flow of air, absence of cross-contamination bacteria make the SensiFresh the easiest, most natural way to store and dry your toothbrushes.      SensiFresh is made of easy to sterilize dishwasher safe materials so you can keep it clean.

We believe that making a vehicle to get around the living room and getting new ideas because of shifted perspective will give the kids continuous yet diverse play experiences. Our 2 types of cool wheels will provide just that: Wheels and casters - one's stable, the other's agile The stumbling era is coming to an end - flip over your MODU wheels to add resistance if your toddler wanna go slow & safe.Kids outgrow their toys - especially in their early years when fundamental motor skills are learned. We designed the MODU system to be truly multifunctional. This means that when your kid outgrows one creation, another one is easily built. MODU remains fun and challenging from just 6 months up to 6 years.. ..and beyond! For young infants, MODU in its mere individual elements offers intriguing features, such as tumbling shapes, contrast colors and through-going holes. When reaching the toddler age, i.e. 1-3 years, simple creations like walkers, rockers and rides enable continous fun and stimulating play. After the age of 3, MODU becomes an endless source of inspiration for explorative and imaginative creations. MODU covers the need for several gross motor stimulating toys in a single fun, imaginative and long-lasting product, while encouraging and supporting every stage of your kid's development.Being super age-adaptable MODU is the epitome of sustainable toys – a toy with a long life cycle that stays fun & relevant for years. As we like to say: ""A toy that helps you grow and grows with you."" The MODU blocks consist of tough EVA-foam approved for kids toys. All other parts are made from high-grade ABS plastic - a quality material known from LEGO. Health, safety and environmental impact are key to MODU, so it goes without saying that the parts are 100% phthalate- and BPA-free and have gone through the toughest tests for fumes and toxicity.MODU is made strictly from high-end materialsOur design follows the tradition of Scandinavian toy design, where functionalism is pride of place, and we care deeply about our planet. We produce MODU through two carefully selected toy manufacturers. The facilities and working environment of both partners live up to Danish standards and they are continuously taking initiatives to reduce their environmental footprint.And we are not done yet! In the future we'll keep developing intriguing additions to the MODU ecosystem, and we invite you and your kids to help us decide which new features would be most awesome! In addition to new shapes of blocks, expect cool features like:Thank you for reading all the way to the end. We hope that you’re just as excited about MODU as we   are, and that you’ll join our adventure in creating a world with more fun, imagination and open-ended, active play. We love what we’ve made, and we’re honored to share it with you. For even more info check out our webpage http://www.modutoy.com or join us on the social media.  If you have any questions, or if we can assist you in any way, feel free to shoot an email to our Head of Imaginationland, Jonathan - jonathan@modutoy.com, and he’ll get right back to you. Thank you again, we hope you choose to join us on our journey. Risks and challengesProducts backed and delivered inside the EU are covered with Danish VAT and are subject to no further costs. Please be advised that products shipped outside EU could be subject to local VAT and Taxes. You have to check up with your local regulations in order to get information about this.We already have fully functional prototypes in play that are currently being tested among families, child physiotherapists and kindergardens all over - MODU holds up and they all love it!Manufacturing a product is a fine art and always a complex process. That is why we have teamed up with manufacturers experienced in delivering quality products that are compliant with the strict European standards. Moreover, MODU is continuously being tested at both public and independent consumer labs specialized in toy safety. Our promise to you? Every backer will be treated like our first and everyone will receive a high quality product that they and their kids can enjoy for years. Our estimates for delivery are conservative because we'll take the time to ensure that the quality of MODU is perfect. And although we can’t promise a risk free start, we have done everything in our power to make sure that all the ‘building blocks’ we need to get your MODU kit to your doorstep are there.",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><font color=""#a1a1a1"">(well, it doesn't <i>just</i> make sense... it also makes juice, of course, but you know what we mean)</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a1a1a1""><b>Here's why: </b></font></p>
<p><font color=""#a1a1a1""><b>1 -</b> Mason jars offer a stable juicing experience. Securing Jar Juicer in place with the threaded lid band of the mason jar allows one hand to hold the jar and the other hand to press the orange.</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a1a1a1""><b>2 -</b> Mason jars have measurement lines built right into them. Juicing with Jar Juicer allows you to see exactly how much juice you've squeezed.</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a1a1a1""><b>3 -</b> Mason jars are great for storing fresh juice, and are the storage container of choice for the juicing community. Jar Juicer allows you to juice directly into your storage container.</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a1a1a1""><b>4 -</b> Many people regularly drink out of mason jars. Jar Juicer allows you to juice directly into the glass that you will use to drink out of. </font></p>
<p><font color=""#a1a1a1""><b>5 -</b> Mason jars are durable and portable, making them great for taking beverages on the go. Jar Juicer allows you to turn oranges into juice, just about anywhere.  </font></p>

  - As seen in: 



 
The Juicer for a Jar! 

Jar Juicer works with any wide-mouth mason / canning jar. Simply remove the lid, and replace the inner disc with Jar Juicer. Use the threaded band to secure it in place, and you are ready to start juicing!






 
Two-sided Design
Jar Juicer features a two-sided design, allowing you to juice with one side, then flip it over to drink or pour out of the other, making it ideal for juicing at home or on the go!

Jar Juicer has been engineered to avoid spillage while juicing. It's perfect for most small to mid-sized oranges, and also works great for smaller citrus fruits like lemons or limes! 


Additional Features:

BPA-Free
Dishwasher Safe
Made in Detroit, Michigan, USA
Patent Pending

 

A citrus juicer for a mason jar just makes sense!
(well, it doesn't just make sense... it also makes juice, of course, but you know what we mean)
Here's why: 
1 - Mason jars offer a stable juicing experience. Securing Jar Juicer in place with the threaded lid band of the mason jar allows one hand to hold the jar and the other hand to press the orange.
2 - Mason jars have measurement lines built right into them. Juicing with Jar Juicer allows you to see exactly how much juice you've squeezed.
3 - Mason jars are great for storing fresh juice, and are the storage container of choice for the juicing community. Jar Juicer allows you to juice directly into your storage container.
4 - Many people regularly drink out of mason jars. Jar Juicer allows you to juice directly into the glass that you will use to drink out of. 
5 - Mason jars are durable and portable, making them great for taking beverages on the go. Jar Juicer allows you to turn oranges into juice, just about anywhere.  



Backer Perks













Our Funding Goal

Our goal for this campaign is $5,000. 
This is the absolute minimum that we still need to raise in order to make Jar Juicer a reality. Any additional funds raised will be extremely beneficial to ensuring a smooth and efficient backer fulfillment process, and the ongoing development of our business beyond the campaign.
We have elected a ""Flexible"" funding campaign because if we fall short of the funding goal, we plan to assess all reasonable options for alternatively raising the balance needed. If we are unable to secure the total funds required for production and fulfillment, we promise to return all campaign proceeds to our backers.
Use of Funds
Fabrication of Production Molds
Test Run of Jar Juicers for Quality Assurance 
Production Run of Jar Juicers
Product Packaging 
Shipping / Fulfillment
 
Squeezed in Detroit! 
Jar Juicer is a product of Detroit, Michigan.  As proud supporters of our city and state, we have tried to remain as local as possible throughout the development process.  We intend to further this commitment by partnering with a Detroit-based injection-molded plastics company for all of our production needs. Here's a list of the people and companies that have helped bring Jar Juicer to this point:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>When i was in Liberia, shooting my last documentary, I was taken on an amazing journey by a man named Macintosh. He showed the soul of his hometown, West Point, considered by many the worst shantytown in the Liberian capital of Monrovia. Once you get past the surface we are not so different any of us, there is no sense being scared of other human beings because he had seen the worst of it. Macintosh works with a group of teenage prostitutes, giving them odd jobs, food and occasional floor space in his tiny room, where he lives with his girlfriend and children. He has dreams, one of them is to start an orphanage to get kids off the street, reunify them with their parents and give them some training. Honestly the idea is not fully formed, there needs to be some way of keeping the orphanage sustainable. I am not interested in creating a charity. But until we fully grasp the situation something must be done in the short term to get the girls off the street and fed so that they have the option to live with having to prostitute their bodies and sleep on the cement floor of a video club. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The beginning of the Care for Us orphanage project, this money will get 6-7 girls whom Macintosh works with into two rooms in West Point, feed them and pay our staff in Liberia &lt;Macintosh and our field operative Murba&gt;  for two months while we assess the situation and find the right way to proceed. Macintosh is a certified social worker and has worked in the field with GRS re-unifying street kids in the West Point community with their families. Chid LIberty - the driving force behind Africa's only fair-trade factory located in Liberia, Josh Tetrick - the founder of 33needs&lt;a kickstarter for ngo's&gt; and Katie Meyler - the founder of the More Than Me Foundation that gives scholarships to West Point girls are all on board to find a sustainable solution. This is a direct action, a half way house in every sense of the word, that lays down the ground work for creating a social business to realize Macintosh's Care for Us orphanage project. This money give us the time to get the girls off the street while we make a solid game plan. Katie and Chid will be in Liberia this summer to consult with Macintosh directly.   </p>

From our earliest model we began constructing a high tech solution to a huge problem all over the world. We wanted to make a product where an average user will be able to install our security system anywhere anytime. After many years of trial and error and testing different models we were finally convinced that the current model is the most practical and efficient way to monitor your home, work or anywhere you want.</p><p>We began our partnerships with several factories in China to produce our light bulb cameras and have been testing in our local market for the last year and a half. Aside from the hardware, the most critical part of this system is with the software and app development, which is where we excelled and thrived. We are currently in clinical testing with some of the largest companies in South Korea and also major university campuses all over South Korea. Our feedback has been extraordinary and the not so good feed backs were remedied quickly. We are now ready to start mass production and to start spreading our products all over the world. With your help, I know we can achieve this goal.

Or the light within the camera work independently on the switch with power always running to the camera?A: Electric power must always be on.Electric power is running between 110 ~ 240 volts.Q: What about puck lights with a dimmer? Ok and safe to use with this product?A: Yes you can use puck lights with a dimmer for this camera.We will continuously update the FAQ and answer all of your questions.  Feel free to send us a message or leave a comment.  Thanks!Additional Reference Material (Patents, Trade Shows, Manufacturing Process) Risks and challengesWe have been in development for the last five years from tovnets first concept being in 2011. From our earliest model we began constructing a high tech solution to a huge problem all over the world. We wanted to make a product where an average user will be able to install our security system anywhere anytime. After many years of trial and error and testing different models we were finally convinced that the current model is the most practical and efficient way to monitor your home, work or anywhere you want.We began our partnerships with several factories in China to produce our light bulb cameras and have been testing in our local market for the last year and a half. Aside from the hardware, the most critical part of this system is with the software and app development, which is where we excelled and thrived. We are currently in clinical testing with some of the largest companies in South Korea and also major university campuses all over South Korea. Our feedback has been extraordinary and the not so good feed backs were remedied quickly. We are now ready to start mass production and to start spreading our products all over the world. With your help, I know we can achieve this goal. Thank you for your support!",44.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<p>We know that SULI is very useful for people enjoying the great outdoors and looking to shift to a more sustainable lifestyle, but we also believe that SULI can bring high-quality, sustainable light to those who do not have it.</p>
<p>Turn off your light for 5 seconds and imagine there are 1.5 Billion (almost 1 out of 7) people that do not have access to electricity.</p>
<p>All these people spend their small budget to buy candles and kerosene. Solutions that are not renewable, very toxic and dangerous, causing 1 million deaths every year by intoxication and fires.</p>
<p>Without light kids cannot study longer after school, entrepreneurs cannot be more productive and streets become more dangerous.</p>
<p>Be a part of the solution and help us transform this reality!</p>
<p>SULI is more than a solar lamp. It is a model for social and environmental impact in which all can participate and access solar energy. </p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><b>OUR FIRST SOCIAL PROGRAM: LIGHT FOR BOUTIN, HAITI.</b></p>
<p>Our first project is to deploy SULI modules in Boutín, Haití, in Central America.</p>
<p>Haití is the poorest country in America and only a few years ago it suffered a devastating earthquake. </p>
<p>In Boutín approximately 3,500 people live without access to light or water. Moreover, there are 5 schools in the community and over 800 kids, effectively without access to better opportunities or a dignified life. </p>
<p>To implement this project, we are partnering with AMERICA SOLIDARIA, a highly recognized Chilean non-profit organization with projects all over the American continents, especially in Haiti.</p>
<p>Their project WASH is delivering water to Boutín community, building 5 wells with free access for all. With your support, SULI is joining this initiative by providing light for the wells. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if the support for our campaign is large enough, we will bring SULI light to schools so kids, parents and teachers may have more study hours.</p>
<p>Finally, if the support is amazing - we will install SULIs in the homes of Boutín.</p>
<p>Therefore, we created a <b>SPECIAL PERK</b> for those who can pay a little more to help others with limited economic resources to access the solar light of SULI.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><b>SULI COMMUNITY: THE OPEN-SOURCE MODEL.</b></p>
<p>We want to create a SULI community, allowing us to develop new ideas 
together, through a model open for everybody, where we can inspire 
creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>This way, every user can be a part of our team - designing, creating, building and sharing new ways to use the SULI light.</p>
<p>We believe that the 3D printing world is the future.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434160953/trestwkmvmfuezhq63ok.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><br/></p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><b>EVERY IDEA STARTS WITH A SMALL LIGHT.</b></p>
<p>For years we explored and developed different solar lighting solutions, until we realized we could create a portable solar module, able to be attached and fitted in different ways to change its functionality. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434150825/jm5dcovqrsvo4dmd2mb3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And thus we created SULI - a solar module that charges during the day to shine in the night, adapting itself to a variety of situations.</p>
</div>___________________________________________________________________________

<p><b>HELP US SHINE: CHALLENGES &amp; GOALS.</b></p>
<p>Light is creativity and energy, therefore we are constantly developing new ideas and uses for SULI.</p>
<p>Our goals in the short and mid-term are to start our first massive production in China, then with your collaboration and feedback we can start the second stage of product development that will allow us to add amazing features such as a USB PORT to charge smartphones.</p>
<p>We want SULI to be even smarter than today, adding a BLUETOOTH that allows it to connect to a smartphone app and be controlled at distance, or putting many SULIs together, creating a big system that can shine even brighter and light up bigger spaces.</p>
<p>But today, our main goal is to make SULI a solution that can be within everybody´s reach. Help us spread the word and reach as many people as possible.</p>

<p><b>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</b></p>
<p>We need the world to know SULI. Because we believe it can change the way we use light.</p>
<p>We need your support to complete the first batch production of SULI. </p>
<p>We want to produce at least 500 units, and to have the manufacturing platform ready for massive production. The more support we receive, the lower the cost of production would be, enabling us to bring this light to those in most need.</p>

MEET SULI





The world’s first solar module for everyone.

The light of the sun is everywhere, it belongs to all, but only a few have the means to transform it into usable energy for our daily life.
SULI is a portable solar module that will change this reality, democratizing access to light for everybody. It´s PATENT PENDING (2014-001840)


Empowering people.




By mixing sustainable solar energy with the power of the 3D printing world.




Join the revolution, be part of the change you want in the world and help us to achieve our next big goal: Start our first massive production.

WE NEED YOU.
___________________________________________________________________________
SULI IN THE PRESS






___________________________________________________________________________
TECHNICAL DETAILS


___________________________________________________________________________
WHAT OUR PARTNERS ARE TALKING ABOUT SULI
And why you should support us...

___________________________________________________________________________
LIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE: ONE MODULE FOR DIFFERENT NEEDS.
SULI is portable, multi-functional, and can be adapted to different uses in everyday life through its double fitting: a PET bottle fitting and a 3D printable accessories fitting.




___________________________________________________________________________
HOW IT WORKS: LIGHT YOUR BIKE, YOUR WORK, YOUR LIFE... ONE 3D PRINT AT A TIME.
SULI modular system adapts to different accessories or to PET bottles in a easy way:

 

To a PET bottle:

For hanging:

To a window:




___________________________________________________________________________
OUR OBJECTIVE: MASSIFY AND DEMOCRATIZE THE EVERYDAY USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY.





We know that SULI is very useful for people enjoying the great outdoors and looking to shift to a more sustainable lifestyle, but we also believe that SULI can bring high-quality, sustainable light to those who do not have it.
Turn off your light for 5 seconds and imagine there are 1.5 Billion (almost 1 out of 7) people that do not have access to electricity.
All these people spend their small budget to buy candles and kerosene. Solutions that are not renewable, very toxic and dangerous, causing 1 million deaths every year by intoxication and fires.
Without light kids cannot study longer after school, entrepreneurs cannot be more productive and streets become more dangerous.
Be a part of the solution and help us transform this reality!
SULI is more than a solar lamp. It is a model for social and environmental impact in which all can participate and access solar energy. 
___________________________________________________________________________
OUR FIRST SOCIAL PROGRAM: LIGHT FOR BOUTIN, HAITI.
Our first project is to deploy SULI modules in Boutín, Haití, in Central America.
Haití is the poorest country in America and only a few years ago it suffered a devastating earthquake. 
In Boutín approximately 3,500 people live without access to light or water. Moreover, there are 5 schools in the community and over 800 kids, effectively without access to better opportunities or a dignified life. 
To implement this project, we are partnering with AMERICA SOLIDARIA, a highly recognized Chilean non-profit organization with projects all over the American continents, especially in Haiti.
Their project WASH is delivering water to Boutín community, building 5 wells with free access for all. With your support, SULI is joining this initiative by providing light for the wells. 
Furthermore, if the support for our campaign is large enough, we will bring SULI light to schools so kids, parents and teachers may have more study hours.
Finally, if the support is amazing - we will install SULIs in the homes of Boutín.
Therefore, we created a SPECIAL PERK for those who can pay a little more to help others with limited economic resources to access the solar light of SULI.





___________________________________________________________________________
SULI COMMUNITY: THE OPEN-SOURCE MODEL.
We want to create a SULI community, allowing us to develop new ideas 
together, through a model open for everybody, where we can inspire 
creativity and innovation.
This way, every user can be a part of our team - designing, creating, building and sharing new ways to use the SULI light.
We believe that the 3D printing world is the future.

 


___________________________________________________________________________

EVERY IDEA STARTS WITH A SMALL LIGHT.
For years we explored and developed different solar lighting solutions, until we realized we could create a portable solar module, able to be attached and fitted in different ways to change its functionality. 

And thus we created SULI - a solar module that charges during the day to shine in the night, adapting itself to a variety of situations.
___________________________________________________________________________

HELP US SHINE: CHALLENGES & GOALS.
Light is creativity and energy, therefore we are constantly developing new ideas and uses for SULI.
Our goals in the short and mid-term are to start our first massive production in China, then with your collaboration and feedback we can start the second stage of product development that will allow us to add amazing features such as a USB PORT to charge smartphones.
We want SULI to be even smarter than today, adding a BLUETOOTH that allows it to connect to a smartphone app and be controlled at distance, or putting many SULIs together, creating a big system that can shine even brighter and light up bigger spaces.
But today, our main goal is to make SULI a solution that can be within everybody´s reach. Help us spread the word and reach as many people as possible.




____________________________________________________________________________
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
We need the world to know SULI. Because we believe it can change the way we use light.
We need your support to complete the first batch production of SULI. 
We want to produce at least 500 units, and to have the manufacturing platform ready for massive production. The more support we receive, the lower the cost of production would be, enabling us to bring this light to those in most need.



___________________________________________________________________________
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR
In 2013 and 2014 we have been focused on developing and finishing the SULI module, also defining our vision and mission. 
This year we have been awarded with grants from Innova Chile of CORFO  through the Chrysalis incubator, which continues to support us in developing our business strategy.
We are also very proud to be part of the 2015 class of AGORA PARTNERSHIPS ACCELERATOR, an international nonprofit organization that supports social entrepreneurs in Latin America. 
With their help we are developing our model of social impact and our next steps as a social company.
We have been supported also by the IDB (InterAmerican Development Bank) to be part of the 2015 class of Agora Partnerships.





We have an alliance with America Solidaria, a nonprofit organization committed to social impact by helping vulnerable people throughout America, with projects in areas such as health, education and social development.
We also have an alliance with FabLab Santiago, a laboratory focused on experimentation in industrial development and new technologies. They are our hands and brain to develop the open-source platform and manufacture accessories using 3D printers.


We feel very proud of what we have accomplished so far, but we know it's just the beginning.

___________________________________________________________________________
OUR COMMITMENT: FOCUSING ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
SULILAB (Sun Light Laboratory) is a company that seeks to implement the best practices in every field (social, environmental, human). 
In the short time of its existence, SULI has already received the B  Pending Corporation seal of approval, which guarantees our social commitment.
B Corporations redefine their commercial success in delivering solutions to social and environmental problems. To do this, they incorporate a commitment to generating a positive impact, operating under high standards of performance and transparency.
We continue to work towards eventually becoming a certified B Corporation, and therefore, part of the global community with the highest levels of social responsibility.
Our latest partner is Acera, the Chilean Asociation of Renewables Energies.

___________________________________________________________________________
OUR TEAM: THE SPIRIT OF SULI.

We believe our team is the key to today's and future success - passionate, motivated and full of ideas to create something truly meaningful. We come from diverse backgrounds, with deep experience in fields such as light design, social innovation, open-source models, production and marketing.

SULI LAB social company's first steps come from 2013, when the Chilean light company LUXIA, together with MICROLÓGICA INNOVACIÓN, a Chilean company committed to the development and manufacturing of technological products, decided to create a new light solution. 
In 2014 two amazing resources joined to complete the team: first RAYA, an expert agency in digital marketing, voted the best agency in Chile on 2014, and then CRISTIÁN O´RYAN, a social entrepreneur and passionate social innovator, former COO at Desafío Levantemos Chile, one of the 3 top nonprofit organization in Chile.





___________________________________________________________________________
REWARDS: A PROJECT THAT CAN SHINE WITH YOUR SUPPORT.


Today, SULI is a dream that is about to come true. We want everybody to have access to the energy of the sun and to be able to begin a shift to a more sustainable way of life.
Because with SULI you can illuminate your path, your home, your garden, and places and lives of many where electricity is a privilege.
SUPPORT US & THE CLEAN ENERGY OF SULI!

 menos 500 unidades, para poder tener todas las piezas listas para una 
producción masiva. Mientras mayor sea el apoyo, podremos
producir SULI a un precio menor, y de esta forma llegar a quienes no 
tienen acceso a luz.


Además, este primer impulso y
producción nos va a ayudar a seguir con las próximas etapas y desarrollos.

____________________________________________________________________________LO QUE HEMOS LOGRADO HASTA AHORADurante el 2013 y 2014 nos hemos dedicado a desarrollar y
terminar el producto SULI, y armar nuestra visión y misión del producto. 
Este año recibimos fondos de Innova Chile  de Corfo a través de la incubadora  Chrysalis , quienes nos apoyan
constantemente en mejorar nuestro plan de negocios. 
Además somos parte de la clase 2015 de AGORA PARTNERSHIPS ACCELERATOR,
 una organización  sin fines de lucro que apoya a emprendedores
sociales en América Latina con oficinas en Nicaragua, Washington y el 
Distrito Federal. 
Junto a ellos estamos desarrollando nuestro plan de 
impacto social el
cual también ha tenido el apoyo del BID
(Banco Interamericano del Desarrollo). 

CON FOCO EN EL DESARROLLO SOCIAL

Suli quiere ser una empresa que aspira siempre a tener las mejores 
prácticas, en todo ámbito (social, mediambiental, humano). En poco 
tiempo de vida, ya hemos recibido el Sello B Pendiente, lo que garantiza
 nuestro compromiso.
Las empresas
B, redefinen su éxito comercial en la entrega de soluciones a problemas
sociales y ambientales. Para ello, incorporan el compromiso de generar impactos
positivos, operando con altos estándares de desempeño y transparencia
Seguimos trabajando para lograr,
finalmente, convertirnos en una Empresa B certificada, y por ende, formar parte
de la comunidad con el más alto nivel de empresas socialmente responsables.
Hemos hecho una alianza con  America Solidaria,
 ONG que se involucra con las comunidades más vulnerables del 
continente,
a través de proyectos de salud, educación y desarrollo económico 
familiar. Con ellos realizaremos nuestro primer proyecto de IMPACTO 
SOCIAL.


También tenemos una alianza con FabLab Santiago, que es un laboratorio de experimentación  en el área industrial y de nuevas tecnologías
con ellos desarrollaremos y fabricaremos las plataformas Open Source de
accesorios. 
Nuestra más reciente alianza corresponde a Acera, Asociación Chilena de Energías Renovables.___________________________________________________________________________NUESTRO EQUIPOSomos un equipo interdisciplinario, motivado y lleno de nuevas ideas.SULI es una iniciativa que parte de la empresa chilena de iluminación LUXIA, junto con MICROLÓGICA INNOVACIÓN, empresa chilena dedicada al desarollo y manufactura de productos de tecnología. El 2014 se sumaron dos grandes aportes, RAYA,
 empresa experta en comunicación digital, y CRISTIÁN O´RYAN, quien tiene
 mucha experiencia en el trabajo con ONGs en proyectos sociales.
____________________________________________________________________________RECOMPENSAS: UN PROYECTO QUE PUEDE BRILLAR CON TU AYUDAHoy,
 SULI es un sueño que está a punto de ser realidad. Queremos que todos 
puedan acceder a la energía del sol y a una vida sustentable. Porque con

<p>We have created an international team coming from different countries – Estonia, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, China, etc. The Internet enabled us to bring together great engineers, software developers, designers and translators to make the kind of VPN that we would like to use ourselves – without complicated settings, without any restrictions on the number and type of devices, without speed losses, without anything that may seem unnecessary. A VPN that you just need to switch on in order to feel free and secure. This is available to anyone, even to those who seem to know little about computer technologies.</p>
<p>In some of the countries where we live there exist Internet restrictions and censorship, so we managed to get to know all the leading VPN-servers well before we started making our own one.</p>
<p>IncogniTeam Company is registered in Estonia – a comfortable European country, hospitable to IT-projects. To bring our ideas to life we invited as a Managing Director a man having a wealth of experience in carrying out similar projects – the development and production of internet devices for different applications. It was of particular importance for us that he should know the process of internet connection not only from the point of view of the end-user or someone who knows the device (router), but also from the point of view of the internet-provider – it would be difficult for us to do so without it.</p>
<p>We started with the development of a stationary, home version of the VPN-router IncognIt.Home. It has already gone into production and it will be on sale in January, 2016. But you can <a href=""https://www.incogniteam.com/en/pre-order.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #008acf;"" target=""_blank"">place a free pre-order</a> now and get a 10% discount.</p>
<p>However, reading the very first comments of our would-be users, we understood that people need privacy and security everywhere, wherever they might be. Moreover, out of home – connecting via open public networks in a café, hotel, in another country – and you can’t do this without VPN. So we started the development of the compact router IncognIt.Travel version that we’re introducing here.</p>

A VPN that you just need to switch on in order to feel free and secure. This is available to anyone, even to those who seem to know little about computer technologies.
In some of the countries where we live there exist Internet restrictions and censorship, so we managed to get to know all the leading VPN-servers well before we started making our own one.
IncogniTeam Company is registered in Estonia – a comfortable European country, hospitable to IT-projects. To bring our ideas to life we invited as a Managing Director a man having a wealth of experience in carrying out similar projects – the development and production of internet devices for different applications. It was of particular importance for us that he should know the process of internet connection not only from the point of view of the end-user or someone who knows the device (router), but also from the point of view of the internet-provider – it would be difficult for us to do so without it.
We started with the development of a stationary, home version of the VPN-router IncognIt.Home. It has already gone into production and it will be on sale in January, 2016. But you can place a free pre-order now and get a 10% discount.
However, reading the very first comments of our would-be users, we understood that people need privacy and security everywhere, wherever they might be. Moreover, out of home – connecting via open public networks in a café, hotel, in another country – and you can’t do this without VPN. So we started the development of the compact router IncognIt.Travel version that we’re introducing here.

They usually follow the same routine. Whenever you throw a party or have a small gathering, you never want it to be boring. You want to be known to host a good time. However, it’s often challenging to find new ways to jazz up the night - without going too crazy of course.Because it’s unlike any other and it’s made for parties, it’s sure to be an experience that people will enjoy and remember.  You won’t find another liquor decanter like this. ShotsClub comes with 2 gun decanters made of thick quality glass, a holster to handle each gun, 8 traditional shot glasses, and a durable case with protective padding.Just add your favorite whiskey and it’s everything you need for a good time. Showing up to a party with ShotsClub is greater than showing up to a party with chips or a 6-pack.With ShotsClub, you’re showing up with an experience to offer. Sometimes it isn’t enough to just go to a party, show up and be the party! The briefcase alone hints to the crowd that the party is about to be taken to the next level. So when you open it up and show off your guns, everyone will surely want to be a part of the fun that you have to offer!Take ShotsClub to your next house party, tailgate party, or even a chill kickback. It has everything you need and it’s always ready to go. ShotsClub is truly a great gift - for yourself, your friend, or a family member who really appreciates his whiskey. You don’t even have to wrap it. It’s ready to go as is. And when it’s used at a party or a gathering, share the fun experiences with those in your circle.Everyone has their own hobbies and interests. For some it’s gun collecting, for others is whiskey. But we all share the interest of sharing our interests. Where’s the fun in collecting whiskey if you aren’t going to share those experiences with others. ShotsClub merges all of these hobbies so that you can create unique and fun times.Share a part of yourself with your family and friends all over some great convo and some great whiskey. After all, life is too short not to.  I’m ready to make ShotsClub a reality. This is the last step to bring it into the marketplace. With your support, we can bring ShotsClub into the party scene and help get the party started.",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Sailors who transported coffee to Europe had devised a lot of methods to enjoy coffee during their long-term sailing. One of those methods was Dutch coffee which is also called Japanese-style slow drip iced coffee. Dripping coffee with cold water makes coffee less bitter and sweeter with unique taste and flavor through ripening over time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Cold Brew Coffee is distinctive in that you don’t extract coffee by dripping water drop by drop but extract cold brew coffee in refrigeration. So you can enjoy oily taste and rich flavor that you cannot have from Dutch coffee.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Cold brew coffee has a lot of characteristics different from those of coffee with hot water dripping. Cold brew coffee is made of coffee beans ground into particles of a size similar to that of grain sugar in an extractor and then mixed with water at the room temperature for cold storage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A combination of ground coffee beans and room temperature water causes chemical reaction to extract elements that produce taste and flavor of coffee. Coffee extracted with hot water has full body and stronger flavor with bitter and and sour taste than cold brew coffee.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Cold brew coffee is less bitter and sour but sweeter and oilier and is available for cold storage for 2 to 4 weeks and its taste and flavor last long.</p>

You may easily make cold brew coffee with My Cold Brew and now you can use cold brew coffee to make nitro coffee with creamy texture of black beer.  Nitro King is based on a motif of a lion, the king of animals, meaning that Nitro King will be the world’s best nitro coffee maker.Nitro King is not something that is mass produced in a factory just like glass or stationery.Nitro King is an assembly of 4 respective parts produced from 4 different manufacturers. Our Nitro King focuses on 2 of these 4 parts. It is similar to other product  that it has a keg but Nitro King has a premium stout faucet with creamy plate and coffee spear newly developed that combines nitro gas. The difference in performance of those parts lead to a totally different product. And the actual appearance will also differ. Therefore there might be no other one with the same structure and functions as Nitro King.The essence of Nitro King is a coffee spear that connects the stainless steel body to the faucet.The stout faucet used in Nitro King is equipped with a creamy plate that produces rich cream with texture of black beer, offering an optimized design to make nitro coffee with quality taste.Creamy plate is a device that facilitate bubble generation when extracting nitro cold brew coffee.Nitro King was intended for users to make nitro coffee with a small amount of gas unlike the ones in existing coffeehouses.Nitro King is a nitro coffee maker that you can use at home and it was intended for users to make nitro coffee with a small amount of gas unlike the ones in existing coffeehouses.We have planned the production of Nitro King with an intention to make more people enjoy nitro coffee at home.

Pour the cold brew coffee into the main body of Nitro King.
Combine the handle with the faucet and then assemble them with the coffee spear to combine with the main body.

Put the nitrogen gas into the cartridge shell.
Combine the cartridge shell with the coffee spear of Nitro King. 
Fix it to the spiral line and then rotate it until you hear a sound like blowing off from a bicycle tire.

Shake it so that the cold brew coffee can be fully mixed with nitrogen and leave it to be ripe for 1 hour. 
Place the glass to the nozzle and then pull the handle to the front slowly.
 
When you put the nitrogen gas into the cartridge shell and rotate it, you will hear ‘whistle’ sound. Rotate it until the sound stops. Do not exercise too much force to rotate it.  
Where only nitrogen is discharged due to lack of coffee, when extracting the nitro coffee, pull the handle grip to the front to completely remove the nitrogen gas
   Cascading : Bubbles that sink like a small waterfall and then rise again


 

 
When you extract nitro coffee, you can see cascading like a waterfall that rises again. Soft but rich flavor will make you experience a whole new world of iced coffee.   We cannot provide nitrogen gas as it is prohibited on the plane. You may purchase it on online markets such as Amazon.com or eBay. And you can also find it in your local coffee goods stores.     
Sailors who transported coffee to Europe had devised a lot of methods to enjoy coffee during their long-term sailing. One of those methods was Dutch coffee which is also called Japanese-style slow drip iced coffee. Dripping coffee with cold water makes coffee less bitter and sweeter with unique taste and flavor through ripening over time.
Cold Brew Coffee is distinctive in that you don’t extract coffee by dripping water drop by drop but extract cold brew coffee in refrigeration. So you can enjoy oily taste and rich flavor that you cannot have from Dutch coffee.
 

 

Cold brew coffee has a lot of characteristics different from those of coffee with hot water dripping. Cold brew coffee is made of coffee beans ground into particles of a size similar to that of grain sugar in an extractor and then mixed with water at the room temperature for cold storage.
A combination of ground coffee beans and room temperature water causes chemical reaction to extract elements that produce taste and flavor of coffee. Coffee extracted with hot water has full body and stronger flavor with bitter and and sour taste than cold brew coffee.
Cold brew coffee is less bitter and sour but sweeter and oilier and is available for cold storage for 2 to 4 weeks and its taste and flavor last long.

No small feat in a category that hasn’t been updated since the ‘80’s.In short, it’s everything you need for a cozier bedroom vibe.   Open your eyes not your emailWhat’s equally important though, is everything Loftie doesn’t do: Connect to your email, apps, and social media, and all the anxiety they bring along.  That’s because, while most of us default to our smartphone’s alarm, research shows that removing technology from the bedroom is one of the best ways to enhance sleep length and quality. Sounds dreamy, no?  A better sleep, by design Loftie is the most intuitive and reliable alarm clock in the world, from the texture of its buttons to the light of its display to the sounds that put you to sleep and wake you up. Let’s dive under the covers for a look at the features.  Everything you need, nothing you don’t Quality analog feel, timeless form, and thoughtful technology come together in a clock you’ll be proud to have on your nightstand.  Wake up, sleepyheadOur two-phase alarm system was designed for the way humans actually wake up: In two distinct stages. The first sound gently lulls you out of your slumber while the second gets you out of bed and into your day.  The bed signal A warm glow from from the built-in nightlight signals it’s time to start thinking about drifting off.  Shhhhh…..Meditations, Sound baths, and Breathwork. Unique content from the best instructors out there, now available on your nightstand—no phone required. Plus: Storytime is back and it’s going to knock your slippers off.  Sounds for sound sleepScientifically calibrated white, brown, and pink noises (plus nature sounds, naturally) to lull you to sleep and keep you there. They fade out before your alarm goes off so your brain doesn’t get mixed messages.  No app necessaryBut there’s a great one if you want it—available for both iOS and Android. Set your alarm remotely. Schedule multiple alarms or alarms that vary day-by-day. Plus, you can pre-select one of your own playlists to make winding down even easier. The Science“But I love my smartphone, what’s wrong with having it next to my bed?” you ask.The short answer? Science. (The longer answer is also science). Think about it this way: Daytime technology is bad for the bedtime brain, whether we're quarantined or not. Why?
We scroll when we should be sleeping.
The stuff we look at makes us feel awake and alert when our brains and bodies are begging for rest.
The blue light from our phones tells our brain not to make melatonin (the hormone that tells your body it's time to go to sleep). See you at 3 AM. 
Then, when it comes to waking up, smartphones do us harm again. We're hit with a barrage of outside stressors right as we tune into consciousness. Studies show that leaving our phones outside the bedroom makes us happier—and more likely to maintain healthy phone behaviors throughout the day. We are creatures of habit after all—and when we remove temptation from our environment, it makes it easier for us to change our behavior. Not convinced? Check out this super interesting study about the effects smartphones have on social interaction and focus. TLDR: Just having the phone in our sight makes us less capable of having a linear conversation or finishing a task. Going to bed and waking up included. In case it's not clear: We are strongly recommending you to stop using your phone as an alarm clock. But don’t worry, this bedtime story does not end with you having to get rid of it entirely. It does, however, encourage you (nudge nudge) to get a Loftie, and get back to sleeping and waking, well, like a human.  A Quick Recap Let's all just go back to sleepFor that to happen, though, we need your help. We’ve done research, prototyping, iterating, more research, more prototyping.    We’ve partnered with DorisDev, the brilliant product development minds behind Great Jones, by Humankind, and Judy (humble brag). We’re currently working on a phase called ‘engineering validation testing.’ And now...drum roll....we’re ready for production. In short, this is where the head hits the pillow. Your purchase on Indiegogo is critical to delivering this product, and better sleep, to the world.  Dreams > ScreensLots of things can go haywire in the bedroom, especially during chaotic times like these.Your sleep shouldn’t be one of them. Let’s unplug, unwind, and remember what waking from a good night’s rest feels like. Who knows, with your help, we could just create next best thing to rising with the sun.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Don Munro CEO, Efergy Technologies</h4>
<p>'My brother and I work together developing energy monitoring products in China. This year whilst home alone in Scotland, our 75 year old mum fell and broke her collarbone and dislocated her shoulder and it took her a while to get in touch with anyone. After the shock of this we looked around for a product that would allow us to keep an eye on her in future and make sure she was safe. We couldn't find one so we thought we would develop it...</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449823654/edzupw2mtfic8igtcymv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>'We started on this project early this year and have been working with a hardware developer in China and are now confident we have the hardware solution. We're looking for help to fund the development of the app and also want to get the idea of the Carehub out there.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to us as we think this device could give peace of mind to many people who are in similar situations to us.'</p>

<p>We've developed energy monitoring products for the last 9 years, so we have the experience in developing this type of technology.</p>
<p>We have a proven track record in developing energy monitoring products and have sold over 1.2m online energy monitoring products. We have experienced and qualified personnel and a distribution network ready for this product but believe the market for this is far wider than our energy monitoring products.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<div>The biggest challenge is to get the development of this product finished/tested and  onto the market.  We're 75% developed with the hardware and the app has been designed and is ready to be developed. </div>
<div>With your help we can speed-up this process and bring the Carehub to market sooner.</div>

<h2>The future plans</h2>

<div>We've already got big plans for the Carehub. Once this campaign is over we have a 2nd stage development plan. This plan will integrate more features and hardware to suit the Carehub's primary functions.</div>
<div>We'll let you into a few of our future plans for this product:</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>Wearable Push-to-Call wrist band</b><br/>It'll be even easier for the elderly to call the app. We're planning to develop a wristband with a simple BlueTooth push button that will activate the call feature. This way a call can be started from the comfort of an armchair.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>Wearable Alert Button</b><br/>If an elderly relative is in an emergency situation we want to develop a wearable alert button that will notify an 'alarm alert' when pressed, we're even looking at to do this with two-way comms from the wearable.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>Wearable Health Checker</b><br/>Want to keep an eye on your mum's blood pressure and other vital health stats? We're looking at some high quality health wearables that could give you daily reports of the health stats and alert you if something isn't right.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Please note these developments are being considered for the next stage of the development and aren't included in this campaign perk level. </div>

The Carehub is a communication device that contains sensors to alert you of issues that could affect your elderly relatives. 



We've developed a hardware prototype for this product, now we need to take it to the next level.















 
Two Way Communication: 

How many times have you tried to teach your parents to use
Skype or FaceTime for a two way call…and failed?
With the Carehub it couldn’t be easier, mum presses the button
on the top of the unit and calls straight through to the app. 



You pick up and
choose to have a video or an audio call...no fiddly tech for
grandma to figure out.

Carehub in the news







Motion/ Non-Motion Alert: 
Do you want an alert in the morning when mum gets up and makes breakfast? Or more importantly, do you want an alert if she doesn’t get up and trigger the motion sensors
before 10am?







Critical Temperature Alert: 

In
many countries, elderly people run a serious risk of illness or worse because
their homes reach a critical temperature as they generally tolerate the
conditions to save money on their energy bills.  

The
Carehub can be set to alert you if your parent’s home has reached to a critical
temperature so you can act quickly.






Reminder
Alerts: 


The Carehub has this cool little feature to make sure your folks
never forget those important things again...




You can record an audio message from your smartphone and set the times and days when this message should activate on the Carehub device.  There will be an audible beep from the Carehub and the LED will flash purple. Mum presses the button on the top of the device to listen to the reminder message.

Motion Activated Nightlight: 
To minimize the risk of night-time accidents the Carehub has a nightlight which is activated from the
motion detector.





Local TF Card Storage: 

A lot of people have concerns over remote storage of home images. Many other cameras on the market use cloud storage video images and charge extra for subscribing for this. We keep it simple, the Carehub has local storage on a TF card which can be retrieved locally.




You can also capture images and video from the Carehub locally in your smartphone photo/video gallery.




What's the Backstory? 

Don Munro CEO, Efergy Technologies
'My brother and I work together developing energy monitoring products in China. This year whilst home alone in Scotland, our 75 year old mum fell and broke her collarbone and dislocated her shoulder and it took her a while to get in touch with anyone. After the shock of this we looked around for a product that would allow us to keep an eye on her in future and make sure she was safe. We couldn't find one so we thought we would develop it...


'We started on this project early this year and have been working with a hardware developer in China and are now confident we have the hardware solution. We're looking for help to fund the development of the app and also want to get the idea of the Carehub out there.
This campaign is important to us as we think this device could give peace of mind to many people who are in similar situations to us.'


The HardwareThe Carehub device is packed with sensors and hardware to give benefits to the elderly user...








The App

Here's an overview of how the Carehub device and app interact:


 



How does the Carehub shape up to it's competition?
We're confident that the Carehub contains more unique selling features than any other device/app on the market. Here's why....






 Why do we need you?


We're looking for $25,000 to make the Carehub a reality, we've already developed the hardware prototype, we need extra funding to:

Hardware tooling for mass production
Software development (Android & iOS)
Certification for CE/FCC/RCM


Budget calculation

Tooling for mass production: $10,000
Software development (Android & iOS): $8,000
Certification for CE/FCC/RCM: $7,000
Total: $25,000

You are vital to this campaign, with your support we can reach our goals.


Timeline








What's in it for you?

We have some great perks for anyone who supports this campaign. Everything from updates to office-dates! In between there are some great discounts available on the Carehub for early adopters.






   
Our Company
We've developed energy monitoring products for the last 9 years, so we have the experience in developing this type of technology.
We have a proven track record in developing energy monitoring products and have sold over 1.2m online energy monitoring products. We have experienced and qualified personnel and a distribution network ready for this product but believe the market for this is far wider than our energy monitoring products.
For more information on Efergy Technologies click here   
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge is to get the development of this product finished/tested and  onto the market.  We're 75% developed with the hardware and the app has been designed and is ready to be developed. 
With your help we can speed-up this process and bring the Carehub to market sooner.


The future plans

We've already got big plans for the Carehub. Once this campaign is over we have a 2nd stage development plan. This plan will integrate more features and hardware to suit the Carehub's primary functions.
We'll let you into a few of our future plans for this product:


Wearable Push-to-Call wrist bandIt'll be even easier for the elderly to call the app. We're planning to develop a wristband with a simple BlueTooth push button that will activate the call feature. This way a call can be started from the comfort of an armchair.


Wearable Alert ButtonIf an elderly relative is in an emergency situation we want to develop a wearable alert button that will notify an 'alarm alert' when pressed, we're even looking at to do this with two-way comms from the wearable.


Wearable Health CheckerWant to keep an eye on your mum's blood pressure and other vital health stats? We're looking at some high quality health wearables that could give you daily reports of the health stats and alert you if something isn't right.

Please note these developments are being considered for the next stage of the development and aren't included in this campaign perk level. 


How to convince your parents about the Carehub?
We know that you want to take care and monitor your parents but they might have some worries about being remotely monitored. With the help of the people at Assisted Living CT, we've put together a guide on how to approach the subject.
Click here to get some tips.
                              FAQs
I hope we've covered everything here, if you're looking for more information please check out the frequently asked question document here.


Any ideas for the Carehub?
We want your suggestions! The Carehub is for people like you, please feel free to message us any suggestions you may have. All suggestions will be added to future development proposals.

El Carehub es un dispositivo de comunicación que sirve para facilitar una comunicación más efectiva entre personas mayores y su familia. El Carehub también incluye diferentes tipos de sensores de forma que ayudan a prevenir riesgos de accidente y salud. 

Contamos con el apoyo de:




 A la fecha de hoy, ya tenemos un prototipo pero ahora necesitamos dar el siguiente paso.















 
 Comunicación de voz bidireccional: 

 ¿Cuántas veces has tratado de enseñar a tus padres cómo utilizar Skype?
 Pues con el Carehub es muy fácil. Con simplemente apretar el botón de la parte superior del Carehub se establece una llamada que la recibe el App de tu móvil. 



 A través del App tú decides si quieres aceptar y tener una conversación de voz o de video... ¡se acabaron las tediosas lecciones de tecnología!





 Alerta de movimiento y de ""no-movimiento"": 
 ¿Quieres que te notifiquemos cuando papá se levanta por la mañana? O quizás te resulta más útil una notificación que te alerte de lo contrario, cuando no ha habido movimiento. El Carehub incluye ambas opciones.







 Alerta de temperatura crítica: 

 Los más mayores a veces corren el riesgo de enfermarse porque sus hogares están por encima o por debajo de ciertas temperaturas que denominamos críticas. Esto es más frecuente en las personas mayores porque pueden perder la sensibilidad de la temperatura pero también porque aceptan estas condiciones a cambio de ahorrar en la factura de la luz.  

 Puedes configurar tu Carehub para que te envíe esta alerta cuando tú así lo desees. De esta forma tú puedes actuar de forma inmediata y prevenir riesgos de enfermedad.






Recordatorios y mensajes de voz programados: 


 El Carehub incluye esta función para que tus padres no se olviden de cosas importantes...






 Puedes grabar un mensaje de voz desde tu teléfono móvil y programarlo para que suene cuando tú quieras. En el momento programado el Carehub hará sonar un pitido (también mostrará una luz LED de color morado) y mamá entonces, apretando el boton del carehub, podrá escuchar tu mensaje.

 Luz de noche: 
 El Carehub se puede programar para que active una luz cuando hay movimiento por la noche. Esto sirve para minimizar el riesgo de accidentes por la noche.





Tarjeta de memoria: 

Hoy en día, son muchos los que se preocupan sobre el almacenaje remoto de videos domésticos. Otras cámaras en el mercado utilizan sistemas de memoria en la nube y cargan una subscripción a cambio. Nosotros hemos preferido mantener un sistema sencillo donde la información queda grabada solamente de forma local en la tarjeta de memoria.






Puedes también guardar imágenes y videos en tu smartphone desde el Carehub.




¿Cómo surge esta idea? 

Don Munro, Gerente Efergy Technologies
“Mi hermano y yo trabajamos juntos desarrollando productos de monitorización energética en China. Hace poco, nuestra madre de 75 años tuvo una caída y se fracturó la clavícula además de dislocarse un hombro; ya que vive sola en Escocia, se le hizo difícil contactar por ayuda de inmediato. Superado el shock de esta experiencia, comenzamos a buscar productos que nos permitiesen estar pendiente de ella en el futuro y darnos tranquilidad. No encontramos nada y por tanto se nos ocurrió que lo podíamos desarrollar nosotros mismos...""


""Empezamos este proyecto a principios de este año. Hemos trabajado con la ayuda de un diseñador de producto y ahora ya tenemos una solución de hardware. Buscamos ayuda para financiar el desarrollo del App y también queremos promover la ideal del producto."" 
""Esta campaña es importante para nosotros porque creemos que podría ayudar a muchas personas que están en una situación parecida a la nuestra""


El Hardware El dispositivo Carehub incluye una serie de sensores y actuadores que sirven para dar un servicio y valor añadido a personas mayores y sus familiares.








La aplicación
A continuación una breve reseña de como interactúan el Carehub y la aplicación:








¿Cómo nos vemos respecto de la competencia?
El Carehub tiene particularidades únicas y estamos muy confiados de que es superior al resto de dispositivos y aplicaciones en el mercado. A continuación os explicamos por qué:

<li>Independently from whether you use Bluetooth or WiFi, Remootio uses <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>256 bit authenticated end-to-end encryption </strong>between your smartphone and the Remootio device</span>
</li>
<li>
<font>From the Remootio app you have full control over how your smartphone connects to your Remootio device. You can choose from three options:</font><ul>
<li>
<font>​<strong>Bluetooth</strong>: in this mode Remootio only uses its Bluetooth module. No data goes through your WiFi network in this mode.</font> On top of the standard Bluetooth security, the authenticated <font>256 bit end-to-end encryption ensures security in this mode.</font>
</li>
<li><font><strong>Home WiFi</strong>: in this mode Remootio only uses its WiFi module without Bluetooth. No data goes through the internet. All data remains within your home WiFi network.<br/>The authenticated 256 bit end-to-end encryption also ensures security in this mode.</font></li>
<li><font><strong>Internet</strong>: in this mode Remootio is connected to the internet via WiFi. On top of the industry standard SSL connection, the authenticated 256 bit end-to-end encryption guarantees security in this mode. We have created a one-click-setup-environment for setting up the internet connectivity (recommended for most users), but if you are an experienced user you can also define the internet address of your device in the App to setup a peer-to-peer connection.</font></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Keys </strong>are generated during setup and are only stored on your smartphone and the Remootio device itself. Your keys are not stored anywhere else.</li>
<li>Even the <strong>setup process is protected against hackers</strong> trying to get your virtual keys as it uses the highly secure, state-of-the-art Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, which together with the additional certificate validation and digital signature scheme, is<strong> resistant to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle and other attacks.</strong>
</li>
<li>Remootio, unlike other gate controllers, is <strong>not cloud-based</strong>, so your security does not depend on a third party (such as a cloud service provider)</li>
<li>Any time your smartphone sends a request to the Remootio device, it sends a unique mathematical problem back to the smartphone which it can only solve using the key the two devices agreed on during setup. Since this mathematical problem is always different, signals for two opening cycles are never the same, therefore Remootio is <strong>protected against replay attacks</strong>. (It means that even if a hacker eavesdrops the communication between your smartphone and the Remootio device, and replays it to the Remootio device, the hacker won't be able to open your gates)</li>

</ul></div>","Unlike most IOT products, Remootio comes with built-in Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity, which means that you do not need a separate bridge to make a Bluetooth product WiFi compatible. With Remootio you can control your gates and garage doors from anywhere in the world.The 256 bit authenticated end-to-end encryption between the Remootio device and your smartphone ensures that only you and people you have shared a key with can operate or monitor your gates.Keys are only stored in your smartphone and the Remootio device itself and not somewhere in the cloud so you don't have to worry about security.Since Remootio does not require big and costly servers thanks to the end-to-end encryption technology, there are no operational costs for Remootio users.We have made our App very easy-to use. Everything is exactly where you expect it to be.Thanks to Remootio's Bluetooth connectivity, you can control your gates even when WiFi is not available at your gates or when the internet service is down.You can also connect Remootio to your home WiFi and control your gates from anywhere within your house. In this mode, no data goes through the internet.Thanks to Remootio's internet connectivity, you can control and monitor your gates from anywhere in the world. You can setup internet access easily with a simple click in the Remootio App. Remootio is also compatible with Alexa, so you can ask her to close or open the gate for you and you may also ask her if your gates are left open. If you wish to use Alexa with Remootio, choose the version with the sensor add-on so that Remootio (and therefore Alexa) is aware of your gate's status.  You can easily share keys with family and friends or even Airbnb guests via QR code or via text message. (You can also use the messaging platform of any social media apps to share keys).  Remootio comes with
a guest key (this can be shared with an unlimited number of people)
and 20 unique keys which you can manage one by one in a simple, easy to understand tableIf our Indiegogo project reaches USD 25.000, we give a key upgrade to 100 keys to all Indiegogo backers!


You can get notifications when certain keyholders (such as your children or your gardener for instance) operated the gate so that you know when they arrived and when they left. You may also revoke access any time by long-pressing the name of the keyholder and selecting ""delete"". To rename a keyholder, long-press the name and select ""rename"".Remootio can open the gates automatically as you approach them if you turn on the auto-open feature in the Remootio app.​You can check whether your gate is open or closed from the Remootio app any time. This feature requires the sensor to be installed.Remootio can send you notifications in the following cases:A certain key holder operated the gate. For example you would like to know when your child arrives home Someone rang the doorbellA gate is left open for 5 minutesYou can add as many Remootio devices as you wish and simply swipe between them in the app:In order to make Remootio compatible with as many gate openers as possible we have designed its power unit to work with a very wide input voltage range both with direct and alternating current:

Direct current: 6-36V (polarity independent)
Alternating current: 12-24V
 The only requirement besides the voltage range is that the power supply must be able to provide 500mA current to the Remootio device.Most gate opener electronics fall in the voltage range of Remootio, but if yours is different you can still get the Remootio power adapter, which you may use with the standard EU type 230V or US type 110V sockets.From the Remootio app you can easily rename, add a photo and select a background color for each gate and garage door so that you can easily find it when you are swiping through your devices.       In order to make Remootio accessible for everyone, the Remootio app is available in multiple languages, such as:
English
German
French
Spanish
Italian
and there are more languages to be added soon.Thanks to its small dimensions, Remootio fits just about anywhere. You don't have to get rid of your old remote control yet. You can connect Remootio in parallel with the receiver unit of your old remote controller and keep using both.When it comes to devices that can open and monitor your gates and doors, security is extremely important, that's why we have put so much thought and effort into Remootio's security:
Independently from whether you use Bluetooth or WiFi, Remootio uses 256 bit authenticated end-to-end encryption between your smartphone and the Remootio device


From the Remootio app you have full control over how your smartphone connects to your Remootio device. You can choose from three options:

​Bluetooth: in this mode Remootio only uses its Bluetooth module. No data goes through your WiFi network in this mode. On top of the standard Bluetooth security, the authenticated 256 bit end-to-end encryption ensures security in this mode.

Home WiFi: in this mode Remootio only uses its WiFi module without Bluetooth. No data goes through the internet. All data remains within your home WiFi network.The authenticated 256 bit end-to-end encryption also ensures security in this mode.
Internet: in this mode Remootio is connected to the internet via WiFi. On top of the industry standard SSL connection, the authenticated 256 bit end-to-end encryption guarantees security in this mode. We have created a one-click-setup-environment for setting up the internet connectivity (recommended for most users), but if you are an experienced user you can also define the internet address of your device in the App to setup a peer-to-peer connection.




Keys are generated during setup and are only stored on your smartphone and the Remootio device itself. Your keys are not stored anywhere else.
Even the setup process is protected against hackers trying to get your virtual keys as it uses the highly secure, state-of-the-art Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange method, which together with the additional certificate validation and digital signature scheme, is resistant to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle and other attacks.

Remootio, unlike other gate controllers, is not cloud-based, so your security does not depend on a third party (such as a cloud service provider)
Any time your smartphone sends a request to the Remootio device, it sends a unique mathematical problem back to the smartphone which it can only solve using the key the two devices agreed on during setup. Since this mathematical problem is always different, signals for two opening cycles are never the same, therefore Remootio is protected against replay attacks. (It means that even if a hacker eavesdrops the communication between your smartphone and the Remootio device, and replays it to the Remootio device, the hacker won't be able to open your gates)
Remootio is compatible with most garage door and gate openers as well as several electromagnetic locks. Remootio's output for controlling the gates is a normally open relay output.Hint: If your gate or garage door supports a manual open button (wall button) feature, it is definitely compatible with Remootio. Even if it doesn't have this feature, it can still be compatible. Please check our non-comprehensive compatibility list or send us an e-mail with the brand and type of your gate or garage door to support@remootio.com.Garage doorsSwing gatesSliding gatesElectromagnetic locksAll you need for installation is a cross head screwdriver, a smartphone and the Remootio device.  To make Remootio even better, you can add some useful accessories such as a:You can connect your existing doorbell or any ""normally open"" type buttons to Remootio's doorbell input and get notifications on your smartphone if someone presses this button.You can enable or disable a manual control button from the Remootio app, which the courier or your friends can use to let themselves in until the button is in enabled status. The button you  connect can be any ""normally open"" type buttons. Connect a status sensor to get feedback about whether your gate or garage door is open or closed. Mount the part with the cable to a static (not moving) part of your gate and the wireless part to the moving part of your gate in a way that either in the completely closed or completely opened position the two parts are facing each other as seen below and the distance between them is not more than 10mm. No batteries are needed for the sensor.If the output voltage of your existing gate controller is not within the range of 6-36VDC or 6-25VAC or if it cannot provide at least 500mA current, you will need a power adapter. Currently three versions are available: Type A (US), type C (EU) and a universal power adapter which is compatible with both type I (Australia, New Zealand) and type G (UK, UAE) sockets.Since Indiegogo doesn't let us change the perks after they are claimed, please select either a US or an EU type adapter and if your shipping address is in a country where type I or type G sockets are used, we will contact you after the campaign by e-mail to confirm which type of adapter you wish to receive.Select the perks with multiple items and save on shipping!Included in the box:

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">I HAVE A QUESTION...!</h3>
<p>We have tried to answer all the questions you may have below, but feel free to get in touch if you have any burning questions or comments.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the Mico range so special?</strong></p>
<p>Q: I thought you weren’t supposed to put metal in a microwave oven?</p>
<p>A: Don’t worry our designers have ensured that the Mico range is safe as long as you put it together correctly. As long as metals don’t touch then this is perfectly safe, after all the inside of your microwave oven is made of metal too!</p>
<p>Q: How does food become crispy in Mico and not soggy like other microwave cookware?</p>
<p>A: The principle behind Mico is to shield the microwaves from the food by using metal plates.  Without Heatwave Technology the microwaves would simply bounce around the microwave oven and the food would not heat up.  With Heatwave Technology the microwaves are not deflected away but absorbed and heat the metal plates very rapidly like a traditional heating element, essentially cooking food by conduction and thus creates a crispy grilled appearance on your food.</p>
<p>Q:  How does Heatwave Technology regulate the temperature?</p>
<p>A:  Each Mico appliance has Heatwave Technology applied in a different way.  Our engineers have produced many prototypes to ensure the technology is positioned correctly and the heat is focused in the most efficient way possible.  They have also applied a specific formula to the Technology which limits the maximum temperature achievable depending on the application.  Thousands of tests ensure these parameters have been set correctly and you can produce consistent cooking results every time.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the Mico range quicker at cooking than traditional methods?</strong></p>
<p>Q: Why is baking a potato using Mico cookware faster than cooking in an oven?</p>
<p>A: This is directly linked to the inefficiency of regular appliance heating technologies or the general appliance architecture.  To cook a potato in an oven the entire oven space must be heated evenly.  It takes time to pre-heat the entire oven space and most of that space is wasted and this is costing you money!  Cooking a potato in an oven by convection alone takes much longer as the potato is cooked from the outside in and the potato skin acts a shield.  Mico uses microwaves to cook the inside of the potato first and then utilises Heatwave Technology to create a conduction/convection environment that creates that oven-baked crispy potato skin.</p>
<p>Q: Why do you remove the lid for the first 8 minutes of the cooking process when cooking a potato?</p>
<p>A: Cooking in a microwave oven can have its benefits over conduction and convection cooking as it heats up the water molecules of food.  This means it can cook the inside of a potato very quickly.  However, cooking in a microwave oven alone will result in a soggy wrinkled potato.  This is why for the last 10 minutes we suggest putting the lid back on to shield the potato from the microwaves to give that crisp yet fluffy perfect baked potato.</p>
<p>Q: Why is making a toasted sandwich using Mico cookware faster than cooking in a sandwich maker?</p>
<p>A: A sandwich toastie maker typically uses a radiating heating element which heats an aluminium plate indirectly.  As there is an air gap between the element and aluminium plate it takes a long time for the plate to heat up and heat evenly.  When food is added to the toastie maker the heat will be absorbed quickly and it takes a long time for the aluminium plate temperature to recover.  Mico’s Heatwave Technology directly covers the entire heating plate.  There is no need for a pre-heat phase as it instantly and continuously absorbs microwave energy to ensure the quickest possible heat up time and even heat distribution. </p>
<p>Q: Why is frying an egg using Mico cookware faster than cooking in a pan?</p>
<p>A: Frying an egg typically means heating a frying pan.  Again the entire pan needs to be heated which takes additional time over Mico.  The heat-up time of the pan is directly linked to the type of hob you have (gas, electric or induction) and these can vary dramatically.  The heat distribution in the pan is also linked to the type of hob you have.  Mico Egg could not be easier to use.  To fry simply add a drop of oil, add the egg and Heatwave Technology will do the rest.  The oil will be heated in seconds drastically reducing the time to fry the egg to the desired consistency.</p>
<p>Q: Why is poaching an egg using Mico cookware faster than cooking in a pan?</p>
<p>Poaching an egg typically means heating a pan of water to the boil and then reducing to a simmer.  This can take several minutes and requires a lot of interaction with your appliance.  There is also a required skill level to achieve a perfectly poached egg and of course a further 4-5minutes to wait while the egg cooks.  Mico Egg could not be easier to use.  To poach simply add water to the fill line, add the egg and Heatwave Technology will do the rest.  The small amount of water will be heated to a simmer in seconds drastically reducing the time to poach.</p>
<p><strong>How easy is the Mico range to use?</strong></p>
<p>Q: Can I use the Mico range in an 800W microwave oven and how do the cooking times vary?</p>
<p>A: Mico can be used in any wattage microwave oven, you just need to adjust the cooking times using the guide provided.</p>
<p>Q: Do the elements have a non-stick coating?</p>
<p>A: Yes, all of the element plates in the Mico range have a non-stick coating making cleaning really easy.</p>
<p>Q:  Can I cook other foods in Mico products?</p>
<p>A:  In theory yes.  Heatwave Technology heats the element plates to around 200 to 240 degrees.  In theory there is no reason why different foods can’t be cooked.  We look forward to experimenting when more samples arrive so keep a look out for updates on this during the campaign!</p>
<p>Q:  Do I need to use any special cooking oil?</p>
<p>A:  No, you don’t need anything fancy.  Just a drop of regular vegetable or olive oil will do to fry an egg.  You could try rubbing salt and oil onto the potato before cooking to make it extra crispy.  Toasties always come out nice and crisp if the outside of the bread is buttered.</p>
<p>Q: How durable is Mico?</p>
<p>A: Mico housing is predominantly silicone which is very durable.  Dropping Mico would not be an issue.  Mico toastie does have a plastic clamp system which could break if repeatedly dropped at the wrong angle.</p>
<p>Q: How hot is the silicone housing after the cooking cycle?</p>
<p>A:  Mico’s silicone housing is a great insulating material and will protect you from the metal plates which can get very hot.  However, over longer cooking cycles some heat will be absorbed by the silicone so we would recommend using oven gloves when removing Mico Toastie and Potato.</p>
<p>Q: Can I put the Mico range into a dishwasher?</p>
<p>A: Yes the Mico range is fully dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>Q:  Can I use Mico products in my regular oven?</p>
<p>A:  No.  Mico uses Heatwave Technology which is specifically designed to only work in a microwave oven.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to stick with the suggested portion sizes?</strong></p>
<p>Q:  Do I always have to cook two eggs in Mico Egg?</p>
<p>A:  No. You can cook one egg only if you want.  The cooking time might be slightly lower if only cooking one egg.</p>
<p>Q:  How many potatoes can I fit in Mico Potato?</p>
<p>A:  You can fit one large potato or two smaller potatoes. </p>
<p>Q:  Can I use Mico Egg and Toastie in the microwave oven at the same time?</p>
<p>A:  In theory yes provided your microwave oven is large enough.  However, eggs will cook faster than a toastie.</p>
<p>Q:  Can I put two Mico toasties in a microwave oven at the same time?</p>
<p>A:  If your microwave oven is big enough then yes this is feasible.  Cooking times might be slightly longer if two toasties are cooked together.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT IF I AM NOT HAPPY?</h3>
<p>We really hope this is not the case as we can't wait to get these products into production and into your hands! If after you receive the products you have a problem with them then we will be happy to replace them like-for-like. Sadly though we will not be able to offer you a refund.</p>

A: Don’t worry our designers have ensured that the Mico range is safe as long as you put it together correctly. As long as metals don’t touch then this is perfectly safe, after all the inside of your microwave oven is made of metal too!
Q: How does food become crispy in Mico and not soggy like other microwave cookware?
A: The principle behind Mico is to shield the microwaves from the food by using metal plates.  Without Heatwave Technology the microwaves would simply bounce around the microwave oven and the food would not heat up.  With Heatwave Technology the microwaves are not deflected away but absorbed and heat the metal plates very rapidly like a traditional heating element, essentially cooking food by conduction and thus creates a crispy grilled appearance on your food.
Q:  How does Heatwave Technology regulate the temperature?
A:  Each Mico appliance has Heatwave Technology applied in a different way.  Our engineers have produced many prototypes to ensure the technology is positioned correctly and the heat is focused in the most efficient way possible.  They have also applied a specific formula to the Technology which limits the maximum temperature achievable depending on the application.  Thousands of tests ensure these parameters have been set correctly and you can produce consistent cooking results every time.
Why is the Mico range quicker at cooking than traditional methods?
Q: Why is baking a potato using Mico cookware faster than cooking in an oven?
A: This is directly linked to the inefficiency of regular appliance heating technologies or the general appliance architecture.  To cook a potato in an oven the entire oven space must be heated evenly.  It takes time to pre-heat the entire oven space and most of that space is wasted and this is costing you money!  Cooking a potato in an oven by convection alone takes much longer as the potato is cooked from the outside in and the potato skin acts a shield.  Mico uses microwaves to cook the inside of the potato first and then utilises Heatwave Technology to create a conduction/convection environment that creates that oven-baked crispy potato skin.
Q: Why do you remove the lid for the first 8 minutes of the cooking process when cooking a potato?
A: Cooking in a microwave oven can have its benefits over conduction and convection cooking as it heats up the water molecules of food.  This means it can cook the inside of a potato very quickly.  However, cooking in a microwave oven alone will result in a soggy wrinkled potato.  This is why for the last 10 minutes we suggest putting the lid back on to shield the potato from the microwaves to give that crisp yet fluffy perfect baked potato.
Q: Why is making a toasted sandwich using Mico cookware faster than cooking in a sandwich maker?
A: A sandwich toastie maker typically uses a radiating heating element which heats an aluminium plate indirectly.  As there is an air gap between the element and aluminium plate it takes a long time for the plate to heat up and heat evenly.  When food is added to the toastie maker the heat will be absorbed quickly and it takes a long time for the aluminium plate temperature to recover.  Mico’s Heatwave Technology directly covers the entire heating plate.  There is no need for a pre-heat phase as it instantly and continuously absorbs microwave energy to ensure the quickest possible heat up time and even heat distribution. 
Q: Why is frying an egg using Mico cookware faster than cooking in a pan?
A: Frying an egg typically means heating a frying pan.  Again the entire pan needs to be heated which takes additional time over Mico.  The heat-up time of the pan is directly linked to the type of hob you have (gas, electric or induction) and these can vary dramatically.  The heat distribution in the pan is also linked to the type of hob you have.  Mico Egg could not be easier to use.  To fry simply add a drop of oil, add the egg and Heatwave Technology will do the rest.  The oil will be heated in seconds drastically reducing the time to fry the egg to the desired consistency.
Q: Why is poaching an egg using Mico cookware faster than cooking in a pan?
Poaching an egg typically means heating a pan of water to the boil and then reducing to a simmer.  This can take several minutes and requires a lot of interaction with your appliance.  There is also a required skill level to achieve a perfectly poached egg and of course a further 4-5minutes to wait while the egg cooks.  Mico Egg could not be easier to use.  To poach simply add water to the fill line, add the egg and Heatwave Technology will do the rest.  The small amount of water will be heated to a simmer in seconds drastically reducing the time to poach.
How easy is the Mico range to use?
Q: Can I use the Mico range in an 800W microwave oven and how do the cooking times vary?
A: Mico can be used in any wattage microwave oven, you just need to adjust the cooking times using the guide provided.
Q: Do the elements have a non-stick coating?
A: Yes, all of the element plates in the Mico range have a non-stick coating making cleaning really easy.
Q:  Can I cook other foods in Mico products?
A:  In theory yes.  Heatwave Technology heats the element plates to around 200 to 240 degrees.  In theory there is no reason why different foods can’t be cooked.  We look forward to experimenting when more samples arrive so keep a look out for updates on this during the campaign!
Q:  Do I need to use any special cooking oil?
A:  No, you don’t need anything fancy.  Just a drop of regular vegetable or olive oil will do to fry an egg.  You could try rubbing salt and oil onto the potato before cooking to make it extra crispy.  Toasties always come out nice and crisp if the outside of the bread is buttered.
Q: How durable is Mico?
A: Mico housing is predominantly silicone which is very durable.  Dropping Mico would not be an issue.  Mico toastie does have a plastic clamp system which could break if repeatedly dropped at the wrong angle.
Q: How hot is the silicone housing after the cooking cycle?
A:  Mico’s silicone housing is a great insulating material and will protect you from the metal plates which can get very hot.  However, over longer cooking cycles some heat will be absorbed by the silicone so we would recommend using oven gloves when removing Mico Toastie and Potato.
Q: Can I put the Mico range into a dishwasher?
A: Yes the Mico range is fully dishwasher safe.
Q:  Can I use Mico products in my regular oven?
A:  No.  Mico uses Heatwave Technology which is specifically designed to only work in a microwave oven.
Do I have to stick with the suggested portion sizes?
Q:  Do I always have to cook two eggs in Mico Egg?
A:  No. You can cook one egg only if you want.  The cooking time might be slightly lower if only cooking one egg.
Q:  How many potatoes can I fit in Mico Potato?
A:  You can fit one large potato or two smaller potatoes. 
Q:  Can I use Mico Egg and Toastie in the microwave oven at the same time?
A:  In theory yes provided your microwave oven is large enough.  However, eggs will cook faster than a toastie.
Q:  Can I put two Mico toasties in a microwave oven at the same time?
A:  If your microwave oven is big enough then yes this is feasible.  Cooking times might be slightly longer if two toasties are cooked together.

 to the home isn't happening anytime soon but MonkeyBrains is ready to 
deploy gigabit wireless today.  We will deploy a network of 80GHz links.
 We have already deployed over 50 links of this type to commercial 
buildings, and now we want to share our insane bandwidth with 
residential customers.  Our goal is to create a rapid and repeatable 
deployment system that creates a high speed mesh for residential 
neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The gigabit customers will pay our standard residential rates ($35/month) for Internet. </p>

neighborhoods.  There is also the altruistic aspect of donating double a

grow our networks in those areas: helping us grow helps bridge the digital divide and fosters a San Francisco based company.<br/></p>

Vote for your city at the CITY BATTLE_____________________________________________________________________________We all know the situation: you are standing at the traffic light waiting for the light to turn green. You spend quite some time with strangers and then each one goes their separate ways. You see people but you look past each other. You feel uncomfortable and bored. And that is exactly what the ActiWait is about to change.The idea is very simple: take pedestrian lights and build a touchscreen inside of it, install this on BOTH SIDES of the street and voilà: you can play from one side against the other! This way you`ll be able to have fun while waiting for the traffic lights to turn green and you`ll easily get to meet other people.Yeah well...  the idea was simple but traffic engineering isn't. We talked to a lot of people about this idea and they all thought we are crazy. But in the end we found amazing companies and professionals in the traffic technology industry that supported our work. Since 2012 we've been developing the prototype of the new and innovative push-button. After many ups and downs we are now ready to launch the first gamificated traffic light in the world!!what we haveStreetPong became a Prototype of a product and so it needed to get a new name. The game was just the beginning and so we called it... the ActiWait! Because you use it while waiting .. and you're not passive, you're active!  The prototype is finally installed at a traffic light for the first time in history. In order for this to happen we worked with the best developers that we could think of. They are experts in traffic technology and software development. The prototype is 3D printed and fully equipped, the first game is programmed and we`ve already launched our product in october so we can proudly say: the world's first smart pedestrian light button is finally here!

Right now the smart pedestrian light button ActiWait is just a prototype with basic functions. But in the future we need some more!         Hardware           Software               Case                  Tests           ApplicationsFor this to happen we still have to develop the hard- and software to a final stage, the new case needs to be produced professionally and our product needs to pass official safety tests. We want to imply a special type of WiFi so we can change the applications on the fly, to provide you for example with :

<p>We have created Lineable to last at
least one year. Distinctly different from other tracking devices the user
is <b>able to initiate Lineable</b> through

<p>2. HOW MANY PHONES ARE ABLE TO TRACK LINEABLE?</p>
<p>As many phones within the range. We
have programmed Lineable to notify its location not through pairing Bluetooth but instead, when Lineable is detected in any device that has installed

<p><strong> <span>Closed Design Eliminates Odor</span> </strong></p>
<p>Let’s be honest, there is nothing worse than a smelly litter box in the home. But Poop Cube is here to solve this problem. Thanks to the enclosed design, there won’t be any waste exposed to the open air. Odors remain isolated and contained to keep your home fresh and pleasant.<br/> </p>

<p><strong> <span>Top Opening &amp; Mat Eliminate Litter Tracking</span> </strong></p>
<p>The top opening design eliminates litter tracking that is common with ordinary cat boxes. Any stray litter left on the lid of Poop Cube will fall back inside when the lid is swiveled open for scooping, and grooves of the front mat catch litter effectively when your cat walks off. Litter tracking is virtually eliminated and the floor or carpet around the box stays clean. <br/> </p>

</div></div>","Cat owners love to pamper their pets. However, they face a dilemma when choosing a cat litter box on the current market. They are forced to choose between an ugly plastic tray that that lacks hygiene features, or they must opt for a bulky and complicated robotic contraption with an unnecessarily expensive price.  
Poop Cube: Your Pur-fect Choice 
Introducing Poop Cube, a minimalist cat litter box that helps prevent litter tracking and saves time while leaving your home odor free. The swivel lid makes scooping and cleaning a snap and the uniquely-designed 3-in-1 cleaning set is a great helper for quick and simple tidying up. And best of all, odor won’t be a problem anymore thanks to the enclosed design specially made to effectively prevent bad smells from escaping. 
 

 
 
 
 
 Full & Easy Access for Better Cleaning   
Nobody likes to scoop poop! It’s just the price we pay to have the loving companionship of our cats. So when it’s time to dig in, a bigger access for cleaning is surely helpful and lets you get the dirty deed done quickly. The swivel lid opens like a trunk, providing a wide-open space for easier cleaning. Simply, open, scoop, and get on with your life.  
 
 An Efficient 3-in-1 Cleaning Set 
The Poop Cube Cleaning Set becomes your “right-hand man”. It consists of a scoop, dustpan and hand brush that are ingeniously integrated together. The scoop is designed to sift faster and slide easily through the litter, while the dustpan and hand brush allow for quick, easy tidying around the litter box. We can’t promise you that cleaning up after kitty will be fun, but with Poop Cube, it’s easier and faster. 

 

 
 
 Closed Design Eliminates Odor 
Let’s be honest, there is nothing worse than a smelly litter box in the home. But Poop Cube is here to solve this problem. Thanks to the enclosed design, there won’t be any waste exposed to the open air. Odors remain isolated and contained to keep your home fresh and pleasant. 
 Enclosed Design Keep Your Home Fresh And Pleasant 
 Top Opening & Mat Eliminate Litter Tracking 
The top opening design eliminates litter tracking that is common with ordinary cat boxes. Any stray litter left on the lid of Poop Cube will fall back inside when the lid is swiveled open for scooping, and grooves of the front mat catch litter effectively when your cat walks off. Litter tracking is virtually eliminated and the floor or carpet around the box stays clean.  
 The Top Opening Collects Litter
 
 
 Minimalist Cat Furniture that Fits Every Home 
How do you make a cat box look interesting and fit within contemporary home décor? You give it a clever makeover with an eye for style. Designed by two architects, Poop Cube is minimalist inspired cat furniture that elevates the simple cat box into something that perfectly fits modern home styles. Stay neat, stay simple, and stay stylish.   
 
 Tailored to Fit All Cats 
With top-entry or front-entry configurations, Poop Cube suits different sizes of cats - no matter if your beloved pet is a small kitten or distinguished elder with reduced agility, they will have no trouble using Poop Cube. The box can even accommodate cats wearing an Elizabethan collar (the dreaded cone). 
 
 A Switch for Different Usages 
 
 
 
 Easy to Wash
The body and base of Poop Cube are connected by two buckles and could be detached easily. Thus you are able to clean the inner space of Poop Cube thoroughly.  
 Modular Design for Thorough Cleansing

The Midea U-Shaped AC is the first of its kind, a window air conditioning unit with fast and powerful cooling while super efficient. Your home is about to get a whole lot cooler.


It’s no secret that using window air conditioner units has its downsides. You will seal one of your windows to keep it in. They can be noisy, a pain to install, and they sure use a lot of electricity.
Unlike traditional units, the Midea U-Shaped AC is a radically new type of window air conditioner. Its revolutionary U-shaped design blocks the noise out and makes it faster and easier to set up. The unique Inverter Quattro technology keeps your home cool through the worst of the summer while using 35% less energy to run.
And you don’t even have to give up a window- you can still open and close your window any time, just as you normally would.

The Midea U-shaped AC’s unique design offers unparalleled flexibility. Unlike other window AC units, Midea’s patented U-shaped design allows your window to open and close normally, without sacrificing efficiency or effectiveness. Get fresh air into your home anytime you need it. Breathe easier with the Midea U-shaped AC.

 

Installing your Midea U-shaped AC is quick and easy. Just install the  (included) quick-snap bracket, set the unit on the bracket, and secure the sidearms. The job is done! Just close your window and enjoy the cool air.
With the adjustable side arms and the U-shaped groove width of 2.75 inches, the unit can fit almost any window. And don’t worry about security – the window is secured by an anti-theft mechanism while closed.

 

Keep your home cool and quiet. The Midea U-shaped AC is up to 9 times quieter than traditional units, as its unique U shape design blocks the noise coming from the compressor outside the window and walls, so you can enjoy the comfort with peace of mind. This allows for ultra-quiet operation as low as 42 dB - almost as quiet as a library!




Getting great sleep is one of the best things you can do for your health. The Midea U-shaped AC can help you get that undisturbed, restful night's sleep. It will also be ideal for working, studying or binging your favorite shows.


The Midea U-shaped AC has a stronger airflow than traditional units as you can feel the cold air up to 20 feet away, enough to cover every corner of your room, whatever the shape. At the same time, the full DC inverter technology enables the unit to cool your home fast, and you’ll feel the crisp, cool air as soon as you turn it on. The 3 different size options make it ideal for any living space, just pick the right BTU for your room size (8K BTU is ideal for 251-350 Sq Ft, 10K BTU  is ideal 351-450 Sq Ft, 12K BTU is ideal for 451-550 Sq Ft) and you can enjoy cool air fast and easy while maximizing your energy savings.


The Midea U-shaped AC uses Full DC Inverter technology to achieve more than 35% energy savings compared to traditional units in the market. It's the first window AC to obtain the ENERGY STAR Most Efficient 2020 certification. This is due to its patented Inverter Quattro design, which allows it to do more with considerably less electricity than traditional window units. This makes it more environmentally friendly and saves you money. In a very short time, the energy savings mean the Midea U-shaped AC can pay for itself.
Midea U-shaped AC is the first window AC to obtain the ENERGY STAR Most Efficient 2020 certification. It provides 12K BTU strong cooling power with a record-breaking low estimated yearly energy cost of $58, which is 35% less than similar models.

Note: Your cost will depend on your utility rates and use. Cost range based only on models of similar capacity without reverse cycle and with louvered sides. Estimated energy cost based on a national average electricity cost of 13. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov/energy.

With an innovative U-shaped groove design and unique drop-in install method, you may open your window even with your AC installed!
If you'd like to keep your window open to enjoy fresh air during comfortable summer nights, Midea's AC is a perfect combination of form and function.

I'm looking forward to backing another of your successful projects!""  -- Anna K.""This is absolutely beautiful!"" -- Cindy L.Why Trance Jewel?The original Trance Sphere. 3,057 backers pledged $502,998 to bring it to life!The trance sphere was a wonderful product that turned out better than anyone expected. The quality of the finish was and still is the benchmark of quality in the industry. Everyone who stops by my desk naturally asks about it and the urge to pick it up and hold it is generally irresistible. I myself find myself rolling the sphere in my hand whenever I'm concentrating on a difficult problem. It really does seem to stimulate my thoughts somehow.The Trance Sphere in Titanium was a great concentration tool as well.I feel like my life has noticeably improved with the sphere at my desk. It gets more attention than the cube, acts as concentration tool and is generally just super cool. There was something missing, however. Whenever I wasn't at my desk, I found myself without my trusty spherical companion. It is impractical to take with me, even to meetings because of its shape and size. I needed something more portable.A tiny 2 cm mini sphere was a little too small for daily useFirst, I tried just carrying around the mini sphere, but it wasn't very satisfying at 2 cm in size. It was still a bit uncomfortable to carry, even at that size. With the spinner craze, I tried substituting the sphere with spinners of various types, but they all felt cheap (even solid metal spinners) and uncomfortable compared with the perfect mirror-finish smooth simplicity of the sphere.I needed to be something that wasn't awkward or overly heavy, but still retained the sphere's magical mirror-smoothness and solid feel. At first, it seemed like a relatively easy task. I carried around everyday objects like stones, other metal shapes and pens, but nothing had the right feel. Nothing else was inducing that sense of concentration that the sphere gives.We decided to make our own shape. It was time to make something new.Our first 3D paper mockup of the jewel conceptAfter dozens of iterations, paper and 3D mockups, we settled on a shape. We struggled with the exact size and shape since we wanted something thin enough to carry around, but we couldn't accept any bends or edges. Choosing among dozens of curves for the perfect feelWe wanted something we could fit in a wallet, but would feel natural in the hand. Even once we settled on a basic shape, we had variations in the mathematical formula that describes the exact nature of the curves.The incredible quality and finish on the jewel prototypes shocked usThe finish is so perfect it looks like a drop of liquid copperA copper prototype profile. It feels perfect in the handWe settled on what's called an oblate spheroid - basically a flattened sphere. When the prototypes came back, we instantly knew we had what we were looking for: A solid portable sphere replacement that induced that same magical feeling the sphere gave us. In fact, I think the Jewel spheroid feels even better in the hand than the sphere, and the portability is better than expected for daily use.Slides unnoticed into your pocketThe Jewel even fits in your wallet!After hundreds of hours of hard work by our whole team, we've reached the end of the road.

</div></div>","We make the pillow cube out of the same high rebound comfort foams that the top bed-in-the box companies use, but just a whole lot less of it. Most pillows shred their foam into a lumpy mess. Why not give you a highly engineered, structurally soft, perfectly shaped bed for your head?  And we wrapped it all up in a Silky smooth stretchy cover.
*PillowCube is made of 2.5 pounds of copper-gel-infused viscoelastic polyurethane foam AND a little bit of love. 

A perfect cube looked great, but after extensive testing, we found the perfect dimensions. We argued about the perfect dimensions, then we decided to offer the PillowCube in two sizes. 
People with broad shoulders and big noggins will LOVE the 7"" PillowCube, while people with narrower shoulders will prefer the 5"" PillowCube.
 
Designed for your head (but you can use it wherever you need to). 
Propping up your head when sleeping on your side not only helps with spinal alignment, but also decreases sleep apnea and reduces acid reflux. You don't have to use the PillowCube on your head. This soft little building block will fit wherever you need it (even that cube shaped hole in your heart)**

**Pillow Cube is not guaranteed to reduce loneliness. 
EVEN MORE USES FOR THE PILLOW CUBE

We make it easy for you to live a more sustainable lifestyle, by designing high-quality towels at a fair price.The towel is blended with TENCEL™ Modal, providing increased absorbency and a luxurious feel.Breathability is the essential feature of a soft towel. Ultra fluffy towels tend to be thirsty, but because they do not release the absorbed water they can get smelly. This indicates the growth of yucky bacteria.Our solution: we chose a thickness of 600 GSM which is cosy enough, but not too fluffy. The innovative 8 pearl stitch maximizes the surface for even more breathability.We offer four different colours. Cloud White (a slight Off-White), Bae Rosé (a super soft pink) and Slate Grey (a dark grey) and Ocean Blue (a classic navy blue) Note: You will be able to choose your favourite colour in the Checkout Process.Kushel is the first towel made from organic cotton and TENCEL™ Modal. We tested several blends and are proud to present this perfectly tailored towel.TENCEL™ Modal fibers are produced by Eco Soft technology in Austria by Lenzing. They are the state of the art producer and evironmentally responsible, offering exquisite softness to textiles. The technology uses elemental chlorine-free bleaching in an integrated process, from pulp to fiber, which has high recovery rates of process ingredients and causes very low air emissions.HOW TO PRE ORDER: 1.

Trees store a considerable amount of carbon dioxide within their lifetime and help to cool down the planet by lowering air temperature as they provide shade and stabilize the soil. With our partners Plant for the Planet, Trees for the Future an Klimapatenschaft Pflanzaktion we aim to plant 1 Million trees in Mexico, Africa and Germany.After testing all the top rated towels, different materials and compositions for over a year, we finally discovered the perfect material combination and partners to create the perfect towel for you and mother nature.We choose to produce our towels in north Portugal, a region known for state-of-the-art craftmanship and fair working conditions and. Our manufacturing partner is member of SMETA (Sedex Member’s Ethical Trade Audit and is working on the implementation of STeP by OEKO-TEX Certification. The Kushel towel is OEKO-TEX 100 certified.In June 2018 we got certified as a B-Corp Corporation with our existing business of distributing the social business Ethnotek Bags in Germany. As a certified B-Corp we are now legally required to consider the impact of our decisions on our workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. We have signed a code of conduct with our partners.   Wir möchten beweisen, dass es möglich ist ein hochwertiges Produkt zu entwickeln und dabei dem Planeten mehr Ressourcen zurückzugeben als wir für die Produktion verwendet haben.Wie wir das schaffen? Pro Handtuch pflanzen wir 2 Bäume und gleichen den gesamten CO2 und Wasserverbrauch der Produktion aus. Somit geben mehr zurück und leisten einen aktiven Beitrag den Klimawandel aufzuhalten.Das Kuschel Handtuch ist umweltfreundlicher als ein konventionelles Handtuch aus Baumwolle. Dadurch wollen wir es Menschen einfach machen sich zuhause wohl zu fühlen und der Welt etwas Gutes zu tun – Ohne Verzicht und zu einem fairen Preis.Die Atmungsaktivität ist essenziell für unser weiches Handtuch. Dicke Handtücher nehmen zwar viel Wasser auf, trocknen aber langsamer. Das ergibt den perfekten Nährboden für Bakterien und das Handtuch fängt schnell an zu riechen.Das Kushel Handtuch löst dieses Problem indem es eine mittlere Dicke aufweist und mit einem speziellen „8-Pearlstitch“ versehen ist, der die Oberfläche vergrößert und es somit schneller trocknen lässt.Kushel ist das erste Handtuch das aus TENCEL™ Modal und Baumwolle aus biologischem Anbau hergestellt wird. Durch das besondere Mischverhältnis können die Fasern ihre volle Wirkung entfalten.Du kannst Dir sicher sein, dieses Handtuch ist umweltfreundlich hergestellt.Unser Partner LENZING produziert die TENCEL™ Modal Fasern mit Hilfe der Eco Soft Technologie in einem Naherholungsgebiet in Österreich.

<p>Beth and I started <strong>Orange Mud</strong> to be innovative, different, and to keep manufacturing local. Our passion for outdoor adventures has taken us from mud runs to marathons, mountain bike to adventure racing, and from triathlon to Ironman. Many times though, a walk around the neighborhood or a simple night time hike with friends is just as good.

<p>HydraQuiver™</p>
<p><strong>Our Marketing Tidbit</strong></p>
<p>Tired of bouncing and sloshing hydration packs? How about a waist pack tight around your waist and generating heat. Or the never ending acrobatic battle of trying to squeeze the bottle into the holder that is too small?</p>
<p>We aim to fix these problems. The HydraQuiver™ is a new approach to lightweight and minimal bounce to the running pack market. It's a tiny pack with loads of features. Thick foam pads and extra wide air channels provide ample support and maximum breathability. The water bottle holder is unique too sporting easy access with a wide tapered funnel opening and perfect retention once the bottle is in place. Easy in, easy out. Another bonus? Use a bottle then throw it in the dishwasher. That's hard to do with a bladder based system...</p>
<p>This pack isn't just for runners, it's great for a walk around the neighborhood, pushing around the baby stroller, or for walking your dog. We've found the mesh pockets work great for food, but also for doggie treats!</p>
<p><strong>Key Info</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely lightweight pack that is easy to forget it's presence once you're off for your journey.</li>
<li>Funnel shaped extra wide bottle opening for easy bottle storage.</li>
<li>Food/accessory pockets on the shoulders for quick access.</li>
<li>Small footprint of the pack keeps heat buildup low.</li>
<li>Velcro® is kept to a minimum so it stays clear from your high tech wicking sports apparel. It’s a great product, but doesn't play nice with synthetics. </li>
<li>We also want you safe at night so we put reflective webbing at the bottom of the pack that lights up nicely in the dark.</li>

</ul><p><strong>Project History Timeline</strong></p>
<p>We're just over 9 months into development as of today. It's been a long road, but we feel that our project is ready for a large roll out. To give you an idea of the design history, please see below. </p>
<p><strong>0-2 Months -</strong> We started this project almost a year ago in our garage by destroying many backpacks (some that I loved very much), and some basic tie down straps for the nylon webbing. We had a sewing machine in our garage that has survived three moves over the years, well, turned out it was broken all this time. So that left us sewing by hand which is certainly not pretty, nor easy in thick materials. Nevertheless our first concept came to life and we ran many nights in the dark to test it thoroughly yet still stay under the radar. </p>
<p><strong>2-4 Months -</strong> Once we realized that our concept had legs, we began looking to a local seamstresses for help. We got some great help in refinement, but it turns out that sewing machines for backpacks aren't the same for sewing wedding gowns. Equipment limitations aside we were able to refine and learn a few key steps along the way and further realize that we're on the right track with our concept. </p>
<p><strong>4-5 months</strong> - Hiring an industrial designer in Bend, OR helped to get our feet off the ground and moving towards a package that would show manufacturers that we actually had a strong design and were serious about our project. Who knew it would be so hard to get people to want to make a product for a small scale operation! </p>
<p><strong>6 months to present - </strong>We finally found a local source in Huntington Beach with a core specialty in backpacks, jump packs and military applications. As it turns out, he was a master at turning our concept into reality. A big thanks go to Mike for helping us get the pack to where it is today. </p>
<p><strong>Present Time</strong> - We've learned a great deal about design, materials, resources and most importantly to you, how this pack works. With your project support we will put the finishing touches on the pack and bring this idea to full scale reality. If we should be so lucky to fund, we’ll be making some minor tweaks, mainly cosmetic then will run full production and ship before the holidays!</p>
<p>1. The closure on the mesh pocket will be a bit wider and more robust to accommodate a more secure seal. </p>
<p>2. The grommet for a head phone port will be replaced with a more resilient polymer.  </p>
<p>3. The reflective strips on the back will be replaced with one robust strip that goes the width of the pack for a cleaner look and more reflectivity. </p>
<p>4. We're hoping to have orange instead of gray on the elastic loops on the shoulder but large custom runs may delay that.</p>
<p><strong>We look forward to your support and will put your funding to good use! Not able to fund? No problem! If you could spread the word to your friends and social sites that would be awesome too. </strong></p>

<p>We’ve been cold brewing coffee for over 10 years and when we tried to find an easy to use cold brewer at a reasonable price we were left scratching our heads. Cold brew coffee makers on the market today range from DIY mason jars, to white buckets, to tubs and spigots, three-foot tall towers; some even cost thousands of dollars. True these methods all make cold brew coffee, but they’re messy, hard to use, require paper filters, and lack good design. </p>
<p>Every part of the BOD™ was designed with a purpose. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and with its elegant design, you won’t have to hide it after each use! After 3 years of designing, drafting, engineering and prototyping, we’re ready to show our BOD™ to the world!</p>

<p><b>What Is The Cost For Shipping To Alaska, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Canada?</b></p>
<p>Shipping to Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and Canada is $20.</p>
<p><b>What Country’s Do You Ship To and What Is The Cost?</b></p>
<p>We've shipped to 56 countries so far. The flat rate is $40 to ship one system. </p> <b>Can I Return My BOD<b>™</b>?</b><p>Due to discounted pricing and the complexities of crowdfunding, shipping and fulfillment, all sales are final. The BOD™ is warrantied for 5 years from date of purchase.</p>
<p><b>How Much Coffee Does The BOD</b><b>™</b><b> Use?</b></p>
<p>The BOD™ uses 8 oz. or ½ lb. of coffee per brew cycle.  The coffee extract it produces, will make 8-12 servings, depending on how much extract you use. This brew method initially uses more coffee than hot brewing, however unlike drip coffee, there is no waste, (most people drink all of their coffee extract) and if you re-brew the grounds, you get even more coffee. It was also designed so that you can re-brew the coffee grounds a second time and get 3 additional servings per brew cycle, or up to 30 servings per pound of coffee. If you pay $10.00 per pound for coffee, this comes to just .33 cents per serving!</p>
<p><b>How Much Coffee Extract Does The BOD</b><b>™ Make &amp; How Many Servings</b><b>?</b></p>
<p>The BOD™ coffee system will make approximately 24 oz of super concentrated coffee extract per brew cycle, which will make 8-12 cups, (8 oz. each) per brew cycle.  However, the number of servings depends on how much coffee extract you use for each serving. If you use more coffee extract, you’ll have fewer servings. If you choose to Re-Brew your coffee grounds, you’ll get an additional 6 servings per pound, up to 30 cups total.</p>
<p><b>What Makes The BOD</b><b>™</b><b> Different Than Other Cold Brewers?</b></p>
<p>The BOD™ is the first and only cold brew coffee ‘system’, optimized for cold brewing, that’s spill-proof, shatterproof, compact, modular and portable with no filters to buy. Portable Mini Bean and Baby Bean flasks allow you to take cold brew coffee to go. </p>
<p><b>How's The Taste Of Re-Brewed Coffee Grounds?</b></p>
<p>It's strong, flavorful and requires no dilution with water. The BOD™ makes re-brewing easy and convenient</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What Type of Grind Can Be Used?</b></p>
<p>We recommend a “coarse grind” for the best flavor and results.</p>
<p><b>How Strong Is BodyBrew<b>™</b> Coffee?</b></p>
<p>The BOD™ makes a super concentrated coffee extract that gets stronger the longer you brew it. If you like stronger coffee, brew it longer, 18 hours or more. After brewing you can customize each cup, to taste. Adjust the extract to water ratio for the perfect cup of coffee. Most people brew between 18-24 hours.</p>
<p><b>How Long Will The Coffee Extract Stay Fresh In The Refrigerator?</b></p>
<p>You can store your BodyBrew™ coffee extract for up to 3 weeks. For optimal flavor and freshness, 1-2 weeks is best.</p>
<p><b>What Is The BOD</b><b>™</b><b> Made Out Of?</b></p>
<p>We chose the highest quality materials we could find to make the BOD™. We partnered with Eastman® and use their cutting edge, proprietary material called Tritan™ which is dishwasher durable, stain resistant and, BPA/BPS, PVC and Phthalate free. The filter is made out of high quality stainless steel that’s made to last and you’ll never have to buy filters again.</p>
<p><b>Do You Use Recycled Materials?</b></p>
<p>While Tritan™ is recyclable at the end of your BOD’s life cycle, it is not made from post-consumer plastics. Most recycled materials come from old milk jugs and water bottles which do not meet our stringent standards for product quality and durability.</p>
<p><b>Is The BOD</b><b>™</b><b> Being Made In The USA?</b></p>
<p>Tritan is made in the USA, but the product is manufactured in China. We made every effort possible to get the BOD™ made in the USA, but after spending 6 months talking to 9 different suppliers, we couldn't find any suppliers who wanted to manufacture it. We had no choice but to move on to a supplier that could get the job done. Some USA suppliers did not even get back to us with quotes, and others either did not meet our quality standards, or were priced so high it would be too expensive for our customers. We were disappointed, but we were able to find a great overseas manufacturer that not only adheres to our strict quality standards, but also gave us a very good price. This allowed us to deliver a top quality product at the best possible price to our customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How Much Does The BOD</b><b>™</b><b> Weigh and What Are The Dimensions?</b></p>
<p>The BOD™ weighs in at 3 lbs. and measures 12.5″ tall with a diameter of 6.3″.</p>
<p><b>Can I Use The BOD</b><b>™</b><b> To Brew Tea?</b></p>
<p>Yes, just add 1/6 pound of loose tea (herbal tea also) into the stainless filter and fill brew chamber with cold water. Cold brew for 12 hours, flip the BOD™ System over to drain and pour into the Extract Chamber for storage. When you want to make a glass of tea, hot or cold, just add 2 oz. of tea concentrate to 7 oz. of water to taste. </p>
<p><b>How Does The BOD Compare To Single Serve Machines and PODS?</b></p>
<p>Single serve machines may be convenient and less messy for you, but because the plastic pods are not recyclable, they’re definitely messy for the earth. With almost 10 billion pods sold last year, they create an enormous amount of landfill waste. Pods are also very expensive, costing up to $50 per pound of coffee!  Plus, the coffee they brew is high in acid. The BOD™ does not require pods, brews coffee that's low in acid and you'll never have to buy filters again.</p>

We’ve been cold brewing coffee for over 10 years and when we tried to find an easy to use cold brewer at a reasonable price we were left scratching our heads. Cold brew coffee makers on the market today range from DIY mason jars, to white buckets, to tubs and spigots, three-foot tall towers; some even cost thousands of dollars. True these methods all make cold brew coffee, but they’re messy, hard to use, require paper filters, and lack good design. 
Every part of the BOD™ was designed with a purpose. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and with its elegant design, you won’t have to hide it after each use! After 3 years of designing, drafting, engineering and prototyping, we’re ready to show our BOD™ to the world!

We want to be in the know to prevent ourselves from any harmful environmental conditions all the time. So we made MicroBot Alert!Alert is a tiny device that can monitor various atmospheric variables including temperature, moisture, air pressure, light intensity, noise level and CO2 level, organic chemicals(VOCs), movements, and more. Thanks to multiple built-in sensors and machine learning, Alert learns about you and your environment and sends you push notifications containing useful information and recommendations about the environment. It gets more useful and accurate as you use Alert longer and longer.Alert is so tiny that it can easily affix to any appliance, wall, or backpack. You can take it with you anywhere or install it in a place to monitor the environment locally and remotely 24/7.Alert can be used with the corresponding MicroBot Alert app (available on iOS and Android), IFTTT, Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It connects to your smartphone or optionally to a smart hub via Bluetooth Low Energy.Alert's mobile app screenThe best thing about Alert is that you don’t actually have to actively use it. Just carry it with you or leave it somewhere in a place. You will automatically receive insightful messages about the environment and air quality.Smart Alerts exampleWithin the app, you can set conditions manually, and the details are available in the later section. VentureBeat - ""Sense leverages artificial intelligence to become smarter and give users better recommendations over time.""TechRadar - ""MicroBot Sense is a tiny multi-function sensor for a tiny price.""Markets Insider - ""Sense offers a comprehensive solution to monitor and detect any change in the environment""TrendHunter - ""Sense is small enough to carry around anywhere, giving . consumers precise information on the atmosphere around them.""Geeky Gadgets - ""Sense learns about you and your environment and sends you push notifications containing useful information and recommendations about the environment.""InsideHook - ""Thanks to its tiny size, you can take and measure your surroundings anywhere you go.""The Ambient - ""The MicroBot Sense will track the health of your home on the cheap""Media Contact Beatrix Labbe, Naran Inc., edward@thenaran.com The possibilities are endless, but here are some examples.1. Monitor various locations in a house (including TVOC & CO2)Alert can tell you a lot more than just temperature and humidity. It can ""sense"" if lights are turned on in the basement or in the garage, if the kitchen needs ventilation, if the closet isn't too humid, and so on.Surprisingly, temperatures can be quite different in different locations even in a small house.2. Beware your surroundings Alert can also detect and measure VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and carbon dioxide. These are invisible and can be extremely toxic. You want to be in the know 24/7.Surprisingly, VOCs are commonly found in everyday things.3. Get notified when your dryer finishesAlert's built-in accelerometer can look after your laundry and send you a push alert when it finishes.Don’t you often forget about your laundry?4. Make sure the air conditioning isn't polluting the airCirculating air conditioning increases the carbon dioxide level in your car, making you drowsy while driving.Know when to ventilate5. Know when someone is at the doorThe noise sensor can detect the knocking sound and give you a heads-up wherever you are.You will get a push alert when someone knocks on your door!6. Share your data with friendsYou can instantly send your current conditions and location to your friends and family along with a photo or a video at anytime.You can share your current weather condition with others.7. Check if all lights are turned offDo you often forget to turn off the lights in the garage or in the basement? Alert can tell you if all lights are turned off before you sleep. You can also set up an automation rule to turn on lights automatically when it becomes dark in the evening.Make sure your smart home automation executed as expected8. Proper atmosphere, very importantChanges in temperature and humidity could affect your valuables, especially string instruments and camera lenses. Stay in the know of where you store them. Make sure you keep the humidity between 40-50%RH!  The most basic feature that Alert offers is monitoring the atmosphere. The app user interface explains it well below.For users who just want a quick summary of current conditions, you can just press the tactile button on Alert, and it will send a push notification to your smartphone (the “Quick Check” feature).""Quick check"" demo The Smart Alerts feature enables users to automatically receive push messages to their smartphones when certain conditions change.Alert is able to catch the atmospheric changes around you and give you more insights about the environment and the air quality, so you can take any necessary actions for you and your family. These messages are based on analyzing your Alert data against various international air quality and construction standards such as ASHRAE, CSA, and so on.Alert configuration with various conditionsUsers can manually configure conditions themselves. For example, to receive a notification message when the living room lights are turned on, or when the temperature drops below 0°in the basement.  Alert WorldYou’re welcome to contribute your environmental data and share it with the community, allowing others to benefit from real-time weather. You’re free to opt-out from sharing at anytime. “Alexa! Ask MicroBot to check Living room” “Alexa! Ask MicroBot to check my parent’s house” “Alexa! Ask MicroBot to check the baby room condition”The Alexa Skill is already implemented and currently being tested for the “Works with Alexa” Certification. Google Home integration is under development and will be available for use when we ship the first batch.  Built around BLE technology, Alert comes with a tracking feature for free. Thanks to MicroBot Cloud, the community can help you find your Alert when you lose it somewhere you don’t remember (the ""Find my MicroBot"" feature - a.k.a. crowd GPS). Alert can also measure the TVOC concentration level as well as carbon dioxide level in the air.   MicroBot Cloud enables remote monitoring, integrations with other services and the “Find my MicroBot” feature. It’s an optional service that makes Alert even more useful.MicroBot Cloud operates with a dedicated smart hub, smartphone or tablet. If you have a spare iOS or Android device at home, you can remotely access your installed Alert through the device from anywhere, anytime. Having a dedicated smart hub is good (and cheaper if you don’t have a spare smart device) because it provides more consistent user experience and connectivity. If you need a dedicated hub device, please add $59 to your pledge!All backers will get 1-year MicroBot Cloud subscription for free and unlimited remote access to your Alert! Pair and use in 5 seconds.

 
Really, it’s that easy.    We have produced many working prototypes and developed iOS and Android apps (already released for testing). Alert is being reviewed for Alexa Certification, and the Google Home and Clova integrations are on the way. Warranty1-year limited warranty.

It used to be quite unique to Japan and Korea, but it’s increasingly becoming a major social issue in many countries including the United States.We were asked to address this particular issue and lucky enough to receive some funds to do the R&D for a year. For this, we needed a way to monitor person’s behaviors in a place without sacrificing privacy, so Internet Protocol (IP) cameras were no good. We came up with the multi-sensor idea; analyzing multiple environmental data can tell you beyond room conditions. With Alert, it’s now easy to detect whether a person is having a normal day or having abnormal days over a period of time. It’s easy to install, easy to use. That’s how and why Alert was born in the beginning. Achieving mass production will decrease the cost and help solve many similar issues. We’re the maker of MicroBot Push, the robotic button pusher turning any dumb appliance into a smart gadget.In late 2015, Push was successfully funded on Indiegogo and shipped to 20+ countries. It’s now widely available through various retailers in US, Japan, Korea, UK, Germany, France, and more. It’s also listed in Amazon Launchpad, and its Alexa Certification is being processed along with Alert. Push is now also used by many disabled people (especially those with limited mobility) across the world. We’re proud that our product is useful, usable and used by many users and hoping the same for Alert. Risks and challengesWe’ve done mass production a couple of times now, and we’re still regularly running batches for MicroBot Push, so we know what to do with manufacturing. For this project, software is more of a challenge than the hardware. We need lots backers for Alert World to become more useful and usable to all of us. 
the Alert World needs your contribution to cover more areas
the data collected by Alert World is essentially used for advancing the Smart Alerts feature. The more data, the more accurate and useful the alerts will become. 
there will be lots of data coming from everywhere around the world, so making our server more stable and secured is our first priority before the shipment.",54.0,4,"2 Campaigns

A brand new way to interact with a brand new take on a clock.
 
Wave Hello
Oboo features a front facing gesture sensor, providing an intuitive and natural way to use your smart device.

Wave left, right, up, and down to control your Oboo.
 
A Touch of Light
The top of the Oboo features a Touch Pad that replaces the need for physical buttons. An animated, full color light bar is integrated into the touch pad to provide context and light up your space.
 
Dynamic Buttons 
When your Oboo needs multiple inputs, the Touch Pad automatically becomes four discrete buttons.

The functionality of the buttons is contextual and depends on what you’re trying to do. Each button is color matched to actions displayed on the screen. 
 
Alarm Button 
When the alarm is going off and it’s time to get up, the entire touch pad acts as a single button: the off button.
 
Nightlight 
The touch pad works double-duty as a touch input surface as well as a light source for your space.

The night light will turn on automatically when your Oboo clock detects that you’re ready for bed and have turned off the lights. Wave goodnight to turn the night light off.
A wave during the night will turn it on to gently illuminate the room, making it easy to get around.
 
 

How an IoT device should be: practical and easy to use. 
Cards
Everything you need for your day is available at a glance. Oboo grabs real-time data from the internet and displays what you need to know in a series of cards.

Included Cards with Oboo's launch software:

Weather
Calendar
Traffic Info
Timer
Music

More Cards to come! We want to hear your ideas on Cards to add in future software updates.
 
WiFi
Oboo is always connected thanks to its built-in WiFi. That’s how it can get the most up to date weather and traffic data from trusted online sources as well as grab events from your calendar.
It is because of this constant internet connection that you can use the Oboo app to control your clock from anywhere and everywhere.

 
 
Music ♫
Wirelessly connect your smartphone, tablet, or other Bluetooth-enabled device within a 50-foot range to stream your favorite tunes on Oboo’s high quality speakers. 
Keep the tunes pumping wherever you go! The built-in battery makes your Oboo a 100% portable, totally wireless speaker.
Supports Bluetooth 4.2 
 
Power
Use the two fast-charging USB ports on the back of Oboo to charge your devices.
Use your Oboo on the go. It comes with a built-in Lithium ion battery that can power it for 20** hours of regular use and 8** hours of playing music over Bluetooth. Recharge Oboo overnight for a fresh start the next day. 
** Battery life estimates based on tests run on prototype model.
 
Wireless Charging
Do away with messy cords with the bundled Qi wireless charging pad to charge your Qi-enabled devices.

 
 
Reacts to the Environment 
Oboo dims its display when it’s time for bed so you can get the restful sleep that you need. 

Hidden inside is an ambient light sensor that monitors the levels of light in the room, allowing Oboo to know when the display needs to shine bright to be readable and when it needs to be dim to not impact your sleep.
 
Automatic Time Adjustment
Never forget to fall backward or spring forward for daylight savings time again. Oboo uses the Network Time Protocol to make sure the time and date are always set correctly.
Oboo uses those same smarts and WiFi based geolocation to automatically update the current time and the time of your alarms when travelling.
 
Smart Home
Oboo is Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant ready so you can tell your Amazon Echo or Google Home when you would like to wake up and it will update your Oboo.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting our project. We hope that after reading this text you will get involved in our mission and you will help us spreading EDIE to the world.</p>
<p>""<em>EDIE is an unusual approach to light design. We exploited dielectric fluid which gives us opportunity to accentuate the beauty and symbolic character of classic Edison bulb. EDIE opens almost endless universe of shapes to explore. Edie could be made from combination of glass, wood, silicone, metal and other materials. The glass can have awesome shapes, surfaces and structures. This lamp can be everything from table lamp to outdoor statue. The only limit is imagination.</em>""</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://auradesign.cz/indiegogo/indie_edie_1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Petr. I love IT, science and geeky things. Misa, beside being the sun-of-my-life, is great and creative designer. We found out that my technical knowledge and Misa's design skills are perfect match. Together we started nearly year ago a company called Aura Design (<a href=""http://auradesign.cz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">auradesign.cz</a>) because we decided that we want to do something amusing for the living. However we work on our things in our free time and the company is still not making any money so we are more like some design startup.</p>
<p>EDIE was born as a birthday gift for Misa nearly two years ago. The idea was to make the bulb looking like it is floating in the air. I know that there are some solutions based on so called ""levitrons"", but the construction is complicated and the design is limited. So the decision was to explore other possibilities and it turned out that there are dielectric fluids which are perfect for this purpose. When everything was in its place and EDIE was switched on for the first time it was lovely. The light forms beautiful aura around the bulb, the bulb moves and creates reflections on the walls just like summer sun on the water.</p>
<p>And so the first EDIE was created. After some time and very positive feedback from our friends we decided that it is worth trying to make it to production. We are working on production prototype for more than a year now and we still have a long way before us. And as you know, everything is easier if you have enough funding. So here we are.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://auradesign.cz/indiegogo/indie_edie_3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><em>Experiments. The left one is for testing of cylinder container (production will look more like on visualisation), the right one is made from raw glass and raw wood.</em></p>
<h3>Why we named it EDIE?</h3>
<p>The name of the lamp, EDIE, comes from the Edison bulb which was used in the first prototype. The bulb has also a symbolic character. It is a symbol for new ideas, thoughs, inventions and originality. And also it is very nice design and it is a pity that in most lamps this light source is hidden. EDIE is different, because the bulb is the main design element and the container is here only to accentuate its beauty.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://auradesign.cz/indiegogo/indie_edie_5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<div>We tried to keep the technical solution as simple as possible. There is only few main components:<br/><p><strong>Light source:</strong> The heart of EDIE. It can be almost anything from incandescent bulb to LED, the only limitation is the produced heat, which should not exceed certain values. There can be various shapes, sizes and technologies. It is, of course, possible to have more than one source of light in one container. The bulb is placed in our custom made ""invisible"" bulb holder so it is replaceable. The wires which leads to the bulb holder are so thin, that they are almost invisible.</p>
<p>The incandescent bulbs got banned in the EU (yet we have some on the stock :), but in more rational countries they can be used freely. Fortunately, the halogen bulbs will be available in EU for next few years and they also look very good in EDIE. But the best part is that you don't have worry about the availability of bulbs. Because the bulb is effectively cooled it has much longer lifetime - the first prototype is still in use with the original bulb!</p>
<p><strong>Container:</strong> The skin of EDIE. The container gives EDIE its outer shape. Primarily we use handcrafted glass because here, in Czech Republic, it has a long tradition and because of its properties. The container can be of any size and shape, it can be coloured, cut or made from various types of glass. The container influence the properties of the light and there is whole universe of possibilities to explore.</p>

<h3>How the funding will be used?</h3>
<p>As it was told earlier we are more like design startup. We use our own money to develop and test. It is very expensive for us and everything takes much longer than it should. The funding will be used for several goals:</p>
<p><strong>Certification:</strong> In order to be allowed to sell EDIE on the market we need to pass a series of tests to get the CE certificate. These tests are expensive and because of EDIE's original construction they will be complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Starting of serial production:</strong> We have tested almost all components which we need for production except the stand. We are now in the phase of prototyping and it will not be easy. It is the most complicated part of the lamp and the development will be expensive. We need three different forms and each costs about 500€. After we will finish the stand and pass the certification we may start the serial production. Of course it is better if you order bigger amount of every part from the supplier but this means to have lot of money for the initial investment.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing:</strong> We know that the product itself is not enough. We need to tell the people about it. Advertisement and marketing could be insanely expensive. Of course we don't want to spend some excessive amount of money on advertising, but it will be easier to sell EDIE if we will have some funds to afford some marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Development of other EDIE:</strong> If EDIE will find its customers and bring us some money we want to develop another series. Most probably it will be the block one. It is looking better but the form for container is insanely expensive (yes, it is lot easier to make rotary objects from glass than cubes or blocks). <strong>Let us know in the comments which shape you like most! ;)<br/></strong></p>

Thank you for visiting our project. We hope that after reading this text you will get involved in our mission and you will help us spreading EDIE to the world.
""EDIE is an unusual approach to light design. We exploited dielectric fluid which gives us opportunity to accentuate the beauty and symbolic character of classic Edison bulb. EDIE opens almost endless universe of shapes to explore. Edie could be made from combination of glass, wood, silicone, metal and other materials. The glass can have awesome shapes, surfaces and structures. This lamp can be everything from table lamp to outdoor statue. The only limit is imagination.""

The Story
Hi, my name is Petr. I love IT, science and geeky things. Misa, beside being the sun-of-my-life, is great and creative designer. We found out that my technical knowledge and Misa's design skills are perfect match. Together we started nearly year ago a company called Aura Design (auradesign.cz) because we decided that we want to do something amusing for the living. However we work on our things in our free time and the company is still not making any money so we are more like some design startup.
EDIE was born as a birthday gift for Misa nearly two years ago. The idea was to make the bulb looking like it is floating in the air. I know that there are some solutions based on so called ""levitrons"", but the construction is complicated and the design is limited. So the decision was to explore other possibilities and it turned out that there are dielectric fluids which are perfect for this purpose. When everything was in its place and EDIE was switched on for the first time it was lovely. The light forms beautiful aura around the bulb, the bulb moves and creates reflections on the walls just like summer sun on the water.
And so the first EDIE was created. After some time and very positive feedback from our friends we decided that it is worth trying to make it to production. We are working on production prototype for more than a year now and we still have a long way before us. And as you know, everything is easier if you have enough funding. So here we are.

Experiments. The left one is for testing of cylinder container (production will look more like on visualisation), the right one is made from raw glass and raw wood.
Why we named it EDIE?
The name of the lamp, EDIE, comes from the Edison bulb which was used in the first prototype. The bulb has also a symbolic character. It is a symbol for new ideas, thoughs, inventions and originality. And also it is very nice design and it is a pity that in most lamps this light source is hidden. EDIE is different, because the bulb is the main design element and the container is here only to accentuate its beauty.


How does it work?
We tried to keep the technical solution as simple as possible. There is only few main components:Light source: The heart of EDIE. It can be almost anything from incandescent bulb to LED, the only limitation is the produced heat, which should not exceed certain values. There can be various shapes, sizes and technologies. It is, of course, possible to have more than one source of light in one container. The bulb is placed in our custom made ""invisible"" bulb holder so it is replaceable. The wires which leads to the bulb holder are so thin, that they are almost invisible.
The incandescent bulbs got banned in the EU (yet we have some on the stock :), but in more rational countries they can be used freely. Fortunately, the halogen bulbs will be available in EU for next few years and they also look very good in EDIE. But the best part is that you don't have worry about the availability of bulbs. Because the bulb is effectively cooled it has much longer lifetime - the first prototype is still in use with the original bulb!
Container: The skin of EDIE. The container gives EDIE its outer shape. Primarily we use handcrafted glass because here, in Czech Republic, it has a long tradition and because of its properties. The container can be of any size and shape, it can be coloured, cut or made from various types of glass. The container influence the properties of the light and there is whole universe of possibilities to explore.
Liquid: The blood od EDIE. We are testing number of dielectric liquids, but the best results we have wit the transformer oil. It is non toxic and very stable oil widely used in electric devices which needs good cooling.
Stand: The stand is here mainly for safety reasons. It connects EDIE to electric current and it contains safety measures to avoid injuries when manipulating with EDIE. This part is necessary because of regulations for electric devices. It can be made from various material like rubber, plastic, wood or metal. The stand is intended for the serial production version, custom made lamps may use different solution.
We have our solution patented so you can be sure that you will always get the original in perfect quality.

How the funding will be used?
As it was told earlier we are more like design startup. We use our own money to develop and test. It is very expensive for us and everything takes much longer than it should. The funding will be used for several goals:
Certification: In order to be allowed to sell EDIE on the market we need to pass a series of tests to get the CE certificate. These tests are expensive and because of EDIE's original construction they will be complicated.
Starting of serial production: We have tested almost all components which we need for production except the stand. We are now in the phase of prototyping and it will not be easy. It is the most complicated part of the lamp and the development will be expensive. We need three different forms and each costs about 500€. After we will finish the stand and pass the certification we may start the serial production. Of course it is better if you order bigger amount of every part from the supplier but this means to have lot of money for the initial investment.
Marketing: We know that the product itself is not enough. We need to tell the people about it. Advertisement and marketing could be insanely expensive. Of course we don't want to spend some excessive amount of money on advertising, but it will be easier to sell EDIE if we will have some funds to afford some marketing.
Development of other EDIE: If EDIE will find its customers and bring us some money we want to develop another series. Most probably it will be the block one. It is looking better but the form for container is insanely expensive (yes, it is lot easier to make rotary objects from glass than cubes or blocks). Let us know in the comments which shape you like most! ;)

<p><strong>THE NEED!</strong></p>
<p>People everywhere struggle with heat, humidity, hot flashes, and overheating; especially the handicapped; people struggling with diseases such as MS (Multiple Sclerosis), Cancer, and Lupus to name a few. Our awsome troops defending our freedom and liberty fight the heat and humidity all over the world. Our wounded warriors espcially have trouble dealing with extreem heat.  The elderly and small children and infants also struggle with heat and can even have life treating heat illiness. Little did we know that we created a product to make all their lives a little better and safer. </p>
<p>Countless times we have specifically seen children in wheelchairs trying to enjoy a sporting event only to see them struggling in the heat.  We give them a cool Frosty Towel® and their face lights up, they smile, and later on we receive an email telling us how the Frosty Towel® made their day...it helps make their day more livable…and that is something we all should cherish.</p>
<p>We have seen the same thing over and over with our heroes – our wounded warriors – struggling with the heat at an event and once they receive a Frosty Towel®, they say “WOW that feels great, thank you so much”.  </p>
<p>It is a blessing to get a call, an email, or a letter from cancer patients that tells how Frosty Towel® helps them get through the bad days of the debilitating results of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>We have also received letters from our troops overseas defending our freedom time and time again, saying how grateful they were when they returned from their mission in the deserts of Iraq or Afghanistan to see a care package full of Frosty Towel®.  They say it made their day and put a smile on everyone’s face. Frosty towels helped make a difference.</p>
<p>On and on we could go with the wonderful testimonials we have received hearing back from people that have used the Frosty Towel® in the worst of situations and conditions to help them beat the heat, humidity, and hot flashes associated with whatever they are struggling with.  </p>
<p>This is why we need your help.  This is why we need your support.  When we started our business and invented the Frosty Towel® we had no idea the magnitude of the need, and how the Frosty Towel® truly meets this need, and solves this problem. </p>
<p>With your donations over $100.00, not only will you receive a gift, we will send Frosty Towels (in your name if you like) to your choice of Make a Wish Foundation (help children in the heat living out their wish), to our troops, or American Cancer Society (please see perks).</p>
<p>We ask you a very simple question.  When was the last time you were standing in line for 30 plus minutes in 90 plus degree weather, or sitting in the stands at an event in extremely hot weather and high humidity drinking tons of water and still feeling like your were going pass out in the heat?  Well this is the need that Frosty Towel® has solved for people like you and for folks like we mentioned above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please help us help others beat the heat, and enjoy life a little more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dream coming true:<br/></strong></p>
<p>Seven years ago my wife and I decided to make a major change in our lives and reach for the Amercian dream. So I retired from a long and blessed career from Home Depot and came home to spend more time with my family and build a business.  Just right before the down turn in the US ecomony we started A Quiver Full, Inc. It was at that time we developed our US patented all natural cooling towel that we call Frosty Towel®.  Little did we know that we had solved one of the world's most basic needs of beating the heat and humidity. We had no idea that we would be affecting peoples lives in such a postive way as written above.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is a real true Amercian dream coming true.  That is why we are reaching out to you.  We are so humbled by the reception and growth of the Frosty Towel®.  For us to succeed any further we need your support, your help, and your time to read the rest of the story.  We would be very grateful if you would support us and the Frosty Towel®, and become part of the team and the dream.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THE BUSINESS OF A QUIVER FULL INC</span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>The </strong><strong>Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup></strong></p>
<p>A Quiver Full, Inc. has developed a patented, innovative, high-quality <em>Polar Fresh™ Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup></em>, that has solved some very important needs at places like Disney World.  Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> is an all-natural cooling towel that refreshes and relieves the user from heat, humidity, and hot flashes as it naturally softens and moisturizes the skin. The Frosty Towel<sup>® </sup>cooling towel is made with a proprietary blend of eco-friendly, all-natural oils, and extracts that cause the towel to quickly cool down without refrigeration. As an added bonus, the unique formula naturally repels biting insects, such as mosquitoes while providing a pleasing citrus scent.  Each Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> cooling towel is individually wrapped and has a two-year shelf life. The product is made of 100% premium natural cotton or non-woven cotton fabrics. The Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> cooling towel maintains its refreshing effect for four to six hours, or more, depending upon heat, humidity, or wind conditions (it might even be used for days). The towels are made in several sizes and colors and can be customized with any company logo or image.                                  </p>
<p>A Quiver Full, Inc. received written notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office in the spring of 2012 and is now protected under <strong>US Patent Number 8182826</strong> with additional patents pending.  As of 12-22-12 we were notified by the US Patent Office that we have also received allowances on additional claims we filed and we expect additional patent numbers to be issued in late May or early June 2013.  A Quiver Full, Inc. has applied for a patent, titled “Refreshment Towel and Applied Solution,” U.S. Patent Publication No.  US2009-0068239A1.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Frosty Towel Solves a Real Problem Encountered by Every Human</span></strong></p>
<p>We have solved one of the world’s biggest needs: <em>staying cooler to beat the heat and the humidity while outside</em>.  This is critical, if you have ever been outside at Disney World standing in line when it is hot or at a sporting evening sitting in the sun, you know how uncomfortable the heat can be.  No amount of drinks will cool you down; they only satisfy your thirst. Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> is the patented solution that solves the need throughout the world to be cool and refreshed.  We have a vision for the Frosty Towel<sup>®.  </sup>It could be the next Gatorade <sup>®</sup>. </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">History and Growth</span></strong> </p>
<p>The Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> cooling towel is sold through distributors, sales reps, as well as sold directly to some major accounts. </p>
<p>Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> went to market first in the promotional industry.  This is an eighteen billion dollar industry. The customizable nature of the product makes it especially appealing to the promotional industry where sales have grown each year thus far.     </p>

<p>A Quiver Full, Inc. has established credibility in the promotional industry by building a strong presence for Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> at Disney World<sup>®</sup>. With over 45 million guests each year, Disney World® holds a huge opportunity for Frosty Towel<sup>®.</sup>  Disney World<sup>®</sup> has purchased tens of thousands of Frosty Towels through Barker Specialty.  As of August 2012, Disney World<sup>®</sup> has made the decision to add Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> to their retail product offering in their Orlando Parks through StarLight Creations, Inc.   We are in over 100 retail location in Disney World theme parks and resorts in Florida.                                          </p>

<p>In 2009, Walgreens’ Florida stores performed a limited market test. The test generated sales of 68 units per store per month in 35 Florida stores during a three-month test (approximately 5,000 units sold), beating Walgreens’ expectations by 36%. In 2010 and 2011, A Quiver Full, Inc. expanded Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> distribution to 17 states and more than 250 Walgreens stores.

<p> In 2011, the Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> also made its debut as a premier vendor item at select NASCAR events through SMI Properties, the licensing and merchandising arm of Speedway Motorsports, Inc.(SMI).  In August 2012 we broke our sales record for both Bristol Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway.  At Atlanta Motor Speedway over the Labor Day weekend, we doubled the sales of all other outside vendors.  SMI has requested that we expand to 5 to 6 races for 2013.    </p>

<p>In the spring of 2012, Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> was added to four Six Flags<sup>®</sup> amusement parks, including Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags White Water. We did a full roll-out at Six Flags Over Georgia as a test.  We were in 23 retail locations inside the park.  We exceeded all expectations. A Quiver Full, Inc. is working with Six Flags Corporation to develop a 2014 marketing campaign to sell the Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> at all nineteen (19) of the Six Flags amusement parks.  As of January 24 2013 we have already received opening purchase orders from Six Flags, as they are expanding to 6 parks.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How Will </span></strong><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Frosty Towel<sup>®  </sup>Grow?</span></strong></p>
<p>A Quiver Full, Inc. was started in the fall of 2006, as a cottage industry/lifestyle business. Once the Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup> had been in the market place for several years, it became apparent that the potential was there for A Quiver Full, Inc. and Frosty Towel<sup>® </sup>to become a wealth generating global company.  This is the decision at hand.  We desire to move beyond a small cottage industry business and become a strong wealth building company.  A Quiver Full, Inc. has operated on a break-even basis incurring operating losses in some years and profits in others. The Frosty Towel<sup>® </sup>is fully developed and is being aggressively marketed. The detailed formulas of the Frosty Towel<sup>® </sup>are trade secrets.  </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Jeff Foxworthy and Foxworthy Outdoors</span></strong> </p>
<p>In March of 2012, A Quiver Full, Inc. began discussions with Foxworthy Outdoors for a national branding program and sales product representation, as well as a licensing agreement with Jeff Foxworthy.  This has now been completed. We are excited about the potential this holds and we are already seeing new doors opening and new deals closing.    </p>
<p>Foxworthy Outdoors is a rep group for products endorsed by Jeff Foxworthy or co-branded with Jeff Foxworthy, including the Frosty Towel<sup>®</sup>.   Recently Jacob Grant &amp; Associates, which is a rep group comprised of more than 50 experienced long-time sales associates, was acquired by Foxworthy Outdoors. They have over 20 years of sales experience in the retail industry in excess of $100,000,000. The founder of Jacob Grant &amp; Associates, Jacob Grant, is a member of A Quiver Full, Inc.’s advisory board. Mr. Grant now has the title of Executive Vice President of sales of Foxworthy Outdoors. </p>
<p>As a result of this relationship with Foxworthy Outdoors, we have already been added to web base retailers for late 2012 into 2013 such as Amazon.com, Costco.com, and Walgreens.com for a total of over 29 websites.  We just received notification from the buyer at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond that we have been set up for 2013.  We have also been added to Big Y Groceries in the North East for 2013.  </p>
<p>Here are a few of the retailers that are currently in final stage meetings with:  CVS, Walgreens (national distribution), Ace, Tru-Value, and Race Track. </p>

We ask you a very simple question.  When was the last time you were standing in line for 30 plus minutes in 90 plus degree weather, or sitting in the stands at an event in extremely hot weather and high humidity drinking tons of water and still feeling like your were going pass out in the heat?  Well this is the need that Frosty Towel® has solved for people like you and for folks like we mentioned above.
 
Please help us help others beat the heat, and enjoy life a little more.
The Dream coming true:
Seven years ago my wife and I decided to make a major change in our lives and reach for the Amercian dream. So I retired from a long and blessed career from Home Depot and came home to spend more time with my family and build a business.  Just right before the down turn in the US ecomony we started A Quiver Full, Inc. It was at that time we developed our US patented all natural cooling towel that we call Frosty Towel®.  Little did we know that we had solved one of the world's most basic needs of beating the heat and humidity. We had no idea that we would be affecting peoples lives in such a postive way as written above.
The rest of the story is a real true Amercian dream coming true.  That is why we are reaching out to you.  We are so humbled by the reception and growth of the Frosty Towel®.  For us to succeed any further we need your support, your help, and your time to read the rest of the story.  We would be very grateful if you would support us and the Frosty Towel®, and become part of the team and the dream.

THE BUSINESS OF A QUIVER FULL INC 
The Frosty Towel®
A Quiver Full, Inc. has developed a patented, innovative, high-quality Polar Fresh™ Frosty Towel®, that has solved some very important needs at places like Disney World.  Frosty Towel® is an all-natural cooling towel that refreshes and relieves the user from heat, humidity, and hot flashes as it naturally softens and moisturizes the skin. The Frosty Towel® cooling towel is made with a proprietary blend of eco-friendly, all-natural oils, and extracts that cause the towel to quickly cool down without refrigeration. As an added bonus, the unique formula naturally repels biting insects, such as mosquitoes while providing a pleasing citrus scent.  Each Frosty Towel® cooling towel is individually wrapped and has a two-year shelf life. The product is made of 100% premium natural cotton or non-woven cotton fabrics. The Frosty Towel® cooling towel maintains its refreshing effect for four to six hours, or more, depending upon heat, humidity, or wind conditions (it might even be used for days). The towels are made in several sizes and colors and can be customized with any company logo or image.                                  
A Quiver Full, Inc. received written notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office in the spring of 2012 and is now protected under US Patent Number 8182826 with additional patents pending.  As of 12-22-12 we were notified by the US Patent Office that we have also received allowances on additional claims we filed and we expect additional patent numbers to be issued in late May or early June 2013.  A Quiver Full, Inc. has applied for a patent, titled “Refreshment Towel and Applied Solution,” U.S. Patent Publication No.  US2009-0068239A1.
Frosty Towel Solves a Real Problem Encountered by Every Human
We have solved one of the world’s biggest needs: staying cooler to beat the heat and the humidity while outside.  This is critical, if you have ever been outside at Disney World standing in line when it is hot or at a sporting evening sitting in the sun, you know how uncomfortable the heat can be.  No amount of drinks will cool you down; they only satisfy your thirst. Frosty Towel® is the patented solution that solves the need throughout the world to be cool and refreshed.  We have a vision for the Frosty Towel®.  It could be the next Gatorade ®. 
History and Growth 
The Frosty Towel® cooling towel is sold through distributors, sales reps, as well as sold directly to some major accounts. 
Frosty Towel® went to market first in the promotional industry.  This is an eighteen billion dollar industry. The customizable nature of the product makes it especially appealing to the promotional industry where sales have grown each year thus far.     
                                     
A Quiver Full, Inc. has established credibility in the promotional industry by building a strong presence for Frosty Towel® at Disney World®. With over 45 million guests each year, Disney World® holds a huge opportunity for Frosty Towel®.  Disney World® has purchased tens of thousands of Frosty Towels through Barker Specialty.  As of August 2012, Disney World® has made the decision to add Frosty Towel® to their retail product offering in their Orlando Parks through StarLight Creations, Inc.   We are in over 100 retail location in Disney World theme parks and resorts in Florida.                                          
 
Through independent multi-line sales representatives, A Quiver Full, Inc. has successfully built key relationships with leading promotional distributors, as well as raised brand awareness and built inroads with some of the most well-known brands in the nation, including major league sports teams, Chick-fil-a, UPS, Chevrolet, FedEx, and others.   
In 2009, Walgreens’ Florida stores performed a limited market test. The test generated sales of 68 units per store per month in 35 Florida stores during a three-month test (approximately 5,000 units sold), beating Walgreens’ expectations by 36%. In 2010 and 2011, A Quiver Full, Inc. expanded Frosty Towel® distribution to 17 states and more than 250 Walgreens stores. Walgreens is now expanding the Frosty Towel® program into as many stores as A Quiver Full, Inc. can supply.  For 2013 the product has been activated in 1,500 Walgreens stores in their system. With more than 8,800 locations in the United States, Walgreens provides a significant national distribution channel for Frosty Towel®. At this time, Foxworthy Outdoors is meeting with Walgreens for national distribution of Frosty Towel® via Walgreens Distribution centers for 2014.   
 
                                
 In 2011, the Frosty Towel® also made its debut as a premier vendor item at select NASCAR events through SMI Properties, the licensing and merchandising arm of Speedway Motorsports, Inc.(SMI).  In August 2012 we broke our sales record for both Bristol Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway.  At Atlanta Motor Speedway over the Labor Day weekend, we doubled the sales of all other outside vendors.  SMI has requested that we expand to 5 to 6 races for 2013.    
                                       
In the spring of 2012, Frosty Towel® was added to four Six Flags® amusement parks, including Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags White Water. We did a full roll-out at Six Flags Over Georgia as a test.  We were in 23 retail locations inside the park.  We exceeded all expectations. A Quiver Full, Inc. is working with Six Flags Corporation to develop a 2014 marketing campaign to sell the Frosty Towel® at all nineteen (19) of the Six Flags amusement parks.  As of January 24 2013 we have already received opening purchase orders from Six Flags, as they are expanding to 6 parks.

 
How Will Frosty Towel®  Grow?
A Quiver Full, Inc. was started in the fall of 2006, as a cottage industry/lifestyle business. Once the Frosty Towel® had been in the market place for several years, it became apparent that the potential was there for A Quiver Full, Inc. and Frosty Towel® to become a wealth generating global company.  This is the decision at hand.  We desire to move beyond a small cottage industry business and become a strong wealth building company.  A Quiver Full, Inc. has operated on a break-even basis incurring operating losses in some years and profits in others. The Frosty Towel® is fully developed and is being aggressively marketed. The detailed formulas of the Frosty Towel® are trade secrets.  
Jeff Foxworthy and Foxworthy Outdoors 
In March of 2012, A Quiver Full, Inc. began discussions with Foxworthy Outdoors for a national branding program and sales product representation, as well as a licensing agreement with Jeff Foxworthy.  This has now been completed. We are excited about the potential this holds and we are already seeing new doors opening and new deals closing.    
Foxworthy Outdoors is a rep group for products endorsed by Jeff Foxworthy or co-branded with Jeff Foxworthy, including the Frosty Towel®.   Recently Jacob Grant & Associates, which is a rep group comprised of more than 50 experienced long-time sales associates, was acquired by Foxworthy Outdoors. They have over 20 years of sales experience in the retail industry in excess of $100,000,000. The founder of Jacob Grant & Associates, Jacob Grant, is a member of A Quiver Full, Inc.’s advisory board. Mr. Grant now has the title of Executive Vice President of sales of Foxworthy Outdoors. 
As a result of this relationship with Foxworthy Outdoors, we have already been added to web base retailers for late 2012 into 2013 such as Amazon.com, Costco.com, and Walgreens.com for a total of over 29 websites.  We just received notification from the buyer at Bed Bath & Beyond that we have been set up for 2013.  We have also been added to Big Y Groceries in the North East for 2013.  
Here are a few of the retailers that are currently in final stage meetings with:  CVS, Walgreens (national distribution), Ace, Tru-Value, and Race Track. 
Foxworthy Outdoors is in ongoing meetings with the follow companies for 2014 as well:  Kroger, Publix, Bass Pro, Sports Authority, Costco, 7-11, Dicks, Cabelas, and Academy Sports…(these are companies that they have met with the buyers).
Additional Distribution and Future Growth 
A Quiver Full, Inc. is also working with some of the leading retail industry distributors and representatives such as Hudson News and Big Rock Sports with the potential to expand Frosty Towel® distribution to many more major national and regional retail chains.

<p>Bide your
time? Not here. Neither seller nor buyer have to wait around. Time flies and
both can make an excellent deal with more fun! </p>
<p></p>
<p>You as a <b>seller have no financial
risk</b> as there are no fees - no start fees, no optional advertising fees - till
the product is sold. With the sale a very low 5,5% commission applies. <b>Simple,
easy, fair</b>. The turnover of products takes off due to the quicker sales that
happen due to flexible auction time. It can be minutes instead of days or
weeks. The end price can go through the roof with buyer demand. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You as a <b>buyer can finally influence
the progress of the auction</b> by changing the price or the time factor. <b>Price and
time are interdependent</b>. The buyer can set the end point of the auction to
whatever time suits him – across time zones -. He strategically moves the price
or the time. If the price is right he can end the auction by buying the product
immediately. Depending on market demand and the number of bids the end price
may move up or down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buyer and seller receive a fair and
a quick deal that will give them savings and puts money in their banks.</p>

<p>We made time flexible during the auction. Now YOU can <b>manipulate time</b>! Although
you actually buy a product, you purchase time units. This way each bid reduces
the remaining online time of an auction moving the future end point ever closer
to the present. <b>Changing the time will change the price, changing the price
will change the time. </b>A user can bid strategically or can buy the whole
remaining time and thereby finish the auction. A special algorithm will let <b>the
end price move up or down</b> depending of the number of bids and on market demand.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are into being fair.
That’s why there are absolutely <b>no fees for the seller until he sells his
product.</b> As a seller you finally have no financial risk
and you have faster turnover. As a buyer you can get what you want when you
want it. No waiting around for anyone.</p>

YABID. Eliminating the weaknesses of other
auction systems. It’s easier, faster, fairer and more profitable. The bidding system works according to
classic auction principles yet makes buying and selling simple, exiciting and
speeds it up. The length of the
auction shortens with each bid. You can move the end of the auction from the
future into the present or you can finish the auction anytime. You are in control with yabid.net.






Bide your
time? Not here. Neither seller nor buyer have to wait around. Time flies and
both can make an excellent deal with more fun! 

You as a seller have no financial
risk as there are no fees - no start fees, no optional advertising fees - till
the product is sold. With the sale a very low 5,5% commission applies. Simple,
easy, fair. The turnover of products takes off due to the quicker sales that
happen due to flexible auction time. It can be minutes instead of days or
weeks. The end price can go through the roof with buyer demand. 

You as a buyer can finally influence
the progress of the auction by changing the price or the time factor. Price and
time are interdependent. The buyer can set the end point of the auction to
whatever time suits him – across time zones -. He strategically moves the price
or the time. If the price is right he can end the auction by buying the product
immediately. Depending on market demand and the number of bids the end price
may move up or down.

Buyer and seller receive a fair and
a quick deal that will give them savings and puts money in their banks.

    





We made time flexible during the auction. Now YOU can manipulate time! Although
you actually buy a product, you purchase time units. This way each bid reduces
the remaining online time of an auction moving the future end point ever closer
to the present. Changing the time will change the price, changing the price
will change the time. A user can bid strategically or can buy the whole
remaining time and thereby finish the auction. A special algorithm will let the
end price move up or down depending of the number of bids and on market demand.

We are into being fair.
That’s why there are absolutely no fees for the seller until he sells his
product. As a seller you finally have no financial risk
and you have faster turnover. As a buyer you can get what you want when you
want it. No waiting around for anyone.



Embedded into this auction
format we created 3 ways of selling. We took into account the requirements for
different products and varied calculations:




           






We started this platform with you, the buyer and
seller, in mind. Now we need your support to make it all happen. 

We need the funds in order to bring YABID into the
mobile world, improve usability, to add features in the user account, increase
features on the presentation page, update photo/video presentation, pep up the
design, offer it in selected countries and the US adding other currencies
(complying with regulation in other countries) and implement other languages,
improve handling of fees after selling, program integration with merchant
platforms and their interfaces, connect current auctions to social media,
increase support activity, expand the user profile. 

Please give us your donation so that we can give you
the improved alternative platform to do business early 2014.




Do you have time to sit around for the final seconds
of an auction at a predetermined time or do you have to catch a plane, take
care of the kids or are just too tired to stay up? Who was in control? Well, it was not you! Frustrated? NOW with Yabid YOU decide!
Often the simplest things are the hardest to figure
out. We wanted to add usefulness, service and convenience for both buyer and
seller. And there it was: “Time is money”. So we simply connected money and
time.

<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
<p>At <i><b>mui</b></i> Lab, many of our team members are in our late 30s and early 40s and have busy family lives. We all struggle to balance our precious family time with the demands of technology. Instead of playing and talking with our children, we found ourselves glued to our phones and computers, desperately trying to “connect” with others. This saddened our children and disconnects us from our spouses.</p>

<p>Whenever leaving the office late at night, I send a good night message to <i><b>mui</b></i> for my 7-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter. That always makes them happy.  </p>
<p>My daughter is mesmerized by the light slide dimmer switch that appears on <i><b>mui</b></i>.

Her brother wants his turn, too. They fight for the switch and never seem to get tired of playing with it.</p>
<p>My wife’s approach to <i><b>mui</b></i> is more practical. She wanted to be able to turn off the last light from inside her bed at night. So, I used <i><b>mui</b></i>’s settings to make it happen for her.</p>
<p>She likes having <i><b>mui</b></i> within arms’ reach, so she can easily check the weather forecast in the morning when deciding what to wear.</p>
<p>We use a beta version of <i><b>mui</b></i> in our house. When I was removing <i><b>mui</b></i> to update it the other day, our kids had worried looks on their faces and asked: “Are we losing <i><b>mui</b></i>?” Apparently, <i><b>mui </b></i>became a necessity for my son.</p>

OUR STORY
At mui Lab, many of our team members are in our late 30s and early 40s and have busy family lives. We all struggle to balance our precious family time with the demands of technology. Instead of playing and talking with our children, we found ourselves glued to our phones and computers, desperately trying to “connect” with others. This saddened our children and disconnects us from our spouses.

Personal Stories    
mui in Hirobe’s home | Nobuyasu Hirobe (Co-Founder, Creative Director) 
Hirobe
Whenever leaving the office late at night, I send a good night message to mui for my 7-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter. That always makes them happy.  
My daughter is mesmerized by the light slide dimmer switch that appears on mui. She slides it back and forth over and over, trying to figure out how the lighting in the room is connected to mui, turning the lights up and down every time she moves her little fingers. Her brother wants his turn, too. They fight for the switch and never seem to get tired of playing with it.
My wife’s approach to mui is more practical. She wanted to be able to turn off the last light from inside her bed at night. So, I used mui’s settings to make it happen for her.
She likes having mui within arms’ reach, so she can easily check the weather forecast in the morning when deciding what to wear.
We use a beta version of mui in our house. When I was removing mui to update it the other day, our kids had worried looks on their faces and asked: “Are we losing mui?” Apparently, mui became a necessity for my son.
mui Lab’s Creative Director Nobu Hirobe was thinking about mui being in a public gathering place when developing the concept for the device. He believed people, not the device, need to be the focus of the space.
mui at Oki’s home | Kaz Oki (Co-Founder, CEO)
Oki
My wife often comes home late from work. Exhausted and ready to “unplug,” she turns to “mui-san” (the nickname for mui in our household) to get done only what she wants and nothing more. For example, the weather forecast would quickly appear on mui and then disappear, letting us gently slip into dreamland. She loves having just the right level of access to technology with mui-san, instead of the glowing phones we used to look at before going to bed.   
Because mui lets us to control the lighting and appliance from another part of the house, the layout of the home no longer dictates our behavior. But we still wanted more from mui, including an option to shut off all lights with a touch of a button. This prompted us to develop the “Do Not Disturb” feature, which keeps the device on airplane mode until the alarm goes off in the morning.
mui Lab’s CEO Kazunori Oki is a newlywed. His and his wife both lead busy professional lives and typically have just three hours together each day. Oki did not want to waste any part of those three hours looking at his phone. mui was a perfect solution to this problem, and helped the couple stay connected.
Conclusion
mui is designed to create a modern living and work space where humans can thrive without being conditioned by technology. The intention is to stop technology from continuously demanding our attention, pulling us away from our loved ones while we try to enjoy our personal time. We can be more mindful readers, more creative artists, better families, thanks to the boundaries mui sets around our personal space and time.
Our homes will undoubtedly grow “smarter” as technologies further advance. There will always be some level of gaps between how technology works and how humans are meant to live. Still, mui empowers people to live their lives in the way they want by minimizing technological barriers. We envision mui as a tool which will help you create your desirable lifestyle, just like your favorite furniture which you choose to design your living space.

However, its huge size and heavyweight might keep you hesitant about going green. That’s why we designed S+ Cutlery, the sturdy cutlery with incredibly lightweight! S+ Cutlery is made of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP), which weighs about 6 times less than stainless steel and 3 times less than titanium. This innovative cutlery is sturdy yet lightweight, toxin-free, and resistant to corrosion, making it the most ideal portable cutlery to help you go eco-friendly.However, there’s no need to worry about the durability of S+ Cutlery, for the material we selected makes our design extremely strong yet lightweight. Glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) is a composite material consisting of a polymer matrix that is reinforced with glass fibers. It results from bonding plastics and glass fiber thread together to mechanically enhance its durability.GFRP features its low weight at high mechanical strength, its reliable resistance against corrosion and chemicals, and the long life expectancy it comes with. It is commonly utilized nowadays in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and construction.Being strong and lightweight, GFRP is also ideal for making a cutlery set! S+ Cutlery takes pride in its high strength-to-weight ratio, and can certainly help you tackle your everyday cooking and eating. S+ Cutlery is sturdy and durable and will stay like new after years. It won't melt, bend, or crack with daily use and machine washing. S+ Cutlery is free of n-Hexane / Cadmium / Mercury / Lead / PBBs / PBDEs / DBP / BBP / DEHP / DIBP, so you won’t be consuming toxic elements when enjoying your favorite meal.S+ Cutlery has met the European Union’s RoHS standards.  S+ Cutlery SGS Testing Report (EU RoHS)Our product has also met the regulations required by the FDA.  S+ Cutlery SGS Testing Report (USA FDA) One of the benefits of GFRP is its low reaction to chemicals. Cut, scoop up, and fork up all kinds of food you enjoy without causing harm to the surface of S+ Cutlery. S+ Cutlery can withstand up to 110 °C (230 °F) but it does not conduct heat as efficiently as metal cutlery does; therefore, it is great for preparing dishes that require lots of stirring, such as soup or risotto. S+ Cutlery also complies with airline standards, so you can also carry it onto the airplane without problems. Cleaning S+ Cutlery is easier than ever. The cutlery set can be cleaned in your dishwasher, sparing you from all the scrubbing and washing. Even if you have to handwash the cutlery, you can easily get rid of the smell and sauce once and for all. You can dip your utensils into the deep-colored sauce and food, without worrying that the color dyeing your cutlery. Make sure that you don’t taste your lunch on your eating utensils when enjoying your dinner. Unlike the wooden and bamboo cutlery, S+ Cutlery is heat and impact resistant. Just leave it in the dishwasher or dryer after use and let the machines do the tedious washing. Functionality and design combined, the colorful S+ Cutlery is stylish, easy to carry, and provides you with ergonomic comforts. S+ Cutlery is tightly assembled with medical-grade 316 stainless steel, making it easier to tighten and loosen the screw connectors. The whole cutlery set weighs less than 100 grams, similar to the weight of a deck of poker cards or 20 US nickels. You can carry it easily to wherever your taste bud leads you.Putting S+Cutlery away is a breeze, and the whole cutlery set can fit snugly inside the carrying case. When you walk around, S+Cutlery won’t jangle as metal cutlery does, sparing you from the annoying and embarrassing noises.   The tip of the chopsticks have a non-slip texture, allowing you to enjoy sushi, ramen, and different Asian style food without problems, and making it easier for you to pick a bit and a sup.

From the first time I put LickerSticker on the wall and covered it in peanut butter, he was distracted from moving and was more interested in his treat than to notice I was cleaning his feet. I have since tried it in the tub, on the floor when I brush him, in the garage. I haven’t found a place that this hasn’t made brushing, washing, wiping or looking after him easier.

<p>Security checks are an unavoidable part of travelling and are absolutely necessary for our safety. In some countries, TSA’s standardised keys can securely unlock and re-lock travel locks on luggage pieces undergoing security checks. TSA agents are authorised to cut and dispose of any locks that can’t be unlocked using the TSA Master Keys. For this reason, the AirBolt will be fully compliant and TSA accepted. At AirBolt, we can understand that privacy is a concern for many. Be it TSA or anyone else, you may not like your luggage being opened without your consent. The fear is only too real when master key designs are nefariously leaked online. In a world’s first, the AirBolt is the only travel locking solution that allows you to revoke TSA access electronically. If you are travelling to or from a country that doesn’t use TSA standards, you shouldn’t need to have the AirBolt open using TSA Master Keys. TSA or not, you will also be able to see a detailed lock/unlock log showing when your AirBolt was opened: giving you full control and transparency over your lock.</p>

<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Risks and Challenges:</b><p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p>1. Moving from prototype to a full production can present unexpected challenges occasionally. At AirBolt, we aim to bring you’ll enjoy using and of upmost quality. So, if we encounter some unexpected issues, we would prefer to delay shipping just a tiny whiny bit, just so we get things perfect.</p>
<p>2. Quality Assurance: At AirBolt we endeavour to deliver a product of upmost quality and reliability. There is a slight chance that during our final stages of quality testing we may find that certain aspects and parameters will need to be tweaked to ensure you have great time using the AirBolt. However, doing so may cause unforeseen delays in shipping although we will try our best to mitigate this risk.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>1. Is this Bluetooth 4.2 Backwards Compatible?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Bluetooth 4.2 is fully backwards compatible on devices which run Bluetooth 4.0 LE or higher.</p>
<p><b>2. Is the AirBolt airline approved?</b></p>
<p>We’re closely working with TSA and other regulatory bodies to ensure we meet relevant legislative requirements for the AirBolt to be flight ready. The AirBolt also features a timed-Aeroplane mode that turns off the Bluetooth transmitter for a specified period of time.</p>
<p><b>3. Can I reset my backup button codes?</b></p>
<p>You sure can! Simply sign-in to the companion app and you can change a variety of privacy and security settings on your AirBolt- including your back up button code.</p>
<p><b>4. What devices will be supported?</b></p>
<p>At launch, most iOS or Android devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 or above will be compatible with the AirBolt. We will look into Windows Mobile later.</p>
<p><b>5. What happens if my phone battery dies or I lose my phone?</b></p>
<p>We understand that this is a very realistic scenario and the last thing you want is to be stranded at your destination with a dead battery and no way to unlock the AirBolt and access your luggage. To overcome this, we offer two solutions.</p>
<p>          1.  If you have access to another compatible iOS or Android device, you can                       simply download the AirBolt companion app and sign in with your details to unlock your AirBolt. Or,</p>
<p>         2. When you first set up your AirBolt, you will be given the opportunity to set a                  unique back up code: a button combination pattern that is stored locally on the AirBolt. You can unlock your AirBolt by pressing this combination on the AirBolt’s button pad without the use of a smartphone.</p>
<p><b>6. How secure is Bluetooth?</b></p>
<p>The AirBolt uses the latest Bluetooth LE chipset and is secured using industry leading AES 128-bit encryption which offers ample security for most users</p>
<p>Along with this, each AirBolt will a proprietary security on top . In short, we’ll be make full use of Bluetooth LE’s security features.</p>
<p><b>7. Is the app free?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The AirBolt companion app will be a completely free download for both iOS and Android platforms. To use the AirBolt, you must download the app first.</p>
<p><b>8. Can I reduce the range in which the AirBolt unlocks?</b></p>
<p>This feature will not available at launch. However, we will endeavour to introduce this feature over future app updates.</p>
<p><b>9. How does Crowdsourced Location Tracking work?</b></p>
<p>Crowdsourced GPS networks rely on your phone's location system. The way it works in a simple manner is, well lets suppose you lose your luggage (we hope not though, it's a pain) and you have locked your baggage with the AirBolt. Well, when someone with the AirBolt (or partner) app walks by, it can detect your AirBolt and send its information up anonymously. The ID of your AirBolt is then matched in our system and the location is updated for you to see. It's a great solution, especially as Airports are high density areas and there are millions of users on crowd-sourced networks we are aiming to tap into. No sim card needed, no extra on going costs!</p>
<p>Furthermore as mentioned, at this stage, we do not plan on creating an AirBolt proprietary network for our crowdsourced GPS. Instead, we’ll be working in partnership with other Smart Device Manufacturers to gain synergies and grow our networks exponentially. </p>
<strong>10. Can I use the AirBolt while using other Bluetooth devices?</strong><p>Yes. The AirBolt and most modern smartphones use the Bluetooth 4.0 or above protocol, which allows for connectivity with multiple devices. Your AirBolt will not come in the way of your sexy new Bluetooth headphones or any other Bluetooth enabled devices.</p>
<p><b>11. Is the AirBolt splash proof?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Slight rainfall shouldn't be a problem</p>

We’ve designed the AirBolt using a die-cast Zinc body along with a sturdy stainless steel rope that makes it extremely durable and rugged. The design of the AirBolt allows you to lock your luggage from one of three different zones, including a space to thread the rope through a zipper.

With the extraordinary amount of features, the AirBolt’s battery lasts for up to a year* under standard usage conditions. Furthermore, the AirBolt can be charged using a standard micro-USB cable that should be fairly easy to come by should you find your battery out of charge.Manual Unlocking DemoDemo of unlocking when in range and via the App.Range Finding Feature

Risks and Challenges: 
 
1. Moving from prototype to a full production can present unexpected challenges occasionally. At AirBolt, we aim to bring you’ll enjoy using and of upmost quality. So, if we encounter some unexpected issues, we would prefer to delay shipping just a tiny whiny bit, just so we get things perfect.
2. Quality Assurance: At AirBolt we endeavour to deliver a product of upmost quality and reliability. There is a slight chance that during our final stages of quality testing we may find that certain aspects and parameters will need to be tweaked to ensure you have great time using the AirBolt. However, doing so may cause unforeseen delays in shipping although we will try our best to mitigate this risk.
 
Frequently Asked Questions:
1. Is this Bluetooth 4.2 Backwards Compatible?
Yes. Bluetooth 4.2 is fully backwards compatible on devices which run Bluetooth 4.0 LE or higher.
2. Is the AirBolt airline approved?
We’re closely working with TSA and other regulatory bodies to ensure we meet relevant legislative requirements for the AirBolt to be flight ready. The AirBolt also features a timed-Aeroplane mode that turns off the Bluetooth transmitter for a specified period of time.
3. Can I reset my backup button codes?
You sure can! Simply sign-in to the companion app and you can change a variety of privacy and security settings on your AirBolt- including your back up button code.
4. What devices will be supported?
At launch, most iOS or Android devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 or above will be compatible with the AirBolt. We will look into Windows Mobile later.
5. What happens if my phone battery dies or I lose my phone?
We understand that this is a very realistic scenario and the last thing you want is to be stranded at your destination with a dead battery and no way to unlock the AirBolt and access your luggage. To overcome this, we offer two solutions.
          1.  If you have access to another compatible iOS or Android device, you can                       simply download the AirBolt companion app and sign in with your details to unlock your AirBolt. Or,
         2. When you first set up your AirBolt, you will be given the opportunity to set a                  unique back up code: a button combination pattern that is stored locally on the AirBolt. You can unlock your AirBolt by pressing this combination on the AirBolt’s button pad without the use of a smartphone.
6. How secure is Bluetooth?
The AirBolt uses the latest Bluetooth LE chipset and is secured using industry leading AES 128-bit encryption which offers ample security for most users
Along with this, each AirBolt will a proprietary security on top . In short, we’ll be make full use of Bluetooth LE’s security features.
7. Is the app free?
Yes. The AirBolt companion app will be a completely free download for both iOS and Android platforms. To use the AirBolt, you must download the app first.
8. Can I reduce the range in which the AirBolt unlocks?
This feature will not available at launch. However, we will endeavour to introduce this feature over future app updates.
9. How does Crowdsourced Location Tracking work?
Crowdsourced GPS networks rely on your phone's location system. The way it works in a simple manner is, well lets suppose you lose your luggage (we hope not though, it's a pain) and you have locked your baggage with the AirBolt. Well, when someone with the AirBolt (or partner) app walks by, it can detect your AirBolt and send its information up anonymously. The ID of your AirBolt is then matched in our system and the location is updated for you to see. It's a great solution, especially as Airports are high density areas and there are millions of users on crowd-sourced networks we are aiming to tap into. No sim card needed, no extra on going costs!
Furthermore as mentioned, at this stage, we do not plan on creating an AirBolt proprietary network for our crowdsourced GPS. Instead, we’ll be working in partnership with other Smart Device Manufacturers to gain synergies and grow our networks exponentially. 
10. Can I use the AirBolt while using other Bluetooth devices?Yes. The AirBolt and most modern smartphones use the Bluetooth 4.0 or above protocol, which allows for connectivity with multiple devices. Your AirBolt will not come in the way of your sexy new Bluetooth headphones or any other Bluetooth enabled devices.
11. Is the AirBolt splash proof?
Yes. Slight rainfall shouldn't be a problem

<h1>Security redefined</h1>
<p>It’s a troubling reality that most people in rental homes can't 
expect landlords to agree to a security installation and in the rare 
case the landlords give permission, it is just too expensive to 
contemplate.<br/></p>
<p>Piper changes this equation and provides millions of people the 
opportunity of a real solution and for the first time, one that is 
simple but powerful. And not just apartments, but any type of home or 
small business can benefit from the simplicity and power of Piper.</p>

<b>Home, away and vacation security modes</b> are created and 
monitored by simple to use rules. Record video, sound the siren or keep 
the system in stealth mode so you can quietly monitor the intruder.<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Motion and sound detection</b> - Piper will record a video and 
notify you if motion is detected or a loud sound occurs. It can even 
tell you when a smoke or fire alarm goes off.</p>
<p>Piper extends the performance of its security system by adding Z-Wave
 sensors or switches to security rules. Monitor doors and windows and 
turn lights on if an intruder enters your home.</p>

<h1>Piper's design</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/23555/files/20130820105537-Gallery.jpg?1377021337"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>Careful thought was put into designing an elegant product that will 
fit into your home's interior in a way that is discreet and appealing. <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Piper has a stunning, compact, two-toned form with brushed aluminum legs.</p>
<p>It can be mounted on your wall or placed on any surface at home - 
your desk, shelf, table, mantle place, window sill, counter, etc.</p>
<p>Piper’s base color is glossy white with grey accents. There is also a
 special all-black Piper edition which is one of the pledge levels.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>How does Piper work?</h1>
<p>Piper itself is an embedded Linux system running on an ARM processor.
 Since it uses Wi-Fi to connect with your home network, you are free to 
place it anywhere in your home to obtain the best possible video 
coverage. The Piper app connects directly back to Piper for most of its 
communication, whether you are on your home Wi-Fi, your work’s Wi-Fi or 
even a cellular connection.</p>
<p>Security and automation rules, settings and live video connections 
are all made directly to Piper itself, so your private data is not 
stored on our servers.This makes Piper smart since all rules are 
executed locally without reliance on your internet being active. That 
means that if you want the siren to go off when motion is detected, it 
will work regardless of internet connectivity.</p>
<p>The same is true for Z-Wave integration. Piper is a Z-Wave hub. Up to
 232 Z-Wave devices can be paired to Piper and rules can be based off of
 these external devices. Piper supports many of the mainstream Z-wave devices, and based on interest and support we will expand this list to include more esoteric devices as a stretch objective.</p>
<p>The cloud infrastructure provides Piper a place to store event 
videos, send various types of notifications and perform additional 
login/connection negotiation. When an event occurs, the video will be 
uploaded into our cloud system so that if something happens to Piper, 
you will still have access to it. Backups of your configuration are also
 stored in the cloud to allow easy migration to a new device, or 
restoring after a reset.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Encryption</h1>
<p>Piper only communicates with the mobile app and the cloud over SSL. This means your video, audio, and security 
data are secure and encrypted at all times. Furthermore, user access is authenticated.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/><h1>Blacksumac's partners</h1>
<p>Celestica is one of the largest Electronics Contract Manufacturers in
 the world. Blacksumac's hardware design team has been working with 
Celestica since 2012, producing and testing Piper prototypes and limited
 production runs. Celestica will also be producing Piper's mass 
production run soon.</p>
<p>Gibson Product Design has won design awards for the last 7 years at 
the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Blacksumac and Gibson 
collaborated on Piper's enclosure design and manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Blacksumac is part of the Z-Wave alliance along with hundreds of 
companies who work together to make automation easy and accessible. <br/></p>

Piper in the News








TechCrunch | Engadget | SlashGear | Digital Trends | CE Pro | Android Police | Gadget Review | Geeky Gadgets | Desire This | Hack Things | Ottawa Citizen | Techvibes | Geekster Labs | Macgasm | Automated Home

TechnologyPiper is a small, brilliant piece of technology that's packed with sensors.
 It works seamlessly with Android and iOS smartphones and tablets and 
can be paired with smart home accessories to keep you safe and in 
control.


Combining 
security, high quality video, and home automation just makes sense. You 
can’t get real peace of mind without actually seeing what’s happening at
 home, and the possibilities for making your home more secure and 
interactive really open up when you add automation to the equation.





Security redefined
It’s a troubling reality that most people in rental homes can't 
expect landlords to agree to a security installation and in the rare 
case the landlords give permission, it is just too expensive to 
contemplate.
Piper changes this equation and provides millions of people the 
opportunity of a real solution and for the first time, one that is 
simple but powerful. And not just apartments, but any type of home or 
small business can benefit from the simplicity and power of Piper.





Home, away and vacation security modes are created and 
monitored by simple to use rules. Record video, sound the siren or keep 
the system in stealth mode so you can quietly monitor the intruder.


Motion and sound detection - Piper will record a video and 
notify you if motion is detected or a loud sound occurs. It can even 
tell you when a smoke or fire alarm goes off.
Piper extends the performance of its security system by adding Z-Wave
 sensors or switches to security rules. Monitor doors and windows and 
turn lights on if an intruder enters your home.









Build your trusted circle of friends and family to share notifications when you are out of reach.


Piper adjusts its detection capabilities if you have a pet, ensuring 
that a real intruder is detected instead of just Arthur chasing his 
ball.








Smart home automation made easy
Piper is a hugely extendable home automation hub.




It works with hundreds of Z-Wave add-on accessories. By sensing your 
home's environment it can automatically turn on or off lights, heaters, 
and air conditioners or run them on a schedule.


Get notified when your kids get home from school, or when someone is 
calling your home phone. Piper will even warn you of an approaching 
storm when a window has been left open.



Eyes and ears of your homeFor eyes, Piper has a 180° fisheye camera. This unique HD camera has a
 180° field of view both horizontally and vertically. Use Piper’s 
electronic pan-tilt-zoom to see what’s happening in your home, wall to 
wall and floor to ceiling, in real time on your phone or tablet.
The camera offers three ways to view your space: Pan-tllt-zoom, Quad view, and Panorama.


While watching live video, interact with family, pets, or even unwanted guests at home with two way audio.




Interact with lighting controls directly from the camera view; adjust the mood of your home before you return.



Perks

All perks including a Piper have no monthly fees and free shipping to Canada and US!















Piper's design




Careful thought was put into designing an elegant product that will 
fit into your home's interior in a way that is discreet and appealing. 


Piper has a stunning, compact, two-toned form with brushed aluminum legs.
It can be mounted on your wall or placed on any surface at home - 
your desk, shelf, table, mantle place, window sill, counter, etc.
Piper’s base color is glossy white with grey accents. There is also a
 special all-black Piper edition which is one of the pledge levels.

How does Piper work?
Piper itself is an embedded Linux system running on an ARM processor.
 Since it uses Wi-Fi to connect with your home network, you are free to 
place it anywhere in your home to obtain the best possible video 
coverage. The Piper app connects directly back to Piper for most of its 
communication, whether you are on your home Wi-Fi, your work’s Wi-Fi or 
even a cellular connection.
Security and automation rules, settings and live video connections 
are all made directly to Piper itself, so your private data is not 
stored on our servers.This makes Piper smart since all rules are 
executed locally without reliance on your internet being active. That 
means that if you want the siren to go off when motion is detected, it 
will work regardless of internet connectivity.
The same is true for Z-Wave integration. Piper is a Z-Wave hub. Up to
 232 Z-Wave devices can be paired to Piper and rules can be based off of
 these external devices. Piper supports many of the mainstream Z-wave devices, and based on interest and support we will expand this list to include more esoteric devices as a stretch objective.
The cloud infrastructure provides Piper a place to store event 
videos, send various types of notifications and perform additional 
login/connection negotiation. When an event occurs, the video will be 
uploaded into our cloud system so that if something happens to Piper, 
you will still have access to it. Backups of your configuration are also
 stored in the cloud to allow easy migration to a new device, or 
restoring after a reset.



Encryption
Piper only communicates with the mobile app and the cloud over SSL. This means your video, audio, and security 
data are secure and encrypted at all times. Furthermore, user access is authenticated.



Our team



Blacksumac's partners
Celestica is one of the largest Electronics Contract Manufacturers in
 the world. Blacksumac's hardware design team has been working with 
Celestica since 2012, producing and testing Piper prototypes and limited
 production runs. Celestica will also be producing Piper's mass 
production run soon.
Gibson Product Design has won design awards for the last 7 years at 
the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Blacksumac and Gibson 
collaborated on Piper's enclosure design and manufacturing process.
Blacksumac is part of the Z-Wave alliance along with hundreds of 
companies who work together to make automation easy and accessible. 


Where are we in development?


Piper has been tested in users trials with prototypes since April 
2013. We have just completed manufacturing our first 100 boards in 
preparation for our beta test program.


We’ve entered into formal compliance testing, developed the hardware test suite, and designed the test mount.
Piper’s enclosure mould designs are finished and are being shipped 
from China in preparation for the full production run in Toronto. The 
long lead components for this run have already been ordered.
We’ve completed the main feature development on both iOS and Android 
mobile platforms, and are currently engaged in the bug fixing cycle.



Why we need your support


We have developed a visionary product that is ready to go into full production. To do so, we need your help.
Your support will allow us to move into full production and 
manufacturing so we can make Piper available to you and others who never
 imagined that it would be possible to combine so much usefulness into 
such a small and beautiful package.
We will also begin development of a cellular version of Piper. We 
have already provisioned for this in our hardware design, and your 
support will allow us to accelerate final development and beta testing 
of this next version.

PressDesignPersonalise your bottle by choosing your favourite colourWe have 5 different variations of the BU Water bottle to choose from; 4 coloured and 1 Natural. The Natural model has a leather strap and a black filter clip whilst the coloured variants have a rubber strap and a colour matched filter clip.Easy AccessA modern twist on the vintage quick release bottles; no screw tops, no straws...The world’s most sustainable water filterWe use a traditional Japanese method to transform the bamboo into activated charcoal; this is done by simply cutting the stalk to size and treating it in a specially designed kiln. Unlike the majority of water filters on the market ours doesn’t rely on unnatural resins to provide its final shape.Once you've finished using the filter it can be crushed and buried in your garden, releasing nutrients into the soil and helping plants grow.How it worksThe charcoaling process opens up millions of tiny pores within the bamboo's structure creating a huge surface area of activated charcoal with countless bonding sites. Chemicals from the water are then attracted to these sites where they become trapped. Bad odours and chemicals such as Chlorine are adsorbed by the filter whilst it simultaneously releases minerals such as potassium and magnesium back into the water creating a crisp and silky taste.Why Bamboo?Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on the planet growing up to 3 feet per day. This paired with its strong and durable properties is why it’s the core material used in our products at BU.
It's versatility has allowed us to make 2 of the bottle's components from bamboo capturing it's elegant and sustainable characteristics in our final design.

<p>
</p><p>Edi is the only existing domestic lamp that lights up your
home and garden wherever and
whenever you see fit. Edi’s unique innovation will transform your domestic
lighting into an uniquely flexible experience - that is entirely dependant on your mood. Edi’s portability allows you to move the lamp wherever you want inside your home, or anywhere in your garden. All you need to do then is; adjust the brightness, angle and height of the
lamp, flick the switch, and you have constructed a new space, a fresh perspective. There is no longer the constraints of wires and plugs preventing you
from creating any ambience, at any time.</p>

Edi is the only existing domestic lamp that lights up your
home and garden wherever and
whenever you see fit. Edi’s unique innovation will transform your domestic
lighting into an uniquely flexible experience - that is entirely dependant on your mood. Edi’s portability allows you to move the lamp wherever you want inside your home, or anywhere in your garden. All you need to do then is; adjust the brightness, angle and height of the
lamp, flick the switch, and you have constructed a new space, a fresh perspective. There is no longer the constraints of wires and plugs preventing you
from creating any ambience, at any time.
No wires. No worries.Edi

<h3><strong>Better Than Kerosene</strong></h3>
<p>Today across much of the world, lighting at night is powered by kerosene lanterns. Unfortunately, habitual use of kerosene is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes per day.

<p>At scale (e.g., once thousands of kits are produced), the <strong>TayaSola Lantern Kit</strong> will cost just US$5.00.

It is a small charity, so anything we donate will make a real difference.</p>
<p>Secondly, we'd like to buy memberships in our favourite museums and similar organisations. This lets us donate to good causes and enjoy some time together. We love the <a href=""http://www.rmanyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rubin Museum</a> in New York, <a href=""http://www.kew.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kew Gardens</a> near London, the <a href=""http://www.mercermuseum.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mercer Museum</a> near Philadelphia, the tiny <a href=""http://www.polperro.org/museum.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Polperro Heritage Museum of Smuggling And Fishing</a> and many others.</p>

  Why Ruggy?Ruggy allows you to hang more towels individually, and saves you lots of space. A towel rack bar ranges between 18-36 inches in length, while Ruggy is less than 1.5 inches wide.  
                                Only 5 wood species left to choose from! 
Towels retain moisture, allowing bacteria to breed. The main concept of Ruggy is the marble that holds the towel at a pin point. This technique allows the weight of the towel to hang free, while airing out the moisture captured in the towel. Ruggy allows more air to flow through the entire towel, causing the towel to dry faster than using a towel rack.

  Wood Species SelectionNatural wood is resilient, aesthetically pleasing, and comes with different colors. Below are 5 types of wood species to match your desire.  How it WorksRuggy is configured in a manner different from any wall hanger product. It has a marble that runs inside the hanger.   It's supported by a double-sided tape for fast and easy installation. When sliding in any type of fabric, the marble wedges the material against the tongue of the hanger, causing it to hang tight. To release, hold the fabric and pull gently to either side.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Growing up, I worked in my father’s Chinese
restaurants in New York before I joined the film industry as a grip in the
early 90s.  Typical of most small,
family-run restaurants, I was involved with all aspects of the business, from
delivery, prepping ingredients, cooking, to installation and repair of kitchen
equipment.  Drawing upon these
skills and experiences I started my own Chinese restaurant in California where
I was able share my favorite dishes with my customers. I then rejoined the film
industry. However, those customers continued to ask me to prepare their
favorite dishes and soon realized that the most important tool, an industrial
strength Wok Station, did not exist in the consumer market.  This is what inspired and motivated me
to create The WonderWok.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After several prototypes, I designed a revolutionary
portable cooking solution with The WonderWok that captures the design, high
heat, portability, versatility, and ease of use, all in one product.  There is no other product currently in
the marketplace like this.  It is
specifically designed for the home user and professional food service operator
that want an alternative to what is currently inadequate.  The cost of manufacturing to bring The
WonderWok to the market is costly (especially with the initial small
production) because of the high quality of materials and hand-assembled
parts.  This is very much like BBQ
grills where inferior models are substantially cheaper while the more solid ones
cost more.  This campaign is aimed
at raising the funds to produce the first batch of The WonderWok.</p>
<p>A common complaint of many of my YouTube followers
(also online competitor reviews of wok burners) is that conventional burners do
not produce sufficient heat that is vital to good wok cooking.  For the last few years, I have read the
comments and sympathized with my viewers that have been unable to successfully
replicate my recipes at home.  It
then, became a passion for me to develop a solid, high-end, but reasonably
priced Wok Station that will allow anyone to use my recipes to produce healthy
and delicious Chinese dishes and more.  </p><p>The production of the first batch of The WonderWok will fulfill my long
time wish to finally make this available to my viewers.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our Goal is $100,000. These funds will go directly
to the manufacturing of the parts that make up the WonderWok. This will cover
the first run of the WonderWok and start up costs.</p>
<p>If our goal is not met the funds raised will go to
manufacture a limited number of units.</p>
<p>This project will allow me to bring a much demanded
product to the market place for the home consumer and food service operators
who need the right equipment that will allow them to duplicate their own
healthy authentic Chinese foods and more.</p>

<h3>Hello Friends, Family, and Strangers with a Heart of Gold!</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>My name is Beth Dodson and I am raising funds to send my roommate home to Texas for Christmas!</p>
<p>Debbie is in her early 50s and currently works as an Administrative Assistant for a brand new Christian high school in Torrance, CA. She commutes an hour to work each day in Southern California traffic. Debbie also volunteers her time at her church with the Ladies Ministry, enjoys spending time with her kids, and watching The Voice on television.</p>
<p>She hasn't seen her parents for over a year and a half, and they're not getting any younger! Due to a particularly difficult financial year, Debbie is unable to afford a plane ticket and will otherwise be spending Christmas morning by herself in our apartment. </p>
<p>Well, not on my watch. I have been blessed with the opportunity to be able to go home for Christmas and I want that same blessing for Debbie, but I can only do it with a little help from my friends.</p>
<p>When I moved out to California to pursue my dream of writing for television and movies, I was a stranger in a strange land. (Seriously, it doesn't rain here. That's strange) My living situation was terrible. (Seriously, the house had no heat or air conditioning and I was living with five other people who had very different definitions of ""clean"") When I met Debbie, she needed to rent a room in her apartment for some extra income and it was a perfect fit for me. (Seriously, I get my own room and there are no bugs) I really believe that Debbie's willingness to open her home to me at a price I could afford greatly contributed to my ability to stay in California and pursue my dream.</p>
<p>With your support, I will be able to ""pay it forward"" and give someone an amazing Christmas present. And YOU can say you were a part of giving someone an amazing Christmas present: the gift of home. </p>

<p>We cannot wait to share our product with you. And we can only imagine how excited you will be when you receive Muzo. Of course, we keep our rational way of thinking, since we are convinced that the most important thing is to ensure timely delivery of Muzo to our backers.</p>
<p>Although we do have preliminary contracts with manufacturers, we still take huge alert of any uncontrollable accidents. If our project gets successfully funded, we are going to face the challenges related to production, packaging, and shipping worldwide.</p>
<p>However, we cannot foresee future problems in terms of production, packing, and shipping. We may encounter some technical problems, but we have already prepared an emergency solution which may cause the product to be slightly different. We believe we are strong enough to keep our promises to you since we have worked on production problems as the top priority. We held multiple negotiations with manufacturers long before entering the market. At the same time, logistics is thought out to the last detail for shipping out the rewards. This serves as the best evidence of how concerned we are about shipping your Muzo on time.</p>
<p>It is our duty to inform you about any accidents that might postpone the shipping of your order. In case this happens we will have to ask you to be patient until your Muzo arrives. We will fix the shipping problem as soon as we can. Moreover, we will keep exerting best efforts on improving our product, and, of course, you will stay informed every step of the way.</p>

Before starting mass production we will continue working on optimization and software. Surely, safety testing and certification application are ongoing as well.  
 

Our R&D team is comprised of talented and professional acoustics experts, engineers, and designers with enthusiasm for developing innovative products. As some might know, real-time algorithms and back-end software are one of the major challenges in this project. To overcome all of the encountered challenges our team spent nearly a year. No matter how far Muzo will go, it is the achievement of all of its members. Thank you all!
Want to get more information about our company and us? Please, see our company website.

Risks and challenges

We cannot wait to share our product with you. And we can only imagine how excited you will be when you receive Muzo. Of course, we keep our rational way of thinking, since we are convinced that the most important thing is to ensure timely delivery of Muzo to our backers.
Although we do have preliminary contracts with manufacturers, we still take huge alert of any uncontrollable accidents. If our project gets successfully funded, we are going to face the challenges related to production, packaging, and shipping worldwide.
However, we cannot foresee future problems in terms of production, packing, and shipping. We may encounter some technical problems, but we have already prepared an emergency solution which may cause the product to be slightly different. We believe we are strong enough to keep our promises to you since we have worked on production problems as the top priority. We held multiple negotiations with manufacturers long before entering the market. At the same time, logistics is thought out to the last detail for shipping out the rewards. This serves as the best evidence of how concerned we are about shipping your Muzo on time.
It is our duty to inform you about any accidents that might postpone the shipping of your order. In case this happens we will have to ask you to be patient until your Muzo arrives. We will fix the shipping problem as soon as we can. Moreover, we will keep exerting best efforts on improving our product, and, of course, you will stay informed every step of the way.
** Kickstarter and Indiegogo - Indemand campaigns are our official campaigns. If you know any third-party websites claiming that they can provide pre-orders for Muzo, please be careful with unauthorized online selling. We clarify that we have no connection/partnership with any other parties at this moment. If you have any doubts about Muzo, please feel free to contact us by info@celestialtribe.com.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div>
<p><b>1. How large is the range of INFi Marvel?</b></p>
<p>INFi transfers data and signal through power lines. Normally its transfer distance on power lines can be 300 meters in one circuit which is enough for common families to use.</p>
<p><b>2. Can INFi Marvel be used with powerline adapters?</b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><b>3. Do I still need a traditional modem if I use the INFi Marvel?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The INFi Marvel only builds up WLAN for your house, so you still have to use the Community Broadband or ADSL modem to have access to the Internet.</p>
<p><b>4. Can I just use one of the two parts alone?</b></p>
<p>The main router (ellipse) can be used as a wireless router independently, but the extender (round) must be used with the main router.</p>
<p><b>5. Will the INFi Marvel be interfered by other appliances in the house when it’s transferring data?</b></p>
<p>Most appliances in the house do not interfere the INFi Marvel’s performance, but chargers may make big interference. So you’d better avoid using INFi around chargers or AC adapters.</p>
<p><b>6. What if I forget the password to log in the administration page of INFi Marvel?( how to reset the router?)</b></p>
<p>You should reset the router to factory settings. There is a “reset” button at the bottom of the router; turn on the router, hold the reset button for 10 seconds, then release it. When the PLC light is off, the reset is done.</p>
<p><b>7. What influences the strength of WiFi signal?</b></p>
<p>WLAN transfer signals through microwave, and microwave’s diffraction is weak. The main barrier in the house is the walls. Walls not only block the signal but also absorb the energy of microwave, thus a device behind a wall can not receive the WiFi signal or only receives very weak signal.</p>
<p><b>8. What is the difference between the common PLC modems and the INFi Marvel?</b></p>
<p>Normal PLC modems only function as a substitution of the network cable, but INFi Marvel not only functions as a PLC modem but also as WLAN and a router.</p>
<p><b>9. Does this router and the extender need to be paired? Is it plug-and-play?</b></p>
<p>The INFi Marvel’s main router and extender are paired before leaving the factory, so you don’t have to get them paired. But if you have bought extra extenders, you have to pair the extra extenders to the main router.</p>
<p><b>10. How strong is the signal of INFi Marvel? Is its radiation high?</b></p>
<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> generation of communication technology (Powerline Communication) is applied in INFi Marvel; PLC helps the WiFi signal to travel through walls, which reduces the power consumption to the minimum. Besides, there’s no high-power antenna placed on INFi Marvel, which produces much lower radiation than traditional routers. INFi Marvel is an eco-friendly router with low radiation, especially suitable for being used in places like living rooms or study rooms.</p>

2. Can INFi Marvel be used with powerline adapters?
Yes.
3. Do I still need a traditional modem if I use the INFi Marvel?
Yes. The INFi Marvel only builds up WLAN for your house, so you still have to use the Community Broadband or ADSL modem to have access to the Internet.
4. Can I just use one of the two parts alone?
The main router (ellipse) can be used as a wireless router independently, but the extender (round) must be used with the main router.
5. Will the INFi Marvel be interfered by other appliances in the house when it’s transferring data?
Most appliances in the house do not interfere the INFi Marvel’s performance, but chargers may make big interference. So you’d better avoid using INFi around chargers or AC adapters.
6. What if I forget the password to log in the administration page of INFi Marvel?( how to reset the router?)
You should reset the router to factory settings. There is a “reset” button at the bottom of the router; turn on the router, hold the reset button for 10 seconds, then release it. When the PLC light is off, the reset is done.
7. What influences the strength of WiFi signal?
WLAN transfer signals through microwave, and microwave’s diffraction is weak. The main barrier in the house is the walls. Walls not only block the signal but also absorb the energy of microwave, thus a device behind a wall can not receive the WiFi signal or only receives very weak signal.
8. What is the difference between the common PLC modems and the INFi Marvel?
Normal PLC modems only function as a substitution of the network cable, but INFi Marvel not only functions as a PLC modem but also as WLAN and a router.
9. Does this router and the extender need to be paired? Is it plug-and-play?
The INFi Marvel’s main router and extender are paired before leaving the factory, so you don’t have to get them paired. But if you have bought extra extenders, you have to pair the extra extenders to the main router.
10. How strong is the signal of INFi Marvel? Is its radiation high?
The 3rd generation of communication technology (Powerline Communication) is applied in INFi Marvel; PLC helps the WiFi signal to travel through walls, which reduces the power consumption to the minimum. Besides, there’s no high-power antenna placed on INFi Marvel, which produces much lower radiation than traditional routers. INFi Marvel is an eco-friendly router with low radiation, especially suitable for being used in places like living rooms or study rooms.",22.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>Electric Assist Bicycles are one of the fastest growing
segments in the bicycle industry. These helpful technologies are empowering
people with an enhanced riding experience, with the ability to climb hills
with ease, ride with faster family and friends, and zip along, enjoying twice the
speed, while only using half the pedaling effort. Our E-bikes help more and more
people ride bikes again, commute to work, and utilize one of the most sustainable
forms of local transportation in the world. We are RunAbout Cycles, Josh Kerson and Elana Hurwitz and we have been hand-crafting some of the world’s most efficient
light electric vehicles for over eight years now. We are at a pivotal point, where we are ready for our next steps to manufacturing our electric bikes, in quantity, in a US factory.</p>
<p>RunAbout Cycles is going to launch from building handmade custom bikes, to ramping up our production with manufacturing of our bike frames and components in a North American factory. Our new factory produced models of our electric recumbent tricycles and electric mountain-touring bikes
that will enable us to price them at affordable rates for many more people to
enjoy. We invite you to support our fundraising efforts to be part of this
new development.</p>
<p>With our assistive technology designs, we have changed the lives of our riders. We have witnessed people gaining independence, building confidence, and
becoming stronger, healthier and happier. Our E-bikes give the rider the ability to choose the level of assist (motor) to combine with their pedaling, or to use the motor alone, depending upon their physical needs, riding style, terrain and load. We have also been able to custom design for each rider's specific physical needs with adaptive fittings. Understanding the heartfelt appreciation we have from our clients and early adopters, we aspire to bring the vehicles we design to many more riders in the world. ""<b>The RunAbout Smile</b>"" is something everyone has experienced, after a great test ride on our Spincycle Electric Trike. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>RunAbout Cycles has been developing our light electric
vehicle designs for over eight years. We have handcrafted our SpinCycle, an electric
human-hybrid-tricycle, and built custom electric bicycle conversions for a
total of over a hundred satisfied customers. We’ve even built twelve prototypes,
and the final vehicle for a new start-up electric bicycle company in Tennessee
in 2008. Now we are ready, as leaders in the testing and use of the latest
components like batteries and motors; with well tested and proven, zero
emissions vehicles of our own design.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>We have a special opportunity to work with an established North American
manufacturer who would like to produce our frames. We also have
had consistent interest and requests for our products to be put into a distribution
network of over twenty stores throughout the New England area, as well as electric
bicycle stores across the country. Additionally, we are fortunate to
have interest in our product from customers here in America and around the
globe, including the Netherlands, Germany and Australia. </p>
<p>We believe our electric-human-hybrid vehicles are a step into the future of sustainable local transportation. Our vehicles are part of the most sustainable transportation solutions that the world is calling for. They have also been purpose built from the ground up, well tested, refined, and developed over the last ten years.</p>
<p>With the use of advanced lithium ion batteries, brushless DC motors, and smart
controllers, we have been on the cutting edge of technologies that will help change the world. The
efficiencies may be hard to comprehend, but are in the area of 2,000 miles to the
gallon equivalency. That is, for around 4 dollars worth of electricity, and
recharging your E bike at 5 cents, per 25 miles, you can recharge and go 2,000
miles, for the same amount of energy that it costs for a gallon of gasoline!  And, the more you are able to add in your pedal-power, the more efficient your ride.<br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><h2><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>With A Factory Production Run of Our Trike and Bike Frames We will Offer</b></p>

Colorado, USA at about 12,000 feet elevation, during “Ride The Rockies 2012.” (see ride map below) Riding
our RunAbout Electric Mountain Touring Bicycle up and over five mountains, along hundreds of miles of Colorado roads, during a
total of six days, finally winding back to our home in Fort Collins Colorado. For
Josh, it was the best ride of his life, he was empowered to pass hundreds of road
riders per hour, as he tested the abilities of our new design. As a cyclist  for over thirty years, this was the pinnacle of his riding experience. Josh was
absolutely convinced that we have an award winning design ready for factory

Electric Assist Bicycles are one of the fastest growing
segments in the bicycle industry. These helpful technologies are empowering
people with an enhanced riding experience, with the ability to climb hills
with ease, ride with faster family and friends, and zip along, enjoying twice the
speed, while only using half the pedaling effort. Our E-bikes help more and more
people ride bikes again, commute to work, and utilize one of the most sustainable
forms of local transportation in the world. We are RunAbout Cycles, Josh Kerson and Elana Hurwitz and we have been hand-crafting some of the world’s most efficient
light electric vehicles for over eight years now. We are at a pivotal point, where we are ready for our next steps to manufacturing our electric bikes, in quantity, in a US factory.
RunAbout Cycles is going to launch from building handmade custom bikes, to ramping up our production with manufacturing of our bike frames and components in a North American factory. Our new factory produced models of our electric recumbent tricycles and electric mountain-touring bikes
that will enable us to price them at affordable rates for many more people to
enjoy. We invite you to support our fundraising efforts to be part of this
new development.
With our assistive technology designs, we have changed the lives of our riders. We have witnessed people gaining independence, building confidence, and
becoming stronger, healthier and happier. Our E-bikes give the rider the ability to choose the level of assist (motor) to combine with their pedaling, or to use the motor alone, depending upon their physical needs, riding style, terrain and load. We have also been able to custom design for each rider's specific physical needs with adaptive fittings. Understanding the heartfelt appreciation we have from our clients and early adopters, we aspire to bring the vehicles we design to many more riders in the world. ""The RunAbout Smile"" is something everyone has experienced, after a great test ride on our Spincycle Electric Trike. 


RunAbout Cycles has been developing our light electric
vehicle designs for over eight years. We have handcrafted our SpinCycle, an electric
human-hybrid-tricycle, and built custom electric bicycle conversions for a
total of over a hundred satisfied customers. We’ve even built twelve prototypes,
and the final vehicle for a new start-up electric bicycle company in Tennessee
in 2008. Now we are ready, as leaders in the testing and use of the latest
components like batteries and motors; with well tested and proven, zero
emissions vehicles of our own design.
Photo: Josh Kerson at work.Opportunity Knocking:
We have a special opportunity to work with an established North American
manufacturer who would like to produce our frames. We also have
had consistent interest and requests for our products to be put into a distribution
network of over twenty stores throughout the New England area, as well as electric
bicycle stores across the country. Additionally, we are fortunate to
have interest in our product from customers here in America and around the
globe, including the Netherlands, Germany and Australia. 
We believe our electric-human-hybrid vehicles are a step into the future of sustainable local transportation. Our vehicles are part of the most sustainable transportation solutions that the world is calling for. They have also been purpose built from the ground up, well tested, refined, and developed over the last ten years.
With the use of advanced lithium ion batteries, brushless DC motors, and smart
controllers, we have been on the cutting edge of technologies that will help change the world. The
efficiencies may be hard to comprehend, but are in the area of 2,000 miles to the
gallon equivalency. That is, for around 4 dollars worth of electricity, and
recharging your E bike at 5 cents, per 25 miles, you can recharge and go 2,000
miles, for the same amount of energy that it costs for a gallon of gasoline!  And, the more you are able to add in your pedal-power, the more efficient your ride.With A Factory Production Run of Our Trike and Bike Frames We will Offer
Two of Our Signature Electric Bikes:

RunAbout Cycles 2014 SpinCycle (TM) Electric-Human-Hybrid TricycleThe SpinCycle is our signature recumbent tricycle. It is a tadpole trike, with two
wheels up front for the most stable riding platform in the industry. The SpinCycle electric assist tricycles are designed and engineered to be the most stable,
comfortable, and utilitarian vehicles ever offered. 
You can ride the SpinCycle at up to 20 MPH (32 K) on motor alone. Add in your pedaling for an efficient use of the battery charge, giving you a longer range ride, before you need to re-charge the battery. Our E-trikes are equipped with disc brakes for complete, sure stopping power. Our SpinCycle tricycle has a comfortable seating position that supports your back, giving you leverage to push on the pedals, and at the same time the height of the rider is at the equivalent to a small sports car, so you have the visibility and seeing ability when riding along bike lanes in urban settings. Our riders find it great for transportation, and carrying a load.  
Our E-trikes come with the most advanced lithium ion
batteries, smart chargers, fuel meters and brushless hub motors available in
the industry today. All SpinCycles include independent front suspension and independent front disc brakes. With safety in mind, we include tail-light ""blinkies"" and tires with reflective strips. Our aircraft quality 4130 Chromoly steel frames are the
lightest, strongest and most durable frames in the industry, and come with our
lifetime guarantee. The Trike frame can carry 350 lbs (158.75 KL) including the rider and has an integrated rack and pannier attachment rails built into the frame. Our E-bikes utilize ninety percent traditional bicycle components that can be found in bike shops
across the country and the world, making for ease of use, and maintenance. You're Invited: Reserve one of our first factory production built SpinCycle frames today, and become part of the electric revolution sweeping the world. You will be making a positive change in reducing our carbon footprint, changing our ""fuelish""
ways, one E bike at a time.

RunAbout Cycles 2014 Electric Mountain Touring Bike
Meet our Electric Mountain Touring Bike. This two-wheeled
machine has been designed and engineered as an electric human hybrid, from the
start, providing for one of the most well balanced electric mountain bikes in
the world. It is equipped with the most advanced brushless motor, and helical
gear reduction available today. This feeds the power directly through the
bicycle drive-train, empowering the rider to be two to three times stronger, on
demand. Because of our electric assist specific design, the rider’s experience
is smooth, strong and exciting. Our most interesting results, come from
studying the efficiencies involved, with again, over 2,000 miles to the E gallon
equivalency. 
Using 90% bicycle parts, that are available around the
world, enables our riders to access replacement parts from traditional bike
stores. With 100% recyclable Lithium ion batteries, our extra energy can be
stored in the lightest, safest batteries available today. As advancements in
Nanotech batteries come forward, our E cyclists will be able to upgrade into
better and better equipment, prolonging the value received from our designs.
Ideally, Our riders will invest into solar charging, and help to advance these
technologies into the cleanest form of transportation known. 





The photo above was taken on top of Independence Pass, in
Colorado, USA at about 12,000 feet elevation, during “Ride The Rockies 2012.” (see ride map below) Riding
our RunAbout Electric Mountain Touring Bicycle up and over five mountains, along hundreds of miles of Colorado roads, during a
total of six days, finally winding back to our home in Fort Collins Colorado. For
Josh, it was the best ride of his life, he was empowered to pass hundreds of road
riders per hour, as he tested the abilities of our new design. As a cyclist  for over thirty years, this was the pinnacle of his riding experience. Josh was
absolutely convinced that we have an award winning design ready for factory
production.

From Hand Made To Factory Made:We have known our manufacturer for over ten years, and have developed
a strong working relationship that will be beneficial to producing our frames in their factory. Utilizing the latest in robotic welding, CNC machining, tubing bending and
such, they are able to reproduce our bicycle frame designs to our exact specifications. Additionally
with their in-house powder coating painting system, we will maximize the manufacturing
efficiencies from cutting and bending tubes, to painting and packaging bicycle frames that will then be shipped directly to
our assembly facility. Final assembly of our e-bikes will still be done by hand, as well as installing the bicycle components and finishing the final electrical systems.
Note: Specifications may change with the availability of 2014 components. 
With Additional Funds we aspire to be able to buy our
components in bulk, directly from the manufacturers, helping to reduce the final cost for our customers around the world. Our experience in the past, attending bicycle manufacturing trade shows, has given us a head start in the work involved in establishing the connections for sourcing all of the vital parts necessary for our final production. We would also like to hire and train talent to help our process of the final assembly of our E-bikes. With a larger space for assembly and warehouse, we will also be enabled to complete testing, inspection and quality control, of our electric bicycles, as well as further development and design.

</div><div> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q: Does the Vapor Sphere create a smoke cloud like a
Vapor cigarette?</b> <br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: No, the vapors created in the
Vapor Sphere are invisible and do not create a smoke cloud of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q: Can I use Beer or Wine with the Vapor Sphere?</b><br/>A: Beer and Wine will not work with the Vapor Sphere. The Vapor Sphere was designed to only be used with Alcoholic Spirits that is sold to be consumed by drinking and has an Alcohol content that is 70-100 proof. Gin, Scotch, Whisky, Vodka, Bourbon Whiskey, Tequila and other type of Alcohol Spirits work great with the Vapor Sphere. The Alcohol content in Beer and Wine is to low and will not give you the buzz that you get from drinking it.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>Q: Can the Alcohol in your blood steam be detected and
measured by a breathalyzer after you vaporize Alcohol instead of drinking the
Alcohol?</b><br/>
<span>A: Yes, the Alcohol you vaporize is detectable and measured by a breathalyzer because
the Alcohol is in your blood steam. The Alcohol enters your blood by way of
your lungs instead of entering by way of your digestive tract.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: How does Vaporizing Alcohol get you buzzed?</b><br/>A: The chemical in Alcohol that gets you buzzed is called Ethanol. The heat from the candle releases the Ethanol vapors into the Sphere. When you inhale the vapors into your Lungs, the Ethanol gets into your blood stream without delay.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: How long will a shot of Alcohol last when vaporizing the
Alcohol with the Vapor Sphere?</b><br/>
<span>A: A shot of Alcohol will release the Ethanol Vapors (the chemical
in Alcohol that gets you drunk) for about 40 minutes allowing you to maintain a
comfortable Alcohol buzz the entire time the vapors are being released. After
40 minutes you will need to change out the old shot with a new shot.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Q: Is vaporizing Alcohol healthier than drinking Alcohol?</b><br/>A: I don’t want to mislead you into believing that vaporizing Alcohol instead of drinking Alcohol, somehow makes Alcohol healthy for you to consume. Alcohol is a potentially dangerous addictive drug, especially if used in
excess. Alcohol has never been considered healthy or good for you, and I am
sure it never will. Just because you don’t suffer from a hangover and it leaves your
system faster than drinking Alcohol, vaporizing Alcohol doesn’t magically make Alcohol
good for you. To my knowledge there has never been any long term studies that provide any
proof that vaporizing Alcohol instead of drinking alcohol is better or worse for you. As consumers we need to assume that vaporizing Alcohol
can have serious long term effects on our bodies, just like drinking Alcohol
does. So as with any Alcohol intake, enjoy Alcohol in moderation and be
responsible.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>Q: Why does the Alcohol leave your system fast when
vaporizing Alcohol?</b><br/>
<span>A:
Because the Alcohol does not metabolize in your digestive tract like drinking
Alcohol does, and it gets into your system fast. For this same reason it leaves
your system fast. When you are no longer vaporizing the Alcohol, it's not being
introduced to you system any more. On average any measurable amount of Alcohol
will be out of system with 15-30 minutes after your last vapor hit. All of the blood in your body passes through your Liver every 3 minutes. We can assume that after a few passes through your Liver, the Alcohol has been filtered out of your blood stream. That is as long as you are not introducing more Alcohol into your system.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Q: Can you taste the flavor of the Alcohol when you vaporize it?</b><br/>A: Yes, you can taste the flavor of the Alcohol when you vaporize it. As a matter of fact the flavor of the Alcohol is much smoother and easier to enjoy when vaporized. There is no harsh taste like when you drink the Alcohol. For the best flavor use high quality great tasting Alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>Q: Why don't you get a hangover when you vaporize Alcohol?</b><br/>
<span>A: The
reason we get a hangover after drinking Alcoholic Beverages, is due to the fact that our body has to
deal with the impurities (Congeners) that are produced during the distillation
process when making Alcoholic beverages. Our body will try to get rid of the
impurities through urination and drawing minerals from your body to help in the
fight against these impurities. This will leave you dehydrated causing you to
have headaches and other symptoms related to a handover. When you inhale
Alcohol vapors instead of drinking the Alcohol, you don't ingest these
impurities so your body doesn't have to deal with trying to get the impurities out of your
system.</span></p>
<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<p><b>Q: Why are there no Calories related to vaporizing Alcohol?</b><br/>
<span>A: Protein, Fat, and Carbohydrates are the only source of calories in food and beverages.
Apparently there is no Protein, Fat, or Carbohydrates in the vapors created
from vaporizing Alcohol. If there is any calories in vaporized Alcohol, the
calories are so few it's very difficult to measure them.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Q: I have seen videos of people on YouTube vaporizing Alcohol with a
bicycle pump and an empty two liter Soda Bottle. Does this method work like the
Vapor Sphere?</b><br/>
<span>A: There are two ways to vaporize Alcohol. You can used
compressed air like a bike pump to release the Vapors, or use a candle or heat
source to release the vapors. The only effective way to release the Ethanol Vapors from the Alcohol is to use a heat source
like a candle to release the vapors from the Alcoholic Spirits. This is
what the Vapor Sphere was designed to do. When you use compressed air (bicycle
pump) to release the vapors, it is not a very effective way to release the
Ethanol Vapors, and most people get disappointed with the results. Not to
mention it's a lot of work just to get one or two hits of Alcohol Vapors.</span></p>
<span></span><p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>Q: Some people posted on the internet that vaporizing Alcohol
doesn’t get you drunk. Is that true?<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A: If not done correctly, vaporizing Alcohol will not give
you the desired effect you’re looking for. We tested the Vapor Sphere with
product testers and focus groups so they could test the Vapor Sphere before
bringing it to the consumer market. We found that most people who don't know
how to vaporize Alcohol, inhale the vapors into their Stomach and not their
Lungs. Most people make the same mistake the first couple of times they try
vaporizing Alcohol. When we drink through a straw, our natural instinct is
to inhale the liquid into our stomach and not our Lungs. This makes total sense
when drinking. Once you understand that you need to inhale the vapors into your
Lungs and not your stomach, you will have no problems getting the effect you’re
looking for. I would be willing to bet that the people who posted on the
internet that vaporizing Alcohol doesn't get you drunk, were doing it wrong. If
you’re looking to get ""DRUNK"" as in too wasted to care for yourself,
then vaping Alcohol is not for you. Vaporizing Alcohol will allow you to get a
comfortable Alcohol buzz, but will not allow you to get wasted because the
Alcohol leaves your system fast. We had focus group participants check their
blood alcohol content with a breathalyzer after using the Vapor Sphere. We found
that the average BAC count was .12, and that's one in a half times the legal
limit for a DUI in most States. All the focus group participants described
their Vapor Sphere buzz as a comfortable or nice Alcohol buzz. See the above
video titled ""What's It Like to Vaporize Alcohol"".</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Will using the Vapor Sphere to vaporize Alcohol instead of
drinking it make me more likely to suffer from Alcohol Poisoning?</b><br/>
A: Customer safety was a top priority to us when considering bringing the
Vapor Sphere to the consumer market. We put the Vapor Sphere to the test with
product testers and focus group participants to see if we could get these peoples
Blood Alcohol Content to an unsafe level. We tested people of different ages,
weight, height, and ethnic backgrounds. We put breathalyzers in their hands and
challenged these participants to get there Blood Alcohol Content as high as
possible by using the Vapor Sphere. No body tested was able to get there BAC any
were close to an unsafe level, no matter how hard they tried. The highest BAC
recorded during these test was .25 and within 30 minutes of the test, his BAC
dropped to .00. We have found that if you have a functioning normal healthy
liver, you will not be able to get your Blood Alcohol Content to an unsafe
level using the Vapor Sphere. If you drink Alcohol to excess and then use the
Vapor Sphere to get your BAC higher than of course you could suffer from
Alcohol Poisoning. We are confident that if you were to use just the Vapor
Sphere in the manner it was designed and not drink Alcohol with it, you will not have to worry about your BAC
getting too high. DON’T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT, TRY IT FOR YOURSELF. Buy a
breathalyzer and test yourself to see if you can get your BAC to an unsafe
level using the Vapor Sphere the way it was designed to be used. We are
confident that you will get the same results we did during our testing process.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","We created the Vapor Sphere, because there was nothing on the market that allowed you to vaporize Alcohol that was affordable and easy to use. The simple yet elegant design of the Vapor Sphere allows you to vaporize your favorite Hard Liquor, in just about any social situation where people get  together to enjoy a drink. 

The goal we had in mind when creating the Vapor Sphere was to be able to take the drink out of your hand, and replace it with an easy to use Alcohol Vaporizer that looks and feels like you're still holding and enjoying a regular drink. 







The Vapor Sphere allows you to enjoy your favorite Hard Liquor without the Impurities, the Calories, or High Blood Sugar Spikes for Diabetics that normally come with drinking Alcohol. As an added bonus, when vaporizing Alcohol with the Vapor Sphere, the Alcohol leaves most people’s system within 15 to 30 minutes after you inhale your last vapor hit of Alcohol. This makes it safe to drive much faster than when you drink Alcohol. With the Vapor Sphere there’s no Hangover the next day. You wake up fresh and ready to face the day ahead of you.




   


We put the Vapor Sphere in the hands of people who didn't know that you could Vaporize Alcohol instead of drinking it. We showed this focus group how to use the Vapor Sphere and asked them for their honest opinions and feedback about this product so we could make improvements before bringing it to the consumer market. Watch the video above to see what the focus group participants said about the Vapor Sphere after their first experience Vaporizing Alcohol.









  
    This video shows you what comes with the Vapor Sphere. The Vapor Sphere comes with everything needed to get started vaporizing any hard Alcohol that is sold for drinking. All you will need is something to light the candle with (Lighter/Matches), and your favorite hard Liquor that is 70-100 proof. Watch the above video to see what is included with the Vapor Sphere Kit.







Because of the special and unique heat resistant glass used to make the Vapor Sphere, you can hold the Vapor Sphere in your hand without feeling the heat from the candle that is used to vaporize the Alcohol. We have set very high standards for the glass manufacturer that we chose to use too make this product. Each Vapor Sphere is made by hand and decorated by skilled glass blowers. Watch the video above that shows how each Vapor Sphere is made. This Video Is Sped Up To 4 x The Actual Speed.













We have done everything needed to bring the Vapor Sphere to the consumer market. We tested the Vapor Sphere for over one year by putting this product into the hands of product testers and focus groups. We now feel confident about bringing this high quality, easy to use product to the consumer market.
What we need now are the funds for Marketing, and to buy the highest quality materials needed to make the Vapor Sphere at a volume discount. This is what your campaign contributions will go towards.

<p>Riven and Mimsy have been together for over ten years now, starting their relationship in Highschool and taking the first step towards marriage on October 3rd 2011 by getting their Domestic Partnership. Now that same-sex marriage is legal in their state, they want to get married for real.</p>
<p>But wait... Where's the pony?</p>
<p>This isn't just any wedding! This is a full on My Little Pony, Lyra and Bon Bon, themed wedding, with Princess Cadance officiating and featuring the musical stylings of many Brony musicians who were featured at Ponystock EFNW'13. In fact, given the number of people involved with EverfreeNW that we have involved in this project, it can almost be counted as an extension of the Elements of Melody: Music of Everfree concert series, a sneak peek into some of the acts you'll see at EOM:MOE'13. Costumes and cosplay are incouraged but not reuired, and since the event is in October we decided to open the costume options up to whatever fandom or style you want. Riven and Mimsy will be attending as Lyra and BonBon, but everyone else can pick whtever they want to be from MLP, Doctor Who, Anime, Games, Steampunk, etc. Anything you want to wear, whoever you want to be, all are welcome!</p>

It is designed for any home, and even your boat and RV!We found that over 50% of tumble dryer users were not satisfied with the drying performance such as dryness and drying time, while more than 40% complained about high energy consumption.Standard home tumble dryers just take too long to dry even the smallest of wash loads. They take up too much home space and can rack up a fortune in energy bills and even damage fabrics, but with Morus Zero, all of those are a thing of the past.Dry as well as freshThe built-in UV sterilization effectively eliminates 99.9% of bacteria during the ultrafast drying time. It’s also environmentally friendly since there are no dangerous or toxic chemicals to handle. So not only does Morus Zero keep your clothes dry, but also keeps them clean from any nasty bacteria!Drying clothes just got smarterThe moisture sensor system automatically turns off the device when Morus Zero can no longer detect moisture within the clothes and the drying is finished. Just press “Start”, sit back, relax and let Morus Zero do the rest. It’s that simple.Say goodbye to wrinklesUnlike the single-motor design of other conventional dryers, Morus Zero has three high-performance motors inside, one of which is used to drive the drum to rotate independently. Our program can precisely control the direction, speed and even acceleration of the tumble. In this way the clothes can be dried evenly and come out with fewer wrinkles.Plug in and go The compact design of the Morus Zero makes it an ideal choice for small living spaces, like starter homes, cramped city apartments and even RVs. Basically, you can place it anywhere. It is convenient to install, and there is no ventilation needed, making it easy to get started with the Morus Zero right away. More emojis are on their way ^_< Easily select the drying mode you like.

<p>Our deluxe, fully-featured soother is customizable to suit any family's sleep routine with the Smart Connect™<strong> </strong>app.  You can use the app to create a “Sleep Stages” plan, which is a tool to help enhance  your baby’s bedtime routine. Our child development experts at the Fisher-Price Play Lab helped us create this three-step approach to help get your little one down for the night:<br/><br/><strong><u>STAGE 1</u></strong> – <strong>Captivate</strong> – You know that feeling when your baby isn’t quite ready to settle down.  In this stage,  the soother’s enchanting lights &amp; gentle music help grab your little ones’ attention.</p>
<p><strong><u>STAGE 2</u></strong> – <strong>Soothe</strong> – Dimmed lights and softer, slower music help your baby relax.</p>
<p><u><b>STAGE 3</b></u> – <strong>Sleep</strong> – Projection is replaced with a gentle night light and calming sounds to help your little one sleep.</p>

<p><strong>What is the benefit of pink noise?  </strong></p>
<p><strong>White noise</strong> is a combination of all frequencies across our hearing spectrum at the same volume, so it can be quite harsh. <strong>Pink noise</strong> is similar, but has a less volume in the higher frequencies.  So it is less fatiguing - especially for long durations.</p>

<p>We are working with Indiegogo to get to the heart of what our consumers – and potential consumers – really need from us. <strong>What products will make your life easier?</strong> What do you expect from us? More than crowdfunding, this campaign is about <strong>crowdsourcing ideas</strong> and opinions that will help us understand what kinds of products our consumers will really get behind and support.</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign is<strong> not about the money.</strong> It’s about getting in touch with what our consumers really want and need. It’s about providing <strong>amazing experiences for families</strong>. As a big company, it can be challenging to really get in touch with a wide range of consumers on a <strong>meaningful level</strong>, and Indiegogo is helping us do just that.</p>

</div></div>","This is the easiest bedtime routine for your baby.  Soothing sounds and gentle projections perfectly captivate your child's attention, soothe to calm, and keep them asleep all night long.

 


Our deluxe, fully-featured soother is customizable to suit any family's sleep routine with the Smart Connect™ app.  You can use the app to create a “Sleep Stages” plan, which is a tool to help enhance  your baby’s bedtime routine. Our child development experts at the Fisher-Price Play Lab helped us create this three-step approach to help get your little one down for the night:STAGE 1 – Captivate – You know that feeling when your baby isn’t quite ready to settle down.  In this stage,  the soother’s enchanting lights & gentle music help grab your little ones’ attention.
STAGE 2 – Soothe – Dimmed lights and softer, slower music help your baby relax.
STAGE 3 – Sleep – Projection is replaced with a gentle night light and calming sounds to help your little one sleep.

This soother gives you and your baby tons of customizable combinations:


 


 


 


What is the benefit of pink noise?  
White noise is a combination of all frequencies across our hearing spectrum at the same volume, so it can be quite harsh. Pink noise is similar, but has a less volume in the higher frequencies.  So it is less fatiguing - especially for long durations.

""The soother has been billed as the latest product from the pre-school specialist to feature Fisher-Price Smart Connect technology, meaning parents can control their collection of baby products through smartphones and tablets."" - Toy News

<p>We all love to travel and our goal is to run out of pages in our passports. Our story began from one night flight, when we were approaching our destination’s airport for landing. We was captivated by the mesmerizing view of the city skyline with golden lights peppering the city. The warm, ambient glow emanated from buildings, roads, and streetlights, all forming the modern-day city we know so well. </p>
<p>That’s how the Nitelanding Lamp™ came to be. We created this lamp so that we could pause time and stay in that moment forever. We'd love to share this with the rest of the world, so that they can revisit the happiest memories of their trip with family, friends and love ones.</p>

<h3><strong>CITY by DAY: THE ART OF CITY STREET in 3 Dimensional</strong></h3>
<p>""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"" The style and design of the Nitelanding Lamp carries a minimal clean look, yet accompanied with a touch of modern. </p>
<p>Each artwork of the city map is crafted with precise clean cut and contours with micro details (some lines as thin as 0.6 mm). We remain all the actual map accuracy (OpenStreetMap data), and restyle the streets, roads and rivers in the form of 3D ART. Our Satin-White finishing of the city street layer resemble a minimal purity of white canvas painting. Each city map is accompanied by the city’s name with its respective time zone (UTC).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568829585/nco3om9ncg3vglobbwnj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A close up look of Satin-White city street details, created the look of white canvas painting in 3D ART.</p>
<h3><strong>CITY by NIGHT: GLOWING STREET LIGHT</strong></h3>
<p>We created the ""Glowing Street Light Effect"" (patent pending) to simulate the city night view. By implementing lighting depth illusion on the transparent plexiglass layer (underneath the city street map) to replicate more than a thousand illuminated lighting effect of buildings and street lights.  </p>
<p>The basic theory is when the light travels into the edge of a clear polymer or glass, the light will bounce around inside until it finds a way out at the far edges with the effect of no light being lost (similar to the basis of fiber optics). But an interesting twist happens when the surface between the edges is disrupted. By etching and carving pattern on each surface of the material one by one, we control where the light escapes and create the effect of more than thousand street lamps. </p>

<p>LEDs are cool to touch because they generally don't produce heat in the form of IR. We designed the ""Glowing Street Light Effect"" by having the LEDs conceal along the side of the frame, a similar technique to the edge-light system for light guide panel (ELS-LGP).</p>
<p>With the city street layer placed on top, the heat is placed further from light source making the lamp surface low in heat and safe to touch even for playing.</p>

</div></div>","Bring home the fabulous CITY LIGHT view!

NITELANDING™ is an evocative lamp, crafted to bring back the moment of looking down at a bustling metropolis city view from your window airplane seat at 30,000 ft in the air. 
Nitelanding lamp is a sophisticated 2-in-1 decorative ART display, featuring famous city maps from around the world. During the day, it gives the visual impression of a detailed 3D city map. At night, the lamp comes to life, illuminating a fabulous city light view.

 NITELANDING LAMP™ story

We all love to travel and our goal is to run out of pages in our passports. Our story began from one night flight, when we were approaching our destination’s airport for landing. We was captivated by the mesmerizing view of the city skyline with golden lights peppering the city. The warm, ambient glow emanated from buildings, roads, and streetlights, all forming the modern-day city we know so well. 
That’s how the Nitelanding Lamp™ came to be. We created this lamp so that we could pause time and stay in that moment forever. We'd love to share this with the rest of the world, so that they can revisit the happiest memories of their trip with family, friends and love ones.
What is so Unique about NITELANDING LAMP ? 

NITELANDING Lamp is the world's first lamp that let you experience the hybrid nature of showcasing it’s ART in 2 different versions. Giving you the best of both world! Where you able to transform instantaneously to your liking.

Even our friend doze off to the comforts of the ambient surroundings!
CITY by DAY: THE ART OF CITY STREET in 3 Dimensional
""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"" The style and design of the Nitelanding Lamp carries a minimal clean look, yet accompanied with a touch of modern. 
Each artwork of the city map is crafted with precise clean cut and contours with micro details (some lines as thin as 0.6 mm). We remain all the actual map accuracy (OpenStreetMap data), and restyle the streets, roads and rivers in the form of 3D ART. Our Satin-White finishing of the city street layer resemble a minimal purity of white canvas painting. Each city map is accompanied by the city’s name with its respective time zone (UTC).

A close up look of Satin-White city street details, created the look of white canvas painting in 3D ART.
CITY by NIGHT: GLOWING STREET LIGHT
We created the ""Glowing Street Light Effect"" (patent pending) to simulate the city night view. By implementing lighting depth illusion on the transparent plexiglass layer (underneath the city street map) to replicate more than a thousand illuminated lighting effect of buildings and street lights.  
The basic theory is when the light travels into the edge of a clear polymer or glass, the light will bounce around inside until it finds a way out at the far edges with the effect of no light being lost (similar to the basis of fiber optics). But an interesting twist happens when the surface between the edges is disrupted. By etching and carving pattern on each surface of the material one by one, we control where the light escapes and create the effect of more than thousand street lamps.

LOW HEAT LIGHTING: Safe to touch



LEDs are cool to touch because they generally don't produce heat in the form of IR. We designed the ""Glowing Street Light Effect"" by having the LEDs conceal along the side of the frame, a similar technique to the edge-light system for light guide panel (ELS-LGP).
With the city street layer placed on top, the heat is placed further from light source making the lamp surface low in heat and safe to touch even for playing.

in your wall “.

No more need for screws or nails as wooll-e is a unique ready to hang lamp.The wooll-e is a lamp that doesn’t require any tools. Only a power outlet and blank wall space.Dutch-designed to be quick-‘n- easy. No more drilling holes in your walls. Simply stick the wooll-e discs on your wall and the wooll-e FIX will do the rest!


The wooll-e® is designed as a fun
product, that encourages you to be creative. 


Change the appearance of your wooll-e lamp by just slipping the
specially designed wooll-e sleeve over the lampshade. You can even turn the extra electric cord into
a cool feature by arranging it with the wooll-e clip, that fastens in three
positions. 

Each Dutch-designed wooll-e lamps is handmade in the Netherlands with high quality materials, sourced locally where possible.  Created with input from experts and people around the world, the wooll-e is an artful and practical lamp at an affordable price.



We want to wooll-e the world
We chose conciously for the crowdfunding indiegogo platform to launch the wooll-e, as we know indiegogo by heart contributing to projects we liked to help people's dreams come true. We reached a national and international crowd and built a wooll-e community from whoms feedback we'll learn and who helped us take wooll-e into production.  

- This is what some of the earlybirds wrote about the wooll-e, "" A clever little lamp inspired by pure dutch design : minimalist,
experimental, innovative, quirky, and above all humorous !”, "" Got two
left hands?Then this crowdfunded
no-drilling-needed wall lamp is for you."" and  “the solution for many
of us who are not allowed to drill a hole (cause you'r renting) or don't want
to ruin a wall with another hole in it! ” - Campaign is over but I want to light my life with wooll-e

You can, just sent us an e-mail and we'll get in touch with you.
What's in the box?

1 felt sleeve of 100% wool

1 double-layered lampshade (15cm)


1 iFix or oFix (depends on your choice)


3 meters electric cord, fitting with
integrated on/off switch and plug


1 clip to organize the electric
cord 


2 high quality metal discs


Extra special tape

Clear instructions

Sleeves


6 exciting colour combinations you can choose from. 
It’s easy to change
the appearance of your wooll-e lamp. We have designed a felt sleeve, handmade
of 100% wool in the Netherlands. You simply slip the sleeve over the
lampshade. It contrasts nicely with the lampshade and gives you the freedom to
create your own look. Just position the sleeve to suit you. On the top, middle
or bottom of the lampshade.




Colour combinations for the felt sleeves*

ash grey / royal orange

coal grey / turquoise blue

grass green / lime green

turquoise blue / royal orange

mustard yellow / turquoise blue

hot pink / mustard yellow

Lampshades
The lampshades we
use are handmade to our specifications in the Netherlands. Double-layered to give the lampshade the firmness we
like. On the outside we use off-white textile and silverish-grey on the inside for
that little extra reflection. So even without the sleeve the lampshade can be a
shining light on your wall.

FIX
The
FIX is a superior magnet sunken into a holder made of nylon
granule. The design of the magnet holder gives you a good grip and protects the
surface from  damage.  
Inside and outside

the iFIX (i = in) is a loose holder to be placed on the inside of the wooll-e
lamp-shade,  hardly visable and is flexibile
to position. the oFIX (o = out) is a holder to attach on the outside of the wooll-e lamp-shade,
visable and quick-‘n-easy for moving it from spot to spot. Both holders are produced exclusively to order.






Electric
cord
The wooll-e is
provided with 3 meters of electric cord in 4 different colours. A shiny
anthracite as base colour to match every wooll-e and 3 vibrant colours to make
exciting combinations:luscious green, ice blue and signal orange.



Colours for the electric cord*

shiny anthracite
lucious green
ice blue
signal orange

"" For the international wooll-e fans we've a special adapter, so you don't need to
change the cool plug! "" 
Clip
The
clip is designed to organise your electric cord. It can fasten in three
positions. Each clip is made in the Netherlands with a 3-D printer using nylon
granules. When the printing process is finished, it is polished. This gives the
clip a unique look and feel.


Be a good scoutSince
your wooll-e comes with 3 meters of electric cord and your power outlet might
be within 2 meters, instead of hiding the extra electric cord you can turn it
into a cool feature. This way it becomes an integral part of the lamp. We
already made some suggestions for you, but be a good scout and invent new
ones!

<h2>A Kitchen Staple Re-imagined </h2>
<p>Any chef will tell you: <strong>The most important tool in the kitchen is a knife.</strong>  Even in modern kitchens with high-tech equipment, the most ancient tool of all remains mostly unchanged. That doesn't mean there is no room for improvement...</p>
<p> </p>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://bareknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BARE-kickstarter-header.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Introducing BARE knives, a new take on a kitchen staple. While the basics of a great knife still hold, high quality steel, a sharp edge and an comfortable handle, a truly modern knife should face the challenges of its generation. By streamlining the production process and offsetting carbon emissions, we created a knife that is not only the perfect tool, but also is carbon negative.</p><p>We spent over a year trying to find the perfect combination of materials and production methods to realise our vision. Our signature mountain pattern brings the beauty of nature back into your kitchen while our hardwood handle ensures perfect grip. And the best thing, a BARE knife doesn't break the bank.</p><p> </p><h2>Every (Home)Chef Needs One </h2><p>A great knife transforms even the most tedious of tasks into something to look forward to, chopping an onion in seconds and preparing a complete salad in minutes. </p><p>The 8-inch chef knife is likely the most versatile tool in your kitchen, whether you're a home cook or Michelin star chef. With this single knife you can cut, dice, slice, mince, and chop anything from fine fish to fresh veggies.  A good sharp knife cuts precise, clean, and saves you precious time.</p><p>Cooking is the only way to take back control of what goes into your body. Cooking is essential for a healthy lifestyle. Cooking shouldn't be a chore. It should be a joy! A good sharp knife helps to put the fun back in cooking. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://bareknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BARE-kickstarter-chopping-comp.gif"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>Tested and approved by chefs</h2><p>We asked ourselves: '<i>If we could only have a single knife, what would it look like?</i>' To find out if we succeeded in our design challenge we handed our first production samples over to some chefs. We asked them to use the knife as a daily driver for several weeks. Guess what? Our chef's unanimously agreed: BARE knives are restaurant-proof. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595499791/dap5o5usxssag1zwzppn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595499679/frz6j5ktp0vtvd2favpz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>What Makes Our Knives So Great?</h2><p>Check out all the sharp details that go into making a BARE chef knife. Our knife design follows the same approach as our sustainability policy: no compromises. We didn't just want the best knife for the planet. We wanted the best knife on the planet. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595500527/hxwgyxvnyf2yelkkdphr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Lifetime warranty</h2><p>We believe in the quality of our knives. We set out to make something sustainable. Something that lasts. To reinforce this we offer a lifetime limited warranty on manufacturing defects.</p><p> </p><h2>Razor Sharp Value</h2><p>Our knife goes straight from our hands to yours. It's so simple, we're amazed it's gotten so out of fashion. This way, we get to do what we love and you get incredible value for money. That's what we call fair pricing.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://bareknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Infograpic-Price-.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Our revolutionary production method enables us to offer you harder knife that keeps a better edge without the premium other brands demand. A harder steel means you knife is sharper for longer, enabling you to do what you love: Cook!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://bareknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hardness-chart.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://bareknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zooming-gif.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>The BARE Forging Process</h2><p>Formed under tremendous pressure. Hardened and sharpened to perfection. A knife built to last.</p><p>After the mountain pattern is forged into the steel, the Chef knives are heated to over 800 degrees Celsius, before being rapidly cooled to dramatically increase the hardness of the steel. Each chef’s knife is then sharpened by hand, to a razor sharp edge. A Wenge natural hardwood handle is then fitted to ensure perfect grip even in wet conditions. By reinventing the manufacturing process, we are able to produce an exceptional tool for an amazing price. </p><p>Because the mountain imprint in our chef's knives is only 0.25 millimeters deep you don't have to worry of any food getting stuck in the pattern. Simple wash the knife under a running tap, wipe it dry and the blade is clean as a whistle.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595501104/pgpfsrdoutztaodlmfao.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Carbon Negative</h2><p>We believe in responsible production. We compensate all CO2 used to make and ship your knife <strong>10 times over</strong>. </p><p>We look at it this way: <strong>what if all products you bought had their CO2 compensated</strong> 10 times? What if all companies took this clean approach to production? We think the world would soon be a lot cleaner.</p><p>In the Indian region of Raichur there is a serious shortage of wood due to deforestation. Moreover, the traditional way of cooking causes a lot of harmful smoke indoors, and women must spend a lot of time gathering wood. Burning wood to cook is also very inefficient and produces a lot of CO2. For every knife, we make a donation to help provide these women with convenient, clean burning stoves. Thereby reducing CO2 emissions and improving their standard of life.</p><p>This way, everybody benefits and your funding pledge is Carbon Negative.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://bareknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Carbon-footprint.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>The Magnet Strip</h2><p>Once in a while you'll probably want to put the knife down, if only for a moment. Our beautiful hardwood magnet strip will securely hold your knife until you're ready to dice on. The magnet strip measures 45 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm (17.7 x 2.5 x 1 inch). Mounting hardware included!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://bareknives.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Magnet-strip-loop.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>The Rewards</h2><p>The early bird gets the worm!

We spent over a year to develop the perfect chef's knife.

Our manufacturing partners are ready to rock.</p><h2>What We Need</h2><p>To be able to offer our knife to the public for the incredibly competitive price we have set, we need volume.

Any chef will tell you: The most important tool in the kitchen is a knife.  Even in modern kitchens with high-tech equipment, the most ancient tool of all remains mostly unchanged. That doesn't mean there is no room for improvement...
 
 Introducing BARE knives, a new take on a kitchen staple. While the basics of a great knife still hold, high quality steel, a sharp edge and an comfortable handle, a truly modern knife should face the challenges of its generation. By streamlining the production process and offsetting carbon emissions, we created a knife that is not only the perfect tool, but also is carbon negative.We spent over a year trying to find the perfect combination of materials and production methods to realise our vision. Our signature mountain pattern brings the beauty of nature back into your kitchen while our hardwood handle ensures perfect grip. And the best thing, a BARE knife doesn't break the bank. Every (Home)Chef Needs One A great knife transforms even the most tedious of tasks into something to look forward to, chopping an onion in seconds and preparing a complete salad in minutes. The 8-inch chef knife is likely the most versatile tool in your kitchen, whether you're a home cook or Michelin star chef. With this single knife you can cut, dice, slice, mince, and chop anything from fine fish to fresh veggies.  A good sharp knife cuts precise, clean, and saves you precious time.Cooking is the only way to take back control of what goes into your body. Cooking is essential for a healthy lifestyle. Cooking shouldn't be a chore. It should be a joy! A good sharp knife helps to put the fun back in cooking.  Tested and approved by chefsWe asked ourselves: 'If we could only have a single knife, what would it look like?' To find out if we succeeded in our design challenge we handed our first production samples over to some chefs. We asked them to use the knife as a daily driver for several weeks. Guess what? Our chef's unanimously agreed: BARE knives are restaurant-proof.  What Makes Our Knives So Great?Check out all the sharp details that go into making a BARE chef knife. Our knife design follows the same approach as our sustainability policy: no compromises. We didn't just want the best knife for the planet. We wanted the best knife on the planet.  Lifetime warrantyWe believe in the quality of our knives. We set out to make something sustainable. Something that lasts. To reinforce this we offer a lifetime limited warranty on manufacturing defects. Razor Sharp ValueOur knife goes straight from our hands to yours. It's so simple, we're amazed it's gotten so out of fashion. This way, we get to do what we love and you get incredible value for money. That's what we call fair pricing.   Our revolutionary production method enables us to offer you harder knife that keeps a better edge without the premium other brands demand. A harder steel means you knife is sharper for longer, enabling you to do what you love: Cook!  The BARE Forging ProcessFormed under tremendous pressure. Hardened and sharpened to perfection. A knife built to last.After the mountain pattern is forged into the steel, the Chef knives are heated to over 800 degrees Celsius, before being rapidly cooled to dramatically increase the hardness of the steel. Each chef’s knife is then sharpened by hand, to a razor sharp edge. A Wenge natural hardwood handle is then fitted to ensure perfect grip even in wet conditions. By reinventing the manufacturing process, we are able to produce an exceptional tool for an amazing price. Because the mountain imprint in our chef's knives is only 0.25 millimeters deep you don't have to worry of any food getting stuck in the pattern. Simple wash the knife under a running tap, wipe it dry and the blade is clean as a whistle. Carbon NegativeWe believe in responsible production. We compensate all CO2 used to make and ship your knife 10 times over. We look at it this way: what if all products you bought had their CO2 compensated 10 times? What if all companies took this clean approach to production? We think the world would soon be a lot cleaner.In the Indian region of Raichur there is a serious shortage of wood due to deforestation. Moreover, the traditional way of cooking causes a lot of harmful smoke indoors, and women must spend a lot of time gathering wood. Burning wood to cook is also very inefficient and produces a lot of CO2. For every knife, we make a donation to help provide these women with convenient, clean burning stoves. Thereby reducing CO2 emissions and improving their standard of life.This way, everybody benefits and your funding pledge is Carbon Negative. The Magnet StripOnce in a while you'll probably want to put the knife down, if only for a moment. Our beautiful hardwood magnet strip will securely hold your knife until you're ready to dice on. The magnet strip measures 45 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm (17.7 x 2.5 x 1 inch). Mounting hardware included! The RewardsThe early bird gets the worm! We offer unique deals to our backers on Indiegogo . We need your help to make BARE Knives a reality!   How We Got HereModern production methods such as 3D printing allowed us to experiment with different blade shapes and handle designs. We spent over a year to develop the perfect chef's knife. Hundreds of sketches, CAD models and 3D prints later and the BARE knife is born.   Where We AreOur tooling is ready. Every part of the knife has been tested and optimized.  Our knives have been tested in restaurants and by dozens of home chefs. We have sorted out our supply chain and packaging design. Our manufacturing partners are ready to rock.What We NeedTo be able to offer our knife to the public for the incredibly competitive price we have set, we need volume. We can only produce the knives affordably when manufacturing in large batches. We need you to help us finance our first large scale production run. We believe we've made a gorgeous and super-functional kitchen tool. And we hope you do so too.TimelineOur focus is on rewarding you with the best possible chef knife. We will not ship a single knife until we are confident we have lived up to this promise. We aim to deliver all rewards by November. Our manufacturing partners are convinced this is a realistic goal. However, the current global health crisis has proven to be unpredictable to say the least. We will do our absolute best to deliver you rewards in time, should any unforeseen circumstances impede us in doing so we will keep you updated every step of the way. Return policy. Indiegogo is platform that allows innovators to offer their creations and ideas at discounted prices.

We have complete confidence in our product and our supply chain.Production method Our biggest challenge lies in our production method, the development of anything novel carries risks, the manufacturing technique we use to produce our unique mountain pattern is brand new. When trying to do something new you always run the chance of encountering new problems. We are lucky to have extremely knowledgeable production partners that are up to any challenge.Covid-19 The world is currently facing a global pandemic. We thought long and hard about postponing our campaign. Our manufacturing partners are operating at 100% and our entire team, while slightly stir-crazy, can't wait to get this product out in the world. We can't deny there is a chance the current health crisis might affect our ability to manufacture and ship your rewards.

We can guarantee we will do our absolute best to ensure each and every backer gets their reward in the least amount of time possible.If there are any delays or roadblocks down the road, we promise you transparency and regular updates.Environmental commitmentsBARE Knives are designed with the environment in mind. Here you can read some of the steps we take to ensure our knives are as green as can be.Long-lasting designOur steel choice is corrosion resistant and can withstand extended use.
