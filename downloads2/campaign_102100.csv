<h3>VR/Desktop Social Platform</h3>
<p>A VR and desktop social platform that expands the limitations of creativity, social interactions, and community involvement using Unreal Engine. Create content (avatars, worlds, etc.), share them with the rest of the community, and play with others.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608848948/btrtdteixg6ltz6tejhp.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Create.</h3>
<p>Creative components is one of many beloved features that a game has to offer, which is why I’ll expand more upon it. Players will have the opportunity to create, creative and artistic avatars, worlds, home worlds, and more. Everything can be edited and customized in a platitude of ways. Assets can be modified by shaders, colors, animations, particles, mesh, etc. Avatars can be customized even more thanks to additional features on them. Avatars will be able to lip sync the users voice using premade animations for vowels or facial tracking, have custom intro and outro animations, support eye tracking, full body, and even full finger tracking. Content can be created using FBX or any other supported format by Unreal Engine. This game encourages creators to create unimaginable things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608849134/qpyxcxhug51msvgdwnnm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Share.</h3>
<p>Creators will find it more easier to share their creations to the world. With the help of our SDK, create and effortlessly upload content. Creators are able to share things from worlds to avatars and make them public so others can see and experience them. Creators can also upload assets to our in-game market, where we'll be hosting our own assets that users may use. This gives the creator the opportunity to contribute to the community and be recognized for their work. The creators opportunities are endless and with the help of us, we'll be able to encourage and promote their work.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Play!</h3>
<p>Explore from many worlds and avatars made by the community. Players will be able to play among many others or with their friends. This project won’t just be for players looking for a game to just play. This game will add more functionality to a broad demographic. Those who love media and entertainment will be able to do astonishing things like capturing full body movements, real time scenes of other players acting out scenes, and actual tools to develop films. One might get some friends together in an instance of the game, be able to act out scenes, capture it using a variety of in game cameras with filters, and export it. Architects will also find multiple uses for this game. They will be able to design and apply their designs in a surreal environment. This game will also offer tools for education. For example, teachers can pick an environment that’s similar to their class. This class will have good lighting, a whiteboard to write on, and themes. They could pre record their lecture or broadcast it live to the students. Play it your way!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<ul>
<li>With a backing of $10, you'll get a personal thank you, along with a background for your username and a badge. You will digitally earn this exclusive background that will be placed behind your username, along with a badge. This will present to others that you have backed the game in the early stages of development.</li>
<li>With a backing of $20, not only will you get all previous items obtained in the first but also get 2 weeks of early access, reservation of a username, and get the game at a 33% discounted price.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other features</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Market</h3>
<p>To encourage, innovate, and help creators envision their creations, we will develop a market that can be accessed from in-game. We want to make it easier for users to find assets and create with ease. The market will host a variety of assets, some being avatars, animations, props, and more. Players who like an asset, can either download it or buy it, depending if it's free or not. Players are able to help creators out by buying from them or even in a form of donation. Creators who show their passion and help the community, can also earn a verification badge, certifying their work. The game will also host a virtual market, where players are able to physically walk around vendors. Creators will able to collaborate with others and market.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>We wanted to add achievements to those who like playing games with an objective in mind. We plan on implementing achievements that can be earned by playing, doing tasks, and more. Achievements are a great way of encouraging players into engaging with the community and add another level of playability. Some achievements will help toward leveling up or earning cosmetics for their account. We also plan to be working side by side with community creators in the future, to add achievements dedicated to their worlds.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>We plan on implementing a variety of events. An example of some events that the community can be expecting are seasonal events. Worlds would be modified with decorations and tasks depending on the season. Almost in every event, there will be limited timed and exclusive rewards for those who participate. Events are made for the community to have something to look forward to and also for the community to be more involved with one another. Events can also be done randomly to surprise players when we drop more content. We also plan in introducing new game mechanics or features in the form of events. To show gratitude toward helping the development of this project, the first event will start shortly after launch of the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social</h3>
<p>We love the idea of players being social and connected to one another, so we decided to develop an app for that. The app will aide players into keeping connections with their favorite friends online, finding communities, keeping up with events, and much more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Game mechanics</h3>
<p>We plan on implementing fun game mechanics that can be used by creators. One fun game mechanic that we will be providing at launch is a climb mechanic. This let's the player be able to climb about anything or only limited to specific meshes by simulating actually climbing. We will providing a more depth and sophisticated functionality in further development of the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Priority</h3>
<p>Some of our current priorities are optimization, community involvement, and creativity. Optimization when it comes to VR is really important. Optimization ensures that the player is well immersed and that the player will not get sick. Worlds and avatars will vary in depending on the creator but with the right tweaks, we will make them more effective when rendering, making them less likely to drop performance while ensuring optimization. Community involvement is also important, when developing. We want to make a game that is creative, yet effective that the community is able to easily access, create, and engage with the rest of the community. Lastly, creativity is another priority when it comes to the development of the game. We want to help ensure that creators are able to create and do the unimaginable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Compatibility/cross-platform</h3>
<p>We will be developing our game with optimization in mind for all hardware. Whether your on desktop or VR, never feel afraid of losing performance. We plan on developing the game with even the Oculus Quest 2 in mind. With the help of a in-game graphics management page, change from preferences to graphical settings. We also plan to implement more ways for desktop users to properly interact and play with VR users.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
</div><div>
<p>My goal for this game is to unite players alike. Whether you're playing the game to make friends, create amazing architects, films, experience worlds outside reality itself, etc. I want this application to be easily accessible and help people find or form groups that they can interact with. I also have high hopes that people will be able to make some of the best creative content and share them with the world. I want the game to constantly push the limits and innovate others in doing the same. Hopefully, this will also ease players into using Unreal Engine. There is a misconception among many that Unreal Engine is only for Triple-A games. I would like to show them that everyone is capable. Thank you for giving the opportunity for us to give back to the community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funds</h3>
<p>All the funds raised from this site or anywhere else, will be invested directly only into the project. Funds are important for the development of our game because of time consumption, hardware, assets, servers, lack of documentation, and workers pay. If the project doesn't reach the goal of $250,000, the remaining funds will still only go into investment of the project. I'll continue to develop the game with some colleagues, using the money to invest in essentials to developing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With new technology, means more hurdles to jump over. Since VR is still fairly new, the development of the project will slightly take longer than a typical game. The lack of documentation on developing VR games using Unreal Engine is very well limited. We also need to account of time and resources to properly implement profiles, in-game market, and more. Not only will we have to keep in mind of our SDK, optimization, we will need to also worry about how to incorporate them. A lot of our time in development will be used on researching and developing new and beneficial ways of getting our result. </p>

Other cool stuff: Playrific is working hard on moving the art and science of gesture interpretation ahead. One of the things we are working hard on is new ways of social play with multiple children and multiple devices.
In collaborative or competitive social play, multiple Gazintus can be manipulated by multiple kids in a patent-pending, multi-user, location-based social play mode.

The team




Our creative and technical team consists of folks from a wide variety of gaming, IT, education, military, and sales and marketing backgrounds.  We're a little bit silly. But we're also a lot bit serious. Because fun is serious business.






What will Playrific use the funds for?


We have knowledge and expertise in bringing
new tech to consumers, but our team will bring in other experts to make it
happen faster and more robustly. Stretch goals start at 120K when we will add a
Minecraft hook in, and include more software, more features and more cool games
and other ideas you send us.
Our company's track record
Playrific, Inc., the company that is working on the Gazintu, was established in 2010 and has successfully delivered an ""app factory"" platform that helps family-friendly brands bring their characters and brand to COPPA (kid friendly) compliant mobile apps.  Our CEO and CTO have deep contacts in the hardware, software, and supply chain. They have both built and brought multiple firms to successful exits.


CEO Beth Marcus is a pioneer in virtual reality (VR), having designed, among other things, products for NASA--that are still used--as well as the SideWinder force feedback joystick that was acquired by Microsoft. Beth founded 5 companies, including Playrific and is on the faculty of MIT. 

The rest of the team consists of folks who have built billion dollar firms, educational marketing experts, military veterans, and artists and animators with deep talent.If you have any questions, please email gazintu@playrific.com or post them on this campaign page.

The game takes a more serious and modern approach to the traditional collect-a-thon platformers seen on the Nintendo 64, by that we mean it focuses more on character development, story and takes more risks along the lines of the later <i>Jak and Daxter</i>  games. We don't want to force exploration but reward you for doing so by planting secret items and collectables. The collecting aspect is greatly inspired by <i>Banjo Kazooie</i> so expect to find lots of cool things while exploring.</p><p>NPCs in the game will offer you quests in return for Golden Scrolls which are the ""Jiggies, Power Cells, 3D Mario Stars"" of the game. The combat will have two modes, when you lock onto a character you will enter a 1V1 combat stance where you can do special combos and moves to one character and anybody foolish enough to be near it. This fighting style is similar to <i>Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">. When Not locked on you are in an open mode where it's <i>God of War</i> like and you attack multiple enemies.</span></p><p>You will be able to play as two different characters each with their own unique play style and movesets which can be used to solve puzzles or reach places the other can't. Kori is a stealthy ranged fighter while Niko is a hack and slash brawler. The way you switch is similar to <i>Donkey Kong 64 </i>which means only 1 character can be in the world at a time and can be switched in certain parts of the world. We are planning on having some kind of Co-op mode but it will be a challenge to put in the game so it's going  to be a stretch goal.</p><p>The game will be on PC and if we get enough money we can get it on more platforms like Console and maybe even handheld.</p><p><b>Graphics</b></p><p>The game is currently being made with Torque 3D using the Action Adventure Kit provided by Ubiq Visuals as a base but if we get enough funding we can afford to switch to Unity, CryEngine or even Unreal Engine and be able to release the game on more platforms. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Nintendo 64 Mode (if there's an audience for it)</b></p><p>Plans have been made to have a mode that makes the game feel like it was made for the Nintendo 64 with a low poly feel similar to how <i>Shovel Knight </i>seems like it's made for the NES. This was originally the way the game was going to be but after research many people didn't like the old low poly look and said it would seem lazy when that's not the reason at all. If there's an audience for a low poly N64 feel game we'd gladly make it and it will make it easier for us to make the game that way.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/804005/files/20140821192620-Untitled-2.gif?1408674380"" src="""" style=""width: 275.431654676259px; height: 155px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/804017/files/20140821194127-Untitled-3.gif?1408675287"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 276.377952755906px; height: 156px; background-color: initial;""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/823180/files/20140830134302-title-story.png?1409431382"" src="""" style=""width: 281.9375px; height: 91px;""/></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><figcaption><p></p>

Rewards might be changed like the Promotional buttons to help reduce costs that physical rewards bring, Additional NotesMost of the stuff you see here is placeholder like the logos, maps and music. All early stuff that will no doubt be improved upon in the future. The characters don't necessarily have official outfits as they will wear something different every level and these are just the ones we liked best. If you would like to see sketches of other outfits feel free to check the gallery.Special Thanks and Art CreditsWe want to thank and credit the fellow Deviantartists and who helped out with the game and make this campaign possible. If you like something from this campaign and need help with yours I'm sure they have some commissions available.

Quest Remastered is a classic fully animated cartoon point &amp; click adventure
game, inspired by the old school unbelievable adventure games made in the
80s-90s. It has a wacky plot: Zeus the boss of Olympus returns to earth by a craft
made by Hephaestus to save the planet with the help of a time machine. To
achieve that he will have to start a huge adventure in the Greek islands with
over 30 places to visit and hilarious mythology characters to interact. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444139782/aaqfmnjrf8zphfmxb5y6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

The old game didn't have any animation so here we can be very creative. We break the characters into pieces and rig them into puppets. This is how
we can control their movement and achieve 60FPS animation on each platform. Then
we synchronize sounds, speech, music and movements for each screen guided by
the original plot, humor and dialogues of the game. These are only some of the characters Zeus meets:<br/><br/><p></p>

have a flexible funding option. The final product will be translated into

Speech is expensive! If we make more than $22.000 we will be able to put
English Speech in all cinematic scenes available. Our secret wish is to put English

small indie studio ‘CrazySoft Limited’ is operating from 2003 and from then has
developed over 30 titles (games and apps) for more than 20 different platforms
and operating systems! 
Our
current mission is to totally remaster (basically reinvent) an old award
winning adventure game called Zeus Quest. Everything will be remade in FHD fresh vector cartoons, 60FPS fully animated characters and new music and soundtrack. The only thing we will keep intact is the hilarious
plot and dialogues. The remake will be possible with the famous game engine
Unity3D.
Zeus Quest remastered will be initially released on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Windows
Phone 8, Windows Store, Blackberry 10, Online (+ more to come). The final product will support English, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Greek languages. If everything goes as planned it will be released from the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2016!


Zeus
Quest Remastered is a classic fully animated cartoon point & click adventure
game, inspired by the old school unbelievable adventure games made in the
80s-90s. It has a wacky plot: Zeus the boss of Olympus returns to earth by a craft
made by Hephaestus to save the planet with the help of a time machine. To
achieve that he will have to start a huge adventure in the Greek islands with
over 30 places to visit and hilarious mythology characters to interact. 
  Remastering
process What
we do with the old graphics: We take the old screens and process them pixel per pixel and break apart characters, objects and make them wide. Then we master
them to vectors and reprocess all of it pixel per pixel again. If new graphics are
needed we add them and then we are ready to program each screen. This is very
time and effort demanding process and that is why we ask for your help. 

Let the animation begin:
The old game didn't have any animation so here we can be very creative. We break the characters into pieces and rig them into puppets. This is how
we can control their movement and achieve 60FPS animation on each platform. Then
we synchronize sounds, speech, music and movements for each screen guided by
the original plot, humor and dialogues of the game. These are only some of the characters Zeus meets:

  Zeus
Quest Places
 The
theme of the game is Greek Mythology and ancient Greek time-frame. The game has a
huge plot which happens in 2 maps and in Minoan Crete. Zeus will end up abducting
the girl Europe (continent named after her), transform into bull and travel to Minoan Crete to enable the time machine and save the planet.










  Rewards  Go
ahead and help us out and we will reward you with many cool things plus the
game in multiple platforms. There will also be a way to save your process
online and be able to continue playing in some other platform. E.g: Start playing
at your PC and continue at your iPad from where you left of.

Olá!
Meu nome éAlicia

Quando somos abençoados financeiramente, não
tem problema aumentarmos no nosso padrão  de vida; mas isso deve vir acompanhado de um
aumento no padrão de doação.
Usando um pouco de criatividade dessa vez com
minhas habilidades de TI, eu desenvolvi alguns jogos para a plataforma iOS
voltados para a conservação
da natureza. Um desses jogos éo Conserve a Amazônia, um aplicativo dedicado ao trabalho do Instituto Mamirauá na floresta amazônica, que contém:
•  5,5 milhões de quilômetros quadrados de floresta
•  engloba 9 países
da América do Sul
•  390 bilhões de árvores de ~16.000 espécies
•  1/10 de todas as espécies
da terra
•  a floresta mais biodiversa do planeta!
O jogo possui uma parte educativa, “Os animais"" explicando sobre as espécies presentes no jogo, o porque estarem
ameaçados e como a
conservação pode ajudar.
Os jogos para iOS têm sido bem-sucedidos, e assim gostaríamos que compartilhar a experiência de um jogo educativo e ajudar a divulgar a causa para a

Project Hardcore is an ode to everything that is so awesome and so totally badass about video games. It's the game I would have made as a kid, if I knew what I was doing. 
20 Years later and I know exactly what I'm doing. Now I need your help to make it a reality.

What I Need & What You Get
  I'm looking to raise $5000 USD. A portion of this will go towards the cost of the Wii U development hardware, with remainder going towards the creation of original artwork.Any extra funding (up to $2000) will go towards marketing and promoting the game (online advertising).If I exceed $7500 during the campaign I will start adding stretch goals, including:
exploring the possibility of releasing on other platforms (Xbox One, PC)
increasing the scope of the game and/or exploring episodic content (i.e.  additional ""badasses"", another 8 levels)






 
In exchange for your support I'm offering several perks, ranging from early access to the game,  a copy of the sound-track, or your name in the credits. 
(Have an idea for a perk? Drop me a line, I'm more than happy to create custom perks!)
If I don't reach my funding goal I will be self-funding the difference. 
That's how committed I am to seeing this through to completion.   Risks & Challenges  The biggest known risk at this point is getting the word out there, I plan to get around this by investing a portion of any excess funding into promotion.
If I'm not able to use ""traditional"" advertising channels due to budgetary constraints (and even if I am), I plan on getting ""social"" and taking a grassroots approach:

engaging fans of the genre through social media channels

engaging independent game reviewers (i.e. YouTube), ensuring they have early access to the game

encouraging the gaming community to speed-run the game, record and share their results

hosting a local launch party

We are a small team that has set their minds
on making video games. We hope many people will find them entertaining and
interesting. We worked with different teams on different projects in the past
and this helped us gain experience and hone our skills—though there is always
room for further development. However, it made us realize that all the stories
we were coming up with were not up to par with some of their well-known and
successful contemporaries. This is exactly why we would like to do something
innovative and fresh and that is why the four of us came together to make a
horror game that is actually going to be frightening and blood-curdling. We

</div> “Nox Aeternum” is a first-person horror game that mainly relies on storytelling and unpredictability . This game is for real horror aficionados and everyone who enjoys visually realistic games. The plot reveals itself through various notes found in the game, enemies and environment itself. Multi-layered story unwinds as the player progresses through the game. The game is situated in the 14<span style=""font-size: 12px;line-height: 0;vertical-align: baseline;"">th</span> century after The Black Death. The protagonist is a liege lord against whom a cabal of shadowy figures conspire. We pride ourselves on the fact that we have not included any jump scares, or cheap scares in the game. Every monster in the game was individually and carefully programmed and is a completely separate A.I. Enemies have their own personalities and mood changes. Based on their mood swings, their actions change accordingly. We are trying to create environment that is ever changing and alive. This game features a non-linear gameplay in which the events are not sequenced in a particular order they completely depend on what the player does. Our main influences include H.P. Lovecraft, and several fantasy games.<div>

on making video games. We hope many people will find them entertaining and
interesting. We worked with different teams on different projects in the past
and this helped us gain experience and hone our skills—though there is always
room for further development. However, it made us realize that all the stories
we were coming up with were not up to par with some of their well-known and
successful contemporaries. This is exactly why we would like to do something
innovative and fresh and that is why the four of us came together to make a
horror game that is actually going to be frightening and blood-curdling. We
would like to make something that is not going to be like the thousand others
in the video game industry that has been saturated with a plethora of titles
that are ripping each other off. We believe that a game is like a canvas for
personal expression and this is evident in the way we try to incorporate a
piece of ourselves into it. If this campaign is successful we will be able focus
on this project with all our might and we will give it our best shot.

  Our goal is to open an arcade and gaming cafe focused primarily on hosting tournaments for popular games on various consoles. The local gaming community near Marysville, WA, just an hour north of down town Seattle. Is in need of a safe and friendly space for people of all ages to spectate and play together, both casually and competitively. Yes, I said spectate! There are some people that don't actually play these games, but are a fan of the sport! Simply put, eSport is a video game competition.


Esports are the most popular spectator 


 



We want to work with local high schools and offer incentives for passing grades and promote teamwork by hosting seasonal tournaments for high school teams. This might inspire those who aren't active in sports to keep passing grades for something they are active in, esports.             

Choose a Clan!

Dungeon Gaming will have 3 clans that consist of gaming ""family"" members. You choose which one to be a part of. 



 Clan of spirit, determination and courage.

Clan of wisdom, intellect and cunning.


Clan of vitality, ability and confidence.

Each clan will accumulate points per members placement 1st-3rd place. The clan with the most points at the end of a season (winter, spring, summer, fall) will earn that season's trophy in the Clans trophy case in house and each winnings clans member will receive a prize! 



  
Our startup costs are close to $120k and consist of the following:

<p>Imagine playing the popular ""war"" card game with actual warriors from history, or playing a battlefield strategy game in which you get to organize an army to capture your opponent's castle using the greatest warriors from history all fighting together at the same time and place, or playing the popular ""memory"" game with pairs of historical warriors. And imagine playing capture the flag outside and giving each player a role to play as a specific warrior from history. You can!, with Royal Combat: Warriors of History.</p>
<p><b>See our website for the full rules and instructions, videos and more about our other games: <a href=""http://www.bartlbrothers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bartlbrothers.com</a></b></p>
<p><b>With Royal Combat: Warriors of History you are essentially getting 4 games in 1. </b> </p>
<h1>""Basic Battle""</h1>
<p>This method of play is very similar to the popular ""war"" card game.  The difference is that you get to choose which card from your hand to put down and you play war with actual warriors from history!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432417460/ajbfcidvommiyj6hsur0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1> ""Battlefield""</h1>
<p>This play method has a combination of calculated strategy play and taking risks and gives the same feel of a board game. Each player has a castle they must defend with a castle guard and a front line they must advance into the battlefield and against opponent's castles. So this game is similar to strategy board games such as chess, checkers, and stratego. And it has the battlefield uncertainties faced in games such as Risk.</p>

<h1>""Memory""</h1>
<p>The ""Memory"" play method is exactly the same as the popular memory game. The only difference is that you are playing it with the really cool <i>Royal Combat: Warriors of History</i> cards.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432424540/olv9ra9qdtdcsv6vc1ke.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>""Capture the Castle""</h1>
<p>""Capture the Castle"" is very similar to the popular outdoor active game ""Capture the Flag"". The difference is that you are using the Royal Combat: Warriors of History cards to give players different ranks and allow them to role play different characters in the game. This is one of the funnest games ever :)</p>

<h1>PRIMARY GOAL: $1,000 - enhanced artwork for each card, first bulk order of games</h1>
<p>Reaching this goal will provide a level of artwork on each card seen in the Spartan/Viking animation that is contained in supplemental videos on this page (not the ""basic battle"" animation in the main video). They also have a brief presence in the main project video.  The drawings from those animations will be on the Spartan and Viking cards and each of the other warriors will have the same level of artwork completed for them.  Depending on which stretch goal we reach, the artwork will be even better.</p>

</div><div><h3><br/></h3></div></div>","We are grateful :) for your support and your consideration of this project. 


This game was developed over this past year and a prototype has been made. Our goal for this campaign is to raise enough money to hire an artist to make enhanced illustrations for each card in the game, to make our first bulk order, and to launch our game into the market. 
We hope you will give us the opportunity to share our games with you and to help our new business launch to succeed. If you would like to back us click on the  button up and to the right => ^ and see the list of Royal Perks you can choose from down and to the right => v 
You can also support us by posting this page on your social media and encouraging others to back us.  Feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools.         Thank you!!

 Why make a pledge to our game?
    
Imagine playing the popular ""war"" card game with actual warriors from history, or playing a battlefield strategy game in which you get to organize an army to capture your opponent's castle using the greatest warriors from history all fighting together at the same time and place, or playing the popular ""memory"" game with pairs of historical warriors. And imagine playing capture the flag outside and giving each player a role to play as a specific warrior from history. You can!, with Royal Combat: Warriors of History.
See our website for the full rules and instructions, videos and more about our other games: http://www.bartlbrothers.com
With Royal Combat: Warriors of History you are essentially getting 4 games in 1.  
""Basic Battle""
This method of play is very similar to the popular ""war"" card game.  The difference is that you get to choose which card from your hand to put down and you play war with actual warriors from history!

 ""Battlefield""
This play method has a combination of calculated strategy play and taking risks and gives the same feel of a board game. Each player has a castle they must defend with a castle guard and a front line they must advance into the battlefield and against opponent's castles. So this game is similar to strategy board games such as chess, checkers, and stratego. And it has the battlefield uncertainties faced in games such as Risk.

""Memory""
The ""Memory"" play method is exactly the same as the popular memory game. The only difference is that you are playing it with the really cool Royal Combat: Warriors of History cards.

""Capture the Castle""
""Capture the Castle"" is very similar to the popular outdoor active game ""Capture the Flag"". The difference is that you are using the Royal Combat: Warriors of History cards to give players different ranks and allow them to role play different characters in the game. This is one of the funnest games ever :)

The bottom line for each of these games is that they are so fun you will want to keep playing.

 52 cards in each deck


 26 for a red team and 26 for a blue team


There are 4 categories of players: Gold Star, Silver Star, Green Star, and Shadow

 Higher Ranks Capture Lower Ranks

But Higher Ranks have weaknesses from some lower Ranks


PRIMARY GOAL: $1,000 - enhanced artwork for each card, first bulk order of games
Reaching this goal will provide a level of artwork on each card seen in the Spartan/Viking animation that is contained in supplemental videos on this page (not the ""basic battle"" animation in the main video). They also have a brief presence in the main project video.  The drawings from those animations will be on the Spartan and Viking cards and each of the other warriors will have the same level of artwork completed for them.  Depending on which stretch goal we reach, the artwork will be even better.
Please Help Us Reach our Goal!

STRETCH GOALS:
$2,000: Custom-made box containers for each deck of cards.
$3,000: Royal Gold Cards get top-level artistic makeover with special resemblance to particular royal characters from history or literature.
$4,000: Silver and Shadow cards get top-level artistic makeover. 
$5,000: A completely revamped graphic illustrated edition of Royal Combat: Warriors of History gets funded.  The artwork will be as good as any card game in the market.
$7,500: Castle Wall decorated playing mats for card games. 
$10,000+: more awesome games begin production!  See our website for more info.

</p>
<p>
<b>The Setting:</b>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	At the very core of this game stands the idea of a dark fantasy world ruled by ancient, mysterious powers.<br/>
	It is a world where mankind is dying, struggling for survival against both natural dangers and supernatural monsters that roam the wilderness. Travelling is deadly, thus most people live and die within a few miles from the place of their birth.<br/>
	The player characters are men and women lifted from these harsh, deadly lives by the Eight, ancient elemental spirits. They have taken a small part of such a
	spirit into themselves and received both physical and magical power.<br/>
	Armed with this power and the will of the Eight behind them, these warriors, these ""Chosen Ones"", will lift the broken spirit of humanity, unite the scattered clans and villages under one banner and challenge the dark powers that have ruled Scath for over two hundred years. They are the only ones who can save the world...and maybe rule it?
</p>
<p>
<b>Classical Origins:</b>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	""Shadow of the Fomori"" in many ways goes back to the ancient stories of classical heroes that we humans have told each other around the campfires, borrowing heavily from mythological lore, especially the Celtic one. It is a game where players will experience carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, being the only thing standing between the last remnants of humanity and the cold sleep of death.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Journey:</b>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	During their rise to power the Chosen will battle both natural and supernatural dangers. They will explore a land largely unknown, encountering many terrifying creatures. They will realize that the world of Scath is far older than they have been told, and that the only way to win this war they are fighting in, is to uncover the secrets of that forgotten past, a time long before the rise of humanity.<br/>
	In their journey the player characters will meet wondrous, ancient beings with their own agendas and will, depending on their choices, turn them into trusted allies or bitter enemies. The Chosen will bring their people the first victories in over two hundred years and will use them to rekindle the spirits of hope and resistance within the heart of mankind.<br/>
	During all that time the heroes will experience changes within their own bodies and minds. The influence of the Eight is strong, so strong that it might wipe away the humanity within a Chosen himself. Will the player characters be prepared to sever the ties with their friends and family, sacrificing their  body and soul and call it a small price to pay? Or will they hold on to what makes them mortal, struggling to unite the spiritual powers with their own humanity?<br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433700042/ovc0cvk3azmdtthrutsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	""Scath – Shadow of the Fomori"" uses a D20 based rule system with many elements that will be familiar to experienced roleplayers.<br/>
	The aim of the system is to provide a core of fairly simple rules while enabling players and GM's alike to add more complicated, in – depth rules to their own liking, thus giving the characters far more options and hopefully making the game more enjoyable.<br/>
	The combat rules are one of the main focuses of the game, providing five distinct combat styles with over 30 different combat actions. Tied into that – but also very much usable out of combat – are the magic rules, including the eight elemental lores the player characters can use, but also three distinctly different kinds of magic.<br/>
	The gamemaster section also includes rules for leading armies into battle against each other and resolving such conflicts without having to rely on improvisation or hour – long dice rolling.<br/>

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	This is a game for players who enjoy combat, exploration and leadership. The Chosen Ones will have to battle terrible monsters, explore the secrets of a past long forgotten and forge alliances with weird beings. They will also have to unite humanity under one banner and lead them into battle against the evil that has destroyed their forefathers.<br/>
	At the same time, there is also a lot of roleplaying involved. Scath is a world with a dark, mysterious atmosphere, and this atmosphere is very important for a campaign. The weight of the world lies upon the Chosen Ones, and many men have been destroyed by this weight.<br/>
	The player characters themselves are changing and might struggle to adapt to their new natures. Lastly the efforts of unification and alliances provides great chances for roleplaying too: do the player characters want to be tyrants, leading by intimidation and fear, or will they be golden heroes in a world of
	darkness and blood? Will they want to keep all power in their hands, or will they risk giving it away to other, more ""human"" leaders? And how will they react to all the weird characters and alien beings they might encounter, and who might prove either ally or enemy? Only the players can find the answers
	to these questions.<br/>
	Ultimately it is your own decision on which of these elements your RPG group will focus. My belief is that ""Scath"" can be a very enjoyable experience for both groups who want to focus mostly on combat and exploring old ruins and groups whose main interest is in roleplaying and leading large forces or any other combination of the elements mentioned.<br/><br/>

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	Several unusual elements can be found in this setting. Together they make playing in the world of Scath a unique experience for players and gamemasters alike.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Scath is heavily inspired by Celtic mythology, a body of ancient stories and legends that are fairly unknown to most people and are not used as much as they would deserve. Combined with them is a dark fantasy end-times setting, with a whole world on the brink of destruction.
	</li>
<br/>
<li>
		Mankind's technology in the lands of Scath is on a very low level. Most Wilder clans and some of the more primitive villages have been cast back into the stone age, relying on tools of bone, wood and stone. Whilst there might be a few artefacts of iron to be found here and there no one has the ability to create or repair it, and the highest standard of technology left is bronze.<br/>
</li>
<br/>
<li>
		Most knowledge about the past has been lost in the great war. Even the lands themselves are mostly unknown, roamed by monsters. Very few men dare to venture far from the territory around their villages or camps. The player characters will be able to explore a whole world, never knowing what might wait behind the next hill. The players and their characters will both start with next to no information about Scath, thus making metagaming and mixing in/out of character knowledge nearly impossible. This journey of discovery, of finding information about the world, its history and its inhabitants, is one of the most interesting things about Scath.
	</li>
<br/>
<li>
		Scath as a roleplaying game returns to the classical beginnings of heroic tales. The player characters are classical heroes, amongst the very few Chosen Ones that stand between mankind and its utter destruction. The weight of the whole world is on their shoulders.

	With your help the world of Scath will be able to come to life in a book of approximately 250 pages. It will be held almost exclusively in shades of white, grey and black to reflect the bleak, dark atmosphere of the world.<br/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	The book itself will be divided into two large sections. Below you will find a list of contents for both of these sections (subject to minor changes).<br/>
</p>
<h5>The first part: Player's Handbook</h5>
<p>
</p><ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>
			""<b><i>Dead and alive</i></b>"" is a short story showing an outcast's ascension to power.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Introduction: Welcome to a world of Shadow</i></b>"" will talk about the reasons for creating Scath, the atmosphere and main elements of the setting.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Living in a land of fear</i></b>"" describes what little of history is known to men and talks in detail about the two societies of mankind: Villagers and Wilders.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Ancient powers awaken</i></b>"" gives the players background information about the Eight, powerful elemental spirits that give them their abilities and one of which will become closely connected to each and every player character.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Heroes in a dark land</i></b>"" gives players everything they need to know about character creation and the many paths they can chose to become the hero they truly want to be.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>How to be a hero</i></b>"" explains all general rules, giving descriptions of main attributes, skills and feats.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Fields of Blood and Bronze</i></b>"" talks about rules for combat, including the five distinct combat styles two of which each Chosen can learn during his journey.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Forces of the world beyond</i></b>"" explains how magic works in the Scath: Shadow of the Fomori. It also describes in great detail the eight elemental lores which player characters can choose from, including over a hundred different spells and hints on using them both in and out of combat.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Tools of Trade</i></b>"" This final chapter of the player's handbook talks about barter trade and general equipment. It also describes different kinds of weapons and armour both PCs and NPCs can use.
		</li>
<li>
			Scattered throughout the Player's Handbook are furthermore <b><i>short stories</i></b> written from the perspective of beings living in the world of Scath. They should give the players a better understanding of what it feels like to actually live in such a dangerous, dark land.
		<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>The second part: Gamemaster's Handbook</h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	DISCLAIMER: a lot of the great atmosphere and suspense in the world of Scath comes from the players and their characters not knowing what lies ahead and what happened in the past. Many of these secrets are unveiled in the Gamemaster's Handbook and players should not take too close a look into its pages.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>
			""<b><i>History of the land</i></b>"", an in – depth look at the creation of the world of Scath and all the things that happened up to this point in history.
		</li>
<li>
			A detailed ""<b><i>World Map</i></b>"" which includes descriptions of many important settlements and sites.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Creating the world of Scath</i></b>"" GM tips, plot hooks and campaign elements.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Societies of the Pale Ones and the Servants of Fire</i></b>""
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Elemental Powers</i></b>"" including further rules for magic and its use, creation of magical weapons, rules for ascendence (a secondary system of gaining experience) and a deeper look at the Eight and their plans.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Masters to darkness</i></b>"" – the dark machinations of the Fomori, their powers and greatest beings.
		</li>
<li>
<b>""<i>Creatures and Warriors""</i></b>– over 30 opponents/potential allies.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Famous Characters</i></b>"" (ca. 10) for use in the campaign.
		</li>
<li>
			""<b><i>Mass Combat rules</i></b>""will give you rules for fighting large battles, with hundreds or even thousands of warriors on both sides.<br/><br/>

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	No book is written in a vacuum. The world of Scath is a conglomeration of ideas inspired by the works of many great authors and ancient legends alike.<br/>
	The main influence is, of course, the mythology of the ancient Celts, especially the Irish ones. There are other, more modern books that use the same themes, and that have inspired me in the same way: ""The Book Corum"" by Michael Moorcock and David Gemmell's four ""Rigante"" novels.<br/>
	Other influences from contemporary fantasy are Steven Erikson's ""Mazalan books of the Fallen"" (my absolute favourite books of all time) and Brandon Sanderson's ""Mistborn"" trilogy, which inspired some of the atmosphere of Scath.<br/>
	In addition Josef Campbell's ""Hero with a thousand faces"" was a great inspiration for writing about the journey of classical, old school heroes.<br/><br/>
	
	When it comes to rules I was mostly inspired by two different gaming systems. The first one is the well known D20 rule system used by ""Pathfinder"" and different versions of ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"". The other gaming system is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition of ""Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying"", combined with some elements from the fairly similar ""Dark Heresy"".

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	1100 € = <b>""Careers for Humans"":</b> For those who want to experience the world of Scath from its <b><i>truly dark side</i></b>, with no mystical powers to protect them, <b><i>rules</i></b> for playing ordinary mortals will be added, including the three human archetypes ""Warrior"", ""Huntsman"" and ""Seeker of Knowledge"". 
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	1500 € = <b>""The Valley of Tears""</b>, a sandbox – setting detailing on approximately thirty to forty pages an area that can be used to start a campaign, including three villages, a larger city and several Overlords and their plans and servants.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	3500 € = <b>""Fully illustrated book""</b>: The Rulebook will have some illustrations, but to be able to deliver an even higher quality of detailed artworks we need more funding. If this stretchgoal is reached there will be additional ""general"" artwork scattered throughout the whole rulebook, but more importantly, we will be able to provide illustrations for nearly every single creature in the ""Creatures and Warriors"" section.

	As I am writing this the Player's Handbook is about 90% done. The Gamemaster's Handbook is about 20% done.<br/>
	I will continue writing while this campaign is running on Indiegogo. By the end of June the Player's Handbook will be done.<br/>
	During July and the first two weeks of August I will be able to write most of the Gamemaster's Handbook. The rest of August will be spent tidying up the book and doing the layout.<br/>
	Approximately in the second or third week of September the PDF version of Scath: Shadow of the Fomori, will be done and distributed amongst all backers.<br/>
	October will be the month of printing and shipping. Depending on where in the world you live you will most likely receive your softcover or hardcover copy in mid or late October.
</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	There are not too many risks involved in this project. Most of the illustrations are done and writing is well underway. By the time you are reading this (June 2015) the book will be approximately halfway finished.<br/>If something happens to me the book might be delayed, but it will definitely be
	finished and shipped to your home by the end of 2015.<br/>
	Should this campaign not reach its goal of 1000 Euro that would mean further delay until I can find some additional resources on my own. Even in that case all backers will receive their copy of the book not later than Spring 2016.

<b>Shipping details</b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
			Shipping will be done by our partners at Drivethrurpg.com. Depending on the part of the world you come from and whether you want a softcover or the (heavier) hardcover version of the book the shipping price will go up and down.<br/><br/>The average shipping prices for the following regions are:<br/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
			USA/Canada: Softcover 5 Euro, Hardcover 10 Euro<br/>
			Europe: Softcover 8 Euro, Hardcover 12 Euro<br/>
			Australia: Softcover 12 Euro, Hardcover 20 Euro<br/>
			Brazil: Softcover 25 Euro, Hardcover 30 Euro<br/><br/>
<b><i>Please add these prices to your pledge if you are bound to receive an actual book, no matter if softcover or hardcover!<br/><br/></i></b>

<li>
<b>Flexible funding and what it means</b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
			""Flexible funding"" means that you will get your copy of the book, even if the campaign itself does not reach 1000€. Should this happen, however, Indiegogo itself will be receiving a greater share of the money and I will also have to find additional funding myself, which will lead to a delay of several months. Even in this case every backer should have their book by spring 2016.<br/><br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>How does character creation work?</b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
			Character creation is explained in greater detail on our website <a href=""http://www.shadowofthefomori.net/character-creation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.<br/><br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>A closer look at combat</b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
			Battles are one of the main challenges the PCs will have to face in ""Scath:Shadow of the Fomori"". Combat is supposed to be fast – paced and dangerous, but at the same time allowing the players to use different strategies while battling opponents, and specializing their tactics when facing enemies they have already faced before. This is what we have been aspiring to create with the combat rules of Scath.<br/><br/>
			The rules themselves are based on Action Points. Every character has a certain amount of Action Points per combat turn (two in the beginning, three or maybe even four at later levels), symbolizing his skill and decisiveness in a battle. He can use these points to do different kinds of combat actions. There are a dozen ""Basic Actions"" that every character, no matter how unused to battle, can attempt (download a <a href=""http://www.shadowofthefomori.net/downloads/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Guide to Basic Combat Actions</a>). In addition to that (and in addition to the different kinds of magic Chosen Ones can wield) there are about twenty ""Advanced Actions"", that only fighters experienced in one of the five <a href=""http://www.shadowofthefomori.net/combat-styles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Combat Styles"" </a> can attempt to perform. Thus low level characters will have the opportunity to get to know the basic combat rules and then mix it up with some more complicated, and potentially more devastating attacks/actions.<br/>With this kind of combat system we have tried to encourage players to try out different kinds of attacks (feint, stunning strikes, disarming attacks, attacks that sacrifice defensive capabilities to deal more damage and vice versa etc.) in combat, instead of simply using the same kind of attack every turn. This should also enable both GMs and players alike to attempt a more narrative style of combat without having to put in too much extra effort, because the combat actions a PC has taken by itself tells most of the story.

<b>Magic in the world of Scath</b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
			Magic in the world of Scath is a powerful thing, allowing its wielders to shape the world to their will. At least eleven different kinds of magic, different ""lores"", if you so will, can be found in the Core Rulebook of Scath.<br/>
			The first eight of these lores of magic are the elemental powers, mystical abilities that were gifted to a Chosen One. Some of them are very different from each other, while others might be close regarding the effect the magic causes, if not its origin.<br/>
			In addition to that there will be three lores in the Gamemaster part of the Core Rulebook: the mysterious <b>Lore of Stars</b>, used by the nearly disappeared brotherhood of sorcerors and by the so – called ""Pale Ones"", the sinister, destructive <b>Lore of the Fomori</b>, used by the Overlords and their servants, and the <b>Lore of Nature</b>, primarily used by shamans, druids and some supernatural creatures.<br/> <br/>
			The rules for magic are fairly simple. Every spell has a ""Spirit Level"". To cast it successfully, the Chosen One must at least reach that Spirit Level. He can use his ""Spirit Dice"" to do that. These are simple D6 that are rolled and added together. Chosen Ones can use up to five spirit dice, boosting their chances to reach a spells Spirit Level, but the more dice they roll the more danger they are in to deplete their own spiritual energy, or even lose control of the magic, with unfortunate effects on themselves and their surroundings.<br/>
			Thus players can influence the amount of power their characters want to put into a spell, carefully choosing between potential risk and potential reward.

""This is a world of men no longer""


The lands of Scath, your home, are broken.
		Once there were three great kingdoms.
		Now only ashes and ruins remain.
		Evil rules the nights. The Fomori own the world.
		To them, man is just another animal to be hunted,
		enslaved or corrupted.
		The spirit of men is shattered. They cover behind flimsy walls or roam the wilderness in small, primitive packs.
		No one dares to oppose the Fomori.
		Until now.






	The ancient elemental spirits have simply watched as the dark legions hunted
	humanity to the brink of extinction. Now the Fomori are threatening the very
	life of the world itself, and the spirits can watch no longer.
	You were born into a world of fear and death, of inhuman powers and terrifying
	monsters. You have fought starvation, the cold of winter and sinister creatures
	alike. You have watched friends and family members die or be taken.
	Now the time has come to fight back. The spirits have given you strength. They
	have given you magic. Rise and challenge the rulers of the world! Destroy the
	Shadow of the Fomori!




The Setting:


	At the very core of this game stands the idea of a dark fantasy world ruled by ancient, mysterious powers.
	It is a world where mankind is dying, struggling for survival against both natural dangers and supernatural monsters that roam the wilderness. Travelling is deadly, thus most people live and die within a few miles from the place of their birth.
	The player characters are men and women lifted from these harsh, deadly lives by the Eight, ancient elemental spirits. They have taken a small part of such a
	spirit into themselves and received both physical and magical power.
	Armed with this power and the will of the Eight behind them, these warriors, these ""Chosen Ones"", will lift the broken spirit of humanity, unite the scattered clans and villages under one banner and challenge the dark powers that have ruled Scath for over two hundred years. They are the only ones who can save the world...and maybe rule it?


Classical Origins:


	""Shadow of the Fomori"" in many ways goes back to the ancient stories of classical heroes that we humans have told each other around the campfires, borrowing heavily from mythological lore, especially the Celtic one. It is a game where players will experience carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, being the only thing standing between the last remnants of humanity and the cold sleep of death.


The Journey:


	During their rise to power the Chosen will battle both natural and supernatural dangers. They will explore a land largely unknown, encountering many terrifying creatures. They will realize that the world of Scath is far older than they have been told, and that the only way to win this war they are fighting in, is to uncover the secrets of that forgotten past, a time long before the rise of humanity.
	In their journey the player characters will meet wondrous, ancient beings with their own agendas and will, depending on their choices, turn them into trusted allies or bitter enemies. The Chosen will bring their people the first victories in over two hundred years and will use them to rekindle the spirits of hope and resistance within the heart of mankind.
	During all that time the heroes will experience changes within their own bodies and minds. The influence of the Eight is strong, so strong that it might wipe away the humanity within a Chosen himself. Will the player characters be prepared to sever the ties with their friends and family, sacrificing their  body and soul and call it a small price to pay? Or will they hold on to what makes them mortal, struggling to unite the spiritual powers with their own humanity?





	""Scath – Shadow of the Fomori"" uses a D20 based rule system with many elements that will be familiar to experienced roleplayers.
	The aim of the system is to provide a core of fairly simple rules while enabling players and GM's alike to add more complicated, in – depth rules to their own liking, thus giving the characters far more options and hopefully making the game more enjoyable.
	The combat rules are one of the main focuses of the game, providing five distinct combat styles with over 30 different combat actions. Tied into that – but also very much usable out of combat – are the magic rules, including the eight elemental lores the player characters can use, but also three distinctly different kinds of magic.
	The gamemaster section also includes rules for leading armies into battle against each other and resolving such conflicts without having to rely on improvisation or hour – long dice rolling.


For further Information about Setting and Rules see our website.





	This is a game for players who enjoy combat, exploration and leadership. The Chosen Ones will have to battle terrible monsters, explore the secrets of a past long forgotten and forge alliances with weird beings. They will also have to unite humanity under one banner and lead them into battle against the evil that has destroyed their forefathers.
	At the same time, there is also a lot of roleplaying involved. Scath is a world with a dark, mysterious atmosphere, and this atmosphere is very important for a campaign. The weight of the world lies upon the Chosen Ones, and many men have been destroyed by this weight.
	The player characters themselves are changing and might struggle to adapt to their new natures. Lastly the efforts of unification and alliances provides great chances for roleplaying too: do the player characters want to be tyrants, leading by intimidation and fear, or will they be golden heroes in a world of
	darkness and blood? Will they want to keep all power in their hands, or will they risk giving it away to other, more ""human"" leaders? And how will they react to all the weird characters and alien beings they might encounter, and who might prove either ally or enemy? Only the players can find the answers
	to these questions.
	Ultimately it is your own decision on which of these elements your RPG group will focus. My belief is that ""Scath"" can be a very enjoyable experience for both groups who want to focus mostly on combat and exploring old ruins and groups whose main interest is in roleplaying and leading large forces or any other combination of the elements mentioned.





	Several unusual elements can be found in this setting. Together they make playing in the world of Scath a unique experience for players and gamemasters alike.



		Scath is heavily inspired by Celtic mythology, a body of ancient stories and legends that are fairly unknown to most people and are not used as much as they would deserve. Combined with them is a dark fantasy end-times setting, with a whole world on the brink of destruction.
	


		Mankind's technology in the lands of Scath is on a very low level. Most Wilder clans and some of the more primitive villages have been cast back into the stone age, relying on tools of bone, wood and stone. Whilst there might be a few artefacts of iron to be found here and there no one has the ability to create or repair it, and the highest standard of technology left is bronze.



		Most knowledge about the past has been lost in the great war. Even the lands themselves are mostly unknown, roamed by monsters. Very few men dare to venture far from the territory around their villages or camps. The player characters will be able to explore a whole world, never knowing what might wait behind the next hill. The players and their characters will both start with next to no information about Scath, thus making metagaming and mixing in/out of character knowledge nearly impossible. This journey of discovery, of finding information about the world, its history and its inhabitants, is one of the most interesting things about Scath.
	


		Scath as a roleplaying game returns to the classical beginnings of heroic tales. The player characters are classical heroes, amongst the very few Chosen Ones that stand between mankind and its utter destruction. The weight of the whole world is on their shoulders.
	











or: ""What you are getting for your money""


	With your help the world of Scath will be able to come to life in a book of approximately 250 pages. It will be held almost exclusively in shades of white, grey and black to reflect the bleak, dark atmosphere of the world.


	The book itself will be divided into two large sections. Below you will find a list of contents for both of these sections (subject to minor changes).

The first part: Player's Handbook



			""Dead and alive"" is a short story showing an outcast's ascension to power.
		

			""Introduction: Welcome to a world of Shadow"" will talk about the reasons for creating Scath, the atmosphere and main elements of the setting.
		

			""Living in a land of fear"" describes what little of history is known to men and talks in detail about the two societies of mankind: Villagers and Wilders.
		

			""Ancient powers awaken"" gives the players background information about the Eight, powerful elemental spirits that give them their abilities and one of which will become closely connected to each and every player character.
		

			""Heroes in a dark land"" gives players everything they need to know about character creation and the many paths they can chose to become the hero they truly want to be.
		

			""How to be a hero"" explains all general rules, giving descriptions of main attributes, skills and feats.
		

			""Fields of Blood and Bronze"" talks about rules for combat, including the five distinct combat styles two of which each Chosen can learn during his journey.
		

			""Forces of the world beyond"" explains how magic works in the Scath: Shadow of the Fomori. It also describes in great detail the eight elemental lores which player characters can choose from, including over a hundred different spells and hints on using them both in and out of combat.
		

			""Tools of Trade"" This final chapter of the player's handbook talks about barter trade and general equipment. It also describes different kinds of weapons and armour both PCs and NPCs can use.
		

			Scattered throughout the Player's Handbook are furthermore short stories written from the perspective of beings living in the world of Scath. They should give the players a better understanding of what it feels like to actually live in such a dangerous, dark land.
		


The second part: Gamemaster's Handbook

	DISCLAIMER: a lot of the great atmosphere and suspense in the world of Scath comes from the players and their characters not knowing what lies ahead and what happened in the past. Many of these secrets are unveiled in the Gamemaster's Handbook and players should not take too close a look into its pages.




			""History of the land"", an in – depth look at the creation of the world of Scath and all the things that happened up to this point in history.
		

			A detailed ""World Map"" which includes descriptions of many important settlements and sites.
		

			""Creating the world of Scath"" GM tips, plot hooks and campaign elements.
		

			""Societies of the Pale Ones and the Servants of Fire""
		

			""Elemental Powers"" including further rules for magic and its use, creation of magical weapons, rules for ascendence (a secondary system of gaining experience) and a deeper look at the Eight and their plans.
		

			""Masters to darkness"" – the dark machinations of the Fomori, their powers and greatest beings.
		

""Creatures and Warriors""– over 30 opponents/potential allies.
		

			""Famous Characters"" (ca. 10) for use in the campaign.
		

			""Mass Combat rules""will give you rules for fighting large battles, with hundreds or even thousands of warriors on both sides.







	No book is written in a vacuum. The world of Scath is a conglomeration of ideas inspired by the works of many great authors and ancient legends alike.
	The main influence is, of course, the mythology of the ancient Celts, especially the Irish ones. There are other, more modern books that use the same themes, and that have inspired me in the same way: ""The Book Corum"" by Michael Moorcock and David Gemmell's four ""Rigante"" novels.
	Other influences from contemporary fantasy are Steven Erikson's ""Mazalan books of the Fallen"" (my absolute favourite books of all time) and Brandon Sanderson's ""Mistborn"" trilogy, which inspired some of the atmosphere of Scath.
	In addition Josef Campbell's ""Hero with a thousand faces"" was a great inspiration for writing about the journey of classical, old school heroes.
	
	When it comes to rules I was mostly inspired by two different gaming systems. The first one is the well known D20 rule system used by ""Pathfinder"" and different versions of ""Dungeons & Dragons"". The other gaming system is the 2nd Edition of ""Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying"", combined with some elements from the fairly similar ""Dark Heresy"".





	1100 € = ""Careers for Humans"": For those who want to experience the world of Scath from its truly dark side, with no mystical powers to protect them, rules for playing ordinary mortals will be added, including the three human archetypes ""Warrior"", ""Huntsman"" and ""Seeker of Knowledge"". 


	1500 € = ""The Valley of Tears"", a sandbox – setting detailing on approximately thirty to forty pages an area that can be used to start a campaign, including three villages, a larger city and several Overlords and their plans and servants.


	3500 € = ""Fully illustrated book"": The Rulebook will have some illustrations, but to be able to deliver an even higher quality of detailed artworks we need more funding. If this stretchgoal is reached there will be additional ""general"" artwork scattered throughout the whole rulebook, but more importantly, we will be able to provide illustrations for nearly every single creature in the ""Creatures and Warriors"" section. 





	As I am writing this the Player's Handbook is about 90% done. The Gamemaster's Handbook is about 20% done.
	I will continue writing while this campaign is running on Indiegogo. By the end of June the Player's Handbook will be done.
	During July and the first two weeks of August I will be able to write most of the Gamemaster's Handbook. The rest of August will be spent tidying up the book and doing the layout.
	Approximately in the second or third week of September the PDF version of Scath: Shadow of the Fomori, will be done and distributed amongst all backers.
	October will be the month of printing and shipping. Depending on where in the world you live you will most likely receive your softcover or hardcover copy in mid or late October.

Risks

	There are not too many risks involved in this project. Most of the illustrations are done and writing is well underway. By the time you are reading this (June 2015) the book will be approximately halfway finished.If something happens to me the book might be delayed, but it will definitely be
	finished and shipped to your home by the end of 2015.
	Should this campaign not reach its goal of 1000 Euro that would mean further delay until I can find some additional resources on my own. Even in that case all backers will receive their copy of the book not later than Spring 2016.






Shipping details

			Shipping will be done by our partners at Drivethrurpg.com. Depending on the part of the world you come from and whether you want a softcover or the (heavier) hardcover version of the book the shipping price will go up and down.The average shipping prices for the following regions are:


			USA/Canada: Softcover 5 Euro, Hardcover 10 Euro
			Europe: Softcover 8 Euro, Hardcover 12 Euro
			Australia: Softcover 12 Euro, Hardcover 20 Euro
			Brazil: Softcover 25 Euro, Hardcover 30 Euro
Please add these prices to your pledge if you are bound to receive an actual book, no matter if softcover or hardcover!



Flexible funding and what it means

			""Flexible funding"" means that you will get your copy of the book, even if the campaign itself does not reach 1000€. Should this happen, however, Indiegogo itself will be receiving a greater share of the money and I will also have to find additional funding myself, which will lead to a delay of several months. Even in this case every backer should have their book by spring 2016.



How does character creation work?

			Character creation is explained in greater detail on our website here.



A closer look at combat

			Battles are one of the main challenges the PCs will have to face in ""Scath:Shadow of the Fomori"". Combat is supposed to be fast – paced and dangerous, but at the same time allowing the players to use different strategies while battling opponents, and specializing their tactics when facing enemies they have already faced before. This is what we have been aspiring to create with the combat rules of Scath.
			The rules themselves are based on Action Points. Every character has a certain amount of Action Points per combat turn (two in the beginning, three or maybe even four at later levels), symbolizing his skill and decisiveness in a battle. He can use these points to do different kinds of combat actions. There are a dozen ""Basic Actions"" that every character, no matter how unused to battle, can attempt (download a Guide to Basic Combat Actions). In addition to that (and in addition to the different kinds of magic Chosen Ones can wield) there are about twenty ""Advanced Actions"", that only fighters experienced in one of the five ""Combat Styles""  can attempt to perform. Thus low level characters will have the opportunity to get to know the basic combat rules and then mix it up with some more complicated, and potentially more devastating attacks/actions.With this kind of combat system we have tried to encourage players to try out different kinds of attacks (feint, stunning strikes, disarming attacks, attacks that sacrifice defensive capabilities to deal more damage and vice versa etc.) in combat, instead of simply using the same kind of attack every turn. This should also enable both GMs and players alike to attempt a more narrative style of combat without having to put in too much extra effort, because the combat actions a PC has taken by itself tells most of the story. 
		


Magic in the world of Scath

			Magic in the world of Scath is a powerful thing, allowing its wielders to shape the world to their will. At least eleven different kinds of magic, different ""lores"", if you so will, can be found in the Core Rulebook of Scath.
			The first eight of these lores of magic are the elemental powers, mystical abilities that were gifted to a Chosen One. Some of them are very different from each other, while others might be close regarding the effect the magic causes, if not its origin.
			In addition to that there will be three lores in the Gamemaster part of the Core Rulebook: the mysterious Lore of Stars, used by the nearly disappeared brotherhood of sorcerors and by the so – called ""Pale Ones"", the sinister, destructive Lore of the Fomori, used by the Overlords and their servants, and the Lore of Nature, primarily used by shamans, druids and some supernatural creatures. 
			The rules for magic are fairly simple. Every spell has a ""Spirit Level"". To cast it successfully, the Chosen One must at least reach that Spirit Level. He can use his ""Spirit Dice"" to do that. These are simple D6 that are rolled and added together. Chosen Ones can use up to five spirit dice, boosting their chances to reach a spells Spirit Level, but the more dice they roll the more danger they are in to deplete their own spiritual energy, or even lose control of the magic, with unfortunate effects on themselves and their surroundings.
			Thus players can influence the amount of power their characters want to put into a spell, carefully choosing between potential risk and potential reward.

<i> </i>  Now historians, keepers of the past, can not give a definite answer to what happened then. This is what we know. The arms race between super power nations reached its peak. New weapons became more dreadful and horrifying than ever before. Large, powerful countries began to dictate their will to small nation-states; forcing them into military alliance or testing its latest weaponry achievements on their territory. Deadly fighting for territory and its resources reached a tipping point. Two major nuclear superpowers had pushed each other to the brink of assured mutual annihilation. The gnawing pressure and utter insanity slowly deteriorated the minds of the upper echelon of the military establishment and a preemptive nuclear strike was launched. This event caused a chain reaction. Nuclear lunches were spotted all over the world, there were no telling who is attacking whom.<br/>

requires a greater ratio of attacking to defending forces. <p></p>

</div></div>","It's an online first person RPG shooter, that is PLAYED in a REAL LIFE world by remotely controlling REAL VEHICLES, on a REAL life battlefield. An experience that was only possible in military research and in real live combat situations before this project. We have devoted hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to create demo version of the unique and exciting miniature apocalyptic battleground world, located inside our «top secret» warehouse.


  'MURICA 2050: REMOTE is a revolutionary PC/MAC/MOBILE GAME where you remotely control miniature vehicles equipped with cameras and weapons on a REAL interactive maps.

Each map actually exists in real life inside a «top secret» location

Remotely control vehicles in first person view on our battlefield with your PC (Windows and Linux)/MAC/TABLET/IPHONE/ANDROID

Play either as a Comrade Commie or a Freedom Fighter with your friends, set up ambushes, destroy parts of the map, eliminate the opposing team YOUR WAY

Accumulate freedom fries, burgers, and buckets of oil as Freedom Fighters or borsh, vodka, and balalaika as Comrade Commies


[Due to political instability in the region, currencies are subject to change]



   Now historians, keepers of the past, can not give a definite answer to what happened then. This is what we know. The arms race between super power nations reached its peak. New weapons became more dreadful and horrifying than ever before. Large, powerful countries began to dictate their will to small nation-states; forcing them into military alliance or testing its latest weaponry achievements on their territory. Deadly fighting for territory and its resources reached a tipping point. Two major nuclear superpowers had pushed each other to the brink of assured mutual annihilation. The gnawing pressure and utter insanity slowly deteriorated the minds of the upper echelon of the military establishment and a preemptive nuclear strike was launched. This event caused a chain reaction. Nuclear lunches were spotted all over the world, there were no telling who is attacking whom.






   Humanity hid in underground shelters, bunkers and tunnels, while quiet nuclear winter descended on Earth for decades. In the middle of the twenty-first century, as the radioactive dust settled, first reconnaissance mission was send up top. Recovered samples have shown that it will be extremely difficult for humans to survive on the surface. Nuclear blasts altered composition of the atmosphere and planets orbit, so there would be only few habitable zones for people on the face of the Earth now...   Warring tribes began their last stand fighting along century’s old ideological battles. Ruthless warlords quickly seized an opportunity to rebuild and reshape new society according to their dogmas.



  As a player of ‘MURICA 2050: REMOTE and a citizen of one of the habitable regions, you will have an opportunity to visit following buildings:


BANK - building where you can rent a safety deposit box to store your extra items and hard earned currency


RECYCLE CENTER - specialized facility that recycles all junk parts found by players. [Access by permit only]


FACTORY - main production building of the game. Manufactures  weapons and armor, equipment and special tools from resources using blueprints. [Also accepts found parts from players for small commission]


MECHANIC SHOP - building where you can purchase and mount new modifications on your vehicle






AUCTION HALL - trading grounds, where players can buy and sell different items


CITY HALL - main quest hub, where players can participate in salvage missions


ACADEMY - an institution that allows players to learn new profession and upgrade skills






LABORATORY - gain access to top secret patents and alien technology blueprints, also participate in exciting exploration missions


MILITARY HQ - building where you can get started on some of the combat missions


MERCENARY CAMP - recruit mercenaries into your crew


  Plant your banner and forge your empire in the world, by controlling everything in the region. From auction prices, bank interests rates and city hall taxes to mechanic modifications, recycling research and factory production. Command your army. Conquer neighboring regions and dominate in clan wars!!!


  Humanity left their refuge and came out of the bunker on the contaminated, but habitable land. In a situation where it was necessary to help each other, people once again engaged in the desperate war for resources and territory. All scrap metal has been utilized for the war efforts. Now, any piece of iron that is able to move becomes a ""war machine"".

Players are in control of an ""armed"" vehicle, equipped for search and rescue (PvE) or combat missions (PvP).






  Players, that are familiar with 3D modelling, will have an opportunity to customize ""car body” of their vehicle to the last little detail. And also sell their models to others.To prevent any miss understandings and ensure that both parties are satisfied, our team will act as a facilitator in every transaction.


  Weapons and ammunition of the world of 'MURICA are extremely diverse and plentiful. However, there are couple of main categories:



 All weapons require different types of ammunition. Most came before the war, others were invented after, using latest technology available. Now military funding and research is the only way to survive!!!
 At first, you will be required to complete military boot-camp campaign to familiarize yourself with game mechanics and unique combat settings. Then, you decide which direction your character will take. To survive players can learn and perfect their skills in four major professions. All of them packed with their own unique abilities, weapons and daily missions.






 Every map is a complicated maze with integrated hidden and reviled points of interest, for example: abandon warehouses for looting useful technology, supplies, weapons and ammunition; repair stations to restore some of that damaged armor; lookout towers that give you a broader view of the map; crossing bridges that you can destroy and trap your enemy; stationary defensive turret structures for extra armor and damage; land mines that can immobilize enemy vehicle; booby traps and other distractions that are perfect for setting up an ambush. Constructed by putting together combinations of 3D printed blocks.

Maps are grouped into three categories: Combat, Exploration, Championship. 
Join the fight at random, or pick your teammates and play as one squad.


Gladiator match. Twenty players, last one to survive wins.
Team death match. Ten verses ten. Eliminate enemy team. 
Hunting game. Search and destroy enemy vehicles in set time.




Gathering objective. Factory work orders.
Farming quests.
Delivery quests. Reach destination in set time. 
Race track missions with its own ranks and competitions.




Recreation of famous World War 2 tank battles. 
Alien invasion. Players group to destroy aliens which will be controlled by 'MURICA development team. 
Tournament. Champions mountain. Hundreds players, winner takes sizable cash prize.

Each category contains three different types of terrain: urban, mountains and rivers, radioactive woods.

 Combat conducted in urban areas such as towns and cities. Urban combat 
is very different from combat in the open at both operational and 
tactical level. The characteristics of an average city include tall 
buildings, narrow alleys, sewage tunnels and possibly a subway system.

<p>Being individual means at lot to us - because customizing your character adds a lot of variance and fun to the game. To achieve this we're putting in a couple of characters right away, plus according skins and accessories.</p>
<p>So we're already into creating additional playable characters and skins for them - and you can add more! Check our stretch goals for the added chars. And also settings - let us tell you more about these!</p>
<p>You could call these sceneries, environments, surroundings and the like. We call them settings internally. And we're starting with the cities' rooftops of rumptown - but we have a lot of possible other settings ready in our ideas.</p>
<p>How about rumping in space? Or in a cave? Or in a jungle? Each new setting will come with a lot of new graphics and mechanics. A cave surely has different traps than cities' rooftops - and so will every new setting.</p>
<p>Each new setting added, by your contributions in our stretch goals and by ourselves after the release, contains at least 30 new maps to go along with the new scenery. This is where you can lure your friends into new awesome traps and score better times on each map than anyone else ever did!</p>

<p>Like our name already says: We are dedicated to games in all its beauty. We play them, we talk about them, we make videos and now we are creating our own dream game.</p>
<p>We are a rather small team of 11 people in our company located in Hamburg, Germany, and there is no one who does not love games with their heart and soul. The big part of us have been working together for over the last 5 years. We know each other very well and that is one of the main reasons why we decided to create a standalone game.</p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248166/files/20150225072205-icon_rumpfi_pose_1_150x185.png?1424877725"" src="""" style=""margin: 0 15px 5px 0;""/> We proudly show off a big and long experience in gaming entertainment. We've been host on several shows at the yearly GamesCom fair in Cologne, including lots of daily shows on the Blizzard booth (especially StarCraft II) - entertaining the huge crowd that was present on each GamesCom fair. Five years and still counting - we'll be there this year as well.</p>
<p>We've been broadcasting innumerable shows on our Live-Stream, we've been producing countless VODs on many, many different games. We also organized and hosted an indescribable Live-Event with more than 700 people at the location - plus the hundreds of thousands of people watching the live stream of that event.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248178/files/20150225072755-icon_rumpfi_pose_2_150x180.png?1424878075"" src="""" style=""margin: 0 5px 5px 5px;""/> It is our chance to be part of the games industry, working on our dreams and leaving a small footprint on ""Planet Gaming"". Entertaining our friends and fans pushes us every day for quite a long time now. Seeing people play games and having fun while doing so is a real pleasure to us. That's why we want to create a game of our own. But we have to stay realistic. And that is the reason to ask for your support.</p>
<p>With your contribution, no matter how big or small it is, you are showing us that you believe in us. You say to us that you would like to have fun and see this game come to life. We really appreciate that and every Dollar gives us the chance to do something good, keep our company running and create the game we love - for ourselves, and especially, for you!</p>

<p>No doubt you've noticed that the sum we're looking for on our initial target - and especially the stretch goals - looks quite high. Believe it or not, this is actually cheap for a 3D jump and run game at this scope - and the only reason it's this cheap is because we're already deep into the development of the base physics and mechanics of this game.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1258005/files/20150301034452-icon_hook_150x216.png?1425210292"" src="""" style=""margin: 30px 0px 30px 10px;""/> More than half of your support is being used for the salaries of our team - to keep working in our office and making progress every day. The second chunk of all your payments sadly is going off in taxes and fees. Since we're a registered corporation, we'll have to pay 19% VAT (Value Added Tax) on any of your contributions, since they count as a straight income. Plus some fees for Indiegogo, PayPal and currency conversion (eventuall we'll need those USD in EUR), we're close to 30% for these dues in total. With the remaining money we're paying the monthly fees on software licenses and the like, which are pretty much only required to create assets and things for the actual game development.</p>
<p>This is a flexible funding campaign, meaning that all your contributions are going right to our accounts and helping us in making this game even more awesome. As soon as the initial campaigns target is met, the fees on Indiegogo are being lowered – so we get even more time out of your support if we meet the first and main goal.</p>

<p>While we started creating ""RUMP!"" out of a quick idea we soon realised that this game has great potential to bring fun to the people. We came up with some really cool ideas, features and settings - but there was one thing we didn't have: Time!</p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248119/files/20150225070408-icon_rumpfi_pose_3_150x245.png?1424876648"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px 15px 5px 0;""/> As a small company, we people try to live from what we are doing. So we could either bring a very early version of RUMP! on the market and sell it on Steam as an ""Early Access Game"" - which would be clearly the wrong decision for our understanding and vision - or we could go the hard way and say: We need money - to buy us more time!</p>
<p>It ain't easy for us to go and ask you people for a funding for a game that ain't finished yet. But since the game is already in a playable state we could easily launch an early access program and sell the current state of the game.</p>
<p>But we don't want to do that. We want a really publishable state of RUMP! and so we need some more time to get things finished and polished.<br/><br/>We would like to invest more work into developing RUMP! and creating the environment, bring features and gameplay to perfection and making our job good. For this we need licenses for different kinds of software, funds for hardware and equipment, and even more menpower (like an animation specialist, which could speed up things a bit). We need to pay our bills for rent and our people working on the game.</p>
<p>We're all working hard to achieve the things we would like to - but at some point, after a 20 hour day, you need some money to live and get your head free. Having panics like ""Where will I be next month"" is a feeling we REALLY don't need and none of our teammates deserve. And here you come into play by contributing to this awesome game and our vision.</p>
<p><a href=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1257904/files/20150301024718-2015-02-28_06.jpg?1425206838"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1257905/files/20150301024722-2015-02-28_06_620.jpg?1425206842"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>

<p>In case we're going over the top of our initial target, we do have a plan for the future development and more features in the game.</p>
<p>On a sidenote: we're also thinking about an ingame level editor, so everyone can create their own maps and circuits. This is not planned for the final release, but maybe at a later point. We're just pointing out that we do think about such things and we believe that community created maps would be really awesome to play!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1256165/files/20150228094117-risks_and_challenges.jpg?1425145277"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We really do have a good starting position. One of our main fears was to not get Steam's Greenlight in a decent time. Some parts of our development rely on Steams ""SteamWorks API"" and we only would get access to it if we were able to get ""the green light"". But we were wrong: within only 6 days you, our fans and friends, pushed our game through greenlight! That was amazing and a very big step for us.<br/></p>
<p>Aside of these we're really solid:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can we get a shippable state of the game (and not pulling a DayZ)?</b></p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248203/files/20150225073822-icon_rumpfi_head_4_150x203.png?1424878702"" src="""" style=""margin: 0 15px 5px 0;""/> Yes, since we are actually playing it every day in our office while testing changes. The core game itself is pretty much complete - but not to the extent and range we are wishing it to be. More levels, more skins, more gadgets. Basic functions are implemented quickly - but it's the fine tuning that gets them to feel right and create the fun in the game. We need some more time to get this to where we're looking to go for.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Are your development basics safe and stable?</b></p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1247812/files/20150225041928-logo_unrealengine_150x166.png?1424866768"" src="""" style=""margin: 0 15px 5px 0;""/> Yes, as we currently are not using (or depending on) any trial or unstable software. Our assets are being created in solid applications like Photoshop and 3ds Max - and for the game we're really happy with the Unreal Engine 4, as it fields awesome performance and usability. The EPIC team is pushing out updates and improvements regularly, but we can also launch specific parts in a previous engine versions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Is there a platform to distribute our game?</b><br/></p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1247808/files/20150225041853-logo_steam_150x150.png?1424866733"" src="""" style=""margin: 0 15px 5px 0;""/> Yes, since that honorable swarm of users already got us Greenlight on Steam. But we're looking beyond PC-gaming and Steam. We'd really like to release a port for any Unix / Linux Platform, a port for any Apple / Mac user and finally also a version for PlayStation and XBOX users.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Do we have the needed skillset to build our game?</b></p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248205/files/20150225073829-icon_rumpfi_head_2_150x203.png?1424878709"" src="""" style=""margin: 0 15px 5px 0;""/> Yes, since we are already building and updating it every day as of now. The game is already in a playable state - but we want it to be better. More humourous and sinuous animations of our characters are asking for an animation specialist. So this is more of a bonus. Our characters work and they are already hilarous - but when an animation specialist comes into play, that may become even more entertaining.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Will this game really be fun?</b></p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1248206/files/20150225073833-icon_rumpfi_head_1_150x203.png?1424878713"" src="""" style=""margin: 0 15px 5px 0;""/> That is up to you! Play the public demo (tutorial + 1-2 levels, will be released soon), look at our videos or check out the screenshots! Fun is up to each individual - but since our setting, of playing a character with no arms and legs, is already quite humorous, we think that pretty much everyone will have lots of it. Especially once you got hooked by the multiplayer. Play it with your friends and you'll probably spend a decent amount of time jumping and rumping around.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We're currently planning to release the final version of RUMP! around October / November 2015.</p>
<p><b>We think we do have it all. But it's you to decide!</b></p>

<p>This is a question where myths are told and even the ancient greek were asking this question. Some say Rumper lost his arms and legs while sneezing. Some say them idiots are unable to animate limbs properly... and even other say: You know, because things and stuff. For reasons!</p>

Being individual means at lot to us - because customizing your character adds a lot of variance and fun to the game. To achieve this we're putting in a couple of characters right away, plus according skins and accessories.
So we're already into creating additional playable characters and skins for them - and you can add more! Check our stretch goals for the added chars. And also settings - let us tell you more about these!
You could call these sceneries, environments, surroundings and the like. We call them settings internally. And we're starting with the cities' rooftops of rumptown - but we have a lot of possible other settings ready in our ideas.
How about rumping in space? Or in a cave? Or in a jungle? Each new setting will come with a lot of new graphics and mechanics. A cave surely has different traps than cities' rooftops - and so will every new setting.
Each new setting added, by your contributions in our stretch goals and by ourselves after the release, contains at least 30 new maps to go along with the new scenery. This is where you can lure your friends into new awesome traps and score better times on each map than anyone else ever did!



We want to thank our backers by giving them some unique and rare perks. It is only $20 to get the game itself - but you can back us more. Each new tier comes with one or two new goodies for you. This goes up to a real 333 Gold Coin and a day off with our team at the ""Heide Park"" theme park here in Germany.

Like our name already says: We are dedicated to games in all its beauty. We play them, we talk about them, we make videos and now we are creating our own dream game.
We are a rather small team of 11 people in our company located in Hamburg, Germany, and there is no one who does not love games with their heart and soul. The big part of us have been working together for over the last 5 years. We know each other very well and that is one of the main reasons why we decided to create a standalone game.
 We proudly show off a big and long experience in gaming entertainment. We've been host on several shows at the yearly GamesCom fair in Cologne, including lots of daily shows on the Blizzard booth (especially StarCraft II) - entertaining the huge crowd that was present on each GamesCom fair. Five years and still counting - we'll be there this year as well.
We've been broadcasting innumerable shows on our Live-Stream, we've been producing countless VODs on many, many different games. We also organized and hosted an indescribable Live-Event with more than 700 people at the location - plus the hundreds of thousands of people watching the live stream of that event.
 It is our chance to be part of the games industry, working on our dreams and leaving a small footprint on ""Planet Gaming"". Entertaining our friends and fans pushes us every day for quite a long time now. Seeing people play games and having fun while doing so is a real pleasure to us. That's why we want to create a game of our own. But we have to stay realistic. And that is the reason to ask for your support.
With your contribution, no matter how big or small it is, you are showing us that you believe in us. You say to us that you would like to have fun and see this game come to life. We really appreciate that and every Dollar gives us the chance to do something good, keep our company running and create the game we love - for ourselves, and especially, for you!



No doubt you've noticed that the sum we're looking for on our initial target - and especially the stretch goals - looks quite high. Believe it or not, this is actually cheap for a 3D jump and run game at this scope - and the only reason it's this cheap is because we're already deep into the development of the base physics and mechanics of this game.
 More than half of your support is being used for the salaries of our team - to keep working in our office and making progress every day. The second chunk of all your payments sadly is going off in taxes and fees. Since we're a registered corporation, we'll have to pay 19% VAT (Value Added Tax) on any of your contributions, since they count as a straight income. Plus some fees for Indiegogo, PayPal and currency conversion (eventuall we'll need those USD in EUR), we're close to 30% for these dues in total. With the remaining money we're paying the monthly fees on software licenses and the like, which are pretty much only required to create assets and things for the actual game development.
This is a flexible funding campaign, meaning that all your contributions are going right to our accounts and helping us in making this game even more awesome. As soon as the initial campaigns target is met, the fees on Indiegogo are being lowered – so we get even more time out of your support if we meet the first and main goal.



While we started creating ""RUMP!"" out of a quick idea we soon realised that this game has great potential to bring fun to the people. We came up with some really cool ideas, features and settings - but there was one thing we didn't have: Time!
 As a small company, we people try to live from what we are doing. So we could either bring a very early version of RUMP! on the market and sell it on Steam as an ""Early Access Game"" - which would be clearly the wrong decision for our understanding and vision - or we could go the hard way and say: We need money - to buy us more time!
It ain't easy for us to go and ask you people for a funding for a game that ain't finished yet. But since the game is already in a playable state we could easily launch an early access program and sell the current state of the game.
But we don't want to do that. We want a really publishable state of RUMP! and so we need some more time to get things finished and polished.We would like to invest more work into developing RUMP! and creating the environment, bring features and gameplay to perfection and making our job good. For this we need licenses for different kinds of software, funds for hardware and equipment, and even more menpower (like an animation specialist, which could speed up things a bit). We need to pay our bills for rent and our people working on the game.
We're all working hard to achieve the things we would like to - but at some point, after a 20 hour day, you need some money to live and get your head free. Having panics like ""Where will I be next month"" is a feeling we REALLY don't need and none of our teammates deserve. And here you come into play by contributing to this awesome game and our vision.



In case we're going over the top of our initial target, we do have a plan for the future development and more features in the game.
On a sidenote: we're also thinking about an ingame level editor, so everyone can create their own maps and circuits. This is not planned for the final release, but maybe at a later point. We're just pointing out that we do think about such things and we believe that community created maps would be really awesome to play!


We really do have a good starting position. One of our main fears was to not get Steam's Greenlight in a decent time. Some parts of our development rely on Steams ""SteamWorks API"" and we only would get access to it if we were able to get ""the green light"". But we were wrong: within only 6 days you, our fans and friends, pushed our game through greenlight! That was amazing and a very big step for us.
Aside of these we're really solid:

Can we get a shippable state of the game (and not pulling a DayZ)?
 Yes, since we are actually playing it every day in our office while testing changes. The core game itself is pretty much complete - but not to the extent and range we are wishing it to be. More levels, more skins, more gadgets. Basic functions are implemented quickly - but it's the fine tuning that gets them to feel right and create the fun in the game. We need some more time to get this to where we're looking to go for.

Are your development basics safe and stable?
 Yes, as we currently are not using (or depending on) any trial or unstable software. Our assets are being created in solid applications like Photoshop and 3ds Max - and for the game we're really happy with the Unreal Engine 4, as it fields awesome performance and usability. The EPIC team is pushing out updates and improvements regularly, but we can also launch specific parts in a previous engine versions.

Is there a platform to distribute our game?
 Yes, since that honorable swarm of users already got us Greenlight on Steam. But we're looking beyond PC-gaming and Steam. We'd really like to release a port for any Unix / Linux Platform, a port for any Apple / Mac user and finally also a version for PlayStation and XBOX users.

Do we have the needed skillset to build our game?
 Yes, since we are already building and updating it every day as of now. The game is already in a playable state - but we want it to be better. More humourous and sinuous animations of our characters are asking for an animation specialist. So this is more of a bonus. Our characters work and they are already hilarous - but when an animation specialist comes into play, that may become even more entertaining.

Will this game really be fun?
 That is up to you! Play the public demo (tutorial + 1-2 levels, will be released soon), look at our videos or check out the screenshots! Fun is up to each individual - but since our setting, of playing a character with no arms and legs, is already quite humorous, we think that pretty much everyone will have lots of it. Especially once you got hooked by the multiplayer. Play it with your friends and you'll probably spend a decent amount of time jumping and rumping around.

We're currently planning to release the final version of RUMP! around October / November 2015.
We think we do have it all. But it's you to decide!



Are you a modern company and can relate yourself to gaming and games in general? Are you looking for creative advertising space? Then you should read up on our ingame Billboards!

Saying ""Billboards"" we do not only mean the big billboards themselves, but also ad spaces, decals, banners, flags and several other spots, where smaller variations of a big billboard or even just the according logo might be placed on a flag.
We want them to look like they've been fully made for this game and chime along with the environment. They shall not disturb or distract the players - but be fun to look at. Please ask for our samples and we'll also be happy to help you on finding the right style, if you'd like to participate but haven't been into ingame ads yet.

Almost every turn, players will be fighting for states, spending campaign dollars to influence elections or mudslinging opponents and playing action cards against others at the most inopportune times. <br/><br/>
<p><b>Not to mention, all players can negotiate with other players at any time</b>. This is important when folks want to gang up on others or swing devious deals to set the advantage in their corner... and just like politicians, no player is bound to fulfill any promises they make. You're playing against real people though. Burn too many bridges, and it may be your last.<br/></p>
<p>Unlike many other card and board games, any player can actively engage with others during anyone's turn. Whether it's to help someone, sling mud or negotiate with others at the table, there isn't any ""waiting for someone to finish"" to keep things moving. Mudslinger can be fast-paced and brutal at times. Abandon your generous nature at the door. This is politics. Things are going to get messy.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>
A Word of Warning
</h3>
<p><b>This game is recommended for adults</b>, as play can get very 
nasty (we really do mean that). Mudslinger allows players to 
openly backstab others, lie straight to their faces, and genuinely do 
some mean, hurtful things. It's hilarious, but grown-up hilarious.</p>
<p>On the surface, Mudslinger may seem a bit complex, but it is actually 
quite easy to learn, with each turn consisting of three very quick 
phases, and then passing to the next player. After a few rounds you'll 
have it down and will quickly begin developing strategies. After one 
game, you'll likely be developing long-term strategies for future games.
 The best players know when to be aggressive, defensive and cunning - 
and it's those people who win the most games.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div></div>","""Lie, cheat, steal and backstab your way to victory, on your quest to becoming the next President of the Unites States!""


Mudslinger consists of 6 candidate cards, 112 Mudslinger cards, 50 state cards and rules cards. Also, this is shown with the accessories of money chits and dice (we couldn't fit it all in the box!).
What is Mudslinger?

 Mudslinger is a highly competitive card-and-dice game where players will do whatever it take to become President.
Hilariously mean-spirited, Mudslinger is great fun for beginners and experienced players alike, but the more cut-throat one's strategy, the better the odds of winning. Prepare to wage war!


Mudslinger will bring out the best of the worst in people, as no deed is too low when it comes to running for President!








Almost every turn, players will be fighting for states, spending campaign dollars to influence elections or mudslinging opponents and playing action cards against others at the most inopportune times. 
Not to mention, all players can negotiate with other players at any time. This is important when folks want to gang up on others or swing devious deals to set the advantage in their corner... and just like politicians, no player is bound to fulfill any promises they make. You're playing against real people though. Burn too many bridges, and it may be your last.
Unlike many other card and board games, any player can actively engage with others during anyone's turn. Whether it's to help someone, sling mud or negotiate with others at the table, there isn't any ""waiting for someone to finish"" to keep things moving. Mudslinger can be fast-paced and brutal at times. Abandon your generous nature at the door. This is politics. Things are going to get messy.



Here's a quick snapshot of the new card design. Sorry about the glare!



But Politics is Boring!

Believe us when we say you DO NOT have to like politics to love this 
game. Of course, if you are a political junkie, more power to you - it's
 definitely up your alley, but if you just love competitive games that 
require cunning wit, solid strategy and some downright evil actions 
dropped on opponents every now and then, this is a must-have game 
for the collection.

was born!  We are here to rePURPOSE our
HEARTdrives with each other.  About 2
months after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Erik Lehmann,
father of three, had a powerful vision. 
He wanted to let kids know just how much they matter right now!  Upon looking around, he saw that our youth
are often told all the ways that they don’t matter.  They can’t work until age 14, drive until age
16, can’t vote until 18, and can’t drink alcohol until age 21.  Much of a child’s school day is spent
passively consuming the information and taking the tests that adults believe
they should take!  The Game Changer
Movement is here to encourage children to know that they have a choice to be
significant right now!  Tony Robbins, a
human behavior expert, considers significance; one of the six main drivers of
human behavior.  This is true at any age!</span><br/></p>
<p><b>What does it mean to rePURPOSE our HEARTdrives?</b></p>
<p>We are inspiring <b>1,000,000</b> youth to trade in at least <b>one violent video game.  </b>We
have developed a low tech robot whose sole mission is to collect the violent
video games in a community near you.  We
are going to transform and rePURPOSE the games that are collected from the
robots into art, furniture, signs, and other transformational expressions.  We will decommission the violent content and
create a new PURPOSE for the CDs, DVDs, and their cases.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We will travel the country,curating events and programs with
youth and their caregivers.  We are
designing a mobile living room that will be launched so that we can have real
conversations about how to <b>bring the
unit back to the family.  </b>The family
looks very different now than it has looked in the past, and with this new
look; comes new challenges and opportunities! We will create what we call <b>Conversation PEACES </b>as we talk <b>WITH </b>each other and create art, signs or
rePURPOSE furniture in each community on the national tour.  We are going to share perspectives with
families all across the country and eventually the world.  Our collective HEARTdrive will be rePURPOSEd
from a fear and scarcity based world to a love and abundance based world.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why are we focusing on violent video games in
this phase of the Game Changer Movement?</b></p>
<p>There is data indicating that both boys and
girls will play at least 10,000 hours of video games before they become 21 year
old men and women.  Currently 90% of the
popular video games contain violence at varying degrees…even games rated E10+.  This is the challenge and opportunity!  Malcolm Gladwell wrote about the magic of
spending 10,000 hours in pursuit of mastery in his book, Outliers.  If someone invested 10,000 hours into
something, they would likely come out a master at it!  With 90% of the games our kids play
containing violence, our kids are becoming masters at hurting and killing
instead of learning, growing, and loving. 
We, as parents, have an opportunity and perhaps even a responsibility to
help guide our kids towards applying more of those hours towards the common
good.  It is time for us all to change
our game, together! </p>
<p>Gaming is not going away any time
soon.  In fact, gaming is actually
becoming a major educational modality, because of the active learning and sense
of <b>significance </b>that is embedded in
the game or the mission.  There are many
ways to create a sense of significance, and violence is one of the easiest in a
way.  In a first person shooter game, the
first person becomes immediately significant when they have a gun in their hand
and they control whether or not someone else lives or dies.  Combine the sense of significance that
violence creates with true to life graphics, and we are reinforcing a sense of
significance that has no real-life corollary. 
This might be ok, if, after our kids played the games, we sat down with
them and had a conversation with them. 
The challenge with this is, we think we are too busy already, so we
don’t take the time to connect with our kids and have the crucial conversations
necessary to let our kids know how significant they truly are already.  We, as parents know that the best way to
reach our kids is to actually meet them where they are, and see them eye to
eye, on their level!  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439153923/y2bfv0pbhrgzizzfm8wu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This may mean that
we actually play video games with our kids and perhaps we can meet them in a
virtual world that has room for all members of the family, instead of having us
roll our eyes as the chasm between parents and their children widens by the
hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tony Robbins speaks about 6 key drivers of
human behavior and they are: Certainty, Variety, Significance, Connection,
Growth, and Contribution.  When we look
at the virtual video gaming world it is very interesting that the gaming world
might be getting progressively better at offering these drivers as compared to
our real lives.  In her book, Reality is
Broken, by Jane McGonigal, she points out that the gaming world allows gamers
to achieve a sense of accomplishment, community, significance, and maybe even
contribution!  </p>
<p><b>Is
it possible to redirect the 10,000 hours of gaming time towards solving real
world challenges?  Can we create
challenges that inspire 1,000,000 youth to trade in violent video games in the
first place?  What will inspire today’s
youth to change their game?</b></p>
<p>In her book “Peers Inc”, Robin Chase
discusses the concept of excess capacity as an exponential opportunity in the
world of business and social change. 
Imagine what the world will look like when kids and adults alike apply
the excess capacity of their entertainment hours and gaming hours?  What if the first million youth who traded in
a violent video game were given a challenge to solve in the game or virtual
world that had immediate real world application?  How significant would those kids feel?  How happy would their parents be?  What if there were a gaming platform that
parents wanted their kids to play, because it taught them all the things they
needed to learn in an environment that reached them where they were already
looking?  Would there be as much ADD and
ADHD?  What would an educational
system  look like if it were augmented in
a symbiotic relationship with gaming platforms that complemented and reinforced
the subjects that were discussed during the school day?  </p>
<p>I am inspired about redirecting a good
portion of the 10,000 hours that youth spend playing video games towards games
that matter in the real world!  In 2007,
I read the book “The Power of Focus” by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, and
Les Hewitt.  In that book there was a
recommendation to take an hour a day from unproductive time and invest it into
a new pursuit.  When I read this, I
decided to take an hour from TV and start running for at least an hour a day.  By July of 2008, I crossed the finish line of
a 15K, or 9.3 mile road race called the Boiler Maker Race in Utica, NY.  By November 2010, I crossed the finish line
of the New York City Marathon, and I have run the Honolulu Marathon twice since
then.  I share this because I learned
what becomes possible when time is redirected from something unproductive and
invested in something growth oriented. 
All this happened by redirecting just one hour a day.  What would the world look like if 1,000,000
youth redirected their gaming hours from non-productive and violent gaming and
reinvested them into pro-social games that addressed real-life community or
societal challenges?  </p>
<p>Elan Musk, who co-founded Paypal, founded
Space X and Tesla, was in a conversation with Sal Khan, founder of the Khan
Academy about education and Elan recommended that he gamify education as much
as possible.  This is a great opportunity
for collaboration with schools, organizations, municipalities, and
corporations.  One way to create a sense
of significance is to search out real world challenges that can be brought into
the classroom environment.  Gamifying
also provides for an opportunity to learn how to fail gracefully and hopefully
faster.  Failure is what Elan Musk was
willing to do three times while developing Space X and his first three launches
failed before the forth succeeded and then Space X was granted an almost $2
Billion contract. Failure comprises 70% of the gaming world, and many
successful entrepreneurs attribute their largest successes to learning how to
get up after failure.  On the flip side
of failure, games allow for learning towards mastery with failure as a
necessary part of the process.</p>
<p>To make the story way more personal, I feel
compelled to share about some memories from the time I spent about 50 days
living in a homeless shelter for youth as a high school senior.  I was really lucky because the shelter was
located in the same school district where I was enrolled, so I did not miss any
school on account of my temporary homelessness. 
That said, all the other youth at the shelter were not as
fortunate.  The shelter offered tutoring
to the other youth; however, the tutors were not very consistent and then the
video games that were available were very violent in nature, and there were no
conversations about making such choices of how to spend our time.  I have visited youth shelters over the past
few years and the video game options in shelters are getting progressively more
violent.  Imagine if there was an
alternative available to these kids! 
These kids are some of the most resourceful people I have ever known in
my entire life!  I am so looking forward
to helping these youth to redirect their time allocation choices.  These kids, who have been invisible, to so
many, may, in fact make a huge contribution to this planet.  I believe in these kids, because I was one of

When you join the Game Changer Movement as a member with a contribution of at least $10; you will be building a community of conscious parents who are courageously Changing OUR Game together!  We are creating collaborative processes that allow parents and youth to come together to create the next wave of meaningful and exciting gaming.  We are creating a platform that Realifies the Game World and Gamifies the Real World!  We look forward to building this community together!
For every $10 you contribute, we promise to inspire one child to trade in at least one violent video game that we will transform into art, furniture, signs and maybe even dresses!



Our Kids Won't Care How Much we Know, Until They Know How Much We Care!What is the Game Changer Movement you ask, and how is this all going to work?

We will inspire 1,000,000 youth to trade in at least one violent video game.

We have launched a Virtual Living Room with the Game Changer Movement where at least once a week, we initiate a conversation with fellow Game Changers, parents and youth.  This is currently hosted in Google Hangouts.  We are aiming towards Mondays at 3:30 p.m. EST as the definite weekly time.  We will have a topic for the week and people can feel free to post and add to the discussion on the Game Changer Movement page on Facebook at www.facebook.com/gamechangersexperience. 

We will deploy robots 
whose sole mission is to collect violent video games all across the country at schools, YMCAs, movie theatres, sports arenas, and other venues where children are likely to frequent.  We are also engaging in conversations with potential strategic partners who might be willing to contribute their “excess capacity” to help us gather the games nationwide.  It will cost approximately $2500 for us to deploy a robot to a community near you!  If you are interested in this opportunity, please reach out and let us know by posting a comment and selecting the $2500 perk on the side!  It would be great to create a custom sponsorship experience for your family, business, school or organization.


Each youth who trades in a violent video game will receive gifts from our supporters and sponsors and they will be given VIP access to the “Game Changer Game Platform”  We are developing a mission suitable for the courageous youth who are willing to change their game!  This platform will Gamify the Real World and Realify the Game or Virtual World.  This will be a values driven platform and we are going to co-create it with the stakeholders including the first youth who courageously trade in a game.  This is going to be a work in progress as the Game Changer Movement unfolds.                                                            

The first 100 youth who courageously trade in at least one violent video game, will be invited into a special creation session, so they can have direct input in the game platform we create for them.
Once 1 million youth are pre-registered by trading in a violent video game, we will announce details about the surprise we have for in store for them.  The Game Changer Game Platform is in early stage development.  This will be a values driven Platform there will be a cap on both hours per day and hours per week that the game can be played in the virtual world.  There will be no cap on the hours in the carbon based world!  We also know that the Platform will only permit pro-social games to be played within the system.

We are asking parents to record and post themselves taking, what we call, the Game Changer Pledge.  This is a promise to spend at least 2 more hours each week with their children.  We have created a starter list of 20 recommendations for how parents might spend that time.  We would love for people to post stories about how they “Spent their 2 Hours” on the Game Changer Movement Facebook page (www.facebook.com/gamechangersexperience)                              

We are going to develop a strategic vision for the rePURPOSEing of the 1,000,000 games that are turned in.  We will exhibit or sell the pieces that we are calling Conversation PEACES.  We will be creating the Conversation PEACES as part of a nationwide tour, where we invite parents and youth into our mobile living room so that we might create art and have conversations about how to bring the unit back to the family and transform the connection that is possible.
We will collaborate with schools, community centers, athletic and entertainment venues as we curate events across the country.  We are setting out with more questions than answers, and we will share what we learn along the way as we transform violence into art.                                                                           
We are going to help our emotional landscape by rePURPOSEing violent content and media into art, and we will help our physical landscape as we eventually redirect the CDs and DVDs from the landfills of our nations to the walls and living rooms of our houses and boardrooms.  We are going to lift up youth facing homelessness as we create the Conversation PEACEs in youth shelters along the way.  We hope to create a business model that will allow youth facing homelessness to franchise the Game Changer Movement brand as we take social entrepreneurship to the next level!
What is this summer looking like for you and your family?Were you looking forward to a connection with your kids as the last day of school came and went?Were the hours spent at school replaced by hours spent playing video games?Do you find yourself rolling your eyes and saying things like, ""When I was your age, I went outside right after breakfast and I didn't come back in, until dinner time....""Are you concerned about the content that many of the games contain?Do you know what games are being played when your kids visit their friends?Do you know who the voices are in the headphones when kids play live games?
What is the history of the Game Changer Movement?On November 15th, 2013 the Game Changer Movement
was born!  We are here to rePURPOSE our
HEARTdrives with each other.  About 2
months after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Erik Lehmann,
father of three, had a powerful vision. 
He wanted to let kids know just how much they matter right now!  Upon looking around, he saw that our youth
are often told all the ways that they don’t matter.  They can’t work until age 14, drive until age
16, can’t vote until 18, and can’t drink alcohol until age 21.  Much of a child’s school day is spent
passively consuming the information and taking the tests that adults believe
they should take!  The Game Changer
Movement is here to encourage children to know that they have a choice to be
significant right now!  Tony Robbins, a
human behavior expert, considers significance; one of the six main drivers of
human behavior.  This is true at any age!
What does it mean to rePURPOSE our HEARTdrives?
We are inspiring 1,000,000 youth to trade in at least one violent video game.  We
have developed a low tech robot whose sole mission is to collect the violent
video games in a community near you.  We
are going to transform and rePURPOSE the games that are collected from the
robots into art, furniture, signs, and other transformational expressions.  We will decommission the violent content and
create a new PURPOSE for the CDs, DVDs, and their cases.

We will travel the country,curating events and programs with
youth and their caregivers.  We are
designing a mobile living room that will be launched so that we can have real
conversations about how to bring the
unit back to the family.  The family
looks very different now than it has looked in the past, and with this new
look; comes new challenges and opportunities! We will create what we call Conversation PEACES as we talk WITH each other and create art, signs or
rePURPOSE furniture in each community on the national tour.  We are going to share perspectives with
families all across the country and eventually the world.  Our collective HEARTdrive will be rePURPOSEd
from a fear and scarcity based world to a love and abundance based world.

Why are we focusing on violent video games in
this phase of the Game Changer Movement?
There is data indicating that both boys and
girls will play at least 10,000 hours of video games before they become 21 year
old men and women.  Currently 90% of the
popular video games contain violence at varying degrees…even games rated E10+.  This is the challenge and opportunity!  Malcolm Gladwell wrote about the magic of
spending 10,000 hours in pursuit of mastery in his book, Outliers.  If someone invested 10,000 hours into
something, they would likely come out a master at it!  With 90% of the games our kids play
containing violence, our kids are becoming masters at hurting and killing
instead of learning, growing, and loving. 
We, as parents, have an opportunity and perhaps even a responsibility to
help guide our kids towards applying more of those hours towards the common
good.  It is time for us all to change
our game, together! 
Gaming is not going away any time
soon.  In fact, gaming is actually
becoming a major educational modality, because of the active learning and sense
of significance that is embedded in
the game or the mission.  There are many
ways to create a sense of significance, and violence is one of the easiest in a
way.  In a first person shooter game, the
first person becomes immediately significant when they have a gun in their hand
and they control whether or not someone else lives or dies.  Combine the sense of significance that
violence creates with true to life graphics, and we are reinforcing a sense of
significance that has no real-life corollary. 
This might be ok, if, after our kids played the games, we sat down with
them and had a conversation with them. 
The challenge with this is, we think we are too busy already, so we
don’t take the time to connect with our kids and have the crucial conversations
necessary to let our kids know how significant they truly are already.  We, as parents know that the best way to
reach our kids is to actually meet them where they are, and see them eye to
eye, on their level!  This may mean that
we actually play video games with our kids and perhaps we can meet them in a
virtual world that has room for all members of the family, instead of having us
roll our eyes as the chasm between parents and their children widens by the
hour.

Tony Robbins speaks about 6 key drivers of
human behavior and they are: Certainty, Variety, Significance, Connection,
Growth, and Contribution.  When we look
at the virtual video gaming world it is very interesting that the gaming world
might be getting progressively better at offering these drivers as compared to
our real lives.  In her book, Reality is
Broken, by Jane McGonigal, she points out that the gaming world allows gamers
to achieve a sense of accomplishment, community, significance, and maybe even
contribution!  
Is
it possible to redirect the 10,000 hours of gaming time towards solving real
world challenges?  Can we create
challenges that inspire 1,000,000 youth to trade in violent video games in the
first place?  What will inspire today’s
youth to change their game?
In her book “Peers Inc”, Robin Chase
discusses the concept of excess capacity as an exponential opportunity in the
world of business and social change. 
Imagine what the world will look like when kids and adults alike apply
the excess capacity of their entertainment hours and gaming hours?  What if the first million youth who traded in
a violent video game were given a challenge to solve in the game or virtual
world that had immediate real world application?  How significant would those kids feel?  How happy would their parents be?  What if there were a gaming platform that
parents wanted their kids to play, because it taught them all the things they
needed to learn in an environment that reached them where they were already
looking?  Would there be as much ADD and
ADHD?  What would an educational
system  look like if it were augmented in
a symbiotic relationship with gaming platforms that complemented and reinforced
the subjects that were discussed during the school day?  
I am inspired about redirecting a good
portion of the 10,000 hours that youth spend playing video games towards games
that matter in the real world!  In 2007,
I read the book “The Power of Focus” by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, and
Les Hewitt.  In that book there was a
recommendation to take an hour a day from unproductive time and invest it into
a new pursuit.  When I read this, I
decided to take an hour from TV and start running for at least an hour a day.  By July of 2008, I crossed the finish line of
a 15K, or 9.3 mile road race called the Boiler Maker Race in Utica, NY.  By November 2010, I crossed the finish line
of the New York City Marathon, and I have run the Honolulu Marathon twice since
then.  I share this because I learned
what becomes possible when time is redirected from something unproductive and
invested in something growth oriented. 
All this happened by redirecting just one hour a day.  What would the world look like if 1,000,000
youth redirected their gaming hours from non-productive and violent gaming and
reinvested them into pro-social games that addressed real-life community or
societal challenges?  
Elan Musk, who co-founded Paypal, founded
Space X and Tesla, was in a conversation with Sal Khan, founder of the Khan
Academy about education and Elan recommended that he gamify education as much
as possible.  This is a great opportunity
for collaboration with schools, organizations, municipalities, and
corporations.  One way to create a sense
of significance is to search out real world challenges that can be brought into
the classroom environment.  Gamifying
also provides for an opportunity to learn how to fail gracefully and hopefully
faster.  Failure is what Elan Musk was
willing to do three times while developing Space X and his first three launches
failed before the forth succeeded and then Space X was granted an almost $2
Billion contract. Failure comprises 70% of the gaming world, and many
successful entrepreneurs attribute their largest successes to learning how to
get up after failure.  On the flip side
of failure, games allow for learning towards mastery with failure as a
necessary part of the process.
To make the story way more personal, I feel
compelled to share about some memories from the time I spent about 50 days
living in a homeless shelter for youth as a high school senior.  I was really lucky because the shelter was
located in the same school district where I was enrolled, so I did not miss any
school on account of my temporary homelessness. 
That said, all the other youth at the shelter were not as
fortunate.  The shelter offered tutoring
to the other youth; however, the tutors were not very consistent and then the
video games that were available were very violent in nature, and there were no
conversations about making such choices of how to spend our time.  I have visited youth shelters over the past
few years and the video game options in shelters are getting progressively more
violent.  Imagine if there was an
alternative available to these kids! 
These kids are some of the most resourceful people I have ever known in
my entire life!  I am so looking forward
to helping these youth to redirect their time allocation choices.  These kids, who have been invisible, to so
many, may, in fact make a huge contribution to this planet.  I believe in these kids, because I was one of
them!",4.0,1,"5 Campaigns

<h3 style=""padding-top:20px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h4 style=""padding-top:10px;"">What We Need</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> Development of <b><i>Holodance</i></b> has already started and come a long ways, so we only need $15,000 more to complete the first version of the game to release it together with the release of the HTC Vive at the end of this year. We have one developer (Jashan Chittesh) working full-time on the project already:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6,000 for three more months of development</li>
<li>$3,000 for three more months of renting the office space</li>
<li>$2,000 for additional hardware</li>
<li>$1,500 for IndieGoGo and processing fees</li>
<li>$1,500 for taxes</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;padding-top:10px;"">There are a few stretch goals we're considering, like: porting Holodance to AR (target platforms: <b>Hololens</b> and <b>Magic Leap</b>), building an <b>in-game editor</b> and <b>community-features</b> so you can use your own MP3s, built-in support for <b>sharing your sessions</b>, and if you want us to really go wild, we might even port Holodance to <b>mobile with a tap-based interface</b>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;padding-top:10px;""><i>Let us know which ones you are interested in via the comments!</i></p>
<p>Any of these will only be started once the initial game is complete and released. More details will be announced in due time.</p>
<p>We may also add additional target platforms like <b>OSVR</b>, <b>FOVE (with eye-tracking)</b>, <b>Leap Motion (use your plain hands)</b>, <b>STEM Controllers (kick dem notes wit your feet)</b>, motion capturing suits like <b>PrioVR</b> and <b>Perception Neuron</b> for full body-immersion and whatever else actually works and is requested by ... you! ;-)</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438120909/uryfg3rbdqwsjctojzin.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h4 style=""padding-top:10px;"">What You Get</h4>
<p>You can contribute in various tiers according to your desired level of commitment:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Supporter:</b> You just want to support this project by giving as little or much as you like without asking for much in return. As a <i>Callout Supporter</i>, you are mentioned with a tweet, optionally with a link to your Website.</li>
<li>
<b>Gamer:</b> You get the game, either on release or a month earlier. No risks involved, no questions asked.</li>
<li>
<b>Beta-Player:</b> You get the betas - immediately or after the early beta people already tested them for two weeks. Early beta access includes a private forum to discuss issues (this forum is public for viewing but only people with early beta access are allowed to post). There's also an <i>Unlimited Version</i> that will later include any upcoming addons (those are music packages created by narayana games or third parties after the game was released).</li>
<li>
<b>Sponsors:</b> You pay more and get the credits ... and <i>unlimited beta-access</i>, of course. As a sponsor, you'll also be able to show off your level of sponsorship in the game and you'll be mentioned on Twitter, like a <i>Callout Supporter</i> but with your level of sponsorship included in the Tweet. We appreciate every level of participation - but we really need you <i>Sponsors</i>, <i>Silver Sponsors</i> and <i>Gold Sponsors</i>. Thank you!</li>
<li>
<b>Collaborator:</b> This one is really special and only available three times: We have reserved three spots for people who want to work with me one-on-one to build three unique levels as part of the standard game. Each Collaborator can have a say on one level: You decide the name and theme of the level and we'll provide music and art as needed (if you want to provide your own - that's also fine, of course). Those three levels will always be included in the game, in addition to the 12 main levels but as extra levels that don't have to be unlocked and are always available to everyone. So if we find three collaborators, we will have 15 levels altogether. <i>This is your opportunity to not only help make this happen but also shape how it happens!</i> There's one limitation to keep in mind: Your level will have to fit the ""sustainable"" theme of the game (see below), so if you are considering having me add a Zombie-level where you blow things up: No, sorry, won't happen!</li>
<li>
<b>Addon Creator:</b> If you want to build addon packages with your own music (that you own all rights to) and level design yourself, contact us directly. That will be handled through a profit sharing model. This is not something that you can buy into, you have to qualify for it - but it might very well end up being something paying you well.</li>
<li>
<b>Awesome people spreading the message:</b> No matter on which level you contribute: Please spread the word and let other people know about Holodance!</li>

<h3 style=""padding-top:20px;"">The Impact: Sustainable Games for VR/AR</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>narayana games</i> is all about <i>sustainable games</i>. What does that mean? We believe games are an incredibly powerful means of communication: When you build a game, you say something, and you say it loud. So the question is: Are we, as game developers, aware of what we're actually saying? And are we saying something that the world really needs? Or are we pushing out a message against flourishing life? Are we part of the problem by encouraging competition - or are we part of solution by inspiring creativity and respect for life?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>Holodance</i></b> is a perfect example of a sustainable game: It's all about creativity, music and dancing, collaborating and joy: When you enter a multiplayer session in Holodance, it's not you against the other(s) - it's about mastering the level together and sharing a good time. You can do it alone, on your own, that's fine - but it will naturally take longer. Just like in real life. And playing this game should even be something that your body likes because <b style=""font-style: italic;"">you've got to move! </b>We believe VR should not be a couch-potatoe experience but a dynamic, joyful experience that involves as many senses as possible.</p>
<p>
<b><i>narayana games</i></b> has already worked on several other sustainable games:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Traces of Illumination</i>, while based on Snake / Lightcycles turned the us against them mechanics of boxing the enemy to make them crash into being considerate to not have players of your own team or other teams into the walls. While this game still starts kind of competitive, the last level can only be completed when all players of all teams work together. Development on Traces of Illumination is currently on hold and will be resumed after we've released a few smaller titles like Holodance ;-)
</li>
<li>
<i>Resurrect</i> is a short combat / magic / VR demo initially built as a demo project for ScoreFlash (a Unity Addon we're selling on the Asset Store), which allows you to either heal or destroy two skeletons and later a golem. It's up to you to decide - but your decision has consequences that you'll have to live with ... until you try again. The idea is to take the fun that strategic combat can be and put it into a context of non-harming.</li>
<li>
<i>Save the Bots</i> is a free demo project for ScoreFlash available on the Unity Asset Store that took the Angry Bots demo provided by Unity Technologies and turned the mechanics from ""kill the robots"" to ""save the robots"" - with a funny ending when you succeeded.</li>

<h3 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The greatest risk we're facing right now is when we'll be getting the HTC Vive and Sony Project Morpheus development kits. Until we get this hardware, a setup of Oculus DK2 + Razor Hydra + (optional) Microsoft Kinect One is used, which comes with limitations for an experience designed for room-scale VR (but don't worry - Holodance can scale down to a ""standing experience"" if you don't have more space available ... you could even play it sitting, if you have a good reason to do so).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have already tested the current version with an HTC Vive Development kit and confirmed that it works (and quite well, in fact) - and will keep sending builds to friends with those HTC Vive DevKits until we have our own to assure things don't break. Here's an actual gameplay video that was recorded using the HTC Vive development kit:</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F135086492&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F135086492&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F528867917_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Eventually, the HTC Vive will be available to consumers and if all else fails, we'll do the final testing of the completed game on a consumer version. Hopefully we will get the DevKit still during this summer - and the more people are excited and supportive of Holodance, the more likely Valve / HTC will join into that excitement and send us a kit. We don't know how exactly they select the developers that receive the DevKits but one thing that might help, and that you can help with, is by <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=494183373"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Greenlighting Holodance</a> (<a href=""http://greenlight-holodance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">direct link into Steam</a>).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With Sony Project Morpheus, it all depends on Sony: narayana games is currently in the queue to become a PS4 partner and once that's through we'll order the development kits - and then it's up to Sony decide whether we will get one. But we're positive that they will like Holodance as much as we do and then it's in their best interest to get their development kits into our office. Porting itself is fairly easy, just like with the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers (we already have an abstraction layer in place for these kinds of things which works very well).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another challenge is networked multiplayer in a fast-paced music game. The problem is that it might look very weird when there's even a little delay due to network latency. Most likely this won't really be a problem because players are too busy handling their own notes so they won't have much time to check if the other players are perfectly in sync. However, if this does become an actual problem, we have a few ideas for solutions. This is something we will put a lot of attention on once we deliver the first betas.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438121020/zwnrntxumyyqkdh8r0kf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;padding-top:80px;padding-bottom:50px;"">Pledge now!!!</h1></div>","UPDATE (2016-03-11): You can now find Holodance on Steam - it's going into Early Access on April 5th. If you have preordered an HTC Vive, you might want to get it :-)

narayana games is a Virtual Reality game development studio founded in 2011 by Jashan Chittesh, author of ""Das Unity-Buch"" (the #1 selling German book on Amazon in category Games Programming). Holodance is not just one but many dreams coming true and you can help us get there in due time:
Building a collaborative multiplayer Virtual Reality gaming experience that makes you dance in joy! Enter a new dimension of reality and tune into the rhythms of the virtual to bring back the harmony to the real! All music is composed and produced specifically for this VR experience using binaural audio and the levels are designed to perfectly match the sound to give you:

A spatial, rhythmic, audio-visual experience of pure ecstatic joy!
Think of Holodance as a music video that you can enter and play with. But it's not just a 2D video - it's an actual reality that touches hearing and seeing and hopefully your heart!
Holodance is designed for these official target platforms:

SteamVR / HTC Vive (to be released still in 2015)
Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers (to be released first half of 2016)
Sony Project Morpheus with Motion Move Controllers (to be released 2016)

We target a 90+ framerate when using the Oculus minimum hardware requirements (GeForce 970 or faster, i5 or faster). At the moment, unfortunately, Virtual Reality is only fully supported on Windows. But as soon as SteamVR becomes available for Mac and Linux (which is already announced), we will also support those two operating systems.




What We Need & What You Get
What We Need
 Development of Holodance has already started and come a long ways, so we only need $15,000 more to complete the first version of the game to release it together with the release of the HTC Vive at the end of this year. We have one developer (Jashan Chittesh) working full-time on the project already:

$6,000 for three more months of development
$3,000 for three more months of renting the office space
$2,000 for additional hardware
$1,500 for IndieGoGo and processing fees
$1,500 for taxes

There are a few stretch goals we're considering, like: porting Holodance to AR (target platforms: Hololens and Magic Leap), building an in-game editor and community-features so you can use your own MP3s, built-in support for sharing your sessions, and if you want us to really go wild, we might even port Holodance to mobile with a tap-based interface.Let us know which ones you are interested in via the comments!
Any of these will only be started once the initial game is complete and released. More details will be announced in due time.
We may also add additional target platforms like OSVR, FOVE (with eye-tracking), Leap Motion (use your plain hands), STEM Controllers (kick dem notes wit your feet), motion capturing suits like PrioVR and Perception Neuron for full body-immersion and whatever else actually works and is requested by ... you! ;-)
What You Get
You can contribute in various tiers according to your desired level of commitment:


Supporter: You just want to support this project by giving as little or much as you like without asking for much in return. As a Callout Supporter, you are mentioned with a tweet, optionally with a link to your Website.

Gamer: You get the game, either on release or a month earlier. No risks involved, no questions asked.

Beta-Player: You get the betas - immediately or after the early beta people already tested them for two weeks. Early beta access includes a private forum to discuss issues (this forum is public for viewing but only people with early beta access are allowed to post). There's also an Unlimited Version that will later include any upcoming addons (those are music packages created by narayana games or third parties after the game was released).

Sponsors: You pay more and get the credits ... and unlimited beta-access, of course. As a sponsor, you'll also be able to show off your level of sponsorship in the game and you'll be mentioned on Twitter, like a Callout Supporter but with your level of sponsorship included in the Tweet. We appreciate every level of participation - but we really need you Sponsors, Silver Sponsors and Gold Sponsors. Thank you!

Collaborator: This one is really special and only available three times: We have reserved three spots for people who want to work with me one-on-one to build three unique levels as part of the standard game. Each Collaborator can have a say on one level: You decide the name and theme of the level and we'll provide music and art as needed (if you want to provide your own - that's also fine, of course). Those three levels will always be included in the game, in addition to the 12 main levels but as extra levels that don't have to be unlocked and are always available to everyone. So if we find three collaborators, we will have 15 levels altogether. This is your opportunity to not only help make this happen but also shape how it happens! There's one limitation to keep in mind: Your level will have to fit the ""sustainable"" theme of the game (see below), so if you are considering having me add a Zombie-level where you blow things up: No, sorry, won't happen!

Addon Creator: If you want to build addon packages with your own music (that you own all rights to) and level design yourself, contact us directly. That will be handled through a profit sharing model. This is not something that you can buy into, you have to qualify for it - but it might very well end up being something paying you well.

Awesome people spreading the message: No matter on which level you contribute: Please spread the word and let other people know about Holodance!

The more people start holodancing,the more friends you'll have to play with!

The Impact: Sustainable Games for VR/AR
narayana games is all about sustainable games. What does that mean? We believe games are an incredibly powerful means of communication: When you build a game, you say something, and you say it loud. So the question is: Are we, as game developers, aware of what we're actually saying? And are we saying something that the world really needs? Or are we pushing out a message against flourishing life? Are we part of the problem by encouraging competition - or are we part of solution by inspiring creativity and respect for life?
Holodance is a perfect example of a sustainable game: It's all about creativity, music and dancing, collaborating and joy: When you enter a multiplayer session in Holodance, it's not you against the other(s) - it's about mastering the level together and sharing a good time. You can do it alone, on your own, that's fine - but it will naturally take longer. Just like in real life. And playing this game should even be something that your body likes because you've got to move! We believe VR should not be a couch-potatoe experience but a dynamic, joyful experience that involves as many senses as possible.

narayana games has already worked on several other sustainable games:


Traces of Illumination, while based on Snake / Lightcycles turned the us against them mechanics of boxing the enemy to make them crash into being considerate to not have players of your own team or other teams into the walls. While this game still starts kind of competitive, the last level can only be completed when all players of all teams work together. Development on Traces of Illumination is currently on hold and will be resumed after we've released a few smaller titles like Holodance ;-)


Resurrect is a short combat / magic / VR demo initially built as a demo project for ScoreFlash (a Unity Addon we're selling on the Asset Store), which allows you to either heal or destroy two skeletons and later a golem. It's up to you to decide - but your decision has consequences that you'll have to live with ... until you try again. The idea is to take the fun that strategic combat can be and put it into a context of non-harming.

Save the Bots is a free demo project for ScoreFlash available on the Unity Asset Store that took the Angry Bots demo provided by Unity Technologies and turned the mechanics from ""kill the robots"" to ""save the robots"" - with a funny ending when you succeeded.




Risks & Challenges
The greatest risk we're facing right now is when we'll be getting the HTC Vive and Sony Project Morpheus development kits. Until we get this hardware, a setup of Oculus DK2 + Razor Hydra + (optional) Microsoft Kinect One is used, which comes with limitations for an experience designed for room-scale VR (but don't worry - Holodance can scale down to a ""standing experience"" if you don't have more space available ... you could even play it sitting, if you have a good reason to do so).We have already tested the current version with an HTC Vive Development kit and confirmed that it works (and quite well, in fact) - and will keep sending builds to friends with those HTC Vive DevKits until we have our own to assure things don't break. Here's an actual gameplay video that was recorded using the HTC Vive development kit:



Eventually, the HTC Vive will be available to consumers and if all else fails, we'll do the final testing of the completed game on a consumer version. Hopefully we will get the DevKit still during this summer - and the more people are excited and supportive of Holodance, the more likely Valve / HTC will join into that excitement and send us a kit. We don't know how exactly they select the developers that receive the DevKits but one thing that might help, and that you can help with, is by Greenlighting Holodance (direct link into Steam).
With Sony Project Morpheus, it all depends on Sony: narayana games is currently in the queue to become a PS4 partner and once that's through we'll order the development kits - and then it's up to Sony decide whether we will get one. But we're positive that they will like Holodance as much as we do and then it's in their best interest to get their development kits into our office. Porting itself is fairly easy, just like with the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers (we already have an abstraction layer in place for these kinds of things which works very well).
Another challenge is networked multiplayer in a fast-paced music game. The problem is that it might look very weird when there's even a little delay due to network latency. Most likely this won't really be a problem because players are too busy handling their own notes so they won't have much time to check if the other players are perfectly in sync. However, if this does become an actual problem, we have a few ideas for solutions. This is something we will put a lot of attention on once we deliver the first betas.
Other Ways You Can Help
Once again: Even if you can't contribute with money right now, you can still help this get funded by spreading the message. Keep in mind: This is not just about having yet another music game built, it's about establishing sustainable games for VR: We want Virtual Reality to be as much as possible a positive medium that is healthy for the body and fun for the generations to come.
Indiegogo also provides share tools to make spreading the word easy - but sometimes a personal invitation email can have much more impact. And keep in mind: If the flap of a butterfly could cause a storm on the other side of the world, your word could change the world!

Your contribution is extremely important in helping the COLOR to come to life. By contributing to this campaign you will also get a copy of the game at special price, available only through this campaign.









  
COLOR: Strategy Board Game is a
turn-by-turn multi-player game where players are colonizing territories, collecting
resources, building connections and mines, discovering hidden lands and passing
through positive or negative events.
It can be played by two, up to
four players aged ten years and up. The playing time is around 30 to 60
minutes. The game can be easily played even at the very first time without being an experienced player.

GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW

RULES OVERVIEW




Complete rulebook will be available soon.

GAMEPLAY


There are several types of
resources with different rarity and value. These are used for building,
upgrading and various actions. 



Resources can be gathered from lands. There are
also unknown lands that can be discovered.



At the beginning the entire world
is hidden and players must pick a land to build the first base.


The first base discovers
the bordering lands and is gathering resources from the surroundings. 



For additional income, you
can build connections from base, and then build mines. 



You can scout the hidden lands and find new
resources. 



Multiple players can have
buildings on the same land. You may build on specific slots to avoid opponent’s
intrusion. Each land has a limited number of slots that can be used, and once it is full, nothing else can be built on that land. 



Sometimes you may not have all the necessary resources for a
building or action, but you can trade with the bank at a higher rate or trade with
other players.



Events are positive or negative. These may
randomly occur at every turn.



To win the game, you must collect a certain number
of victory points. These are achieved by building and expanding own
territory...  









TURN-BY-TURN


At each turn one player is
throwing two dice with colored faces. First die represent the event called for
the current turn – it can be none, often or rare event. 


The events can be
positive or negative and can affect one or multiple players. 


The second die represents the resource generated at
current turn. Current player is gathering resources in dependence of buildings
owned on specific lands.


The second part of the turn is
building, trading or taking an action (like SCOUTING a hidden land).  


At the end of the turn, the
current player must make sure to not have more resources in hand than the
supply capacity. To do so, the player can spend the resources, trade or
discard.

<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Assault</span></h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>Assault is the main game mode of Galactic Warfare and we believe that its a unique game mode, In Assault the main objective is to destroy the opposing forces and their main capital ship as well as defending your own. There is a reinforcement based system for each team starting at 500, this declines as players die (1 death per reinforcement) but destroying the enemies capital ship will prevent  reinforcements completely which means the players wont be able to re spawn. This makes teamwork and communication vital to get a victory. Who ever destroys the enemies  capital ship will most probably be victorious, but you never know how the battle will play out.</p>
<p>Completing secondary missions will grant you more reinforcements as well as individual experience points, which could be the deciding factor on who gets victory, so in a team you can have a few players depleting the the enemies reinforcements while others work on objectives to gain reinforcements for your team. So breaking it down, 1 squadron can be attacking the enemy fighter ships to stop them completing objectives and attacking your own ships, while another squadron attacks the  capital ship as your squadron works on completing the objectives, this is why we believe in teamwork and communication is important. </p>
<p></p>
<h4>Classic Team Deathmatch</h4>
<div>no twists, no capital ships, just classic team versus team in a head on space battle, which ever team  has the most kills in the given time is victorious.</div>
<h4>Free for all  </h4>

<div>
<p>Taking down the capital ship is no easy task, for one the capital ship is gigantic!. Its not as simple as you would think it to be. You have to think tactically on what part of the ship you want to destroy first, within your team you have to decide which is more important. For the capital ship to take damage you have to destroy its shields by destroying the shield array, once the shields are down you then have a few choices to make, do you want to go in for the kill and destroy the capital ship as quickly as possible, which can be difficult with the enemy fighter ships attacking you, or you can try and get an advantage on the other team.</p>
<p>The options you have are that you can destroy the command tower which will wipe out all communications for the other team, they will not be able to talk to other team members restricting them to only having communication with squad members as your ships have local communication antennas. </p>
<p>The capital ship has a huge arsenal of turrets which can do alot of damage to your ships or more importantly your teams capital ship, as the two capital ship are slowly moving closer to one another,  you can prevent this by destroying the generators which power the turrets (each generator powers 2-4 turrets).</p>
<p>You can make the enemies capital ship vulnerable by destroying its engines which will prevent it from moving towards your capital ship, in addition to that you can make the ship rotate and lose complete control by destroying its gravitation gyro which will cause the ship to slowly tilt and gradually start to spin and float away. </p>

<div>Along with our unique game mode we are introducing random galactic events, space is a naturally dangerous place, with this understanding we have created game changing events which happen randomly throughout the assault game mode which can catch you of guard and  have devastating effects on the games outcome. </div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<h4>Meteor Shower</h4>
<div>Fairly obvious to what this event does.  Meteor showers occur when a comet comes close to a star and produces debris - meteoroids. </div>
<div>Just as your flying around you may hear a loud rumble then you look up to see hundreds of meteoroids hurly towards your team destroying anything its path. The only thing you can do is dodge them and hope they pass quickly.</div>
<div>
<h4>Supernova</h4>
<div>A <b>supernova</b> is a enormous explosion that briefly outshines an entire galaxy, radiating as much energy as a star emits over its entire life span. The extremely luminous burst of radiation expels much or all of a star's material<span style=""font-size: 12px; line-height: 0px;""> </span>at a velocity of up to 30,000 km/s (10% of the speed of light), driving a shock wave into the surrounding area. <br/>
</div>
<div>You will get a  warning before this event happens, you may notice a dying star imploding in the vary far distance then in a matter of seconds you will be blinded by light followed by a huge shock wave which will make you ship fly out of control and throwing asteroids and any debris with it. the only thing you can do is to hold on tight and hope nothings hits your ship. </div>
<div>
<h4>Titan </h4>
<div>Titans are the biggest spaceship known to mankind, shadowing any capital ship and was built for one purpose, DESTRUCTION! </div>
<div>Out of know where a titan ship can appear, as you stare while in shock of its over whelming size it will fire its main weapon across the area not caring which team it hits. This is truly devastating and has the biggest impact in the game but it is also the rarest of the events.</div>

* early render of first default Spaceship (Above)



Assault


Assault is the main game mode of Galactic Warfare and we believe that its a unique game mode, In Assault the main objective is to destroy the opposing forces and their main capital ship as well as defending your own. There is a reinforcement based system for each team starting at 500, this declines as players die (1 death per reinforcement) but destroying the enemies capital ship will prevent  reinforcements completely which means the players wont be able to re spawn. This makes teamwork and communication vital to get a victory. Who ever destroys the enemies  capital ship will most probably be victorious, but you never know how the battle will play out.
Completing secondary missions will grant you more reinforcements as well as individual experience points, which could be the deciding factor on who gets victory, so in a team you can have a few players depleting the the enemies reinforcements while others work on objectives to gain reinforcements for your team. So breaking it down, 1 squadron can be attacking the enemy fighter ships to stop them completing objectives and attacking your own ships, while another squadron attacks the  capital ship as your squadron works on completing the objectives, this is why we believe in teamwork and communication is important. 

Classic Team Deathmatch
no twists, no capital ships, just classic team versus team in a head on space battle, which ever team  has the most kills in the given time is victorious.
Free for all  
limited to only 20 players and taking place in smaller parts of the universe this mode is to really prove who is the best pilot in the galaxy






Taking down the capital ship is no easy task, for one the capital ship is gigantic!. Its not as simple as you would think it to be. You have to think tactically on what part of the ship you want to destroy first, within your team you have to decide which is more important. For the capital ship to take damage you have to destroy its shields by destroying the shield array, once the shields are down you then have a few choices to make, do you want to go in for the kill and destroy the capital ship as quickly as possible, which can be difficult with the enemy fighter ships attacking you, or you can try and get an advantage on the other team.
The options you have are that you can destroy the command tower which will wipe out all communications for the other team, they will not be able to talk to other team members restricting them to only having communication with squad members as your ships have local communication antennas. 
The capital ship has a huge arsenal of turrets which can do alot of damage to your ships or more importantly your teams capital ship, as the two capital ship are slowly moving closer to one another,  you can prevent this by destroying the generators which power the turrets (each generator powers 2-4 turrets).
You can make the enemies capital ship vulnerable by destroying its engines which will prevent it from moving towards your capital ship, in addition to that you can make the ship rotate and lose complete control by destroying its gravitation gyro which will cause the ship to slowly tilt and gradually start to spin and float away. 



Unlock blueprints and earn credits to purchase your ships parts and weapons, upgrade your ships armour, shields, wings, engines and weapons with our 3 tier system and have the ability to fully customise your ships, you have full control of the following:

Primary and secondary coloursDecalsClan EmblemLightsShield colour and patternThruster ColourPlasma ammunitionApply Skins (Exclusive skin packs or purchase skin packs)




You are able to team up with your mates to form your on fighter squadron and even form your own clan and to create your own clan emblem to place on your ship to wear with pride. 
We are introducing a voice and text system to be able to communicate with your team mates as well as your squad and even have your own private clan channel. However this can change throughout the game if your communication array has been destroyed.



We are working very hard to allow players to choose between third or first person cockpit views. At first third person is only available but first person cockpit view is milestone we are very keen on achieving at an early stage. Eventually introducing the game to VR ( Virtual Reality) cockpits. We believe that VR is the future of space games and are very passionate about it.





Along with our unique game mode we are introducing random galactic events, space is a naturally dangerous place, with this understanding we have created game changing events which happen randomly throughout the assault game mode which can catch you of guard and  have devastating effects on the games outcome. 

Meteor Shower
Fairly obvious to what this event does.  Meteor showers occur when a comet comes close to a star and produces debris - meteoroids. 
Just as your flying around you may hear a loud rumble then you look up to see hundreds of meteoroids hurly towards your team destroying anything its path. The only thing you can do is dodge them and hope they pass quickly.

Supernova
A supernova is a enormous explosion that briefly outshines an entire galaxy, radiating as much energy as a star emits over its entire life span. The extremely luminous burst of radiation expels much or all of a star's material at a velocity of up to 30,000 km/s (10% of the speed of light), driving a shock wave into the surrounding area. 

You will get a  warning before this event happens, you may notice a dying star imploding in the vary far distance then in a matter of seconds you will be blinded by light followed by a huge shock wave which will make you ship fly out of control and throwing asteroids and any debris with it. the only thing you can do is to hold on tight and hope nothings hits your ship. 

Titan 
Titans are the biggest spaceship known to mankind, shadowing any capital ship and was built for one purpose, DESTRUCTION! 
Out of know where a titan ship can appear, as you stare while in shock of its over whelming size it will fire its main weapon across the area not caring which team it hits. This is truly devastating and has the biggest impact in the game but it is also the rarest of the events.




We are using the new Substance Live package to produce the next generation of materials, PBR (Physically Based Renders) this was a huge leap for us at Polymorphik Games and it has paid of well. Using this software has enable us to do so much more than we ever anticipated. Substance Designer and Substance Painter work really well within Unity 5, our engine of choice, also Space looks amazing using Unity 5's built in global illumination and our 4k textures.

<p>Have you ever imagined what would be like a <strong>Formula One</strong> championship <strong>a thousand years from now</strong>? This is the main premise behind the RITG story.</p>
<p>Instead of <i>Austria GP</i>, we have <i>Mars GP</i>. But the space travel is so advanced that the human race reached all the galaxy. A new championship was made where every year the best pilots of the galaxy are gathered on a <strong>huge spaceship</strong>.</p>
<p>This spaceship holds all the team manufacturers, staff people, pilots, journalists, and so on. It is <strong>like a city that moves from planet to planet every other week</strong>.</p>
<p>It is in this context that all the game events happens. There will be events occurring while you are on the ship. Industrial <strong>spies</strong>, <strong>saboteurs</strong>, and all that.</p>
<p>Every year the planets participating on the championship changes. The pilots never know what challenges expects them. (You can keep playing after finishing the championship)</p>
<p>Welcome to the <i>Race In The Galaxy Championship</i>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478496241/pg7jkxwf1lgzn8jibepk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>TLDR; read the bold text.</p>
<p>The game can be divided into <strong>2 parts</strong>: <strong>Inside and outside the cockpit</strong>.</p>
<p>You will start your campaign creating your character. You will <strong>choose a name and appearance</strong>.</p>
<p>This character is not famous (yet), so you have to prove yourself on a minor championship (tutorial) in order to get attention from the big teams on the RITG.</p>
<p>(you can always skip the tutorial and go directly to the team choosing part)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478442230/v2uetccmnwjtyqjrgpyt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In each new game, <strong>the teams will have different names, colors, logos, preferred car, and technology level</strong>. Depending on your difficulty settings, you will get a list of teams with more or less popularity and technology levels.</p>
<p>You will start as a ""secondary"" pilot, and sometimes you will be asked by your team to let your partner, the primary pilot, to finish in front of you.</p>
<p>Depending on <strong>your decisions to accept or disobey your team</strong>, and the different outcomes (get at first or last place, for example), your <strong>relationship with your team and partner</strong> will be altered.</p>
<p>These <strong>relationships</strong> will affect directly on the different <strong>random events</strong> that might happen between the races.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478407273/oa9il701ra9bazg7ukb8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Eventually some other pilot will become your <strong>rival</strong>. This will be a character that will receive special attention on your <strong>interviews with journalists</strong>, and it will affect some random events, impacting on your <strong>popularity</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478407313/dnm2pttrlqs8eilks69h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The game has a <strong>procedural technology system</strong>, and the way you get <strong>new techs</strong> is by <strong>keeping your team popularity high</strong>. This represents the money received from sponsors.</p>
<p>In order to gain popularity, you need to <strong>win races </strong>and <strong>stay out of trouble</strong> (or not).</p>
<p>Now, <strong>inside the cockpit</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478407356/xk9ybebybyiw3jr9w9pk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The game will feature <strong>10 different cars</strong>, with different attributes.</p>
<p>These attributes are: <strong>Speed</strong>, <strong>Acceleration</strong>, <strong>Turning </strong>and <strong>Defense</strong>.</p>
<p>Each car will give you a <strong>unique way</strong> to play the game. You can try to destroy your opponents, keep your advantage on long straights, play carefully trying not to crash... It all depends on your <strong>attributes</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>skills </strong>and <strong>modifiers</strong>.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/8SsY109.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> <img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/8Azq88C.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The way you control your car is different from a normal racing game, because <strong>your car is floating on the air</strong>. You will have to <strong>think in zero gravity</strong>. If you stop accelerating and turn your car, it will keep going forward, until you accelerate again. This means that your break/reverse is a backwards impulse.</p>
<p>The game will feature <strong>car explosions and pilot deaths</strong>. Be careful.</p>

</div></div>","Up until now we financed the development of Race In The Galaxy with contract works and side jobs. Now we finally want to show you what the game is all about and ask for your support so we can start to work on our dream full-time!
We are a team of 3, and with Indiegogo we want to raise funds to finish the development of our game with the quality that it deserves. Please read on to know more about it.
If you don't know what Indiegogo is: you can support us by buying the perks listed on the side and you will receive everything listed on your perk when those things get finished.
Please read on to know more about the game, the team and the prizes!
 


Have you ever imagined what would be like a Formula One championship a thousand years from now? This is the main premise behind the RITG story.
Instead of Austria GP, we have Mars GP. But the space travel is so advanced that the human race reached all the galaxy. A new championship was made where every year the best pilots of the galaxy are gathered on a huge spaceship.
This spaceship holds all the team manufacturers, staff people, pilots, journalists, and so on. It is like a city that moves from planet to planet every other week.
It is in this context that all the game events happens. There will be events occurring while you are on the ship. Industrial spies, saboteurs, and all that.
Every year the planets participating on the championship changes. The pilots never know what challenges expects them. (You can keep playing after finishing the championship)
Welcome to the Race In The Galaxy Championship.


TLDR; read the bold text.
The game can be divided into 2 parts: Inside and outside the cockpit.
You will start your campaign creating your character. You will choose a name and appearance.
This character is not famous (yet), so you have to prove yourself on a minor championship (tutorial) in order to get attention from the big teams on the RITG.
(you can always skip the tutorial and go directly to the team choosing part)

In each new game, the teams will have different names, colors, logos, preferred car, and technology level. Depending on your difficulty settings, you will get a list of teams with more or less popularity and technology levels.
You will start as a ""secondary"" pilot, and sometimes you will be asked by your team to let your partner, the primary pilot, to finish in front of you.
Depending on your decisions to accept or disobey your team, and the different outcomes (get at first or last place, for example), your relationship with your team and partner will be altered.
These relationships will affect directly on the different random events that might happen between the races.

Eventually some other pilot will become your rival. This will be a character that will receive special attention on your interviews with journalists, and it will affect some random events, impacting on your popularity.

The game has a procedural technology system, and the way you get new techs is by keeping your team popularity high. This represents the money received from sponsors.
In order to gain popularity, you need to win races and stay out of trouble (or not).
Now, inside the cockpit.

The game will feature 10 different cars, with different attributes.
These attributes are: Speed, Acceleration, Turning and Defense.
Each car will give you a unique way to play the game. You can try to destroy your opponents, keep your advantage on long straights, play carefully trying not to crash... It all depends on your attributes, technology, skills and modifiers.
 
The way you control your car is different from a normal racing game, because your car is floating on the air. You will have to think in zero gravity. If you stop accelerating and turn your car, it will keep going forward, until you accelerate again. This means that your break/reverse is a backwards impulse.
The game will feature car explosions and pilot deaths. Be careful.
 




Development: All the programming and game design. This will enable Vinicius to work on the game as a full time job.
Illustration: All the characters and scenes used in the game will be handmade to fit this beautiful universe. This will enable Michele to work on the game as a part time job.
Soundtrack: All the musics will be unique to the game and will represent the mood on each type of planet. Daniel will take care of this.
Licenses + others: Software licenses such as Unity Plus and other stuff, like the Steam Greenlight fee.
Fees: Indiegogo and payment processing fees.
 


Name in credits under Turtle Tribe: Your name will be on the credits of the game in the Turtle Tribe category.
Name in credits in a special section: Your name will be bigger and displayed on a special section, before the Turtle Tribe section.
Steam Key: A key to be redeemed on Steam. This is the game.
Additional Steam Key: A secondary key to be redeemed on Steam. You can give it to a friend as a gift if you want.
Early Access Steam Key: A key to be redeemed on Steam that will enable early access (beta). You will be able to play the game before it is finished.
Itens from the Gold pack:
Digital Artbook: A PDF containing the art from the game. All the concept art, sketches, story behind some of the art decisions and all that.
Short Story: A PDF / EPUB / MOBI short story that happens inside the game universe.
Digital Poster: A high resolution image for you to use how you want. You can print it as a poster, or use it as a beautiful wallpaper.
Name in the game: Your name (or something else) as a pilot name on the game. The name needs to fit the game lore.
Squad: This is a special title in the community. You will be differentiated from the others as a Squad member, with a different color and the ability to enter on squad only text and voice channels on our discord server. You will also receive the right to vote on polls created by us, concerning the development of the game.
Digital Avatar Image: A custom avatar drawn by Michele, our concept artist. She will draw you based on a real photo, and you will look like a character from the game. You will receive a JPG image.
Create a custom event: You will be able to work with us and create a custom event that will happen between each race.
VIP: You will receive the VIP status on the community. This will give you the right to visit our offices and hang out with us, if you happen to be on our city. Also, you will receive all future games from us for free.
 

If we reach our goal, we will be able to launch the early access in the end of the first semester of 2017, and the full game on the second semester of 2017.
If we don't reach our initial goal, we will still be completing the game, but we can't promise any dates, because it will depend on how much we have raised. More info about this on the Risks and Challenges section.
Concerning Mac and Linux:

We are aware that most projects promise things that they are not sure if they can deliver. We are not going to do this. The Mac and Linux versions eventually will be release, but only after the main release for PC.
We think that it is better to focus our efforts on a single platform first, make it bug free, and then move to another platform.


The obvious risk is if we do not achieve the campaign goal. If this happens, we will prioritize the payment of the soundtrack and software licenses. The developer might need to take a part time job to earn some money while working on the game as a second part time job. The concept artist might need to change her role to be a freelancer, instead of a collaborator.
This means that the production of the game will take more time to finish, that's why we can't promise an exact release date. But we will NOT STOP.
We have managed to get here, starting from nothing. We overcame a lot of challenges, and they are never easy, but with determination and hard work we believe that we can overcome this risk.
We value transparency. If something goes wrong, the community will always be notified.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>We can't tell the difference between real and virtual anymore. If it's not online, it's not real. So let's make the realest thing we can: a virtual country! </p><p>We're starting Showupia: a virtual nation built from scratch where you're in power. It's a phone game that let's you connect face-to-face and capture politicians like pokemon. </p><p>Showupia is innovating on civic engagement. It's a map-based game that lets everyday people decide what's next. Power is shared and people own the politicians - literally! It's the only ultimate-reality, choose-your-own-adventure, upside-down democracy game. It helps people showup where it counts: not just to vote, but also to community meetings, local protests, and the halls of power. </p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Gameplay</span></h3><p>consists of two main parts: <br/>1) Walk around the real world and gain Influence by waking up Sheeple and catching pocket politicians. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Vote at them or literally shout at them to put the politician in your pocket. For more Influence, contact the real politician after you've owned them. </span><br/>2) Build Power (access and control over the game) by ""collaborating"" face-to-face with friends and neighbors. The higher your Power level, the more you decide the future of the nation. Kind of like being a Wikipedia moderator</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We’re designing this WITH you, but you won't have to do any work unless you want to. The game makes it easy to have your voice heard.</p><p>Claim your land in Showupia by becoming an investor and testing the game. Our rewards let you put yourself in the game - literally! To be a Sidekick, throw in $10 to help beta-test and nation-build. For $25, you become a Diplomat and can put yourself (or any gif you want) as a character in the game. For $50, you become a Superhero and get all that and a cape! For $100, you are UnFucking Believable: adopt a politician and decide how they look in the game. You can make them fabulous, or you can make them a steaming turd. Up to you!</p><p>If you want your brand to be part of the nation of Showupia (and get to use the game to help focus group, recruit, and put your events on the map), it’s $1000 to be a Visionary Power Brand. Only for the highly inspired!</p><p>As much as we hate asking for money, it’s a sad reality of capitalism. If we want to make something new, we need the dough to make it so. But that’s why we’re going to you instead of sucking up to corporations or big investors. We are shooting to raise $15,000 to cover the costs of this campaign and finish the development of the app, which includes:</p><ul>
<li>Changing the app to reflect testing feedback.</li>
<li>Running the app and web hosting</li>
<li>Campaign costs: graphic design, video production, social media marketing, website, fonts, promo materials, and community events to get the word out</li>
<li>Trademarks and copyright</li>
<li>Our stretch goals:<ul>
<li>If we reach over $30,000, we’ll create a co-op LLC where you (yes, YOU!) literally own the game with the rest of the community.</li>
<li>If we reach over $50,000, we'll create an open-source brand that chooses what we want to make and sends you community-decided products (along with a political dare/mission) each month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>If we don’t reach our goal, the costs will go towards covering the campaign costs. We will reassess and see how else we can get funds to develop during testing, but the prototype WILL be completed by the end of summer.</p><h3>Impact</h3><p>Showupia lets people take advantage of the blurred line between real and virtual to craft a new political culture in the streets and on phones simultaneously. We get it... politics blows. We’re not denying it. But in this world of crazy political theater and lives controlled by the Gram, we are adding some authenticity and humanity. Instead of trying to dismantle the system or hopeless incremental change, we are building a new system that works. </p><p>The idea for Showupia was sparked in 2016 when Pokemon Go was in full force during the worst election of our lives. Sam Bonar (aka Filiblaster, Showupia's Chief Sidekick) was blown away by a silly game’s ability to start a tiny revolution. People unintentionally got off their butts, in the streets, and made community easily and spontaneously. Simply by having a location-based game where the map is the real world, people naturally interacted in new ways. So here's an AR ecosystem designed with <strong><i>intention </i></strong>to make it easy to go where it counts. This is especially powerful for people living in DC who can show up in the face of power, but have no say in national politics.</p><p>This isn’t just another app owned by corporations sucking your eyeballs, data, and hard-earned cash out your pocket. This is a diy chance to play the game of power and have your voice heard as a collective roar. Become a grassroots community organizer and spontaneous activist just by exploring your city. </p><p>We don’t have all the answers and we can’t predict the future. But our movement is the only one that puts you in charge. Or just come along for the ride. We are doing this IndieGoGo (before the game is ready for public release) as a way of sparking the community that will shape and eventually OWN the technology. </p><p>You decide what we do with our data, what we advocate for, and which corporations we exploit. But first we need to make a killer game. For that, we need you in it: adding ideas, gifs, memes, feedback, and investing a little bit of your hard-earned cash.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We know not everyone can invest in something like this. STILL REACH OUT if you want to be a part of this new country. We're not trying to take your money - we’re trying to share power and make enough money to make it worth it for you to be involved.</p><p>Use the Indiegogo share tool, or share this link (<a href=""http://igg.me/at/showupia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">igg.me/at/showupia</a>). A new country is stronger with more citizens, so write an email or post to your followers about the new country they can help found. Like this one:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I'm helping build a new virtual country from scratch.

If it's not online, it's not real. So let's make the realest thing we can: a virtual country! We're starting Showupia: a virtual nation built from scratch where you're in power. It's a phone game that let's you connect face-to-face and capture politicians like pokemon. Showupia is innovating on civic engagement. It's a map-based game that lets everyday people decide what's next. Power is shared and people own the politicians - literally! It's the only ultimate-reality, choose-your-own-adventure, upside-down democracy game. It helps people showup where it counts: not just to vote, but also to community meetings, local protests, and the halls of power. The Gameplayconsists of two main parts: 1) Walk around the real world and gain Influence by waking up Sheeple and catching pocket politicians. Vote at them or literally shout at them to put the politician in your pocket. For more Influence, contact the real politician after you've owned them. 2) Build Power (access and control over the game) by ""collaborating"" face-to-face with friends and neighbors. The higher your Power level, the more you decide the future of the nation. Kind of like being a Wikipedia moderatorWhat We Need & What You GetWe’re designing this WITH you, but you won't have to do any work unless you want to. The game makes it easy to have your voice heard.Claim your land in Showupia by becoming an investor and testing the game. Our rewards let you put yourself in the game - literally! To be a Sidekick, throw in $10 to help beta-test and nation-build. For $25, you become a Diplomat and can put yourself (or any gif you want) as a character in the game. For $50, you become a Superhero and get all that and a cape! For $100, you are UnFucking Believable: adopt a politician and decide how they look in the game. You can make them fabulous, or you can make them a steaming turd. Up to you!If you want your brand to be part of the nation of Showupia (and get to use the game to help focus group, recruit, and put your events on the map), it’s $1000 to be a Visionary Power Brand. Only for the highly inspired!As much as we hate asking for money, it’s a sad reality of capitalism. If we want to make something new, we need the dough to make it so. But that’s why we’re going to you instead of sucking up to corporations or big investors. We are shooting to raise $15,000 to cover the costs of this campaign and finish the development of the app, which includes:
Changing the app to reflect testing feedback.
Running the app and web hosting
Campaign costs: graphic design, video production, social media marketing, website, fonts, promo materials, and community events to get the word out
Trademarks and copyright
Our stretch goals:
If we reach over $30,000, we’ll create a co-op LLC where you (yes, YOU!) literally own the game with the rest of the community.
If we reach over $50,000, we'll create an open-source brand that chooses what we want to make and sends you community-decided products (along with a political dare/mission) each month.


If we don’t reach our goal, the costs will go towards covering the campaign costs. We will reassess and see how else we can get funds to develop during testing, but the prototype WILL be completed by the end of summer.ImpactShowupia lets people take advantage of the blurred line between real and virtual to craft a new political culture in the streets and on phones simultaneously. We get it... politics blows. We’re not denying it. But in this world of crazy political theater and lives controlled by the Gram, we are adding some authenticity and humanity. Instead of trying to dismantle the system or hopeless incremental change, we are building a new system that works. The idea for Showupia was sparked in 2016 when Pokemon Go was in full force during the worst election of our lives. Sam Bonar (aka Filiblaster, Showupia's Chief Sidekick) was blown away by a silly game’s ability to start a tiny revolution. People unintentionally got off their butts, in the streets, and made community easily and spontaneously. Simply by having a location-based game where the map is the real world, people naturally interacted in new ways. So here's an AR ecosystem designed with intention to make it easy to go where it counts. This is especially powerful for people living in DC who can show up in the face of power, but have no say in national politics.This isn’t just another app owned by corporations sucking your eyeballs, data, and hard-earned cash out your pocket. This is a diy chance to play the game of power and have your voice heard as a collective roar. Become a grassroots community organizer and spontaneous activist just by exploring your city. We don’t have all the answers and we can’t predict the future. But our movement is the only one that puts you in charge. Or just come along for the ride. We are doing this IndieGoGo (before the game is ready for public release) as a way of sparking the community that will shape and eventually OWN the technology. You decide what we do with our data, what we advocate for, and which corporations we exploit. But first we need to make a killer game. For that, we need you in it: adding ideas, gifs, memes, feedback, and investing a little bit of your hard-earned cash.Other Ways You Can HelpWe know not everyone can invest in something like this. STILL REACH OUT if you want to be a part of this new country. We're not trying to take your money - we’re trying to share power and make enough money to make it worth it for you to be involved.Use the Indiegogo share tool, or share this link (igg.me/at/showupia). A new country is stronger with more citizens, so write an email or post to your followers about the new country they can help found.

The video is a crucial part of the way we experience content . The Visual Acuity Distance [1]  is 0.96 m (3.2 ft) which means you got a lot of image detail .
The best viewing distance for 24 "" FHD display is : 1.47 ft ~ 3.6 ft ( 45cm~110cm )，just match the Visual Acuity Distance.
Notes:[1] The Ideal Viewing Distance based on Visual Acuity. This distance is calculated based on the reference resolving power of the eyes. The human eye with 20/20 vision can detect or resolve details as small as 1/60th of a degree of arc. This distance represents the point beyond which some details in the picture are no longer able to be resolved, so pixels begin to blend together. Closer to the screen than this may result in the need for higher resolution display. This value should be lowered if visual acuity is worst then 20/20, raised if visual acuity is better. why resolution is 1920×1080 ?Because the console games are run Native Resolutions and Framerates under 1080p and 60FPS，the 24"" 1080p(FHD) screen DPI is the  best DPI for console games. Native Resolutions and Framerates List:Learn more from the IGN: http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/PS4_vs._Xbox_One_Native_Resolutions_and_FrameratesThe DevelopmentPONY started in a home living room in February 2016.

<p>Hello We are <b>Mero Studios</b>, A team comprised by people concerned about education and culture, besides we are video game fans.</p>
<p>A lot of people continues to believe that video games and culture are enemies, and that culture and the education can't be entertaining, a lot of people continues to believe that a videogame do not contribute with social growth at all.</p>
<p>We believe, and are sure that videogames could get be a powerful tool for cultural diffusion and they can build bridges which helps us to get closer as human beings. </p>
<p>Committed with our dreams and our cultural roots, we are developing a game named Chac mool Xec. </p>
<p>Now, Lets start with the basics:</p>
<p><b>Chac Mool:</b> It´s a mayan word , and is used to name a kind of representative statues located in the mesoamerican region, and representative of the mayan culture. </p>
<p><b>Xec:</b> It´s a peculiar mayan word which is used to denominate a fruit salad, although, used in popular terms “Xec” means Mix.</p>
<p>Chacmool Xec can be translated as “Chac mool Salad” or “Chacmool Mix Up”, and with that name you can imagine what the game is about.</p>
<p>“Chacmool Xec: A fun story with cultural Content” </p>
<p>In this Adventure the Mischief Alux <b>Niich</b> (A kind of sprite), bored and without jokes to make to the human people, decided to have fun with the chac mooles, and… ¡he has broke them all! The good <b>Tatich</b>, is a responsible alux, and warned of the importance of the chac mooles is determined to fix the damage made by his mischievous friend. But Niich will not make things easy for Tatich. Your Mission: “Help Tatich in this adventure, fixing and meeting the funny chac mooles. </p>

</div></div>","Hello We are Mero Studios, A team comprised by people concerned about education and culture, besides we are video game fans.
A lot of people continues to believe that video games and culture are enemies, and that culture and the education can't be entertaining, a lot of people continues to believe that a videogame do not contribute with social growth at all.
We believe, and are sure that videogames could get be a powerful tool for cultural diffusion and they can build bridges which helps us to get closer as human beings. 
Committed with our dreams and our cultural roots, we are developing a game named Chac mool Xec. 
Now, Lets start with the basics:
Chac Mool: It´s a mayan word , and is used to name a kind of representative statues located in the mesoamerican region, and representative of the mayan culture. 
Xec: It´s a peculiar mayan word which is used to denominate a fruit salad, although, used in popular terms “Xec” means Mix.
Chacmool Xec can be translated as “Chac mool Salad” or “Chacmool Mix Up”, and with that name you can imagine what the game is about.
“Chacmool Xec: A fun story with cultural Content” 
In this Adventure the Mischief Alux Niich (A kind of sprite), bored and without jokes to make to the human people, decided to have fun with the chac mooles, and… ¡he has broke them all! The good Tatich, is a responsible alux, and warned of the importance of the chac mooles is determined to fix the damage made by his mischievous friend. But Niich will not make things easy for Tatich. Your Mission: “Help Tatich in this adventure, fixing and meeting the funny chac mooles. 







Tatich (Alux):


Niich (Alux):



Chac-moles: > Xoxotic


 > Makataka



> Olin











We live in a in region rich in history, culture and legends,  and we noticed how day by day a part of this culture has been lost of sight or just has been lagged against the technologies, and urban growth of our city. The people just lost and still losing the contact with their roots and for this reason, our game is trying to achieve, not just the people get awareness and disseminates the mayan culture, but in a funny way, teach a part of how wonderful the history of Mesoamerica is. Our game not simply entertains, but, promotes and disseminate the Mexican Culture Values. 




We know, that participate in this movements of cultural diffusion is not an easy work, to gather and present the historical data could be exhausting. We are aware of the work we have in front  is kinda titanic, and we count on our committed team willing to spend nights without sleep just to achieve our objective and share our idea with the world.

I'm a 19 year old student from Zagreb, Croatia, pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering and computer sciences.  Since I was a little kid I was playing video games and some of the best memories of my life were made while playing games with my best friends. Since games mattered so much to us and made us bond like few other things could, I decided that, just like the people who made those games and made them mean everything to us, I wanted to create something that, hopefully, a group of freinds plays and enjoys together just like we did. So far I've made a bunch of games for PC, android and iOS, some even published on the App Store and Google Play Store, but now I would love to publish my first game on Steam using it's Greenlight program.</p>

</div></div>","My Story Hi. I'm a 19 year old student from Zagreb, Croatia, pursuing a bachelor's degree in engineering and computer sciences.  Since I was a little kid I was playing video games and some of the best memories of my life were made while playing games with my best friends. Since games mattered so much to us and made us bond like few other things could, I decided that, just like the people who made those games and made them mean everything to us, I wanted to create something that, hopefully, a group of freinds plays and enjoys together just like we did. So far I've made a bunch of games for PC, android and iOS, some even published on the App Store and Google Play Store, but now I would love to publish my first game on Steam using it's Greenlight program.




About the game

In ""During The Search"" you play as a guy who is looking for his best friend in the middle of a zombie outbreak. While he's searching for her, he has to evade zombies, help injured people and wonder around in the dark with just a flashlight. In the end, he finds her, but it's too late, she gets infected right infront of his eyes. He decides that life is just to cruel and gives up on everything...almost...





What I need

In order to reach my goal I need to pay a 100$ submission fee to get my game onto Steam's Greenlight program. Since the minimum amount a campaign can be started with is 500$, whatever money i have left I will use to buy additional assets and donate some of it to other developers that need to pay the same sum

The one who is to save all of Pomenia is already on the way and before the grand arrival the fairies need to get dressed in magical, wonderful outfits. There are always some difficulties when dealing with magical creatures and so this task is not quite as simple as you might think. The fairies see each day as the birthday of a new day and that means every one of them wants to choose their own perfect outfit. The only way to know which outfit best is to test them in action. The right combination will be great to fly in and feel just right.</p><p>Time does not exist in Pomenia, there is just magic. Creativity and will are the very best characteristic of all magical creatures: fairies, children, and the rest. We should do all we can to preserve that. So, let’s help the fairies get dressed up and find what makes them feel uniquely themselves. Adventures await!</p><p>Without further ado, fairytale folk and everyone gathered around! Please let us introduce the seven fairies of Pomenia! Or perhaps eight, or nine if you count carefully. Here are the sassy and spicy, colourful, and characterful fairies: <strong><i>Scarlet Sunrise, Dahlia Daydreamer, Shamrock Shady, Marigold Merry, Fuchsia Fantastic, Lilac Lovely, Saphron Sparkle and Sinopia Surly</i></strong>! </p><p>You may have noticed that Shamrock is still hiding? Shamrock is called Shady for a reason and prefers the magic of sunshine spotted through a canopy of leaves than a bright spotlight. But Shady Shamrock loves dress-up games just as much as his fairy sisters do. I have an idea! Let’s all whisper that it is perfectly fine for Shamrock to join the fun. Dressing up in all the colours of the rainbow, crowns and boots, wands and waggly tails is allowed for all adventurers and being silly is the best part of any day!</p><p>PS. Shamrock is amazing, by the way. He loves everything green and especially if it has dash and shine to it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520983633/yyvu3fvk7qcwvws3dq3c.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/2uvZAxOdIFoIir9jFS/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><ul>

<p>Pomenia is the creation of fairytale artist, founder of children’s clothing brand Tinttu.com and long-time entrepreneur Petronella Grahn. Petronella emphasises the meaning of stories and imagination in a child’s life and development. She is an advocate for a child’s right to be childishly playful and creative.</p>
</div><p>She first introduced her fairytale world to the public through the Tinttu.com children’s fashion collection and kept the stories of Pomenia to herself, for over twenty years. Petronella has shared the tales of the Fairy Dreamland<i> </i>with her six children as wonderful bedtime stories, teaching them important lessons and creating magical games.</p><p>Petronella wanted to bring forth the fairytale world that all her creativity was based on, but she was waiting for courage to take that leap of faith and the time never seemed right to share the stories until in 2015 when she met co-founder Stephanie Sinclair Lappi. </p><p>Petronella and Stephanie shared the same values of upbringing children in a colourful world of play, imagination, dreaming, and stories. When they started to plan a partnership, they noticed they also shared a strong work ethic, believing in what they could create with the ability to see wonderfully big things happen and by constantly teaching themselves new things.</p><p>Pomenia is a unique company in the mobile app/game space, with management consisting of two strong Scandinavian women. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6mGfYUJNI0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520983763/lwhlmmuzdyfqpz3pyxnm.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520938059/z2f1cukj2ymfupcs5rlx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><i>""If you want your child to see a dragon, tell your child about dragons.

The one who is to save all of Pomenia is already on the way and before the grand arrival the fairies need to get dressed in magical, wonderful outfits. There are always some difficulties when dealing with magical creatures and so this task is not quite as simple as you might think. The fairies see each day as the birthday of a new day and that means every one of them wants to choose their own perfect outfit. The only way to know which outfit best is to test them in action. The right combination will be great to fly in and feel just right.Time does not exist in Pomenia, there is just magic. Creativity and will are the very best characteristic of all magical creatures: fairies, children, and the rest. We should do all we can to preserve that. So, let’s help the fairies get dressed up and find what makes them feel uniquely themselves. Adventures await!Without further ado, fairytale folk and everyone gathered around! Please let us introduce the seven fairies of Pomenia! Or perhaps eight, or nine if you count carefully. Here are the sassy and spicy, colourful, and characterful fairies: Scarlet Sunrise, Dahlia Daydreamer, Shamrock Shady, Marigold Merry, Fuchsia Fantastic, Lilac Lovely, Saphron Sparkle and Sinopia Surly! You may have noticed that Shamrock is still hiding? Shamrock is called Shady for a reason and prefers the magic of sunshine spotted through a canopy of leaves than a bright spotlight. But Shady Shamrock loves dress-up games just as much as his fairy sisters do. I have an idea! Let’s all whisper that it is perfectly fine for Shamrock to join the fun. Dressing up in all the colours of the rainbow, crowns and boots, wands and waggly tails is allowed for all adventurers and being silly is the best part of any day!PS. Shamrock is amazing, by the way. He loves everything green and especially if it has dash and shine to it.

Fairy dust, fairy dust, and more fairy dust!Supported OS's: Apple iOS: 10 & 11Android: 5.0 & 5.1 Lollipop, 6.0 Marshmallow, 7.0 Nougat, 8.0 & 8.1 Oreo    In Pomenia, the adventures of trolls and dragons, unicorns and fairies take you to a place that you have only dreamed about, perhaps a long time ago.Pomenia is the exciting story of a unique little boy who is swept away by magic. One morning, the little boy wakes up in his bed in the middle of fairy dreamland Pomenia, and he has been transformed into a cute little troll. Soon audacious adventures await him, together with a kind dragon who fears flying! The duo must save Pomenia from eternal winter and coldness, which Spite McGnarly loves and cherishes. Magic fairy dust is urgently needed – a lot of magic dairy dust. Luckily, they do not need to survive alone in any of their daunting endeavors, because in Pomenia all creatures – great and small, from beetles to fairies – help each other, always. In Pomenia good and evil battle, yet no evil is so great that a small child would have difficulty facing it.  Conquering fear, using courage and collaboration help to achieve new surprising skills. The dramatically exciting story teaches that the most important thing we learn is the courage to be true to yourself. Be yourself, no matter who you are: whether you are Spite McGnarly, a dragon who fears flying, a fairy who loves beauty and goodness, or even a small, frizzly-haired troll.The challenges the characters of the story confront are the same that children face every day, everywhere in the world. Finding one's inner strengths, respecting the differences of others and working together are all essential – regardless of your age, gender, or background.Pomenia speaks of kindness, adventure, courage, joy, and magic. Themes which affect people around the world. Themes we value and treasure. Themes which affect people around the world.   “We will do something”, Lily Dragon promised. “Let’s ask for help. Monsieur Mouse and Lily were all set to go. Mouse placed his tiny paws ceremoniously against Lily Dragon’s grand paws and together they yelled as loud as they could: “one, two, three HELP!!!!”This campaign is vital to us. By supporting our work, you will enable the mobile game adventures to be finalised and the story animated with graphics, voice actors, and music.We are adding exclusive and unique features to the fairytale adventure game to engage adventurers of all ages. We have calculated the production costs for the mobile game and believe them to be highly accurate.A successfully funded campaign will save the world of Pomenia and open the doors to an unseen fairy dreamland!         If our campaign is supported over our expectations we will use the additional funding for a Pomenia storybook, both in English and in Finnish. The storybook has been distributed for feedback within the Pomenia community and the response has been encouraging.”Our kids jumped into the world of Pomenia right from the first page. The story is captivating, carrying you through Posy Meadow to wild adventures. There are many wonderful characters and the scenes are very lively.As a parent, I think the best thing about the story is that it shows both sides of characters. Nobody is completely evil, everyone has their own story and perspective. And I loved how our children adopted the characters into their own imaginative play. They like the fairy Sinopia Surly and the wicked warlock Spite McGnarly the most.At bedtime, we often talk about why certain things happen. Reading the story and talking about the events has been an enriching experience for us, brought me closer to my kids.”Jukka, father of seven-year-old and eight-year-old.   

 
The risks involved in creating the mobile game have to do with managing resources, such as the available funds and working closely with the coding and graphic design team so that the project is completed on time and on budget.
We have been running an online business offering children's products for over a decade and we have a good network of reliable partners with whom we have been working with for many years already.Finland has an exceptional level of expertise in creating mobile games. After careful selection, we are outsourcing the technical game development to Finnish Kyy Games Ltd, who is an award-winning and trusted partner.
 
 
 


Pomenia is the creation of fairytale artist, founder of children’s clothing brand Tinttu.com and long-time entrepreneur Petronella Grahn. Petronella emphasises the meaning of stories and imagination in a child’s life and development. She is an advocate for a child’s right to be childishly playful and creative.
She first introduced her fairytale world to the public through the Tinttu.com children’s fashion collection and kept the stories of Pomenia to herself, for over twenty years. Petronella has shared the tales of the Fairy Dreamland with her six children as wonderful bedtime stories, teaching them important lessons and creating magical games.Petronella wanted to bring forth the fairytale world that all her creativity was based on, but she was waiting for courage to take that leap of faith and the time never seemed right to share the stories until in 2015 when she met co-founder Stephanie Sinclair Lappi. Petronella and Stephanie shared the same values of upbringing children in a colourful world of play, imagination, dreaming, and stories. When they started to plan a partnership, they noticed they also shared a strong work ethic, believing in what they could create with the ability to see wonderfully big things happen and by constantly teaching themselves new things.Pomenia is a unique company in the mobile app/game space, with management consisting of two strong Scandinavian women.        ""If you want your child to see a dragon, tell your child about dragons. Tell about the velvety scales, how they move as the dragon breathes in and out-and the child takes an easy breath in and out""Petronella Grahn imagined the Fairy Dreamland of Pomenia for her own six children. She creates all the enchanting fairytale art and stories of Pomenia and is in charge of the vision and direction of Pomenia. Petronella oversees the mobile game creation and animation. She is a fairytailor and an interior designer, creating the products for Pomenia Design by Fairytale Artist Petronella with over twenty years of experience in merchandising and online commerce. As the founder and long-time successful entrepreneur of children’s clothing and interior design company Tinttu.com Petronella Grahn has the skills and experience to create exceptional ventures.  Stephanie Sinclair Lappi manages the international networks, negotiations, and operations of Pomenia. She speaks fluent Finnish, Fairy and English and is busy turning the fairy dreamland of Pomenia into enchanted English. Stephanie Sinclair Lappi took her first three-person company from Finland to the New York Nasdaq stock exchange and is looking forward to building Pomenia together with Petronella Grahn. In Pomenia Stephanie Sinclair Lappi is in charge of magical operations and escapades. She is a map maker, a courageous adventurer and director of good news. Pomenia wants to tell stories through various channels. Children and families need to be approached where children are in 2018 and this means bringing the fairytale world to virtual formats such as mobile apps, and downloadable music. We are not forgetting traditional channels but offering mobile apps alongside board games and animated stories and video books alongside traditional storybooks. Our guiding principle is to bring options to the international children’s market that are carefully thought out, with a strong value base and child-sensitive content without compromising imagination, adventure, and creativity.It was natural that the first of eight apps to be published from Pomenia was the Fairy Dress Up app. Petronella Grahn is the creator and designer behind all the magical clothing and fairytale forest hats in her own children’s clothing brand Tinttu.com. One big, wonderful dress-up game for all children! Bunnies and foxes, dragons, and fairies… Every child has the right to be the creative, playful, and imaginative being that they truly are. This has been the life mission of Petronella. Those childhood dressing up apps were the very beginning of Tinttu.com and of this mobile app.The world of Pomenia is intended to be shared, as all magical things are. Petronella Grahn has said “Welcome” to everything Pomenia brings as that is what anyone entering Pomenia hears on their arrival. ”Give a child the gift of imagination and enthusiasm, to soar through life”-Petronella",27.0,1,"1 Campaign

What’s a Royal Commission?A Royal Commission is a select group of people appointed by the Government to investigate a matter of important public concern and to make recommendations on any actions to be taken. It has been used to tackle areas of controversy that are politically difficult, so hard decisions can be taken in the sake of the national good.For example, the 1991 Royal Commission on Criminal Justice heard from over 600 groups and individuals, commissioned 22 pieces of research - and led to the 1995 Criminal Appeal Act and the creation of the Criminal Cases Review Commission.A Royal Commission can make objective, non-political recommendations which will be the starting point of a new partnership between patients, public and professionals to work with politicians and form an NHS for the future.The goalposts can’t keep moving every 5 years!We have to take a new and more open approach.Once a Commission reports, the onus is then on the Government of the day to explain fully why they wouldn’t choose to participate in this process, why they would deviate from any recommendations, and on NHS staff and respective unions to do the same.This would transform our NHS but in a more sustainable way - ensuring it is kept available for all.

Technology has taken over society. People connect with one another through email, social media updates, text messaging, etc. Human contact and adventure in the great outdoors have taken a back seat in many people's lives. But, that's about to change with Ripler. This revolutionary app will encourage people to rediscover the world around them as they explore their way to world domination. A project this large needs help from the crowdfunding community. That's why we've launched an IndieGoGo campaign to raise $25,000. Funds received will help us complete the free app and make it available for everyone to enjoy on iOS and Android devices.Press coverage...


Here's how it works










Give us your name, or make up a new one! Either way, we'll use a little code to convert your name into a unique colour.





Go exploring to expand your riple. Wether you're climbing a mountain, riding a wave or just commuting: Every step you take makes you bigger in Ripler.







Trainer bots show you how to defeat other players. Recruit or destroy players to keep moving forward.

<p>Here's how Ember fits into the magical world of gaming...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Multiple ways to play: Ember </b>has a variety of different ways to play based on your play-style. Casual Play, Hardcore, or even Battle Mode.</li>
<li>A game of <b>Ember </b>scales based on the number of players; more players equals more creatures which equals more options and strategies.</li>
<li>Plays with 2 to 5 players (best with 4 or 5).</li>
<li>Fantastic <b>Solo Play</b> mode available (with unique <b>Spell </b>cards).</li>
<li>
<b>8+ Group Play: </b>Purchase a second <b>Core Set </b>to allow 8 or even 10 to play <b>Ember </b>at the same time. Double the players means double the monsters - no two games will ever be the same! </li>
<li>The perfect intro game for all the family, based on tried-and-tested mechanics from one of the world's most popular card games. This really is a game you can play with your kids, and they LOVE IT (it's one part <b>Pokemon</b>, one part deck-building game, and one part - take that! - explosive strategy). There are few games out there that scale as well for players of all ages.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Ember is a strategic card game set in a fantasy world of elemental magic. Players collect cards to form “sets” that they cash in to conjure mythical creatures which they can use to boost their abilities or hinder their opponents. It's a race to the finish as the wizards seek glory by collecting the rarest and most powerful creatures.With Solo Play and a slew of different play modes, Ember really is fantastic value.Ember is already at the printers and scheduled for a June 2016 launch!Summary: You get 112 high quality cards all for the bargain price of £13.












Here's how Ember fits into the magical world of gaming...


Multiple ways to play: Ember has a variety of different ways to play based on your play-style. Casual Play, Hardcore, or even Battle Mode.
A game of Ember scales based on the number of players; more players equals more creatures which equals more options and strategies.
Plays with 2 to 5 players (best with 4 or 5).
Fantastic Solo Play mode available (with unique Spell cards).

8+ Group Play: Purchase a second Core Set to allow 8 or even 10 to play Ember at the same time. Double the players means double the monsters - no two games will ever be the same! 
The perfect intro game for all the family, based on tried-and-tested mechanics from one of the world's most popular card games. This really is a game you can play with your kids, and they LOVE IT (it's one part Pokemon, one part deck-building game, and one part - take that! - explosive strategy). There are few games out there that scale as well for players of all ages.











Intro Game: Ember is a simple game with lots of depth. You can teach it to just about anyone. It's the perfect light intro game you can play before, after, or even during those heavier games. 

Many Ways to Play: With a bunch of ways to play, Ember is fantastic value. Try Casual, Hardcore, and Solo modes.

Replayability: Ember is a simple game that we still find ourselves enjoying and playing after hundreds of games. 

Simple Setup: Set up the pool of creatures according to their Victory Point (VP) score, shuffle the play deck, deal five cards to each player, and play. It's that simple!

Fast-Paced: It's a fast, bright and colourful card game; the base game only takes about 20 to 30 minutes to play (Hardcore takes about 15).

To get a magical overview of the game, check out Ember’s rules.  









You're getting a great deal! This version of Ember won't ever be released in shops (via a worldwide distribution deal).
You're supporting a UK game developer.
We need your help getting Ember made. The more people who pledge, the more stretch goals we can include, making the game better for everyone! 

Ember has proven to be exceptionally popular with younger gamers - this really is the perfect game to play with your kids - or your partner (who we know hates games - this could be the one that tips the scales and finally gets them interested). Hey. It could happen.
If you like magical spells and mythical creatures - Ember is for you.
If you like variants of traditional card games then you have to buy this game!

Ember came third on the SmarterBacker Badger Index. A great feat considering the competition it had that week. This absolutely is a seal (well, badger) of quality.

Why flexible?Flexible campaign has been chosen as the work on the game is launched at full length, but your help can speed up the development, improve it in all the aspects and will allow to release the game as soon as possible.

“What am I investing into?” is the question you’ll ask. All the money will be put into the development of the game, which includes:

Employing people on full-time basis
Voice-overs, soundtrack and work on sound effects
Localization in English, French and Russian languages
Purchase of all the required software
Miscellaneous
Taxes
The sooner we raise money, the sooner we can hire additional staff which will directly accelerate development of the game.Morrain is a prison island, located to the north of the mainland, where the action of the game takes place. For more than 300 years, criminals from all corners of the Empire have been taken here. Lately, unsettling reports about the outbreak of an unknown disease started to arrive.As it also turned out, all the prisoners escaped from the prison and dispersed around the island.The protagonist is a combat medic. He comes to the island as a member of the medical corps to investigate and prevent the spread of the mysterious disease, which has taken lives of lots and lots of people.Imperial Secret Expedition (ISE). ISE agents arrived on the island, cordoned it off and declared it a quarantine zone, blocking all the communication with the mainland. The purpose of their arrival is unclear as disease elimination doesn’t come under the jurisdiction of ISE.The Church. They have been treating the disease before the arrival of the medical corps and ISE agents until the situation ran rampant (has taken alarming dimensions). The church is dissatisfied with the arrival and intervention of the medical corps and ISE.Different gangs.  A mob called together from all the corners of the Empire. They try to survive in this inhospitable climate, struggling against hostile environment and government agents. They scattered around the island and have a dream of taking control of the island, and better still – escaping from it. The mob is divided into various groups, depending on the blocks they were kept in.Character progressionThere are no skill points or level ups. Our system of skills’ improvement directly depends on the way you use those skills. For example, to run faster and expend less energy you simply need to run more often. At the key levels of skills’ development there open traits which add these or those passive bonuses. Variations of the plot and quests: In Morrain, there are several endings of the game. All of them depend on decisions and actions of a player, made during the gameplay. It refers not only to the main story line, but also to additional quests.There are no fedex quests and quests of «Kill 10 rats and now kill 10 stronger rats» kind. All the quests contribute to the unfolding of the plot and give some information about the world of the game. Enemy AIWe will try to make Enemy AI in such a way that the pattern of his behavior won’t be too predictable for a player. This means that enemies will flank the character if they are in groups, use various bombs and pistols, run to the safe passing distance, hide behind the backs of a companion in case they were injured. And it’s not the end! Dangers and survival methods:Apart from gangs and wild animals, hostile environment, diseases, supercooling, famine, exhaustion, uncured wounds, intoxications pose hazards to the life of the protagonist.                                           Diseases: Diseases in Morrain are common ones, but can be fatal. The character can contract a disease from cold weather, bites of wild animals, uncured wounds, raw meat and unknown plants. These diseases start with symptoms, and then, in the course of time, impair health and skills of a player. The player has to determine the diagnosis according to symptoms and cure himself, and if he doesn’t do that in time, the progressing disease will definitely lead to death.                                           Medicaments: the player can resist all the calamities, making and using various serums and drugs. But you should be careful with what and how you treat that. Drugs have side effects and lots of them are addictive, so you need to take them sensibly.                                                     Negative effects: Negatives effects can temporary and permanent. Temporary effects such as tiredness, famine, sickness and others are cured with the rest, food and medicines. But the character can suffer from the consequences of severe wounds and drug addiction in the whole course of the game.                                         Apart from physical wounds, the character can get moral injuries. For example, if you “feast” your eyes with corpses for a loooong time, it might have bad consequences.                                                           In addition to that, you can get addicted to eating human meat. Yes, yes, you read that right, there’s too little food on the island.                                         Music and immersion devices.Music has great significance in the game, as it, along with the visuals and gameplay, creates the atmosphere and helps to plunge into the game deeper. And because of that, for every single type of location and for specific events there has been written a suitable soundtrack. Here’s one example of that:Why do we need your help?Our project is rather big and is made by common efforts of 5 people:
Game/level designer - Maxim Sidash
Programmer - Alexander Trefilov
3D Artist –Characters/Animation - Sergei Suharev
3D Artist – Objects/Architecture - Ivan Reznik
Composer - Andrey Grebenyuk
As we have minimum working staff, we have chosen flexible. We need money for:
English VO. The game needs memorable, charismatic voices
Localization in three languages: English, French and Russian
Development and additional staff. We need two artists for locations, objects and characters, two 3D artists for object modeling and animation
Rewards


RisksWhat happens if we don’t raise enough money?Don’t panic, guys! We’ll release the game anyways, even if it requires selling our programmer’s kidney…or two! But your help will make it better in all the aspects and we’ll finally have a chance to eat.When will the game be released? It directly depends on the amount of raised funds. If we raise 10 000 dollars, the development of the game will take a little longer than if we get the budget of a small country. We do our best to release it as soon as possible (and to let our programmer enjoy life with the whole set of organs) and to make players enjoy the game. On our projects’ page (see links below) we will systematically post new information, art and video about the things we have done and we are working on at the moment.Stay tuned, folks!Join us!Even if you cannot donate money (that makes us sad, especially our programmer (greedy bastard doesn’t want to sell his kidney!!!)) , tell your friends about us. The more support we get the faster and better we’ll make out project work. Any help, in any form of it is highly important to us, whether it’s your money, love or hugs!Thank you for supporting us!Morrain Dev Team",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>I am Errol Doris Sr...</h3>
<p>One of the early pioneers of Digital Printing, that launched one of the First Billboard Printers into the USA, Central and South America markets. I also developed <strong>VideoShopper</strong>, the first Digital Video Movie Rental Club in Supermarkets and Variety stores. In 2000, we launched the BEL2000, the first Large Format, Hi-Res, High-Speed Digital Printer for the Packaging and Display Industries.</p>
<p>In short, I built my career as a Pioneering Digital guru.</p>
<p>I also worked in the Retail Industry and developed printing methods to Sell and Promote famous movies like <strong>Top Gun</strong>, <strong>Crocodile Dundee</strong>, <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong> and many others, in Bookstores, Drugstores, Department stores. I also pioneered Big Auto Show graphics and Exhibit Systems for the NFL.</p>
<p>I am a game designer and produced board games in-store retail and incentive Games and Promotions for Wal-Mart and Citicorp Retail Services.</p>
<p><strong>Brandoodles</strong> is a first-of-a kind Game that transitioned from a simple<strong> <u>Hangman style paper game</u></strong>, to a <strong><u>Parlor Board Game</u></strong> to a <strong><u>Cash Register game</u></strong>, to a <strong><u>Mobile Game</u></strong> and now a <strong><u>Digital Game Show</u></strong> that will be streamed 24 hours a day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482428255/ywtfnqw4rb9vtxwwo7ac.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482430753/jaiseu54nzqfwwep9kiv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Brandoodles</strong> is the first and only game with a format similar to Wheel-of-Fortune game, that has never been exploited. Wheel-of-Fortune players are natural <strong>Brandoodles</strong> Players...with a new format for a 24/7 audience that gives them real skin in the game by being able to go online and redeem the prize they won.</p>
<p>Best of all everyone that plays <strong>Brandoodles</strong> is a Winner. The size of the win varies only by discount (10% - 99%) and based on one's ""agility"" to login the fastest... to win the highest discounts.</p>
<p>By first engaging Retailers and Advertisers who have under utilized the power of the Cash Register Front face,  and with only a tiny arsenal of 100 advertised product Brands...used as the game puzzles...displayed for as little as 91 days in 1,000 stores, we are poised to generate  half a billion dollars in gross revenue by charging the lowest ever digital ad rate at $0.005 per click.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482430479/mw8aiwa8mwqiulvoftc8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Brandoodles</strong> was first developed in the 1990's as a <strong>Hangman Style Supermarket Trivia Game</strong>. Customers would play the game by filling in the missing letters of Famous Brands on pieces of paper and they would win those brands as prizes. Most of them played the game with high excitement, but the technology only existed with coupons and was not wide reaching enough to catch on nationally.</p>
<p>By 2015, the advent of Mobile Technology opened the doors to being able to expose <strong>Brandoodles</strong> nationally to over 230 million people who participate in game play every day. The key to ""winning"" is to redeem the Cash Register ""prize"" as a big discount (10% - 99%) for products that may not even be sold in the store they visited. This concept opens the crossover advertising flood gates to every one of the 4.5 million locations with Cash Registers. With mobile redemption each customer will gain access to hundreds of other products offering Big Discounts without first spending a dime.</p>
<p>Imagine the obvious...being able to get a big discount off of a pair of expensive shoes from a <strong>Drugstore Cash Register receipt</strong>, or a deep discount off of a Ford Automobile from a <strong>Hardware Store Cash Register receipt</strong> or a Household Appliance off of the <strong>Cash Register receipt of a McDonald's restaurant</strong>. The possibilities are endless. This is not a Groupon-type ""push"" strategy. This is Brandoodles ""pull"" strategy. Everyone is bound to be a winner with no obligation to spend anything.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482433745/xkwbjswdknvlkjr4u9pg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Big Idea and Big Reward</strong></h3>
<p>We are the first to market this concept with Patent Pending protection. </p>
<p>We are launching this unheard of phenomenon at the highest retail level stores to the lowest. In fact. Wherever there is a Cash Register, there is an Advertising Opportunity. So it does not matter the hierarchy of the Retailer. Everyone is fair game. The last and only time a phenomenon like this was launched was during the S&amp;H Green Stamps era that lasted over 50 years.</p>
<p>Our confidence of success is high. Why? The average big retailer houses 35,000 - 45,000 products and many of the smart ones have offered online sales. Yet, there are over 500,000 products that never see the light of day sitting alone in their warehouses. By promoting 1,000,000 clicks for $0.005 per click, the possibility of exponentially increasing the revenue stream is ""huge"" beyond belief, using an existing technology that cannot be replaced with ""Mobile Cash"" for close to a decade from now.</p>
<p>You will be funding a new and unique category of Retail Advertising and Marketing through Game Play. See us at <a href=""http://belcomcorp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://belcomcorp.com</a></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $25,000 to get the project to the next step which is <u><strong>to complete the algorithm and implement the website</strong></u>. Why so little you may ask?

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk we have is being late to market. The challenge we face is not being able to fund this properly in the long run. Most of what was stated before encompasses our S.W.O.T analysis:</p>
<p><u><strong>STRENGTH</strong></u>:  Patents Pending for the Use, Apparatus and Methods to promote brands to reach potentially 60 million people a day.</p>
<p><b><u>WEAKNESS</u></b>: Lack of Funding to fully implement the project.</p>
<p><strong><u>OPPORTUNITY</u></strong>: Access to 4.5 million potential Retail Partners.</p>
<p><u><strong>THREATS</strong></u>: Delays that could prevent being First-to-Market.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If it not possible to provide funding, could you please help us spread the word in your Social Media circles? We would be forever grateful for that. </p>
<p>We believe that word-of-mouth and casual networking could help to propel this project to success.</p>

</div></div>","I am Errol Doris Sr...
One of the early pioneers of Digital Printing, that launched one of the First Billboard Printers into the USA, Central and South America markets. I also developed VideoShopper, the first Digital Video Movie Rental Club in Supermarkets and Variety stores. In 2000, we launched the BEL2000, the first Large Format, Hi-Res, High-Speed Digital Printer for the Packaging and Display Industries.
In short, I built my career as a Pioneering Digital guru.
I also worked in the Retail Industry and developed printing methods to Sell and Promote famous movies like Top Gun, Crocodile Dundee, Lady and the Tramp and many others, in Bookstores, Drugstores, Department stores. I also pioneered Big Auto Show graphics and Exhibit Systems for the NFL.
I am a game designer and produced board games in-store retail and incentive Games and Promotions for Wal-Mart and Citicorp Retail Services.
Brandoodles is a first-of-a kind Game that transitioned from a simple Hangman style paper game, to a Parlor Board Game to a Cash Register game, to a Mobile Game and now a Digital Game Show that will be streamed 24 hours a day.
 

 

 
Brandoodles is the first and only game with a format similar to Wheel-of-Fortune game, that has never been exploited. Wheel-of-Fortune players are natural Brandoodles Players...with a new format for a 24/7 audience that gives them real skin in the game by being able to go online and redeem the prize they won.
Best of all everyone that plays Brandoodles is a Winner. The size of the win varies only by discount (10% - 99%) and based on one's ""agility"" to login the fastest... to win the highest discounts.
By first engaging Retailers and Advertisers who have under utilized the power of the Cash Register Front face,  and with only a tiny arsenal of 100 advertised product Brands...used as the game puzzles...displayed for as little as 91 days in 1,000 stores, we are poised to generate  half a billion dollars in gross revenue by charging the lowest ever digital ad rate at $0.005 per click.

Brandoodles was first developed in the 1990's as a Hangman Style Supermarket Trivia Game. Customers would play the game by filling in the missing letters of Famous Brands on pieces of paper and they would win those brands as prizes. Most of them played the game with high excitement, but the technology only existed with coupons and was not wide reaching enough to catch on nationally.
By 2015, the advent of Mobile Technology opened the doors to being able to expose Brandoodles nationally to over 230 million people who participate in game play every day. The key to ""winning"" is to redeem the Cash Register ""prize"" as a big discount (10% - 99%) for products that may not even be sold in the store they visited. This concept opens the crossover advertising flood gates to every one of the 4.5 million locations with Cash Registers. With mobile redemption each customer will gain access to hundreds of other products offering Big Discounts without first spending a dime.
Imagine the obvious...being able to get a big discount off of a pair of expensive shoes from a Drugstore Cash Register receipt, or a deep discount off of a Ford Automobile from a Hardware Store Cash Register receipt or a Household Appliance off of the Cash Register receipt of a McDonald's restaurant. The possibilities are endless. This is not a Groupon-type ""push"" strategy. This is Brandoodles ""pull"" strategy. Everyone is bound to be a winner with no obligation to spend anything.  

 
Big Idea and Big Reward
We are the first to market this concept with Patent Pending protection. 
We are launching this unheard of phenomenon at the highest retail level stores to the lowest. In fact. Wherever there is a Cash Register, there is an Advertising Opportunity. So it does not matter the hierarchy of the Retailer. Everyone is fair game. The last and only time a phenomenon like this was launched was during the S&H Green Stamps era that lasted over 50 years.
Our confidence of success is high. Why? The average big retailer houses 35,000 - 45,000 products and many of the smart ones have offered online sales. Yet, there are over 500,000 products that never see the light of day sitting alone in their warehouses. By promoting 1,000,000 clicks for $0.005 per click, the possibility of exponentially increasing the revenue stream is ""huge"" beyond belief, using an existing technology that cannot be replaced with ""Mobile Cash"" for close to a decade from now.
You will be funding a new and unique category of Retail Advertising and Marketing through Game Play. See us at http://belcomcorp.com

What We Need & What You Get
We need a minimum of $25,000 to get the project to the next step which is to complete the algorithm and implement the website. Why so little you may ask? We are professional graphic artists, game development specialists, sales professionals, marketers and finance people. See http://belcomcorp.com/our-team/. We have operated this project on a shoe string budget from day one. We are all invested in making this project a success and have spent from our own resources to get it to this point.
We are so confident of the success of this project that in our business plan, a revenue stream will develop within the first three months post implementation. Once that occurs, we will initiate the working budget to encompass the new sales and tech staff we will need to run the operation.
Perks
We will honor each backer with a Limited Certificate of Appreciation that will be signed and numbered by me, the Founder, Developer and CEO.
I will also provide a specially designed Brandoodles Tee Shirt that will be limited only to backers of this project.

I am also a Artist and I have prepared a selection of a Limited Edition of Signed and numbered Pop Art Lithographs for each backer at their respective levels. The originals of these Lithographs have never been seen before and will only be available to backers.
If we do not reach the entire goal we will continue to fund the project from our own pockets, as we have been doing. We are confident in the success of this project and need just a little push uphill to get it to start to gather steam as it rolls along the path to victory!

Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk we have is being late to market. The challenge we face is not being able to fund this properly in the long run. Most of what was stated before encompasses our S.W.O.T analysis:
STRENGTH:  Patents Pending for the Use, Apparatus and Methods to promote brands to reach potentially 60 million people a day.

THREATS: Delays that could prevent being First-to-Market.

<h3>So where are we right now?!</h3>
<p>Today is: August 19. 2016<br/>We are not a startup company. Our company exists since 1992 and has his roots in advertising and printing. So we already earn our hamburger. Meaning: The support you will give us will be used to develop the project.<br/>The concept of the GAME2ART and COMIC2ART website is a new project which we are REALLY very enthousiastic about.<br/><strong>The website</strong> is - at this moment - being built and our technicians are solving all the technical issues that run behind the scenes of our website/platform.<br/><strong>The productrange</strong> has been created and everything has been checked and tested, so there is no issue with producing perks or shipping them. This comes forward out of our daily business as is.<br/><strong>Partnerships</strong> within the games and comics industry have been realised with Ronimo Games and ComicWatch. With this content we will build our first productrange for the website. We are negotiating with other partners already and we are open for any other to come forward!<br/><strong>Productdesign</strong> is being done on a daily bases. The perks you see here are the first products (now) ready for production. Of course there will be much more items, but what that will be is our little secret right now.<br/>.... for more (newer) information check the updates tab on this page.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>The first goal:</strong></p>
<p>Our first goal is set at $ 10.000<br/>Reaching this goal would help us refine our shopdevelopment and extend to one more partner. Covering the costs of additional productdevelopment, more coding and some extra online marketing.</p>
<p>This being a world-wide platform for countless games and comics our stretchgoals can be endless. If well embraced this 'Thing' could be 'Huge' if many of you would kindly support it.</p>
<p>Stretching to $ 25.000<br/>would help us to create more buzz, hiring marketing professionals and adding more content</p>
<p>Stretching to $ 50.000<br/>would help us to take part at the next large games-fair and develop more products</p>
<p>Stretching to $ 100.000<br/>would help us to create a new job, enlarging our team, giving us more power to service you</p>
<p>Stretching beyond $ 100.000<br/>is at this point more then we could hope for but feel free to help us crack this as well.<br/>We would like to create one very large platform for you to find whatever you need when it comes to merchandise of your favourite game or comic. Cracking this level would mean that we could even become more of a platform offering more interesting content and services.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Will the world change if this gets funded? YES!<br/>At this point there is no-one taking good care of all the games and comics merchandising issues in a way we would. No one is offering a platform to which gamesdevelopers and comicspublishers can connect to. The cooperation-principle we offer gives more possibilities to developers and publishers to go 'live' with nice merchandise. Developers and publishers are missing out on great opportunities and fans are missing out on merchandise they would love to order.</p>
<p>With game2art.com and comic2art.com we offer a service to both parties. With our high-end service of developing and producing the merchandise-items as well as selling it to the end-user we create a platform that will fullfill.<br/> </p>

        Super Mixtape has been in development since February 2015 and has gone through multiple iterations before reaching this point. A 'Feature Rich' prototype level of the game was shown to the public at EuroGamer (EGX) September 2015 in Birmingham, UK, on a double wide booth, and was extremely well received.

<h3>
        Gameplay
    </h3>
<p>
<i>“Throughout the design and construction of the game I have spent a lot of time thinking about the unique mechanics and elements of the game that create the overall experience.”</i>
</p>
<p>
        As you progress through the game, your aim as a player is to traverse 'Mix' across the musical landscape to collect keys and unlock doors, allowing you to progress through the beat.
    </p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
            Mechanics, physics and rules of 'Mix'
        </h3>
<br/>
<i>""Within Super Mixtape, from the beginning, I wanted the main character 'Mix' to behave like a physical cassette and have some basic 'rules'""</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
            You can only move when your magnetic strip is touching the ground
        </li>
<li>
            You can jump from the left wheel (Left Trigger) or the right wheel 
            (Right Trigger) allowing the cassette to jump and behave differently within the physics, giving you more distance or height.
        </li>
<li>
            When you flip onto the B-Side, the amount of spooled tape is reversed.
        </li>
</ul>

<br/>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
                The Flip:
            </em>
</strong> 
        One of the core mechanics in Super Mixtape, allowing you to flip the world and play backwards through the game with a whole new audio sequence to progress with. The foreground denotes the active side, and the background is the opposite side of the track. The combination of the two sides will help you progress through the game and solve the puzzles.
    </p>
<p>
        ""If you're one minute into the A-side on a cassette tape, then flip the tape, you have one minute left on the B-Side"".

<strong>
<em>
                The Jumps &amp; Physics:
            </em>
</strong> 
        Another Core-Mechanic in Super Mixtape is the way you jump from either the left side or the right side of the cassette, depending on which trigger/wheel you use to propel yourself into the air. Jumping from the left will make the tape rotate slightly to the right and vice versa when jumping from the right, the tape will rotate to the left. This allows the player to gain either distance or height when moving, 
and allows for 'Tricks' to be completed when combined with the 'tumble' mechanic.
    </p>

<br/>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
                Puzzles:
            </em>
</strong> 
        Using the mechanics of playing as a cassette tape, the core mechanics of the game and being supported by a killer soundtrack, you can navigate through puzzle to puzzle to complete the game.
    </p>
<p>
        ""Within the puzzles I really spent time thinking and planning how I can teach the player through trial and error on how to complete the puzzles themselves using the taught mechanics. Progressively teaching the player through play"".

<p>
<em>
<strong>
                The Tumble: 
            </strong>
</em>
        Whilst moving and jumping throughout Super Mixtape, you have the ability to control your 'tumble' to correct yourself. If you land upside-down, you can use the jumps momentum and tumble to correct yourself and continue on your path. When upside-down, Mix's facial expression will change until he is corrected.

<h3>
        Super Mixtape: Funding
    </h3>
<p>
        With Super Mixtape I need to raise funds to finish development of the product. Finance will also be used for fees, backups, marketing and promotional materials, web-server and maintenance.
        <br/>
<br/>
From the start I wanted to create an interesting game that falls within the ‘fun’ category, but I enjoy games that have a challenge to them, so have been working hard to find a 'happy-balance' with the physics and gameplay within Super Mixtape. 
        <br/>
<br/>
        I will be launching a public Trello in the coming weeks for Super Mixtape so that the public can see the developments progress.

            Super Mixtape is a retro physics based rhythm-puzzle-platformer where you guide cassette tape ‘Mix’ across fully reversible 2D world of A-Sides and B-Sides, completing puzzles as you progress to find the perfect beat.
        


        With a nostalgic late 80’s narrative and levels build to a beat that you control, define your own path using refined physics, unique mechanics and a fully interactive soundtrack that shapes the very landscape and its formidable puzzles around you.
    



            - “It throws everything you know about the standard platformer out of the window and creates its own rules.” – Otaku. 
            

            - “My favourite game of EGX 2015” – GameGazm. 
        





Super Mixtape Steam Greenlight went live on Christmas Eve 2015 and got the Greenlight on New Years Eve 2015 (8 days).



        Super Mixtape: Features
    


            World Flip – flip the world, like a cassette, playing forwards and backwards. The Flip Mechanic is the core mechanic of the game. 
        

            Tumble – Tumble allows the player to correct themselves and rotate in the air. Challenging the rules of traditional 2D gameplay by allowing player rotation. The main character’s facial expression will change depending on his position. 
        

            Jump and Physics – The jump in Super Mixtape is like no other jump and requires the player to jump from either the left or the right to gain height or distance based on the physics applied to the cassette. Supported by a considered and natural control scheme. 
        

            Beat Switches – Being able to ‘switch the beat’ remixes the audio in the game and areas of the level will react to the change. The ‘beats’ are colour coordinated with supported differentiating patterns to assist players who suffer with colour-blindness or colour vision deficiencies. 
        

            Puzzles – Navigate across puzzles in each level.
        

            Audio – The audio progresses with you as you progress through the levels.
        




        Super Mixtape: Feedback
    



Tag Cloud: A selection of feedback that Super Mixtape has received on the Steam Greenlight page.




        Super Mixtape: History
    

        Super Mixtape has been in development since February 2015 and has gone through multiple iterations before reaching this point. A 'Feature Rich' prototype level of the game was shown to the public at EuroGamer (EGX) September 2015 in Birmingham, UK, on a double wide booth, and was extremely well received.

<h3>How It All Started</h3>
<p>Yoooooooooo whaddup this is Nicholas Prindle aka BlueWind. I woke up from a dream on New Years Day of 2018 with a vision that I could make a solid 3D video game. I've focused on achieving this goal ever since, and with the amazing help &amp; talents from friends and family the idea has finally blossomed into something worth sharing.</p>

<h3>Plot Summary</h3>
<p>Thousands of years ago the planet Nova was a mystical place only inhabited by its magical caretakers, the Zen Guardians, and animal companions known as Novetians. Nova's two neighboring planets, Romulus and Eros, were densely populated by multiple species of sentient beings. Things had been good on Romulus and Eros for a time, but their societies began to crumble due to the strain from a harsh class system. </p>
<p>There was a great war initiated by the bureaucrats of each planet's societies that involved both planets attacking each other for land and resources they wanted on Nova. Since Romulus and Eros were within spitting distance of each other while Nova was relatively far away in comparison, they resorted to attacking and sabotaging each other before either could manage to land on Nova. And thus the Great War for Nova ensued...</p>
<p>However, in a victory for the working class, a massive migration event took place when the Zen Guardians intervened and rescued those not involved with the war using their magic powers by teleporting them back to Nova. After this miraculous event, the Zen Guardians were drained from using so much power to transport everyone. Seeing this, the only hyper-intelligent species from Romulus known as the Clow Clow enacted a huge technological feat that employed a barrier around all of Nova preventing any spacecraft from entering its atmosphere. All species joined in to build the machine and protect the planet.<br/><br/> After that, there was peace. <br/><br/>All the species that made it to Nova have lived in harmony and unison with the planet and the Zen Guardians for generations. They've been very appreciative of the world they live in and all the splendor, sustenance and comfort it naturally provides them. Each species has respectively gravitated to regions and adapted to those that suit them best, but some folks like to wonder and see Nova in all of its glory, too. Huge cities and technological feats have been achieved, as well as the dawn of artistic pursuits like music and painting. Things are thriving, and renewable energy sources are abundant and powering the way new Novans live. </p>
<p><br/><i>Fast forward to the present day. </i><br/><br/><strong>*Cue Conflict*</strong><br/><br/>But now something's amiss on the once peaceful planet Nova! The Zen Guardians are being slowly wiped out by an unknown force. You fill in the shoes of Aura, a young Lon Lon, who in a rare twist of fate, is given the ability to use magic. With this power in your hands you must choose how you will go about responding to the newfound chaos that is rocking your once calm planet. </p>

<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p><i><u>A Brief Summary</u></i></p>
<p>This game is a puzzlebox. It's meant to be replayed several times to see and find all the endings and branching paths. The game world and NPCs are visually effected by your actions and things can turn bad quick if you're not careful. There's also beaucoup Easter Eggs and other hidden content so have fun experimenting!<br/><br/><i><u>The Day System</u></i></p>
<p>You can only perform so many actions in each game day on Nova, and you have so many days to complete story missions you are sent on. After a certain amount of in-game days have passed, you'll encounter one of the many endings the game has to offer and see the weight of your actions. Seize the day! <br/><br/><u><i>Emotions</i></u></p>
<p>Every situation you encounter effects an emotional meter for your character . If you don't find time to meditate or make art, you may have an emotional spike during any stressful situation that happens in the game. You can lose the ability to make choices and watch in horror as your character reacts on their own. Don't lose your cool! </p>
<p><i><u>Classes</u></i></p>
<p>There are three player types or classes you can choose from. This helps you navigate obstacles differently with every playthrough. Overcome &amp; adapt! </p>
<p><i><u>Novetian Companions</u></i></p>
<p>Over 20 choices of Novetian companions are available, each with their own unique abilities that help you both in general gameplay and in conflict resolution. *pats*</p>
<p><i><u>Farming &amp; Cooking</u></i></p>
<p>Find fertile pieces of soil throughout the game world to farm with various types of plants and make batches of different recipes to feed yourself and your animal companion, or gift a meal to NPCs you've befriended. Yummy! <br/><br/><i><u>Battling</u></i><br/>Using all the aforementioned systems and being inspired by JRPGs, battling just involves having better numbers than the bad guys. Or so you thought?  ;D </p>
<p><i><u>Music</u></i></p>
<p>Over 200 songs totaling at 7 hours of music has already been written for the game. While the official soundtrack is only gonna be 4-5 hours, there is also hidden music throughout the game world in the form of collectable vinyl records. You can play the records you find in the game world at the end of each day at your house. <br/><br/><i><u>Games That Inspired Us</u></i><br/>The gameplay itself was influenced by many different games like Persona, Harvest Moon, Pokemon, and Majora's Mask with some fresh new takes on the RPG genre as a whole. </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Aeternum Vale is an atmospheric pixel-art adventure game for PC & Mac. It was originally funded through Kickstarter on September 14th 2020. Check out the Kickstarter page that started it all !  Interested in game development? Pixel art? Level design? Want to know more about the project, see more of the game? Join me on Twitch for some relaxed game dev streams and let's have a chat! twitch.tv/boriscerdan  Why Indiegogo InDemand ?The idea originated from late backers who found out about the Kickstarter campaign after the deadline, and wanted to still be able to get the game at a discounted price, be part of the community and help the project reach higher stretch goals.Indeed, while the game surpassed its initial goal of 4500€, only the 5000€ stretch goal unlocking an additional secret boss was reached.This InDemand post-campaign is the occasion for the game to keep working towards the Nintendo Switch port stretch goal of 6500€, which is really dear to a lot of the backers, and me. Additional funds would also allow a proper release campaign, and ensure that development can still continue, even in case of eventual delays. Moreover, this post-campaign page is a new opportunity for me to keep spreading the word about the game until it releases, communicate on development's progress and share with all of you awsome updates related to the project! :)     


 
What is Aeternum Vale ?


Aeternum Vale is a melodic & atmospheric 2D pixel-art adventure through a strange and uncharted world, full of riddles and mysteries, set somewhere between a puzzle platformer and a Metroidvania.
 
You will have to roam this huge handcrafted world, uncovering secret paths and new abilities enabling you to keep exploring further and further these strange unexplored lands, while facing a wide array of enemies and deadly bosses. But the soul of the project resides in its evocative storytelling, told through the world itself and an endearing cast of wacky characters.
 
Through this unwordly mist,
YOU are the main character.
This is YOUR story.
YOU are lost. 
 

But everybody gets lost. 
And it's time to find the way back. 
 
Inspirations
Gameplay-wise, the game finds its roots in retro titles like Castlevania or Metroid, and in more modern takes on the Metroidvania genre in games like Hollow Knight. But aside from the pad-in-hands feel, the overall experience also draws from funny old school point'n'click adventure games like Monkey Island and takes inspiration in indie titles with a different way of storytelling, like Undertale and its crazy characters or Gris and its vivid world and organic manner of delivering an emotionally driven story. All of The Legend of Zelda series was also a huge influence on me, being a life long fan.  
 
The Project
Aeternum Vale is almost entirely a solo project.
Apart from the soundtrack, composed by the very talented Wesley Coleman, and the punctual participation of some graphic designers (most of them being backers of the project and part of our discord community), the game is written, developed, and designed solely by myself.  
 
Telling stories through interactive media with complete creative freedom turned out to be an extremely rewarding experience. Being the programmer, loremaster, and designer of a whole living, breathing world allows me to tell a very personal and, I hope, engaging story, populated by unique characters and full of memorable places players will want to return to.
 

But this freedom comes at a great cost in time.
The game turned out to be a colossal enterprise to be taken alone, and even though I'm able to make considerable progress daily, it's at the expense of almost the entirety of my days, evenings, and often weekends.
 

It's time that I'm more than willing to sacrifice on a project that I'm so passionate about from its very start, and which motivates me as nothing did before in my life. Even if I still find it very hard to compose with the different other aspects of the project (marketing, financing, community management, etc), I do my best to keep the community updated on the game's progress, and put a lot of value in total transparency regarding the whole project.
Being the lone father of this beautiful child of pixels makes me the only person accountable, and I intend to rigorously follow my rules of ethics throughout the all process, from development to release, for the sake of the people involved, the players, and my own. :)

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Darryl
Isaac, but in my online content, I will assume the Pen/Stage Name “Ohgun”. When
I was just in High School, I began to experiment with various programs
to help make my dream of becoming video game designer a reality. Such programs
include:</p>
<p>DAZ Studio<br/>
GameMaker<br/>
M.U.G.E.N.<br/>
Blender<br/>
Poser<br/>
MakeHuman<br/>
VisualBasic<br/>
BlueJ<br/>
Python<br/>
Photoshop</p>
<p>I've had experiences with 3D
graphics and game engines back in High School, but now I want to use my
experiences to start off my very own animation studio and entertain my
potential audience with CGI films, gaming streams and vlogs. Another reason
why I'm running this campaign is because in March 19th, my mother had suffered
a heart attack and had to be taken to St. Francis Hospital in Bartlet. The next
day, she had to undergo bypass surgery within St. Francis Hospital in Park
Avenue. She had a very successful operation and has undergone a full recovery.
It was that experience that taught me a very vital life lesson: I can't live
off of someone else forever and I would have to start fending for myself. Hence
this is why I am intending to start up my very own business for the first time.
But prior to my mother’s medical issues, I was beginning to question whether or
not I can actually make my dream a reality. I was scared that if I give up on
my journey now, I could end up having to work several dead end and stressful
jobs for the rest of my life. So even though it was rather stubborn, I decided
to keep on pursuing my dream and even changing course towards a field in
Graphic Design that focuses on making CGI graphics and art. I even considered
starting my own CGI animation studio last year. Since the day I came up with
O-152 Studios, decided to put my own survival on the line to turn my idea into
an effective startup that will continue to grow even after I pass away.</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>What is this campaign and why is this campaign
important to you?</i></b><br/>This campaign is mainly to raise funds to not only officially open up
my online 3D animation/live action film company O-152 Studios, but to offer financial
support to St. Francis Hospital in Memphis, TN for the care they gave my mother
and so many other patients for 40 years. The main reason for raising funds is
because I do not have the resources I need to create the entirety of the
content I desire to produce and release on my own platform. The importance of
this campaign to me is to change the lives of people all other the world
including my own for the greater good and promote enjoyment and satisfaction from my audience in the process.</p><p><i>
</i></p><p><b><i>What magnitude am I going to help
you achieve with this campaign?</i></b><br/><span>When I first make 3D Animation Videos online, I’ll
mainly target the gamers and 3D Animation fans within the Memphis area. After
gathering that audience, I will eventually cater towards people from around the
world all while providing a mixture of entertainment and addressing social issues
within American communities. All while bring forth said issues with the
intention of having conversations amongst the audience and any opposition
towards my beliefs and opinions.</span></p><i><i>

Indiegogo (9% if Stage 1 is incomplete, or 4% if Stage 1 is completed) and
PayPal (2.7%). Any funding after the fees that falls short of a certain stage’s
goal will be donated St. Francis Hospital’s Park Ave. branch. And any excess
funds will be focused on preparing Phase 2 and 3 perks for distribution. The
Products purchased using the funds will be the items listed in my acquisition
books and all outstanding expenses will on my personal expense. Here is the chart that will show exactly how the funds will be spent:</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435804980/ug6guh3kicenj0ne4qyp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><i><i><i>
</i></i></i><p><b><i>What are some perks that are
offered with this campaign?</i></b><br/>
</p><p>The perks for this campaign vary
between a simple “Thank You” message sent directly to you by me personally, or
your name being listed as one of my Executive Producers in my videos bundled
with all the perks in that particular Phase. However, more perks will be
unlocked based on which Phase the fundraiser is currently on. Some perks
however, are extremely limited, so claim them while they last.</p>
<p><span>For starters, the Perks available
for launch include:<br/>
Thank You Messages<br/>
Free VIP Memberships<br/>
Render Requests (Only 20 Available individually)<br/>
Little Shortie Request (Only 10 Available individually)<br/>
Shortie Request (Only 10 Available individually)<br/>
Quartie Request (Only 5 Available individually)<br/>
Associate Producer’s Combo (Only 10 Available, Can select any two Perks
currently unlocked)<br/>
Phase 1 Completionist (Only 4 Available, includes Thank You Message, Lifetime
VIP Membership, and Render, Little Shortie, Shortie, and Quartie Requests)</span></p>
<i><i><i></i></i></i><p><b><i>How will this campaign impact us?</i></b><br/>
</p><p>With this campaign, I intend to
change the lives of my audiences and my own with the Vlogs, and PSAs I intend
to make for my website. I also intend to entertain my audience with my videos,
films, game streams, and eventually video games. But overall, I want this
campaign to impact the audience by opening their eyes to what’s really
happening in America using representations of events that are occurring within
not only my current hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, but around the United
States and eventually the world.</p><i><i><i><i>
</i></i></i></i><p><b><i>What are some of the risks and
challenges for the O-152 Studios Campaign?</i></b><br/>The main challenge I have to take in order to do this campaign is to
ensure that I can actually accomplish this task is my inexperience with the software
I intend to use in order to produce videos and movies. To overcome that
challenge, I will use my determination to work and desire to learn the ropes of the software's structure and systems to develop exemplary quality content.</p>
<p>Now the major risk of this
campaign is there will be critics that will pop up from out of the woodworks
and instantly assume that this campaign is a fraud.<br/></p><p><i><i><i><i><i></i></i></i></i></i></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It’s understandable that I may
have some people come out and make such an accusation, but in response to this, I have thoroughly documented what I intend to do with the money you’ve
contributed to my campaign via the Acquisition Books I have made. All three books will be solid proof that their contributions are going towards the
right places and spent wisely.<br/></p>
<i><i><i><i><i>
</i></i></i></i></i><p><b><i>I can’t afford to make a
contribution to the campaign!</i></b><br/>
</p><p>Can’t afford to make a
contribution? Well don’t worry about it. Simply sharing the campaign’s page
with your family and friends in real life and on social media sites such as facebook and Twitter
using the hashtag #O152Campaign, Tumblr, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest and
StumbleUpon can spread the word about this campaign and helping the campaign
reach its overall goal even faster. Even take a picture of yourself with my
campaign and post it on Instagram with the hashtag #O152Campaign, or simply
send them an email containing the link to my campaign so they can be able to
contribute to my cause. While you’re at it, go ahead and spread the word to the
streets about my campaign, even print out one of my flyers for the campaign and
post them all over your office, your establishment, your house, or even the
neighborhood telephone poles (with the owner's/supervisor's/neighborhood’s
consent of course). You can even give some to your family and friends so that
they can help spread the word about this campaign.</p>

PayPal (2.7%). Any funding after the fees that falls short of a certain stage’s
goal will be donated St. Francis Hospital’s Park Ave. branch. And any excess
funds will be focused on preparing Phase 2 and 3 perks for distribution. The
Products purchased using the funds will be the items listed in my acquisition
books and all outstanding expenses will on my personal expense. Here is the chart that will show exactly how the funds will be spent:
What are some perks that are
offered with this campaign?
The perks for this campaign vary
between a simple “Thank You” message sent directly to you by me personally, or
your name being listed as one of my Executive Producers in my videos bundled
with all the perks in that particular Phase. However, more perks will be
unlocked based on which Phase the fundraiser is currently on. Some perks
however, are extremely limited, so claim them while they last.
For starters, the Perks available
for launch include:
Thank You Messages
Free VIP Memberships
Render Requests (Only 20 Available individually)
Little Shortie Request (Only 10 Available individually)
Shortie Request (Only 10 Available individually)
Quartie Request (Only 5 Available individually)
Associate Producer’s Combo (Only 10 Available, Can select any two Perks
currently unlocked)
Phase 1 Completionist (Only 4 Available, includes Thank You Message, Lifetime
VIP Membership, and Render, Little Shortie, Shortie, and Quartie Requests)
How will this campaign impact us?
With this campaign, I intend to
change the lives of my audiences and my own with the Vlogs, and PSAs I intend
to make for my website. I also intend to entertain my audience with my videos,
films, game streams, and eventually video games. But overall, I want this
campaign to impact the audience by opening their eyes to what’s really
happening in America using representations of events that are occurring within
not only my current hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, but around the United
States and eventually the world.
What are some of the risks and
challenges for the O-152 Studios Campaign?The main challenge I have to take in order to do this campaign is to
ensure that I can actually accomplish this task is my inexperience with the software
I intend to use in order to produce videos and movies. To overcome that
challenge, I will use my determination to work and desire to learn the ropes of the software's structure and systems to develop exemplary quality content.
Now the major risk of this
campaign is there will be critics that will pop up from out of the woodworks
and instantly assume that this campaign is a fraud.

It’s understandable that I may
have some people come out and make such an accusation, but in response to this, I have thoroughly documented what I intend to do with the money you’ve
contributed to my campaign via the Acquisition Books I have made. All three books will be solid proof that their contributions are going towards the
right places and spent wisely.

I can’t afford to make a
contribution to the campaign!
Can’t afford to make a
contribution? Well don’t worry about it. Simply sharing the campaign’s page
with your family and friends in real life and on social media sites such as facebook and Twitter
using the hashtag #O152Campaign, Tumblr, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest and
StumbleUpon can spread the word about this campaign and helping the campaign
reach its overall goal even faster. Even take a picture of yourself with my
campaign and post it on Instagram with the hashtag #O152Campaign, or simply
send them an email containing the link to my campaign so they can be able to
contribute to my cause. While you’re at it, go ahead and spread the word to the
streets about my campaign, even print out one of my flyers for the campaign and
post them all over your office, your establishment, your house, or even the
neighborhood telephone poles (with the owner's/supervisor's/neighborhood’s
consent of course). You can even give some to your family and friends so that
they can help spread the word about this campaign.

Viola! Like two interlockable Lego Bricks, Dstream is born!

Well if you're not fond of Lego's it doesn't matter. This is about videogames. Many streams I see have little lasting value. There's the community, that's good. Yet even a design stream I watched recently seemed a bit...boring. With Dstream things get more exciting:

Series Breakdown  I take one franchise, say the Legend Of Zelda or Need for Speed, and play a variety of their games.

One QuestionFor each franchise, a series of episodes debuts with one specific question we aim to answer about the games as a whole (e.g. why so successful?)


Trivia and ""You Had No Ideas""
About real games you enjoy! Things you never knew (or maybe you did)!


Do's and Don't
And I'll track what's good and bad in the games...see what you can apply to your projects. Practical stuff here.

Drawing on elements from Greek mythology, Plato’s Republic, and Metropolis, you, a player in this society, will plunge directly into the middle of conflict and unrest.</p><p>Every decision you make causes a reaction that affects not only your own story line, but the story of the players around you. You are creating a story web that is constantly in flux and shifting. Non Player Character (NPC) actors will help guide you through your experience, but you may not be aware of who is a player and who is an actor. You will be deceived. You will be manipulated. You will be watched. The more you challenge and engage in the world around you, the stronger your journey will be.</p><h2>Experience</h2>There are three different factions inside the world we are creating: The Republic, The Office, The Labyrinth. Each faction has a unique design and will feel completely different than the others. Guests will be immediately thrown into one of these areas. Depending on which faction you are placed into, you will interact more heavily with those characters and that story line. However, each story line interweaves with the others, so you will experience each environment. I'm going to remain vague about the design and story specifics as I don't want to spoil the exploratory nature of the project and the sense of discovery the players should feel. We will slowly release a few story and design teasers, but you must come and explore/experience for yourself. Just know, the sets are going to be elaborate, overwhelming at times, and there are going to be moving elements, special effects, and elements that warp your sense of reality. The space design alone will immediately draw you into this new world. The other players and actors will then heighten the space and guide you into your own story where you have to make decisions that will change your game and the games of those around you. You may be kidnapped, you will be touched, you will feel uncomfortable, you will be watched, so this is not for the faint of heart. However, this is not a horror genre, this experience is not meant to frighten you, although you may experience elements of fear. We are pushing you out of your comfort zone through interactions with the actors and spaces. If at any moment you feel too uncomfortable or challenged, we do have a safe word in place: Pineapple.<p> </p><div>

I never wanted to be any of these singularly, but instead want to mush them all together into something messy, some new medium. Going to graduate school and studying architecture really heightened this desire to combine my passions. The more I was designing architectural spaces, the more I wanted to also express my love for dance and sculpture. This sense of entrapment inside architecture led me to flee to the theater department where the first of these interactive/architectural/theatrical productions emerged. I felt alive in the first production, The Labyrinth Experiment. I found an amazing group of students to play and brainstorm these ideas with me. We were blindly trying to find a way to create an experience that pushed people to think and took the audience out of their seats and into the action of a production. I want the audience to feel like they are the stars in their own play and get to make decisions that affect their play. This is where gaming elements emerged. I realized all the hours I spent playing World of Warcraft were paying off. Bring in gaming was natural. People now had a reason to participate in the experience and drive the story. The Republic is about the audience, the players, and empowering them to push themselves in a risk free environment that is out of the computer and in reality.<br/>

</div></div>","(Para la informacion en Español, ve al final de la página)We are ARCHANICA, a new RPG initiative, and we want to publish
the MECANOTECHNICS HANDBOOK, a product that we've been working on for nearly
12 years. 


This is a sourcebook for D&D 3.5 and Pathfinder; it introduces Mecanotechnics,
a new power source based on science and technology. Just like the Psionics
Handbook, this book contains new races, character classes, skills, feats,
accessories, and features to expand your campaign world.

However, we need your support to publish it. We started
designing this book as teenagers and didn't have the means to publish it
professionally, but we worked a lot on it during all these years, with the goal
of releasing it someday. 

And now the day has come.
Fortunately, the book is already written! But as we hail from
Mexico, we wrote everything in Spanish, and translating so much content is not
a piece of cake. So, the main goal of this funding campaign is to collect the
money to translate it to English so the whole world can enjoy it, as well as to
cover more resources to pay for professional design and artwork.




The book contains all this:


 
· 
A complete
system of CREATION AND USAGE OF MECANOTECH weapons and accessories.
· 
5 brand new PLAYABLE RACES (plus 4 ADVANCED RACES) that define the
flavor of a scientific campaign setting.
· 
4 never seen
before CHARACTER CLASSES (and 6 SUB-CLASSES)
based on the mecanotechnics power source, plus 3 OBSCURANTIST CLASSES
specially designed to fit in medieval and proto-scientific settings.
· 
Around 150 MACHINES, SUBSTANCES,
and scientific weapons, with more than 500
optional UPGRADES available to
improve them and expand their functions.
· 
More than 70 TECHNOLOGIES with different uses,
and more than 600 UPGRADES to customize them.
· 
About 30 NEW FEATS to improve the scientific
prowess of mecanotech character classes and 40 GENERAL FEATS to grant non-scientific character classes
expertise in the usage of machines and technologies.
· 
More than 50 detailed ACCESSORIES, including consumables, machine components, improved
materials, gadgets and various items useful in mecanotech adventures.
· 
A full-fledged ALTERNATE SYSTEM OF MECANOTECHNICS,
featuring almost 60 IMPLEMENTS and ADD-ONS, for a different approach to
the power of science.
· 
SPECIAL ADVANCE OPTIONS for scientific characters to study more than one science area and
balancing different disciplines.
· 
An entire
chapter dedicated to DESIGNING THE ROLE
OF SCIENCE IN YOUR WORLD, featuring rule sets, examples and suggestions on
how to build a world of mecanotechnics based on your preferences as a game
director.


Our project is modest: We aim for a digital release with only a few
illustrations so you may have a taste of the world of mecanotechnics. But if
you want more, you can get more. The resources would be expended as following:


Translation to English. The book's around 500 pages long, between
     rules and descriptions of our world. As English is the standard language
     out there, we think it's the best way to reach people from any country.

Digital Design. We
     want to present a dignified book, so we want to pay a designer. The book
     includes important design elements like charts, stat blocks and special
     log sheets that players can use to keep track of their technologies.


Artwork. We
wish to include at least illustrations for the new races and classes, and
     we have a badass artist, Luis Ruíz. But if we exceed our primary
     goal, we'd love to give you more of our world: Machine designs,
     technologies, civilizations... everything you can imagine!

Website. We
     want to stay in touch with our readers so a forum is the perfect way to
     receive feedback from you and give you updates about the book, both pre-
     and post-launch.

Administrative Costs. Registering a trademark, getting the
     copyrights and creating contracts for international artists to work with
     us can be expensive. We're also spending money on promotional material and
     exposure in media.
Whether we reach our goal or not, we'll do our best to bring you the book,
but without your help, the wait could be way longer...



 
If you want to take a look at what we offer, you can download a sample pack with some of the rules of the handbook.

The sample pack contains:

4 new playable character races: Atlantean, Kyri, Erron and Fril.

5 playable character classes: Mechanic, Chemist, Mech Knight, Gunslinger and Musketeer.
New skills and feats.
Complete lists of machines and technologies for all classes.

27 machine samples (Level 1-2) with their upgrades.

4 technology samples (Level 1) with their upgrades.

Guide of accessories and consumables.

•  4 CLASES
DE PERSONAJE nunca antes vistas (y 6
SUBCLASES) basadas en la fuente de poder mecanotécnica, además de 3 CLASES OSCURANTISTAS especialmente
diseñadas para funcionar en entornos medievales y proto-científicos.
•  Cerca
de 150 MÁQUINAS, SUSTANCIAS y armas
científicas, con más de 500 MEJORAS opcionales para aumentarlas y expandir
sus funciones.
•  Más
de 70 TECNOLOGÍAS con distintos
usos, y más de 600 MEJORAS para
personalizarlas.
•  Alrededor
de 50 NUEVAS DOTES para mejorar las
aptitudes científicas de clases mecanotécnicas, y 30 DOTES GENERALES para aumentar la pericia de clases no
científicas en el uso de máquinas y tecnologías.
•  Más
de 50 ACCESORIOS detallados,
incluyendo consumibles, componentes de máquinas, materiales mejorados,
artilugios y objetos diversos útiles en aventuras mecanotécnicas.
•  Un
SISTEMA ALTERNO DE MECANOTECNIA
totalmente desarrollado, con casi 60
IMPLEMENTOS y ADITAMENTOS, para
un acercamiento diferente a la práctica de la ciencia.
•  OPCIONES DE AVANCE especiales para
personajes científicos que estudien más de un área de la ciencia y deseen
balancear diferentes disciplinas.
•  Un
capítulo completo dedicado a DISEÑAR EL
PAPEL DE LA CIENCIA EN TU MUNDO, incluyendo conjuntos de reglas, ejemplos y
sugerencias de cómo construir un mundo de la mecanotecnia a tu gusto como
director de juego.

Nuestro proyecto es modesto: Buscamos 
publicar el libro digitalmente y con sólo unas cuantas ilustraciones 
para que puedas tener una probada del mundo de la mecanotecnia. Pero si 
quieres más, podemos hacerlo. Los recursos se destinarán a lo siguiente:


Traducción al inglés. El libro es de casi 500 páginas, entre 
reglas y descripciones de nuestro mundo. Ya que el inglés es el lenguaje
 estándar de los RPG, creemos que es la mejor meta de llevar nuestro 
libro a cualquier audiencia. 

Diseño digital. Queremos presentar el libro de forma digna, así que necesitamos 
pagar a un diseñador. El libro incluye elementos de diseño importantes 
como tablas, fichas de estadísticas y bitácoras especiales que los 
jugadores pueden usar para llevar un registro de sus máquinas y 
tecnologías.


Ilustraciones. Queremos incluir al menos ilustraciones para las nuevas razas y clases, y tenemos un genial artista, Luis Ruíz. Pero si rebasamos nuestra meta principal, nos encantaría mostrarte más de nuestro mundo: Diseños de máquinas, tecnologías, civilizaciones... ¡Todo lo que puedas imaginar!

Sitio web. Queremos estar en contacto con nuestros lectores así que un foro es la forma perfecta de recibir retroalimentación de tu parte y darte actualizaciones del libro, tanto antes como después del lanzamiento.

Costos administrativos. Registrar una marca registrada, obtener derechos de autor y crear contratos para trabajar con artistas internacionales tiene un precio. También invertiremos en material promocional y publicidad.
Alcancemos o no nuestras metas, haremos todo lo posible para traerte el libro, pero sin tu ayuda, la espera puede ser mucho más larga...





Si quieres echar un vistazo a lo que ofrecemos, puedes descargar el paquete de muestra oficial con algunas reglas del manual:

El paquete de muestra contiene:

4 nuevas razas de personaje: Atlante, Cairi, Erro y Fril.

5 clases de personaje: Mecánico, Químico, Caballero Iniciado, Pistolero y Mosquetero.
Nuevas habilidades y dotes.
Listas completas de máquinas y tecnologías para todas las clases.

27 máquinas de muestra (Niveles 1-2) con sus mejoras.

4 technologías de muestra (Nivel 1) con sus mejoras.
Guía de accesorios y consumibles.

Como puedes ver, nuestro proyecto es ambicioso y queremos ofrecer la experiencia más completa posible. Por desgracia, entre más contenido, los costos de traducción y diseño digital se elevan, y de momento no podemos confirmar cuánto apoyo obtendríamos de nuestro público potencial.Es por eso que decidimos crear una versión depurada que reduce el libro a lo que consideramos lo ""esencial"" pero sin compometer el balance del sistema de ninguna forma.Esta ""Edición Esencial"" contendría menos razas, clases de personaje (así como menos contenido derivado de éstas) y unas pocas menos de tecnologías. Y por tanto, costaría menos. Pero todo lo que mantiene el juego balanceado y disfrutable quedaría completamente intacto. Lo único que quedaría fuera serían unas pocasopciones para el jugador.Por tanto, manejaremos la ""ESSENTIAL EDITION"" como nuestra meta principal para asegurar la publicación del libro, mientras que una ""EXPANDED EDITION"" con el contenido completo sería nuestra primera meta adicional, si nuestro público demanda la experiencia más completa posible.Puedes ver las diferencias entre la Edición Esencial y la Expandida aquí:Queremos dejar claro que la Edición Expandida no es una recompensa sino una meta adicional. Eso quiere decir que todos los que hagan la mínima contribución al proyecto recibirían la Edición Expandida si la meta adicional es alcanzada. Pero está en tus manos ayudarnos a que se logre.




Nuestro sueño con este libro es crear un nuevo libro de cabecera para productos de fantasía basados en el sistema d20, y creemos tener lo que se necesita.

Aunque este es nuestro primer proyecto, creemos que nuestro sistema es lógico, flexible y una forma emocionante de manejar a héroes científicos en juegos RPG, para cambiar el mundo de los juegos de fantasía y ser un recurso útil para cualquier nuevo jugador.




Los principales riesgos para este proyecto son posibles eventualidades en el sistema de juego, pero hemos puesto mucha atención al detalle y quieremos seguir así en caso de que algo cause problemas.
Sostendremos un periodo de prueba extendido antes de lanzar el libro, y así los jugadores podrán decirnos qué ajustes podemos hacer en la versión final. De igual forma, queremos seguir trabajando en el libro después de la publicación usando los foros como medio de contacto y retroalimentación.

De ese modo podremos proveer a los lectores con revisiones de cualquier fallo, y si se vuelve necesario, una edición corregida del libro de forma gratuita para nuestros donantes.




Al ser nuestra lengua nativa, la versión en español del libro ya está escrita, sin embargo para lanzar el proyecto queremos enfocarnos primero en nuestra audiencia internacional.

El diseño digital de versiones en ambos idiomas duplicaría los costos y comprometería el éxito del proyecto, por lo que dejamos la perspectiva de una edición en español para un futuro. 
Aun así, si eres de nuestra audiencia hispana agradeceremos mucho tu apoyo, ya que nos ayudará a hacer realidad una edición en español en un futuro próximo. Además, si apoyas el proyecto, compartiremos contigo todo el contenido del libro en español (aunque solamente en texto, sin diseño digital) cuando llegue la fecha de entrega de este proyecto.
Aún si no estás familiarizado con los juegos de rol, puedes ayudarnos a cumplir nuestro sueño. ¿Conoces a alguien que podría estar interesado? Por favor, diles sobre nuestro proyecto, ¡Estaremos agradecidos!(For English information, go the top of the page)",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

And with so many of today's games focusing on competition and high scores, Eat Poop You Cat instead focuses on fun, creativity, and collaboration.</p><p><br/></p><h1>The Game</h1><p>Eat Poop You Cat originated as a party game played with pencil and paper. We want to make it into a mobile game, so you can play wherever you want, whenever you want, with whomever you want!</p><p>Here's how it'll work:</p><ul>
<li>You sign into the app with your Facebook account, and then pick a handful of Facebook friends that you want to play with.</li>
<li>When the game begins, everyone starts by writing a sentence or phrase for the next player to try to draw. This phrase can be anything you think up! </li>

<h1>The History</h1>
<p>The history of Eat Poop You Cat is shrouded myths and legends, but Eat Poop You Cat, LLC's resident amateur historian (myself), believes that it probably has its roots in the surrealist parlour games of the early 20th century, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequences_(game)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Consequences </a>and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Exquisite Corpse</a>. And like ""Exquisite Corpse"", the name ""Eat Poop You Cat"" probably arose from the game itself. Exquisite Corpse got its name from the first time the game was played, in Paris, c. 1925, wherefrom arose the phrase, ""Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau."" (""The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine."") <a href=""https://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/content/simone-collinet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Simone Collinet</a> described the scene in 1968:</p>
<p><i>It was during one of those idle and tedious evenings, frequent at that time - contrary to subsequent descriptions which benefit from hindsight - that the Exquisite Corpse was invented.</i></p>
<p><i>Someone said: 'How about playing Consequences? That's entertaining.' So we played the traditional game of Consequences. Monsieur meets Madame, he says to her, and so on. But not for long. The game rapidly became something else. 'Just write down anything at all', <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Pr%C3%A9vert"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Prévert</a> suggested.</i></p>
<p><i>In the next round, the Exquisite Corpse was born. From Prévert's pen, as a matter of fact, for he wrote the first words, so perfectly complemented by those following; one wrote: 'shall drink the new'; the next: 'wine'.</i></p>
<p><i>Once their imagination was let loose, it couldn't be stopped. </i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Breton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">André </a><i>exclaimed with delight and immediately saw in it one of those wellsprings or natural outpourings of inspiration he so loved to discover. A torrent was unleashed.</i></p>
<p><i>Even more reliably than with automatic writing, one was sure of jarring amalgams. Violent surprises prompted admiration, laughter, and stirred an unquenchable craving for new images - images inconceivable to one brain alone - born from the involuntary, unconscious and unpredictable mixing of three or four heterogeneous minds. Some sentences took on an aggressively subversive existence. Others veered into an excessive absurdity. The wastepaper basket played its part. One tends to forget that.</i></p>
<p><i>The fact remains that the suggestive power of these arbitrary juxtapositions of words was so startling and dazzling and validated Surrealist theories and inclinations in such a striking way that the game became a system, a method of research, a means of exaltation and stimulus, a mine, a treasure-trove and finally, perhaps, a drug.</i></p>
<p>[From <i>Surrealist Games</i>, Alastair Brotchie, 1995]</p>
<p>The exquisite corpses of Simone Collinet, André Breton, and Jacques Prévert have declined our request for comments, but we believe they would favor what we undertake here: to bring that craving for inconceivable images and subversive juxtapositions of words to new, even more heterogeneous minds.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>The Money</h1>
<p>Perhaps the most important questions in crowdfunding are, ""why are you asking for our money?"" and, ""what will you do with it?"" Here're my answers. I'm asking for your money because, while I happen to be an experienced programmer, I'm not qualified to make a robust, polished mobile app.</p>
<p>I initially attempted to create this game all on my own. I spent a few weeks coding a prototype backend in Scala and ran it on Heroku. But then I got stuck. I'm a pretty competent backend engineer, but user interfaces and graphic design are complete mysteries to me, as the months I spent banging my head on the wall trying to create a serviceable android frontend can attest.</p>
<p>Now, with more time and effort, I might have been able to eek out something functional. But in the marketplace for mobile games, functional just doesn't cut it. If I want anyone to actually give this game a second glance, it has to work <i>great</i>, and look <i>spiffy. </i>And the best way for me to make that happen, is to pay some real professionals with proven track records.</p>
<p>That's where <a href=""https://zapporoo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zapporoo </a>comes in. I contacted a few freelancers and several companies who were in the business of building mobile apps, and Zappooroo is the company I settled on. Their services include programming the full application stack, for iOS and Android, and covering the costs and responsibilities of hosting the app's backend for the first full year.</p>
<p>Having never built something quite like this before, I felt it was important to get this high level of professional help. If I overestimate my abilities, if I bite off more than I can chew, and the app turns into an unreliable mess, it will never take off. I've seen too many apps fail that way.</p>
<p>So I talked with the people at Zaporoo about my idea, and they loved it! I spent a few thousand dollars of my own money on the initial design phase, and everything they've shown me looks great, and has convinced me that they understand the game itself, and how best to bring it to market.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Eat Poop You Cat - Blueprint Diagram"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/396/642/b15ad2e3cbe02992d8d26dfd7b48f537_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1456029915&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=08e286553a72f3e68e1e97b49c31a7b1"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Eat Poop You Cat - Blueprint Diagram</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>Now it's time to move forward with actually building the app, but the $20,000 price tag is out of reach for me to fund personally.  So that's why I'm turning to the crowdfunding community for help!</p>
<p>I've been a fan of crowdfunding for years, and I've personally pledged more than $8,500 to hundreds of different projects. I've seen the power crowdfunding has to build communities, to help creators connect to their patrons, to and bring fabulous new ideas to life. I can't tell you how excited I am to see that magic happen with a project of my very own!</p>

And with so many of today's games focusing on competition and high scores, Eat Poop You Cat instead focuses on fun, creativity, and collaboration.The GameEat Poop You Cat originated as a party game played with pencil and paper. We want to make it into a mobile game, so you can play wherever you want, whenever you want, with whomever you want!Here's how it'll work:
You sign into the app with your Facebook account, and then pick a handful of Facebook friends that you want to play with.
When the game begins, everyone starts by writing a sentence or phrase for the next player to try to draw. This phrase can be anything you think up! 


Once you've done that, the text you wrote will be sent to another player in the game, and someone else's text will be sent to you! When this happens, it'll be your turn to draw something that describes what they wrote!


When you send your drawing off, it's then the next player's turn to write something that describes your drawing, but without knowing what the text was that inspired it!


Then the next player has to make a drawing based on that text, and so on and so on. Write, draw, write, draw, etc. At each stage, the initial sentence gets more and more confused, and the drawings get more and more ridiculous!


Once your initial phrase has gone through 10 iterations of this, the game ends, and everyone gets to see the entire sequence of phrases and pictures from start to finish! At that point, you can share your favorite drawings on social media!
And that's the whole game! There are no winners or losers, just surreal drawings and funny phrases!

The History
The history of Eat Poop You Cat is shrouded myths and legends, but Eat Poop You Cat, LLC's resident amateur historian (myself), believes that it probably has its roots in the surrealist parlour games of the early 20th century, such as Consequences and Exquisite Corpse. And like ""Exquisite Corpse"", the name ""Eat Poop You Cat"" probably arose from the game itself. Exquisite Corpse got its name from the first time the game was played, in Paris, c. 1925, wherefrom arose the phrase, ""Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau."" (""The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine."") Simone Collinet described the scene in 1968:
It was during one of those idle and tedious evenings, frequent at that time - contrary to subsequent descriptions which benefit from hindsight - that the Exquisite Corpse was invented.
Someone said: 'How about playing Consequences? That's entertaining.' So we played the traditional game of Consequences. Monsieur meets Madame, he says to her, and so on. But not for long. The game rapidly became something else. 'Just write down anything at all', Prévert suggested.
In the next round, the Exquisite Corpse was born. From Prévert's pen, as a matter of fact, for he wrote the first words, so perfectly complemented by those following; one wrote: 'shall drink the new'; the next: 'wine'.
Once their imagination was let loose, it couldn't be stopped. André exclaimed with delight and immediately saw in it one of those wellsprings or natural outpourings of inspiration he so loved to discover. A torrent was unleashed.
Even more reliably than with automatic writing, one was sure of jarring amalgams. Violent surprises prompted admiration, laughter, and stirred an unquenchable craving for new images - images inconceivable to one brain alone - born from the involuntary, unconscious and unpredictable mixing of three or four heterogeneous minds. Some sentences took on an aggressively subversive existence. Others veered into an excessive absurdity. The wastepaper basket played its part. One tends to forget that.
The fact remains that the suggestive power of these arbitrary juxtapositions of words was so startling and dazzling and validated Surrealist theories and inclinations in such a striking way that the game became a system, a method of research, a means of exaltation and stimulus, a mine, a treasure-trove and finally, perhaps, a drug.
[From Surrealist Games, Alastair Brotchie, 1995]
The exquisite corpses of Simone Collinet, André Breton, and Jacques Prévert have declined our request for comments, but we believe they would favor what we undertake here: to bring that craving for inconceivable images and subversive juxtapositions of words to new, even more heterogeneous minds.

The Money
Perhaps the most important questions in crowdfunding are, ""why are you asking for our money?"" and, ""what will you do with it?"" Here're my answers. I'm asking for your money because, while I happen to be an experienced programmer, I'm not qualified to make a robust, polished mobile app.
I initially attempted to create this game all on my own. I spent a few weeks coding a prototype backend in Scala and ran it on Heroku. But then I got stuck. I'm a pretty competent backend engineer, but user interfaces and graphic design are complete mysteries to me, as the months I spent banging my head on the wall trying to create a serviceable android frontend can attest.
Now, with more time and effort, I might have been able to eek out something functional. But in the marketplace for mobile games, functional just doesn't cut it. If I want anyone to actually give this game a second glance, it has to work great, and look spiffy. And the best way for me to make that happen, is to pay some real professionals with proven track records.
That's where Zapporoo comes in. I contacted a few freelancers and several companies who were in the business of building mobile apps, and Zappooroo is the company I settled on. Their services include programming the full application stack, for iOS and Android, and covering the costs and responsibilities of hosting the app's backend for the first full year.
Having never built something quite like this before, I felt it was important to get this high level of professional help. If I overestimate my abilities, if I bite off more than I can chew, and the app turns into an unreliable mess, it will never take off. I've seen too many apps fail that way.
So I talked with the people at Zaporoo about my idea, and they loved it! I spent a few thousand dollars of my own money on the initial design phase, and everything they've shown me looks great, and has convinced me that they understand the game itself, and how best to bring it to market.

Eat Poop You Cat - Blueprint Diagram
Now it's time to move forward with actually building the app, but the $20,000 price tag is out of reach for me to fund personally.  So that's why I'm turning to the crowdfunding community for help!
I've been a fan of crowdfunding for years, and I've personally pledged more than $8,500 to hundreds of different projects. I've seen the power crowdfunding has to build communities, to help creators connect to their patrons, to and bring fabulous new ideas to life. I can't tell you how excited I am to see that magic happen with a project of my very own!
Cheers, friends! And thank you so much for your help!

They are prepared in advance, applied to bandages, and made available for the player to consume at any time, even in the midst of combat. When crafting Regen Salves, only one ingredient and one solvent will be used for each. The ingredient determines which type of salve is being crafted and the base potency of the salve.

Some grant special abilities, like underwater breathing. Ingredients do not help determine potency as with regen salves; instead, they determine type. Some will be swallowed, others rubbed on, and yet others will be consumed by other methods of ingestion. The recipes for these stat salves will be imparted via scrolls, Guides, and other sources of information in-game.<div>

<span><div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Druid seeks balance and communion with nature, preferring the company of the rugged wilds to “civilized” society. As the Druid, your finely toned muscles and self awareness give you the capability to render powerful strikes, while your unique understanding of the living world allows you to use nature to your advantage. Using vines to ensnare, drag, throw and travel, the Druid can manipulate the battlefield by summoning forth life-giving energies to self-heal, and growth to cause plants to grow and retaliate against the corrupted foes of humanity and nature. The Druid can also call upon the spirits of the local wildlife, allowing them to see through the eyes of a chosen beast and use it as a conduit for destroying the desecrators of the wilds. Not only can the Druid call upon animals to fight, they can even become one. </span></div></span>

Wielding a combination of bows, glaives, small daggers and other unique projectiles, the Ranger takes down enemies from afar before even being spotted. Once assaulted, the Ranger quickly switches to use dual daggers, and goes about dispatching enemies in close range with ease, darting across the battlefield. As the Ranger, you will possess quick reflexes and unparalleled speed, enabling you to run circles around enemies, spreading death wherever you step. The tradeoff is that you won't take damage very well.</span></p>Always being one for speed and agility over strength, the Ranger thrives in the fast pace and adrenaline of combat. As they dodge more attacks, and score hit after hit at fast pace, the Ranger becomes increasingly focused. Eventually, they fall into a deadly cadence, allowing them to ignore both pain and fatigue, and experience infinite stamina.</div>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>The Paladin is an indomitable force on the battlefield. With strength unparalleled, they move slowly, conviction in every ground-shaking step. As the Paladin, you will down foes with heavy strikes using large one- and two-handed weapons. Being a defender of the weak, it is only fitting that you wield large shields in addition to heavy weapons, and focus on repelling enemy attacks before launching your own devastating blows. With such large weapons and shields, overwhelming to the average obstacle, the Paladin’s strikes send enemies flying, or leave them stunned and vulnerable. </span></p>Wading straight into the midst of battles others might evade, the Paladin thrives off of the ability to prevent and block enemy attacks. With every attack blocked, the Paladin gains confidence, building up to become an unstoppable force (for a time).</div>

<p>Thriving in close quarters combat, the Swordsman dual wields slicing, piercing weapons and uses maneuverable two handers to slay foes with abandon.

With every hit scored, the Swordsman’s rage increases, making their hits increasingly damaging, and eventually entering an enraged bloodlust.

<p>Master of the magical arts, the Arcanist uses superior intellect and the power of their weapons to bend the five forces of the world to their will. With terrifying displays of power, the Arcanist strikes fear into the hearts of foes great and little. The Arcanist thrives on this fear which serves to fuel her determination to win, turning her into a catalyst for destruction. If you’re looking for a class able to defeat several enemies in a single, well-placed blow, the Arcanist is for you! </p>
<p>The Arcanist is righteous and cold, using calculated strategies to manipulate the battlefield. Causing confusion and chaos enables the Arcanist to move in and finish foes with quick slashes of a sword, or to create space if they get too close. The Arcanist is not only a living artillery, able to down targets from a distance, they are also a stealthy assassin. Both of these characteristics are integral parts to the Arcanist's prowess in battle.</p>

They fashioned their followers’ societies in ways that satisfied their own selfish pleasures. They cared little for the quality of the lives that their human followers led, only that they remained great in number; for a God’s power is drawn from the number of its followers. The one exception to this divine selfishness was Aderyn. Aderyn took pleasure in watching the humans build, and was proud of their creations and artwork. He discovered that the individual will of the humans was stronger than that imparted to them by external pressure and decided to nurture it, not challenge it. With his Force of Light, he lit the soulfires, divinely-imbued lanterns in his temples which housed the energy of ancestors' souls, giving humans free will, intuition, and inspiration to create. Aderians became renowned as master craftsmen. With the soulfires’ light gleaming like beacons over Anora, many foreigners began to flock to Aderyn’s Cradle and turn away from their original gods. Their influence gaining, Aderyn’s followers began to carry his charm, a round and bright jewel that signified their god’s will guiding their path.</span></p>

Hastily, they decided to join forces and overthrow their sibling. Thus began the Soulfire Crisis, an event which changed Anora forever.</span></p>

As the blood of the faithful Aderians soaked the soil of their Cradle, the Jealous Four sensed Aderyn's power wane. Their divine smiting decimated the Aderian population. Their plan was working. Soon, Aderyn would be weak enough to defeat.</span></p>

Finally, they extinguished the hated soulfires, destroying Aderyn’s last link with Their beloved people. To ensure Aderyn’s permanent defeat, the Four trapped him in a great citadel, located at the heart of his land, and together banished Aderyn’s Cradle to another plane of existence. All that remains to commemorate Aderyn’s lost land is a great gaping crater in the face of Anora, an example of what happens should anyone defy the will of the gods. </span></p>

To the far west of the Cradle lie its scorched sands, and badlands, inhabited by a mix of aquatically-influenced plants and animals. During the Soulfire crisis, the land was smote by Ryphae’s force of Stone, causing enormous crevasses to rend the land and desiccating its already-scant water sources. The arid landscape of the Desert contains sky-high cliffs and formidable mesas with cities built through their windswept caves. Majestic Vika, pictured above, is one such city. Its citizens became famously fascinated with sound and how it bounced off rock; how it echoed deep in the caverns they called ‘home’. They carved and hung special instruments in the caverns of their city that hummed with air currents and harnessed the sounds for record keeping, entertainment, and even magic. </span></p>

<p>The person smiles, unable to suppress a chuckle at the look on your face. “Be at ease, Oracle, I am a priest of Aderyn. You’ve heard from Them, right?” You nod… Aderyn… Yes, that was how the voice introduced itself, the voice that’s been speaking from somewhere inside your own spirit, guiding you through the journey. “Well, They hinted that you’d be coming along. I’m to be your guide for a bit.”</p>
<p>“How did you live?” Until this moment, you’d been certain that you were the only human alive in all the Cradle. The wilds had long since grown over and through all the settlements you’d found, each one completely empty. At every turn, there’ve been only twisted creatures, corrupted humanoids, or harsh wilderness to greet you.</p>

<p>“Well, the Maker worked wonders to keep just a handful of us alive…”</p>
<p>The priest recounts Aderyn’s final moments of power. Knowing that time was running out, and his siblings’ wrath would soon descend, Aderyn acted swiftly to split Their remaining essence into pieces. Four faithful followers were chosen to carry these essences, a sliver of Aderyn's power entrusted to each. They were tasked with the burden of carrying on his culture, and were the last hope that Aderyn would one day return to Anora. Anointed by Aderyn's Light, they have been made immune to the horrid magic he knew the other deities would use to twist and destroy the others, and the land itself. Aderyn promised them a savior; a new Oracle who would bring the Cradle out of darkness. Since the Soulfire Crisis, the four priests have been living in the desolate Cradle, patiently and faithfully awaiting the player’s arrival. </p>These chosen priests, known to the player as the Guides, are the only four humans the player will meet in the entire game. The Guides are sources of quests, weapons, and an immense wealth of knowledge concerning the past and present of the Cradle. From them you’ll receive an abundance of informative lore, important resources, witty quips and good cooking!</div>

<p>Here are just a few examples of imbalanced conditions in the land where mana can be found:</p>
<p>A large forest fire ravaged a partition of the Bayou causing much death and destruction of living organisms. Because of the sudden imbalance, Life Mana begins to seep from the land.The corruption of Nitima spawned a fissure of lava to form in the Icelands. Because of now-extreme heat of the area, Fire mana continuously bleeds from the opening, around the steady lava flow.</p>
<p>A devastating mudslide caused deforestation in a segment of the Quarry. The massive release of energy exerted in the disaster, Stone Mana accumulates in the central area of impact.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There are various types and forms of Kami in Aderyn’s Cradle. In essence, they are the physical manifestations of any one of the Five Forces. They are created from the collective consciousness of either a single species or an entire biome. The species (or biome) must come into contact with mana in order to spawn a kami. The kami will be a kami of whichever Force spawned the mana, giving it not only unique abilities arising from the Force, but also a nearly indestructible physical form, both stronger and wiser than any individual of its species (or biome). Once created, they do not die or disintegrate on their own, and can exist for thousands of years. </span></p>
<p>Aderyn's people believed the kami to be eternal, and their attitudes towards the beings ranged from reverent to superstitious to disbelieving. Druidic legends tell of kami possessing the powers of the Gods, and speculate that the human Gods, Acie, Nitima, Ostia, Ryphae and Aderyn, were born from the same forces which create kami. </p>

Their exposure to mana in the environment, whether sustained or instantaneous, alters their developmental patterns, causing them to develop into altered forms which can better coexist with and exploit the mutating Force. Post-Soulfire Crisis, their numbers dramatically increased in the ruined Cradle, correlating with the sudden jump in mana spawn.

<h2>Use of Funds</h2>
<div>
<p>We are coming to Indiegogo to ask for funding to build a proper vertical slice of <i>Aderyn’s Cradle</i> which will give a more accurate view of gameplay. What will this “vertical slice” look like? It’ll be a section of our Icelands open world environment, complete with demonstrations of all main in-game elements. Through it, we will showcase our combat, weapon augment application, lore, an environment-based movement puzzle, and more!  Once this vertical slice is done, we will be expanding our crowdfunding to encompass all remaining funds needed to finish the game.</p>Specifically, we will be using the funds received from the current IndieGoGo campaign to create in-game assets and to compensate freelance artists for the work we need to finish the vertical slice.  Additionally, these funds will be used to cover the costs of software, technology and other enterprise applications that are needed to get the job done. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our plan is simple: to use the funds bestowed by all of you who are already part of the vision of <i>Cradle</i> to create a clear and full showing of<i> </i>it so as to share its vision with the rest of the gaming community and with potential investors. If we have clear communication of the game's vision alongside this key vertical slice, we are confident that we'll be able to secure the rest of the funds needed to finish <i>Aderyn's Cradle</i>.</div>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
<div>
<p>1. Will <i>Aderyn’s Cradle </i>be released on consoles?</p>

<p>6. Anora is a new fantasy universe of your own creation? Cool! This isn’t going to be another needlessly whitewashed world steeped in gender stereotypes, is it? </p>
<p><i>Aderyn’s Cradle</i> is committed to avoiding whitewashing and gender stereotypes as we create Anora! We have artistic and narrative guidelines in place so that the balance of complexions, body types, ages and other physical features stays heterogenous, similar to the population of the United States, as we bring the Aderian population to life. The same goes for our characters’ other attributes. No matter how they express their sexual orientations or gender identities, we strive to both be aware of stereotypes and transcend them. All in all, our Story and Art Teams take the goals of creating a rich culture and diverse populace for Aderyn’s beloved followers seriously. This is just another measure in our goal to bring you a fantasy experience that is relatable, robust, immersive and inspiring.  </p>

</div></div>","Aderyn’s Cradle (""Cradle"" for short) is the next step in fantasy first-person RPG gameplay. You are the Oracle, the last link to a long-lost god. Your adventure through the Cradle will force you to grapple the polarizing forces of the Holy Trifecta:  humanity, nature and the gods. Throughout your journey, you will uncover the history of Aderyn’s Cradle piece by piece through completing quests and puzzles, fighting anomalies, and exploring the natural world and intricate ruins of the Aderian civilization. To complete your mission, you must harness the power of the five forces through Mana, the lifeblood of Anora, in order to perform powerful magic. Along the way, you will fight the corrupted creatures who would use these same forces against you. Together with the Guides, you will ultimately bring Aderyn’s Cradle back to Anora and restore balance to the lost land.Cradle will immerse you in smooth, realistic, intuitive combat, so that progression through our intellectually rich and emotionally resonant narrative campaign is as exciting as can be. We don’t just want you to buy our game; we want you enjoy it enough to play from start to finish, and again, and again, until you’ve experienced every piece of the lore, the environment, and their rewards. This project is an ambitious one for an independent studio with no large backers, which can only offer royalty checks and company shares as compensation for the hard work of creating this game. In order to meet the goal of a 2017 release, we must succeed through crowdfunding alone at this early stage of production. Nonetheless, production will not halt even if our crowdfunders do not meet their bottom line. Thanks to the dedication of the core team of Mojo's leaders, and their determination to see this project through, production will continue on the face of financial setbacks. Without proper funding, however, the pace of production will be slow, and the 2017 release surely pushed back.We won’t cut any corners, nor settle for a minimum viable product. Our goal,  In short, is to bring you the very best of everything, from visuals and mechanics to story and sound. We are a company made for gamers, by gamers. With Cradle, we aim not just to create something fun, but to drive the medium of videogames forward as an art form. We hope you’ll share our vision!Basics:

Aderyn’s Cradle is a first-person action/adventure role playing game (RPG) with a unique combat system. There will be six weapons available for each of the five character classes, and each weapon has a unique set of attacks. This grants each class a well-rounded strategic toolbox to set up a multitude of combos and fighting styles suited for the player’s chosen character class. A large variety of possible battlefield scenarios exist in Cradle. An intuitive, yet intricate aiming/blocking/parrying system prevents fighting from becoming monotonous and repetitive, even allowing the player to throw fakes like a true duelist. On top of all of this, Aderyn’s Cradle features a groundbreaking, fast-paced system for melee combat called RealFight Combat™. The system uses deterministic animations, which execute different animation sequences depending on where the player aims on an opponent, and what type of opponent is being faced. The amount of damage dealt is dependent on the location of a successful strike rather than randomly generated values. The system is easy to pick up, but challenging to master. Combat in Cradle requires the use of strategically applied augments (weapon and armor upgrades), weapon choices, attacks, and movements. Augments will be unlocked as the player progresses through the game. Weapon and armor customization through augmentation keeps fighting visually stunning and makes it a magical experience. This is going to be a lot of fun!Weapon augments are an essential part of both progression and combat in Aderyn’s Cradle. They link together the powers of humanity, nature and the gods to increase a weapon’s strength. Weapon augments may be acquired through the discovery of secrets, puzzle-solving, or defeating powerful enemies. The different types of augments are representative of the five forces of Anora. Up to five augments can be applied to each weapon. Effects of augments are permanent. Augments have three different levels which determine their strengths and grant special abilities.A sample Fire Augment sequence for the Druid’s Healing Staff. Level 1 increases hit damage with the weapon. Level 2 increases hit damage further, and adds a damage over time effect to attacks. Level 3 increases all weapon damage, and causes single target attacks to include an area of effect burn on every second attack.The premise is simple: each character has a base level of armor to defend against physical and magical damage. In Aderyn’s Cradle, all armor consists of five different attributes that contribute to the abilities of the player’s character. These attributes are:
Physical Resistance: The player’s immunity to physical harm.
Magic Resistance: The player’s immunity to magic and poison.

Swiftness: The amount of energy consumed by the player’s movement.
Stability: The ability of the player to withstand knockback, stun, and staggering blows.
Stealth: The ability of the player to go unnoticed and undetected.
These attributes can be strengthened through the use of Armor Augments, which are materials acquired by the player and applied to a set or portion of armor, causing it to increase in stats. Armor changes in appearance depending on what stats the player chooses to upgrade. All characters start with different base levels of each attribute depending on the player’s chosen class.

Medica is the alchemy system of Cradle. Our aim in making it an intuitive, easy-to-use system is to add extra incentive to exploring our rich open world. Ingredients are found throughout the four open worlds in a variety of physical forms. When picked up, they’re stored in an ingredients pouch alongside bandages. They come in the many forms of useful stones, liquids, species of plants, fungi, and creatures which can all be harvested and stored in inventory. Solvents are liquids only, and are gathered in a waterskin; up to three can be carried at a time. To create a salve, the player combines the ingredient(s) and the solvent in a mortar and pestle, and then heats the mixture over a flame. Discovering effective combinations of ingredients and finding the right recipes is key to taking advantage of the Medica system's full potential.



Medica allows for the crafting of two types of salves. The ingredient list determines the type of salve and its effects, while the solvent used determines its power level. Regeneration (regen) salves are consumed in-combat to restore depleted resources such as health or stamina. Stat salves are consumed to provide permanent boons to player attributes, such as health regeneration or fall damage reduction. Regen salves can serve to restore either health or stamina. They are prepared in advance, applied to bandages, and made available for the player to consume at any time, even in the midst of combat. When crafting Regen Salves, only one ingredient and one solvent will be used for each. The ingredient determines which type of salve is being crafted and the base potency of the salve. The solvent acts to multiply the base potency as determined by the ingredient. The overall level of the salve is calculated by multiplying the base potency of the ingredient by the multiplicative potency of the solvent.Stat salves yield permanent buffs to the player, and are best used as soon as they’re made.  Their ingredients are very rare, and far greater in variety than regen salves. Some grant special abilities, like underwater breathing. Ingredients do not help determine potency as with regen salves; instead, they determine type. Some will be swallowed, others rubbed on, and yet others will be consumed by other methods of ingestion. The recipes for these stat salves will be imparted via scrolls, Guides, and other sources of information in-game.



The Oracle is the only human in the world capable of hearing Aderyn’s voice in a clear, real way. Aderyn (aka The Maker, aka Deity of Hands, aka One Who Moves the Heavens, aka Master of Craft and Light) is only able to communicate abstractly with every one of his other followers. No matter how devout or willing they are, they can never understand Aderyn and be as intimately connected with them as you are; even though when the campaign begins, you don’t even know Their name. This is why They are able to guide you so readily through the steps you must take. When They speak, it is like a voice coming from somewhere deep within yourself you cannot reach or control. The Voice of Aderyn comes when you need it; it’s silent when you don't.





In the ages before the Soulfire Crisis, the Oracle was the supreme spiritual leader of the land; a person revered as the direct voice of Aderyn on Earth. She or he acted as ambassador between humanity and the gods for the Aderian people and was, as a result, the single most powerful individual in the Cradle. Once identified and anointed into their sacred, sovereign role, oracles served until their death. Each  oracle was said to be a craftsman who embodies the traits of Aderyn most: free will, creativity, and perfected skill. The Oracle wears a sacred textile, said to be spun by the Maker Them-self. The player uses this cloth as a medium through which the energies of the Holy Trifecta (gods/humanity/nature) can be channelled to make weapon upgrades. 



Through the game’s highly responsive movement and combat system, the player will be able to truly feel like a relentless Swordsman, nimble Ranger, daunting Paladin, dynamic Druid, or devastating Arcanist. Players may choose to play as either a male or a female character, no matter which class is picked. Each class has a unique movement pace, designed to compliment their various combat styles. Each class also has their own unique type of armor, and each armor type can be customized and augmented by the player to enhance their stats.



The Druid seeks balance and communion with nature, preferring the company of the rugged wilds to “civilized” society. As the Druid, your finely toned muscles and self awareness give you the capability to render powerful strikes, while your unique understanding of the living world allows you to use nature to your advantage. Using vines to ensnare, drag, throw and travel, the Druid can manipulate the battlefield by summoning forth life-giving energies to self-heal, and growth to cause plants to grow and retaliate against the corrupted foes of humanity and nature. The Druid can also call upon the spirits of the local wildlife, allowing them to see through the eyes of a chosen beast and use it as a conduit for destroying the desecrators of the wilds. Not only can the Druid call upon animals to fight, they can even become one.

At home in the shadows, the Ranger is inspired by ninjas and marksmen. Wielding a combination of bows, glaives, small daggers and other unique projectiles, the Ranger takes down enemies from afar before even being spotted. Once assaulted, the Ranger quickly switches to use dual daggers, and goes about dispatching enemies in close range with ease, darting across the battlefield. As the Ranger, you will possess quick reflexes and unparalleled speed, enabling you to run circles around enemies, spreading death wherever you step. The tradeoff is that you won't take damage very well.Always being one for speed and agility over strength, the Ranger thrives in the fast pace and adrenaline of combat. As they dodge more attacks, and score hit after hit at fast pace, the Ranger becomes increasingly focused. Eventually, they fall into a deadly cadence, allowing them to ignore both pain and fatigue, and experience infinite stamina.

The Paladin is an indomitable force on the battlefield. With strength unparalleled, they move slowly, conviction in every ground-shaking step. As the Paladin, you will down foes with heavy strikes using large one- and two-handed weapons. Being a defender of the weak, it is only fitting that you wield large shields in addition to heavy weapons, and focus on repelling enemy attacks before launching your own devastating blows. With such large weapons and shields, overwhelming to the average obstacle, the Paladin’s strikes send enemies flying, or leave them stunned and vulnerable. Wading straight into the midst of battles others might evade, the Paladin thrives off of the ability to prevent and block enemy attacks. With every attack blocked, the Paladin gains confidence, building up to become an unstoppable force (for a time).

Thriving in close quarters combat, the Swordsman dual wields slicing, piercing weapons and uses maneuverable two handers to slay foes with abandon. With a powerful shout, the swordsman will rush even the most dangerous of foes with a powerful battle charge. As a Swordsman, you ignore pain, thriving on every hit an enemy throws at you, especially when you take only light damage. With every hit scored, the Swordsman’s rage increases, making their hits increasingly damaging, and eventually entering an enraged bloodlust. When in this state, the Swordsman gains health with every enemy slain.

Master of the magical arts, the Arcanist uses superior intellect and the power of their weapons to bend the five forces of the world to their will. With terrifying displays of power, the Arcanist strikes fear into the hearts of foes great and little. The Arcanist thrives on this fear which serves to fuel her determination to win, turning her into a catalyst for destruction. If you’re looking for a class able to defeat several enemies in a single, well-placed blow, the Arcanist is for you! 
The Arcanist is righteous and cold, using calculated strategies to manipulate the battlefield. Causing confusion and chaos enables the Arcanist to move in and finish foes with quick slashes of a sword, or to create space if they get too close. The Arcanist is not only a living artillery, able to down targets from a distance, they are also a stealthy assassin. Both of these characteristics are integral parts to the Arcanist's prowess in battle.

In ages past, the world of Anora was home to five Cradles. Each of the five deities ruled their own Cradle.
Aderyn is the deity of hands, craft and Light Force.

Nitima is the deity of heart, passion, and Fire
Force.


Ostia is the deity of mouth, hunger, and Life Force.


Ryphae is the deity of brain, intellect, and Stone Force.


Acie is the deity of eyes, perception, and Fluid Force.


The Five Gods shaped their lands, their respective Cradles, in unique ways. They fashioned their followers’ societies in ways that satisfied their own selfish pleasures. They cared little for the quality of the lives that their human followers led, only that they remained great in number; for a God’s power is drawn from the number of its followers. The one exception to this divine selfishness was Aderyn. Aderyn took pleasure in watching the humans build, and was proud of their creations and artwork. He discovered that the individual will of the humans was stronger than that imparted to them by external pressure and decided to nurture it, not challenge it. With his Force of Light, he lit the soulfires, divinely-imbued lanterns in his temples which housed the energy of ancestors' souls, giving humans free will, intuition, and inspiration to create. Aderians became renowned as master craftsmen. With the soulfires’ light gleaming like beacons over Anora, many foreigners began to flock to Aderyn’s Cradle and turn away from their original gods. Their influence gaining, Aderyn’s followers began to carry his charm, a round and bright jewel that signified their god’s will guiding their path.

Aderyn’s siblings seethed with jealousy as they watched his followers swell in number. Hastily, they decided to join forces and overthrow their sibling. Thus began the Soulfire Crisis, an event which changed Anora forever.



A massive battle ensued between the followers of Aderyn and those of the other four deities. As the blood of the faithful Aderians soaked the soil of their Cradle, the Jealous Four sensed Aderyn's power wane. Their divine smiting decimated the Aderian population. Their plan was working. Soon, Aderyn would be weak enough to defeat.

Those of Aderyn’s loyal people who did not perish outright suffered an even crueler fate: they were twisted and corrupted, painfully separated from their own humanity, so that only their altered bodies remained as the rest of their humanity was consumed.


Showing no mercy, the Jealous Four divided Aderyn’s Cradle, one piece for each, warping and twisting it into an aberration of its former beauty, altering the creatures into monsters, destroying countless wonders of craftsmanship built by Aderians. Finally, they extinguished the hated soulfires, destroying Aderyn’s last link with Their beloved people. To ensure Aderyn’s permanent defeat, the Four trapped him in a great citadel, located at the heart of his land, and together banished Aderyn’s Cradle to another plane of existence. All that remains to commemorate Aderyn’s lost land is a great gaping crater in the face of Anora, an example of what happens should anyone defy the will of the gods. 













The serene and grandiose Cathedral of Aderyn acts as the hub level and home base of the player’s journey. It contains a workshop for armor augments, a library for accessing discovered lore, a crafting station for medica, and portals to each of the four open worlds. As beautiful as it is mysterious, the Cathedral also contains special areas of its own, waiting to be explored.





The Titanwood lines the border between Ostia’s Cradle and where Aderyn’s Cradle once lay in the world before being banished to the Metaspace. Ostia’s Life Force has caused the trees here to grow abnormally tall, and the forest to overflow with organisms. Once you depart your village, you must flee through this land to reach Aderyn’s shrine, so that Aderyn can transport you to the ruined Cradle.  



The Icelands are one of the four open worlds of Aderyn’s Cradle. In the northernmost reaches of the Cradle lay the Icelands, home to glacial caverns, snow-capped peaks, active volcanoes and hot springs. The Aderians who lived here studied the advantages of geothermal technology, and made themselves expert engineers. They were famous for crafting ways to use the natural heat of volcanoes to power their formidable forges in the pursuit of craft to honor Aderyn. Even before the Crisis, this unforgiving environment proved challenging for all but the most rugged lifeforms. 




Now, the land is razed by Nitima’s Fire Force. Areas of extreme heat and chill tear the countryside apart with abyssal rifts, constructing a myriad of natural obstacles to surmount. Gargantuan fields of lava and active volcanoes now dominate the scenic expanses of mountain tundra, where the highest peaks in the Cradle contrast with abyssal moulins cut deep in the permafrost. The player must beat back Nitima’s corruption in this hazardous environment of ice and fire!




The Bayou is one of the four open worlds of Aderyn’s Cradle. Before the Soulfire Crisis, the Bayou was a dense fungal forest and a thriving ecosystem, populated by enormous mushrooms, strange plants and large, exotic insects. It was home to bustling centers of trade, and the wilderness overflowed with precious materials ripe for collection. Among the most valuable were the unusual woods which come from the trunks of fungal trees.  Diverse groups of merchants, craftsmen, and tradesmen from all over Anora gathered in its bustling towns to peddle their wares. During the Crisis, the land was smote by Ostia’s Life force. 





The Bayou in ruins has been twisted by overgrowth, with every creature, fungus, and fungal plant competing for survival. Human ruins have been totally reclaimed by natural forces, and fungus covers every available surface. Once-docile creatures have been transformed into formidable monstrosities, like the Swamp Stalker. Though foreboding, the Bayou is sure to awaken a fervent wanderlust in you, just as for the Aderian adventurers of old who first ventured into its depths in the name of freedom and craft.






The Quarry is one of the four open worlds of Aderyn’s Cradle. The lush and expansive forest of the Quarry once contained a variety of plants, wildlife, and some of the most prosperous industrial regions known to Anora. Following the Soulfire Crisis, the deity Acie transmuted and flooded the land, corrupting it with their force of Fluid. Tropical forests shrouded in mist, waterfalls, hidden caves, flooded settlements and mines can all be explored in this environment. 





Remnants of broken-down machinery, pools of water tinted orange with rust, and small mining hamlets populate the mountains and valleys. Eroding gear and pulley systems that were once used for hoisting large rocks and minerals out of the ground will serve as tools for environment-based puzzles, and can be exploited creatively in combat.




The Desert is one of the four open worlds of Aderyn’s Cradle. To the far west of the Cradle lie its scorched sands, and badlands, inhabited by a mix of aquatically-influenced plants and animals. During the Soulfire crisis, the land was smote by Ryphae’s force of Stone, causing enormous crevasses to rend the land and desiccating its already-scant water sources. The arid landscape of the Desert contains sky-high cliffs and formidable mesas with cities built through their windswept caves. Majestic Vika, pictured above, is one such city. Its citizens became famously fascinated with sound and how it bounced off rock; how it echoed deep in the caverns they called ‘home’. They carved and hung special instruments in the caverns of their city that hummed with air currents and harnessed the sounds for record keeping, entertainment, and even magic. 



Much of the sound was distorted following the Crisis, by Ryphae’s corrupting stones altering the perfectly-sculpted shapes of caves and cliffs. The player will seek clues from the past as echoes of ancient music float on howling wind.







You traverse the emptied lands of Aderyn. Having beaten your latest enemies, you rest in your sleeping sack and gaze at the stars. In this odd world, victim of divine smiting, you cannot help but wonder… Did anyone else survive?
You don’t have long to wonder. A face has appeared out of nowhere, and you are nose-to-nose with another human, the first you’ve seen in many days of fighting monsters. The seasoned survivalist crept up on you easily! “Who are you?!” You sputter, caught off-guard to find another living soul in this eerie, ethereal place. 



Charon, one of the four guides you will meet in Aderyn's Cradle.

The person smiles, unable to suppress a chuckle at the look on your face. “Be at ease, Oracle, I am a priest of Aderyn. You’ve heard from Them, right?” You nod… Aderyn… Yes, that was how the voice introduced itself, the voice that’s been speaking from somewhere inside your own spirit, guiding you through the journey. “Well, They hinted that you’d be coming along. I’m to be your guide for a bit.”
“How did you live?” Until this moment, you’d been certain that you were the only human alive in all the Cradle. The wilds had long since grown over and through all the settlements you’d found, each one completely empty. At every turn, there’ve been only twisted creatures, corrupted humanoids, or harsh wilderness to greet you.
The person’s face falls, remembering all the others lost in the Soulfire Crisis.



“Well, the Maker worked wonders to keep just a handful of us alive…”
The priest recounts Aderyn’s final moments of power. Knowing that time was running out, and his siblings’ wrath would soon descend, Aderyn acted swiftly to split Their remaining essence into pieces. Four faithful followers were chosen to carry these essences, a sliver of Aderyn's power entrusted to each. They were tasked with the burden of carrying on his culture, and were the last hope that Aderyn would one day return to Anora. Anointed by Aderyn's Light, they have been made immune to the horrid magic he knew the other deities would use to twist and destroy the others, and the land itself. Aderyn promised them a savior; a new Oracle who would bring the Cradle out of darkness. Since the Soulfire Crisis, the four priests have been living in the desolate Cradle, patiently and faithfully awaiting the player’s arrival. These chosen priests, known to the player as the Guides, are the only four humans the player will meet in the entire game. The Guides are sources of quests, weapons, and an immense wealth of knowledge concerning the past and present of the Cradle. From them you’ll receive an abundance of informative lore, important resources, witty quips and good cooking!





Anora is the world in which Aderyn’s Cradle is set. The Five main types of mana correlate to the Five main forces; the energetic signatures that make up all matter in Anora. These forces are harnessed by the player to produce special effects on the player's weapons, and power magic-based attacks. These five forces are the energies that make up the world of Anora and provide the energy of its existence.

Life: The lifeforce of all living things in the land. It is the pulse of Anora. 
  In the absence of Life is Decay.
Fire: The force of heat and flame. It is the radiant energy of Anora.
  In the absence of Fire is Chill.
Light: The force of pure energy that fills the void. It is the spiritual strength of Anora.
  In the absence of Light is Darkness.
Fluid: The force of liquids and gases. It is the ebbing and flowing energy of Anora.
  In the absence of Fluid is Stillness.
Stone: The force of all the land. It is the material strength of Anora.
 In the absence of Stone is Disintegration, or space.





The Mana carrier, also functions as a torch.
Here are just a few examples of imbalanced conditions in the land where mana can be found:
A large forest fire ravaged a partition of the Bayou causing much death and destruction of living organisms. Because of the sudden imbalance, Life Mana begins to seep from the land.The corruption of Nitima spawned a fissure of lava to form in the Icelands. Because of now-extreme heat of the area, Fire mana continuously bleeds from the opening, around the steady lava flow.
A devastating mudslide caused deforestation in a segment of the Quarry. The massive release of energy exerted in the disaster, Stone Mana accumulates in the central area of impact.




There are various types and forms of Kami in Aderyn’s Cradle. In essence, they are the physical manifestations of any one of the Five Forces. They are created from the collective consciousness of either a single species or an entire biome. The species (or biome) must come into contact with mana in order to spawn a kami. The kami will be a kami of whichever Force spawned the mana, giving it not only unique abilities arising from the Force, but also a nearly indestructible physical form, both stronger and wiser than any individual of its species (or biome). Once created, they do not die or disintegrate on their own, and can exist for thousands of years. 
Aderyn's people believed the kami to be eternal, and their attitudes towards the beings ranged from reverent to superstitious to disbelieving. Druidic legends tell of kami possessing the powers of the Gods, and speculate that the human Gods, Acie, Nitima, Ostia, Ryphae and Aderyn, were born from the same forces which create kami. 







In certain areas of perpetual violent or dynamic geology/ecology, there is constantly mana bleeding in the area; this is how elementals, sometimes called ""land kami"" are born, some occupying Anora perpetually. A certain number of kami will always exist in areas of localized imbalance, whether from environmental phenomena, mana bleeding, or an imbalance in a population of living creatures. Some kami in-game will be enemies, while others might aid the player or remain neutral.






Anomalies are physically altered versions of natural animals and plants. They spawn when individuals are exposed to mana. Mostly, they are isolated cases. Their exposure to mana in the environment, whether sustained or instantaneous, alters their developmental patterns, causing them to develop into altered forms which can better coexist with and exploit the mutating Force. Post-Soulfire Crisis, their numbers dramatically increased in the ruined Cradle, correlating with the sudden jump in mana spawn. They are the corrupted creatures of Aderyn’s land, and most become enemies for the player to fight as they journey.




Various creatures compared to the five player classes.


The Swamp Stalker


Born of Light, God of Creation
Born of Light energy, Aderyn embodies both the momentary inspirations that drive creativity from perception, as well as the long-simmering intuitions that come to creative fruition over time. They represent both intuition and free will. Aderyn possesses and alights Their followers’ intuition; to enable this, They have buit a society that unconditionally protects free will and craft above all else. Aderyn is the deity of Creation, who creates soulfires for which humans create material containers. To inspire creativity in Aderian followers, Aderyn lit the soulfires, lights in his temples, giving men freedom and will to innovate.




A mere sliver of his essence is what had the power to teleport you all the way from your home in the real, physical realm of Ostia’s Cradle to the ethereal, cursed lands of Aderyn’s Cradle. Aderyn did this because you are the Oracle, the savior he has promised his faithful surviving followers. The Oracle is the one who will restore Aderyn's land to the world and allow Their followers and culture to one day grace Anora again.







Use of Funds

We are coming to Indiegogo to ask for funding to build a proper vertical slice of Aderyn’s Cradle which will give a more accurate view of gameplay. What will this “vertical slice” look like? It’ll be a section of our Icelands open world environment, complete with demonstrations of all main in-game elements. Through it, we will showcase our combat, weapon augment application, lore, an environment-based movement puzzle, and more!  Once this vertical slice is done, we will be expanding our crowdfunding to encompass all remaining funds needed to finish the game.Specifically, we will be using the funds received from the current IndieGoGo campaign to create in-game assets and to compensate freelance artists for the work we need to finish the vertical slice.  Additionally, these funds will be used to cover the costs of software, technology and other enterprise applications that are needed to get the job done. 

Our plan is simple: to use the funds bestowed by all of you who are already part of the vision of Cradle to create a clear and full showing of it so as to share its vision with the rest of the gaming community and with potential investors. If we have clear communication of the game's vision alongside this key vertical slice, we are confident that we'll be able to secure the rest of the funds needed to finish Aderyn's Cradle.

Frequently Asked Questions:

1. Will Aderyn’s Cradle be released on consoles?
Due to the ease of porting Unreal 4 onto next gen consoles, we hope to release Aderyn’s Cradle on console! Most likely this will be the first stretch goal during our Kickstarter campaign or we will include it from the beginning of said campaign.

2. Will Aderyn’s Cradle be released on Mac and Linux?
Currently, we do not plan on supporting Mac or Linux.

3. What Specs will I need to run Aderyn’s Cradle?
TBA; unfortunately, it is too early in development for us to know.

4. Is there magic in Aderyn’s Cradle?
Yes, mana represents the physical manifestations of this magic, the lifeblood of Aderyn’s Cradle and the world of Anora.  The Arcanist wields the 5 forces to devastating effects, with the druid imploring nature magic.

5. Will Aderyn’s Cradle have multiplayer?
Yes.  Initially an add-on which we intended to release after the campaign, multiplayer will come with Aderyn’s Cradle, containing four game modes, CTF, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and King of the Hill, with two modes to play in, Ranked mode, where each class has all 6 weapons, un-augmented for serious competitive play, and an unranked mode, featuring all 6 weapons, augmentable as you choose for some fun practice or with friends.

6. Anora is a new fantasy universe of your own creation? Cool! This isn’t going to be another needlessly whitewashed world steeped in gender stereotypes, is it? 
Aderyn’s Cradle is committed to avoiding whitewashing and gender stereotypes as we create Anora! We have artistic and narrative guidelines in place so that the balance of complexions, body types, ages and other physical features stays heterogenous, similar to the population of the United States, as we bring the Aderian population to life. The same goes for our characters’ other attributes. No matter how they express their sexual orientations or gender identities, we strive to both be aware of stereotypes and transcend them. All in all, our Story and Art Teams take the goals of creating a rich culture and diverse populace for Aderyn’s beloved followers seriously. This is just another measure in our goal to bring you a fantasy experience that is relatable, robust, immersive and inspiring.  

7. Will There be Occulus Rift support?
Yes!

8. When will Aderyn’s Cradle be released?
If all goes according to plan, we will release Aderyn’s Cradle about 2 years from now in Fall 2017!

<p>Hi there, we are Startale Games, an indie studio based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. Our team is made up of two programmers/game designers, and we have been working on creating video games for quite a while now. Our current project ""Claim"" is our first dive into producing a finished product that we feel comfortable showing off to the world.</p>
<p>We have been in development for just around 2 months now and have already made amazing progress. Check out the video to see just how far we have gotten! The core game play is already coded in, so the finishing touches we need to implement are player progression (achievements, rankings, etc) and visual updates. The game will be released for PC, IOS, Andriod, and Switch (Early Access is PC only!).</p>
<p>Your money will go towards purchasing better art for the game as well as marketing. We can do all the coding and game design on our own, but we need you guys to help us make the game both beautiful and popular. All donations lead to a better experience, and more people involved with a project we hope you can get as passionate about as we are.</p>

<p>Claim is a 1v1 turn based strategy game that is played on a 5x11 grid. Each player starts with 2 columns of tiles on opposite ends of the board under their control. They place a castle on one of the tiles they own, and the opponent cannot see where they placed it, much like battleship. Your goal is to place units on your own tiles, move them across the board to claim more tiles, then claim your opponent's tiles, and finally your opponent's castle in order to win the game.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561020435/pd2sugb5kmulpgivw3qb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Tiles are claimed by units when a player ends their turn. There are many different nations, each with their own unique units that will claim different patterns in the board. For example, the Pawn unit will only claim the tile he ends his turn on, but the Monarch unit will claim the tile he is on, the tiles to his sides, and the tile in front of him when the turn ends. An additional element to the game is that you cannot see enemy unless they are claiming tiles, or are on the tiles you control. Because of this, you must pay close attention to how the board is changing, and predict where enemy units are placed.</p>

<p>Before the match starts, each player chooses one of our available nations to play as. Each nation has a completely different theme, and has a unique unit that is only available to them. For example, Green Team gets a catapult unit, while blue team gets a magical druid unit. Each team has a different play-style with strengths and weaknesses. After the player plays enough matches, they will gain access to custom team builder which allows for building a team made up of the units you like the best.</p>

<p>With the individual units, you are able to buy skins for them with the gold you have accumulated inside the game. With our 10$ game price, we are making skins fairly easy to obtain. They will feel like a nice reward after a few matches, not an endless grind. Our goal is not to money off skins, just let people work towards looking cool.</p>
<p>Additionally, players will be able to spend their gold on custom banners, different emotes, and different voice lines. We are trying to let the player customize their experience, and add as much of their personal flair to their games as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, we will have a custom castle builder, where you can spend your gold to get parts. You will be able to drag and place any castle parts you want onto a unique tile that will then be available for use in the game. </p>

We have the code all in place to scale the game exponentially, we just need the money to grab our player base.

Our team is made up of two programmers/game designers, and we have been working on creating video games for quite a while now. Our current project ""Claim"" is our first dive into producing a finished product that we feel comfortable showing off to the world.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The game is already up and running, so, there's no issues there.  As always, in the end, the main risk is that sufficient numbers of people play the game for sufficient periods of time to make it fun and enjoyable.  The mitigation of this risk is that the current Beta has already been played continuously for many months, and the previous game that we were developers on lasted for more than 5 years and had thousands of players</p>

Risks & Challenges
The game is already up and running, so, there's no issues there.  As always, in the end, the main risk is that sufficient numbers of people play the game for sufficient periods of time to make it fun and enjoyable.  The mitigation of this risk is that the current Beta has already been played continuously for many months, and the previous game that we were developers on lasted for more than 5 years and had thousands of players

We love RPGs and we always wanted to have different personalities, traits, backgrounds which lead to interesting choices, conflict and decision that you make. The game begins with you designing your character by choosing the look and the background story for him. This background story will determine your starting positions, social status and traits. During the game, you will get more traits, based on your decisions and actions, which will determine your playstyle and assist you in a role you want to play. Let’s say that you have betrayed the people around you a couple of times and received a Deceitful trait. This trait will invoke more events and opportunities for you to abuse other people around you in your favour.

<li>Tactics represent your expertise in combat, naval and melee</li>

<li>Diplomacy will help you to interact with other captains, negotiate in towns and improve your reputation and credibility around the world.</li>

But this is not as scary as a risk of mutiny on your ship when your crew is dissatisfied with your actions. You want them to like you, especially if your captaincy is not supported by the government, but by the vote of the crew.

<h3><b>The Project.</b></h3>
<p></p><p>I have been a tabletop role play gamer since 1989 and
my first tabletop role play game was ""HeroQuest"". When my friends
forced me to become a ""Dungeon/Game Master"" using d20 system, i
didn't know where to start! Months later I realized that I need a world tool
that instantly provides useful information. At that period I was studying to
get my bachelor degree ""Surveying and
G.I.S. Engineering"" so I made a desktop G.I.S. application for
my campaigns. After I took my bachelor degree, i worked at a G.I.S. company on
many projects in many positions. I developed an Online Web-G.I.S., worked with
databases from start to end, created traffic and urban planning G.I.S. maps and
much more. When I lost my job during the economic crisis I decided to merge my
love for tabletop-RPGs with my profession, so I developed a Fantasy Online
World using G.I.S. (Geographic Information Systems)</p>
<p>Experimentally I uploaded W.O.A.L.M. on a server and I
made a web-site as professional as I could. I made this campaign to cover these
expenses and to keep the project running with upgrades-updates for the next two

<h3><b>Online Web-Geographic Information Systems.</b></h3>
<p></p><p>Creating an Online Web-G.I.S. world tool is a very
difficult task. You know already that W.O.A.L.M. is a fantasy ""Google
Maps"".  ""Google Maps"" has more than 10.000 employees.
W.O.A.L.M. is almost 10 times bigger than Texas, which means it's nearly
as big as Canada and United States together. </p>
<p>All the knowledge someone needs to create a
web-server, a map-server, a web-site and to set them all up to work
correctly requires 0time. I worked almost 31.000 hours for the last 5 years
setting everything up correctly for my users. That means i have already passed
through many difficulties, all of you know that, every time you try to do
something  (even the same task) on a
computer, a new problem might pop-up, but that’s what  life is all about. A great problem to be
solved. </p>

I love what i do but I created
this tool for you! I would like you to participate in my project and help me
make it bigger!<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464710989/Vault1_yryfhe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>I will appreciate any kind of help, so If you would

Currently I have a ""Dedicated Server""
running with ""Server O.S."" and ""Administrator Internet
Panel"" in Europe, an E-mail server, a domain name, SSL Certificates for user's
sensitive data protection. Ticket module for the web-site, web-site forum,
G.I.S. map-server and for all these payments a small company business to be a
legal citizen.
If this campaign will not reach its goal, my first
priority is to keep W.O.A.L.M. online as much time as possible.
If this campaign reaches its goal 
I will set up W.O.A.L.M. on a Canadian or U.S.
Dedicated Server so it will be faster and easier for use by everyone
(Worldwide). That means i will have to maintain and update 2 servers.
Next 2 years plans are to:

Create 442 extra cities maps (44 city maps are
     completed 18 are on the map)
Merge cities maps with the General Map (City maps
     currently redirecting user into a new map)
Create dungeons maps for every ""Cave-Tunnel-Dungeon"" 
Create small objects maps such as Bridges,
     Temples, monuments etc.
Create an Under-LandMap (Tunnels & Caves
     network) 
Write new history information for all the Realms
Update History to the Cities Description
Update Building footprints for different types of
     Buildings

My contributors.
As a G.I.S. world tool, W.O.A.L.M. can provide any
information users might need!
Along with the ""Subscribers Plan"", a month ,
six months, a year or two years of access into W.O.A.L.M. I can use your
name (or your character's name or your nickname) in Lore of W.O.A.L.M. as:

Lord
Knight
Evil Character
Demi-god

 I can create a Tower or a Castle where
you are going to be the owner with a short description of your choice
I can create a city ""2500 Buildings"" Named
by your (Nickname) with a story of your choice (If you don't have any, I will
create a story just for your character). Every citizen will worship you like a God!

Online Web-Geographic Information Systems.
Creating an Online Web-G.I.S. world tool is a very
difficult task. You know already that W.O.A.L.M. is a fantasy ""Google
Maps"".  ""Google Maps"" has more than 10.000 employees.
W.O.A.L.M. is almost 10 times bigger than Texas, which means it's nearly
as big as Canada and United States together. 
All the knowledge someone needs to create a
web-server, a map-server, a web-site and to set them all up to work
correctly requires 0time. I worked almost 31.000 hours for the last 5 years
setting everything up correctly for my users. That means i have already passed
through many difficulties, all of you know that, every time you try to do
something  (even the same task) on a
computer, a new problem might pop-up, but that’s what  life is all about. A great problem to be
solved. 

I love what i do but I created
this tool for you! I would like you to participate in my project and help me
make it bigger!I will appreciate any kind of help, so If you would
like to help in any way (write a story about a Realm or a City, draw a dungeon
map etc.), feel free to contact me through my web-site, e-mail or message me on
social.
Thank you very
much for your time! Please remember to share!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>THE TEAM:</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Nick, and I'm an independent video game programmer. My dream is to, like the dreams of many, become an influential and creative game designer to the best of my abilities. </p>
<p>My current work towards that goal is this project: Post-Spatial Studios.</p>
<p>We currently consist of about 7 or 8 members (total count not final as of yet), including:</p>
<p>*Myself, the creator and aspiring CEO, having some experience in game programming and am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree through a university*</p>
<p>*My sister Antonia, and her roommate Caroline, who are both Digital Art/Graphic Design majors in SUNY Potsdam, a state college in Northern New York, and both of them are fantastic designers in every sense of the word*</p>
<p>*My associates: Cody, the lead writer and designer for storyboard, then there's Mike, also a writer/designer, and Jack, an assistant programmer*</p>
<p>*And also, a few friends who also work in art, design, or programming*</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>THE GOAL:</strong></h3>
<p>We need the above goal met in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire tools for game development</li>
<li>Acquire hardware and software relating to the tools</li>
<li>Establish ourselves as an official business</li>
<li>Start the hypothetical ""engine"" and the fuel that will drive us towards making GREAT games!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>THE REWARDS:</strong></h3>
<p>Every dollar counts towards development, and we are thankful for any donation we may receive! In return, we will offer benefits such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our thanks</li>
<li>Access to special news, notifications, and early access</li>
<li>Betas and Alphas for private testing</li>
<li>Eventually, limited edition physical copies of any games we produce.</li>

<h3>HOW WE USE THE MONEY:</h3>
<p>All the money donated will be stored in a central deposit account which, upon the official establishing of the LLC, will become part of the company's funds.</p>
<p>If we meet our goal, then the community that supports us will be gratefully thanked!</p>
<p>If we don't, then it's not the end of the world for us; We will use what we've got and still see if we can make our grand ideas for great games.</p>

<h3>WHAT IT TAKES:</h3>
<p>Game development, especially when it comes to making a company, is hard. We acknowledge that.

(The ""Prelude"" chapter explains how we're reaching far and wide for myths and folklore from around the world, not just from European origins. And the ""Red Jack"" chapter goes into depth on the kitsune and pipe foxes and murder stone and more.)  </p><p>Here's the quick description of what you'll get:</p><p><b>CAMPAIGN GUIDE: </b>This book has 300+ pages. It contains details on ten fey lords, including their stats and their history and motivations and intrigues. There are new locations (demesnes, cities, planes) detailed for each of the fey lords, plus 40+ statted fey monsters. As stretch goals are unlocked, additional content will be added.  </p><p><b>PLAYER'S GUIDE: </b>This book has 128+ pages. It contains eleven new fey player races. You'll learn the details of each race, what makes them different, and options for playing them. You'll get new archetypes, feats, racial traits, and more, including supernatural abilities unique to each race. (Pathfinder and 5E are being separately, so each will have content specific to that system.) As stretch goals are unlocked, additional content will be added.</p><p><b>MAGIC GUIDE: </b>This book has 64+ pages, and it is a PDF included in the ""ALL PDF"" reward tiers. It will detail the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, providing magical options for players to take part in them and defend themselves from them. There will be new incantations/rituals, spells, strange and unique magic items, and interesting new magical systems, such as the moonshadow (which details how to incorporate the moon's influence on your fey). As stretch goals are unlocked, additional content will be added.</p><p><b>TWO EDITIONS: </b>The books will be created for both Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and for 5E. Material will be converted if applicable, but otherwise, content will be created new for each to match each system's specific mechanics. Backers at a tier that includes ""ALL PDF"" will get the PDFs for both editions. For other PDF tiers and print editions, backers will be able to choose their edition.</p><p><b>STRETCH GOALS: </b>""New Chapter"" stretch goals will add digital content to each of the three core books. ""Module"" stretch goals will be available in ""ALL PDF"" tiers.</p><p><b>""ALL PDF"" TIERS: </b>If you select one of the tiers that says ""ALL PDF"", you will automatically receive (though depending on the tier, possibly more)... </p><ul>

<b>Hob: </b>Silent and mysterious, eldest of the mogwoi lords. As different as they come. </li>
<li>
<b>Jasmine: </b>The Painted Lady. The Cannibal Queen. Driven by her hatred of Mab.</li>
<li>
<b>Manitou: </b>Ancient trickster and horned god of the deep wood. Always looking to the horizon, wondering what’s on the other side. His own greatest foe.</li>
<li>
<b>Korapira: </b>Mistress of the trees; terror in the leaves. Few can match her intensity and drive to get what she wants. She longs to bring her children—the entire plant kingdom—crashing down on the world.</li>
<li>
<b>Wild Hunt: </b>The spirit of nature knows nothing of moderation. It cares nothing for mercy. It feels nothing for civilization. Its goal is survival, and for Slaine and the fir bolg, it is salvation. </li>
<li>
<b>Mab: </b>Queen Mab now speaks always of death, gloom, and the slow passing away of the fey worlds. She has become consumed by her regrets.</li>
<li>
<b>Moaro: </b>A horrific and literal shadow of her former self, this darking is delusional and unpredictable, ever wandering.</li>
<li>
<b>Nemesis: </b>Product of a tragic love story, she is now an uncaring engine of vengeance.</li>
<li>
<b>Flibbertigibbet: </b>Clown prince of the mogwoi! Master of gremlins! Unintentional destroyer of worlds!</li>

(Pathfinder and 5E are being separately, so each will have content specific to that system.) As stretch goals are unlocked, additional content will be added.MAGIC GUIDE: This book has 64+ pages, and it is a PDF included in the ""ALL PDF"" reward tiers. It will detail the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, providing magical options for players to take part in them and defend themselves from them. There will be new incantations/rituals, spells, strange and unique magic items, and interesting new magical systems, such as the moonshadow (which details how to incorporate the moon's influence on your fey). As stretch goals are unlocked, additional content will be added.TWO EDITIONS: The books will be created for both Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and for 5E. Material will be converted if applicable, but otherwise, content will be created new for each to match each system's specific mechanics. Backers at a tier that includes ""ALL PDF"" will get the PDFs for both editions. For other PDF tiers and print editions, backers will be able to choose their edition.STRETCH GOALS: ""New Chapter"" stretch goals will add digital content to each of the three core books. ""Module"" stretch goals will be available in ""ALL PDF"" tiers.""ALL PDF"" TIERS: If you select one of the tiers that says ""ALL PDF"", you will automatically receive (though depending on the tier, possibly more)... 
PDFs of the Campaign, Player's, and Magic Guides 
12 fey adventures in 2016 (and any other PDF we publish for The Faerie Ring in 2016)
You will receive PDFs of both editions, Pathfinder and 5E. In addition, you will also receive any additional chapters or modules unlocked through stretch goals.The Faerie Ring expands the fey options for both players and GMs using either Pathfinder Roleplaying Game or 5E and creates new opportunities for meddling where you probably shouldn't. It introduces new fey monsters, playable fey races and other character options, fey big bads or patrons (or both!), fey cities and planes and other locales, and more.This project aims to highlight the fey: to build their mythos with the strong personalities of powerful fey lords, to build their mystery with extraplanar fey locales and adventures, and to build their influence with fey character options.We're updating and remastering the two existing PDF releases (""Prelude"" and ""Red Jack"") and incorporating them along with nine additional chapters of brand new content as The Faerie Ring: Along the Twisting Way in two printed volumes: a Campaign Guide and a Player's Guide. Plus, a third book in PDF, the Magic Guide.The Faerie Ring began over 5 years ago and launched Zombie Sky Press. And though the project's been silent for a while, we've been quietly designing the whole time, and now, we're ready to unveil our plans. The original ""Prelude"" is linked in the Update section for everyone to check out. There's a plethora of amazing people designing and developing in our Fey Processing Plant, including Steven Helt (and the Horsemen), Monica Marlowe, Ben McFarland, Sarah Madsen, Mike Welham, Todd Stewart, Liz Courts, David Schwartz, John Bennett, Shawn Merwin, Dan Dillon, Chris Harris, Clinton Boomer, Wolfgang Baur, and Scott Gable. And visually, Julie Dillon, Carolina Eade, Domenico Neziti, and others are providing luscious fey creatures and landscapes. We'll be showcasing illustrations in our updates.The first seven chapters are nearly complete and are going through final edits and layout. And the last three chapters are being designed now. We'll unveil each chapter to backers as they're finished. The Faerie Ring gives you everything you need to play with fey characters and in fey locales. It's not a setting but, instead, a toolbox--a series of mini-settings!--to add more fey to your favorite settings. (Not unlike our previous It Came From The Stars: Campaign Guide did for space.)It contains 10 powerful fey lords and their servitors and demesnes. Each lord comes with an associated player race and extraplanar locales to add mystery, adventure, and whimsy to your campaign.  There are three separate books. The Campaign Guide contains our constantly expanding fey mythos, including the details of 10 fey lords (including their stats), more than 30 fey monsters, exotic extraplanar locales, and more. The Player's Guide contains at least 11 playable fey races and all the fey-themed character options (archetypes, feats, items, and more) to make them and other non-fey characters spring to life in any campaign. The Magic Guide contains the magic of the fey, detailing the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, incantations, the moonshadow, and more.The 10 fey lords:

Red Jack: A ghostly kitsune psychopath and avatar of death. He takes his love of death to a new level.

Hob: Silent and mysterious, eldest of the mogwoi lords. As different as they come. 

Jasmine: The Painted Lady. The Cannibal Queen. Driven by her hatred of Mab.

Manitou: Ancient trickster and horned god of the deep wood. Always looking to the horizon, wondering what’s on the other side. His own greatest foe.

Korapira: Mistress of the trees; terror in the leaves. Few can match her intensity and drive to get what she wants. She longs to bring her children—the entire plant kingdom—crashing down on the world.

Wild Hunt: The spirit of nature knows nothing of moderation. It cares nothing for mercy. It feels nothing for civilization. Its goal is survival, and for Slaine and the fir bolg, it is salvation. 

Mab: Queen Mab now speaks always of death, gloom, and the slow passing away of the fey worlds. She has become consumed by her regrets.

Moaro: A horrific and literal shadow of her former self, this darking is delusional and unpredictable, ever wandering.

Nemesis: Product of a tragic love story, she is now an uncaring engine of vengeance.

Flibbertigibbet: Clown prince of the mogwoi! Master of gremlins! Unintentional destroyer of worlds!
The 11 playable races:

Kitsune: Foxes. There's more to them than you think.

Matabiri: Aquatic and amoral scientists.

Black Hats & Far Darrig: Don't dare laugh at their magic hats.

Twilight Children (Changelings): Stolen and mixed-breed children. Always at the borders.

Putti: Psychic flower babies. Not as evil as their mother would like.

Fir Bolg: Nomadic dog warriors. Mortal enemies of the sidhe.  

Goodfellows: Winged sprites, hiding right behind you. 

Darklings: Militant crusaders from the plane of shadow.

Wyrd: Blind and prescient and not believing all your lies.

Bitterclaws: A more sophisticated brand of gremlin!
There will be two versions of The Faerie Ring: Along the Twisting Way. One for Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and one for 5E. The reward tiers are the same for both. You'll have a chance to choose your version during your backer survey after the campaign ends. If we exceed our funding? There are more fey lords awaiting their own spotlight. Maybe you can help us decide which to do next. Modo, the lord of murder, in his subterranean city of Agartha? Decade, mad psychic with dominion over time and space? Mahu, the lord of stealing, collecting all your stuff in Nowhere since the beginning of civilization? Wanamangura, the Rainbow Serpent, ever the dreamer? The mysterious Cicada? Obidicut, the lord of lust, in his city of Cockayne? Tane, fallen winged prince? Whiro, lord of the underworld? The dirty Mud Hermit? Rahab, the Chaosbringer? Or the terrible Morrigan and her sidhe city Tír na nÓg? (Who doesn't want to play as a sidhe!) Each unlocked lord will be developed as a new chapter, along with new player races and monsters and locations. And if we unlock 10 new ones, the second volume, Under a Poison Moon, will become available in print, as well. We also want to create modules, each with a fey-themed adventure and source material, such as the extraplanar deep-sea fey adventure Sea of Rahab by Todd Stewart (building from Hob's chapter in The Faerie Ring: Along the Twisting Way) and The Thousand Eyes by Richard Pett (building from Manitou's chapter).When a ""New Chapter"" is unlocked below, we'll create a new fey lord and their monsters (for the Campaign Guide), a new player race and options (for the Player's Guide), and additional magic (for the Magic Guide). Each fey lord will be determined by the backers: want Modo next, or maybe Decade, or someone else?",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span>You are the Boy. You wake up in a prison cell. As you get your bearings, you are suddenly released. Where are you?

stamina...</span></li>

You are the Boy. You wake up in a prison cell. As you get your bearings, you are suddenly released. Where are you? Who are you?  Explore dungeons, woods, mines and more to figure out (or indeed remember) the truth. The answers are out there, though they might not be what you expect.So what's the gameplay like? People like comparisons, so I'll give it a go: think of it as a top-down Zelda game, with the mouse-driven movement from Warcraft 3 and various MOBA titles,  mixed with a little bit of Diablo and The Binding of Isaac for good measure. And Bastion. Definitely some Bastion.
You can also find a post about the game's inspirations on my blog.
The main features of the game include:


Mouse-driven gameplay inspired by old-school RPGs and RTSs.

Randomly generated levels, each with more to explore than the previous one.
You get one life to tackle the challenge (a.k.a. permanent death).
Familiar combat with a twist: the more damage you take, the less damage you can inflict.
Alter 
the way you play: Make deals so magic orbs give you stamina instead, 
inflict and take double damage, or pay the price of magic with your 
stamina...
Piece 
together the lore throughout the game. You might not get all of it on 
the first run, but you’ll want to play again to get the whole 
story.
Voice-acted narration that doesn't interrupt gameplay
Good old secret areas that are... well, secret.
Oh yeah, and epic boss fights:













The combat is pretty cool. Here is what we think makes it so:

Stamina - Stamina Points (SP) are both the player's health and attack power: the more damage you take, the less damage you deal.
Magic - All magic spells are equal and cost 1 Magic Point (MP) to use. Choose which spell to use depending on the situation.
Deals - You can make deals to drastically change your playstyle: what if both you  and your enemies take double damage? How about using your Magic Points as a lifesource, but not being able to cast spells?






Here's what the money we make will be used for:

Rent (and maybe a little bit of food)
Voice talent
Testing devices

Exceeding our goal will also make our lives a lot easier and it would greatly helps us with things that we would otherwise pay from our own pocket, such as:


Web hosting
Software licenses
Marketing






You can try our public demo build of the game right now!
The game is currently in what we consider an alpha. Alphas, betas and other Greek alphabet don't really mean much these days, but to give you and idea of where we are at, our current estimate is to release the full game in fall 2015.

Of course, we will also post regular updates on development to keep you up to date.

Right now we have limited devices to test the game on, which is why we have this focus.The game is made with the Unity game engine, which offers platform options for Mac and Linux as well, so if we get funded, we'll be looking at those next. The current alpha build runs on both of those operating systems, so getting the final game to Mac and Linux in addition to Windows is very likely.System 
requirements are not set in stone at this point, but we will do our best to optimize
 the game to run on pretty much all modern computers and hopefully older
 ones as well.




From a gameplay standpoint, we want to make sure the game feels challenging but balanced. In a randomly generated environment, perfecting this will take time, but we believe we can do it.


This
 is our most ambitious project to date, so we expect to encounter some 
challenges in development, but with a fully-funded project we can face 
these head-on. Our commitment to this game has already produced fun and 
interesting results and we believe that once you get your hands on the game, you will agree.

If the goal is not met, will the game still be made?Yes. We are determined to make this game, funded or not. This is why we have chosen flexible funding.However, we won't be able to cover all development expenses on our own, which means that if we don't get funded, we will need to have regular jobs to pay the bills. Not being able to work on the game full time will significantly reduce effective development time, which pushes the release date back.
Which platforms will the game be available on?We're currently looking at Windows only for release. We are very interested in Mac and Linux as well, but we have too limited time and equipment to promise anything on that front. That said, both Mac and Linux versions are very likely to happen at some point. As for consoles, they are currently pretty much out of our reach. 


Can I influence the game's development/make suggestions?Absolutely! You can reach out on Twitter or comment on our Greenlight page. All feedback is greatly appreciated and taken into account.If you would like to be more directly involved, you can take a look at our Assistant Game Designer and Game Designer perks.
Controller support?The game has been developed from the start as  a PC game with mouse control, so... probably not. Sorry.


Will the game be on Steam?That is our hope, yes. You can help us get there by voting for us on Steam Greenlight.",40.0,2,"1 Campaign

It presents a Top Down Space Action Shooter with Customizable Collectable Card Game. 	It'll have many different modes such as: solo mission based mechanics and tournament mechanics. <br/> One of our goals are to introduce a monetary system that goes away from the pay to Win mechanic and more towards pay to enrich our client base. The goal is to have a system where people can make money by selling gold to other players. <br/>As the game becomes more demanding and popular, we have been estimated to make a large amount of income. Which is a mechanic has been tried and failed by many game companies. With our system, both the player and the company will be rewarded, and giving us the ability to hire more and grow our idea, bigger!

There will be will have a free to play web player client available by fall 2015 with commercials in the mission system.

</div></div>","Space Mode Tech DemoMany people have been asking where the game play video is. We have have working prototypes on display in the gallery however they do not express the full vision. We could show you guys pieces of technology however it is your backing that will help us achieve our goals. we are primarily an art team and programmers cost quite a lot. With your help, we can get this project in to a playable state.
If every person who has visited up to this point had contributed a single dollar to our campaign, we would already have a playable game to show. NanoCore is a Multi-Player Online 4X game. It presents a Top Down Space Action Shooter with Customizable Collectable Card Game. 	It'll have many different modes such as: solo mission based mechanics and tournament mechanics.  One of our goals are to introduce a monetary system that goes away from the pay to Win mechanic and more towards pay to enrich our client base. The goal is to have a system where people can make money by selling gold to other players. As the game becomes more demanding and popular, we have been estimated to make a large amount of income. Which is a mechanic has been tried and failed by many game companies. With our system, both the player and the company will be rewarded, and giving us the ability to hire more and grow our idea, bigger!

There will be will have a free to play web player client available by fall 2015 with commercials in the mission system. These commercials are all internal and are not associated with third party organizations.Purchasing a full version of the game will remove all commercials from the web player as well as unlocking downloadable client on all available platforms.Technology
all music and sound effects will be provided by:

Space ModeAs you build a ship you can venture into space. This is needed as you explore out to meet new users, discover players planets to unlock the ability to trade with those users, build friends and enemies and run in to hostile AI Aliens. The space mode is presented as a 3D top down faction action space shooter with thousands of ship combinations available. 

Solar Systems

Star Lanes
Orbital Structures
Newtonian Physics


City ModeAs you build and upgrade your city, assets that you are producing like ships and cards will produce faster.


Housing
Food Production
Factory
Refinery
Mines
Foundry
Ship Yard
Mission Control
Bank / vault
Space Port / Ship Yard

CCG Mode
NanoCore CCG mechanics are a supplemental feature in order to do artefact hunting in the game.  Combat in the missions is relative to the type of planet your city is on. Expedition missions are done by visiting someone's planet and delivering an expedition team. You can then access expeditions on that planet until the planet owner discovers the team.

Infantry Cards
Mechanized Ground Cards
Mechanized Air Cards
Instant Cards
NanoCore Cards




Providing we reach our goal, we can achieve alpha access in roughly 3 months. A large majority of the artwork for this stage, is already complete. We have primarily been an art team from the beginning. Programming hasn't been an easy hurdle, as we only have 1 programmer experienced in this. The project is overwhelming for one person, and thus hiring additional help would relieve much of the strain. We would like for this project to eventually make it the point, that it can sustain a team of developers, full time. With stretch goals, the dream and finished game, can become more of a reality to everyone.


    


With your help, this campaign will allow us to bring this game to life. It will give us the resources needed to hire out-sourcing, in order to get our product live. The contributions will also allow us to pay existing outsourcing bills that we have already accumulated. We have a strong art team, however we need to reinforce the 3d section of our team. This includes, but is not limited to texture and 3d asset creation. We need to hire specialty Programmers, with experience in Unity3d. On my income, I don't make enough to subsidize an individuals income. Everything up til now has been done under volunteered time. Below is a projection chart, of our estimate to the initial goal of $20,000, and how we would distribute funds.



We understand this game is flex funded however this game will be getting completed, even if no one contrinutes. However this would cause development take take conciderably longer then we are all hoping so if you have read this all and like our game idea, be sure to get yourself a perk on the right and make this game happen faster.

<p> Seven years ago while in Beijng I had a freak accident. With no warning, I tumbled down a construction shaft and fractured my spine. My sole memory of the accident was the free falling plummet I had before hitting my head on the side. I woke  to find myself at the bottom of a construction shaft with a sore head, tight chest and the broken pieces of a wooden plank which I had crashed through during my plummet. If that plank hadn’t been there, I believe I would be a lot worse off then. I was there for an hour before firemen were called in to pull me out of this enclosed space. It was easily the most terrifying experience of my life and has caused me considerable consistent pain for the last seven years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2014, I was free-falling again – I had been made redundant. Suddenly I had lots of spare time. I decided to create something special to mark the anniversary of my accident in Beijing. What I created was Plummet Free Fall,  a endless falling game where you guide a game version of me. The designer captured me well (however I didn't believe I was that ginger).</p>

<p><strong>When we first decided to create a crowdfunding campaign, we knew that we needed to have something playable for you all to experience. We felt that an idea alone was simply not enough to secure your hard-earned funds, and more importantly, your trust.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sorrowvirus</strong> is just one of the <strong>short single-player stories</strong> that will be featured within Faceless. The Sorrowvirus explores Wyatt Heyll's penultimate visit to Purgatory as he fights to end his suffering at the hands of his parents once and for all. The Sorrowvirus allows the player to explore a twisted amalgamation of abandoned areas from Wakeland City as Wyatt is overwhelmed by guilt for ignoring the Dolls of Wakeland City. As you venture through The Sorrowvirus again after completing it in search of the True Ending, the threat level will increase and you will struggle even further to keep track of time in a timeless place. Be on the lookout for a secret within The Sorrowvirus to be eligible for a secret, limited and discounted backer perk here on IndieGoGo!</p>

<p>Many of you may know Faceless as the <i>Slender-Man</i> game that was being developed on the Source Engine from 2013-2014. After receiving a <i>Cease &amp; Desist</i> from the Slender-Man's option holders, we rebooted the project with a new and improved monster, as well as a new and improved story. It was originally designed to be a multi-player remake of The Eight Pages. But it now focuses around its multi-player gamemode, <strong>Dolls of Wakeland.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531406735/tihcccfgdfn8fnmfwnor.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Dolls of Wakeland</strong> is our main multiplayer (and singleplayer) gamemode that allows for up to four players to explore eight possible locations in Wakeland City that are known to have Ritual Zones located within them. Ritual Zones allow for any Dolls you find to have the souls trapped within them set free. Setting all of the souls free from each location brings you closer from freeing Wakeland City from its nauseating effects, which is the sole reason why no life wanders there.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551378302/e2mrfj5jtpj2uoqhkgo2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, the game's wounded antagonist, <strong>the Soulrender</strong>, is lurking around the corner. With souls as its only food source, it won't let you go easily. Encountering the Soulrender will cause you to either pass out from overwhelming nausea if you stay too close for it for too long or be knocked out from a violent hit. The Soulrender will never kill you, allowing your friends to revive you when they are able to. <i>The Soulrender's appearance is currently being kept a secret, and will be revealed at a later date!</i></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531414162/w7sqpdrzbwytmf0irylm.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The secondary antagonists are <strong>Anomalies</strong>, charred and firey figures seen in the trailer and screenshots above. These dormant threats will appear around the map when you and your friends begin collecting and freeing souls. <i>This particular kind of Anomaly</i> has skin that is lethal to the touch, so be careful when sprinting around corners, because you never know where they'll appear.</p>
<p>The Dolls have at least two-hundred potential spawn points in each map, meaning that in every game, it is exceptionally rare, if not nearly impossible that there will ever be the same pattern of Dolls twice.</p>

<p>Aside from <strong>The Sorrowvirus</strong>, <i>which is available now,</i> Faceless will also have additional Short Stories, some which will explore different genres of gameplay, including a sidescroller horror and a PSX-era prequel story.</p>

<p><strong>Whispers of Wakeland</strong> is a single player Prologue to Faceless, which follows Elijah Grey <strong>(Sam A. Mowry </strong><i>(Amnesia: The Dark Descent)</i><strong>)</strong> as he makes his way towards the Fallen Grace Church in order to search for Daniel North. He must find out if the Sorrowvirus was successful in destroying the Soulrender and survive the Anomalies that gather at the Asylum underneath the church. When signs begin to appear that something inexplicable happened here, Elijah must work his way carefully around the Anomalies that lurk through the Asylum and try to escape.</p>

<p><strong>The Perishing of Daniel North</strong> is a single player Epilogue to Faceless, as you take control of the signature character of Faceless; Daniel North. You must guide Daniel through Purgatory as he remembers the pivotal moments that occurred before his downfall and find your way out from the ever-changing, timeless place. Anomalies return in <strong>TPoDN</strong> as Daniel roams through a warped version of his childhood home, and other important places in his life.</p>

<p>As is always the case, based on the reception and success of the game, we'd love nothing more than to add further content to it, such as <strong>an additional multi-player </strong><strong>gamemode</strong> and some <strong>new maps</strong>. Right now, however, Faceless will come with one multiplayer gamemode and eight maps. (Four small, four large based on the intended length of gameplay players would like.) Our current plans are to launch the game with one multiplayer gamemode and four maps, and release the remaining four maps throughout the first year of release.</p>
<p>The other multiplayer gamemode that we would like to make would be Doll Hunt, a gamemode that can be played in any of the existing maps where up to 8 people are split into two teams. Dolls, and Hunters. The Dolls are given a set amount of time to find a space to hide from the Hunters, while the Hunters must find the Dolls and deliver them to the Ritual Zones.</p>

When we first decided to create a crowdfunding campaign, we knew that we needed to have something playable for you all to experience. We felt that an idea alone was simply not enough to secure your hard-earned funds, and more importantly, your trust.
The Sorrowvirus is just one of the short single-player stories that will be featured within Faceless. The Sorrowvirus explores Wyatt Heyll's penultimate visit to Purgatory as he fights to end his suffering at the hands of his parents once and for all. The Sorrowvirus allows the player to explore a twisted amalgamation of abandoned areas from Wakeland City as Wyatt is overwhelmed by guilt for ignoring the Dolls of Wakeland City. As you venture through The Sorrowvirus again after completing it in search of the True Ending, the threat level will increase and you will struggle even further to keep track of time in a timeless place. Be on the lookout for a secret within The Sorrowvirus to be eligible for a secret, limited and discounted backer perk here on IndieGoGo!


Many of you may know Faceless as the Slender-Man game that was being developed on the Source Engine from 2013-2014. After receiving a Cease & Desist from the Slender-Man's option holders, we rebooted the project with a new and improved monster, as well as a new and improved story. It was originally designed to be a multi-player remake of The Eight Pages. But it now focuses around its multi-player gamemode, Dolls of Wakeland.

Dolls of Wakeland is our main multiplayer (and singleplayer) gamemode that allows for up to four players to explore eight possible locations in Wakeland City that are known to have Ritual Zones located within them. Ritual Zones allow for any Dolls you find to have the souls trapped within them set free. Setting all of the souls free from each location brings you closer from freeing Wakeland City from its nauseating effects, which is the sole reason why no life wanders there.

However, the game's wounded antagonist, the Soulrender, is lurking around the corner. With souls as its only food source, it won't let you go easily. Encountering the Soulrender will cause you to either pass out from overwhelming nausea if you stay too close for it for too long or be knocked out from a violent hit. The Soulrender will never kill you, allowing your friends to revive you when they are able to. The Soulrender's appearance is currently being kept a secret, and will be revealed at a later date!

The secondary antagonists are Anomalies, charred and firey figures seen in the trailer and screenshots above. These dormant threats will appear around the map when you and your friends begin collecting and freeing souls. This particular kind of Anomaly has skin that is lethal to the touch, so be careful when sprinting around corners, because you never know where they'll appear.
The Dolls have at least two-hundred potential spawn points in each map, meaning that in every game, it is exceptionally rare, if not nearly impossible that there will ever be the same pattern of Dolls twice.

Aside from The Sorrowvirus, which is available now, Faceless will also have additional Short Stories, some which will explore different genres of gameplay, including a sidescroller horror and a PSX-era prequel story.


Whispers of Wakeland is a single player Prologue to Faceless, which follows Elijah Grey (Sam A. Mowry (Amnesia: The Dark Descent)) as he makes his way towards the Fallen Grace Church in order to search for Daniel North. He must find out if the Sorrowvirus was successful in destroying the Soulrender and survive the Anomalies that gather at the Asylum underneath the church. When signs begin to appear that something inexplicable happened here, Elijah must work his way carefully around the Anomalies that lurk through the Asylum and try to escape.


The Perishing of Daniel North is a single player Epilogue to Faceless, as you take control of the signature character of Faceless; Daniel North. You must guide Daniel through Purgatory as he remembers the pivotal moments that occurred before his downfall and find your way out from the ever-changing, timeless place. Anomalies return in TPoDN as Daniel roams through a warped version of his childhood home, and other important places in his life.

Watchmaker consists of six members, not including the incredible voice talent and volunteers who have helped along the way.
Adam Sklar, Project Lead, Level Designer and Writer: I'm Adam Sklar, and I'm the Project Lead for Faceless.  I joined the team back when it was another game entirely, and I'm exceptionally proud of everybody who has contributed their incredible skills towards this Short Story. We look forward to bringing more of Faceless to you!
Ángel C. Rodríguez, 3D Artist & Texture Designer: My name is Angel. I'm a Spanish 3D modeller currently based in Gijon.

instructions and others simply cannot grasp the concept, no matter how basic it
might seem to an adult. It's easy for a barrier to build up between a
frustrated child and their parent or teacher. Learning is a challenge!</p>
<p>To remove this barrier, we are designing, developing,
and publishing a set of applications for all kids - no matter their needs. Our
apps will be available on iOS, Android and Kindle, based around game-like
learning, to give children an entertaining way to learn. It will feature more
than four hundred universal good manners, including proper etiquette and
routine tasks, problem-solving, and decision-making via moral-based stories and
activities. Each will be broken down into an easy to understand, productive
exercise.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p>

</p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p>Every child has the right to learn new things, to feel
included and to participate in social activities.  This is harder for some
kids than others, but it doesn't mean a space should be left between them.
Children deserve to have equal footing in this world, a start that's
dependable and productive, especially for those who need extra
encouragement. </p>
<p>We are focusing on the concepts of sharing,
playing well with other children, being productive in school, and
taking care of health. Each lesson will lead into an interactive moral-based
story, followed by kid-friendly, productive exercises that will help the lesson
be happily remembered and easily applied.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432391018/asqjehtvvog5mkffncpr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>These apps could be used as a tool at school and at
home, beginning at an early stage.</p>
<p>Children will have the chance to build up independence,
confidence, and ease of making friends and setting goals and keeping both. The
role-play moral-based stories and related multi-sensory activities
will help motivate them to use the lessons learned in their physical
lives.</p>
<p>With our apps, children learn in a fun and rewarding
way, which reduces pressure and lessens frustrations that traditional teaching
methods tend to promote. An example of taking care of one's self: most
children, when asked to explain how to brush their teeth, will simply say to
put toothpaste on the toothbrush and then brush the teeth. Our app provides a
clearer explanation and demonstration for your child - running through the
motions of selecting the proper toothbrush, wetting it, placing only a small
amount of toothpaste on it, adjusting the angle of the brush with the gums, how
to brush properly, rinse the mouth, rinse the brush, and rinse the sink. Mom
will love that last part.</p>
<p>We are breaking down these tasks into simple steps, so
that they are easier to understand and remember.</p>
<p>The lessons that these amazing and interactive apps will
include, for example:</p>
<p>• 
Wash hands</p>
<p>• 
Brush teeth</p>
<p>• 
Sharing is caring</p>
<p>• 
Meeting and greeting</p><p></p><p></p>

animation. Users are encouraged to practice a task until mastered and offered
positive feedback when a task is done correctly. Audio reinforcements, such as
clapping, help keep the user motivated. </p>
<p>Children can play with the screens by tapping different
parts of it. For example - a lesson on sharing, may be accompanied by a drag
and drop screen, to give the user a chance to share their virtual object.</p>
<p><b>This
tool isn't just for school but for the home as well. Kids enjoy playing these
apps on smartphones or tablets</b>–so whether they’re home or
traveling on a bus, plane or train, they’ll be able to play and learn. The
travel time will just fly by!</p>
<p>Never before has a learning series like this been
launched on mobile devices or tablets. It's a fresh and entertaining way to
teach children social skills, fine motor skills, visual perception, visual
scanning, and other skills that lead to a happier, more successful life.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FsuCBvAdjrxs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsuCBvAdjrxs&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FsuCBvAdjrxs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

How are these apps are going to aid in the education of children?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Our
team has been carefully selected from across the world and from extremely
relative industries. Though we come from varied lives, we all share the same
dream of creating a better and brighter future for children. Each member of
this team was selected for the expertise that they have in their chosen

<p>From the start of the design process to the day that
these apps are published, your children are the only priority. The entire team

When will you start designing and developing this series?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>As

<p><b>Q:
How do I follow the progress of the project?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Our

send out. We will also add a Progress Section to our website, which every
backer will have access to. Backers will be able to see what the team has
already completed, what we are currently working on, and what will be started
next. Updates will be frequently posted on our social media pages as well.</p>
<p><b>Q:
When will I receive my perks?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>There

<p>Soft copies will be sent within the first month. Over

instructions and others simply cannot grasp the concept, no matter how basic it
might seem to an adult. It's easy for a barrier to build up between a
frustrated child and their parent or teacher. Learning is a challenge!
To remove this barrier, we are designing, developing,
and publishing a set of applications for all kids - no matter their needs. Our
apps will be available on iOS, Android and Kindle, based around game-like
learning, to give children an entertaining way to learn. It will feature more
than four hundred universal good manners, including proper etiquette and
routine tasks, problem-solving, and decision-making via moral-based stories and
activities. Each will be broken down into an easy to understand, productive
exercise.



Every child has the right to learn new things, to feel
included and to participate in social activities.  This is harder for some
kids than others, but it doesn't mean a space should be left between them.
Children deserve to have equal footing in this world, a start that's
dependable and productive, especially for those who need extra
encouragement. 
We are focusing on the concepts of sharing,
playing well with other children, being productive in school, and
taking care of health. Each lesson will lead into an interactive moral-based
story, followed by kid-friendly, productive exercises that will help the lesson
be happily remembered and easily applied.These apps could be used as a tool at school and at
home, beginning at an early stage.
Children will have the chance to build up independence,
confidence, and ease of making friends and setting goals and keeping both. The
role-play moral-based stories and related multi-sensory activities
will help motivate them to use the lessons learned in their physical
lives.
With our apps, children learn in a fun and rewarding
way, which reduces pressure and lessens frustrations that traditional teaching
methods tend to promote. An example of taking care of one's self: most
children, when asked to explain how to brush their teeth, will simply say to
put toothpaste on the toothbrush and then brush the teeth. Our app provides a
clearer explanation and demonstration for your child - running through the
motions of selecting the proper toothbrush, wetting it, placing only a small
amount of toothpaste on it, adjusting the angle of the brush with the gums, how
to brush properly, rinse the mouth, rinse the brush, and rinse the sink. Mom
will love that last part.
We are breaking down these tasks into simple steps, so
that they are easier to understand and remember.
The lessons that these amazing and interactive apps will
include, for example:
• 
Wash hands
• 
Brush teeth
• 
Sharing is caring
• 
Meeting and greeting

These apps are fully interactive, complete with
animation. Users are encouraged to practice a task until mastered and offered
positive feedback when a task is done correctly. Audio reinforcements, such as
clapping, help keep the user motivated. 
Children can play with the screens by tapping different
parts of it. For example - a lesson on sharing, may be accompanied by a drag
and drop screen, to give the user a chance to share their virtual object.
This
tool isn't just for school but for the home as well. Kids enjoy playing these
apps on smartphones or tablets–so whether they’re home or
traveling on a bus, plane or train, they’ll be able to play and learn. The
travel time will just fly by!
Never before has a learning series like this been
launched on mobile devices or tablets. It's a fresh and entertaining way to
teach children social skills, fine motor skills, visual perception, visual
scanning, and other skills that lead to a happier, more successful life.

Give your children the start they deserve.


Children’s use of parents’ mobile devices and tablets at
home is a common “every day” occurrence. The bright colors and entertaining
sound effects featured in mobile apps are like magnets, drawing children in and
holding their attention tightly. 
There's no child that would turn down the chance to play
with a tablet. There are, however, concerns from the parents: what if this app
isn't really child-friendly? Are they just wasting their time? Couldn't they be
doing something more productive, something more engaging?
Our apps eliminate those concerns: we have your children
in mind, from start to finish. We want to entertain and educate children
everywhere in a fun and creative way. Your child will soon be lost in the
colorful background and role-play style of moral-based stories. They won't even
realize that they're learning!
Your worries will be gone...and your children will get a
strong boost in learning.




We have worked passionately for three years on
""Helping Children Learn."" We are an eclectic group from the East and
West who share the same goal. 
We realize that children in every nation need a strong
start in life - that's something that we can all agree on. We, as adults, are
responsible for providing that start. 
Our team is composed of experts from graphic designers
to developers, educational professionals to medical professionals! We use our
joint knowledge to create the content for the apps and ensure that the
education provided is top-notch.Mirza Zaim Baig began his professional career in the technology industry in 2000. By 2003, he was able to obtain a Masters’ degree in Information Technology. Software Development is his passion, and it’s also what he has been involved in for the past fifteen years, including analysis, technical sales, software development, and management positions.Suzanne Bowen taught English to children ages 10 - 13 for eleven years, co-founded a 1999 dot-com Super Technologies, Inc., and runs a copy editing business. She has traveled throughout Pakistan, Germany, Mexico, the Middle East, UK and North America, was once homeless, and is an avid marathon runner. Collins Lai all kinds of beautiful things! Appreciate graphics, illustration, architectures, etc., but prefers to specialize in digital, magazine, editorial and illustration. 




Development of quality graphics isn't cheap. It isn't
something that can be done quickly, either. We are in some of the final stages
of production for the series of mobile apps. Test runs are in process now to
ensure that everything runs smoothly and most, if not all, of the content has
already been written. 
After three years of hard work, all of our available
resources have become sparse. The goal of our product is to offer a helping
hand to children. Now, we need your helping hands to keep going.
The goal is to raise enough funds to turn the series of
apps into a reality. Financial support is needed to kick-start this program.
Everyone who backs this product will be able to see the progress of the design

About the project ownerMy name is Thomas ZIGHEM, I'm 44 years old and I've had a passion for programming and video games since I was only 15. Back then, having a computer at home was unusual, and we didn't really know what we could do with it.During my career as a developer, I have held various positions such as game designer, programmer, graphic designer, animator and Technical Director, where I could express my attention to detail and my creativity.For more than two years now, Evelyne and I have been working on ""Genesia Legacy"", which is scheduled to be released for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux in 2015, and later for iOS and Android tablets.Honey, we're on TV!In october 2014, when Twitch launched the Game Development category, I jumped at the opportunity to be a pioneer and to share my work and my experience during ""live streams"". There I can answer your questions live and show you the progression of the development of ""Genesia Legacy"".Sir Thomas on TwitchWhy a crowdfunding campaign?Since 21 january 2013, the development of Genesia Legacy has been solely financed by our own savings.

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">App development: we are almost done with an iOS version, but we need help testing it, making adjustments, adding a secure pay system, and creating an Android version.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Marketing: we plan to market through social media campaigns, email, and print materials at strategic locations.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Employees: we need good help! We'd like to be able to hire energetic workers to print photos, screen photos, market our product, develop new ideas, and provide high-quality customer service as soon as possible.</span><br/>

<p>GrandShare is a labor of love that responds to an important need in our society. What started out as personal--an ability to share paper photos of my niece with older family members--has become much more. We have met people everywhere who know someone who wants a paper photo, but they feel like they don't have the time or means to print it and send it. </p>
<p>This is not just about us, but about making a large number of people happy, too.</p>
<p>It makes sense that so many people prefer paper--there's something so <i>fleeting </i>about a digital photo. Here's what's special about GrandShare photo cards:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They last.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They can't be accidentally deleted.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They don't require a password.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They don't require battery power.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They don't require internet access.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They don't become obsolete when the next version comes out.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464746158/GS_envelope_dgvasf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 146.559px;height: 166px;""/></p></div>
<p>People who want paper are right to prefer its durability and usefulness. </p>
<p>People with smartphones who want to print pictures with ease will love this service, and there is a large population of people who will love the paper gifts they receive. These customers include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">people who like simply receiving a card in the mail.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">people who are home-bound.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">people who can't afford smart phones or who don't want to use them.</span><br/>

</li>

App development: we are almost done with an iOS version, but we need help testing it, making adjustments, adding a secure pay system, and creating an Android version.


Marketing: we plan to market through social media campaigns, email, and print materials at strategic locations.


Employees: we need good help! We'd like to be able to hire energetic workers to print photos, screen photos, market our product, develop new ideas, and provide high-quality customer service as soon as possible.


Materials and office space: we've invested our own money in materials, but we will need more supplies and space as we expand.


Any amount of money will help us reach our goal. GrandShare is currently a company with five part-time employees. We will expand intelligently based on resources. 
With more contributions, we can offer more services to more people at a faster rate, including more frequently sent photo cards and international service. 
Any amount helps, though, as we have the materials and person-power to operate on a small scale currently.
We appreciate you! We are so grateful for your help! Any amount will do a lot to get us off the ground. We offer backers everything from personalized coupon codes to trips to Philadelphia based on your contribution. Check out our perks!   The Impact

GrandShare is a labor of love that responds to an important need in our society. What started out as personal--an ability to share paper photos of my niece with older family members--has become much more. We have met people everywhere who know someone who wants a paper photo, but they feel like they don't have the time or means to print it and send it. 
This is not just about us, but about making a large number of people happy, too.
It makes sense that so many people prefer paper--there's something so fleeting about a digital photo. Here's what's special about GrandShare photo cards:



They last.


They can't be accidentally deleted.


They don't require a password.


They don't require battery power.


They don't require internet access.


They don't become obsolete when the next version comes out.



People who want paper are right to prefer its durability and usefulness. 
People with smartphones who want to print pictures with ease will love this service, and there is a large population of people who will love the paper gifts they receive. These customers include:



people who like simply receiving a card in the mail.


people who are home-bound.


people who can't afford smart phones or who don't want to use them.


people who are incarcerated.


people with limited internet access.


There are a lot of folks who want to share and a lot of folks who want to receive! All of these are great reasons to choose GrandShare!

What's More

GrandShare is a company in good hands. The co-founders have decades of experience in finance, marketing, IT, and education. We care about people and about ways to make them happy. Our IT director has also run two other successful businesses. Our marketing specialists are professional writers and consultants. In addition to my experience working in finance, I've owned companies and am a certified Harley Davidson mechanic. I make things work. GrandShare is comprised of a team of dedicated and talented people committed to our work. Check out our story in The Philly Voice!

Beginning small with sectional product distribution
Initial domestic service
Applying for patents

Establishing partnerships with local and national businesses

Finding and hiring highly talented independent contractors

Ensuring the appropriateness of all images sent
Developing new options as we expand
Using environmentally friendly materials

Even if not all the goals are met, 3:00am Dead Time will be delivered.   Every funder will be included in the game's credits, and if the goal is surpassed, we have plans to make additions and upgrades for all the perks. Irreverent Software  is a small game development team of 4 members.

Jorge Pinal N. - Programmer / Writer / Game Designer / 3D & 2D artist. He is the level/game designer, programmer and one of the two 3D artists in Irreverent Software. He is also the main writer and designer behind 3:00am Dead Time. With extensive coding experience both inside and outside game development, almost every line of code behind our games is made from scratch by him.

Daniel Pinal N. - 3D Animator / 2D artist / Traditional 2D art. With several years of experience in both digital and traditional art as well as extensive work as freelancer, he is the one who makes all the concept art, sketches, base designs, drawings and wallpapers for the game, as well as most of the 3D animations. 

Manuel Pinal G. - 3D artist / 2D artist. He is the second 3D artist in Irreverent Software, and the one in charge of most of the high-quality character sculpting, rigging and retopology. WIth more than 20 years of experience in 3D and 2D design including extensive experience with CAD tools, he has contributed with many high fidelity artwork pieces.

Lydia Negrete T. - Creative Assistance / Financial Assistance / Quality testing. She gives the team financial, creative and story supervision with her experience in Language and Accountancy, as well as extensive bug tracking and quality test work.
 And giving his help to this project to give it its very own and distinct Original Soundtrack,  the very talented Konstantin Shmyrev is the composer behind every track in 3:00am Dead Time. As a team, we aim to achieve the highest quality in our work and provide the best experience to all the gamers. So far, thousands of hours have been put into the development of 3:00am Dead Time to make sure that both the playable demo and the full game reach the expectatives that we have planned for it.This game is our dream project, an idea we have been working on even years before the first line of code was written, polishing the stories and all the features we wanted to include, putting all of our time and savings on pushing it this far.  Your help is very needed and will be extremely appreciated, to make 3:00am Dead Time a reality, and make it reach its full potential as a highly memorable and unique horror experience.In the space below we have put a simple FAQ, but if you have any question or want to give any feedback to our team, you can easily reach us here in the comments,  at irrsoft@zoho.com, IndieDB or through Twitter , where we post daily updates on the game. Thanks for reading, and for all your support!The Irreverent Software Team  Q : Will the game be DRM-Free?A : A DRM-Free version of the game is planned to be released along with the final Steam version of the game.Q : Will the requirements change during development?A : The requirements for the game are not definitive at this point of the development. However, they won't be much different from the ones used for the demo. To know if your PC can handle the game, we recommend you to download and try the demo version.Q : Will 3:00am Dead Time be released for other platforms or VR?A : Initial release of the game is planned for Windows and Linux. If there are chances to port the game to more platforms (including consoles and VR) we will make the corresponding update and share the news here.Q : How long is the full game? How many levels does it have?A : Right now we have six episodes (each one with multiple levels) planned for the full game, with heavy work in the first two episodes already going on. Additional levels might be added depending on if we reach the stretch goals of this funding campaign. Taking into account the pre-Alpha length of a normal episode, the full game will be between 8 and 14 hours long for one branch of each mission's story and only in single player. The game has high replayability value. The demo we released represents less than 20 percent of the length of a normal Episode.Q : Will the game be available in X language (voice and texts)?A : So far a release in both English and Spanish is planned, with additional languages depending on the success of the funding campaign. Q : Will the game be available on different stores?A : The game has already been approved on Steam Greenlight, so a Steam release is planned and in the works. There is also planned release (including Early Access) for GameJolt. A release on GOG is also planned, but it will depend on their approval process. If you have any suggestions for more stores where you would like to see the game, contact us and we will research the possibility to send the game for approval there too.",22.0,1,"1 Campaign

Hello! 
Thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign page, let's get started!







Soulless is an atmospheric 2D puzzle platformer set in a world of silhouettes. 
You play as a cute creature called Elin whose main goal is to save his friend, but to do that he has to jump down the rabbit hole into a magical world which is unknown to him.
He is guided through the world by a light, that shines with hope, however the further he goes, he realizes the world only gets darker and darker and that he has to face his deepest fears.

Fight your fears in boss battles, solve the world’s many puzzles, by combining many different mechanics and learn the truth of the world you are in.






On the surface, it looks like a classical story of saving your friend, but if you scratch a bit deeper, it becomes more complex, and more personal.              
The mechanics of the game are never a constant variable, they will always change and combine from level to level.    





Among other things, yes.
The story is meant to be at the same time straightforward and abstract. Your goal is simple, save you friend. Who is that friend? Who are you? Why are you here? That's all up to you to figure it out, and we are sure everyone is going to have an idea of their own.
We did this so you can be the writer of your own story.















Elin is the main character in this game. What is he? That's for you to decide.


Elin doesn't have superpowers, he can't run at the speed of light, he can't lift a truck. He is fueled by his emotions, and that's what gives him power.
Throughout the game, he uses his intelligence to manipulate objects around him and use them to his advantage, be it small rocks or strange contraptions left behind that manipulate gravity!
He has a guide, a light that pulled him into this world. It guides Elin throughout the game and gives him hope in the darkest of hours.

Oh, also... Sometimes he can fly.
