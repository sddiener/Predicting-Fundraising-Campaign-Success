<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For me, ""Warm Women"" is a culmination of many years of making solo and group choreography and performance art, and an intersection with the work I do teaching yoga and leading women's workshops that focus on female healing and empowerment through connecting to our bodies and sensuality. I am so proud of this creation and cannot wait to share its riches and watch it grow! </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After premiering ""Warm Women"" at Bushwick Open Studios (a Brooklyn based arts festival) last Spring, to a very enthusiastic response, we began to discuss its future, and how we could most efficiently and expansively share the work and its message.

<p>We believe that as human beings raised in a patriarchal, sexually repressive culture, there is a tremendous amount of unlearning required in order to actually connect, in a shame-free way, with our own bodies, needs, and desires. This applies to all genders and orientations, as we have all received a mountain of messages from the media, our families, our hometowns, and our lineages regarding what it means to be sexy, sexual, desirable, healthy, and ""normal"". Because of this, we must carefully identify and remove the hooks and blocks that keep us from knowing and celebrating ourselves and each other. </p>
<p>Warm Women serves as a window into the female sexual experience, in no way covering the myriad bases, but representing potent moments along the spectrum. Our goal is to help people feel connected, supported, comforted, and encouraged to listen to and honor themselves, their bodies, and each other, and to remember that “sexy” is not an image, a product, or idea that can be bought or sold, but rather, something that comes from listening to and following our own sensations and needs. Sexy is what feels good.</p>
<br/>There is so much shame in our culture, which becomes both internalized and externalized collectively and individually.

<br/>Who’s on the team and how did this all get
started?<br/>
</h2>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>
The beginning…</h3>
<span>
Last year, in London, our Director, Walter Bayer, attended a talk at the Royal
British Society of Sculptors on public art. Utterly inspired by what he’d
heard, it was here that he met artist Alexandra Harley, MRBS, who asked him
that fateful question, “Have you ever thought of organizing a sculpture
symposium in Anguilla?” <br/>
<br/>
</span><h3><span>A little history…</span></h3>
<span>
From Alex, Walter learned that sculpture symposia take place all over the
world, from Russia to Australia to Germany. The International Sculpture
Symposium movement originated in Austria in 1959 when sculptor Karl Prantl created an event in an
abandoned stone quarry in a bid to provide networking opportunities for artists
working in 3D. From then on sculptors have been helping each
other to initiate new symposia worldwide. For each symposium, artists come
together to work on their own pieces, to share their skills and knowledge with
each other in an environment of support and cooperation, and to create works
for the community to enjoy for generations.<br/></span><br/>

</span><h3><span><b><br/>Introducing the team…</b></span></h3>
<span>
The more Walter thought about it, the more he liked the idea and all the
exciting educational and artistic possibilities it entailed for the island. The
Symposium soon became a family project as Walter enlisted the help of his two
daughters, Helen and Teresa, and his good friends, Penny and Hendrick. Together
this mad cap team have recruited a trusted team of advisors and experts,
including Anguillian artists Courtney Devonish and Cheddie Richardson; Joan
Richardson, Anguilla Tourist Board; and Janine Edwards, marketing expert and

</b><br/></div>","What is the First Anguilla Sculpture
Symposium?
The first event of its kind in the Caribbean, the First Anguilla Sculpture
Symposium is a dynamic, LIVE public event in which, over a 3-week period, 3
internationally renowned artists will create 3 original sculptures celebrating
Anguilla’s history and culture. 

When & Where?
The Symposium will take place at the beautiful Art Café in historic Island Harbour, Anguilla, from November
9 through November 27, 2015. 
What are we all about and what impact will this event have?For us, it’s all about creating a legacy of
art and education for the beloved place we call home—Anguilla.



Free and open to the public, the
Symposium is a unique opportunity for residents and visitors alike to watch the
artists hard at work, to speak with them, and to learn first hand about what
actually goes into the creation of a public sculpture. Locals, tourists, Anguillian
youth, and the sculptors will together experience the joy that comes from
liberating a work of art from a block of stone or a hunk of metal.


To
engage and ignite the latent creativity of the Island’s youth, school groups will come from all over the island to visit the worksite.  While
there, the participating artists will lead a series of innovative sculpture
workshops for the students—sharing their skills, knowledge and love of the art
form.


To offer those students with the nascent skills and maturity,
especially at risk youth, the opportunity to uncover their talents, there is
the possibility of hands-on participation in the creative work.

The public sculptures that the
artists create will remain on permanent display on Anguilla, and it’s our hope
that they will constitute the first steps in what will in time become Anguilla’s
Sculpture Trail.

As an international event, the
Symposium fosters cultural exchange and cooperation between the participating artists, who are joining us
from various parts of the globe, and Anguilla’s thriving arts and crafts
community.

I’ve had tics caused by Tourette Syndrome since I was young. The tics are cyclical, and can get really severe and debilitating, especially when I feel anxious. To me, anxiety feels like there’s all kinds of pressure built up inside of me, and the tics are my body’s way of releasing the pressure. I have discovered that while I’m drawing, my tics subside. It’s as if the pressure is being released through my pen instead of my face, and it’s such a relief. For this reason I am constantly sketching, and have filled over 1,000 sketchbook pages in the last 12 months alone. </p><p>“Remedial Sketches” is a book that is very personal because of how important sketching has become to me. I’ve spent the past few months compiling and organizing work from my sketchbooks to find my favorite pages. Because all of the drawings have meaning to me for one reason or another, it has been hard narrowing them down to what will be included in the book. </p><p>I currently have a few different versions of the book ranging from 144 - 192 pages, and ultimately one of them will be the final product.

Because the book will be 100% complete while the campaign is still running, it will be sent to the printers the second this campaign wraps up, and the printer has agreed to print and rush-ship books for those who pre-order through this campaign. This means that by supporting the campaign you are guaranteeing that you will receive your books up to 8 weeks sooner than anyone else. By contributing to the campaign you are also helping me to publish this meaningful book, and I am very grateful to you for helping me make this a reality.

All of the funds raised through this campaign will go directly towards the cost of printing this 144+ page full color art book. The more copies I am able to order, the cheaper each individual book will cost. At 1,000 copies the per book cost goes down dramatically, which helps me keep the price of each individual book as low as possible.</p><p>As far as crowdfunding goes, this project is virtually risk-free for you, the backer, and here’s why: Although reaching my goal will help me print 1,000 copies of “Remedial Sketches”, I will print the number of copies I need to fulfill orders even if I don’t fully reach the goal. This means that if you help me fund this campaign, you can be confident that you will receive your perk even if the campaign is not fully funded. But please keep in mind that reaching the goal would be huge for this project, and whatever you can give to help will absolutely make a difference and will be greatly appreciated. </p><p>This is also my second campaign. My first campaign was another successful book, and all of my backers received their perks in a timely fashion.

We're excited to bring great new experiences such as a mobile foundry offering participants the opportunity create their own iron artwork, a Circus Club performing and teaching aerial stunts, Missoula's best musicians of every genre, nationally acclaimed comedians, and much more.At Arts Missoula we have always focused on paying our First Night artists, for without them there would be no celebration.  In addition, there are the costs of technical assistance, venue rental, insurance, marketing, and providing food and beverage for over 200 volunteers. While many First Night celebrations across the country are shutting their doors, we're looking for your help to keep this community event alive. All donations are tax-deductible.Every dollar counts at ARTS Missoula, serving our community at First Night Missoula and beyond. Thank you for your generosity!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I am Watercolour artist living in Hamilton, Ontario and I moved here because I fell in love with the buildings. I have a dream of painting many of the buildings that strike me as so beautiful in the downtown Hamilton area and putting them in a self published coffee table book.
Some Hamiltonians have such a negative outlook of our beautiful city and can't get past the negative aspects that I'm sure they have only heard about because if they saw these beautiful buildings through my eyes they'd also see the beauty.
After roaming around, photographing and painting this city for 6 years I have made many friends in the downtown area including the homeless, street workers and buskers and many of them see and celebrate Hamilton's beauty as well. As a matter of fact I have never felt threatened or unwelcome here.
If the folks in the fringes see it then why do the many positions, business owners and successful people I have met, that should be proud of where they live, still continuously cut it down?
It's my belief that my little coffee table book will allow people outside of Hamilton to see its beauty BEFORE they are influenced by some of the folks who seem to take pride in sharing their negative attitudes.
I want to spend this summer....
Sketching, Drawing and Painting:


I will blog and write about my adventures for the book and share the paintings as created.


I will be having my paintings available at Mixed Media here in Hamilton for Purchase as well as on display at HomeGrown Hamilton.


If I don't reach my goal I will be very happy with whatever folks have helped me with. I'll just spend more time in my work as a freelance photographer to make ends meet and less time sitting in front of buildings with my sketch books.

Other Ways You Can Help
It is a lot to ask I know but if you can't afford to contribute financially you can help me reach my goal by:


Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.


Use Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word!

<p>Our Hive will be the central art piece and effigy for a
transformational festival in Ohio. Dozens of these events occur across
the globe, and the movement is on the rise. With roots in the dreams of
activists, artists, hippies and seekers, transformational festivals create
radically free spaces where participants awaken to their inner selves and
experience a new way of being that springs from self-expression and community
interaction.</p>

Helping Hands Bring Sunshine, a private 501 (c)(3) organization, is dedicated to improving the lives of those living in Croix de Bouquets, Haiti, through community support, education, and nutrition.
 
Fran Juste, a registered nurse originally from Haiti,
founded HHBS in 2008 after multiple natural disasters devastated Haiti

HHBS has grown from a grass roots effort distributing basic necessities to hurricane victims in 2008, to rebuilding homes and schools destroyed in the earthquake of 2010, to our main focus today: supporting a school of 200+ students and faculty in the community of Croix de Bouquets
Through generation donations, HHBS rebuilt Ecole Scolaire de la Primitive, a school destroyed by the 2010 earthquake, purchased desks and blackboards, provided the necessary school supplies for each student, and in 2013 launched a program that provides one hot meal and clean drinking water for each student every day


How is HHBS Different?

Hand-to-hand distribution is what sets HHBS apart


Fran, the founder of HHBS, has a personal responsibility to make sure every donation is used to support the school
Each year, a team of HHBS Ambassadors travel to Haiti with drums full of school supplies and basic necessities
The items are hand delivered directly to the students and faculty
Please watch our video above to see hand-to-hand distribution in action

HHBS knows this level of involvement and dedication is the best way to help Haiti



How Can You Help?

We need your support to continue our mission of providing each student with education and nutrition.  Our Indiegogo campaign goal is to fully fund 20 of our 200 students for an entire school year.  Please help us feed a mind, one child at a time.



What Does it Take?
$625 Sponsors One Student for One School Year

<b>About the creator</b> 
<ul>
<li>Frame products and this campaign were created by Scott Guy - Owner and curator of Lumaframes and the Something Psychedelic collection.</li>
<li>Scott is a creative entrepreneur who currently works as a multimedia artist, freelance designer, projection installation technician and Vj.  </li>
<li>With past experience of some ten years in the video game and interactive software industry. Scott is also known to break out the gloves as a craftsman</li>
<li>Scott developed and refined the illuminated frame box design over time until it was a product he could be happy with and wanted to show in his own home. <br/>He is now hatching new plans for more exciting illuminated frame products.</li>
<li>The original motivation for making these frames was to create an interesting way to display the art my friends and myself are creating. It quickly became something more . A platform that enables artists to share their creations in a new and interesting way with a greater global audience. </li>
</ul></span></div>

~Lumaframes ~
Our Vision
The greater purpose of Lumaframes is to present a diverse collection of beautiful and inspirational art to the world through a sustainable business model and accessible product platform that in return will help support our contributing artists. 
Where we are today

We make High quality illuminated art and signage system with a multi setting remote for brightness, pattern, speed and RGBw color control

We currently offer two types of frames: Our flagship RGBw Auraframes and the classic white Lumaframes
Our low cost light weight illuminated frames are easy to ship and were designed with accessibility in mind. Our frames can ship worldwide for a fraction of the cost of traditional frames

Displayed in our unique frames, we feature a diverse selection of art created in a range of styles and media by a world class roster of artists
Lumaframes owns a large format fine art printer to print these beautiful pieces of work

50% of the profit from all sales go directly to the artist
These frames and prints have been available at www.somethingpsychedelic.com as well as in stores and galleries around Toronto, Canada
What we are working on now ?

New Frame designs are already being worked on and we have prototypes soon. We need a little time and some funds to develop the design for our new frames and create a few prototypes.  We will have the product ready after a little hard work in the next few weeks

We need to improve the efficiency of the production line and shipping process. We need paper cutting templates and other custom tools to increase efficiency and consistent quality
Working really hard to promote our Illuminated art, the frames and the Lumaframes brand and idea of independently publishing illuminated art.
I am sourcing the best possible rates on all the materials we need 
Working on my art piece for the campaign perk and some other creative projects you will eventually see on www.lumaframes.com 
What do we need to do and how are we using the funds ? 
We will produce our latest version of Auraframes as well as the new and exciting solFrames and artisanFrames


Bulk order all resources needed to create Lumaframes and the included prints 

A new set of ink and more paper ! This is a critical requirement for us to continue making prints. Our minimum ink needs will cost nearly $1000
Bulk LED order. We order rolls of high quality waterproof RGBw LED lights 
Bulk frame shell order from our local Canadian manufacturer
Website Upgrade 
Our artist roster is growing and we need a more robust online system to keep track of our product and improve customer user experience. 

Your purchases help to relaunch our website at www.lumaframes.com . Once we expand the website we can then offer more than one collection of art with more artists and art pieces as well as increase our line of frame products. 
Rental of a temporary space so that we can put our products together and safely package and send them off to our customers around the world.


We will introduce new collections featuring creators of Children's illustration, Surrealism, Sci-Fi, Fantasy and Photography
Our Relaunch :If we even get close to our goal funds will go back into the business for improving our process and to develop the website. We will also use a little of the $ to have a grand re opening party featuring top Toronto Psy scene talent and a huge showcase of Auraframes and our SomethingPsy Collection. This will be our display collection and we will be able to take it to other galleries shows and art markets. I would like to represent each artist with a few pieces and also be able to give artists demo copies.We need those funds to cover the extra ink

We have the amazing collection of international artists. We have the printer, we have the Auraframes design and we have the beginnings of a great online illuminated art sales platform.



~ If we can pass our goal what's next ? ~

Answer : Endless work to keep a business going and find time to make more art. Once we restock and are filling some orders we can begin to look forward again and continue to improve.


With large enough LED order I plan to make specifications  for prefab electronics assembly by the manufacturer (extra upfront cost saves so much time later when filling orders). 
Improve production process and tools. I have ideas for greatly reducing production costs but these processes require large orders. 
Branding refocus and website community features. I need time to arrange, design and implement all the advanced features we would like to make available to customers and artists.  

Even further ahead I have a totally new LED frame design that will be borderless and can be made much larger than our current models.  

Promotional materials and online advertising, Banners, Flyers, Biz Cards, ads, illuminate your art app. 
We would print display pieces if we have enough funds and have showings of the various collections at different events galleries and other venues.
Use display collection at art show booths and festivals. Attract more artists.
Further develop the community upload and custom print business. 
Feature Lumaframes in other online stores and retail outlets. 
Sponsor art and charity events (traveling gallery) 
Ideally I find a workable studio space to dedicate to our printing and frame assembly production. A production area and art studio with a showroom in the front one day would be perfect. I think a storefront like this would be beautiful.


About the creator 

Frame products and this campaign were created by Scott Guy - Owner and curator of Lumaframes and the Something Psychedelic collection.
Scott is a creative entrepreneur who currently works as a multimedia artist, freelance designer, projection installation technician and Vj.  
With past experience of some ten years in the video game and interactive software industry. Scott is also known to break out the gloves as a craftsman
Scott developed and refined the illuminated frame box design over time until it was a product he could be happy with and wanted to show in his own home. He is now hatching new plans for more exciting illuminated frame products.
The original motivation for making these frames was to create an interesting way to display the art my friends and myself are creating. It quickly became something more . A platform that enables artists to share their creations in a new and interesting way with a greater global audience. 

If we further develop our frame product line and improve the art collection I am confident this project will take off. Once the base structure is built up we will be able to keep the ball rolling.


Your contribution or illuminated art purchase will bring illuminated art into your home and help our business grow.  Everyone Wins ! 

Shine light into dark corners and lift your heart with illuminated visionary art.
We have been selling the highest quality translucent geclee prints in our illuminated art frames for nearly two years and are committed to improving the service and product quality over time regardless of the success of this campaign.Right now we are facing a number of challenges like having the correct materials supply and then the space the produce the orders in reasonable time. We are working towards streamlining our shipping process and some funds will be going into upgrading our production and packaging process. We have had trouble filling orders once or twice due to being low on ink or missing a light component but with a little help from our followers and the indiegogo community we can stock up so that won't ever happen again and we can deliver our visionary images to the world.  


Visionary art is a powerful movement and part of a transformational culture phenomenon. We hope to spread the positive light of these mind opening visions and inspire people to work toward a better world and relationships with each other. The color changing back lit Auraframes are the ideal platform to deliver our collection of incredible art to the world.

KEEP WATCHING THE CAMPAIGN FOR UPDATES ON OUR PROGRESS AND TO SEE THE LATEST WIP images of our new art and products coming to you soon.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, My name is Gretchen McLaren and I am a jeweler, 
blacksmith and yoga teacher from Raleigh, NC.  The plight of women and 
young girls in India is a story that deeply resonates with me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Currently
 I am residing in Bangalore, India for 6 months, volunteering with a 
group of safe hostels for young girls, schools, technical training 
centers and orphanages in South India, run by the Salesian sisters.  The
 Salesian sisters mission is to help the poor children, to educate, 
provide job training and food and safe housing for the many many poor 
and at risk young girls.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have set up the first, of what I hope 
will be many jewelry studios at one of the technical training schools 
(my second site in India so far), teaching the hostel girls  how to make
 jewelry. In 30 days they have learned to make jewelry with a minimum of
 tools and a scarcity of resources.  Together,  we have designed a line 
of jewelry, and produced samples.  In the next month  the girls hope to 
produce the samples in silver, and fill their first orders and sales 
here in India, produce stock for their very first jewelry show and get 
feedback on the designs to be produced for the Western market.  Then, 
they will produce the finished product line and I will bring this stock 
back to the US to market, distribute and sell for them.  All the money 
from the sale of the line will go directly back to these girls less 
material costs, and money for desperately needed tools.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These 
girls are extremely talented, hard working, and all of their hopes are 
pinned on this project being a success.  They view this as a livelihood,
 as a way to provide for themselves, for their families, for their 
futures.</p>
<p>My intention is to be of service to these girls and to 
create a sustainable, green business for them.  So far, we have been 
able to recycle the scrap copper wire from the on site power convertor 
shop.  This scrap copper wire has a very small return and is extremely 
expensive to buy.  By turning the scrap wire into a product for sale, 
not only are they recycling, but they are creating a huge return on 
their investment in material cost.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Right now, we are set up on a 
porch, the girls sit on mats on the floor, we are still operating out of
 the suitcase I brought, with a minimum of tools.  I am making tools out
 of anything on hand, like stainless steel wire hangers.</p>
<p>We are 
desperate for a torch and soldering equipment, more hand tools and money
 to buy silver sheet and wire to produce the line.  We have foreign 
ladies waiting to buy the jewelry, so the girls will earn money 
immediately.  Needless to say, they are very excited about this, and I 
want them to have this positive feedback for their hard work.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am launching a campaign to cover phase two of this 
project.  This will cover material and tool cost for phase two and 
hopefully a small amount of living expenses for me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My work is 
completely volunteer based.  This $2,000 that I am asking is for 
materials and tools to produce the line and a small amount of living 
expenses to support me while I am working on this project for 6 
months.  It is my hope that this campaign will exceed my wildest 
expectations and that I will also be able to upfit their broken language
 lab and buy additional tools and materials for the studio, and new 
working computers for the school and community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All the money for 
the initial campaign was spent on the tools I brought with me to India, 
and the remainder was spent on supplies and additional tools for the 
girls, once I landed in India.  To make room for all the tools, I 
brought almost no personal supplies with me.  I am still operating with 3
 sets of clothing, and no personal living supplies, so any extra 
donations so that I can cover living expenses in India is greatly 
appreciated.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have started simple and small with one suitcase of
 tools and materials to set up the studio.  The project has proceeded 
fast and smoothly and for that I am grateful.  30 days in, we are ready 
to produce the line.  I am hoping that the project will grow in time and
 that the original studio will be better outfitted, and that we be able 
to replicate the project in 36 other schools, technical training 
centers, orphanages and villages in this province in South India.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact<br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>I
 am teaching these girls a marketable skill, giving them a means so that
 they can provide for their futures, and for their families. The impact 
of the hope project on these girls is tremendous.  Daily I am watching 
them blossom and grow, gain confidence, joy and hope that they have 
found a future.   With the income they earn from the sale of the jewelry
 line, they will be able to pay for their own education, support their 
families and provide a dowry for themselves.</p>
<p>It was my goal to 
simply change the course of just one life.  I now have 5 girls who are 
very very precious to me.  I hope that we will be in each others lives 
for many years to come, that I get to follow their growth, see them be 
successful, make sure that they marry well and that they can live a life
 beyond their wildest dreams.  I love these girls. I already feel like 
this project has been successful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I
 was chosen by a non-profit organization called Home of Hope India to go
 on this trip and complete this project.  I am living with the sisters 
and the students in very simple accommodations  for 6 months.  There are
 expenses that are not being covered by this organization and that is 
why I am launching phase 2 of this campaign.  There will be no salary as
 this is completely volunteer.  I have given up my home, my studio and 
resigned from my jobs in order to go to do this.  To be clear, your 
contribution to this $2000 is allowing me to have modest living 
expenses, but more importantly, material and tools so we can produce 
this line for real.<br/><br/><div>Thank you gifts for contributing:<br/><br/>$25:  A special surprise Indian gift of my choosing from the Bangalore/Raja Market.<br/><br/>$100: 
 A special mala chain, inspired from the girls jewelry line, made from recycled materials, in India.   <br/><br/>$250:  A handmade Indian shawl/scarf<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$500:  An Indian vegetarian meal cooked by me, from recipes learned during my stay in India.<br/><br/>$1000:  A traditional beautiful sari from India <br/>
</div>
<div>
<br/>All thank you gifts will be sent upon return from India.  Please include your shipping address when contributing.  Please note that contributions made through Pay Pal will reach us right away, contributions made by credit card are distributed to us after the campaign ends.<br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please Please Please share this on Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, email, text or by word of mouth!</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, your support means so much 
to me by passing this campaign on to your community.  Thank you!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you are a jeweler, blacksmith, jewelry tool or jewelry material supplier and you have new, extra or used jewelry tools that you can donate to these girls, please email me at gretchenmclaren@yahoo.com and I will put you in touch with someone that will carry the tools over to me in mid-October.  I'm making tools out of coat hangers so I'll take anything you are willing to contribute.  Thank you, thank you.<br/></p>

It is essential that our society have a Criminal Justice System that addresses crime in ways that ensure public safety. It is also essential that offenders have access to quality legal services. It is in the interest of all that we have a system of laws that are equitably administrated and a Correctional System that is humane.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>October 29, 2012 – January 28, 2013</strong></p>
<p>Our Second exhibition, <strong>Expressing the Social Conscience: Art Prints and Human Rights</strong> will coincide with IFPDA Print Fair. The objective of this show is to feature fine arts prints dealing with issues of human rights in order to demonstrate the rich variegation of the medium but also to convey the immediacy of their social message. </p>
<p>Human rights issues are the most appropriate themes for this medium because the print has been historically used to reach the greatest number of people. This has been the case with Ukiyo-e Japanese prints in the Yoshiwara district that depicted performers, and actors, as well as geishas and sumo wrestlers. It was also the case in Holland as seen in the prints of Rembrandt van Rijn whose objective was to disseminate Christian values to the masses by making prints cheaply and affordable to the masses. In the United States of the thirties we saw a proliferation of posters and prints igniting the fires of many a union rally or political event as well as protest against racism and inequity. Consequently, the print is the most democratic medium capable of reaching the largest amount of people and affecting the most change. It is the intent of this show to impact viewers through its content but also through its medium which in itself is of social relevance.</p>
<p>Some of the artists to be featured:</p>
<p>David Wojnarowicz was a deeply committed gay rights activist/artist who documented his final stages of AIDS.</p>
<p>Willie Cole uses his iron stamping to channel the exploitation of the black population (his mother ironed clothes to make a living) into an aesthetic expression.</p>
<p>Leon Golub represents the classic political art through his unique representation of apartheid.</p>
<p>Kara Walker confronts stereotypical images of black women in our society.</p>
<p>Christiane Baumgartner takes video stills of military imagery and transfers them to the quintessential German medium of woodcut, calling up questions of national identity.</p>
<p> Sue Coe deals with injustice on an ongoing basis and fights injustice and inequity both visually and personally by working in African villages helping the poor.</p>
<p>Faith Ringgold’s Declaration of Independence and Letters from a Birmingham Jail Suites are powerful visual documents for the fight towards emancipation of African Americans.</p>
<p>Ralph Fassanella, Philip Reisman and Paul Marcus create etchings that deal with the working classes, the unions and labor.</p>

<p><span>Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo are said to be among the worst places in the world to be a child.  Our project will show the untold story how art is changing the future of Africa.</span></p>

<p><span>In this area, boys as young as 7 are kidnapped and forced to fight in rebel armies. Many are psychologically tortured and brainwashed to commit atrocities against their own families.

<h2><span><strong>Art About Art:</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>This is a trip where we will produce art about kids who use art.  The project will be in a country where art, music, and dance are a second language, a huge piece of the culture.</span></p>
<p><span>“When the children draw, dance, and sing…we see them come to life again. They begin to forget their wounds for a time.”</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>Project Deliverables:</strong></span></h2>
<p>Our project will span almost a year</p>
<p><span><strong>Phase 1 </strong>- At the beginning of this project and during our first trip we hope to collect and create several signature art pieces for a traveling gallery exhibit with multiple showings. These pieces will be a part of the perks given out digitally to those that support us.  (see support section)</span></p>
<p><span><br/>We will create traveling exhibits of the artwork, digital versions of the stories and artwork, and a short documentary-style, multiple media experience for the gallery exhibits and the web.</span></p>
<p><strong>Phase 2</strong> – Mid 2013 will mark preparing the release of the documentary highlighting insightful stories of art, music and a culture of art and how they are shaping the future leadership of Africa. The impact and amount we can do on this documentary depends on how much we raise in this campaign.  We will at least do a short documentary in phase two but We hope to exceed our giving goal to pay for a second trip to Africa and for materials for the classes so everyone can participate in the project over the course of almost an entire year.</p>
<p>Our first trip will be in September 2012.  We hope to make another trip in the spring or summer of 2013 to finish up and follow our story of leadership transformation through the use of the arts in Africa.</p>
<p>Jeremy Cowart will passionately create composite art works on the front half and the back half of these trips.   We will show our films and artwork along the way and debut the final film mid 2013.</p>

<li>Original Gallery Composites:  ‘Jeremy Cowart Original’ curated art pieces will be created on site with the children and will be featured in a special gallery exhibit in the United States.  We hope to help supply art materials to Exile centers so that we may watch and participate in the ongoing stories for a period of one year.</li>
<li>Documentary Feature Film revealing the passion, sounds, and vision of a powerful future these children have.  The film will be an inspirational story of children of war becoming leaders for peace while living in one of the worst places to be a child.   How much we raise here will determine our budget for this feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeremy Cowart will pair his passion for humanitarian storytelling with the art, photography, and filmmaking of this special project.</p>
<p>A special exhibit with unique work from the beginning project will be scheduled first quarter of 2013.   A special Documentary will expand the voice of Painting a Future of Peace and will also be released mid year 2013.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Different about our Story?</strong></h2>
<p>The story of child soldiers has been told by many organizations.  There are several great international aid groups working actively to end these conflicts in the African region.    The damage to the future has long been done.  These groups are working to stop the cycle.   </p>
<p>Our team and our story are concerned about the next phase.  The “what happens next” question.   We are telling this story about how these same children are becoming powerful leaders of the future.  The big difference in Africa is the substantial impact the arts have on crafting leadership of the future.  </p>
<p>Our ongoing passion for this project will be creating a sustainable and lasting impact on the viewer thru art – composites of art – and film that will perpetuate and celebrate a form of art that empowers child survivors of war to become their country’s next leaders for peace.   It’s a celebration of art.</p>
<p>There is no better way to create a strong future than through the use of art. </p>

<strong>Vision of Exile International - partners on </strong><strong>the ground in Africa: </strong>
</h3>
<p>Our vision for these children is not only that they survive war, but to empower them to be leaders of peace in their communities. We believe that the very thing they thought would kill them can bring life by teaching them to dream again. To be peacemakers.  We believe they are more than what they were forced to do or what has been done to them. In art and expressive therapy they find life again by walking through the rehabilitative process. They find redemption. We invite you into this story of watching pain become purpose. Stepping into a story of former child soldiers becoming leaders of peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness. It's magical. </p>
<h3><strong>Funding for the Project and “Stretch Funding” for Peace Clubs and Art Centers: </strong></h3>
<p>Funding to this project will go to pay travel expenses and production costs for the large format art composites and the documentary.  For nearly a year we will document weekly art therapy groups lead by local African counselors focusing on trauma care, forgiveness, peace-building, and leadership skills for former LRA child soldiers and child survivors of war. The Art and Rehabilitative House in Congo  would be used as a center to provide former child soldiers a safe place to have art therapy groups to paint, draw, create, and dance again. </p>

<p>2 Blocks of Art are celebratory events conceived and produced by Urban Solutions to promote artists, small businesses and community-based organizations in San Francisco’s emerging Central Market neighborhood. They feature local artistic talent in storefronts, retail businesses, community centers and galleries on 6<sup>th</sup> Street as well as outdoor street performances along Market Street. With over 100 local artists exhibiting or performing in 25 locations, the art walks strengthen the overall identity and vitality of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>2 Blocks of Art showcases a neighborhood rich in culture and well known for its cutting edge arts community. Now in its third year and growing, Urban Solutions started 2 Blocks of Art on Sixth Street between Market and Howard. With the San Francisco Arts Commission as a partner this year, the events extend to Market Street from Fifth to Seventh Streets with dance, live music and interactive murals. New this year, there will be an arts market and children’s activities on Minna and Natoma Alleys.</p>
<p>A tremendous collaborative effort, participating organizations include Bindlestiff Studio, Inks of Truth, Kularts, Intersection for the Arts, Burning Man, Scrap, and Grey Area Foundation for the Arts as well as galleries Satellite 66, 1AM, Laura Kudritzki Photography, and the Luggage Store.</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE THE NEIGHBORHOOD The events are easily accessible from either Civic Center or Powell Street BART stations in San Francisco.  Come out to Sixth Street between Market and Howard and Market Street between 5<sup>th</sup> Street and 7<sup>th</sup> Street on <strong>September 28 or</strong> <strong>October 19</strong> from 4-8pm to enjoy the art and discover something new about the neighborhood. <a href=""http://www.urbansolutionssf.org/news_events/artwalk.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See the map and exhibitions</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My name is Leslie E. Vigerstaff, i am a retired company director based near Manchester in England and have a keen and avid interest in pictorial and sculptural Art. I have always enjoyed life, am a self-motivated person but do need an interest in life, something to drive me, a reason to be. After a couple of years retirement i find i need to be doing something more with my life but, i want my second working life to benefit others who are less fortunate than I. As i was pondering my future i had a revelation, if i combined my interest in the Arts with my ownership of a number of Original Works and used them to benefit other struggling and impoverished Artists around the world, what could be better than that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>My ""eureka"" moment ... i immediately knew where my future work lay.</b></p>
<p>Over the years, having observed, listened and spoken to many struggling and impoverished Artists i feel i understand the difficulties Artists have in general. They are ""creative people"", they need time to dream their next masterpiece, then create it ... but they still need to eat, to pay the rent etc.</p>
<p>My ""second working life"" i believe, is to create an Artists Gallery, an Artists Cooperative in fact, that will be a ""shop window to the world"" for all such struggling and impoverished Artists around the world. This project will be a venue for a permanent exhibition, a means of Display, Marketing and Sales procedures handled for and on behalf of the Artists by members of the Artists cooperative and at no cost to the Artists whom we help and assist using this method.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Why the name Gallery Boonma you might ask:</b></p>
<p>Let me tell you a very true story. A number of years ago, whilst travelling around South East Asia, i came across what can only be described as an Artists Commune and small gallery. I noticed a charcoal and pastel drawing lying to one side, even from such a distance it took my breath away, as i became closer my emotions were running wild, the intricate and finite detail plus the light emanating from the subjects eyes was amazing. I asked to be introduced to the Artist, his name was Boonlert Boonma. He proceeded to show me his work, when you feel the way i do about Art it can be deeply moving, the fascination stirs the emotions, shapes, forms and structures personality, it is able to expose the raw edges of your physche, consume energy, until such time as that image in hung on your wall, in your own in-house gallery.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>I am sure all lovers of Art will understand what i am trying to convey in my words:</b></p>
<p>I was able to purchase a small number of Boonma's Original Works and at that time, arranged and agreed with Boonma that i would employ his services, that i would order and pre-pay for the works he produced for and on my behalf, that way i would have copyright to the works i purchased from Boonma. All went well for a couple of years or so, but since late 2009 Boonma seems to have disappeared, he does not respond to telephone calls, texts or email, friends visiting the area have asked about him, all to no avail, Boonma and his family seem to be lost.</p>
<p>My deepest joy would be for such Works of Art be used to assist other such Artists in their endeavors. Therefore, it is my intention to use Boonlert Boonma's Original Artwork to create a new Artists Cooperative dedicated to Boonlert Boonma via a Limited Edition run of Prints of his amazing work. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Hence the name Gallery Boonma Artists Cooperative:</b></p>
<p>I believe that all Artists need and avenue of contribution, they need Backers and Patrons [people like you]. Where would the likes of Da Vinci, Degas, Van Gogh, Vermeer be without their backers, patrons, family, friends and acquaintances, they surely would not have survived. We would not have the glorious paintings and sculptures that we gaze upon today, in such reverence and awe, in galleries around the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Will you help me, help them:</b></p>
<p>I have leased space on the first floor of a 18,000 sq ft warehouse and office building at the Riverside Business Park complex in Greater Manchester, North West England. I have started the necessary refurbishment work to create the gallery, have gained the necessary local authority planning permissions and permits, have started to build and fit-out the display areas [photographs below] but far from being a wealthy man we need further funds to complete the work, approximately 88,900 USD. We need high-tech digital graphic printing machines, office furniture and computers, gallery website and optimization services, compliance with the Public Health &amp; Safety regimes that apply to such a venue, specialist gallery lighting, artwork display walls and racks etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>But one person can only do so much, you the Backer, the Gallery Patron, can and will make a difference to this project, will you help ..?</p>
<p>I truly believe that Boonma's charcoal, chalk and pastel Works of Art are, without doubt, sublime creations and that like minded people will appreciate the artistry, the expertise, the fine exquisite strokes of an artists mind, encompassed and contained in the superb images.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How i intend to raise the funds required to complete this project.</b></p>
<p>Over the years i purchased 74 Boonma Original Works of Art, i intend to allow sixty [60] to become Limited Edition Prints to a maximum of 500 of each work and size. The Limited Edition Prints will be very high quality, very high resolution digital prints and for the initial Backers and Gallery Patrons will be priced at deep discount to the Gallery Boonma Recommended Retail Price [GBRRP] of a print once the gallery is complete and open to the general public, displaying the Artists Cooperative members pictorial and sculptural artwork alongside Boonma's own work.</p>
<p>Example: 30x20 GBRRP = 99.00 USD each - Backer/Patron x 60 = 52.53 USD each   </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Example: 30x20 GBRRP = 63.00 GBP each - Backer/Patron x 60 = 33.25 GBP each</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Exchange Rate used is 1.58 USD = 1.00 GBP</p>
<p>Each Backer or Patron of the Gallery will have their choice of Limited Edition Prints from [1] to a maximum of [10] per Backer or Patron. I further believe that every Backer or Patron of the Gallery deserves the highest priority, therefore i have attempted to create the unique ""perks program"" to suit people from all walks of life and all levels of contribution.</p>
<p>No matter what level of funding we reach, high or low, all is required and every penny will be invested in either the Gallery Boonma Artists Cooperative project, and once complete, the balance will fund the Artists of the now and of the future, in there endeavors in the pictorial and sculptural mediums.</p>
<p>Each Artwork will be ""Frame Ready"" on very high quality 235 GSM Satin Art Paper using eight colour professional print and UV fade resistant inks to ensure the exact  and finite detail contained in Boonma's work.</p>
<p>To ensure that the Backers and Patrons of the Gallery receive their Works of Art in the immediate future, wherever in the world they reside, we have initially contracted with a very high quality professional Digital and Graphics printing company to supply the primary Artwork prints to enable me to fulfill each Backer and Gallery Patrons requirement and would expect to begin shipping the Works or Art within two weeks of completion of funding, target date being first week December 2013.</p>
<p>Each Work/s of Art will be shipped by DHL/FedEx/UPS in specific Artwork Transit Tubes to prevent damage in delivery. If, by any remote chance, damage is caused in transit a simple digital photograph of the damage is required and on receipt of same and the print in question a replacement/s will immediately be sent out to you.</p>
<p>I really do thank you for the time spent in perusing the Gallery Boonma Artists Cooperative project. But, i do ask you to spend a little more time in pondering the Artwork [shown below] created by Boonma, it is most worthy off your time, worthy of your investment and a worthy addition to your in-house Gallery, as it is in mine.</p>
<p>There will only be 500 of each, when they are gone, they are gone.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Leslie E. Vigerstaff</p>

Digital Images of Boonma's Original Works of Art
for this one-time run of Limited Edition Prints are shown below this Introduction
Gallery Boonma Artists Cooperative

My name is Leslie E. Vigerstaff, i am a retired company director based near Manchester in England and have a keen and avid interest in pictorial and sculptural Art. I have always enjoyed life, am a self-motivated person but do need an interest in life, something to drive me, a reason to be. After a couple of years retirement i find i need to be doing something more with my life but, i want my second working life to benefit others who are less fortunate than I. As i was pondering my future i had a revelation, if i combined my interest in the Arts with my ownership of a number of Original Works and used them to benefit other struggling and impoverished Artists around the world, what could be better than that.
My ""eureka"" moment ... i immediately knew where my future work lay.
Over the years, having observed, listened and spoken to many struggling and impoverished Artists i feel i understand the difficulties Artists have in general. They are ""creative people"", they need time to dream their next masterpiece, then create it ... but they still need to eat, to pay the rent etc.
My ""second working life"" i believe, is to create an Artists Gallery, an Artists Cooperative in fact, that will be a ""shop window to the world"" for all such struggling and impoverished Artists around the world. This project will be a venue for a permanent exhibition, a means of Display, Marketing and Sales procedures handled for and on behalf of the Artists by members of the Artists cooperative and at no cost to the Artists whom we help and assist using this method.
Why the name Gallery Boonma you might ask:
Let me tell you a very true story. A number of years ago, whilst travelling around South East Asia, i came across what can only be described as an Artists Commune and small gallery. I noticed a charcoal and pastel drawing lying to one side, even from such a distance it took my breath away, as i became closer my emotions were running wild, the intricate and finite detail plus the light emanating from the subjects eyes was amazing. I asked to be introduced to the Artist, his name was Boonlert Boonma. He proceeded to show me his work, when you feel the way i do about Art it can be deeply moving, the fascination stirs the emotions, shapes, forms and structures personality, it is able to expose the raw edges of your physche, consume energy, until such time as that image in hung on your wall, in your own in-house gallery.
I am sure all lovers of Art will understand what i am trying to convey in my words:
I was able to purchase a small number of Boonma's Original Works and at that time, arranged and agreed with Boonma that i would employ his services, that i would order and pre-pay for the works he produced for and on my behalf, that way i would have copyright to the works i purchased from Boonma. All went well for a couple of years or so, but since late 2009 Boonma seems to have disappeared, he does not respond to telephone calls, texts or email, friends visiting the area have asked about him, all to no avail, Boonma and his family seem to be lost.
My deepest joy would be for such Works of Art be used to assist other such Artists in their endeavors. Therefore, it is my intention to use Boonlert Boonma's Original Artwork to create a new Artists Cooperative dedicated to Boonlert Boonma via a Limited Edition run of Prints of his amazing work. 
Hence the name Gallery Boonma Artists Cooperative:
I believe that all Artists need and avenue of contribution, they need Backers and Patrons [people like you]. Where would the likes of Da Vinci, Degas, Van Gogh, Vermeer be without their backers, patrons, family, friends and acquaintances, they surely would not have survived. We would not have the glorious paintings and sculptures that we gaze upon today, in such reverence and awe, in galleries around the world.
Will you help me, help them:
I have leased space on the first floor of a 18,000 sq ft warehouse and office building at the Riverside Business Park complex in Greater Manchester, North West England. I have started the necessary refurbishment work to create the gallery, have gained the necessary local authority planning permissions and permits, have started to build and fit-out the display areas [photographs below] but far from being a wealthy man we need further funds to complete the work, approximately 88,900 USD. We need high-tech digital graphic printing machines, office furniture and computers, gallery website and optimization services, compliance with the Public Health & Safety regimes that apply to such a venue, specialist gallery lighting, artwork display walls and racks etc, etc, etc.
But one person can only do so much, you the Backer, the Gallery Patron, can and will make a difference to this project, will you help ..?
I truly believe that Boonma's charcoal, chalk and pastel Works of Art are, without doubt, sublime creations and that like minded people will appreciate the artistry, the expertise, the fine exquisite strokes of an artists mind, encompassed and contained in the superb images.
How i intend to raise the funds required to complete this project.
Over the years i purchased 74 Boonma Original Works of Art, i intend to allow sixty [60] to become Limited Edition Prints to a maximum of 500 of each work and size. The Limited Edition Prints will be very high quality, very high resolution digital prints and for the initial Backers and Gallery Patrons will be priced at deep discount to the Gallery Boonma Recommended Retail Price [GBRRP] of a print once the gallery is complete and open to the general public, displaying the Artists Cooperative members pictorial and sculptural artwork alongside Boonma's own work.
Example: 30x20 GBRRP = 99.00 USD each - Backer/Patron x 60 = 52.53 USD each   
Example: 30x20 GBRRP = 63.00 GBP each - Backer/Patron x 60 = 33.25 GBP each
Exchange Rate used is 1.58 USD = 1.00 GBP
Each Backer or Patron of the Gallery will have their choice of Limited Edition Prints from [1] to a maximum of [10] per Backer or Patron. I further believe that every Backer or Patron of the Gallery deserves the highest priority, therefore i have attempted to create the unique ""perks program"" to suit people from all walks of life and all levels of contribution.
No matter what level of funding we reach, high or low, all is required and every penny will be invested in either the Gallery Boonma Artists Cooperative project, and once complete, the balance will fund the Artists of the now and of the future, in there endeavors in the pictorial and sculptural mediums.
Each Artwork will be ""Frame Ready"" on very high quality 235 GSM Satin Art Paper using eight colour professional print and UV fade resistant inks to ensure the exact  and finite detail contained in Boonma's work.
To ensure that the Backers and Patrons of the Gallery receive their Works of Art in the immediate future, wherever in the world they reside, we have initially contracted with a very high quality professional Digital and Graphics printing company to supply the primary Artwork prints to enable me to fulfill each Backer and Gallery Patrons requirement and would expect to begin shipping the Works or Art within two weeks of completion of funding, target date being first week December 2013.
Each Work/s of Art will be shipped by DHL/FedEx/UPS in specific Artwork Transit Tubes to prevent damage in delivery. If, by any remote chance, damage is caused in transit a simple digital photograph of the damage is required and on receipt of same and the print in question a replacement/s will immediately be sent out to you.
I really do thank you for the time spent in perusing the Gallery Boonma Artists Cooperative project. But, i do ask you to spend a little more time in pondering the Artwork [shown below] created by Boonma, it is most worthy off your time, worthy of your investment and a worthy addition to your in-house Gallery, as it is in mine.
There will only be 500 of each, when they are gone, they are gone.
Sincerely
Leslie E. Vigerstaff

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><b><i>Catchin’ Babies, Colonizing
Black Bodies</i></b>, seeks to note the
historical persecution of Diasporic traditional birthing practices and bodies
by providing a historical narrative and illustrative examples of how
colonialism and the medicalization of birth impacted southern Black
grandmother/granny midwifery and Caribbean midwifery in the early 20th century.
We borrow from early Black communities in the American South usage of the term
‘catchin’ babies’ to describe midwifery to offer homage to this centuries-old
practice. This collaborative project highlights Prof. Bonaparte’s
socio-historical research on physicians’ written advocacy against Black
midwives and my artwork on the role of colonialism in Diasporic environs.

<p>Grandmother midwives or granny/nana midwives were an
integral part of birthing traditions throughout the African Diaspora, most
particularly in the early U.S. South and in the Caribbean.  These midwives
were typically older women, had a spiritual “calling” to the profession, held
an apprenticeship until the older midwife retired, or followed a matrilineal
family tradition of midwifery, and were post-menopausal in some instances.
Granny midwives practicing in America in the early 1700s through the early
1900s tended to be African American, functioned as birth attendants, healers
and herbalists, were based in rural settings, and served in pivotal leadership
positions (and for some religions) within their communities.  Similar to
their American counterparts, Jamaican midwives (known as nanas) also served as
birthing attendants, healers, and herbalists in their communities.  A
common theme between how midwives of color practiced in the U.S. and in Jamaica
is a rising concern regarding maternality rates. In the late 19th and early
20th centuries, White male doctors in the U.S. pathologized pregnancy and
medicalized birth.  Whereas in certain Caribbean nations such as Jamaica
and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, due to rising maternal mortality rates, maternity
hospitals were established and served as sites of midwifery practices thanks to

Black Bodies, seeks to note the
historical persecution of Diasporic traditional birthing practices and bodies
by providing a historical narrative and illustrative examples of how
colonialism and the medicalization of birth impacted southern Black
grandmother/granny midwifery and Caribbean midwifery in the early 20th century.
We borrow from early Black communities in the American South usage of the term
‘catchin’ babies’ to describe midwifery to offer homage to this centuries-old
practice. This collaborative project highlights Prof. Bonaparte’s
socio-historical research on physicians’ written advocacy against Black
midwives and my artwork on the role of colonialism in Diasporic environs.

Grandmother midwives or granny/nana midwives were an
integral part of birthing traditions throughout the African Diaspora, most
particularly in the early U.S. South and in the Caribbean.  These midwives
were typically older women, had a spiritual “calling” to the profession, held
an apprenticeship until the older midwife retired, or followed a matrilineal
family tradition of midwifery, and were post-menopausal in some instances.
Granny midwives practicing in America in the early 1700s through the early
1900s tended to be African American, functioned as birth attendants, healers
and herbalists, were based in rural settings, and served in pivotal leadership
positions (and for some religions) within their communities.  Similar to
their American counterparts, Jamaican midwives (known as nanas) also served as
birthing attendants, healers, and herbalists in their communities.  A
common theme between how midwives of color practiced in the U.S. and in Jamaica
is a rising concern regarding maternality rates. In the late 19th and early
20th centuries, White male doctors in the U.S. pathologized pregnancy and
medicalized birth.  Whereas in certain Caribbean nations such as Jamaica
and Trinidad & Tobago, due to rising maternal mortality rates, maternity
hospitals were established and served as sites of midwifery practices thanks to
the advocacy of doctors and other healthcare practitioners.  So,
although Caribbean midwives served as primary birth attendants, they like
granny midwives in the southern U.S., operated under similar edicts of seeing
birth as an unnatural occurrence that required medical intervention thank to
the influence of Eurocentric birthing ideals. This post-colonial shift from
healing to medical intervention had a lasting impact on the bodies of Black
people in both of these regions.  Colonialism
functions as an axis of economic oppression which resulted in what Foucault
terms a biopolitics that controlled Black bodies and birthing attendants.
 This control of Black bodies resulted in a social inheritance of

<p>The goal is to make it possible to support this residency at whatever fiscal level you can afford.  $1 to $1,000, we don't want to leave anyone out who wants to be a patron for good in this world.  The $450 base will cover the residency fee, monies raised above and beyond that will help defray the costs of firing kilns, ceramic materials, groceries, and transportation.</p>
<p>If you ARE supportive, but just can't manage a fiscal contribution right now-</p>
<p>        *Get the word out about this opportunity to your community!</p>
<p>        *Follow Red Lodge Clay Center or Whistlepig Studio so you'll know when the   residents are in Red Lodge and send care packages to them. Helping defray their out-of-pocket costs!</p>
<p>Thanks, and remember:  DO GOOD!</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Who is Marguerite Joyce Wood
Marguerite Joyce Wood set forth the intention of DOING GOOD in all her children.  Joy was always engaged in learning or executing a new craft, for several years she ran a small ceramic shop in Missouri, and she always had space at her table for an extra friend.


What We're Building
The ""MJ Wood Memorial Short-Term Residency Fund"" will support ceramic artists who wish to develop a body of work with a socially-conscious spirit, a sense of community engagement, and the intent to DO GOOD with their creativity and skill. The residency will occur under the umbrella of Red Lodge Clay Center's studio in Red Lodge, MT where residents artists will have the opportunity to work in a first-class facility for one month.  Their project will also receive international attention through the Red Lodge Clay Center website. Supporters of the Residency Fund will be able to follow not only the growth of the fund, but also the work produced by it on Jill's blog at whistlepigstudio.blogspot.com  
 
Who we are
 
Michael Hutton and Jill Foote-Hutton have committed to an annual contribution of $450 to underwrite a one month short-term residency at Red Lodge Clay Center, but would like to see this opportunity take root and grow into an endowment. Both Michael and Jill are vested in the development of socially-conscious craft endeavors, and want to create an opportunity supported by regular folks who believe in the power of craft, a single action, and one dollar.

<p><br/>Two summers ago I received a $4,000 grant from Orange County Tourism to help make that dream a reality.  Through crowd funding, I raised another $2,000.  I went about working out ideas with members of our small village community.  Going door to door, getting to know business owners, and my neighbors.  Here are <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/Greenwood-Lake-Mural-Project/x/40171"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""last campaign"">links</a> to the last 2 <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1661257022/greenwood-lake-mural-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""1st campaign"">campaigns</a>. </p>
<p><br/>Everyone was very excited about the prospect, and we went ahead with making these removable panels of artwork by village resident artists.  Each panel depicts a landscape of Greenwood Lake painted right here in our village through different seasons. </p>
<p><br/>Of course, the first ever big art project in a small village isn't always created without causing some controversy.  You can read about ours in this <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/nyregion/17towns.html?_r=2&amp;ref=ourtowns&amp;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""New York Times Article"">New York Times article</a>.</p>

<p><br/>People are becoming more hopeful about the future of Greenwood Lake.  There is a feeling that a tipping point approaches for the village, and every small improvement goes a long way towards that point. We are more inspired to participate in the fate of our lake, our neighbors, our businesses, and we support others who do the same.  Rob Reiner even came and made a <a href=""http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/movies/the-magic-of-belle-isle-by-rob-reiner-with-morgan-freeman.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""film"">film</a> here in the summer of 2011.<br/> </p>
<p>The panels have amazingly survived the test of two brutal hurricanes in their two year residence at Barnaby Prints.  They've also traveled to Newburgh for an event celebrating Orange County Tourism Arts Grant recipients, bringing our Greenwood Lake creative spirit with them.</p>

</div></div>","An exhibition of works on body and works on paper

I am working with breeding words to create icons that represent the dynamic forms of memory that we carry with us.


I am sitting with architecture, capturing and erasing the history of passing light while balancing gesture, bilaterally.

I am multiplying and mutating the iconic forms I discover through applied techniques.


I am interested in the cyclic degeneration and regeneration of ideas, lives, and materials. 


  My 3rd solo exhibition, CARBON, is being presented by the independent curatorial team MARSO at Polyforum Siqueiros in coordination with programming at MUNAL (Museo Nacional de Arte) and Zona Maco, Mexico City's internationally recognized contemporary art fair.

My residency includes
Two weeks working in Mexico City (April 1-14) in which my flight, additional materials, space, and boarding are granted, as well as a three month solo exhibition (opening April 19) in a beautiful building that was designed around massive murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros.  

     Your donation will allow me to
Enter process and establish my ideas and techniques to generate new work.  I needâ€¦
- time, space, materials, gasoline to sustain a studio practice prior to my short residency period in Mexico City.  
- to orchestrate shipments, and design/construct visual artifacts for performative and installation aspects of my show.
- afford a videographer, photographer, and editor to document the work both for visual presentation and proper archiving.
- to afford food, transit, and my interactions with the community while in Mexico City.

     The Impact
This would have on my exhibition and personal trajectory into the creative unknown is of course, immeasurable.  My current work has received much international attention and acclaim, mostly to the credit of viral activity on art and design blogs and media.  I continue to gain the support of collectors and gallerists, but I have not been able to sustain a studio practice.  My existence has been quite nomadic for the past few years, and while I honor the effects of that fuel, I am eager to make space.

     You can also
Help me broaden my audience by passing my campaign along to a friend who might be interested in my cause, or by posting a link to my campaign on your facebook, twitter, or blog.

<p><span><strong>WHAT IS ALCHEMIA?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Alchemia </span><span>provides arts programming for adults with developmental disabilities who identify as artists or who are passionate about deepening their artistic, social, and communication skills through the expressive arts. Alchemia is committed to providing a physically, socially, and artistically nourishing environment where participants can develop and sustain strong interpersonal relationships, pursue individual creative goals, and explore their unique dreams.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>WHAT IS “CREATED EQUAL” ABOUT?</strong></span></p>
<p>“Created Equal” will be a documentary about the artists of Alchemia, who display and sell their artwork at the A.W.O.L (Artists Without Labels) gallery in Petaluma, California. This film allows the artists to tell their own stories in their unique words and images. As their art is brought to life through animation, the audience will learn the inspiring stories of each Alchemia artist and what their creations mean to them. The film will also focus on the cycle of joy and positive emotions created when these artists show and sell their work to the public.</p>
<p>The artists of Alchemia are the most optimistic and courageous people I have ever met, and it is a privilege to teach and create with them They are inspiring individuals who can show us all a great deal about what it means to live a passionate, purposeful life. When you meet them through the “Created Equal” film, you will understand and appreciate the joy of what it really means to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES JULIE NEWMAR HAVE TO DO WITH THE PROJECT?</strong></p>
<p>Julie (Catwoman) Newmar has agreed to narrate “Created Equal”. I met her in the 1980”s at the Barnsdall Park Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted her sitting alone on the floor, leaning over her toddler. He was reaching up and playing with her long blonde hair. As I looked closer, I saw that her son had Down’s Syndrome. Like many other fans, I had always been in love with Catwoman, and this scene touched my heart and has remained there all these years. I contacted her when I started the “Created Equal” project and sent her some of the work my students had created.. She loved the films we have done in our Alchemia Animation class, such as “Parking” and “Trash Talk”. She was so enthusiastic about this project that she agreed to do the narration and I am so proud and honored to have her play a key role in this special film.</p>
<p><span><strong>WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?</strong></span></p>
<p>$20,000 will get us good editing, some archival footage, animation, and music. It will also allow us to enter film festivals and promote the film to find a distributor. The goal is to finish the film by early Fall. If we get more than we ask for, we will be able to afford a higher quality production. If we get less, the film will still get made, but it may be a short instead of a feature.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WILL YOU GET FOR YOUR DONATION?</strong></p>
<p>At different donation levels, donors will get perks such as a ""thank you"" in the film credits, “Created Equal Crew” T shirts, a DVD of the film, an Alchema artist’s drawing of your car, a two-hour caricature session by the director of the film, photos of Catwoman autographed by Julie Newmar, and an associate producer credit in the film.</p>
<p><strong>TELL ME ABOUT THE FILMMAKER</strong></p>
<p>Gene Hamm, is an animation instructor at Academy of Art University San Francisco, CA, and animation and special effects instructor at Alchemia.

 World! My name is Noah Saunders and I'm asking you for a small 
donation to procure the sum of $2,584 to manifest the answer to my prayer.... </p><h3>The Story</h3><p>I've
 been a full time metal sculptor for the past 20 years. About ten years 
ago I got a bag of clay and went about making little pots by hand 
knowing next to nothing about what I was doing and very scared that I 
would 'make a mistake'.  However, this naivety led me to create hand 
built forms with great proficiency and uniqueness.  Soon I had  hundreds
 of round bottom bowls laying all over my studio!  Looking over my 
""collection"" one day, I thought why not make these bowls into something 
more complete.  Merging my knowledge of metal forging with my new 
passion for ceramics I transformed my bowls into Chalices!  Creating a 
unique method of attaching a copper base to a ceramic form, holding it 
together with tension - no glue or solder!  Around this time I had been 
volunteering at a local clay studio which gave me access to a lot of 
great equipment and clay, feeding my passion!  </p><h3>The Story Takes on Twist<br/>
</h3><p>The
 copper on the clay body had a very ancient feel to it and one day I 
showed my new body of work to a dear friend who is an Egyptologist.  He 
was very excited about what I was doing and said that I ought to study 
the ceramics of the Ancient Near East.  I went straight the library and 
felt like I had found a time and people that were kindred spirits as the
 work I saw was just like mine!!!  But not quite as  the clay that was 
used in the BC was fired at a much lower temperature and glaze had not 
been invented yet.  Near Eastern ceramics had a much more organic feel 
that was really inspiring. I went to the studio I was working in and 
announced that I wanted to create forms that were inspired by the work 
of the Ancient Near East; I wanted to be a B.C. Potter! My announcement 
was responded with by a wall of resistance. :(  .  Most ceramic artist 
had little knowledge of the work of the Near East and were not open to 
aiding me on my quest to create the clay forms using a more ancient 
language.  Undeterred, I continued to experiment and work in the studio 
hoping that I could find a happy medium using their required materials 
but trying top create a BC feel. Soon however it became apparent that I 
could not use the High fired clay to make a form satisfactory for what I
 envisioned.  I felt like a B.C. boy trapped in an A.D. world!  </p><h3>Never give UP!!!</h3>Through
 the encouragement of friends, I did lots of research finding the exact 
forms I wanted to make, along with the clays that would be appropriate 
to make a chalice that had a real B.C. feel. Armed with this research  I
 hit the streets and asked every potter and public clay studio I could 
find about using their  kilns - I might as well have been carrying a 
skunk!!!  No one wished to open there kiln to me - the work was just too
 far outside of the norm. I wanted to make low fired forms made of red 
and black clays which would look so nice next to the copper, clay bodies
 that were unglazed having the BC look that I am so called to create! It
 was starting to feel like a novel that was doomed to be never be 
published.  Exhausted I shelved the idea for a few years. Good ideas die
 hard I guess because soon my home and computer became so full of books 
and images of work that inspired me, it was all I would talk about.  The
 BC was banging on my creative door and I was either going to honor this
 dream or have to kill it!<p>  </p><h3>Prayer is Answered!<br/>

 World! My name is Noah Saunders and I'm asking you for a small 
donation to procure the sum of $2,584 to manifest the answer to my prayer.... The StoryI've
 been a full time metal sculptor for the past 20 years. About ten years 
ago I got a bag of clay and went about making little pots by hand 
knowing next to nothing about what I was doing and very scared that I 
would 'make a mistake'.  However, this naivety led me to create hand 
built forms with great proficiency and uniqueness.  Soon I had  hundreds
 of round bottom bowls laying all over my studio!  Looking over my 
""collection"" one day, I thought why not make these bowls into something 
more complete.  Merging my knowledge of metal forging with my new 
passion for ceramics I transformed my bowls into Chalices!  Creating a 
unique method of attaching a copper base to a ceramic form, holding it 
together with tension - no glue or solder!  Around this time I had been 
volunteering at a local clay studio which gave me access to a lot of 
great equipment and clay, feeding my passion!  The Story Takes on Twist
The
 copper on the clay body had a very ancient feel to it and one day I 
showed my new body of work to a dear friend who is an Egyptologist.  He 
was very excited about what I was doing and said that I ought to study 
the ceramics of the Ancient Near East.  I went straight the library and 
felt like I had found a time and people that were kindred spirits as the
 work I saw was just like mine!!!  But not quite as  the clay that was 
used in the BC was fired at a much lower temperature and glaze had not 
been invented yet.  Near Eastern ceramics had a much more organic feel 
that was really inspiring. I went to the studio I was working in and 
announced that I wanted to create forms that were inspired by the work 
of the Ancient Near East; I wanted to be a B.C. Potter! My announcement 
was responded with by a wall of resistance. :(  .  Most ceramic artist 
had little knowledge of the work of the Near East and were not open to 
aiding me on my quest to create the clay forms using a more ancient 
language.  Undeterred, I continued to experiment and work in the studio 
hoping that I could find a happy medium using their required materials 
but trying top create a BC feel. Soon however it became apparent that I 
could not use the High fired clay to make a form satisfactory for what I
 envisioned.  I felt like a B.C. boy trapped in an A.D. world!  Never give UP!!!Through
 the encouragement of friends, I did lots of research finding the exact 
forms I wanted to make, along with the clays that would be appropriate 
to make a chalice that had a real B.C. feel. Armed with this research  I
 hit the streets and asked every potter and public clay studio I could 
find about using their  kilns - I might as well have been carrying a 
skunk!!!  No one wished to open there kiln to me - the work was just too
 far outside of the norm. I wanted to make low fired forms made of red 
and black clays which would look so nice next to the copper, clay bodies
 that were unglazed having the BC look that I am so called to create! It
 was starting to feel like a novel that was doomed to be never be 
published.  Exhausted I shelved the idea for a few years. Good ideas die
 hard I guess because soon my home and computer became so full of books 
and images of work that inspired me, it was all I would talk about.  The
 BC was banging on my creative door and I was either going to honor this
 dream or have to kill it!  Prayer is Answered!
One
 day after poring over a book on the Ceramics of the Sudan and spending 
the afternoon sketching, I was overcome with grief!  How long can I 
continue to carry this creative baby?  Exhausted I began to pray - I 
asked my Higher Power for guidance, and instantly received a very clear 
message over and over: HONOR YOUR DREAM. MAKE YOUR OWN STUDIO! How could
 I ever afford that?!?!?! I went to my office and checked my email; 
finding an email from one of the clay studios I worked in: kiln for 
sale. Without fear I called the number listed.  That is when the 
Universe introduced me to Sarah, a ceramic sculptor of 40 years who was 
not just selling a kiln but an entire clay studio!  Oh and she wanted to
 know if I would like her low fired BLACK CLAY! PRAYER ANSWERED!!!!What I Need & What You Get
One amazing clay kiln, shelves, glazes, tables, clay, tools, turn table for hand building, how-to books: $1,000
Electric hook up fee: $750
Shipping and Handling: In order to ship all the artwork out that 
you buy, I'll need at least $350 (ceramic work is heavy and won't be 
cheap to ship). 
$200 to purchase the rest of my clay needs to set me up for at least 6 months.
$100 to compensate my dear friend whose computer help allowed this to go live!

Indiegogo takes 4% of what I raise, and other transaction fees take 
another 4%, so for this subtraction I want to allow for an extra $184.
Total: 2584
Rewards:Look to the right for the full list of rewards! All original pieces made by me. Note that the ceramics shown below are examples of the type of vessel 
or token available.  You will receive a unique version of that type :D

<p>HI! I'm Casey. It's very nice to meet you...a little about me? Well, I'm a jewelry artist/metalsmith, mountain biker, freelance writer, adventure seeker and community gatherer.  I'm originally from good 'ol Nebraska but currently I'm an angeleno transplant. <br/></p>
<p> Case of the Nomads is a year long US tour to connect communities. The tour will start this summer and I will be traveling to different cities/towns that are involved in (but not limited to) bikes, art and writing. I will be connecting with others and getting involved, hands on. By keeping a blog post about my adventures, travels and communities I'll be able to connect and share with others around the world. Community is the heart and soul of this project. I feel it's how we learn, support each other and thrive. </p>
<p><b>""Tell me and I forget, Teach me and I remember, Involve me and I learn."" </b></p>
<p>It's important that I support myself while I'm on the road. I plan to write, teach jewelry workshops and have jewelry trunk shows along my route. The fall back plan is to rely on my bartending skills, nothing like working your way across the US one classic cocktail at a time. </p>

Case Of The Nomads : Roaming to Unite Radness 
HI! I'm Casey. It's very nice to meet you...a little about me? Well, I'm a jewelry artist/metalsmith, mountain biker, freelance writer, adventure seeker and community gatherer.  I'm originally from good 'ol Nebraska but currently I'm an angeleno transplant. 
 Case of the Nomads is a year long US tour to connect communities. The tour will start this summer and I will be traveling to different cities/towns that are involved in (but not limited to) bikes, art and writing. I will be connecting with others and getting involved, hands on. By keeping a blog post about my adventures, travels and communities I'll be able to connect and share with others around the world. Community is the heart and soul of this project. I feel it's how we learn, support each other and thrive. 
""Tell me and I forget, Teach me and I remember, Involve me and I learn."" 
It's important that I support myself while I'm on the road. I plan to write, teach jewelry workshops and have jewelry trunk shows along my route. The fall back plan is to rely on my bartending skills, nothing like working your way across the US one classic cocktail at a time. 
Give Back:
Volunteering



My give back to these amazing communities is volunteering. If you look at my list of stops the ones I will be volunteering will be marks. 
Community Exchange
Are you connected with a craft community? What are your ideas on how to better connect your current community? How has your community influenced your work? Your career? Your life?  Let's sit and have a round table discussion. I want to give you my insight. And I'd love to hear yours.There is no fee for the exchange and will take place at the following stops, for now.

Where does the money go?? 

I will be converting a trailer into a live/work space while on the road. I will tow it  behind my car (Scion xB). It needs to be light weight, 1200 lbs or less, and as environmentally friendly as possible. Here's a break down of some of the initial costs:

-Renovation of trailer into live/work space ($1000-$2000)
-Other initial expenses: trailer reg, material fees, gas, food, etc. ($1000-$2000)
Ideal trailer is a used Scamp 13ft travel trailer USA made in Minnesota

</ul></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Metodo</strong></p><p>Il bambino viene accompagnato nell’ascolto grazie a un metodo che segue precise direttive approvate dai pediatri. Gli strumenti principali che utilizziamo nelle nostre sequenze musicali sono ” a prova di bambino”, cioè fanno leva sulla sollecitazione di alcune abilità che il bambino é chiamato a mettere in gioco, grazie alla reazione dell’ascolto diretto.</p><p>Contemporaneamente il bambino é accompagnato dall’adulto a compiere semplici gesti facili e ripetitivi che gli permettono di creare nuove associazioni mentali e aiutano il coordinamento e la consapevolezza del proprio corpo.</p><p>In particolare, il nostro metodo si fonda su alcuni utili e basilari strumenti:</p><ul>
<li>La <strong>lallazione</strong>: consiste nella creazione di un linguaggio sonoro a partire da sillabe che vengono intonate su particolari melodie, facilmente memorizzabili e espressive.</li>
<li>
<strong>l’imitazione</strong>: il bambino, ascoltando, si sente coinvolto emotivamente ed è portato a riprodurre con un suo personale alfabeto sonoro quello che ha interiorizzato.</li>
<li>Uguali o diversi? La<strong> ripetizione e la variazione</strong>: l’adulto è chiamato a associare a determinati suoni dei precisi movimenti del corpo (o del viso) che il bambino, curioso, cercherà di riprodurre a suo modo. La ripetizione di questi gesti, insieme a graduali variazioni, permetterà al bambino e all’adulto un’interazione tutta nuova, apprendendo allo stesso tempo, i concetti base della musica.</li>
<li>Tieni il tempo!<strong>il ritmo</strong>: insieme alle melodie, il cd propone chiari esempi di sequenze ritmiche. Lo sviluppo del senso del ritmo permette al bambino di accrescere qualità come la coordinazione e la consapevolezza di sé.</li>
<li>SSSht!..<strong>il silenzio</strong>: grazie all’alternanza di musica e silenzi, si apre lo spazio per il bambino per esternare le prime e immediate reazioni che nascono dall’ascolto e dal contatto con l’adulto che lo guida.</li>

The repetition and variation: the adult is called to associate with certain sounds of the precise movements of the body (and for total) that the child, curious, will try to reproduce in his own way. The repetition of these gestures, along with gradual changes, allow the child and the adult interaction whole new, learning at the same time, the basic concepts of music.
Hold time!the pace: along with the melodies, the cd offers clear examples of rhythmic sequences. The development of the sense of rhythm allows the child to improve quality as the coordination and self-awareness.
SSSht!..silence: the alternation of music and silence, opens space for the child to externalize the first and immediate reactions that arise from listening and from contact with the adult who guides him.
 GoalsThese funds will be used to make use of the following professional:– composer, voices, for the music album;– developer, to create the app Takabum in the three main store (Ios, Android, Windows Phone);– educationalist, for the production of the content and the search of the phonemes;– designer, for the graphics and presentation of the pamphlet;– blogs, for the management of social;– printer, for making paper limited edition.TAKABUM. Perchè la musicaLa musica é un’importante componente per la crescita completa e organica dell’individuo.Studiare musica sin da piccolo permette al bambino di sviluppare le sue potenzialità comunicative e creative al meglio e, divertendosi, di assimilare in breve tempo un metodo che lo aiuterà a superare le difficoltà legate alla concentrazione e allo studio.La musica, attraverso il gioco, dona al bambino gli strumenti per entrare in relazione con l’ambiente e le persone che lo circondano.Fare musica insieme crea un nuovo spazio di condivisione in famiglia : l’adulto, con il bambino, si mette in gioco e insieme sperimentano le infinite possibilità che la voce e i suoni (anche solo di piccoli oggetti) offrono.La musica rafforza i legami e dà un colore tutto nuovo al tempo passato insieme.La musica aiuta il bambino:
a sviluppare le potenzialità dell’udito
a imparare l’ascolto di se stesso e degli altri
nell’attenzione e nella concentrazione
a esprimersi con il proprio corpo
dando strumenti per liberare l’immaginazione e la creatività, sviluppa la propria immaginazione e creatività
 MetodoIl bambino viene accompagnato nell’ascolto grazie a un metodo che segue precise direttive approvate dai pediatri. Gli strumenti principali che utilizziamo nelle nostre sequenze musicali sono ” a prova di bambino”, cioè fanno leva sulla sollecitazione di alcune abilità che il bambino é chiamato a mettere in gioco, grazie alla reazione dell’ascolto diretto.Contemporaneamente il bambino é accompagnato dall’adulto a compiere semplici gesti facili e ripetitivi che gli permettono di creare nuove associazioni mentali e aiutano il coordinamento e la consapevolezza del proprio corpo.In particolare, il nostro metodo si fonda su alcuni utili e basilari strumenti:
La lallazione: consiste nella creazione di un linguaggio sonoro a partire da sillabe che vengono intonate su particolari melodie, facilmente memorizzabili e espressive.

l’imitazione: il bambino, ascoltando, si sente coinvolto emotivamente ed è portato a riprodurre con un suo personale alfabeto sonoro quello che ha interiorizzato.
Uguali o diversi? La ripetizione e la variazione: l’adulto è chiamato a associare a determinati suoni dei precisi movimenti del corpo (o del viso) che il bambino, curioso, cercherà di riprodurre a suo modo. La ripetizione di questi gesti, insieme a graduali variazioni, permetterà al bambino e all’adulto un’interazione tutta nuova, apprendendo allo stesso tempo, i concetti base della musica.
Tieni il tempo!il ritmo: insieme alle melodie, il cd propone chiari esempi di sequenze ritmiche. Lo sviluppo del senso del ritmo permette al bambino di accrescere qualità come la coordinazione e la consapevolezza di sé.
SSSht!..il silenzio: grazie all’alternanza di musica e silenzi, si apre lo spazio per il bambino per esternare le prime e immediate reazioni che nascono dall’ascolto e dal contatto con l’adulto che lo guida.
 ObiettiviQuesti fondi verranno usati per avvalerci delle seguenti professionalità:– compositore, voci, per le musiche dell’album;– sviluppatore, per creare l’app Takabum nei tre principali store (Ios, Android, Windows Phone);– pedagogista, per la produzione dei contenuti e la ricerca dei fonemi;– disegnatore, per le grafiche e il pamphlet di presentazione;– blogger, per la gestione dei social;– stampatore, per la realizzazione cartacea dell’edizione limitata.TAKABUM.Parce que la musiqueLa musique est un élément important pour la croissance intégrale de la personne et biologique.Étudier la musique depuis l'enfance permet à l'enfant de développer son potentiel créatif et communicatif au mieux, et, amusement, à assimiler en peu de temps une méthode qui va l'aider à surmonter les difficultés liées à la concentration et la musique studio.La, par le jeu, donne à l'enfant les outils pour entrer en relation avec l'environnement et les gens autour de lui.Faire de la musique ensemble crée un nouvel espace partagé dans la famille : l'adulte, avec l'enfant, entre dans le jeu et, ensemble, ils éprouvent les possibilités infinies que la voix et les sons (même de petits objets) offre.La musique renforce les liens et donne une toute nouvelle couleur pour le temps passé ensemble.La musique aide l'enfant:
de développer le potentiel de l'audition
à apprendre l'écoute de soi et des autres
de l'attention et la concentration
de se exprimer avec leur corps
donnant des outils pour libérer l'imagination et la créativité, développer leur imagination et la créativité
MéthodeL'enfant est accompagné par l'écoute grâce à une méthode qui suit des directives strictes approuvées par les pédiatres. Les principaux outils que nous utilisons dans nos séquences musicales sont ""l'épreuve des enfants"", qui exploitent la sollicitation de certaines compétences que l'enfant est appelé à participation, grâce à la réaction directe de l'écoute.Dans le même temps l'enfant est accompagné par l'adulte pour effectuer des gestes simples facile et répétitif qui lui permettent de créer de nouvelles associations mentales et la coordination de l'aide et la conscience du corps.En particulier, notre méthode est basée sur quelques outils de base et utiles:
Le babillage: est la création d'un langage sonore de syllabes qui sont à l'écoute des airs particuliers, facile à retenir et expressif.

imitation: l'enfant, écoute, se sent émotionnellement impliqué et est amené à jouer avec son propre son alphabet personnels qui ont intériorisé.
Identiques ou différents,? Le répétition et la variation: l'adulte est appelé à se associer avec certains sons des mouvements précis du corps (et pour le total) que l'enfant, curieux, va essayer de reproduire à sa manière. La répétition de ces gestes, ainsi que des changements graduels, permettre à l'enfant et de l'interaction des adultes tout nouveau, apprendre en même temps, les concepts de base de la musique.
Temps de maintien!le rythme: avec les mélodies, le cd propose des exemples clairs de séquences rythmiques. Le développement du sens du rythme permet à l'enfant d'améliorer la qualité que de la coordination et de la conscience de soi.
SSSht!..silence: l'alternance de la musique et le silence, ouvre un espace pour l'enfant à externaliser les premières réactions et immédiats qui résultent de l'écoute et du contact avec l'adulte qui le guide.
ObjectifsCes fonds seront utilisés pour faire usage de la professionnelle suivante:– compositeur, voix, pour l'album de musique;– promoteur, pour créer l'application Takabum dans les trois magasin principal (Ios, Androïde, Windows Phone);– éducateur, pour la production du contenu et de la recherche de phonèmes;– designer, pour les graphiques et la présentation de la brochure;– blogs, pour la gestion de sociale;– imprimeur, pour fabriquer du papier édition limitée.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Aussi face au risque de fermeture, le

<p>Il est enfin d'offrir aux investisseurs une opportunité originale en leur fournissant
comme support des produits permettant la transformation d’un hôtel 3* en une
résidence de distinction gérée par des professionnels expérimentés de l'hôtellerie.
Mais dans ce cadre, ce n'est pas seulement un investissement, c'est un mode de

Martinique, et assurer la transmission du savoir-faire français et caraïbes. Il
s’agit de combler les nombreux emplois qui restent non-pourvus dans le secteur difficile
de la restauration. La recette est d’utiliser le temps disponible pendant la
basse saison en réalisant 5 sessions de 8 à 10 personnes composées d’une
formation gratuite de 8 semaines, suivie de 4 semaines de stage.</p>
<p>Des manifestations telles que déjeuners et dîners de gala seront organisés à

<p>Votre contribution nous donnera les moyens de faire une campagne pour
restaurer l’hôtel grâce à la participation des artistes et designers de la

l’invitation à un dîner privé à l’hôtel en présence des artistes et à la visite
privilégiée des chambres décorées par les artistes), le montant retomberait aux
alentours de 850€ après déduction fiscale. Cette offre est donc une vraie <i>incentive</i> supplémentaire pour aider le

<p>Nous préparons une
saison exceptionnelle de soirées privées  « <i>show case</i> » dans les salons fermés, en plein air ou sur la plage de l’hôtel vous permettant de découvrir de manière
privilégiée une sélection d’artistes de blues et de jazz  invités aux différents festivals de la

est une véritable ouverture sur le monde de l’Art et de la musique des caraïbes.
En offrant des avantages particuliers de type accès VIP selon certaines
conditions aux membres du Club Art Project, l’idée est de tisser une relation
durable avec nos clients. C’est aussi de conserver le plus longtemps possible

ensemble en s’appuyant sur les échanges et l’évènementiel que l’hôtel Club 3

<p><b>Le défi à relever !</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>De nombreux clients et amoureux de l’hôtel Club 3 îlets se sont mobilisés à
travers une pétition pour dire non à la fermeture de cet établissement, et nous
en sommes reconnaissants. Les signataires de la pétition sont d’ores et déjà
enregistrés comme premiers membres d’honneur du Club Art Project.  Ils bénéficient  d’un accès VIP à toutes les manifestations de
l’hôtel et le management leur offre un séjour de 5 jours gratuit sur la saison
2016 (janvier à mars). En contrepartie, nous attendons que chacun fasse
prospérer la campagne de financement participatif en diffusant nos informations
au plus grand nombre. La diffusion efficace permettra éventuellement de
mobiliser des investisseurs institutionnels.</p>
<p>En effet, la société Hôtel Club 3 îlets
est une entreprise en difficulté qui ne peut pas bénéficier de financement
bancaire. Les actionnaires ont déjà beaucoup investis et ne pourront remettre
plus d’1.000.000 €. Pour aider l’entreprise et lui permettre d’avoir un avenir

supporteurs de notre hôtel et à nos premiers «visiteurs de l’Art » des séjours et des produits dérivés à des
tarifs exceptionnels. 
Devenez membre du Club Art Project !
L’hôtel souhaite réunir ses fidèles clients et supporteurs dans une
structure ad hoc   - le Club Art Project - qui
est une véritable ouverture sur le monde de l’Art et de la musique des caraïbes.
En offrant des avantages particuliers de type accès VIP selon certaines
conditions aux membres du Club Art Project, l’idée est de tisser une relation
durable avec nos clients. C’est aussi de conserver le plus longtemps possible
l’authenticité du quartier de l’Anse à l’Âne ainsi que la qualité du vivre
ensemble en s’appuyant sur les échanges et l’évènementiel que l’hôtel Club 3
îlets va entreprendre.

Le défi à relever !

De nombreux clients et amoureux de l’hôtel Club 3 îlets se sont mobilisés à
travers une pétition pour dire non à la fermeture de cet établissement, et nous
en sommes reconnaissants. Les signataires de la pétition sont d’ores et déjà
enregistrés comme premiers membres d’honneur du Club Art Project.  Ils bénéficient  d’un accès VIP à toutes les manifestations de
l’hôtel et le management leur offre un séjour de 5 jours gratuit sur la saison
2016 (janvier à mars). En contrepartie, nous attendons que chacun fasse
prospérer la campagne de financement participatif en diffusant nos informations
au plus grand nombre. La diffusion efficace permettra éventuellement de
mobiliser des investisseurs institutionnels.
En effet, la société Hôtel Club 3 îlets
est une entreprise en difficulté qui ne peut pas bénéficier de financement
bancaire. Les actionnaires ont déjà beaucoup investis et ne pourront remettre
plus d’1.000.000 €. Pour aider l’entreprise et lui permettre d’avoir un avenir
durable grâce à un projet le repositionnant 
sur une voie plus viable, la campagne compte déjà sur un parrainage et un soutien exceptionnel  des acteurs de l’Art et de la Musique
et du Tourisme. Elle doit aussi rassembler au moins 1.130.000 € pour la
réussite du projet. 
Le délai de souscription prévu est du 28
Août 2015 au 23 septembre 2015.Tout souscripteur ou participant devient membre
de plein droit du Club Art Project.
Les sommes seront versées sur compte séquestre et
conservées jusqu’à la notification du jugement de la Cour d’Appel prévue le 29
septembre. Si, à cette date, la période de redressement est converti en
liquidation  les sommes seront restituées
aux souscripteurs. Si la décision est favorable à la poursuite d’exploitation,
une « Newsletter » vous
tiendra régulièrement informé de l’opération « sauvetage », du suivi des
travaux et des conditions de la relance de l’établissement ainsi que du
programme des évènements de la prochaine saison.

<h3>The Magic Bus Tour</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hello, we are A-peg. An organisation exploring audience participation through experimentation and games. We are looking to raise enough money to fund artist materials for the Magic Bus tour. We've asked five artists to make work in unexplored pastures, and they've accepted.</p>
<p></p>On the 17th November, Sunday afternoon, the Magic Bus tour begins 12pm Midday. We are travelling via double decker 1960s  Green Bus, with 60 passengers. The tour will travel through South Bristol from Clifton towards Chew Valley Lake and back. Throughout the journey will be several stops in the countryside to visit work by Artists: Hannah Sullivan, Shaun Badham, Alice Duck, Joe Deighan and Vickie Fear. A-peg will be providing lunch and refreshments, as well as some artisan commentary. It is a jam-packed afternoon of merriment, art and culture all set against the beautiful Bristol greenery. <p></p>
<p>With your contributions you will be supporting local emerging artists, showcased in an original performative journey. An experience we would love to share with you!<br/></p>
<p><b>What we need &amp; what you get</b></p>
<p>We are looking for 1,000 to make sure we can provide the artists with materials and production costs and if all succeeds some money for their work. We also need to fund the bus. We are offering tickets for £13 each Link: <a href=""https://a-pegmagicbus.eventbrite.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://a-pegmagicbus.eventbrite.co.uk/</a> with lunch provided, but this will only cover hiring the bus and driver. So to secure our artists we are looking for your help.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the target we will put any money towards artist materials, but the more the better to produce the best we can.</p>
<p>To give you something for your support we have rewards including: personalised pegs, photos of the journey and artworks, and an Italian dinner party with A-peg (cooked by a real Italian woman!).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>If you love art and would feel good about promoting young talent, this is the project to support us on. We've got a track record of giving people a good time, and working collaboratively on projects. This project will have a positive resounding effect on both the artists and the audience, providing a new experience for a large group of people which we hope will filter onto many more things to come.     </span></span></span></div>","The Magic Bus Tour

<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>After 60 glamorous years entertaining guests on the Las
Vegas strip, the Riviera Hotel Casino closed it’s doors forever on May 4th,
2015. The Riv was the first high rise on the strip, signaling a departure from
the motor courts that previously welcomed travelers.  The haunts of the Rat Pack have steadily disappeared
over the years and the Riviera held on as long as she could. The resort that
famously hosted entertainers Liberace, Frank Sinatra and countless others as
well as film productions such as Ocean’s Eleven, The Hangover and Casino will
soon become another ghost of Fabulous Las Vegas. </p>
<p>In order to keep up with fierce competition from other cities,
the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) purchased the property to
expand their convention capacity and to have a presence on the Las Vegas strip.
The closing of the Riviera struck a raw nerve with many who miss the pre-corporate
Sin City. Passionate petition drives to save the resort appear to have fallen a
bit short. The Riviera will be imploded as early as this summer.</p>
<p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p>We cannot save the structures but we can save the most
identifiable architectural elements, the neon signs. For the last year we have
been working with the LVCVA to arrange for the preservation of two very
important signs before the buildings are demolished. With final agreement, we
now have the monumental task of removing the signs safely. The funds collected
will pay for a bonded, union sign company to remove the iconic red script sign
on Las Vegas Boulevard and the bulb and neon sign on the corner of Las Vegas
Blvd. and Riviera Blvd (Both featured in photos). Once safely removed, the
signs will require trucks for transportation and storage. The signs are massive
and we will need to have a crane and bucket truck with crews to properly
preserve them. If we are unable to raise adequate funding there is a strong
possibility that one or both signs will be destroyed during the demolition!
Classic neon signs are disappearing rapidly, the time to preserve them is now. </p>
<p>The Riviera signs will be safely stored until they are
installed in a major exhibition that celebrates Nevada’s neon heritage
currently under development. </p>
<p><b>Project Costs</b></p>
<p>Sign Company- Time and Materials full day with crew, crane
and bucket truck -$2,800</p>
<p>Lane Closure Permitting- $200</p>
<p>Transportation- $800</p>
<p>Total- $3,800</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>For the last 20 years we have been preserving the disappearing
neon signage that glorified the Silver State through much of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. The collection represents the entire state of Nevada from Elko and
Reno to Carson City and Las Vegas. The preserved signs come from properties
such as: Sahara Las Vegas, Flamingo Las Vegas, Harolds Club Reno, Brandin Iron
Elko and scores more. Will Durham, who will oversee this project, has
personally preserved more Nevada Neon signs than anyone else in the state. We
have extensive experience preserving these historical gems and we will show the
Riviera signs all due care and respect.</p>
<p>The signs we have preserved have been exhibited at venues
such as: Museum of Neon Art, The Neon Museum, University of Nevada Reno,
Western Folklife Center in Elko and were the feature exhibition in 2012-13 at
the Nevada Museum of Art. We are currently developing a major neon project to
help permanently honor the art and craft that helped forge Nevada’s maverick
image.</p>
<p><b>We Ask for your
Assistance</b></p>
<p>People often lament the loss of iconic structures and the
neon signs that represent them without knowing how to get involved. Preservation
is very difficult and expensive work. This is an opportunity to participate in
a high profile preservation project of an iconic Las Vegas legend. Please help
us hang onto a piece of the Riviera magic. Thank you so much for your
participation in this exciting preservation project!</p>

    The Impact  My current work deals heavily with the integration of living beings as well as the duality of natural and synthetic forms. This residency will allow me to further explore my work and expand my understanding of organic life in relation to new media. http://www.adrianerivera.com/
I will be able to experiment with new ways to examine and capture organisms in their natural environment as well as a controlled laboratory.
I will make use of practices such as 3D Scanning/modeling/printing and sound based deformation to create new work sourced from the residency.



Other Ways You Can Help
 The deadline for the residency is fast approaching, and I will need your help spreading this campaign as quickly as possible!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>Short
Summary </b></p>
<p><i>Two for the Road: Adventures in
Maine</i> is a travel book that takes a
loving look at some of the less-publicized aspects of life in the Pine Tree
State. Our goal: to raise $2200 to print a limited run of 250 copies.</p>
<p>Over the last fifteen years, Heidi
Killion and I have traveled in the South and Southwest, documenting our
experiences in print and on film. After covering so many miles “away” we
decided to investigate the small towns and rural routes of our home state,
Maine. Our editor at the time, Sam Pfeifle of the <i><a href=""http://portland.thephoenix.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Portland
Phoenix</span></a></i>, gave us carte blanche to explore the gritty, weird, and
often humorous side of Vacationland: we visited the drag races in Oxford and a
hunting camp in St. Albans. We stopped to chat with fishermen playing
horseshoes near Winter Harbor, and drove five hours north to New Sweden for
Midsommar. </p>
<p>In 2013, we decided to compile the
essays and photos from our travels into a book. <i>Two for the Road: Adventures
in Maine</i> is the result. You won’t see photos of lighthouses or get advice
about where to find the best lobster roll here. We love lighthouses and lobster
rolls, but there is so much more to Maine! We made it a priority to go places
and have experiences—right here at home—that pushed us beyond the comfortable
and familiar. </p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We’re hoping to raise $2200 to cover
the cost of printing 250 copies of <i>Two for the Road: Adventures in Maine</i>.
All funds raised (minus Indiegogo’s nominal fee) will go toward production
costs. We will be donating 20% of any profits from the book's sale to the <a href=""http://www.mainewomensfund.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Maine Women’s
Fund</span></a>. </p>
<p>What’s in it for you? All donors
will receive a deluxe thank you postcard with an image from the book.
Contributions in any amount will help support women in the arts, advance the
cause of venturesome ladies (why should guys get to have all the fun?), and
bring a book into the world that celebrates Maine in all its whacky glory. </p>

For years, I have dedicated thousands of dollars and hours into keeping the arts vibrant in my under-served community. I love what I do. This is what I live for.
The Roots Art Connection is an organization that promotes youth and community involvement in Creative Arts and Culture while simultaneously increasing awareness, literacy, creativity, and improving the wellness of life for all. Growing up I didn't have access to such enrichment due to social and economic injustices and barriers. Today, many youth and adults still have the same struggle. I know art has the power to change lives and everyone should have the benefit of experiencing that. Your contribution will help eliminate oppression in the art community. More youth and adults will have access to art shows, poetry events and program services. This space will allow artists who can't afford studio space to have somewhere to create their original work. This space will be a place for poets, youth and artists of all forms to commune. Resources is all we need to create such a home for the arts. Every $1 makes a difference in our progress. 
   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail: 
We are seeking to raise $5,000 through crowd funding. Our total project cost is $20,000. $6,600 of that is our rent expense for 12 months. Other expenses include supplies ($2,800), furniture(1,250) and contract/consultants($9,350). Crowd Funding will cover rent and furniture for our space. Our gallery space will be a very eclectic place. The walls be orange, red, yellow and blue as well as the furniture. The space will be open daily for artist to come create art and you are welcome to come by at anytime. If we don't reach our entire goal, funds we do raise will go directly towards our rent expense. 
  The Impact 
The Roots Art Connection currently has two programs in operation that benefit the youth of Central Arkansas: Poetry Saves Lives and The Roots Theatre Project. Both programs are presently offered to youth ages 10-24. 
The Roots Art Connection frequently holds events for adult poets and artists to showcase their talents to appreciative audiences. The Roots Art Connection -Gallery/Youth Hub/Studio will guarantee such programs and events are consistently continued. Once the venue has opened weekly poetry readings, workshops, art shows and more eclectic events will be held throughout the year.
Central Arkansas has yet to have a venue of this caliber that is abundantly focused solely on creative arts in the community.

Guests will get to know one another while having the opportunity to ask questions about and respond to the work as it is created.Because one goal of Make/Dinner is to bring neighbors together, we want to eliminate any barriers to participation -- there's no cost to attend. For that reason, we need your support. Your contributions will help to pay for the meal, the materials to create the artist's work, transportation, and a fee for the artist. Because this is a hyper-local event, your donations go straight toward community businesses, artists, and goods. GroceriesHere's what it takes to bring a Make/Dinner event to life...$400 - Artist fee $200 - Cost of food and drink$400 - Artist materials and supplies$50 - Transportation $160 - Project administration$30 - design and printing of flyers and menusTotal: $1240All of our donors will be recognized at the meal on our dinner menu, as well as online.Why works in progress? As a society, we still put a lot of stock in the myth of the solo artist: the sculptor or writer laboring alone, the genius implementing their ideas. But by opening up the seams of an artist’s work while it’s still in development, we believe audiences can have a window into the ways that all artists collaborate, whether by collecting ideas and feedback from others, weaving their major influences into their project, or placing their work in conversation with another piece. Why a dinner party? When we eat together, we become human: we encounter one another's traditions, taboos, delights, dislikes, and loves. When we prepare food together, these elements are thrown into even sharper relief -- the sensory feast of fresh ingredients on their way to becoming a meal can bring even strangers close. Creating a work of art is an intimate act, and we hope that by observing the small intimacies implicit in pouring someone a glass of water, passing them a plate, or choosing the tomato they'll slice into a salad, participants can also channel the artist's relationship to the work.Can’t donate today?You can still enter the lottery to attend at no cost!Spread the word! Make/Dinner is a new type of project, and so we need advocates like you to share why this is a unique idea. You have the ability to share details about Make/Dinner directly from Indiegogo!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Project Background</h3>
<p>Since 2013, thanks to thousands of individual donors, several corporate sponsors, and the incredible generosity of The Walt Disney Company, The Walt Disney Birthplace has been completely transformed. Six years ago in 2013, it looked almost nothing like the worker's cottage designed and built by Flora and Elias Disney, Walt's parents, in 1893. Today, the home once again looks like the humble dwelling pictured in its earliest known photo.</p>
<p>But it is not ready to open to the general public. </p>

<p>The interior Window Sponsor plaques and the dedicated Fence Slat plaques have been installed, and the next round of dedicated Paver Stones will be completed before Winter freezes the ground again this year. As always, we are enormously grateful to everyone who so graciously donated to the project; the home looks as beautiful as it does because of YOU!</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<h3>A Fantastic Limited Opportunity To Get Your Name <u>Inside</u> The Home!</h3>
<p>To celebrate this year's <strong>D23 Expo — </strong>and D23's recent visit to the Birthplace and the local Hermosa community — we are running this ""Friends Of The Birthplace"" campaign!</p>
<p>You can <strong>add your name to the inside of the Birthplace by contributing at this time</strong>! For only 23 days, we are offering the chance to support the project with a $200.00 pledge. For every donor who contributes, we will add their names to a donor plaque, similar to the Fence Slat plaques, to be placed on a framed panel inside the home! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Opening the home for regularly scheduled group tours will still require significant expenditures. Along with completing the immersive guest experience, an offsite visitor's center with parking will need to be developed, as well as transportation trolleys to and from the Birthplace.

<p>Makers’ Mill, the North Adams makerspace, is a space for creative collaboration to foster new learning opportunities and build a community around a shared passion for making. Located in downtown North Adams, Massachusetts, Makers’ Mill is a creative resource for the local community that allows people to work and learn alongside one another. It cultivates an environment ripe for experimentation in new media and processes, boosting economic and creative vitality in our region by empowering people to MAKE!</p>

<p>Makers’ Mill is starting with shared resources to support printmaking and fiber arts with expansion plans to include other disciplines. Printmaking equipment will include screen printing, relief printing presses, and, if we reach our funding goals, an etching press.

We met at the <a href=""http://artpractice.sva.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">School of Visual Arts MFA in Art Practice program.</a> We joined forces because we wanted to present our artistic research to a broad audience in NYC this coming summer. By working together we think that we can be 4 times more efficient and spread our ideas 4 times further than we could working on our own.</p><p>We’ve found an exhibition space that we love in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Because this prime location is expensive to rent, we’re asking for the support of our community to help offset our investment.</p><p>As artists of the Baroque Power Group we aren’t unified by a particular style or medium, but by shared values and interests: that nature is not separate from humanity; that individual experience is diverse and dignified; and that consciousness is a gift.</p><p>We called our team the Baroque Power Group because we are inspired by the ideas of 17th Century Spanish-Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Contrary to the Western dualisms of human vs. nature, good vs. evil, self vs. Other, Spinoza believed that all things partake of one substance.</p><p>The 4 exhibitions we present in July will be free and open to the public. We can’t wait to see you at our shows! However you choose to participate, we hope that you join us in the ongoing conversations proposed by our art.</p><p>We are honored and delighted to receive your financial support, friendship and engagement. </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are working to raise $5,000 to offset our investment in renting a street-level gallery space at <a href=""http://www.parasolprojects.com/lower-east-side-gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2 Rivington</a> for the month of July. Each member of the Baroque Power Group will show work for 1 week out of the month. Our total cost for renting this space is $11,000. This does not include the cost for the materials, technology and labor that goes into the creation of our art.</p><p>We have collectively made this investment in exhibition space because we want to bring our artwork to the widest, most engaged audience possible. By locating our shows in one of NYC’s most vibrant art districts (1 block from the New Museum and in a neighborhood filled with world-class contemporary art galleries) we are making our exhibitions accessible to friends, colleagues, teachers, critics and collectors.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431376084/zvm3enesfmtkgdxmabtz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>(The space at 2 Rivington.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact of Our Work</span><br/>
</h3><p></p><h4><b><i>“The art world isn’t a market, it’s a conversation.”</i></b></h4><p><b>                                              -- David A. Ross, Chair, SVA MFA in Art Practice</b> </p><p>We believe that art is a kind of laboratory and archive of what it means to be alive in our particular time and place. In his or her own way, each member of the Baroque Power Group uses art as a means to investigate and participate in the disparate community that is life on earth in the first part of the 21st Century.</p><p>We have all experienced how art can bring us joy, make us angry and put us in touch with both beauty and suffering. Often, art combines all these elements, helping us to make meaning out of the mixed experience of existence. We believe that art asks questions and makes unexpected connections. Art is the field where we think, act and make, all at once.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Being an artist comes with no guarantees. It is work that we do because we love it and we want to spend our time on this earth doing it. It is possible that we won’t make money on this work, and that it will not be well-received. </p><p>This campaign is not only about raising funds for our summer exhibitions but also about building a community of supporters who want to engage with our ideas and the artistic productions that we use to inhabit those ideas. </p><p>As artists, we are self-starters, self-organized and used to making few resources go a long way. We have worked hard, juggled responsibilities of graduate school, work and life to bring you our summer exhibitions. We guarantee that your financial support will be put to good use. </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>All forms of support, financial and otherwise are crucial to our success. If you don’t choose to donate, please help us by getting the word out about our Indiegogo campaign and our artwork. </p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><ul>

We met at the School of Visual Arts MFA in Art Practice program. We joined forces because we wanted to present our artistic research to a broad audience in NYC this coming summer. By working together we think that we can be 4 times more efficient and spread our ideas 4 times further than we could working on our own.We’ve found an exhibition space that we love in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Because this prime location is expensive to rent, we’re asking for the support of our community to help offset our investment.As artists of the Baroque Power Group we aren’t unified by a particular style or medium, but by shared values and interests: that nature is not separate from humanity; that individual experience is diverse and dignified; and that consciousness is a gift.We called our team the Baroque Power Group because we are inspired by the ideas of 17th Century Spanish-Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Contrary to the Western dualisms of human vs. nature, good vs. evil, self vs. Other, Spinoza believed that all things partake of one substance.The 4 exhibitions we present in July will be free and open to the public. We can’t wait to see you at our shows! However you choose to participate, we hope that you join us in the ongoing conversations proposed by our art.We are honored and delighted to receive your financial support, friendship and engagement. What We Need & What You GetWe are working to raise $5,000 to offset our investment in renting a street-level gallery space at 2 Rivington for the month of July. Each member of the Baroque Power Group will show work for 1 week out of the month. Our total cost for renting this space is $11,000. This does not include the cost for the materials, technology and labor that goes into the creation of our art.We have collectively made this investment in exhibition space because we want to bring our artwork to the widest, most engaged audience possible. By locating our shows in one of NYC’s most vibrant art districts (1 block from the New Museum and in a neighborhood filled with world-class contemporary art galleries) we are making our exhibitions accessible to friends, colleagues, teachers, critics and collectors.(The space at 2 Rivington. Image courtesy of Parasol Projects)As part of this campaign, we offer a variety of artworks (made by us!) in appreciation of your support. This is your chance to claim an original work by a member of the Baroque Power Group. Check out the ""Gifts"" heading below to see the perks we are offering as thanks for your support. This is art history in the making. Be a part of it!
The Impact of Our Work
“The art world isn’t a market, it’s a conversation.”                                              -- David A. Ross, Chair, SVA MFA in Art Practice We believe that art is a kind of laboratory and archive of what it means to be alive in our particular time and place. In his or her own way, each member of the Baroque Power Group uses art as a means to investigate and participate in the disparate community that is life on earth in the first part of the 21st Century.We have all experienced how art can bring us joy, make us angry and put us in touch with both beauty and suffering. Often, art combines all these elements, helping us to make meaning out of the mixed experience of existence. We believe that art asks questions and makes unexpected connections. Art is the field where we think, act and make, all at once.Risks & ChallengesBeing an artist comes with no guarantees. It is work that we do because we love it and we want to spend our time on this earth doing it. It is possible that we won’t make money on this work, and that it will not be well-received. This campaign is not only about raising funds for our summer exhibitions but also about building a community of supporters who want to engage with our ideas and the artistic productions that we use to inhabit those ideas. As artists, we are self-starters, self-organized and used to making few resources go a long way. We have worked hard, juggled responsibilities of graduate school, work and life to bring you our summer exhibitions. We guarantee that your financial support will be put to good use. Other Ways You Can HelpAll forms of support, financial and otherwise are crucial to our success. If you don’t choose to donate, please help us by getting the word out about our Indiegogo campaign and our artwork.

</b></p><p>Over the summer of 2014 while walking home one evening I was interrupted by the distinct vision of an art show featuring dance works. I saw the space, the choreography, the people, the lighting. It was so visceral yet outside myself; I knew I had to take the thought seriously. This vision came to me repeatedly in the following months and I started to delve into the purpose of the show. What was my purpose? What is the show saying? Who is it telling?</p>NATA NATA NADA<p>NATA NATA NADA is a dance video installation piece, exploring what it means to be human - as all art does. It is an intersection of art mediums, the body and video as commentary on our evolution, our beginning and our purest form and how they interact. </p><p>The video focuses on five archetypes and their relationship to each other. As humans, we have many parts of ourselves that we hide, or posturize. During different times in our lives different archetypes surface or battle for attention. There are internal roles we take on as characters, and our external world is quick to give us roles to adapt to, step into, or fight to reject. NATA NATA NADA looks at the archetypes of Mother, Baby, Bully, Hero and Sex Symbol, their interaction, relationship, struggle, and triumph. While these five are taken from a personal place, and are feminine in nature, my hope is to create work that is universal to the human through choreography, while making dance as an art form more accessible. The name is a play on words, NATA having different orgins meaning birth, creator, speaker and dancer and NADA meaning nothing lends to the duality of human nature, or feelings and our actions, OUR EXISTENCE, while also paying tribute to my name Natalia, and the personal journey (Caminata) creating this work has been.</p><p><b>BUDGET AND BENEFITS </b></p><p>-Renting Space for the Show June 13th! (THE SPACE I IMAGINED EXISTS!! A FRIEND PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE WHAT I PICTURED -- PLEASE HELP ME SECURE IT)</p><p>-Filming and Editing </p><p>-Lighting Designer</p><p>-Renting Space to film in</p><p>-Choreography/ Practice Space (I have developed my choreography in open fields, Independence Park, and in my living room furniture pushed aside, as well as a great facility Links Hall, renting to young artists workshopping their pieces in need of space to MOVE for $12/hr. I would love to have the room to continue to practice and clean up before filming)</p><p><i>BENEFITS vary from tickets, post card thank you notes, or a dance class for you and friends taught by me, Natalia, to your name in the credits -----&gt; view right for more details!</i></p><p><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></p><p>Time, SPACE, and funding have been the greatest challenges. </p><p>The greatest risk has just been ego.</p><p>BUT WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY!</p><p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP!!!</b></p><p>If you are not in the position to donate, (no amount is too small though!

</div><p></p></div>","Over the summer of 2014 while walking home one evening I was interrupted by the distinct vision of an art show featuring dance works. I saw the space, the choreography, the people, the lighting. It was so visceral yet outside myself; I knew I had to take the thought seriously. This vision came to me repeatedly in the following months and I started to delve into the purpose of the show. What was my purpose? What is the show saying? Who is it telling?NATA NATA NADANATA NATA NADA is a dance video installation piece, exploring what it means to be human - as all art does. It is an intersection of art mediums, the body and video as commentary on our evolution, our beginning and our purest form and how they interact. The video focuses on five archetypes and their relationship to each other. As humans, we have many parts of ourselves that we hide, or posturize. During different times in our lives different archetypes surface or battle for attention. There are internal roles we take on as characters, and our external world is quick to give us roles to adapt to, step into, or fight to reject. NATA NATA NADA looks at the archetypes of Mother, Baby, Bully, Hero and Sex Symbol, their interaction, relationship, struggle, and triumph. While these five are taken from a personal place, and are feminine in nature, my hope is to create work that is universal to the human through choreography, while making dance as an art form more accessible. The name is a play on words, NATA having different orgins meaning birth, creator, speaker and dancer and NADA meaning nothing lends to the duality of human nature, or feelings and our actions, OUR EXISTENCE, while also paying tribute to my name Natalia, and the personal journey (Caminata) creating this work has been.BUDGET AND BENEFITS -Renting Space for the Show June 13th!

<p>Pinelandia Gallery opened its doors early this spring. We curated three shows in three months to show the need for and possibilities of an art gallery in this region of Mississippi. It was a success! We received only positive feedback. However, we have concluded that we need to expand our offerings and business model in order to continue to grow and pay our overhead. We are working to build and open spaces for other other artists and crafts people to rent for studio or exhibition. We will continue to have the main gallery for art and performance. We also need to work on our little black box theater room to be able to offer drama classes to children.</p>
<p>Your funds will go directly to materials, for we do all of our own construction work. Who are we? Robert and Sloane Cheatham, husband and wife, artists, entrepreneurs, parents, writers and community minded folk. We moved to Mississippi and year and half ago to live a simpler life with our young son and hopefully do good in the world. Please help us make a difference in a real way!</p>
<p>Some of you helped us get started with this project, and we thank you so much. You're a part of a positive ripple effect in an area of our country that needs art and creativity support. We ask for you to spread our request for assistance at this time and help if you can. If we can get this thang really rockin' and rollin' you will receive a t-shirt... one day.</p>
<p>What we are trying is an uphill battle, no doubt. But we are hard workers and feel we have no other choice but to make our best effort at making a positive impact using our creative talents to an area that would not have it otherwise. We feel it is what led us to this point... something greater than ourselves, perhaps.</p>

<p>Support is so important, especially in the performance piece The Last American Indian On Earth.

Projects like this DIE without support. </p>
<p>Supporting by donating here, buying some of my work, or passing this effort to friends or family who are like minded.</p>
<p>Here's the meat:</p>
<h3>My name is Gregg....<strong><br/></strong>
</h3>
<p>I am an artist. An Indigenous artist. From my last Indiegogo project, you might know my efforts to bring the performance piece The Last American Indian On Earth to fruition. I am in the throws of this performance piece in addition to my regular body of work: paintings, installations, site specific works. These works are my voice, my life and love and I have to keep them going. A contribution to my ability to finish the first phase of The Last American Indian On Earth as well as the continued effort of my gallery work not only keeps my work going, but keeps my family going as well. The life of a full time working artist often ebbs and flows, and that is why your contribution is so vastly important. The goals behind The Last American Indian On Earth are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short film (planning to submit to Sundance for 2014)</li>
<li>Prints for Gallery work</li>
<li>Continued performance opportunities</li>
<li>Various short films for online consumption AFTER initial afore mentioned short film</li>
</ul>
<h3>So, what I need is....</h3>
<p>Money to cover small things, which add up. In terms of The Last American Indian On Earth, this cost amounts to various amounts of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>taxis</li>
<li>gas</li>
<li>food</li>
<li>crew support</li>
<li>equipment support</li>
<li>fees for submission and accolades</li>
</ul>
<p>Costs of personal work by Gregg Deal amounts to various amounts of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paint</li>
<li>canvas</li>
<li>wood</li>
<li>other materials (paper, paste, photocopies, stencil materials, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>While all of this is important, The Last American Indian is dire as there are deadlines in place for the short film and it's submision. Nevertheless, the funds all go into the continued production of The Last American Indian On Earth AND the continued production of work for upcoming gallery shows and presentations.</p>
<h3>Why the hell should I give you anything....</h3>
<p>You shouldn't. At least you shouldn't if you don't believe in me or what I am doing. Ultimately this comes down to people supporting me and my work. It's not just about pressing 'like' on Facebook, or ReTweeting an image I posted on the Internet. It's about putting your money where your mouth is. If you appreciate and support, you can throw in a buck. If you really want to make an inpact, you can buy one of my pieces or pass the link onto like minded friends or family to support this important work.</p>
<p>The voice of my work is incredibly important as it speaks with a true voice of an Indigenous person. My work comments on the social aspects of being Indian in the modern day with a tone of humor and irony. In everything I do, be it paintings or performance art, I confront the viewer with imagery that forces consideration and often works as a mirror to the viewer, illustrating their understanding, their thoughts and feelings and willing interaction with Indigenous people, statements, icons, and images. As a Native person, this ist the most important work I have ever done. If you can believe in that and stand behind that, then support me. I am in the middle of shooting The Last American Indian On Earth with photography and video as well as in my studio creating new visual art for future shows later this fall. It's looking pretty epic overall.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>A unique
collaboration between the YMCA of the Triangle and Crosspointe Church will
broaden service to northwest Cary – the fastest growing region in the state.
Crosspointe Church is raising funds to build a 130,000 square foot facility
that will provide expanded space for the church. The YMCA of the Triangle will
lease space to operate a new YMCA. </p>

Works and lives in Montreal (Canada). I develop my artistic research through different mediums: photography, scanning, drawing, and more recently performance. Fragments, pieces : This is my vision of a portraitor a self-portrait.

Three years ago I began making Steampunk'd Buddies with polymer clay. I have made owls, whales, turtles, ducks, bears, and pigs. At the beginning of 2013 I branched out into vinyl toy customization. The vinyl figurines have been a great deal of fun to work with and I hope to explore using more platforms.This year has been an exciting one and I hope to go out with a BANG with one final 2013 show on December 6th.This is where I need your help. I am most grateful for all the wonderful support that you have shown. What is Needed & What You GetThe funds will go towards:
Printing of the stickers and art prints.  
Display stands for the show.
Paint for the display stands
Clay for the Steampunk'd Buddies
Metal finding and accents for the Steampunk'd Buddies
Blank Google Droids for customization.
Packaging for all pieces.
Fees for any unsold tickets, lighting and transportation costs.
The money will also go towards ensuring my clay and paint stocks are not depleted after preparing for this show so that the base cost of the perks is covered. This will also give me a solid launch for 2014 which will include a new and improved website, new business cards, and of course more shows!Now, for the PERKS. Perk 1: You are AWESOME, and I will tell everyone how awesome you are on both my Facebook and Google+ pages!Perk 2: STICKERS.

Hi there! Remember The Bleachers? With the help of a ton of awesome people, we had a kickass first year. Got listed as a successful project, made a lot of people laugh, and gave a ton of hugs. <div>

<p>While we're taking care of a lot of the expenses for getting back in 2014, there are still a few others we're hoping you can help us with.  These costs break down as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Structural Maintenance/Repairs (Support Beams, Cab/Body repairs) : $400</p>
<p>2.  Mechanical Maintenance/Repairs (New Batteries, Air Filter, Oil Change): $250</p>
<p>3. Generator Rental: $300</p>
<p>4. Sound Rental/Transport: $850</p>
<p>5. Storage: $1500/yr</p>
<p>6. Sexy Scoreboard: $850</p>
<p>7. Insurance: $1500</p>
<p>The total costs of the above ends up around $5,650 - with various other expenses incurred that we're taking care of. At this time we're only looking to raise $3,000 because we had some funds left over from last year, and because we're putting a nice chunk of our own bucks into making this thing a reality.</p>
<p>If this is your first time seeing our project, here's what we're here to do:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Serve as a recursive joke, putting the oft-maligned act of spectating on its head. A platform to turn Spectators into Participants, and Participants into Spectators. Because when someone plops down to spectate with us, to cheer and laugh and separate themselves from the action, they immediately become an active participant and a creator themselves. They prove that observing, understanding and commenting on art are valuable and potentially hilarious pursuits, with a vitality all their own.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Act as a roving stage for improvisational jokes, humor, and general tomfoolery. A place for you to take a break in style at the world's most insane and interactive art festival, unfettered by expectations of actually having to *do* anything, all while enrapt in absurdist play by play announcing and surrounded by people ready to embrace every bit of funny that you want to bring to the table.</p>

Hi there! Remember The Bleachers? With the help of a ton of awesome people, we had a kickass first year. Got listed as a successful project, made a lot of people laugh, and gave a ton of hugs. 
https://www.fest300.com/magazine/7-existential-art-cars-br-at-burning-man-2013


While we're taking care of a lot of the expenses for getting back in 2014, there are still a few others we're hoping you can help us with.  These costs break down as follows:
1.  Structural Maintenance/Repairs (Support Beams, Cab/Body repairs) : $400
2.  Mechanical Maintenance/Repairs (New Batteries, Air Filter, Oil Change): $250
3. Generator Rental: $300
4. Sound Rental/Transport: $850
5. Storage: $1500/yr
6. Sexy Scoreboard: $850
7. Insurance: $1500
The total costs of the above ends up around $5,650 - with various other expenses incurred that we're taking care of. At this time we're only looking to raise $3,000 because we had some funds left over from last year, and because we're putting a nice chunk of our own bucks into making this thing a reality.
If this is your first time seeing our project, here's what we're here to do:

1. Serve as a recursive joke, putting the oft-maligned act of spectating on its head. A platform to turn Spectators into Participants, and Participants into Spectators. Because when someone plops down to spectate with us, to cheer and laugh and separate themselves from the action, they immediately become an active participant and a creator themselves. They prove that observing, understanding and commenting on art are valuable and potentially hilarious pursuits, with a vitality all their own.
2. Act as a roving stage for improvisational jokes, humor, and general tomfoolery.

<p><i>Look what the cat dragged in</i> is conceived in response to the domestic interior of the house. The atmosphere of the space breathes upper-class, traditional heteronormative values and bourgeois decency. But how do we work with/respond to such a charged environment? The 20th-century French thinker Guy Debord coined the notion of <i>détournement</i>: the reworking of an existing cultural element familiar to the audience to give it an antagonistic meaning. Using this as a method, we invite the artists to confront and subvert this environment, and suggest new ways of dwelling and understanding the notion of “home”. <i>Look what the cat dragged in</i> will consist of two parts: an exhibition spread throughout the house and three evenings of performances that will take place in the main living room. </p>
<p>Final list of artists and programme will be released soon!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The space</h3>
<p>The event will take place in an old Georgian house located in the Pimlico area in West London. Almost like a time capsule of upper-class domestic life from the 1970s, but also bearing the marks of all its previous lives, the interior of the house remains in the same state as the old owner left it. In April 2019, renovation works will start, transforming the house entirely. Before this erasing of the ghosts of the past, the house with all its history is available as a space for artistic experimentation. It is precisely this environment, including all its ghosts, that was the starting point of this project for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The performance evenings</h3>
<p>Inspired by the 18th-century French literary salons, we imagined the performance evenings as “radical salons” that will take place in the main living room over the 3 days. Each evening will consist of three performances by different artists. In between performances, there will be time for the audience to get a drink, view the exhibited works and have a conversation with the artists, curators and each other. In contrast to the traditional salon, with its strict set of social codes and etiquettes, the radical salon aims at inclusiveness and real intimacy. A setting where the audience can feel at home.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The exhibition</h3>
<p>The exhibition will consist of a selection of artworks by a few different artists. These works will inhabit various rooms of the house, infiltrating the space to expose its normative power. The audience will be invited to wander around the house to discover it in-between the performances.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Your support is essential for this project to happen since its access will be free. It will help us deliver the creative, qualitative, and ambitious project we imagine. In order to do so, we need a minimum of 785£, which we have budgeted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Production costs: £400</p>
<p>This will cover the basic production costs for the installation of artworks and compensate for performance artists’ material costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel compensation: £100</p>
<p>This will fund return train tickets to London for artists living in other regions of the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drinks and Bites: £100</p>
<p>In the spirit of a relaxed salon, drinks and bites will be available to the audience during and in-between performances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Printing costs: £100</p>
<p>This will cover the estimated printing costs of posters; as well as the leaflet/catalogue including texts by the curators, Guy Debord’s <i>Users guide to Detournement</i>, and creative texts by participating artists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indiegogo fee: £85</p>
<p>This fee includes: the Indiegogo 5% fee on all flexible target campaigns, the Stripe 3% fee, and the £25 fixed fee for transferring the money outside of the US.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am an eighth grader and I love drawing and dogs. Every year, I donate some money made from doing house chores to a dog charity. This year, I want to do more. Inspired by <a href=""http://entrepreneurkid.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Entrepreneur Kids</a>, I have decided to use my talent in art to create a 2018 Paw Calendar. </p>

<p>I have set a goal to raise at least $1,000 from this campaign and donate 50% of the profit to humane society.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dogs are human's loyal friends. 2018 is the year of Dog. To me, there is no better way to show my appreciation of dogs by creating this Paw Calendar. </p>
<p>Inspired by <a href=""http://www.entrepreneurkid.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Entrepreneur Kid</a>, I have decided to use my talent in art to do something for dogs. I drew all the pictures, researched on fun facts about each breed, got helpers to record a video, studied online marketing, and of course, set up Indiegogo campaign. My younger sister Angela also co-starred the video and committed to promote the campaign together with me . This is the first time that we are doing this. It is definitely not easy, but it is totally fun! We really enjoy it! </p>
<p>I sincerely invite you to back our campaign. You are not only supporting my first business, but also doing something amazing for dogs. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have designed the calendar and ordered sample copies from Office Depot already. You can see the samples in the video. We have borrowed $600 from our parents to place the initial order of calendars. So at this point of time, our biggest risk is if we are unable to sell the calendars, we need to find ways to make enough money to pay back our parents. We will probably have to work harder on house chores everyday then. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand there are many campaigns out there competing for your support. No matter if you will directly back our campaign or not, could you please share our campaign on social media to spread the word for us? Thank you! </p>

<p>I am a second generation American painter and artist born and raised in Los Angeles, California. My work has been exhibited in museums, galleries and showrooms and is represented in a number of private collections. Originally trained in a classical, realistic style. I was mentored at an early age by my father, Chet Marshall and raised within a family of artists. While still in elementary school I was introduced to the LA mural culture by working with Jane Golden on the Santa Monica ""Muir Woods"" in 1978 which left a lasting impression on me.</p>
<p>About a year ago I was asked if I would be willing to donate a mural to a children's park in the city of Hawthorne. Since then I began working  diligently on the sketches, designs and presentations for the mural and painted a maquette or small version of what the mural would look like on a 80"" x 30"" canvas.  Painting this mural gives me an opportunity to share my joy and experience of painting with children, their families and passersby in the park.  </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Excited that the city and surrounding neighbors have approved my mural proposal  I am ready to put the mural into production. Production and painting of the mural is scheduled to begin August 16, 2017 but I need your help. In order to cover all of the production expenses required to make this mural a reality we need to raise $2000. This amount will be used for paint, brushes, tarps and all supplies needed to complete this project. I am personally donating an estimated 25 - 30 hours to paint the mural on the 40 foot by 9 foot wall facing the children's park.</p>

</div></div>","For the most update info and lots of pictures: https://www.facebook.com/PlayaBeest/A quick note about or goal: $7500 was my minimum goal to ensure I didn't go too far into debt on this project. I knew up front the total cost will be closer to $15,000. As of September 9th, we've logged many hundreds of volunteer hours and I've spent over $13,700 on materials. Anyone can still contribute to the campaign and claim any of our awesome perks until we break even and stop accepting donations. We'd also love to upgrade the paint beyond primer, add some LEDs, maybe some speakers, etc. So please keep the love flowing and keep spreading the word about this awesome project!

Inspired by Strandbeests, the original   dream machines of artist Theo Jansen, the PlayaBeest will be a 10ft tall, steel, pedal-powered walking machine weighing over 1500lbs that that will be unleashed on Black Rock City at Burning Man 2016!








The key science behind these incredible creatures is the geometry of the leg mechanism. Each leg has 11 segments defined by  13 dimensions that allow the sculptures to glide smoothly across the earth.  Jansen aptly refers to these ""13 holy numbers"" as the Strandbeests' genetic code.


Jansen released this ""genetic code"" out into the wild with the hopes that others would continue the evolution of the Strandbeest by making their own creatures in their own vision.
We've decided to take on this challenge by designing, building, and bringing some kinetic, interactive art to Burning Man 2016!Additionally, we love making kick-ass things we can ride on, especially big, iconic and beautiful things that can be shared amongst our community to enjoy.  Just checkout Nate’s last project where he set a world record flight at Red Bull Flugtag in 2013!

<h3>About</h3>
<p>For the last year, we have been working closely with talented artists of our community to put on a one of a kind exhibition spotlighting contemporary Assyrian art. Our goal is to take a step forward, highlight the present over the ancient, and celebrate contemporary Assyrian artists whose work developed out of a significant and difficult history.</p>
<p>The show title references an Assyrian idiom, “Spring does not occur with one flower alone.” In other words: a movement does not occur with just one person - it takes a field of flowers to bloom in order for Spring to arrive. Diaspora in Bloom brings together the works of a nation that has been scattered around the globe, and has still found a way to blossom into a movement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555174759/kthx8vubedrgwurqrsgf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>History seeped through the cracks despite their best efforts, Esther Elia, 2018</i></p>
<p>Focusing on the Assyrian experience, over 30 works of art will be assembled in a variety of media including - photography, painting, video, posters, and graphic design. The exhibition offers a fresh approach to understanding this ancient culture and addresses universal themes of identity, community, diaspora, and cultural continuity. We are excited to be showcasing the work of many prominent artists such as Esther Elia, Atra Givarkes, Rabel Betshmuel.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My Irish eyes are smiling at the thought of painting Ireland! Cill Rialaig is located on the Atlantic coast of Bellinskelligs, Ireland- a Gaelic speaking town, known for the Skellig Monks who called it ""the nearest thing to heaven"". Before my two week residency I will backpack the Kerry Camino, a pilgrimage trail in County Kerry close to where my paternal great grandmother was born. I hope this journey will fill my soul with narrative imagery to stimulate a rewarding residency.</p>
<p>Over the years I have attended a number of national and international residencies. These funding campaigns have always encouraged me as an artist; knowing there are friends, family, artists and art enthusiasts who understand the value of authentic experiences and focused residencies for my artistic work.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brandon Reno and my senior project is called the Great Barrier Reef Re Imagined.</p>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef Re Imagined is a projector experience in which the audience can see all around them the effects of coral bleaching on the reef between the years of 1950- present day.</p>
<p>This will be done by recreating a section of the reef and animating a time-lapse of the created reef all in Maya. I will then take four different cameras and render four different scenes which will be put into a space in my university library that has 4 projectors, one on each wall, that will each project a different scene that was rendered.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need approximately 500$ to help with the funding of getting photo-realistic plant and animal assets into my scene. This being my senior project I am on a time crunch to get as many assets as possible since I wont have time to model, rig and animate them myself.</p>
<p>Whats in it for you? You get to be apart of something that has never been done. a virtual experience of the effects of coral bleaching on the most beautiful reef our world has. </p>
<p>***ALL CONTRIBUTORS WILL GET CREDIT DURING THE CREDITS OF THE PROJECT***</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help create a never before seen experience where the audience walks into the sad decay of one of the greatest reefs. It will be an experience unlike anything else because you will be in the scene and mobile and able to move around and see everything going on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Still want to help but cant contribute? Tell a friend, spread the word or if you know of any free assets out there let me know!!</p>

<h3>So whats the deal?</h3>
<p>So my buddy has been fighting a workers comp claim both in and out of courtrooms for going on 5 years now. In that time the nerve damage has progressed so far that instead of amputating his foot to stop the spread of the disease. Now the doctors are recommending he amputate the entire leg and even then he's only got a 50% chance that will stop the disease completely.</p>
<p>This is why a couple close friends and fellow artists decided we would do what we could to help out. As the costs for the amputation and the prosthetics will be upwards of 60k. Now I don't think this little sketchbook is going to get him there. But if we can sell a few books to help with costs then I think we can call this a small win towards the end goal.</p>
<p>The first revision of the book is submitted, published and ready to print. If we can make a stretch goal of 3k we will do a second revision before we ship out and add an additional 50 pages of works. With an additional stretch goal every additional 5k adding another 50 pages worth of content.</p>
<p>But if we don't hit the mark all the books will still print and ship out to their new owners. With all the funds going to printing, shipping, and the artists who contributed. With a large portion going to the severely talented Mr Bid to help him through this rough time in his life.</p>
<p>Most of us have never tried anything of this magnitude artistically and this is a huge step for us. So for anyone interested please show your support either by spreading the word, through the purchase of our book, or by donation. It all means the world to have you on board.</p>
<p>So the book is A5 (8.26x5.23) 60# weight on white paper with over 80 pages of concepts, illustrations, and creature designs.</p>

<p>This time, however, we want to launch a completely different project, an absolute novelty, our original idea.</p>
<p>In fact, we want to make available to you these fantastic sculptures of ours, which can be printed directly at home, painted and placed inside your bookshelves to obtain stunning effects!</p>

<p>           -if you already own a 3D printer, it's cheap and also funny, you will print unique and incredible quality models</p>
<p>-If you don't own a 3D printer, it can be an opportunity to buy one! Prices for a printer are already low and accessible to anyone. You can still use a service like: 3D hub, shapeways, or any other that are crowding on the net.</p>
<p>-No shipping cost! Anywhere in the universe, you just download the files and print!</p>
<p>-You can print it as many times as you want, for you and your friends.</p>
<p>-You can decide any printing dimension</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **</p>

</div></div>","Crosslances is an artistic reality consolidated for many years, we have dedicated ourselves very often to model making and playing miniatures in 28/32mm scale.
This time, however, we want to launch a completely different project, an absolute novelty, our original idea.
In fact, we want to make available to you these fantastic sculptures of ours, which can be printed directly at home, painted and placed inside your bookshelves to obtain stunning effects!
 
If you are a passionate reader, or if you simply think it could be the ideal gift for some of your friends, then you can miss this project!

           -if you already own a 3D printer, it's cheap and also funny, you will print unique and incredible quality models
-If you don't own a 3D printer, it can be an opportunity to buy one! Prices for a printer are already low and accessible to anyone. You can still use a service like: 3D hub, shapeways, or any other that are crowding on the net.
-No shipping cost! Anywhere in the universe, you just download the files and print!
-You can print it as many times as you want, for you and your friends.
-You can decide any printing dimension
 
PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **

All models have been sculpted by experienced artists with the help of the Z-Brush program.

These models are designed to be printed without support.
But being complex sculptures it is very important to know how to drive your 3d printer very well.
Crosslances is committed, as always, to help our customers and always find a solution where there is a problem.

Here are our models made!
every sculpture has the possibility to build behind it a structure that allows you to support the books and that adapts to the depth you want.
This is possible with the use of three bars made in three different sizes: long, medium and short that will join to a bottom plate.
All to best adapt to your every need.


For all lovers of horror adventures and mystery tales we have made these two models!


The second series, with two other sculptures, is dedicated to the world of magic and fantasy.



Another series again, this time we go to the classic, entering the fantasy world of dragons and hobbits.



The fourth series projects us into the future, offering these two futuristic city scenarios



The last series is a bit different from the others, we dedicate it to cooking enthusiasts who love to keep their recipes in order!

**the images shown are 3D renderings that represent a simulation of what the final product might look like. Lights and colours are just examples of how to process these sculptures**.

During the campaign we hope to add more new models.
These will be available completely free of charge, along with related pledges.

I’ve worked without colour and with many colours, but every time I gravitate back to the colour pink. It creeps into my unconsciousness. I decided to embrace the colour.</p><p><strong>The colour pink is a colour without much discourse within art. </strong></p><p>You may find the odd article discussing ‘pink art’ although generally the only structural argument is based on the gender normativity of pink is for girls blue is for boys. </p><p><strong>There has never really been a discussion on the actuality of the colour. </strong></p><p>Pink as an emblem for girls, and Barbie in particular have helped to shape my work. During my childhood Barbie was my lifeline. I think she was for many girls my age and this odd feeling of nostalgia and love towards her as well as anger towards Barbie (although more towards Mattel) due to the objectification and unattainable standards created by Barbie, is to be honest – Sublime.</p><p>Working with the sublime, I started focusing on my perception of feminism and gender inequality surrounding my daughter and myself. I started to perceive the world differently, by removing my rose tinted view of the world I started to see even more pink and this imbalance is shown throughout my recent artwork from the limited palette.</p><p><strong>This is something much bigger than myself, the colour pink has become to mean something much bigger than its primary context.</strong></p><p>Pink is often seen as Vulgar or ‘kitschy, it is one of the most vehemently rejected colour of all which only underscores its unusual biologically based effectiveness.</p><p><strong>More recently artists have used Pink as a tool and turn it into an conversation with so many different meanings.</strong></p><p>I want to bring the discussion to the forefront, to look at the love of pink as well as the hatred of the colour.</p><p>I want to express the excessive nature of the colour, and ask the question why?</p><p><strong>I want to open the discussion on the colour pink to different artists all over the world, and I want to combine them all in one place. </strong></p><p>Having an exhibition highlighting the colour Pink just before International Womens' Day is another great way of getting people interested in the discussion of what the colour has become to our society.</p><p><strong>I need YOU and YOUR HELP to make this show become a reality.</strong></p><p>I want to get artists from all over the world involved in this project, and this is where I NEED YOUR HELP!</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>I am asking YOU to submit work! </u></strong></p><p> </p><p>If you are an artist and you want to submit your work please email me at</p><p><u><strong>clarechapmanart@gmail.com</strong></u></p><p>To me it is irrelevant when the work was produced, it could be recent or years ago, I don’t want to limit submissions. as long as your art is based around the colour PINK! please submit!!</p><p>What to send:</p><ul>

As well as featuring the exhibition YOUR HELP will create. WHY PINK?I’ve gravitated to and from the colour pink. I’ve worked without colour and with many colours, but every time I gravitate back to the colour pink. It creeps into my unconsciousness. I decided to embrace the colour.The colour pink is a colour without much discourse within art. You may find the odd article discussing ‘pink art’ although generally the only structural argument is based on the gender normativity of pink is for girls blue is for boys. There has never really been a discussion on the actuality of the colour. Pink as an emblem for girls, and Barbie in particular have helped to shape my work. During my childhood Barbie was my lifeline. I think she was for many girls my age and this odd feeling of nostalgia and love towards her as well as anger towards Barbie (although more towards Mattel) due to the objectification and unattainable standards created by Barbie, is to be honest – Sublime.Working with the sublime, I started focusing on my perception of feminism and gender inequality surrounding my daughter and myself. I started to perceive the world differently, by removing my rose tinted view of the world I started to see even more pink and this imbalance is shown throughout my recent artwork from the limited palette.This is something much bigger than myself, the colour pink has become to mean something much bigger than its primary context.Pink is often seen as Vulgar or ‘kitschy, it is one of the most vehemently rejected colour of all which only underscores its unusual biologically based effectiveness.More recently artists have used Pink as a tool and turn it into an conversation with so many different meanings.I want to bring the discussion to the forefront, to look at the love of pink as well as the hatred of the colour.I want to express the excessive nature of the colour, and ask the question why?I want to open the discussion on the colour pink to different artists all over the world, and I want to combine them all in one place. Having an exhibition highlighting the colour Pink just before International Womens' Day is another great way of getting people interested in the discussion of what the colour has become to our society.I need YOU and YOUR HELP to make this show become a reality.I want to get artists from all over the world involved in this project, and this is where I NEED YOUR HELP! I am asking YOU to submit work!  If you are an artist and you want to submit your work please email me atclarechapmanart@gmail.comTo me it is irrelevant when the work was produced, it could be recent or years ago, I don’t want to limit submissions. as long as your art is based around the colour PINK! please submit!!What to send:

Further I will change the entrance from a double wing door to a fancy glass door as you see in the video. Though I have a small equity I need a little backing to pay the craftsmen and all the stuff. While doing all the work I can do for myself I can’t do the every day work which means lack of jobs and lack of income. When this work is done I need to do some marketing and relaunch my website to tell all the world about what I can do for you.Als erstes werde ich mit dem Innenausbau der Garage anfangen. Im Augenblick ist sie noch recht kalt und zügig. Ich werde auf dem Boden Dielen verlegen und die Wände verkleiden. Außerdem wird der Eingangsbereich erneuert und verbessert –  statt der Doppelflügeltür aus Holz wird eine schöne, helle Schaufenster-Glastür-Kombi eingebaut (s. Video). Zwar habe ich etwas Eigenkapital für dieses Projekt, dennoch brauche ich etwas Rückhalt für die Kosten, die auf mich zu kommen. Außerdem wird hier einiges an Arbeit liegen bleiben, während ich mich um den Ausbau kümmere, gerade die Eigenleistungen sind zeitaufwendig. Auch nach dem Ausbau wird noch einiges zu tun sein: Meine Website werde ich relaunchen und mich um das Marketing kümmern, so dass so viele Leute wie möglich erfahren, was ich zu bieten habe.Here you can get a look at the Tee’s you get for your contribution as a ›real Fan‹.

<p>Greetings to bridge, public art and yarn lovers!  <strong><em>Bridge For Blankets</em></strong> is a community-based knit project, and temporary public art installation, set for install on the Broadway Bridge in August, 2013, as a part of the<em> PDX Bridge Festival</em>.  2013 is the Centennial Anniversary for the Broadway Bridge, and <em><strong>Bridge For Blankets</strong> </em>is our way of drawing focus to this historical structure’s role in the Portland community.</p>
<p>This public art installation consists of 4 -18’ x 21’ knit banners hung outside the drawspans, on both the North and South sides of the Broadway Bridge.  The construction of these banners depends upon the support of 150+ knitting volunteers, local mainly to the Portland area.  After the project has been taken back down, these knit banners will be broken down into 42 - 6’ x 6’ afghans, washed, and donated to Portland area homeless shelters (i.e. Human Solutions &amp; SnoCap).</p>

</p><p><b>WATCH VIDEO ABOVE ^^^^^^^^</b></p><p><b>Who am I? </b>For starts, my name is Jillian Bruschera. Stemming
primarily from my social and artistic engagement with the Columbia College
Chicago community as a student and a teacher, <i>The Mobile Mill</i> isinspired
by three years of arts education in bookmaking, printmaking, and papermaking at
Columbia’s Center for Book and Paper Arts in Chicago, Illinois.  The idea grows from my experience as a
graduate student pursuing a MFA in Interdisciplinary Arts: Book and Paper and
is influenced by my work as an educator. </p>
<p><b>What is The Mobile
Mill?</b> <i>The Mobile Mill</i> is an
automobile outfitted to enable hand papermaking production, popping up
anywhere, at any time. Like food trucks, a studio-on-wheels moves the making
experience to, well, anywhere.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/233397/files/20131130140134-mobilemill_side_.jpg?1385848894"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>The Mobile Mill</i> is
a place where people can learn about paper and how to make paper. It is a space
for new learners, practicing artists and potential collaborators. As a maker
with a considerable interest in repurposing materials, this studio will
concentrate on making paper from paper. Not only are the remnants of our human
consumption free and easily-found, but the use of recyclables also serves to
demonstrate ecological awareness through art education. I will teach
participants how to put discarded paper products to use through hand
papermaking methods. I am currently developing educational materials and
curriculum for workshops, open-studios, and artist-in-residencies.
Additionally, I would like to develop a mobile artist residency, initiate guest
artist-led-workshops, and form cooperative arts initiatives. </p>
<p><b>Impact: </b><i>The Mobile Mill </i>has the potential to
generate a type of interaction with community that considers a larger human
ecology.  I think it is incredibly
important that artists spend time outside of their insular studio practices –
my teaching practice is one means of stretching my artistic practice beyond
myself.  Encouraged by a human
connectedness to others, I aspire to create work that acts as a mediator
between peoples. Art exists between people. As a moving-space able to interact
between edges, <i>The Mobile Mill</i>
considers art-making – in my case, the making of paper – as a way to engage in
a variety of communities and dialogues. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/233402/files/20131130140510-MM_banner.jpg?1385849110"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As a portable space, there are endless opportunities for
collaboration, and locations are perhaps infinite: schools, camps, art
studios/galleries, festivals, farmers markets, craft fairs, pop-ups in parking
lots, parties in the park – anywhere a car can go, this paper truck can go. This
type of mobility is especially important when considering slashes in school
budgets and the subsequent elimination of arts education. A form of creative
pedagogy, a mobile classroom can go into a school and bring an art experience
to a student.</p>
<p><b>Help Me Hit the Road:
</b><i>The Mobile Mill</i> project obviously
requires substantial financing if I am to actualize it. Meaning it simply isn’t
possible without your help. Your donation will help cover the initial costs of:</p>
<p><b>1. Acquiring a Truck:</b>
I need to purchase some sort of used moving van, step-van, retired service
vehicle, or food truck. </p>
<p><b>2. Parts and Labor
for Retrofit:</b> The interior of this truck will be outfitted as a workspace
for hand papermaking. This means “everything that can happen in a fixed paper
studio but on a small mobile scale.” 
Table-top work surfaces, cabinetry for storage, and select machinery
(including a Hollander beater and a drying system) will be built out of
stainless steel and waterproofed wood. I am raising money to cover the costs of
these raw materials. Additionally, I will need to hire and pay a small team of
builders (including a car mechanic, a wood-worker, and a welder) to help get
the job done right. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/233411/files/20131130141102-interior_design.jpg?1385849462"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This truck will, at least, serve as a container for supplies
that can function within the interior of the vehicle <i>and</i> operate independently outside of the vehicle. My designs aim to
maximize the van’s ‘box space’ by creating dual-function elements and
all-in-one machinery. For instance, a pull-out ramp on the back of the truck

primarily from my social and artistic engagement with the Columbia College
Chicago community as a student and a teacher, The Mobile Mill isinspired
by three years of arts education in bookmaking, printmaking, and papermaking at
Columbia’s Center for Book and Paper Arts in Chicago, Illinois.  The idea grows from my experience as a
graduate student pursuing a MFA in Interdisciplinary Arts: Book and Paper and
is influenced by my work as an educator. 
What is The Mobile
Mill? The Mobile Mill is an
automobile outfitted to enable hand papermaking production, popping up
anywhere, at any time. Like food trucks, a studio-on-wheels moves the making
experience to, well, anywhere.

The Mobile Mill is
a place where people can learn about paper and how to make paper. It is a space
for new learners, practicing artists and potential collaborators. As a maker
with a considerable interest in repurposing materials, this studio will
concentrate on making paper from paper. Not only are the remnants of our human
consumption free and easily-found, but the use of recyclables also serves to
demonstrate ecological awareness through art education. I will teach
participants how to put discarded paper products to use through hand
papermaking methods. I am currently developing educational materials and
curriculum for workshops, open-studios, and artist-in-residencies.
Additionally, I would like to develop a mobile artist residency, initiate guest
artist-led-workshops, and form cooperative arts initiatives. 
Impact: The Mobile Mill has the potential to
generate a type of interaction with community that considers a larger human
ecology.  I think it is incredibly
important that artists spend time outside of their insular studio practices –
my teaching practice is one means of stretching my artistic practice beyond
myself.  Encouraged by a human
connectedness to others, I aspire to create work that acts as a mediator
between peoples. Art exists between people. As a moving-space able to interact
between edges, The Mobile Mill
considers art-making – in my case, the making of paper – as a way to engage in
a variety of communities and dialogues. 

As a portable space, there are endless opportunities for
collaboration, and locations are perhaps infinite: schools, camps, art
studios/galleries, festivals, farmers markets, craft fairs, pop-ups in parking
lots, parties in the park – anywhere a car can go, this paper truck can go. This
type of mobility is especially important when considering slashes in school
budgets and the subsequent elimination of arts education. A form of creative
pedagogy, a mobile classroom can go into a school and bring an art experience
to a student.
Help Me Hit the Road:
The Mobile Mill project obviously
requires substantial financing if I am to actualize it. Meaning it simply isn’t
possible without your help. Your donation will help cover the initial costs of:
1. Acquiring a Truck:
I need to purchase some sort of used moving van, step-van, retired service
vehicle, or food truck. 
2. Parts and Labor
for Retrofit: The interior of this truck will be outfitted as a workspace
for hand papermaking. This means “everything that can happen in a fixed paper
studio but on a small mobile scale.” 
Table-top work surfaces, cabinetry for storage, and select machinery
(including a Hollander beater and a drying system) will be built out of
stainless steel and waterproofed wood. I am raising money to cover the costs of
these raw materials. Additionally, I will need to hire and pay a small team of
builders (including a car mechanic, a wood-worker, and a welder) to help get
the job done right. 
This truck will, at least, serve as a container for supplies
that can function within the interior of the vehicle and operate independently outside of the vehicle. My designs aim to
maximize the van’s ‘box space’ by creating dual-function elements and
all-in-one machinery. For instance, a pull-out ramp on the back of the truck
could also operate as a table-top working surface.
Please visit my
Tumblr page www.themobilemill.tumblr.com to view additional design sketches.  I am continuously creating initial sketches
of my vision, though the final design is dependant on whatever truck body I end
up acquiring. These designs continue to change with the research process. I am

<p>
</p>
<p>My name is Stephan Jahanshahi, I am a visual artist working
primarily in photography, and I have been given an extraordinary
opportunity.  This June, I will leave my
home in New York City and depart for the island cluster of Svalbard, where I
will board a sailing vessel to spend the solstice month at sea above the Arctic
Circle with a small group of artists, scientists and educators.  The goal of this expedition is to generate
new work in response to one of the most enigmatic and rapidly changing
landscapes on our planet:  The Arctic. </p>
<p>My initial interest in the Arctic
Circle Residency stemmed from my time in Canada where I began to incorporate
elements of the landscape into my artistic practice, exploring the distance I
felt between myself and the environment. 
I found the static definitions of place, especially in relation to
identity to be problematic and began the first in a number of photographic
series exploring my feelings of displacement. 
My explorations have centered on human impositions upon landscape such
as borders or the narratives surrounding invasive species, linked primarily by
what I consider the failing of static language used to describe a natural world
that is in constant motion and fluctuation. 
</p>
<p>  The Arctic
Circle offers a unique environment to explore these themes as it is the part of
the world that rebels the strongest against our conventional attempts to
navigate, define and classify.  A
conservationist friend and frequent collaborator explained to me that the
Arctic Circle is defined as the latitude at which the sun does not dip below
the horizon on the summer solstice, making it a place defined not by hard
borders or flags but by celestial perspective. 
It struck me as a beautifully exciting idea to define where you are by
the light of the sun.  As so much of my
work has tied understanding where I am to the same constructs as who I am, I
feel a place defined in such an unfamiliar way offers an exciting opportunity
to expand the dialogue within my practice. 
</p>
<p>My practical goals for this
expedition are to come back with the raw materials that will eventually inform
the creation of a body of work to be exhibited and potentially published.  I will be working primarily in digital and
analogue photography as well as video and sound recording, capturing as many
elements of the environment as I can in order to reconstruct and elaborate on
this experience in a foreign place.  To
do this, I need your help.</p>
<p>I am asking for your help in
raising the funds I will need to pay my portion of the expenses for the
expedition, as well as my personal supplies for the trip including film, rental

funding independently, and I am asking you to help me bridge this last

Any leftover that will be put directly into next year's event.    Why are we doing this!? Lots of people make zines and do other creative work in this state but not all of us know each other! We want to foster a community for zine makers, writers, artists and other creative people. 

    Other Ways You Can Help If you don't have extra money, that's okay! We still love you so much.   If you have any services you'd be willing to donate, we'd love that. We're looking for volunteers all the way up to the fest and the day of, too!  Tell your friends about the fest. Share this campaign and ask them to donate. 
Come hang out with us on the day of the event!

Thanks so much, we love you, can't wait to see you at our festival in March!!!

<h2>Why a Badass Women Calendar?</h2>
<p>I was blown away with the support that the 2017 and 2018 Badass Women Calendars received, and I'm so excited that y'all want more!</p>
<p>Since the first Badass Women Calendar I made (right after the 2016 election) I've seen so many other awesome artists creating portraits of incredible women to celebrate their achievements.</p>
<p>In this edition of the Badass Women Calendar, I hope to especially lift up some people who you haven't heard of, or whose badassery you hadn't quite comprehended (...with a few badass classics thrown in).</p>
<p>I also have always strived to include a diverse group of women, with the goal of highlighting folks who haven't traditionally been celebrated. I am increasingly trying to include more international badasses, and especially women of color, indigenous women, and queer women.</p>
<p>I'm excited to announce that this year I will be donating a percentage of the profits from the project to an organization that specifically supports women of color in the US (this is part of my commitment to address racism and sexism through my small business). UPDATE: The nonprofit this project will be contributing to is Black Women's Blueprint.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Getting Going</h3>
<p>Even in August I'd already gotten several requests and questions about the 2019 calendar... so I'm getting going way earlier this year.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to be working with Fireball Printing again to produce the calendar-- a local Philadelphia company I truly admire for its transparency, environmental options, high quality products, and customer service, and they employ a bunch of women.</p>
<p>This pre-order campaign will help me cover the cost of printing.</p>

We believe that we can support those sponsors and donors as equally as they support us, through showing their commitment to the arts to the arts community. 
<p>Much of the funding provided during this Indiegogo will also go towards helping our staff go after long term funding options. We are excited to be working with a newly emerging expert in community and private donor relationships, some of Canada's top grant writers, and an amazing professional sponsorship consultant. Another thing to keep in mind is after our initial $7800, all pennies go into project funding. And you can pick the project you fund. So lets kick it! </p>

</div></div>","Ambiguous Arts is YOUR community support network. For six years we have been working behind the scenes to give artists access to audiences, grants, showcases, collaborative experiences and more. Our mandate is to match emerging artists along side established artists to develop larger audience bases and create mentor ship opportunities, to cross pollinate audiences for interdisciplinary artists, and to allow a space for collaboration and creativity to foster between artists of different mediums, and arts leaders. We are a registered, volunteer run, not-for-profit society supporting BC artists and arts leaders, and have put on 12 interdisciplinary shows, 5 free outdoor one day festivals, 3 fundraisers for other not-for-profits, 4 international showcasing opportunities for artists, mentorship, and much much more. But now we need your help to grow. 


This year Ambiguous Arts is expanding into an umbrella organization that will both continue to start our own initiatives, as well as to support other arts leaders through mentorship, sponsorship, insurance, promotional help, resource sharing, grant support, and not-for-profit status.


""Ambiguous Arts is an organization that makes artists feel like anything is possible. When working with Ambiguous Arts I always know a powerful night is ahead of me. This organization brings art and audiences together in a way that is rare and profound.

""They remind me of the early days of rock 'n' roll, when organizers would promote artists just because they felt those artists had to be heard. Ambiguous Arts pour their heart and soul into every event. Their professionalism and organizational abilities cannot be understated."" 

-James Burrows, professional musician, editor and co creator of The Toronto Tempest, avid Springsteen fan.



We have huge things brewing, including a new career development concert series, ongoing international showcase support for artists, aiding the growth of Seed to Sea, Campbell Bay Music Fest, and Triple A Productions, a new concert series in Victoria whose proceeds will go to an award for BC artists. Along with these initiatives we strive to continuously break down the wall between artist and audience, and to create unique opportunities for experimentation and collaboration.
Ambiguous Arts is also very excited to use our experience and resources to support outside initiatives that need help to get off the ground. 

""Ambiguous Arts is a kick-ass, hoedown-able, exciting, new fashioned, musical, whimsical, fun loving, inventive, foxy, Canadian as hell, serious as shit, group of dedicated adventurers, animators and anarchists. Just the kind of folks that I like to work with…."" 

-Mitch Podolak, founder of Winnipeg Folk Festival, Vancouver Folk Festival, Edmonton Folk Festival, Calgary Folk Festival, and Executive Director of Home Routes


In addition to everything above, other projects we are working on this year include artist residencies, mentorship programs, arts panels, and arts collaborative festivals. 



But to even start towards these goals we have some massive housekeeping that needs to get done. We need to get our skeleton structure strong enough to support these initiatives and that takes funding.
We need $7,800 by Nov 25 to keep our doors open and continue as an organization. This is our very bottom line.
Your donations will help to contribute to:

Insurance Costs
Professional Accounting 
Financial Report Preparation
Funding Applications
Video Production
Initial Project Groundwork

""Campbell Bay Music Festival was built from the ground up following the vision of a group of musicians who wanted to create a music festival for the artists as well as the audience. As it grew in size, so did the challenges of keeping it rolling. Ambiguous Arts Festival Society's mandate resonated very well with CBMF, and as we began working with the Society we were given access to an array of assistance, including sponsorships, grant funding, and simpler licensing.
""The festival is not only made easier by this amazing Non-Profit, but we also get to be a part of a larger arts community. The connections we have made through working with Ambiguous Arts have been valuable and I'm sure they will continue to grow as the society does more and more amazing work within the BC arts and music world.""
-Meg Iredale, Operations Manager, Campbell Bay Music Festival.

We’re asking for your support this one time to help us move into the next phase of not for profit work. After this, we will be working with sponsorship and donor support, as well as grants and city funding. The best part? Your support right now will function as more than just financial support. 
We are going to share the success of this campaign with other funders, to show that we have our community already behind us! So every dollar you donate is more than just a dollar, it is a vote of confidence in our work. 
Once we fund PAST our goal of $7800, any additional funds will go DIRECTLY into project funding. In fact, when you make a pledge PAST $7800 you can CHOOSE which project to fund directly!
Perks
Our perks are based on the complete success of our coming year. Not only do we need to complete this crowd-funding round, but we also need to get project funding for individual projects.If we are able to make our goal here, our team is DEDICATED to completing all of these projects and goals. 
So, take the plunge! 








“I have worked with Ambiguous Arts a few times, and believe they are creating some of the most interesting collaborations and performance works in this country, and they deserve your support.”     

 -Darcy McMurray, Contemporary Dancer and Performance Artist. 

Ambiguous Arts has been dedicated to finding out where artists lack support, and filling that niche for the last six years. Now we are looking to expand that support, both for artists and for arts leaders: those folks working away at organizing and creating amazing events and arts initiatives. 

Over time, together as a community, we can develop and share resources, ideas, and support to help foster a uniquely strong and independent arts community in BC. One lead by the artists and arts leaders themselves.Our team has been involved in various arts initiatives, from management, booking, founding events and festivals, dance, theater, spoken word, and more. 
If you are interested in being involved with Ambiguous Arts, or you have an initiative that you think works with our mandate and vision, please feel free to contact ambigarts@gmail.com. This is YOUR arts not-for-profit. 

""Merridale Cider has always been anything but your run of the mill cider and we love to support amazing not-for-profits like
Ambiguous Arts, who consistently break free from the norm. It is a
very easy choice to support an organization who puts the amount of
love and effort into what they do. Helping emerging artists and
festival is such a great part of  what Merridale does and in return
they help spread what we do to so many wonderful and talented
people."" 
-Jason Child, Merridale Ciderworks


As you all probably know, there are a constant barrage of risks when working in the arts. Funding is one of them. It is important that you know that this initial start up support of $7800 is just our bare minimum to continue on. After this Gogo goal is reached, it will allow us more time to apply for ongoing funding, project funding, organization funding, and to look for donors and private and corporate sponsorship. 

In saying that, we are also only interested in working with folks who share our same vision in community and arts. We believe that we can support those sponsors and donors as equally as they support us, through showing their commitment to the arts to the arts community. 
Much of the funding provided during this Indiegogo will also go towards helping our staff go after long term funding options. We are excited to be working with a newly emerging expert in community and private donor relationships, some of Canada's top grant writers, and an amazing professional sponsorship consultant. Another thing to keep in mind is after our initial $7800, all pennies go into project funding. And you can pick the project you fund. So lets kick it! 

At this moment, our most pressing matter is financial support. We hope you will find a perk that appeals, and help us spread the word! Every share, like, tweet, ello, or mention to a friend is amazing! 
Ambiguous Arts has had the privilege to throw a fundraising event for ArtsWells Festivals of All Things Art. We have also worked alongside organizations such as Music Yukon, Alberta Music, SaskMusic, The Pan Canadian Initiative, Folk Music Canada, Folk Alliance International, OCFF, and many more. 
""The ArtsWells Festival was extremely honoured and overwhelmed by the incredible job that the Ambiguous Arts team pulled off for ""One Night Stand"" in Vancouver, a fundraiser for the ArtsWells Festival in Wells. In addition to performances by some amazing artists, Ambiguous Arts also organized the presentation of visual arts everywhere in the venue and extra fundraising projects like a live auction, silent auction and a kissing booth. They got a huge crowd out, probably due to the professional job that they did with the promo, which included beautiful posters all over town and ads in both the Georgia Straight and the Westender, the later of which also did a story on the event and the festival. 
""So not only did they provide ArtsWells with some much needed funds, they also gave us some incredible profile and promotion in Vancouver. As someone who is always on the organizing side of things, especially when it comes to ArtsWells related events, its was a huge gift to arrive at this event and be able to simply enjoy the evenings festivities. I was thoroughly impressed with the countless hours of work that the Ambiguous Arts Society put into ""One Night Stand,"" as I know what it takes to make an event successful. And to think they did it to support a little festival up north, is truly commendable."" 
-Julie Fowler, Executive Director, Island Mountain Arts.

<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>With the “Chrysalis: A Time of Change” Exhibition, we will showcase the art of a dynamic group of South Florida’s most talented rising artists working in an array of mediums, who are all graduates of the Artist as Entrepreneur Institute (AEI).</p>
<p>This exhibit represents one of the most important annual events for Broward County artists marking a time of change for those on the path of making their art, their business. The exhibit runs from May 29 – June 24, 2017 at ArtServe, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p><i>Our first goal</i><u> </u>is to raise awareness in the broader community -- global and local -- of the high caliber and diverse range of south Florida’s artistic talent. In particular, this exhibit is an opportunity to expand audience for each artist individually and all collectively.</p>
<p><i>Our second goal</i> is to inspire and motivate our selected artists (and future DBA artists) to shoot for the moon in pursuing their passion for creating art and making their art, their business. Unique to this collective of DBA artists is training in social media marketing which builds upon business skills learned during AEI.</p>
<p><i>Our final goal </i>is to reinforce the importance of art and cultural entities as important economic contributors to the community. Your support enables each artist an opportunity to not only exhibit their art, but also sell their art. In doing so, the artists grow as artist entrepreneurs and all involved benefit-the artist, the collector, the gallery and the community.</p>

<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>To be an artist is to see the world in new ways. With “Chrysalis: A Time of Change” Exhibition, we want to help showcase the art of a dynamic group of South Florida’s most talented rising artists, many of whom are emerging or mid-career artists; assist in growing their careers as artists by bringing them well deserved exposure; and help more people feel the benefit of an artist’s attention to – and care for – the surrounding world.</p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Community. Art enriches the entire community, not just those making it. So we want to let the community enrich itself. With your support, we can make sure the “Chrysalis: A Time of Change” Exhibition fulfills its promise for these participating artists. Indiegogo also enables us to share the progress of the artists and the exhibit with a creative and committed global audience.</p>
<h3>What Will Your Contribution Support?</h3>
<p>With your help, the “Chrysalis: A Time of Change” Exhibition can emerge. Your contribution means that associated expenses not covered by the limited budget are met and ensure a successful exhibition. You will quite literally be breathing life into the “Chrysalis: A Time of Change” Exhibition vision. Funding for this project is provided in part by the Broward County Board of County Commissioners as recommended by the Broward Cultural Council.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Phoenix, an award-winning nature and wildlife photographer whose works are collected worldwide, has organized and curated 11 solo exhibits to date, serves as President of the National League of American Pen Women-Fort Lauderdale Branch and has curated numerous juried exhibitions. In partnership with ArtServe, Broward County’s arts incubator, there is little to no risk to prevent the show and the rewards from going forward. Indiegogo is an important ingredient in supporting this project and with a successful campaign, we are confident this project will move forward on schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Can I give for more than one reward?</strong></p>

<p>We are happy to accept donations in any form. Please contact us if you prefer not to use a credit card and we will find a solution.</p>
<p><strong>* What will I receive for Perks with Art ?</strong></p>
<p>With the intent to not burden any one artist more than another, perks that include art (levels $100, $300, $500 and $1000) will be distributed in a random order to ensure that a piece of art from each artist is distributed before beginning the cycle again. Chrysalis artists represent various mediums - including oil, watercolor, glass, ceramic, digital art, silk fabric, porcelain, mixed-media, music and photography - and smaller works and/or quality giclee prints (up to 11""X14"" depending on the artist) without frames will be shipped.</p>

With the “Chrysalis: A Time of Change” Exhibition, we will showcase the art of a dynamic group of South Florida’s most talented rising artists working in an array of mediums, who are all graduates of the Artist as Entrepreneur Institute (AEI).
This exhibit represents one of the most important annual events for Broward County artists marking a time of change for those on the path of making their art, their business. The exhibit runs from May 29 – June 24, 2017 at ArtServe, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Our first goal is to raise awareness in the broader community -- global and local -- of the high caliber and diverse range of south Florida’s artistic talent. In particular, this exhibit is an opportunity to expand audience for each artist individually and all collectively.
Our second goal is to inspire and motivate our selected artists (and future DBA artists) to shoot for the moon in pursuing their passion for creating art and making their art, their business. Unique to this collective of DBA artists is training in social media marketing which builds upon business skills learned during AEI.
Our final goal is to reinforce the importance of art and cultural entities as important economic contributors to the community. Your support enables each artist an opportunity to not only exhibit their art, but also sell their art. In doing so, the artists grow as artist entrepreneurs and all involved benefit-the artist, the collector, the gallery and the community.

<p>Hey! Salut! Halló!</p>
<p>Our names are Selina and Meaghan, and we are two redheaded Canadian artists living in Nova Scotia and Montreal. Our campaign is for friends, family and very generous strangers who want to help us get to the NES Residency in Iceland by September so we can practice what we love. </p>
<p>Together we have worked hard to fund our art and travel, but seeing as most of our working hours are unpaid, we are asking for donations.

<p>It is also important to mention that our intentions of working within the Icelandic landscape will mirror our eco-oriented practice in Canada: remaining respectful and diligent when it comes to natural beauty, conscientious of its rare and fragile ecosystems. Funding this residency will provide us with more financial leniency towards making eco-friendly decisions regarding food, travel and supplies. </p>
<p>There are different ways in which you can support artists, and we’re lucky to receive the loving and motivational support that it takes to keep creating. If you would like to know more about the projects we will be working on, or offer support in other ways, please feel free to contact us by email, or check out our websites (both mentioned above), where you can find our previous collaborations and the Icelandic work (published this winter). </p>
<p>Supporting the Arts is a crucial way of maintaining healthy cultural diversities, allowing for cross cultural discussions, of building new histories, and celebrating the role that beauty still has to play in our world. To work and live as an artist is challenging and has risks, but it is well worth it for us all. Get the word out- We’re going to Iceland! We need your help! We will send your our art!

Our names are Selina and Meaghan, and we are two redheaded Canadian artists living in Nova Scotia and Montreal. Our campaign is for friends, family and very generous strangers who want to help us get to the NES Residency in Iceland by September so we can practice what we love.

I’m Megan Kennedy, a writer and artist from Salt Lake City, Utah and owner of Abuse of Reason Art and Photography. I’ve been doing art for over ten years now, and have been given some amazing opportunities, including being published internationally and working with musicians and authors to achieve their dream project covers. Fans of the official Bioshock Facebook may recognize my work “Rapture”, which was featured there last year and has since become the best-selling print in my gallery.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">For the last two years, I have participated in Craft Lake City, Utah’s second-largest arts festival, and each year has been more successful than the last. I feel my studio is on the cusp of a fantastic explosion into greatness I’ve only yet dreamed of, and I want to give it the rocket fuel it needs to make that happen. </span></span></span></p>
<p><a name=""_GoBack"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Previous years at Craft Lake City, I’ve gone small with only a table set-up and a modest display. This year, with the festival expanding to two days, I want to upgrade to a booth and expanded print selection to draw the crowds in like never before. I’m also looking to be a part of the Urban Arts Festival as well this summer, which is expanding to the Gateway mall. My only obstacle to this goal is being a broke college student. I’m asking for your generous contributions to help me solidify Abuse of Reason Art as a business by investing in a stand-out festival presentation this year.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Contributions to this campaign will be far-reaching and felt long after this festival season is over. Displays purchased for the festivals can be re-used for years to come, allowing me to apply to bigger festivals without worrying about running with the big dogs on presentation. Prints that remain unsold after the festival will immediately be up for sale on my Etsy store, as well as becoming surplus inventory for future festivals, art galleries, etc., which will again enhance my reach to new audiences. Everything this campaign is funding will allow my business to run smoother and reach higher for months and years into the future. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Aside from the material impact, the exposure gained through this festival will obviously impact the growth of my business, and potentially expand my clientele of authors, musicians, etc., who come to me for commissioned work. The money I make from these commissions literally sustains my survival during the school semesters, allowing me freedom to pursue my education whole-heartily. Art is what I love doing, and I would be endlessly grateful if I were able to transform this business into something making enough to contribute to my family’s budget (beyond just surviving).</span></span></span></p>

I’m Megan Kennedy, a writer and artist from Salt Lake City, Utah and owner of Abuse of Reason Art and Photography. I’ve been doing art for over ten years now, and have been given some amazing opportunities, including being published internationally and working with musicians and authors to achieve their dream project covers. Fans of the official Bioshock Facebook may recognize my work “Rapture”, which was featured there last year and has since become the best-selling print in my gallery.
For the last two years, I have participated in Craft Lake City, Utah’s second-largest arts festival, and each year has been more successful than the last. I feel my studio is on the cusp of a fantastic explosion into greatness I’ve only yet dreamed of, and I want to give it the rocket fuel it needs to make that happen. 
Previous years at Craft Lake City, I’ve gone small with only a table set-up and a modest display. This year, with the festival expanding to two days, I want to upgrade to a booth and expanded print selection to draw the crowds in like never before. I’m also looking to be a part of the Urban Arts Festival as well this summer, which is expanding to the Gateway mall. My only obstacle to this goal is being a broke college student. I’m asking for your generous contributions to help me solidify Abuse of Reason Art as a business by investing in a stand-out festival presentation this year.

What This Campaign Will Fund:


Print displays for the larger booth space: We are penny-pinching folk and will stretch every dollar contributed by exploring creative and non-traditional display options, such as old window shutters, magazine racks, etc., to be both budget-friendly and eye-catching for the festival.


Prints: The majority of the contribution will be spent purchasing prints to sell. We will have a range of smaller sizes (4x6-11x14), as well as larger poster-sized prints, and hopefully even a canvas or two available for the festival public.



Various business expenses: Business cards, plastic bags for print purchases, battery-operated lighting for the booth after dusk, clear bags and cardboard backing to protectively package prints, frames for the poster-sized prints, printing of signs/price tags, etc. This will also help us cover the entry and booth rental fees of the festivals.

What You Get:
For a $1 Contribution: You get a ginormous THANK YOU from AOR for your support of the arts. At the festivals, we will have printed a list of names of every donor, and any donation amount gets your name on that list for all the festival to see. Your name will also be entered in a drawing for an 18x20 print of “Rapture”.
For a $10 Contribution: Send us a photo of you, your mom, your dog, whoever, and we will zombify them!
For a $20 Contribution: We will send you a 4x6 print from the AOR Etsy Store, chosen and signed by the artist.
For a $25 Contribution: We will send you a 5x7 print from the AOR Etsy Store, chosen and signed by the artist.
For a $30 Contribution: We will send you an 8x10 from the AOR Etsy Store, chosen and signed by the artist.
For a $50 Contribution: We will send you an 11x14 print from the AOR Etsy Store, chosen and signed by the artist.
For a $100 Contribution: If you are in a band, an author, or have some other comparable project, I will do your cover art. My work has been commissioned internationally by musicians, indie authors, and publishers like Random House; I guarantee you professional quality work. You can find my portfolio at:
http://www.facebook.com/abuseofreason or
http://abuseofreason.deviantart.com
For a $150 Contribution, you have several choices: If you are in a band or an author, I will set up a photo shoot with you and provide you with promo pictures you can use on social media, show flyers, book jackets etc. If you’re SLC local and just need some traditional photos, we can also set up a photo session for anything you want! All options receive a CD with high-res copies of photos, with 10-15 edited, and full copyright release to print and post as you so desire.*
For a $200 Contribution: You will receive both promo photos AND cover art for your project. (SLC locals for photos)*
For a $300 Contribution: We will send you a gorgeous 26x26, ready-to-hang canvas print of your choice from the AOR Etsy Store: http://www.etsy.com/shop/AORArt
For a $500 Contribution: We will send you the 26x26 canvas of your choice, as well as certificate guaranteeing that the print you selected will NEVER be printed in large-format again. You will own the one and only copy of this print in wall-hangable size. (Only exclusion to this being “Rapture”, which has already been printed in large-format prior to this campaign.)
For a $1000 Contribution: I will work with you on a commission of your choice. You don’t have to be in a band or an author; any art you want to see done, I will work with you to create it. Once we create your dream work of art, we will send you a 26x26 canvas print of your commission. This work will NEVER be sold by me in ANY format; not on Etsy, not at festivals, never. It will be a one-and-only piece for you, generated from your beautiful brain.
*Please note: photoshoots are not included for residents outside of SLC. However, if you’re outside the area and willing to come to the Salt Lake Valley at your own expense, arrangements can be made.

The Impact
Contributions to this campaign will be far-reaching and felt long after this festival season is over. Displays purchased for the festivals can be re-used for years to come, allowing me to apply to bigger festivals without worrying about running with the big dogs on presentation. Prints that remain unsold after the festival will immediately be up for sale on my Etsy store, as well as becoming surplus inventory for future festivals, art galleries, etc., which will again enhance my reach to new audiences. Everything this campaign is funding will allow my business to run smoother and reach higher for months and years into the future. 
Aside from the material impact, the exposure gained through this festival will obviously impact the growth of my business, and potentially expand my clientele of authors, musicians, etc., who come to me for commissioned work. The money I make from these commissions literally sustains my survival during the school semesters, allowing me freedom to pursue my education whole-heartily. Art is what I love doing, and I would be endlessly grateful if I were able to transform this business into something making enough to contribute to my family’s budget (beyond just surviving).

<strong>    In 2012 after having a dream about building a 25' high pendulum swing, I got the project funded here on Indigogo and was able to see my swing project on the playa (my virgin burn) making my dream a reality!</strong><br/><strong> </strong><br/><strong>    As I was setting the swing up on the playa my wheels started turning as to what I would be doing to the swing next year! </strong>

<h3><strong>    Since Burning Man 2012 I have begun creating aerial rigs, fire performance props, playa bikes, circus equipment, and some Custom Lighting...</strong></h3>

<p>I’m Eamon Espey,<span> a cartoonist from Baltimore with two books published by Secret Acres, <em>Wormdye</em></span><span> (2008) and <em>Songs of the Abyss</em></span><span> (2012). My drawings have appeared in art shows in such places as New York and Istanbul  and in print in Sweden’s <em>Galago Magazine</em></span><span> and Washington DC’s <em>Bash Magazine.<span>  </span></em></span></p>
<p>For this project, I have collaborated with Lisa Krause to create a puppet show based on one of my comic stories that was collected in my new book.  Lisa is a sculptor and puppeteer who has studied in the Czech Republic and has worked with Bread and Puppet in Vermont.  She’s been an associate artist with Black Cherry Puppet Theater in Baltimore since 2009.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><strong>The purpose of this fundraiser is to raise money to aid in travel cost for our national book and puppet show tour.</strong> </strong>Indiegogo is way for us to get the last amount we need quickly, and offer you our arts and crafts in return.  Although we’ve been working very hard and have already saved a great deal, we’re not rich. Far from it. <strong>We’re putting everything we have into this project.</strong> The $1000 goal we are trying to make here is a only a small fraction of what we have already spent and what we anticipate spending.<strong> <strong>Anything will help and will be deeply appreciated.</strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/fangtooth/8461381989/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""SongsoftheAbyss by fangtooth, on Flickr""><img alt=""SongsoftheAbyss"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8373/8461381989_fc9bdf3523.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>
<p><strong><em>Songs of the Abyss</em></strong> is a graphic novel that diagrams the psychic history of human beings. It is a journey through chaos in search of peace. There are five chapters in which grotesque and spiritual themes overlap. All is rendered in black ink with precision and care. The cover is stained glass. I made it in the basement of our home. <em>Songs of the Abyss</em> is my personal record, creed and poem.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Making a Puppet Show:</strong></p>
<p>There are no words in <em>Songs of the Abyss</em> so that left the question of how would one have a reading for promotional events if there is nothing to read? The answer was very simple and suggested by Lisa.</p>
<p>Together we turned one of the chapters into 22-minute puppet show performance. Although we started with the comic, once we began collaborating new possibilities and interpretations began to emerge. As we continued working the show grew in concept and in scale. The result is unlike any creative project I have ever been a part of.</p>
<p>While we were writing and building, Stephen Santillan was simultaneously composing a soundtrack. He would send us pieces of what he was working on and we show what we were doing. Stephen’s entrancing and ethereal music really helped define the tone and movement of the show. At times it was uncanny how in sync the sound was to the visual elements. We’re very grateful and lucky to have such a talented friend.</p>
<p>Now that we've performed in Baltimore, New York City and Washington D.C., we are taking it on the road. We are packing everything into our 2001 Toyota Corolla and going on 8000-mile road trip.</p>
<p>On that trip, we’ll be performing at a variety of venues across the country and will be at two comics festivals: The Small Press Alternative Comics Expo in Columbus, Ohio and Stumptown Comics Festival in Portland Oregon.</p>
<p>We leave for our first show on April 11, 2013 and last tour date is on May 18, 2013.</p>

<p><strong>The Story of Ishi’s Brain:</strong></p>
<p> <em>Ishi’s Brain</em> is based on the true story of a man that has often been referred to as “the last wild Indian.”  Lisa and my version turn the story into a science fiction ritual where a lone spirit spends his final days and an alien shaman helps guide the dead into the next world.  Although the ideas presented are highly imaginative, the intent comes from a place of reverence and the utmost respect for the original people of America.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>While we are working as many jobs as we can and have almost met our goal, we need your help!</p>

<ul>
<li>($1,200 in gas alone.)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>We've already spent $1,500 on car maintenance in preparation for the trip and around $1,000 to make the show.</p>

<strong>Your contribution in any amount will help ease the burden for us, because we're paying for this all ourselves.</strong><strong>        </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>To thank you for your contribution, we’re offering some great things that have never been available from us before.</strong> Things we’ve made especially for this fundraising campaign- so think of it as a presale or something to get us a bit of gas money!  The rewards include 1” buttons, patches, stickers, t-shirts, posters, replicas of our shadow puppets, a copy of <em>Songs of The Abyss</em>, original artwork published in the book, and more.  Lisa will even make a custom puppet for you.  Seriously. </p>
<p>All donations of $5 or more receive a postcard and 1""button</p>
<p>Custom orders will be received by 2014 and amulets or stained glass before winter 2013</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong><strong> </strong></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve already saved a good percent of our projected costs, and it’s going to happen- it’s just really hard to swallow, because we’re going for broke here. We're putting all we have into this.  It’s been really hard to come up with the money, but it’s even harder for us to ask for help! </p>
<p> </p>

There are five chapters in which grotesque and spiritual themes overlap. All is rendered in black ink with precision and care. The cover is stained glass. I made it in the basement of our home. Songs of the Abyss is my personal record, creed and poem.
 

Making a Puppet Show:
There are no words in Songs of the Abyss so that left the question of how would one have a reading for promotional events if there is nothing to read? The answer was very simple and suggested by Lisa.
Together we turned one of the chapters into 22-minute puppet show performance. Although we started with the comic, once we began collaborating new possibilities and interpretations began to emerge. As we continued working the show grew in concept and in scale. The result is unlike any creative project I have ever been a part of.
While we were writing and building, Stephen Santillan was simultaneously composing a soundtrack. He would send us pieces of what he was working on and we show what we were doing. Stephen’s entrancing and ethereal music really helped define the tone and movement of the show. At times it was uncanny how in sync the sound was to the visual elements. We’re very grateful and lucky to have such a talented friend.
Now that we've performed in Baltimore, New York City and Washington D.C., we are taking it on the road. We are packing everything into our 2001 Toyota Corolla and going on 8000-mile road trip.
On that trip, we’ll be performing at a variety of venues across the country and will be at two comics festivals: The Small Press Alternative Comics Expo in Columbus, Ohio and Stumptown Comics Festival in Portland Oregon.
We leave for our first show on April 11, 2013 and last tour date is on May 18, 2013.
 

The Story of Ishi’s Brain:
 Ishi’s Brain is based on the true story of a man that has often been referred to as “the last wild Indian.”  Lisa and my version turn the story into a science fiction ritual where a lone spirit spends his final days and an alien shaman helps guide the dead into the next world.  Although the ideas presented are highly imaginative, the intent comes from a place of reverence and the utmost respect for the original people of America.
 

What We Need & What You Get
While we are working as many jobs as we can and have almost met our goal, we need your help!

We anticipate our expenses for the tour to be around $5,000.  

($1,200 in gas alone.)





We've already spent $1,500 on car maintenance in preparation for the trip and around $1,000 to make the show.


Your contribution in any amount will help ease the burden for us, because we're paying for this all ourselves.        




To thank you for your contribution, we’re offering some great things that have never been available from us before. Things we’ve made especially for this fundraising campaign- so think of it as a presale or something to get us a bit of gas money!  The rewards include 1” buttons, patches, stickers, t-shirts, posters, replicas of our shadow puppets, a copy of Songs of The Abyss, original artwork published in the book, and more.  Lisa will even make a custom puppet for you.  Seriously. 
All donations of $5 or more receive a postcard and 1""button
Custom orders will be received by 2014 and amulets or stained glass before winter 2013


 
The Impact 


You will be part of us sharing our work. Through your contribution, you will help us bridge communities of puppetry, comics, and music. You can follow our journey on our tumblr/tour blog.


You can feel good because many of the places on our tour will be free/donation based, and others are very low cover.


You can get stuff we made directly from us. Your contribution will help us out now- when we need it most! 


We’ve already saved a good percent of our projected costs, and it’s going to happen- it’s just really hard to swallow, because we’re going for broke here. We're putting all we have into this.  It’s been really hard to come up with the money, but it’s even harder for us to ask for help! 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone can contribute, but here are some other ways you can get involved:


Tell everyone you know about our project.

Loan us your roof rack's cargo box.



Make us some peanut butter & jelly rice cake sandwiches or a mix CD for those long drives on the west coast!

Come see our show!!!

<p>Make Studio’s mission is to provide multimodal visual arts programming, including sales and exhibition opportunities, to adults with disabilities in a supportive and inclusive environment.

In addition, adults with different abilities who would like to pursue arts careers often face social and logistical barriers to starting a sustainable practice on their own. To meet this need, we operate a professionally-equipped, community-integrated studio. Program artists come to the studio to receive individualized facilitation in developing their own artistic styles, learn presentation and marketing skills, and develop translatable vocational skills. Make Studio also provides exhibition opportunities that not only increase self-esteem and sense of community, but often result in sales providing income to our artists.

<p>When a natural disaster strikes, it is the physical devastation that we focus on. Though Sandy hit New York City over three months ago, many of us have horrific images of the hurricane still fresh in our minds. Some of us came out relatively unscathed, but for so many New Yorkers, the reconstruction process has just begun and the emotional devastation remains palpable. The Hurricane Sandy Art Relief Caravan Project was founded to serve the most vulnerable amongst us: children. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our total budget of a full year of weekend programs in these neighborhoods is $73,925.00. These costs cover Caravan staff, art supplies, transportation, meals for participants, and any unforeseen costs related to workshop spaces.</p>
<p>Depending on the number of children and teenagers at our workshops there will be four to eight educators, artists, and art therapists leading the program. Depending on the location and the amount of art supplies we need to rent one to two cars for the day. We plan on serving either one full meal or a snack to all participants depending on the time of day and length of workshop.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Want more details about our program? Here are our project phases:</h3>
<strong>Phase 1:  (Re)building children and youths’ emotional well-being and enhancing resiliency:</strong><br/>Guided self-reflection on the experience of Hurricane Sandy using creative modalities to convey feelings, explore fears, and express hopes and desires; Guided group discussion of experiences and observations; Personal narrative projects that children and youth pursue over the course of a year through video diaries, paintings, comic books, journals, and photography</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Phase 2: Developing skills to deal with stress and conflict:</strong><br/>Workshops for children and youth and their caregivers in conflict resolution and stress-reduction employing creative activities such as improvisation and role-play; Workshops in creating environments conducive to open, supportive communication about Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Phase 3: Encouraging inter-personal communication and establishing the group as a place to learn and practice coping skills:</strong><br/>Regular talk-back sessions for children and youth to share progress of individual narrative projects; Workshops on the global environment and critical analysis of the circumstances leading to the super storm; Joint artistic collaborations to build empowerment; sharing and presentations of art work to families and the public; Forums for inter-generational and inter-cultural communication and dialogue within the surrounding neighborhood leading to the installation of permanent artwork in the participating communities.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Phase 4: Mentor Training &amp; Program Assessment</strong>:<br/>Train teenagers and older children as peer mentors to younger participants; Apply assessment rubric to program including interviews and psychological consultations; Organize think tanks with participants on how the program can be improved.</div>

<h3>Project Outcome</h3>
<p>At the end of the first year of the Art Relief Caravan Project, we expect to see a marked increase in participants’ sense of well-being and hopefulness, feelings of personal achievement and worth, capacity to deal with new stresses and loss as they occur, improved conflict and stress management skills, greater sense of connection to others and use of a group setting for support, better relationships with caregivers, fewer “risky” behaviors, and a deeper understanding of the circumstances and aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.<br/><br/><br/>We would like to thank <a href=""http://hooplaha.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HooplaHa</a> for our wonderful video!

The one-year project targets 200 children and teenagers in the areas of Far Rockaway, Gerritsen Beach, Coney Island and Red Hook.
 
One outcome of the year long project includes four public exhibits of the children's art. SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM TO SEE A FEW OF THESE IMAGES....
 



 

What We Need & What You Get
Our total budget of a full year of weekend programs in these neighborhoods is $73,925.00. These costs cover Caravan staff, art supplies, transportation, meals for participants, and any unforeseen costs related to workshop spaces.
Depending on the number of children and teenagers at our workshops there will be four to eight educators, artists, and art therapists leading the program. Depending on the location and the amount of art supplies we need to rent one to two cars for the day. We plan on serving either one full meal or a snack to all participants depending on the time of day and length of workshop.


Want more details about our program? Here are our project phases:
Phase 1:  (Re)building children and youths’ emotional well-being and enhancing resiliency:Guided self-reflection on the experience of Hurricane Sandy using creative modalities to convey feelings, explore fears, and express hopes and desires; Guided group discussion of experiences and observations; Personal narrative projects that children and youth pursue over the course of a year through video diaries, paintings, comic books, journals, and photography
 

Phase 2: Developing skills to deal with stress and conflict:Workshops for children and youth and their caregivers in conflict resolution and stress-reduction employing creative activities such as improvisation and role-play; Workshops in creating environments conducive to open, supportive communication about Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath.
 

Phase 3: Encouraging inter-personal communication and establishing the group as a place to learn and practice coping skills:Regular talk-back sessions for children and youth to share progress of individual narrative projects; Workshops on the global environment and critical analysis of the circumstances leading to the super storm; Joint artistic collaborations to build empowerment; sharing and presentations of art work to families and the public; Forums for inter-generational and inter-cultural communication and dialogue within the surrounding neighborhood leading to the installation of permanent artwork in the participating communities.
 

Phase 4: Mentor Training & Program Assessment:Train teenagers and older children as peer mentors to younger participants; Apply assessment rubric to program including interviews and psychological consultations; Organize think tanks with participants on how the program can be improved.
 




Project Outcome
At the end of the first year of the Art Relief Caravan Project, we expect to see a marked increase in participants’ sense of well-being and hopefulness, feelings of personal achievement and worth, capacity to deal with new stresses and loss as they occur, improved conflict and stress management skills, greater sense of connection to others and use of a group setting for support, better relationships with caregivers, fewer “risky” behaviors, and a deeper understanding of the circumstances and aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.We would like to thank HooplaHa for our wonderful video! And Tammy Han, for her extraordinary support!
